2/3/2022,"On Feb. 1, the US Treasury Department reported the national debt hit a record $30 trillion, prompting much hand-wringing about the fragility of the US economy. Around $8 trillion of that $30 trillion cited by debt hawks as what the government has borrowed is the equivalent of that: Money that the government owes to itself in the future, says J.W. Mason, an economist professor at CUNY’s John Jay College.

2/3/2022,"Futures tied to Wall Street’s key benchmarks were mixed heading into overnight trading Wednesday after stocks closed higher for the fourth straight day on the heels of Big Tech earnings. However, the winning streak in equities was eclipsed by disappointing fourth quarter results from Facebook parent company Meta (FB), which reported figures that missed estimates after the bell on Wednesday. The results sent shares tumbling more than 20% in post-market trading. Contracts on the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.68% following results, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were muted.  Meta reported Q1 2022 revenue, a key figure for stock watchers, that came up short, with the company estimating between $27 billion to $29 billion in the current quarter, below analysts' expectations of $30.25 billion. The company’s ability to continue to navigate Apple’s (AAPL) recent privacy changes that allow iOS users to opt out of letting their apps track them across the web was also in focus for the near term. Facebook's fourth-quarter report comes amid a prolific week in earnings season. Amazon (AMZN) is set to unveil figures after market close on Thursday, marking the last of five corporate heavyweights that account for about one-quarter of the S&P 500’s total market capitalization to reveal 2021 year-end performance figures. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL), which released its results on Tuesday, surged in Wednesday’s session after the tech giant topped quarterly sales and profit estimates and announced a 20-for-1 stock split. Investors weighed Big Tech earnings against a jarring employment report out Wednesday. ADP reported that private-sector U.S. employers cut 301,000 jobs in January, marking the first decline since December 2020 as the Omicron variant put a dent in the labor market's recovery. “The takeaway for investors is probably a temporary blip on an otherwise strong recovery we're seeing in the employment markets,” SEI CIO Jim Smigiel told Yahoo Finance Live. “It’s not too surprising we're seeing a bit of weakness."" ADP’s report was a prelude to the Labor Department's official monthly jobs report due out Friday. Consensus economists expect 150,000 non-farm payrolls returned in January, a figure that would mark the slowest pace of hiring since December 2020 as the impact of the latest COVID waves catches up to economic data. ""It’s one of those things where we’re just going to have to get used to the short but shallow economic damage we saw because of the latest variant,” Art Hogan, B Riley-National chief market strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live. Jared Bernstein, member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, emphasized to Yahoo Finance Live that this month’s figures are likely to be “distorted” by a number of Americans who have tested positive for the virus in the latest surge on unpaid leave that are not tracked on the payroll count. Anxiety around central banking policies rattled markets in January. The S&P 500 posted a negative return of 5.26% for January 2022 – marking its worst month since the benchmark plunged 12.5% in March 2020 after COVID-19 upended the global economy. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) narrowly avoided its worst-performing January on record after a loss of 8.98% for the month. As stocks appear to crawl out of their January rout, some strategists contend the worst of Fed jitters could be behind us. “In some ways, we might be at peak hawkishness in terms of market expectations,” Tony DeSpirito, CIO of BlackRock’s U.S. Fundamental Active Equity arm. “We certainly saw that in January, and late last year — a change in tone from the Fed and now the market has reset expectations and starting to price them in.” Sawchuk Wealth founder Terry Sawchuk told Yahoo Finance recent hawkishness from Fed policymakers has stemmed political pressure to look like they're fighting inflation. ""I think the Fed's going to back off of all of this at some point,” he said. — Here's how the main benchmarks fared in extended trading Wednesday evening: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): -32 points (-0.70%), to 4,545.25 Dow futures (YM=F): +44 points (+0.12%), to 35,536.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): -260.75 points (-1.68%) to 14,853.75 Crude (CL=F): -$0.43 (-0.49%) to $87.83 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$2.70 (-0.15%) to $1,807.60 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -3.4 bps to yield 1.7660% — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2/3/2022,"Spotify (SPOT) reported fourth quarter financial results on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations — although the stock plunged after the company gave weak guidance on monthly active users for Q1 2022.  Here is how Spotify performed this quarter, compared to analyst expectations, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Revenue: $3.025 billion (+24% Y/Y, +8% Q/Q) versus $2.98 billion expected  Adjusted loss per share: -$0.23 versus -$0.44 expected  Premium revenue came in at $2.58 billion — up over 22% — whereas ad-supported revenue came in at $443 million.  The company addressed the public outcry over Joe Rogan during the earnings call, as musicians David Crosby and Stephen Stills announced within the last few hours that they'd be joining Neil Young in pulling their music off Spotify in an effort to oust Rogan— by far Spotify’s most popular personality, with 11 million listeners. The platform signed a reported $100 million deal with Rogan back in 2020. During the call, CEO Daniel Ek reinforced his message from Sunday, detailing how Spotify has already implemented ""several first-of-its-kind measures to help combat misinformation and provide greater transparency,"" adding that Rogan must abide by the platform's content policies.  The executive went on to say that Spotify has ""a critical role to play in balancing creative expression with the safety of our users,"" noting that ""there's still work to be done."" Ek previously emphasized that the company would not ""take on the position of a content censor."" For the current quarter, total monthly active users (MAUs) came in at an impressive 406 million— near the top end of the company's guidance range between 400-407 million. However, the stock swooned by over 15% in after-hours trading, after the company forecasted 418 million MAUs for the upcoming quarter — missing estimates of 422 million. Total premium subscribers for Q4 totaled 180 million (up 16% year-over-year and 5% higher quarter-over-quarter), which also fell near the top of the company's guidance range between 177-181 million. Ad-supported MAUs settled at 236 million (+19% Y/Y, +7% Q/Q).  Spotify currently has users in more than 184 countries and markets, and is far and away the leader of the pack, capturing 31% of total U.S. subscribers, followed by Apple Music (AAPL) at 15%, and Amazon Music (AMZN) and Tencent (TCEHY) tied at 13%. YouTube Music (GOOGL) rounds out the top five at 8%. In spite of the outcry over Rogan, however, analysts have reiterated their bullish stance on the stock with some of Wall Street's top banks citing potential, untapped upside. Citigroup (C) upgraded Spotify from ""Neutral"" to ""Buy"" earlier this week, spurring a 12% intraday rally, as it crediting the company's ability to improve ad-supported monetization.  And on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley (MS) said that although ""technical aspects"" have weighed on shares, the music streaming giant could both accelerate user growth and expand gross margin this year, based on its unique position in the market.  Morgan Stanley noted that while Spotify's Joe Rogan backlash is ""clearly not a positive for shares,"" the debate was ""not the first of its kind on a major audio platform and likely will not be the last."" Data suggests Spotify is backed by the increasingly lucrative economics of streaming, especially as digital media continues its growth, and its massive scale. The effects of similar controversies on Netflix (NFLX), which faced similar outrage over ""Cuties"" and Dave Chappelle's comedy special, had a negligible impact on its stock. ""I personally don't think that paying subscribers will leave a platform because there's one program that is being disputed,"" Ola Sars, founder and CEO of B2B music streaming company Soundtrack Your Brand, told Yahoo Finance during a recent interview.  ""[Spotify] has been through this before, so has all of the other media platforms, and consumers kept paying the bill...This is probably not the only situation where certain artists don't like other types of content,"" the executive continued.  Alexandra is a Producer & Entertainment Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.

2/3/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Retail traders sold the ETF dip, hedge funds bailed at the fastest rate in five months, and institutions cut allocations to lows unseen since the financial crisis. Then the tech megacaps staged an $870 billion comeback. Most Read from Bloomberg U.K. Scrambles Fighter Jets to Intercept Unidentified Aircraft Teen Who Demanded $50,000 From Elon Musk Is Now Targeting More Billionaire Jets Omicron Sub-Variant May Cause New Surge of Infections in Current Wave Late Earnings Sink Tech After Stocks Close Higher: Markets Wrap Tesla, Who? Biden Can't Bring Himself to Say It — and Musk Has Noticed It’s something few investors saw coming, after a hawkish Federal Reserve sparked a violent new-year rotation out of growth companies like software and into cheap, economically sensitive shares. Yet as Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. joins Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. in reporting robust results, both day traders and Wall Street pros risk getting blindsided by the rebound in the famous tech cohort known as Faang. “Growth and tech have seen a major reversal off the lows,” said Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “The quick turnaround is likely causing pain not only for investors that have shunned Tech but also some near-term pain for short sellers.” It’s a lesson for anyone betting that the heydays are likely over for the Faang grouping, which also includes Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. While the pandemic-era safety trade in large-cap equities is on the wane, this earnings season is showing yet again the dangers for anyone shunning these reliable profit generators. Almost $1 trillion has been added to the total value of Faang stocks as the group surged 10% over past six days, buttressed by better-than-expected earnings. Facebook announces results after market close Wednesday, while Amazon.com reports Thursday. Read: Tech Gets Crushed Again on Traders’ Jitters Over So-So Earnings The Faang bloc is still down 4% this year, in line with the broad S&P 500. But a lasting rebound would be bad news for those who have avoided tech stocks. In Bank of America Corp.’s January survey of global fund managers, net allocation to the sector fell to the lowest level since 2008. Hedge funds raised bearish bets and sold long positions, cutting tech’s relative holdings to the lowest level on record in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s prime-broker data. While retail investors bought the dip in the broad market, Invesco QQQ Trust (ticker QQQ), the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, suffered outflows of $6 billion in January, the largest monthly withdrawal in two decades. Meanwhile, short wagers against QQQ climbed above 5% for the first time since the 2020 pandemic bear market, data compiled by IHS Markit show. For the first few weeks of 2022, such skepticism paid off. What started as an aggressive selloff in speculative corners spread to the rest of the market, and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled 15% from its November peak. Then the tide started to shift once tech giants reported results. Last week, Microsoft’s forecast on its Azure cloud-computing business soothed investor concern about a slowdown and Apple demonstrated the company’s ability to navigate a difficult supply environment. Google on Wednesday added to the latest evidence of Faang resilience, posting a surge in advertising revenue. The Nasdaq 100 has climbed four days in a row. Along the way, the benchmark gauge approached its 200-day average, a key long-term trendline widely watched by investors. “Ultimately these are companies that do have access to some of these long-term secular growth stories,” Meera Pandit, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg TV interview with Jonathan Ferro. “As growth slows in the second half of the year, investors are going to need growth in their portfolios, and these are some of the interesting core holdings.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek First Black Woman Picked for Fed Draws GOP Fire Over Research Rent Inflation Shows That Landlords Have the Upper Hand Again Nurses Who Faced Lawsuits for Quitting Are Fighting Back China’s Local Governments Are at Risk of a Puerto Rico Moment Google Is Searching for a Way to Win the Cloud ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•8 hours ago,Faang Stocks Blindside Traders With $870 Billion Out-of-Nowhere Surge,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/870-billion-faang-jump-last-174350705.html
