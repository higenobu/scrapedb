3/9/2022,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Ukraine will repatriate troops and equipment, including helicopters, involved in U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa and Europe to bolster defences at home in the face of Russia's invasion, a U.N. official said. Russian troops invaded Ukraine nearly two weeks ago, shelling, bombing and besieging its cities and towns and forcing more than 2 million people, mostly women and children, to flee. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a decree on Tuesday recalling all peacekeeping forces in order to assist in the war effort at home, Ukrainian media reported. Ukraine contributes about 300 troops, police officers and staff to six U.N. missions, a number unlikely to drastically alter peacekeeping operations globally. Its biggest contribution by far, to the mission in Democratic Republic of Congo known as MONUSCO, comprises eight Ukrainian helicopters and a 250-member aviation unit, a MONUSCO spokesman said. ""We have received notification from Ukraine regarding the repatriation of their equipment and contributions to peacekeeping,"" the spokesman told Reuters, adding that the pullout included all U.N. missions with Ukrainian involvement. ""At the moment we are evaluating what impact this retreat could have on our mission and how we can minimise it."" Ukraine also contributes a dozen or fewer police officers and other staff to U.N. missions in Mali, South Sudan, Sudan, Cyprus and Kosovo, the U.N. peacekeeping website says. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and foreign volunteers have signed up to fight, and Western countries have contributed equipment, but Ukraine's military capabilities remain dwarfed by those of its giant neighbour. MONUSCO has about 12,000 troops deployed, most in Congo's mineral-rich east, where dozens of militia groups are fighting for control of land and resources. The Ukrainian helicopters are based in the eastern towns of Goma, Bunia, Bukavu and Beni, MONUSCO said. Russia describes its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" designed to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" Ukraine.

3/9/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -The Kremlin accused the United States on Wednesday of declaring an economic war on Russia that was sowing mayhem through energy markets, and it put Washington on notice it was considering its response to a ban on Russian oil and energy. Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed heavy sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cast the West's sanctions as a hostile act that had roiled global markets and he said it was unclear how far turbulence on global energy markets would go. ""You see the bacchanalia, the hostile bacchanalia, which the West has sown - and that of course makes the situation very difficult and forces us to think seriously,"" Peskov told reporters. ""We see that the situation on energy markets is developing rather turbulently - and we don't know how far that turbulence will go,"" Peskov said. He declined to outline the exact nature of Russia's response. The West's attempt to cut off Russia - one of the world's biggest exporters of oil, gas and metals - has hit commodity markets and raised the spectre of spiralling inflation across the world Russian President Vladimir Putin says the ""special military operation"" is essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the NATO military alliance to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China, the world's second largest economy, has called for restraint but President Xi Jinping has cautioned that sanctions will slow down the world economy. ENERGY POWER Russia said on Monday that oil prices could shoot up to over $300 per barrel if the United States and European Union banned imports of crude from Russia. Brent hit $139 on Monday, its highest since 2008. Russia says Europe consumes about 500 million tonnes of oil a year. Russia supplies around 30% of that, or 150 million tonnes, as well as 80 million tonnes of petrochemicals. Asked about a ban on Russian oil and energy imports announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, Peskov said Russia had been, was and would be a reliable energy supplier. Moscow would, though, now think very seriously about a response, Peskov said. ""The situation demands a rather deep analysis - those decisions announced by President Biden,"" Peskov said. ""If you are asking me what Russia is going to do - Russia is going to do what is necessary to defend its interests."" ""The United States definitely has declared economic war against Russia and is waging this war,"" he said.

3/9/2022,"Ukraine has alleged that members of Russia's mercenary Wagner Group are fighting there. Officials on Tuesday shared photos of a dog tag it said belonged to a killed member of the group. Recent reports said Wagner Group agents were ordered to hunt and kill Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine's defense ministry posted photos of a dog tag it said belonged to one of the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary group said who were said to be charged with assassinating President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Wagnerists are already dying on the territory of Ukraine,"" the defense ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post accompanying the photos. The defense ministry did not say how many people had been killed or how many dog tags it had collected. The photo of the dog tag showed, on one side, a website, a phone number with a Syrian country code, and an email address. The other side said ""Please help and contact us"" in English, French, and Arabic. The defense ministry said the dog tag was made for use in the Syrian war, which the US believes the Wagner Group was involved in. Multiple reports from 2017 and 2018 said the group was contracted by a Syrian state-owned oil company to capture and secure oil and gas fields from ISIS. Insider was unable to access the website inscribed on the dog tag, and received an automated message saying the phone number was unavailable. Upon contacting the email address for a request for comment, Insider received an auto-reply that said:"" This email address has been hijacked by Anonymous. You can respond, I am reading all emails. Glory to Ukraine!"" After asking who the email address belonged to, the person operating the account told Insider that they took over the email account after seeing the dog tag photos, and that it was not clear if it previously belonged to the Wagner Group. In its Facebook post, the Ukrainian defense ministry said the Wagner Group was helping Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, and that some of its agents were ""already participating in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine in the army of the aggressor."" It is not entirely clear who runs or finances the Wagner Group, but Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been most frequently linked to the organization. In 2020, the US Treasury said Prigozhin was ""believed to be the financier"" of the group. The European Parliament also described Prigozhin as having financial links to the group. Multiple reports published in the run-up to and during Russia's invasion, including by the Daily Beast and The Times of London, said Wagner Group mercenaries were being dispatched to Ukraine. The Times of London reported late last month that Russia ordered Wagner Group mercenaries in Kyiv to wipe out Zelenskyy's government, and offered them financial bonuses if they succeeded. The Times reported last week that Ukraine had foiled at least three assassination attempts by the Wagner Group and Chechen special forces on Zelenskyy in the prior week, without giving specifics. Zelenskyy previously warned that he was the ""number one target"" for Russia.

3/9/2022,"Jacksonville Realtor Sharice Williams has dealt with many intense situations in her career, but none as bad as a discussion with one angry man. ""We hear a man’s voice from the fence,"" Williams said. ""Startled, I answer, 'Sir, I’m a Realtor with my clients,' and clearly that wasn’t a good enough answer. This man, the next door neighbor, continues to cuss and yell very very hostile-like, and I’m continuing to say, 'Sir, please calm down. I’m a Realtor with Coldwell Banker. This house is for sale. I have my clients with their kids. Please calm down.'"" No question, it's something Williams wants to forget. Thanks to a Jacksonville native known for various inventions, the chance of this happening again could decrease. One year after creating ""The Pullover Pal,"" a product designed to hold all of the important documents needed if you are pulled over, Ronnie Fulcher has a new invention — a sign to help limit confusion in neighborhoods where real estate agents might be working, thus eliminate potentially hostile interactions. ""I love Jacksonville but sometimes it can be challenging being a Realtor here and especially being a woman of color,"" said Williams, who is not only a Realtor with Coldwell Banker SeaCoast Advantage, but also a Marine veteran. Fulcher became an inventor to create products that would help improve interactions between law enforcement and citizens. More from Fulcher: Jacksonville inventor hopes device becomes part of history, changing police perspective The signs Fulcher has created, which differ for real estate agents, building inspectors and property preservation workers, were created to keep those who are doing their jobs from getting the cops called on them, as well as keep neighbors from reacting harshly when they see someone in an uninhabited house. ""Mainly you have neighbors, or people that see a real estate agent and they may think they're breaking into a home or something, and automatically call the police,"" Fulcher said. ""And from people I know, sometimes the police show up with guns blazing, 'get on the ground,' and handcuffs. So, with the sign, they'll see it, and they may think, 'Well, they could be a real estate agent.' They may not come with the guns blazing, they may actually talk, which will help both sides."" Fulcher said he came up with the idea from watching YouTube videos of what's happening to real estate agents. Williams bought a sign from Fulcher after the interaction with the angry neighbor, and said she uses it all the time. Williams' incident took place a few months ago, when she was helping friends sell their home and look for a bigger home. The wife works full-time from home, the husband is active duty, and they have children involved in sports, which made scheduling difficult. Because of this, she scheduled a showing at 7:15 p.m., even though she said she typically doesn't like to show homes after 5 p.m. For some reason, the power in the home was off. Despite this, the showing continued and they used flashlights. A for sale sign was in the yard, so Williams said she didn't think anything else of it. After the showing, Williams and the family were standing on the patio talking, when the man began to yell at them, despite the two children standing there. ""I didn’t know if this man was going to start shooting or what at us,"" Williams said. ""I was almost frozen out of fear. Finally, after pleading with him to calm down and to stop cursing because kids are here, he did, and told us he saw the flashlights and thought someone was trying to rob the place."" The incident kept the family from buying the home, and Williams said she was still shaking when she got home. ""I made this to help,"" Fulcher said. ""It’s been going well and I have gotten good feedback."" Williams said Realtors typically carry a little ""pocket card,"" with their name, firm name, and license number to help identify themselves if needed. She also wears her name tag. The Jacksonville Police Department reported eight calls in 2021 that were listed as mistaken identity. That could be anything from a real estate agent, contractor, cleaning crew or other workers. While not all cases are reported, Jacksonville Police Chief Michael Yaniero still encourages people to report suspicious behavior because identifying a home as ""not inhabited"" could signal potential thieves. ""Many crimes, especially burglaries, are crimes of opportunities,"" Yaniero said. ""A house under construction or for sale is unoccupied, so it does not have the usual level of guardianship, so tapping into the neighborhood watch organization might be a way to increase guardianship."" To better avoid mistaken identity, Yaniero encourages people who are remodeling their homes to provide police with an after-hour contact in case calls come in about the home. ""The contact could be added to our Computer Aided Dispatch, and we could call in the event we receive a call for service at that home and the officer would be notified the home is for sale or under construction,"" Yaniero said. As for signs to alert people about houses being shown or work being done, Yaniero still urged caution. ""While we appreciate the idea, it always is better for us to respond to check on the situation,"" Yaniero said. Fulcher believes police will be called regardless of the signs, but they could change how police react when they arrive. ""In America, some are guilty until proven innocent, and that really pertains to minorities,"" Fulcher said. ""I've had many orders for signs, people really think they help. I think it can really help. It's not the solution, but I hope the signs are a step in the right direction.""
