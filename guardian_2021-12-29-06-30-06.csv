12/29/2021,"The UK’s energy crisis deepened last week after gas market prices surpassed the record highs set in October to reach a new all-time high of £4.50 per therm, about nine times higher than this time last year.  The latest gas price spike was ignited by concerns over Russia’s gas exports to western Europe, but further hikes are still possible this winter if supplies are disrupted or a cold snap boosts demand for gas heating. The new record has fuelled concerns that household energy bills will continue to rise and that households will be forced to shoulder the cost of more energy suppliers going bust which is already nearing £2bn. Rising energy costs are also likely to spell trouble for factories and businesses, and contribute to cost inflation across the UK economy. Energy bosses have met the government for emergency talks and have described the latest hikes as a “national crisis” and an “enormous crisis for 2022”. Energy bills are expected to keep rising at least until 2023, according to energy bosses. There is no sign that energy market prices will begin to fall and the cost of failed energy suppliers – which is paid through energy bills – is expected to continue to rise. Household bills reached a record high in October after the price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, reached an average of £1,277 a year for a dual fuel bill. The price cap is expected to rise by 50% when Ofgem recalculates its level in April, and will probably climb above the £2,000 mark by the end of the year. The bill hike is likely to plunge millions of households into fuel poverty and cause struggling small businesses to go bust. For large energy users, such as manufacturers, the record gas prices could lead to reduced working hours or lay-offs to help manage their costs. The government can’t do much about surging global energy markets, but senior energy industry leaders have set out a string of options to help contain the crisis. Energy bosses have suggested that the Treasury could cut bills by 5% by waiving the VAT rate on gas and electricity, or moving the policy levies paid for through bills into general taxation. The Labour party has argued that the higher VAT revenues already paid this winter through energy bills could more than offset the impact of these proposals on the government’s coffers. But the Treasury has disputed this. Others, including Ecotricity founder Dale Vince, have argued that the Treasury could raise the funds needed to subsidise energy bills through a windfall tax on North Sea gas producers which are due to make record profits from the gas crisis. Finally, government officials are reportedly considering making loans of up to £20bn available to energy companies to cover the cost of rising market prices which could be paid back over years, according to the Daily Telegraph. The scheme would help companies weather the crisis without passing on bill hikes in the short term. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, met energy bosses for emergency talks on Monday but failed to reach a resolution. Before the crisis hit the answer to this would always have been to shop around and make sure that you were on the best tariff, but now it’s wise to stay put – this is because most of the deals being advertised are expensive ones. The price cap means that if you are on a standard variable tariff you will be better off than if you move. Instead you have to focus on consumption, and see if there are ways you can cut how much you use. Some of the best ways to do this cost money, but will be worth the investment if prices stay high. Insulating your home is important, as that means you won’t be wasting money on heating: fill cracks around doors and windows and between floorboards, buy draught excluders for any chimneys and for doors, make sure your loft, if you have one, is insulated. The Energy Saving Trust says insulating a loft will typically cost £300 for a semi-detached house and shave £165 a year off bills. When you replace products, check the energy ratings and buy the best you can afford – or, if it’s a tumble dryer, ditch it and use a clothes airer. There are things you can do for free – for example, switching off lights when you leave a room, putting on another jumper and turning down the heating, bleeding radiators and more. Limiting time in the shower to four minutes each could save a typical household £45 a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Installing solar panels or an air source heat pump will be a bigger job and involve more initial outlay but should cut your bills. There are several places to source help with your bills. The government offers several schemes: the warm home discount for people on low incomes offers a £140 discount on electricity bills, the winter fuel payment is available to people born on or before 26 September 1955 and automatically gives you up to £300 a year, and cold weather payments are available to people on benefits when the average temperature drops below zero. Suppliers have hardship schemes for those in debt – ask yours, and also check the British Gas Energy Trust as its scheme is open to all. You can find out about local grant schemes at simpleenergyadvice.org.uk/grants. If you are not on a low income but have been told to work from home this year, make sure you have claimed tax relief for doing so as this will help towards your bills. It’s not an option if your employer has been giving you cash towards costs, but otherwise it is worth £62.40 to a basic rate taxpayer and £124.80 to a higher rate taxpayer. It takes minutes to claim, and you can get the full year’s rebate if you have done just one day at home since April.",News/UK news,Why is the UK facing an energy crisis and how do we cope with it?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/why-is-the-uk-facing-an-energy-crisis-and-how-do-we-cope-with-it
12/29/2021,"Newcastle’s game at Everton on Thursday has been called off because of injuries and Covid-19 cases within the Magpies’ squad. Eddie Howe said on Monday that Newcastle were “dangerously close” to being unable to field a team for the fixture at Goodison Park following their 1-1 draw with Manchester United.  Newcastle were only able to name eight substitutes, including two goalkeepers, and then lost Callum Wilson, Ryan Fraser and Allan Saint-Maximin to injuries during the match. Furthermore, Javier Manquillo received his fifth booking of the season to earn a suspension. A statement from the Premier League on Tuesday evening read: “Everton’s match against Newcastle at Goodison Park, due to be played at 1930 on Thursday December 30, has regrettably been postponed. “The board accepted Newcastle’s postponement application as the club does not have the required number of players available for the match (13 outfield players and one goalkeeper), due to Covid-19 cases and injuries. “The board was able to make its decision in advance of the fixture to give clarity to the affected clubs and their fans. We apologise for the inconvenience and disruption caused to supporters’ festive plans.” This the latest Premier League match to be postponed this week after Arsenal v Wolves and Leeds v Aston Villa, which were due to be played on 28 December.

12/29/2021,"An unusual source of ancient human DNA could help scientists unpick details of our ancestors’ lives and answer longstanding questions. The source? Nit glue. Scientists studying mummified remains from South America that date back 1,500-2,000 years say they have recovered ancient human DNA from the sticky cement produced by head lice to anchor their eggs to hair.  While a number of groups have looked at the potential of parasites to help explore our past, the researchers say the new discovery is the first time nit glue has been found to be a source of ancient human DNA. The revelation is a boon given the difficulties typically involved in extracting DNA, and the damaged state it is often found in. “By genetically characterising a human host using just a handful of nits, we prevent the destructive sampling of bones and teeth that deteriorate or destroy unique ancient specimens. This also prevents conflicts with indigenous related people as the mummies or skeleton are left intact, only a few hairs containing nits are sufficient,” said Dr Alejandra Perotti of the University of Reading, who led the research. What is more, the team found the nit glue yielded the same proportion of human DNA as found in a tooth, and twice that found in the petrous bone of the skull. “The other thing that we also find is that within the cements, within that glue of the nits, DNA seems to be preserved or protected better from chemical damages, [compared to DNA found in the tooth or bone],” said Dr Mikkel Pedersen, of the University of Copenhagen, another author of the research. The study, published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, reveals how a team of researchers from the UK, Denmark and Argentina analysed the remains of eight South American mummies as a proof of concept for the approach. The team were able to extract not only ancient human nuclear DNA but also mitochondrial DNA of the lice themselves from the nit cement of two of the mummies, with analysis of both revealing the same story: the mummified individuals were part of a population that migrated from north-west Amazonia to the Andes of central-west Argentina 2,000 years ago or earlier. This confirmed previous theories based on evidence from archeological sites. “Here we have the direct evidence right from the humans themselves. So that’s the last nail in the coffin,” said Pedersen. The genetic analysis also shed light on the sex of the mummified individuals, while the position of the nits on the hair revealed that at least some of them experienced very low temperatures at the time that they died. While the approach has limitations – the parasites are unlikely to be found in skeletal remains, for example – the authors said museum collections around the world held rich historical archives of parasites. Pedersen said the work could help shed light on longstanding mysteries. “We know quite a lot about Europe and east Asia currently from ancient genetics, but America still seems to be quite a blank spot on the genomic landscape,” he said. “This is one of the places we really want to try to see if we can get some genetic information about what’s going on in the past, who was there, and also filling in that blank spot.”",News/Science,How nit glue could help answer head-scratchers about our ancestors,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/28/how-nit-glue-could-help-answer-head-scratchers-about-our-ancestors
12/29/2021,"More than 130 years after a time capsule was deposited in the pedestal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee, and after one false start, conservators in Virginia were finally able to open the long sought-after box on Tuesday.  The 36lb copper container, deposited in 1887, was removed on Monday after it was found sitting in water in the remains of the pedestal. In footage of the opening streamed live online from a state laboratory, Katherine Ridgway, Virginia’s archeological conservator, said she was “a little nervous”. But although some of the contents of the time capsule were damp, Ridgway said they were “in pretty good shape, considering”, adding that officials had feared water could have turned the artefacts to “soup”. First, officials found a button, a calling card, handwritten letters, damp copies of the political magazine Harper’s Weekly from 1865, Confederate banknotes and what experts believed to be a fragment from a shell from the battle of Fredericksburg. Then, after sawing sawing an additional section of the box in order to access items that had probably expanded and stuck together, they found a “very wet” Bible with an 1883 silver coin stuck to it, a Richmond directory, a guide to Richmond from 1881 and a Masonic symbol and flag, both carved in wood and wrapped in an envelope. There was also an envelope labelled “badges of army northern Virginia”, several Minie balls (civil war bullets), a yellowed 1887 almanac, a book called “the minutiae of soldier life” containing a bookmark, a newspaper dated 2 January 1883, reports of the chamber of commerce for Richmond from 1886 and 1887 and several rubber bands. The box did not appear to hold a rare and historically significant photo of Abraham Lincoln, taken after the 16th president was assassinated at the end of the civil war in 1865, that had been hoped for. Conservators did find a printed image from Harper’s Weekly showing a figure grieving over Lincoln’s grave. It was the second time in a month that experts opened a time capsule from the Lee pedestal. A box was discovered two weeks ago, generating excitement, but hours of examination suggested it was not the “official” capsule long known about, and was perhaps placed by someone involved with the construction. The discovery of the second capsule completes a long search for the elusive item. Virginia’s governor, Ralph Northam, ordered the enormous equestrian statue of Lee removed in 2020, amid global protests against institutional racism which were sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The statue was not removed until September, after a court cleared the way. News accounts from the late 1800s detailed the placement of the official time capsule in the foundation of the pedestal, and imaging tests appeared to confirm its existence. But a lengthy search during the September statue removal came up empty. Earlier this month, Northam ordered the pedestal removed as well, and crews again started to search. Northam’s office said the box discovered second underwent analysis on Monday. Its dimensions matched the size listed in the historical record and X-rays showed it appeared to include expected items. Records maintained by the Library of Virginia suggest Richmond residents, organisations and businesses contributed about 60 objects to the capsule, including Confederate memorabilia. One line from a newspaper article also listed among the contents “picture of Lincoln lying in his coffin”, stoking years of speculation which ended on Tuesday.
