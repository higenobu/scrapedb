3/11/2022,"The poet laureate, Simon Armitage, has written a poem about the invasion of Ukraine and the pain of displacement, as a mark of solidarity with those under fire. Resistance was written over a few days against a backdrop of harrowing television footage of Ukrainians fleeing bombardment and shooting. Armitage, who was appointed poet laureate in 2019, said: “This is a public role and there are times when I need to respond publicly. The first time that happened was at the beginning of the pandemic. That was one of the most important events in my life, and I felt a responsibility and duty to write something. “Then this great big mess came along, and I feel the same way. My head is full of images and language and ideas, and it’s almost a relief to set things down on paper.” The poem was a “refracted version of what is coming at us in obscene images through the news”. Reports from Ukraine were both compelling and difficult to watch, he said. “I definitely can’t sit through both the 6pm and 10pm news bulletins.” The poem repeats the words “it’s war again” several times, in reference to successive conflicts in recent history. “There’s a weariness in the poem; here we go again,” said Armitage. “But [the poem] is also a form of resistance, I hope. There’s not a lot I can do, sitting here. But writing it down, taking ownership of the terrible images, feels a positive act.” Poetry had an “unbroken relationship with conflict and war, going right back to the Iliad”, said Armitage. He pointed to the famous generation of first world war poets – “the bloggers of their day” – and to Tony Harrison’s poems about more recent wars in the Gulf and Bosnia. While evoking the desperate urgency of escaping death and destruction, Armitage’s poem ends on a note of hope: “An air-raid siren can’t fully mute the cathedral bells.” It was not clear yet whether the world was at a truly pivotal moment, he said. “I was talking to somebody the other day who’d been a young man at the height of the cold war and the Bay of Pigs crisis, and he said he used to go to bed not knowing whether he’d wake up in the morning. “I don’t think we’re quite there yet. But in terms of catastrophe, tragedy, this feels as real and raw as anything I can remember. And the stakes are very high.”",News/World news,Poet laureate Simon Armitage writes Ukraine war poem Resistance,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/poet-laureate-simon-armitage-writes-ukraine-war-poem-resistance
3/11/2022,"Igor Gavrylko was at his home in west London when the Russian bombs began to fall on Ukraine. A British citizen originally from Ukraine, he had lived in the UK since 1996, working most recently for Nissan as a forecourt salesperson. He rang his boss. “I knew a Russian invasion was going to happen,” he said. “My Ukrainian grandfather fought against the Red Army and the Nazis in world war two. Now it’s my turn to help.” Gavrylko set off by car from Ealing and drove across Europe. By the time he arrived in Ukraine his elderly parents had already had a narrow escape. Russian missiles had destroyed the airport in their home town of Ivano-Frankivsk. “My city was bombarded,” he said. Gavrylko arranged for his mother, sister and four-year-old niece to escape to Poland. His 74-year-old father, Boghdan, refused to leave. Now based in the western city of Lviv, Gravrylko is one of thousands of volunteers from around the world who have come to Ukraine to defend the country from Russian attack. Some have Ukrainian roots. Others are military veterans with no family ties who have decided to fight with Ukraine’s army. According to Gavrylko, “several hundred” Britons have already arrived, including Ben Grant, the son of a Tory MP. There are volunteers from Canada – which has a large Ukrainian diaspora community – and the US. A group of Canadians were spotted in Lviv’s Freedom Square this week, with a large Canadian flag on the back of their vehicle. They identified a cafe for breakfast using Google, only to discover it was closed. Others come from the Baltic states and Georgia, itself the victim of Russian aggression and a punitive five-day war in 2008. Collectively, these recruits amount to the most significant international brigade since the Spanish civil war, when volunteers including leftwing intellectuals fought in communist-organised military units between 1936 and 1938 in support of Spain’s popular front government. Gavrylko said he was aware of these historical echoes. Ukraine, in his view, was now fighting Vladimir Putin and a 21st-century version of fascism. “He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union as part of a Russian empire. It’s no secret,” he said. “Ukraine is in the middle of Europe. The west is pulling one way, Moscow another. Ukraine, the Baltic states, Poland and Moldova are all on Putin’s list.” Asked why Putin had attacked Ukraine now, after 20 years in the Kremlin, he said: “I get the feeling he is very ill.” All volunteers sign a contract with Kyiv’s pro-western government. They are then assigned to training groups where their professional experience is evaluated. Gavrylko said he was learning combat first aid. He also worked as an interpreter. “My plan is there is no plan,” he said. Would he willing to fight and die for his native country? “Yes. My grandfather spent 10 years in a Soviet camp in Kazakhstan,” Daniel Kovzhun, a computer engineer in touch with would-be Croatian volunteers, said foreigners made an important contribution to the war effort. “The foreign guys are more capable than civilian Ukrainian volunteers who are joining territorial defence. They already know how to fight.” He added: “They find contacts here very quickly. Some of them are now on the frontline.” Kovzhun pointed out that western military instructors had been training the Ukrainian army since 2014, when Putin annexed Crimea and kickstarted a war in the eastern Donbas region. They included Israelis, Britons and Georgians, he said. Nato refuses to send soldiers to Ukraine. But as Kovzhun noted, many of the volunteers have come from Nato countries to fight Russia. At least four serving British soldiers have disappeared from their barracks and travelled to Ukraine. On Wednesday the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told troops that this was illegal. “You cannot just get up and go,” he said. He described the situation on the ground as dangerous. Ignoring official advice could led to prosecution, he said. On Thursday Boris Johnson said absconding UK service personnel would face a court martial on their return, adding: “You should not go to Ukraine.” According to Reuters, dozens of former soldiers from the British army’s elite Parachute Regiment have reached Ukraine. Hundreds more will soon follow, one ex-soldier predicted. “They’re all highly, highly trained and have seen active service on numerous occasions,” the ex-soldier said. The Ukraine crisis would give them purpose, camaraderie and “a chance to do what they’re good at: fight.” Other countries have taken a more pragmatic view and have waived legal restrictions. Latvia, long an enemy of Russia, has lifted a 2014 ban on its citizens going off to fight with Kyiv. Germany and Canada have taken similar steps. While most volunteers are from North America and Europe, a few have come from countries such as Colombia, Japan and even Jamaica. Meanwhile, Johnson’s decision to deliver defensive weapons to Ukraine has made him a popular figure. The next-generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW) that the UK supplied to Ukraine is now a meme, shared on social media with the union flag and the Beatles, and made into TikTok videos. Since Russia’s invasion it has proved useful on the battlefield. Video shows a missile being fired from the roof of an airport in the city of Mykolaiv. It destroys a Russian tank. Gavrylko, 49, said Johnson had done “an excellent job. I think he is great. He reacted straight away. Some countries took their time.” He said he was prepared to forgive Downing Street for issuing only a handful of visas so far for Ukrainians fleeing the conflict, in contrast to Poland, which has taken in 1 million refugees, and other EU states that have waived visa requirements. “Johnson has promised to rebuild Ukraine after the war,” he said. The Guardian’s request to interview foreign fighters at one of their training bases outside Lviv was turned down. A message from the local commander read: “It’s impossible now.” Understandably the locations are a military secret. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, says more than 66,000 Ukrainians have returned home from abroad to fight – the equivalent of 12 brigades. Such is the demand that the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has launched a website advising would-be volunteers what to do. Those who want to join Ukraine’s international legion are told to report to their nearest Ukrainian embassy for an interview with a defence attache. If successful, they are advised how to get to Ukraine and what to bring: documents, and military kit including body armour and a helmet. More than 16,000 have signed up, the government says. The website features a quote from Zelenskiy: “Anyone who wants to join the defence of security in Europe and the world can come and stand side by side with the Ukrainians against the invaders of the 21st century.” It says Russia’s military operation is not just against Ukraine but the “start of a war against the entire Europe”. The struggle is for “European freedom and democracy”, it says, using the language of western idealism. In Lviv, Gavrylko said he did not know when – or if – he would return to London. “I’ve got no idea if I still have a job,” he admitted. He added: “I’m impressed with the British people’s attitude. Even those miles away from politics understand what is happening here.”",News/World news,‘My plan is there is no plan’: the foreign fighters flocking to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/ukraine-russia-war-foreign-fighters-volunteers
3/11/2022,"This piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian’s climate crisis newsletter. Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday Turning down the thermostat by 1C might not sound like much of a gesture when thousands of people are being killed in Vladimir Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, but it may be one of the few ways by which ordinary people in Europe, and around the world, can make an impact on the horrific events. Europe is highly dependent on Russian gas, which makes up 45% of EU gas imports. And with prices sky-high – partly because of Putin’s actions – an estimated $500m a day is pouring into Russian coffers to fight the Kremlin’s war. If Europe wants to stop Putin, sanctions are needed, but so too are alternative sources of energy. The Ukraine war has starkly revealed a truth that governments failed to learn from throughout the climate crisis: that energy is a matter of national security, and getting off fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable power is a source of strength. Putin tightened the flow of Russian gas to Europe by about a quarter in the months leading up to his invasion, and prices have soared in response. He has used Russia’s dominance of Europe’s gas market as an “economic and political weapon”, the chief of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said last week. The global energy watchdog laid out a 10-point proposal showing how Europe could reduce its consumption of Russian gas by about a third, including advice to consumers to turn down their thermostats by only 1C, from an average of 22C to an average of 21C – a level that maintains comfort and that most people will barely notice, but which will save about 10bn cubic metres out of the 155bn imported annually from Russia. Other measures could save more: ramping up renewable energy; insulating homes; a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies that have enjoyed a bonanza amid high energy prices, with the proceeds used to reduce bills for hard-pressed consumers; and delaying the planned closure of several nuclear power stations. All these are likely to be needed, and more. There is a serious danger, too, that governments will seek return to the coal-fired power stations they were phasing out – though they should note that about half of the coal used in the EU is imported from Russia. European countries are now re-evaluating their energy systems as a matter of urgency, and the results will help determine how the bloc tackles the climate crisis. Ironically, amid all this: Russia, if it wanted, could make a massive difference to the climate crisis, and at no cost. The IEA also found, in a separate report, that Russia is one of the biggest emitters of methane, the main component of natural gas, through its ageing and poorly constructed fossil fuel production infrastructure. Simply plugging those leaks – which would be profitable, because more gas could then be sold – could go a long way to help reduce temperature rises by 0.2C in the 2040s. But a country willing to slaughter today’s children with bombs and bullets is unlikely to balk at killing tomorrow’s through climate breakdown.",News/Environment,Can turning down our radiators turn up the heat on Vladimir Putin?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/down-to-earth-radiators-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine
3/11/2022,"Boris Johnson is getting serious about Ukraine. He may not admit many Ukrainian refugees lest they endanger the Conservatives’ claim to being the party of low migration. But he is slamming sanctions on seven more London oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich, Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska. The high-profile trio, with four other oligarchs, are eerily accused of “enabling the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies”. Abramovich’s Chelsea football club is to be “frozen” and banned from selling tickets. That should teach Chelsea fans a lesson about who to support, and is meant to make Vladimir Putin shake in his shoes. War is simple. You fight. You kill. You win or you lose. Economic war, on the other hand, is a mess of signals, boycotts, ill-defined targets and indiscriminate victims. Because it is bloodless, it is somehow detached from whatever issue is at hand. Almost invariably the real sufferers are the poor and impotent. As for Abramovich, what is he supposed to do? The likelihood of his going to Moscow and persuading his chum that the invasion of Ukraine was a terrible mistake must be zero. This is foreign policy as pure theatre. Ukraine has summoned the west to collective action. The current surge in sanctions has generated a hysteria of Russia-hating gestures by western countries. This has clearly been aimed at relieving their justified reluctance to join or widen the Ukrainian war. The unity of the damnation has been impressive, even if the effectiveness has not. For all the shared condemnation, two weeks of truly colossal financial and commercial disruption have yet to deliver the slightest shift in Putin’s strategy; indeed, sanctions may have even hardened his lethal resolve. Quite apart from Britain’s shocking aversion to refugees, its barrage of measures seem devoid of direction. Decades of profitable investment in Russia’s economy are somehow to end overnight. The chief effect could well be to repatriate billions of pounds of wealth – as in the case of BP and Shell – to the very oligarchs such actions are supposed to punish. Russia is now proposing to seize and nationalise closed western factories and other western activities, free of charge. As Russian oil and gas will soon soar in value, Johnson’s decision to enforce sanctions may end up penalising British citizens with even higher energy bills. Who suffers and who gains by forecourt petrol hitting £2 a litre? The Saudis, the Iranians, the Venezuelans and eventually the Russians will laugh all the way to the bank. By banning Russian fertiliser exports, Johnson will punish British farmers. By banning wheat exports he will punish their chief consumers. Meanwhile, Johnson wants to resume British gas fracking and permit the proliferation of onshore wind turbines. Everyone cheers the “tough” gesture. No one ponders its usefulness. Measures understandable in the heat of battle come to seem pointless and heartless far from the front. Nothing is gained by requiring Russian artists, performers and sports figures on pain of expulsion to denounce their homeland – risking the safety of their families in Russia. There are calls to strip private schools of charitable status if they take Russian pupils. The Welsh may not listen to the Russian Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture, appropriately to be replaced by Elgar’s Enigma Variations. In the ultimate obscenity, HM Revenue and Customs this week told British people not to send relief supplies to Ukraine as the trucks were being held at Calais for the correct Brexit permits in order to enter the EU. We should just give money instead. Why did Johnson not tell us in 2016 that leaving the single market would obstruct relief sent to victims of war? Little of the news coming out of Russia is reliable. Still, Russia’s instinctive nationalism appears to be rallying to its leader’s cause, as tends to happen in war. Polls that have been registering Putin’s ailing popularity have shown it surging to near 70%. Of course this is aided by a savagely censored media and mendacious publicity machine. But it is no good blaming this for the ineffectiveness of sanctions. Such nationalism is predictable in war and was what sanctions had to overcome to have any impact. Would it now really help the Ukrainian cause if all Apple and Android servers stopped working, as some have demanded? This appalling war is unlike most in Europe’s history in that it appears to be the will literally of one man rather than an entire country. None of Putin’s top brass are thought to have known of or supported it. Sheer terror now keeps them loyal. Yet no expert is predicting an early coup or assassination – let alone a new boyars’ plot of oligarchs sweeping into the Kremlin in gold-plated helicopters. Somehow or other, mediation is going to have to disentangle this horror on terms vaguely acceptable to Putin. Then it will be in no one’s interest for the punitive ostracism of Russia to continue a moment longer, on the spurious grounds that ordinary Russians somehow “allowed” Putin to invade Ukraine. Punishing losers is a counter-productive outcome of war. It’s worth remembering the economic devastation and humiliation of Germany after 1918, or Russia after 1989. Ukraine will have to rebuild. So too will Russia. This is not kindness, just common sense.

3/11/2022,"My earliest reading memoryI was six years old, and sitting in class, as the teacher ground through each sentence of our class primer. I was so frustrated by how slow it was that I started reading ahead to myself, silently. I remember being stunned when I turned the last page. It felt like magic. I had started the day not reading at all, and ended it reading a whole book. My favourite book growing upThe James Herriot books. I was originally drawn to them because I loved animals. I read them starting at age 10, over and over, despite – or maybe because of – the fact that I lived in a very different world from Herriot’s (modern-day New York City, with zero access to farm animals). I loved his warmth and self-deprecation. He made me want to be just like him: a veterinarian writer. Then I realised it was actually just the writing part I wanted. The book that changed me as a teenagerI had so many positive formative reading experiences as a teenager. But one that stands out was actually a negative experience: reading The Fountainhead. At 15, I often chose books based on how thick they were – the thicker the better. And Ayn Rand’s doorstoppers were everywhere, so I picked one, and started reading. For maybe the first 50 pages, I was hooked by the story. But I began to feel a sort of visceral disgust – as if I were being submerged into a tub of slime. I realised that I hated the book – not the writing, but the ideas behind it. Before this I’d always read with an open heart. I saw authors as thoughtful and benevolent authorities. If it was written in a book, I thought, it must be true. The Fountainhead was my awakening about how crucial it is to read critically. The writer who changed my mindThe Christians As the Romans Saw Them, by Robert Wilken. I read it when I was 20, for a college course, and it completely changed the way I thought about the early days of Christianity, turning inside out much of what I’d been taught as a child. It was a thrilling revelation, and I ended up becoming passionately interested in the intersection of the Roman world and Christianity. Also, TS Eliot’s The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock. I read it first at 16. Before that, poems were largely irrelevant to me, either comic limericks or formal sonnets. But Prufrock changed all that: it was angsty love at first sight. I dove head-first into poetry and never looked back. The book that made me want to be a writerAs I entered my teen years, Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club, and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. Both were a revelation in terms of how language could be used, how stories could be told – and what kinds of stories were worth telling. I remember hoping to one day write a novel that could have even a tenth of the power of those books. The book or author I came back toThings Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. I read it for school when I was 15. I enjoyed it, but wasn’t equipped to understand it in the least. I just reread it this past year, and was overwhelmed by how gripping it is, and what a work of subversive genius. The book I rereadEdward Gorey’s The Unstrung Harp: Or, Mr Earbrass Writes a Novel. The first time I read the hilarious story of Mr Earbrass’s creative travails, I was 13, and I loved how funny and strange the book was. Once I started writing more seriously, I appreciated its satirical insightfulness into the writing journey. I have come back to Mr Earbrass often over the years: for a creative roadmap, for reassurance and, most of all, for laughs. The book I could never read againSo many of the fantasy novels that I inhaled as a child. The women were scarcely even two-dimensional, it was always the same old Chosen One plot, and in retrospect, many of them also featured racist tropes. It was a pleasure to discover Octavia Butler as an older reader, I wish I had known about her then. Ditto The Hero and the Crown by Robin McKinley, and The Tombs of Atuan by Ursula K LeGuin. The book I discovered later in lifeGreat Expectations by Charles Dickens. By some accident, I never got assigned Dickens in school, and never picked him up on my own. Decades later, I began seeing that authors I loved had enjoyed reading him – in particular Min Jin Lee and Sarah Waters. So I decided it was time to catch up. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and am eyeing Bleak House next. The book I am currently readingThe Secret Lives of Church Ladies by Deesha Philyaw. It’s terrific. I’m savouring every story in it, reading them once, then again. My comfort readWatership Down by Richard Adams. It’s wonderfully epic, the characters feel like old friends, and I love the heart-pounding ending. In a totally different way, I also love rereading Julie Otsuka’s The Buddha in the Attic. It’s an incredibly powerful novel, with the lyrical intensity of a poem. It reminds me of what books can do at their best.  Galatea by Madeline Miller is published by Bloomsbury (£6.99).

3/11/2022,"There is not one disgruntled wife in this high-concept reworking of Henrik Ibsen’s incendiary play but three Noras, situated in different time-frames across a century: 1918, 1968 and 2018. It is a bold idea, slightly reminiscent of The Hours, and it re-plants the drama in symbolic, surreal and non-naturalistic ground, asking what has changed for Nora – and middle-class women like her – since she first slammed the door on her marriage. The trouble is that the clever concept in Stef Smith’s script bears down heavily in its enactment and the theatrical challenges get in the way of its power. Directed by Bryony Shanahan, the three leads, Kirsty Rider in 1918, Jodie McNee in 1968 and Yusra Warsama in 2018, give committed performances, switching between monologue and dialogue, and also alternating deftly between playing Nora and her friend, Christine, in the bat of an eye. But there are not enough tonal differences between them, or even enough visual signposts beyond their dresses (Rider is in a gown, McNee in a short skirt and Warsama in contemporary clothes). Neither are there distinct enough cultural references to give them specificity, so they do not come across as women of different eras but as alter egos, of sorts. The Nora of 1918 speaks about the joy of casting her first vote while her 1968 counterpart discusses abortion, the pill and her equivocal relationship to motherhood. The last of these is particularly interesting as she talks of the sequestering of her body and her disconnected feelings towards her three children (who are always absent) – but it is brisk and under-explored as a theme. They speak like an ancient Greek chorus at times, chanting in unison, their words reaching towards poetry that is sometimes overwrought. It creates melodrama but brings distance, too, taking the Noras further into the realm of archetype or totem rather than flesh and blood. Amanda Stoodley’s set adds to the sense of symbolic realities, made up of three squares, not quite aligned, with string holding it in place. The script, with its tricksiness, sounds stilted in the mouths of some actors too, especially the sketchy male parts. Nora’s husband, Thomas (William Ash), is the ultimate archetype, unchanging over the centuries, in the same suit, and both patronising and patrician in his attitude to his wife. This presentation makes the point that men’s power in the home has stayed intact over the past 100 years but it also feels reductive. As a result, Thomas’s character is too flat to appear credible. Nathan (Andrew Sheridan), as the blackmailing widower, is a much more interesting figure, not demonised but shown as another victim of the system, even if Sheridan channels shouty anger above more textured emotions. The family friend, Daniel (Naeem Hayat), meanwhile, appears like little more than a function of the plot, and his terminal diagnosis does not have a strong enough emotional effect on Nora. Instead it brings about a scene in 2018 in which she allows him to touch her calf, which seems incredibly dated for its sexual coyness. A lesbian kiss between Nora and Christine is under-investigated for its emotional ripples. There is no slamming door at the end but three different outcomes, which have their power, but just don’t leave us feeling enough.

3/11/2022,"After a dizzying rise from student protest leader to head of state in just over a decade, Gabriel Boric is set to be sworn in on Friday as Chile’s youngest ever president. A month on from his 36th birthday, Boric will be flanked by several of the student leaders who served alongside him through two terms in congress and are now joining his cabinet. “This is the best generation of young politicians Chile has had in 50 years,” says Luis Maira, 81, a former minister who was a mentor for the new president. “Without a shadow of a doubt, Boric is leading us into a new chapter of Chilean history.” Chile was rocked by months of unrest in 2019 over inequality, corruption and inadequate social welfare. Many of the protesters’ demands echoed those which Boric and his contemporaries had pushed in a student movement which demanded that Chile be rebuilt with the concerns of its people at the core. It is a vision that Boric has vowed to achieve as president – although a divided congress will probably hamper progress. In the background, representatives from every corner of Chile are drafting a new constitution to replace Gen Augusto Pinochet’s 1980 charter. The new constitution will be put to a referendum later this year. The new government will also have to negotiate heightened tensions between the state and indigenous Mapuche in the south, and a migration crisis in the north. Boric makes a point of insisting that history does not begin with his generation, but there is no denying their impact on politics. “He always wanted to know where those who held power came from and what they had done before,” said Maira. In the winter of 2011, Boric and his contemporaries paralysed Santiago with their movement targeting free, high-quality education for all, catapulting them into the national consciousness. A year later, Boric took the reins at the University of Chile’s student union in the centre of the capital, where bright swirls of colour now adorn a building once occupied by Pinochet’s feared secret police. “He always had something about him, and when he put himself forward for congress I joked that he might become president,” remembered Sonia Moreno, 59, who has worked at the union for over a decade. As she flicked through pictures of her and a long-haired Boric on her phone, she recalled how he pushed her to finish her schooling and even helped raise money for an operation on her arm. “I have so much faith in him because he’s a warrior – he does what he says. He has a strong character and he’s determined,” she said. In 2013, Boric was elected to Chile’s congress representing Magallanes, Chile’s southernmost region, vowing to change Chile from the bottom up. Those around him paint a picture of a voracious reader and patient negotiator, determined to collect opinions, bridge political divisions and build majorities. Boric has repeatedly said that as part of his ambition to decentralise Chile, he hopes to leave the presidency with less power than when he inherited it. He has also been careful to signpost the changing of the times with his early choices. Boric reiterated his backing for Chile’s constitutional process the morning after the election, and last month announced a female-majority cabinet – a symbol of the feminist Chile he is looking to build. He will live downtown in Barrio Yungay, where eclectic rows of low-rise homes and graffitied facades line cobbled streets – a far cry from the outgoing president, the billionaire Sebastián Piñera, who has a large house in Santiago’s affluent north-eastern suburbs. The home Boric has chosen sits between streets named Freedom and Hope. “If Boric is able to oversee the transition from one constitution to another, and from one generation to the next, then I would consider that a success,” said Maira. “If he can do that, then the effects will be felt across Latin America, as he could be remembered as the leader of a new era in a region that has rarely found consensus.”",News/World news,"Gabriel Boric, 36, to usher in new era for Chile as he takes presidential oath",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/gabriel-boric-chile-president-new-era

3/11/2022,"The 10-strong board of directors of Evraz, the steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich controls a 29% stake, have resigned after sanctions were imposed on the Russian oligarch and shares in the company were suspended. On Friday, the company said its 10 remaining non-executive directors – which include the former Ford executive Stephen Odell and Sir Michael Peat, a former private secretary to Prince Charles and whose family name is the p in KPMG – have now all resigned. Two of the directors – Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov – are major Evraz shareholders alongside Abramovich. It followed the move by the UK government on Thursday to sanction Abramovich, with ministers accusing him of having “clear connections” to Vladimir Putin’s regime, and the suspension of Evraz’s shares on the London Stock Exchange. Abramovich’s UK assets have been frozen, meaning he cannot sell his stake in the steel and coal company. The company said on Friday: “Evraz is deeply concerned and saddened by the Ukraine-Russia conflict and hopes that a peaceful resolution will be found soon. “In light of the financial sanctions notice issued by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, HM Treasury, on 10 March 2022 and the suspension of the company’s shares from trading, all the Evraz plc non-executive directors have resigned as directors with immediate effect. Alexey Ivanov, the company’s chief executive, will continue as a director.” Last week, James Rutherford resigned as a director of Evraz after only nine months on the board, a day after the Institute of Directors urged British nationals to quit Russian boards, saying it was “no longer tenable” for them to remain after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The official government sanctions announcement on Thursday also claimed that Abramovich effectively controls the company, that it may have made steel for Russian tanks and that it supplied goods and services to the Russian government that could contribute to the invasion of Ukraine. Evraz denied the claims and said it did not expect the company itself to be hit with sanctions. Abramovich did not have “effective control” of the company, it said in a statement to the stock market, highlighting that he owned less than 50% and could appoint only three of 11 board members. “In view of the aforesaid, the company considers that the UK financial sanctions shall not apply to the company itself,” it said. Evraz denied its steel was used to build Russian tanks, saying it provided steel only to the “infrastructure and construction sectors”. The company also denied “that it is or has been involved in providing financial services, or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine – which includes potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks.” On Wednesday, Evraz had distanced itself from Abramovich and two other directors, as well as cancelling a shareholder payout that would have been worth $210m (£160m) to the Chelsea FC owner.",News/Business,Evraz board resigns after sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/11/evraz-board-resigns-after-sanctions-imposed-on-roman-abramovich
3/11/2022,"Doing your washing up straight away is just common sense – and much more hygienic We don’t have a dishwasher in our flat, so the washing up became an issue pretty quickly. Jakiyah and I have lived together for two years – we met through mutual friends at university. I prefer the washing up to be done straight away, but Jakiyah is a “worry about it later” type of person. If she’s in a rush in the morning, she will leave a bowl with bits of porridge in it soaking in the sink all day, sometimes for several days. After a big dinner, Jakiyah rarely washes up straight away. There have also been times when she’s chopped raw meat and not cleaned the knives and boards immediately after. If you leave dirty dishes in the sink, they can get very grim very quickly and become a breeding ground for germs. Jakiyah thinks I’m a clean freak, but to me washing up straight away is just common sense. If you leave dishes soaking for days, then have to stick your hand in the sink to clean them or pull the plug, you are going to get germs on your hands. One Friday, I was working from home and Jakiyah was heading to the gym. She made an elaborate breakfast and then left all the pans in the sink. Then she came back with a friend that night and cooked a curry, and left those pans in there, too. On Saturday she must have cooked something else as by Sunday there was a mountain of unwashed dishes in the sink. I said, “This is gross, why did you let it build up?” She told me it wasn’t a big deal, but I was annoyed. My cooking had to wait while she cleaned everything. It was very inconsiderate. We do get along well, but with housework I am tidier. I try to design a schedule. We split the chores. I can try and be a bit more relaxed with other chores, but not with the washing up. I work from home so I notice when things aren’t done. We are both busy women, but it would be nice if I didn’t have to ask Jakiyah not to let dirty dishes pile up. We are in our mid-20s, we aren’t students any more. I do most of the cooking, so it’s not unfair that I sometimes leave the dishes if I’m in a rush There are two types of people in this world: those who stress over menial chores, and those who don’t. I fall into the latter category. If I’m in a rush I will leave out my dishes for a day or two and I don’t see anything wrong with that. There are simply not enough hours in the day to tidy as you go when cooking. I don’t buy this idea that one bowl is a breeding ground for germs that could make you sick – that’s very over the top. If I’m chopping raw meat I will wash up the chopping board immediately. Other than that, I think it’s fine to leave things. In the mornings I’m in a rush to get out the door, so it makes sense to soak my bowl after I’ve had my porridge. It’s also easier to clean after a few hours’ soaking. On that weekend when the dishes piled up, I was out and about. The washing up was the last thing on my mind. I did it on Sunday and Anita had plenty of time to use the kitchen after me. It wasn’t a big deal. I usually do most of the cooking in the flat, so it’s only fair that Anita does a little more of the washing up. She enjoys the dishes I make because they are elaborate. Using all the pots, pans and utensils to make a meal is a sign of a good chef. If I was cooking basic food, she wouldn’t like that either. I think a lot of it is down to the fact that she works from home, whereas I go to an office. She spends most of her day inside and so naturally she notices the little things when I’m not there. I try to stick to her cleaning schedule, but when it comes to the washing up, she needs to relax. Anita and I generally get on well, but it’s irritating when we argue over this very small issue. I have tried to be better and wash up immediately, but I can’t always manage it. And Anita will bring up the fact that I’ve left one mug, a spoon and a bowl in the sink if it’s been there for more than a day. It’s a bit ridiculous. There’s more to life than washing up. Should Jakiyah wash up straight away? It sounds like Jakiyah watched the first 10 minutes of Withnail and I and decided the pair offered good lifestyle tips. If she were to drink a cup of tea in the last clean mug, put it on pile of her dirty pots and pans and stroll to the bathroom, only to find Anita was soaking a lot of dirty laundry in the sink, wouldn’t she think it was a bit selfish?David, 63 Anita’s demands really aren’t extreme. A dirty environment is counterproductive. Jakiyah should invest in a dishwasher, or compromise – perhaps by using less equipment. This “menial chore” isn’t going away any time soon.Rosey, 28 Jakiyah – nice try, but you know what’s even easier to clean than a soaked porridge bowl? Yes, one that is rinsed straight away! It takes two seconds. And leaving things lurking in the sink for days on end is just plain unpleasant.Janet, 55 In our house, if you cook you wash up – then you’re more aware of the mess you make. Jakiyah needs to be more respectful of the kitchen as a shared space, especially if she knows it winds Anita up. (Although porridge bowls aren’t a breeding ground for germs, Anita. They just go a bit grey and slimy.)James, 29 Disagreements about chores are common, but how well has Anita communicated her discontent? Has there even been a discussion? Has Anita only moaned? Setting time aside time for a frank discussion may go some way to resolving the issue.Catherine, 43 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Jakiyah stop letting the dirty dishes pile up?

3/11/2022,"Perhaps the most splendid payoff from Matt Reeves’ The Batman is that it has the potential for opening up an entire Batverse of movies and TV shows. This is a movie that resets the dark knight mythos in the same way Batman Begins did in 2005 after the debacle that was Batman & Robin. For long-term fans of the caped crusader, it’s like a warm bath in all that Gotham City good stuff, with the implication that more mysteries lurk around every corner for Batman as he cuts through corrupt cops and hardboiled gangsters. So what comes next? We already know that Colin Farrell’s remarkable, unrecognisable turn as Oswald Cobblepot is to be rewarded with a spin-off TV show that will screen on HBO Max in the US. And there are also rumours that Arkham Asylum, which by the end of Reeves’ movie has been revealed as the new home of not just Paul Dano’s Riddler but also Barry Keoghan’s Joker, will form the basis of a second segue to the small screen. It’s more than possible Robert Pattinson’s Batman might turn up from time to time in either, but both shows will have to find storylines that swirl far beyond his immediate sphere of influence. The Batman ends with the Joker and the Riddler at the apparent beginning of a poisonous friendship, a development that could drive the proposed Arkham Asylum series forward if Warner Bros decides to borrow from the storyline of the classic comic book War of Jokes and Riddles. But what about The Bat’s next big-screen outing? Reeves has already gone on record to say that any sequel will most likely feature a different supervillain and that the climactic reveal should not be read as a Marvel-style setup up for future episodes (though Christopher Nolan pulled a similar trick in Batman Begins and did go on to give us the definitive Batman/Joker film). But it tallies with the sense that Reeves is ploughing his own unorthodox furrow with Gotham’s favourite son. Moreover, if the deliciously languid pace of The Batman is to be echoed in future instalments, Reeves needs to retain the air of foreboding and enigma that allowed Battinson to slip into “world’s greatest detective” mode. Dano’s brutal Riddler was the perfect foil, but other villains who employ subterfuge and sleight of hand, such as Hush or Ra’s Al Ghul, might fit the new template more comfortably thanmore physical enemies such as Bane. Reeves has suggested that Hush is in his thoughts, though not necessarily for The Batman’s sequel. And there are even hints in his film that Thomas Elliot, who has ready-made connections to the Riddler and Catwoman, could already be present in this arty and unhurried take on Gotham City. Then again, so could any of the caped crusader’s traditional rogue’s gallery of supervillains. That’s the beauty of The Batman and its vision of Gotham City as an enormous, spiky puzzle waiting to be solved. We’re right at the beginning of this epic comic book conundrum, and there’s no knowing which dark and dastardly players are biding their time for the later, ever-more lucrative climactic rounds.",Arts/Film,The Batman reinvented Gotham.

3/11/2022,"Few people can keep up with US rap phenomenon Megan Thee Stallion, let alone upstage her. But Lick – her recent collaboration with Jamaican dancehall artist Shenseea – proves it is at least possible. That’s partly thanks to the latter’s imperious, hypnotically rhythmic flow, but also because of the things she says. Lick is an ode to receiving oral sex, and Shenseea pays tribute in eye-wateringly blunt style (sample lyric: “Me want me pum-pum sucked, sucked, sucked”). It’s a theme that continues throughout the 25-year-old’s debut album: even taking into account dancehall’s sexually explicit lyrical tradition, Shenseea is staggeringly profane. Sometimes this is pushed to the point of unintentional comedy (the sweetly romantic slow jam Deserve It somehow manages to find room for the line “put that pussy in a hearse every time”) but usually it feels like a suitable accompaniment to the uninhibited, thundering energy of her music. Shenseea also knows how to entertain a guest, pairing a raft of stars with dancehall tunes subtly altered in their favour. Beenie Man shines on Henkel Glue, a blistering, old-school take on the genre; 21 Savage’s tightly controlled mumblings slot nicely into the serpentine R&B-fusion of R U That; Offset appears on the trap-adjacent Bouncy. In fact, the musician works so well with others that the final stretch of solo numbers drags slightly in comparison. Yet by the album’s conclusion, you can’t help but feel you’re in the presence of Jamaican dancehall’s next big crossover star: a woman with the ability to cover all bases without ever watering down her distinctive – and unabashedly risque – presence.",Arts/Music,"Shenseea: Alpha review – thundering energy, staggering profanity",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/11/shenseea-alpha-review-album-dancehall
