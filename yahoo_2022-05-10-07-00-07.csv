5/10/2022,"A long-haul truck driver was arrested Saturday night on suspicion of raping a clerk at the motel he was staying at in Turlock. The incident occurred around 8:25 p.m. at the Days Inn on North Tully Road, said Turlock police Lt. Neil Cervenka. The suspect, 29-year-old Osman Mukhammadiyev, called the front desk to report an “equipment problem” in his room. A female employee responded to the room, where Mukhammadiyev allegedly restrained her and sexually assaulted her, Cervenka said. He said the victim was able to fight off the suspect, run back to the hotel office and call 911. Cervenka said officers quickly arrived at the scene and apprehended Mukhammadiyev as he was coming out of his room. He was arrested on suspicion of forcible rape, kidnapping to commit rape and false imprisonment. His bail is set at $670,000 and he has not yet been formally charged. A woman at the Days Inn who identified herself as the assistant manager declined to comment about the incident when contacted by The Bee on Monday. Cervenka said Mukhammadiyev is a long-haul trucker from Massachusetts who’d been staying at the motel for a few days. “We don’t know if he has ever been in this area before; we have no history at all with him,” the lieutenant said. “Investigators have a concern that this may have happened in other areas or states due the the nature of his job and the nature of the offense,” Cervenka said. “We urge anyone with information to come forward.” Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Tony Argueta at 209-668-6538.",U.S./Modesto Bee,Turlock hotel clerk allegedly raped by guest who reported equipment issue in his room,https://news.yahoo.com/turlock-hotel-clerk-allegedly-raped-194600857.html
5/10/2022,"The West has hit Russia with a range of economic sanctions including a promise this weekend from the G-7 nations to reduce their dependence on the country's oil. But one type of sanction, so-called ""export controls,"" has attracted less attention than other high-profile penalties like seizing oligarchs' yachts. Export controls ban companies from sending crucial products like semiconductors to Russia with the goal of gradually starving its economy. But a top Biden administration official told Yahoo Finance on Monday that certain export controls may hurt Vladimir Putin’s army in the immediate future. “Because of the export controls we’ve already put in place, Russia’s top two manufacturers of tanks are no longer in business,” Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said Monday. “Russia today has far fewer tanks than they had going into this invasion, and they can't make more because of the action that we're taking with sanctions.” The White House says the controls have left Russia’s two major tank plants — the Uralvagonzavod Corporation and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant — idle due to a lack of foreign components. And observers noticed fewer tanks than normal at the annual military parade on Moscow’s Red Square on Monday. Meanwhile, images of destroyed Russian tanks felled by U.S.-made Javelin missiles have become a rallying cry for Ukrainians and their allies. On Sunday, the White House announced additional export controls on items like wood products, industrial engines, bulldozers, and more to “further limit Russia’s access to items and revenue that could support its military capabilities.” The EU moved in tandem with new controls on items like chemicals. A senior administration official told reporters over the weekend that export control efforts had begun on specialized products like microchips and now “we’re broadening into industrial products that have a similar effect, we think, on Putin’s ability to prosecute his war ambitions.” As Adeyemo told Yahoo Finance on Monday, the goal is to ""reduce the resources to Russia in order to make sure they have less resources to fight their war on Ukraine."" The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) as laid out in U.S. government documents apply not just to items produced in the U.S. but also claims “foreign-produced items located outside the United States are subject to the EAR when they are a ‘direct product’ of” industries like U.S. technology, software, or manufacturing."" The moves on export controls come as part of a host of new actions against Russia announced Sunday, including sanctions against Russian individuals and businesses and an attempt by G7 nations to stop importing Russian oil. The U.S. Commerce Department also said Monday that the U.S. would temporarily suspend tariffs on Ukrainian steel for one year.
