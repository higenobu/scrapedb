5/4/2022,"Her eponymous programme pulls in well over a million daytime TV viewers, while Lorraine Kelly herself is so famous her chatshow persona has been declared a separate entity for tax purposes. But with Ukraine, the cost of living and his own political survival to think about, Boris Johnson should be excused for not instantly recognising her name, Downing Street has argued. An already bruising Tuesday morning interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain became more alarming still for Johnson’s media minders when he professed ignorance of the fact Kelly’s show was about to start. After his interviewer, Susanna Reid, referred to the show beginning immediately afterwards, Johnson replied: “Who’s Lorraine?” Reid responded with evident surprise: “Who’s Lorraine? Lorraine is a legend.” Asked whether Johnson knew who Kelly was, his official spokesperson said it was less a case of complete ignorance about one of the UK’s better-known TV faces, and more about the prime minister being too busy to realise her show was coming next. “I think, as was clear, the prime minister was not fully across the ITV daytime lineup this morning,” the spokesperson said. “But you’ll appreciate he has a number of issues to deal with on his desk.” In 2019, a tribunal judge hearing a long-running case in which Kelly appealed against a £1.2m tax and national insurance bill from HMRC agreed it was legitimate for the presenter to be considered a theatrical artist, meaning payments to an agent were a tax deductible expense. Rather than being herself, Kelly performs the role “of a friendly, chatty and fun personality”, which amounts to a separate persona, the judge said. Kelly did not comment on Johnson’s apparent lack of knowledge about the timing of her long-running show, saying only: “Wow, thank you Susanna, a masterclass in a political interview, excellent stuff.” The grilling had focused strongly on the cost of living, with Johnson accepting his government had not done enough to alleviate the pain of the cost of living crisis “I accept that those contributions from the taxpayer, because that’s what it is – taxpayers’ money – isn’t going to be enough immediately to help cover everybody,” he said. “There is more that we can do but the crucial thing is to make sure we deal with the prices over the medium and long term.”",News/Politics,No 10 points to PM’s busy schedule as reason for Lorraine Kelly gaffe,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/03/boris-johson-gmb-lorraine-kelly-gaffe
5/4/2022,"Just Stop Oil has taken action in Scotland for the first time, with more than 50 activists blockading an oil terminal in Glasgow. Shortly before sunrise on Tuesday, about 40 supporters of the civil resistance campaign against fossil fuel production blocked the entrance to the Nustar Clydebank terminal, locking themselves together and climbing on tankers. Fourteen more activists made their way inside, with three scaling a storage silo and the rest climbing into pipework distributing fuel around the site, halting operations. The action marks a shift in strategy for the group, which had previously targeted oil terminals, tankers and petrol stations in the Midlands and south-east England in an effort to disrupt the oil supply to London. Just Stop Oil, which is calling for the government to promise a moratorium on new fossil fuel projects, said the action was prompted by plans for new oil and gas fields in the North Sea, off Scotland’s coast. Among those taking part was Neil Rothnie, 69, a retired oil and gas worker, who said: “North Sea oil and gas does not offer energy security. The North Sea oil and gas industry has one priority and it is not the climate crisis, it’s not the future of North Sea oil and gas workers, and it’s certainly not whether the poor can stay warm. “If the government was serious about a just transition we would be seeing it here in Scotland. Where are the turbine factories in Scotland? Where are the yards building platforms for offshore wind? Where are the projects to properly insulate our houses? When will we get free public transport?” Supporters of Just Stop Oil have been arrested more than 1,200 times since the campaign began at the beginning of April. They have vowed to continue disrupting UK fuel infrastructure until their demands are met.",News/Environment,Just Stop Oil blockades terminal in Glasgow in first Scottish action,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/03/just-stop-oil-blockades-terminal-in-glasgow-in-first-scottish-action
5/4/2022,"With the summer hiatus fast approaching, the time is ripe to declare the winners and losers of the 2021-22 US TV season, and the most straightforward success story is that of Abbott Elementary. Creator-star Quinta Brunson’s comedy set at an underfunded Philadelphia public school has a breakout favorite in Janelle James as foot-mouthed principal Ava, a locked-in order for a second season, and a genuine grassroots fandom that’s translated to respectable ratings for a network show in this day and age. What’s more, the freshman series has emerged as the new standard-bearer for its genre at a time when the classical half-hour sitcom has been left on life support, its specimens dwindling as eyeballs drift to the unstructured time-suck of streaming content. It’s that prominent placement in the perennial conversation about Where TV Comedy Is At Right Now which makes Abbott Elementary’s peculiar structuring absences all the more noticeable and edifying. Frequently enough to be impossible to ignore, the show’s writing leaves its viewer waiting for a comedic beat that never comes, or just doesn’t scan. In episode seven, Brunson’s upbeat teacher Janine faces a tough choice between doing her job and impressing her hipster friend who’s come to teach art at Abbott. Wise senior teacher Melissa commends Janine on her responsible decision-making by telling her, “Being a real person is more important than being cool, and you’re a real person, who owes me seventy-five copies of Peter Rabbit before next year.” They hug, and even with that last phrase tacked on to put some edge on the moment, a passing Ava isn’t wrong when she rolls her eyes at the “very special episode” playing out in front of her. There are plenty of instances along these lines, wherein the almighty imperative to get the laugh is back-burnered in favor of the goopily earnest or morally instructive – and that’s the key to its popularity. Abbott’s fridge-magnet messaging aligns it with a recent spike in good cheer that’s overtaken the mainest parts of the mainstream. As the touchy-feely Coda dueled with the somewhat stoic Power of the Dog for Best Picture at the Oscars in March, industry pundits boiled the choice down to a question of the sweet vs. the steely. Likewise, Apple’s golden child Ted Lasso cleaned up at the Emmys on a wave of crowd-pleasing underdog optimism. Indie action bonanza Everything Everywhere All At Once is currently inching toward sleeper-hit status as its box office holds week by week, supported by waves of viewers breathlessly tweeting about its pleas to reject nihilism and embrace love. As much as these varied titles are linked by the warm temperament of the texts themselves, their most significant commonality lies in how they’re received and discussed. As a reasonably enjoyable way to spend anywhere from thirty minutes to two and a half hours, this canon represents no great menace unto itself, and yet its reception is still symptomatic of a proliferating, worrisome tendency to celebrate nice things simply for being nice. It doesn’t take much squinting to see why stocks in kindness have risen in the recent past, with Americans demoralized by the stressors of Trumpism, the pandemic, the Masked Singer’s broadcast run, et al. While the impulse to unwind at the end of a long, exhausting workday with something undemanding and comforting is eminently understandable, that’s seldom the rationale given by those within this viewing bloc. If social media is any indication, being pure of heart puts works of niceness beyond the reproach of other criticisms in the estimation of the fans. (And the unsavory corollary to that idea sees some of these viewers extend that same privilege to themselves, as if positioning themselves on the correct, ethical side of a hazily defined culture war fought to determine who has bad politics.) The major entries of the movement collected under the neologism “nicecore” have legions of supporters willing to dive in front of any ill word directed at their fave, and to do this in aggrieved, aggressive terms unbefitting the good vibes they so vocally defend (a now-deleted semi-viral tweet claimed anyone who didn’t like Coda was “an empty, empty person”. This niceness is ultimately used as a cudgel, proof that anyone resistant to it is a joyless misanthrope who’d rather curl up with Come and See. (Or, uh, Tarantino.) On the Community episode taking the piss from Glee, one of the TV medium’s great feats of auto-critique, a diehard asks of a non-believer, “How can you hate Glee? It literally means ‘glee’!” Those unresponsive to salvos of positivism are coldhearted snobs; those uninterested in watching at all are bad sports. There’s a sour irony to watching as dozens of strangers championing the virtues of goodwill chew you out in language generally reserved for baseball game bleachers. Again, it’s hard to stand against something too ardently when it gives so many people so much, but partisans have made it a lot easier by turning preferences about art into a referendum on character. Were I inclined to meet them on these uncharitable grounds, the response would probably go something like this: the attachment to and fierce protection of niceness is a sign of weakness, of needing to be coddled as literally and directly as possible. This is to say that mandated kindness compels an equal and opposite reaction of meanness, which isn’t how I prefer to live. Nice things are indeed nice, to quote a big-hearted show studied enough in its attitude to exclude itself from this trend. It’s a matter of an oversized market share on the conversation for pop culture without the heft to sustain its what-we-need-right-now reputation. The online dictum about the importance of letting people like things cuts both ways, the right to dislike things every bit as sacred.",Arts/Culture,Be kind rewind: the unstoppable rise of ‘nicecore’ films and TV,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/03/rise-of-nicecore-optimistic-films-tv
5/4/2022,"Bill Gates has responded to allegations of an extramarital affair on the first anniversary of the joint announcement that he and Melinda French Gates were getting divorced. “I certainly made mistakes and I take responsibility,” the Microsoft co-founder told Today on Tuesday morning when asked if he was ever unfaithful throughout his 27-year marriage to French Gates. “The divorce is definitely a sad thing,” the 66-year-old billionaire and philanthropist said, adding, “I have responsibility for causing a lot of pain to my family. It was a tough year. I feel good that all of us are moving forward now.” Gates added: “Melinda and I are continuing to work together. It was sad and tragic, but now we’re moving together.” Gates refused to disclose additional details about the affair, saying, “I don’t think delving into the particulars at this point is constructive, but yes, I caused pain and I feel terrible about that.” In an interview with CBS in March, French Gates explained that numerous factors led to the couple’s high-profile divorce last May. “There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasn’t healthy,” she said. “I couldn’t trust what we had.” French Gates also revealed that she cried numerous times during her marriage, sometimes while lying on the floor. “How can I get up? How am I going to move?” she would ask herself, she said. In response to French Gates’s comments, Bill Gates said, “This was a very tough thing. … We had a lot of amazing things in our marriage. The kids, the foundation, the enjoyment we had. And so it’s a very hard adjustment.” He continued: “I know divorces are different, but it’s just a complete change. We were partners, we kind of grew up together, and now that’s different. We’re not married.” French Gates described her current relationship with Bill Gates as “friendly” but explained she is not friends with her former husband. “Friends is a different word for me,” French Gates said. “That might come over time. But for me there’s still healing that needs to happen.” Gates has released a new book called How to Prevent the Next Pandemic in which he outlines steps the world should take to avoid another global outbreak.",News/US news,‘I caused pain’: Bill Gates responds to allegations of affair a year after divorce,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/bill-gates-affair-allegations-divorce-melinda-french
5/4/2022,"People who have been hospitalised with Covid may be left with difficulties in thinking comparable in magnitude to ageing 20 years, research suggests. As the pandemic swept the world it became apparent that coronavirus could not only cause immediate health problems but also leave some people with often debilitating symptoms – a condition known as long Covid. According to one UK study, about a third of patients who experienced symptoms after being hospitalised felt fully recovered a year later, with little improvement for most patients in areas including physical function and cognitive impairment. Now experts have revealed that some patients were left with, on average, a lingering cognitive decline. David Menon, a professor at Cambridge University and senior author of the study, said the degree of impairment was linked to the severity of illness. “[Covid] does cause problems with a variety of organs in the body, including the brain and our cognitive function and our psychological health,” he said. “If you can have a vaccine, and all your doses, you will have less severe illness. So all of these problems are going to be less.” Writing in the eClinicalMedicine journal, Menon and colleagues report how they examined the results of cognitive tests performed by 46 patients, on average six months after they were admitted to Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge between March and July 2020. Of this group, 16 received mechanical ventilation. The cognitive tests were carried out via the Cognitron platform, developed by researchers at Imperial College London, which formed the basis of the BBC’s Great British Intelligence Test. The team compared the results with those of 460 people who took part in the BBC challenge and who had never had Covid. Ten people were matched for each patient according to characteristics such as age, gender, education and first language. The results suggest those who were hospitalised with Covid had particular cognitive impairments, including slower processing speed. “The thing they struggle with most is verbal reasoning,” said Menon, noting that included completing analogies such as laces are to shoes what buttons are to coat. The study suggests that while the cognitive impairments were distinct, the magnitude of the change was, on average, on a par with the cognitive decline seen as people age from 50 to 70 years old. The team found no strong difference in the level of cognitive impairment between those who completed the tests six months after hospital admission and patients tested at 10 months, although there were hints of an improvement. The will return for further tests to see if a stronger association has emerged. Menon added that investigating cognitive decline in Covid patients may not only help them but also those who experienced similar problems after other illnesses. “The trials that we will be able to conduct will allow us to understand the underlying mechanisms and produce effective treatments to prevent it happening and perhaps treat it later,” he said.",News/Science,Covid hospitalisation may affect thinking similar to 20 years of ageing,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/03/covid-hospitalisation-thinking-ageing-cognitive-decline-illness
5/4/2022,"Candidates in 21 council areas in Thursday’s local elections have pledged to roll back low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) or clean air zones, a Guardian analysis of Facebook ad library data has found. Most of the adverts – 136 out of 164 analysed – were placed by Tory candidates, putting local Conservative parties at odds with central government which has encouraged councils to adopt clean air zones and LTNs, and funded the schemes. Labour candidates have placed six adverts criticising a clean air zone or LTN, while Liberal Democrats have placed three and independent candidates have placed 19. Clean air zones restrict the movement of older, more polluting vehicles to improve air quality, while low-traffic neighbourhoods are areas in which motor traffic is prevented from using residential streets as cut-throughs. If clean air zones were implemented across eight UK cities, they would deliver, on average, an 18% reduction in nitrogen dioxide, a harmful pollutant, according to research by CBI Economics. However, these schemes have often divided opinion, and ads that oppose a clean air zone (CAZ) or LTN have been viewed 613,000 times on Facebook since the start of this year. Adverts opposing clean air zones were particularly prevalent in Greater Manchester, with 51 placed by local candidates in the period analysed. Trafford Conservatives ran 14 ads criticising clean air zones. One advert that ran in April stated: “Labour have done nothing for you other than spend millions on trying to tax you to drive with Greens and Lib Dems.” The start date for a Manchester CAZ, which would be the UK’s largest, has been delayed after disagreements between the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the government over funding. Misinformation about the Manchester CAZ has been widely shared on Facebook, according to separate analysis using the analytics tool Crowdtangle. The most popular organic post mentioning the scheme claimed that authorities had cut down trees by a motorway junction near Wigan in order to install CAZ signage. The post later received 43,000 interactions on Facebook when it was reposted by a meme page. A spokesperson for Highways England, which manages the land around the Orrell Interchange, said no trees had been removed to install the sign. Trafford Conservatives said in a statement: “On Thursday, voters in Trafford have a choice. They can vote for a Labour council’s 493 square mile charging zone, supported by the Liberal Democrats and Greens, who all want to make it more expensive and more difficult to get to work, to see your family or to get around your day. “Alternatively, they can vote for a fresh start with the Conservatives, who will prioritise making life easier for hard working families and small businesses.” In London, which has the highest coverage of low-traffic neighbourhoods in the UK, Conservative candidates placed 65 ads pledging to remove them. The highest number were run by local parties in the outer suburban boroughs of Croydon and Enfield. Enfield Conservatives said the Labour administration had not listened to people about two new LTNs and created “more pollution, more congestion”. Official monitoring data from Enfield council shows traffic volumes inside its Fox Lane LTN fell by 72% on average after its introduction, while boundary roads saw an average increase of 6%. Stephen Edwards, the chief executive of Living Streets, said: “Nobody wants to vote for dangerous roads, air pollution and rat running. The government’s own evidence shows that there is overwhelming support for traffic reduction and space being reallocated to people walking, wheeling and cycling.” “Of course, if low-traffic schemes aren’t working, authorities should be working with residents to find other ways to reduce car dominance and prioritise people.”",News/Politics,Candidates in 21 council areas run ads opposing LTNs and clean air zones,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/03/candidates-in-21-council-areas-run-ads-opposing-ltns-and-clean-air-zones
5/4/2022,"Kevin De Bruyne believes Manchester City have to win the Champions League to change the perception of the club despite their recent domestic domination. Pep Guardiola’s team will reach a second successive final if Real Madrid are knocked out at the Bernabéu on Wednesday. City hold a 4-3 advantage from the first leg. In the past decade City have claimed five Premier League titles, the FA Cup and six League Cups with the European Cup the main prize to have eluded them. The 1970 Cup Winners’ Cup remains their only European silverware. “I think it would change the perspective from outside,” he said of Champions League victory. “As a player you want to win trophies and we want to win this one. The fact we’ve been fighting for numerous years and getting to the latter stages means we’ve been doing really well. It’s a cup competition and the quality is very high so it’s very difficult to win it but in the end if you look back at the way we performed and I have performed over seven years we have done really well. We have not won it but winning it would change that little narrative. “I don’t think it changes the perspective of how I look at myself as a player. I’ve known what I’ve done good and bad in my career and I’m pretty happy with what I’ve done. I want to win every trophy that I can get but that’s a hard task. I would obviously love to win the Champions League.” De Bruyne is likely to be the only City player to start on Wednesday who was also in the XI that lost 1-0 at Madrid in the second leg of the 2016 semi-final, when Fernando scored a decisive own goal. “I think we are in better shape now,” he said. “I remember when we played that game and didn’t have the greatest end of the season. Madrid was the powerhouse at the time. I know we lost 1-0 in the end with an own goal but it was a pretty boring game if I remember correctly. We’re in better shape right now, we are better set up as a team and play better and have more experience in this stage so we will hopefully be better prepared.” Real Madrid (4-3-3) Courtois; Carvajal, Nacho, Militão, Mendy; Modric, Casemiro, Kroos; Valverde, Benzema, Vinícius. Manchester City (4-1-1-3-1): Ederson; Walker, Laporte, Dias, Cancelo; Rodri; De Bruyne; Mahrez, Silva, Foden; Jesus. Wednesday’s game is Guardiola’s ninth Champions League semi-final as a manager. De Bruyne was asked whether this experience could help the team. “No matter the game we are well prepared anyway,” the midfielder said. “Whether it is the League Cup against a lower-league team there are the same amount of details for us. It is easier to watch a Madrid game on the TV than someone from the lower leagues but every game we play we want to win.” De Bruyne has scored seven goals in his past 10 games, a return to his finest form after the ankle injury that blighted his start to the season. “The first months of the season were really hard,” he said. “I have never experienced the pain that I had back then. I was trying to come back but was in pain with my ankle every day and it wasn’t something I enjoyed.” De Bruyne struggled to play through it. “Mentally it was hard to overcome that but once the pain was gone after a couple of months I started to feel more confident in myself and my body to get back to where I belong,” he said. “Now playing all these games week in, week out I feel back to the level that I was before.” Guardiola expects the match to be as open as last Tuesday’s first leg. “Probably but we can play much, much worse than we played and win,” said the manager. “Nobody knows, football is unpredictable. Sometimes you don’t get what you deserve, sometimes you get something you don’t deserve.” Kyle Walker has missed the past five matches with an ankle problem but has returned to training. “He is going to travel and tomorrow we will decide,” Guardiola said. “He was three weeks without training. We will decide tomorrow but we are happy he is back and he will try to be in contention.” If Walker starts, City will have their first-choice back four, the right-back joining Rúben Dias, Aymeric Laporte and João Cancelo, who was suspended for the opening leg. Carlo Ancelotti can field Casemiro again after the holding midfielder’s muscular problem, though the head coach of the newly crowned La Liga champions denied this would cause Real to alter how they defend. “If we bring back our defensive line we’ll be conceding more chances,” he said. “In the first leg I had a feeling we needed to take our chances, which we did, and we need to do so again. We are good enough to take them.”",Sport/Football,De Bruyne admits City need Champions League trophy to ‘change the narrative’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/kevin-de-bruyne-admits-manchester-city-need-champions-league-trophy-to-change-narrative
5/4/2022,"With detailed studies of flaking, iron-blooded rock, printed at monumental scale Ingrid Pollard directs our thoughts to the bigger picture. The title of her show, Carbon Slowly Turning, might describe the motion of the spinning Earth, with you, me, the trees and other carbon-based life upon it. But Pollard’s urge to revisit and remix art made across four decades also makes me think of a compost heap – in a good way. The show concludes with some of her oldest work – body shots from 1991 articulating lesbian experience – alongside her most recent, looking at pride, propaganda and national identity. It’s as though Pollard is constantly turning her pile of leaves, pulling old material through new, to see what mycelium it might generate. Pollard is, primarily, a photographer, and as with Wolfgang Tillmans, is interested in the qualities of the photograph as an object, and how modes of presentation can transform the way we read an image. Opposite the entrance hangs a row of silvery photographs of a wind-scoured section of British coast: The Boy Who Watches Ships Go By. Here, weather-bleached wood protrudes from pebbles like old bone; the hull of a boat exposes its scraped age above the shingle; a lighthouse is spied across islands of silt. Hand-tinted, printed in a blotchy, painterly way on canvas, the pictures appeal to melancholic nostalgia. The watcher here is Pollard, staring through the viewfinder, and scrutinising prints in the darkroom. But as two fragments of 18th-century text printed above the photographs indicate, the watcher is also an African child, long dead, who once played the fiddle as “Captain’s boy” on a boat loaded with human cargo, travelling between the Gambia and Jamaica. Glimpsed portraits of the artist in Hastings (Seaside Series, 1989), are framed with sticks of rock and souvenirs, above scraps of text referring to the last successful invasion of Britain, and other sorts of intrusion (“… and what part of Africa do you come from?”) Pollard is interested in aesthetics of the coast, but she’s also interested in Britain’s long sea border as a place of departure and arrival, whether you come as a tourist, an invader, an enslaved servant, or a migrant. The standout work here is Seventeen of Sixty Eight (2019), which artfully matches conceptual enquiry to Pollard’s interest in how visual information is displayed and dispersed. Through objects and pictures of many kinds – colourless images embossed on white paper, facsimiles of redacted book pages, metal tokens, stained glass, pub signs – she drags the deeply embedded history of African bodies in Britain into view. The sites in her photographs are unremarkable – rural inns, suburban lanes, tracts of countryside – yet all bear a title referring to a “Black Boy”. Someone – or some incident – touched each place in a way that left a memory of a person (though not their name) as a marker. In among these artefacts and images is a lone photograph of a grotesque blackface “minstrel” marionette. A neat white box sits on a neat white plinth in among the signage and statuary in the centre of the gallery. Click open the doors and music leaps from within: a video in which the minstrel puppet dances for your eyes alone. Close them again and, like a jack-in-the-box, he is hidden from view. As ever with Pollard, the mode of display is very particular: there’s something obscene about this entire device. The title – Seventeen of Sixty Eight – is left unexplained, though it tells us we’re only seeing a fragment of a larger picture. An earlier version was shown at Baltic in Gateshead, after Pollard was selected for the 2019 Baltic Artists’ award. This was the first in a victorious hop skip and jump for the 69-year-old artist. The exhibition at Milton Keynes is the result of Pollard’s receipt of the 2020 Freelands award for mid-career women artists. This show in turn has garnered her a nomination for the Turner prize. Proceeding through the exhibition, it becomes harder to ignore what sound like particularly grating building works near by. Stepping into the final room, we meet the source of the noise: Bow Down and Very Low – 123 (2021), a trio of kinetic sculptures, two of which (a pair of bending, scraping metal saws, and a body of knotted ship’s rope) appear to genuflect, and the third of which impotently swings a baseball bat. Behind them is a row of lenticular prints of a little Black girl in a white 1940s dress, trapped forever as she bobs in and out of a curtsy. As a central room exploring portraiture and narrative attests, Pollard is a captivating photographer, but there are many layers of enquiry going on beyond the surface seduction. This is not easy art – it doesn’t come with a neat punchline. I think even for the artist, associations shift with every turn of the compost heap.

5/4/2022,"Stephen Colbert caught up on a deluge of January 6th committee news following a week off from the Late Show with Covid. Starting with: the 2,319 text messages handed over to the committee by Donald Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. “That’s a lot of messages,” Colbert said on Monday evening. “Luckily Meadows has T-Mobile’s Unlimited Talk and Treason plan.” The messages included an exchange between Meadows and Sean Hannity, in which Meadows encouraged the Fox News host to “stress every vote matters”. “Yes sir … on it,” Hannity responded. “That is a shocking level of toadyism, even for a guy who looks like a bullfrog,” said Colbert. “But he’s just living up to the Fox News slogan: ‘We report. You decide what we should say, and by the way, your boot tastes delicious today, Mr President.” On Friday, Hannity “tried to claim he wasn’t caught – he meant to have no ethics,” Colbert continued. According to Hannity, “I don’t claim to be a journalist. I claim to be a talk show host … I make no apologies, I give my opinions straightforward. We even do culture, we do sports, I’m like the whole newspaper.” “Yes, Sean Hannity is just like a newspaper – out of date, bad for the planet, only relevant to people over 70, and I’d love to see a puppy poop on him,” Colbert noted. There were also messages from former Trump energy secretary Rick Perry claiming to have non-existent evidence of voter fraud. Perry denied sending the texts, though they were signed “Rick Perry” and included his phone number. “Why are these guys so bad at committing crimes?” Colbert wondered. “It’s like if they Zodiac Killer released a note that said ‘This is the Zodiac speaking. To unearth my identity solve the enclosed cipher … and return to John Evans, 1414 Hawthorne Lane. Good luck!’” Trump can’t remember who he’s endorsing in the Ohio GOP primary. Is it JD Vance, Josh Mandel, or a little bit of both? pic.twitter.com/C576CH2P74 On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah checked in on the contentious Republican Senate primary in Ohio, led by Yale Law graduate and famous author JD Vance. The venture capitalist “became famous for writing the book turned horrible movie Hillbilly Elegy, where he explained that white people become racist because they’re poor,” Noah explained. “Yeah, that’s why they say the N-word with a hard R, because they can’t afford a vowel.” During the book’s promotional run in 2016, Vance was a vocal critic of Trump. He was a self-described “Never Trump guy”, called him “unfit for office” and “cultural heroin”, with policy proposals that “range from immoral to absurd”. Not any more. Vance has embraced Trump during the campaign, releasing an ad in which he proclaims: “Trump fought back, and so have I.” His GOP rivals have similarly toadied up to the former president; competitor Josh Mandel’s slogan is “Pro-God. Pro-Gun. Pro-Trump.” “Whether it’s JD Vance or Kevin McCarthy or countless other Republicans, the entire party right now is basically Mean Girls,” Noah said. “They all talk shit about Trump behind his back, but then to his face it’s all like, ‘Oh my God, Donald, you look so hot!’” And “after months of competing to see who could stick their nose the furthest up Trump’s ass,” the former president endorsed his former critic. “Although clearly Trump doesn’t really care about these people as much as they care about him,” he noted, because Trump misnamed Vance as “JP, I mean JD Mandel” at a rally on Sunday. “I feel bad for JD Vance, because now he’s going to have to change his name to JP JD Mandel,” Noah joked. “Because if you’re a Republican, Trump is never wrong. At the GOP Starbucks, whatever name Trump calls, that’s you.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers reacted to news that a judge ruled that Trump is still in contempt of court for refusing to comply with a subpoena as part of the New York attorney general’s investigation into his company. The judge rejected Trump’s affidavit that he couldn’t find the documents the requested documents. “It doesn’t surprise me at all that Trump says he can’t find the documents they want,” Meyers said. “I’m betting the Trump organization didn’t have actual files. I doubt they even recorded any of their meetings.

Married for donkey’s years, the couple are somewhere in their 80s or 90s. This film is airily unspecific about such details, although every clip showing one of their film appearances is accompanied by a date, some going back to the 1940s. Manchester-reared Barry started out as a “ballet boy”, trained with famed dancer Stanislas Idzikowski whom he still refers to as his “beloved master”, and even appeared in Powell and Pressburger’s The Red Shoes in 1948. Joan, from the more genteel home counties, was a second or third generation musician and came up through the business as a dancer as well, but also tickled the ivories; now she mostly plays accompaniment on the piano in the couple’s studio as they train various adult pupils in the mysteries of commedia, diction and performance in general. The students interviewed here clearly adore them, and talk with endearing, gushy enthusiasm about the experience of learning from them. Director Audrey Rumsby, one of the Granthams’ students herself, clearly shares that affection but smartly upholsters her film with a rich seam of archive footage and original animation that goes well beyond the title couple themselves. As a result, the movie provides a brisk, efficient primer on commedia dell’arte, from its roots in Italy and on through Molière and Shakespeare, on to vaudeville and Max Miller, and right up to James Corden and One Man, Two Guvnors. Friends of the Granthams offer extra insight about the use of masks and acting skills. The whole package works a treat for theatre geeks, mime fans and lovers of “eccentric dance.”  Barry & Joan is released on 6 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Barry & Joan review – joyful celebration of eccentric entertainers,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/barry-joan-review-joyful-celebration-of-eccentric-entertainers
5/4/2022,"A man has been found guilty of threatening a Labour MP after he held a makeshift gallows with a noose outside parliament and said: “This is what we do to traitors.” Lance O’Connor, 57, called out the name of the Hove MP, Peter Kyle, as he walked across Parliament Square in central London on 20 October last year, Westminster magistrates court heard on Tuesday. The trial was told that O’Connor, 57, then pointed to a set of 6ft gallows before shouting out the threat. Kyle, 51, a former charity sector executive, was elected to parliament in 2015 and serves as the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland. O’Connor, of Plaistow, east London, appeared in court holding a wooden walking stick in the shape of a gallows with a small noose attached. He said he built the gallows as a protest against “draconian” lockdown measures and to remind the government that “treason is still punishable by the gallows”, though he denied targeting or shouting anything at Kyle. The district judge Neeta Minhas found O’Connor guilty of causing Kyle harassment, alarm or distress, after a short trial. She handed O’Connor a conditional discharge for 12 months, meaning he must not commit another offence within that period, and ordered him to pay £660, including £200 to Kyle. O’Connor said he would appeal against the decision and was heard muttering “complete travesty” as he left court. During the trial, Kyle told the court he had felt “chilled” and “threatened” by the incident, which came less than a week after the murder of the Conservative MP Sir David Amess. He said he had been returning to parliament from a lunch meeting when he heard his name being called “in an angry shout”. “I looked briefly at what I was seeing and then away but then as I proceeded I turned back to have another look because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” he said. “I saw a man standing there holding gallows with a noose in Parliament Square. “The word ‘traitor’ was being used and then, when I looked across the road again, a man said: ‘This is what we do with traitors.’” Kyle said he then saw the man pointing up at the noose. He also took a photo of the scene, which he later posted to Twitter and which was shown to the court. He said he ran back to his office after the incident because he considered the man’s action as a “direct threat to myself and a direct threat to other members of parliament”. He added that after Amess’s death there had been an “atmosphere around Westminster that was chilling, so to see that was horrifying.” The court heard that another man, Stephen Tiller, who had been on his way to another protest, approached the defendant when he saw the gallows and asked: “What is that for?” “He said: ‘All those fuckers in there,’ and pointed towards parliament,” Tiller told the court. Questioned by Martin Smith, defending, Kyle said he had not spoken to the defendant during the encounter because MPs were told by security services not to engage with threatening protesters. Asked whether he knew for certain that it was the defendant who shouted the threat, Kyle said: “To the best of my knowledge. I’m pretty sure it was the person who was pointing to the gallows whose mouth was moving.” O’Connor told the court he had not known Kyle was an MP, and claimed Kyle approached him and asked: “Do you think that is appropriate?” “I pointed across the road at the Palace of Westminster and said: ‘What I think is inappropriate is the draconian measures the people in parliament have made,’” O’Connor said.",News/UK news,Man found guilty of threatening ‘traitor’ Labour MP with noose,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/03/man-found-guilty-of-threatening-labour-mp-peter-kyle-with-noose-lance-oconnor

The list, the very long list, includes Club Brugge in 1976, Saint-Étienne in 1977, Milan in 2005, Hicks and Gillett in 2010 and Barcelona in 2019. So even though most of us think Liverpool have nine toes in the Big Cup final, they’ll be taking the square root of bugger all for granted in Villarreal. Liverpool lead 2-0 from the first leg, in which their sadistic heavy metal football came within an overzealous semitone of causing collective tinnitus among the Villarreal squad. Unai Emery sent eight players to the Ear, Nose & Throat department at the weekend nonetheless, so Villarreal will be refreshed for Mission: Nigh-on Impossible. They are also boosted by the return of Gerard Moreno, arguably their best player, though Alberto Moreno – a thorn in Liverpool’s side over the years – is out with an ACL injury. Villarreal’s record at El Madrigal is extremely good, and Jürgen Klopp does not share the complacency that is rife among the teatime email fraternity. “It will be tough but that’s completely fine,” he said, instantly demonstrating more personality, authority and charisma in his second language than The Fiver has ever managed in its first innit. “It’s the [Big Cup] semi-final – it shouldn’t be easy. They will go with all they have. That is absolutely clear from the things Unai said after the [first leg] and from the weekend where they made eight changes and took the other two off at half-time. We know that at points we will suffer. We could go behind, the crowd will be up after a big challenge; it could happen. Suffering doesn’t mean for long. It’s about how you react.” This time last year, Liverpool were really suffering. They were seventh in the Premier League, two points above Everton, and struggling to qualify for any European competition, never mind the big one. One spectacular 12-month reaction later, they are two games away from winning a seventh Big Cup. They might also be seven games away from quadruple-based immortality. It’s unthinkable that they won’t go through tonight. But Liverpool know better than anyone that, on big European nights, there’s a very big difference between unthinkable and impossible.

5/4/2022,"For a while it looked as if Boris Johnson might have been hiding in a fridge for a second time. Good Morning Britain’s interview with the prime minister had been scheduled to start at 8.15 and by 8.25 there was still no sign of him. Back in the ITV studio, Richard Madeley was having to fill time with a Zoom interview with Patrick Kielty. The Irish comedian and presenter used the dead air to remind everyone that Johnson was a liar so the time wasn’t entirely wasted. It certainly teed things up nicely for Susanna Reid when a crumpled and pasty-faced Johnson eventually joined her in his Downing Street study just before 8.30. After reminding him that it had been 1,791 days since he had last appeared on GMB, Reid cut to the chase. “Are you honest, prime minister?” she asked. “Yes,” replied the Convict. The interview had run for less than 20 seconds and Johnson had already told his first lie. Reid gave him a second chance to rethink his answer. Neither she nor Boris seemed to think it at all unusual that the first thing she would want to ask a prime minister after five years was whether he was a liar. Both knew the presumption was that he was. That’s how low we’ve sunk. A country reduced to the level of a shallow narcissist. The Convict blustered, trying to hedge his bets. It wasn’t that he was lying, more that he was a controversialist. In his dreams. He’s just a tired joke that’s no longer funny. A washed up end of the pier act. Even so, Johnson couldn’t help digging. A man always desperate to go lower still. “I do my best to represent faithfully and accurately what I believe,” he said. This was telling. Both for the admission that the truth does not come easily to him, that at times there is an unbridgeable gap between fantasy and reality in his consciousness, and the implicit acknowledgment that the only cause in which he truly believes is his own survival. And that for him there is a warped nobility in being dishonest in pursuit of that end. Even now he can’t bring himself to admit that he deliberately misled parliament over Partygate. Despite having attended many of the parties himself. That’s not just lying. It’s a pathology. After a brief dip into Ukraine – Johnson was adamant the Russians were grooming children as sleeper agents, which was why the UK was insisting on visas for all refugees – Reid moved on to the cost of living. The Convict was adamant the government was doing everything it could, apart from the areas in which it could be doing more. He didn’t even appear to notice he had just contradicted himself. So much for his famous Oxford Union debating skills. Rather, he was mostly intent on talking over Reid and trying to wind down the clock on the interview. Even he could see the interview was turning into a car crash and his legs widened further apart the more he tried to mansplain his way out of it. Reid was not so easily deflected and wondered how Elsie was supposed to get by. Elsie was a 77-year-old pensioner who could now afford to eat only one meal a day and had taken to using her bus pass to ride the buses all day during off-peak hours to keep warm. A hint of recognition from The Convict. “I brought in the Freedom Pass as London mayor,” he chipped in. He hadn’t of course, but the lie was the least of it. The real giveaway was what this said about Johnson. There was no compassion for Elsie and people like her who were struggling, not just to get by but to stay alive. No sense of duty to or responsibility for the country he professed to serve. Just an eagerness to take the credit for making it possible for pensioners to spend their days keeping warm at the bus company’s expense. As if this was somehow a brilliant government initiative for which the likes of Elsie ought to be grateful. Next up the Convict will be claiming the night tube was designed as accommodation for those who can’t afford heating. The concrete is good for our backs. Lucky, lucky us. By now Johnson was visibly struggling. Any thoughts of a triumphant, soft pre-elections interview had long since crashed and burned as he ramped up his diversionary tactics. But Reid stayed focused. How much had the carers’ allowance gone up by? Boris hadn’t a clue. And didn’t really care. He just wanted his ordeal to end. But his eagerness to get away only turned the car crash into a multiple pile-up. Energy companies couldn’t possibly be expected to pay a windfall tax as BP was struggling to get by on £6bn profits from the last quarter. People like Elsie shouldn’t be so greedy. It was time for her to stop wondering what the government could do for her and to start being a bit more altruistic. By eating once every other day, for example. And if she could learn to think of tax rises as tax cuts then she’d have more money to spend and wouldn’t need to waste what was left of her life going backwards and forwards on the South Circular. Most of all, Elsie should understand that 10% inflation was her fault so she should be the one who suffered. For the last few minutes – when she could get a word in edgeways – Reid reverted to the Convict’s honesty. How come we had a prime minister who was the centre of a one-man crime wave? And why did everyone else who was guilty of breaking the law have to resign when he stayed put? Johnson mumbled something about being proud of what he had achieved – imagine the cognitive dissonance – before Reid called time. “Lorraine’s waiting,” she said. “Lorraine who?” asked Johnson. For once, this wasn’t an act. He genuinely had no idea who Lorraine Kelly was. It was almost as if he suspected that ITV might have rustled up yet another lover with a paternity suit. The Convict’s days as the self-styled man of the people are long gone. And it will be well more than five years before he agrees to another GMB interview.

5/4/2022,"I’m listening to two tenors – Philip Lee and Daniel Koek – sing a love duet. It’s O Soave Fanciulla from Puccini’s La Bohème, one of the most performed scenes in the opera repertoire, written for a male and a female voice. In our new English-language version, Rodolfo, a tenor role, meets Lucas, an online hook-up whose friends have given the nickname Mimi, and who is also sung by a tenor. Having directed a much more conventional Bohème 30 years ago, I was concerned that casting two singers of the same voice type might flatten the colours and dynamics of the duet. But as we rehearse, Daniel’s Rodolfo becomes a confident, boastful figure prone to exaggeration and sentiment, while Phil’s Mimi is a tentative, uneasy presence who ultimately sees himself and the world with more mature eyes than his enthusiastic lover. I realise they actually have very different vocal qualities, which sharpens their distinctive spirits as characters. Two gay men singing some of the world’s most romantic music to each other brings out a vulnerability and honesty in Daniel and Phil as performers, while feeling like a comic transgression of the unwritten rules of opera. At the end of the rehearsal, which takes place in a tiny room in the West End of London, I look at our website describing this production as a “queer reinvention” of Puccini and wonder, in the light of what’s happening in the rehearsal room, if that’s the right line to take. Phil and Daniel are playing the scene so naturally and easily. It’s a political statement of its own, I suppose, but not the aggressive challenge to heteronormativity that “queering Puccini” might suggest. I call the office and we reword the website. I was 27 when I first directed La Bohème – for Opera East, a middle-scale touring company. It was my first job as an opera director and I prepared furiously, listening to recordings, reading biographies of Puccini and (never having learned to read music) going over and over the dots until I could follow the score. Once in the rehearsal room, I focused on my relationship with the singers – would they think in the same way as actors I was used to? – and with the conductor, sitting beside me with his baton in the air, a figure I’d never had to contend with as a director of new plays. Returning to Puccini now, I see that my 27-year-old self had a lot in common with Rodolfo and Mimi and their bohemian cohort. Back then, I was writing an early unproduced play, fending off demands for late payment of rent in a very shabby flat. Only the year before, I had lost my partner to an Aids-related illness. Why didn’t I see the parallels with Puccini’s story? Too in awe, perhaps, of Bohème’s status as one of the world’s greatest operas, too concerned with understanding the technicalities of the music and the staging. I realise that, just as I was directing my rather conventional opera, Jonathan Larson was at the New York Theatre Workshop, developing his response to La Boheme: the musical Rent. In Puccini, Larson had found a model for a story of his own experience, in a way that I hadn’t. As rehearsals progressed at Opera East, I began to tire of the score: too sentimental, too manipulative for my Generation X sensibility. Leaving Bohème behind, I turned my hand to writing a new play. A response I thought, at the time, to all that Puccinian sentimentality. But as I return to Mimi and Rodolfo, I see that that play – which proved to be my breakthrough piece, Shopping and Fucking – has all sorts of parallels with Bohème: a group of flatmates struggling to pay the bills; the arrival of a troubled but ultimately doomed newcomer; the hovering presence of the older man with money. Spending time rehearsing a piece – whether a a play or an opera – imprints its shape and motifs on your mind. No surprise then, if the ghosts of Bohème inhabit Shopping and Fucking, even if I was unaware of it as I wrote. The text and arrangement for our new Bohème is written by Philip Lee, our Mimi, and our musical director, David Eaton. It reduces the piece to four central characters, one gay couple, one straight, as they navigate falling in and out of love and ultimately confronting mortality. Our early preview audiences laugh readily at the comic moments but, as the evening ends, there’s the sound of sobbing and when the house lights come up, I see that I’m surrounded by teary eyes. My own are distinctly moist. Perhaps it’s the intimacy of the venue, perhaps I’ve mellowed with the passage of time. I still have a lingering suspicion that Puccini is sentimental and manipulative – but La Bohème now touches me deeply. I wait until the audience has left and sit alone in the theatre, sobbing.  La Bohème is at The King’s Head theatre, London, until 28 May.",Arts/Music,‘Why didn’t I notice the parallels?’ – Mark Ravenhill on finally seeing his own life in La Bohème,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/03/parallels-mark-ravenhill-own-life-la-boheme-gay-version-puccini-doomed-love
5/4/2022,"Tom Youngs has revealed how he left the Leicester squad in tears after addressing his former teammates one last time following his retirement. Youngs, 35, announced he would be hanging up his boots last week but was invited by the current club captain Ellis Genge to address the side before Saturday’s victory over Bristol. Youngs said last week this was always going to be his final season with the club but he has not appeared for the Tigers since pre-season. In October he was given indefinite leave to care for his wife, Tiffany, who is ill. He brings the curtain down on his career with 215 appearances for the club, captaining the Tigers on 98 occasions and on Saturday led the side – including his brother Ben – out before kick-off with his daughter Maisie. Tiffany was also in the crowd as Leicester went on to claim a 56-26 victory against the Bears. “I just talked about how I’d love to do one more tackle for them and one more carry for them but I can’t,” said Youngs. “I talked about Tiff a little bit. I talked about life, and how when you’re in the moment, in that changing room, you don’t realise how good it is and how lucky you are sometimes. Ultimately, you don’t realise how cruel life can be sometimes, so you have to enjoy those moments. There wasn’t really a dry eye in the changing room. It was lovely, and those things will sit with me for a long time. Chris Ashton said he’s never been in such an emotional speech before a game, that’s all he said to me and that he appreciated being a part of my special day.” Youngs admitted that leaving Leicester on a high – Steve Borthwick’s side are currently top of the Premiership table with a home playoff already assured and face Leinster in the Champions Cup quarter-finals on Saturday – made retirement easier given the low points the Tigers had endured in recent years. Youngs led the club through those lean years with distinction before passing the baton on to Genge. “[Ellis] spoke to Ben [Youngs] and said they wanted me to come in the changing room, make a speech and lead the boys out,” he added. “I am very grateful for that one last opportunity. I never thought I’d get to do anything like that again. To do that one last time was fantastic. “Captaincy sometimes makes someone. I think when Gengey was announced as captain people probably saw it as a left-field thing to do. But he’s been absolutely brilliant, class in getting the boys together and I think it’s matured him as a person. He’s played brilliantly this year, fantastically for Leicester and brilliantly for England. He’s grown as an individual hugely.” If more recently Youngs has endured hardship at the Tigers – consecutive 11th-place finishes in the Premiership in 2019 and 2020 were obvious lows, as well as the 43-0 home defeat by Glasgow in Europe in 2017 – he has also sampled some highs, most notably when winning the 2012-13 title before being named player of the season, having successfully made the move from centre to hooker. That was the last of Leicester’s league titles but Youngs believes Borthwick’s current squad are well-placed to bring silverware back to Welford Road. “They are well equipped to do so,” said Youngs, who won 28 England caps and played a key role in the British & Irish Lions’ successful tour of Australia in 2013. He added: “They’re a tough side, a resilient bunch who have got belief in them ingrained now and I think that’s always tough to go and try and beat, to knock down. They’ll stay in the game all the time. It might come down to one or two decisions whether you win or lose but I think they’ll be right in the mix. Leinster are a very good side and Leicester will get another test this weekend, but I’m sure it’s one they’ll be very excited to answer. “You’ve got guys who have come through the academy which I think is hugely important. I’m excited by this squad, they’ve just grown and grown over the season, the belief has become more ingrained in them. That excites me because when you’ve got that belief and that confidence, it’s a very hard thing to stop at times.”",Sport/Sport,‘There wasn’t a dry eye’: Tom Youngs proud after his final Leicester team-talk,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/tom-youngs-proud-after-final-leicester-team-talk-rugby-union
5/4/2022,"It seems positively absurd to say this now, but in the summer of 2002, Spider-Man reached cinema audiences as a relative novelty. The superhero genre wasn’t dormant, though neither was it all-consuming. The goth-kitsch Batman cycle of the 1990s had petered out at that point, but successful adaptations of Blade and X-Men had resurrected Marvel Comics as viable cinematic fodder after direct-to-video stabs at Captain America and The Punisher. Blade, however, was an R-rated gorefest aiming for cultish endurance; X-Men, while a notch more accessible to younger viewers, was still a dark-ish, dour-ish affair intended first to please comic book loyalists. Swinging on to screens 20 years ago today, Spider-Man was different: a bright, goofy, youthful adventure with a wholesomeness that the genre hadn’t seen since the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman films two decades before. Geeky devotees of the then 40-year-old comic-book boy hero would be happy enough with director Sam Raimi’s bouncy screen origin story, but they weren’t necessarily its primary audience. Using the framework of an earlier script by an uncredited James Cameron, David Koepp’s screenplay positioned the young Peter Parker’s tale as a romantic adolescent coming-of-ager first, and a spandex-wars fantasy second – in doing so, it sought the attention of viewers who might, at face value, deem a film about a red-suited lad spinning webs and fighting crime across New York a bit childish for them. It worked, to the tune of over $825m worldwide. As Spider-Man stayed and stayed and stayed in cinemas that season, it netted families and the date-night crowd in addition to the nerds. “It might just restore the good name of movie escapism,” cheered Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers, amid a surfeit of unexpectedly strong reviews for Raimi’s film. Notably inclined towards hyperbole, Travers may for once have been guilty of understatement: even in the immediate glow of the film’s popularity, few could have anticipated just how drastically Spider-Man would reset the model of populist cinema. Two reboots, seven further Spidey films and a whole entangled cinematic universe later, the film’s chipper underdog demeanour now seems a kind of scrappy Trojan horse through which Marvel wheeled in hegemonic plans for multiplex domination. As a second-year university student with a fairly snotty attitude to all comic-book culture, I was among the many surprisingly charmed by Raimi’s vision: the film felt honestly dorky and good-natured in a way many of that summer’s assembly-line blockbusters (including wholly businesslike new issues of the Star Wars, Men in Black, Jack Ryan and Mummy franchises) did not. However manufactured its up-with-the-little-guy sentiment, it was hard not to like a film that offered Tobey Maguire – then the twiggy, faintly haunted-looking oddball of such films as The Ice Storm, Pleasantville and The Cider House Rules – a chance to play action hero, that part-unmasked him not for a pivotal plot reveal but a swooning kiss in the rain, and that briefly interrupted a key sequence of digitised urban carnage to let gangly, huge-haired R&B eccentric Macy Gray belt out a few bars of a track titled My Nutmeg Phantasy. If Spider-Man thus works pretty well as an insider film for outsiders, that’s largely down to the shaggy B-movie sensibility of Raimi. A prodigy who had made his name on the grisly, mordantly funny Evil Dead films, attempted his own stylish superhero original (to little commercial interest) in Darkman, and spent the 90s skipping between genres in such adult-targeted films as The Quick and the Dead and A Simple Plan, he wasn’t an obvious captain for a four-quadrant studio colossus with a six-figure budget. Everyone from chic stylist David Fincher to Batman saviour Tim Burton to family-film merchant Chris Columbus (who passed to launch the Harry Potter franchise instead) was considered before the Columbia Pictures chair, Amy Pascal, took a gamble on Raimi’s sincere comic-nerd enthusiasm – a virtue reflected in the film’s genial sympathy for misfits, as well as a brash, high-key aesthetic that aims to evoke the stylised panels of the original comics at every turn. It was Raimi, too, who lobbied for the unexpected casting of Maguire as Peter Parker, over the studio’s preference for more buffly handsome teen-idol types – Jude Law and James Franco (eventually cast as Parker’s snivelling frenemy Harry Osborn instead) among them. It was a coup that saved not just the film, but perhaps Marvel’s whole long-term agenda. Revisiting the film today, it’s Maguire’s sweet, strange boy-man quality – and his gentle chemistry with Kirsten Dunst, similarly cast against studio expectations as his sprightly-sad Mary Jane – that carries proceedings through some pretty rough patches in Koepp’s script, most problematically among them a villain who simply hasn’t got the goods. Even in 2002, despite the most lascivious efforts of Willem Dafoe, the Green Goblin seemed stiffly visualised and awkwardly motivated; it was the rare superhero film where the pyrotechnic action kept coming as a distraction from a more compelling relationship story. Raimi and his team ironed out those issues in 2004’s Spider-Man 2, an altogether sleeker, sharper affair that continued the first film’s endearing character work while subbing in a richer, funnier villain in Alfred Molina’s Doctor Octopus, and shooting for more ambitious visual majesty – with smoother, less chintzy effects work to boot. It remains the high-water mark of the extended Spider-Man universe: Raimi’s ill-advised second sequel didn’t measure up, and neither did either of the subsequent reboot phases, with Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland both broadly appealing but carrying little of Maguire’s poignant gawkiness. Twenty years on, the character of Spider-Man has become a key property in something far less intimate and ingratiating than Raimi’s comparatively modest 2002 blockbuster. Since Holland’s turn in the role was enfolded into Marvel’s tangled network of Avengers offshoots, any new individual Spider-Man films hardly have time for the pleasantly banal everyday concerns of the early-millennial Peter Parker. There’s not just a city to be saved – a priority that seemed more urgent in a film arriving months after the 9/11 attacks, as Raimi’s film cannily espoused all-for-one-and-one-for-all New Yorker sentiments – but an entire multiverse to be maintained. By the time Maguire’s Spider-Man returned in last year’s knotty Spider-Man: No Way Home, the quaintness of his take on the character (down to his organic, wrist-based web-spinning abilities, always a more exciting body-horror development than a fancily enabled suit) was quip fodder for subsequent generations. Everything changed, even as everything stays somewhat the same: even Raimi has been brought back into the Marvel fold, directing the latest outing for Spidey’s MCU colleague Doctor Strange, in cinemas this week. Back in 2002, the pressure was on the film-maker to reanimate a sleeping comic-book world; 20 years later, he just has to keep the machine running.",Arts/Film,Spider-Man at 20: the superhero film that changed blockbuster cinema,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/spider-man-at-20-the-superhero-film-that-changed-blockbuster-cinema
5/4/2022,"Pfizer has made nearly $26bn (£21bn) in revenues in the first three months of the year, the bulk from its Covid-19 vaccine and new pill to treat the virus, prompting fresh accusations of pandemic profiteering. Covid vaccines have saved many lives around the world and relieved the pressure on health systems, but Pfizer has faced criticism over its vaccine pricing and its refusal to waive patent protection to enable others to make the jab. Last week 35 campaigners from Global Justice Now, Act-Up London, Just Treatment and Stop Aids protested against what they call pandemic profiteering, and delivered wheelbarrows full of fake money to Pfizer’s UK headquarters in Surrey on the day of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. The New York-based firm posted total sales of $25.7bn in the first quarter, up 77% from a year earlier. Of this, $13.2bn came from the Comirnaty jab it developed with Germany’s BioNTech, driven by global uptake including jabs for children over the age of five, and booster doses. Pfizer and BioNTech are also seeking US approval for the vaccine’s use in children from six months to four years old. A further $1.5bn came from Paxlovid, a Covid pill for people who are at high risk of severe disease, including hospitalisation or death. The treatment received emergency approval from the US regulator in late December and has also been cleared by the UK and the EU. Pfizer has made tens of billions of dollars during the pandemic from its Covid-related products, as has the Boston-based biotech firm Moderna, which was loss-making until it started selling a Covid-19 vaccine. Tim Bierley, a pharma campaigner at Global Justice Now, said: “Throughout the pandemic, Pfizer has refused to share its technology and knowhow. Instead, it has maintained monopoly control over its vaccine and treatment, keeping a chokehold on global supply. “Despite calls from campaigners to allow countries in the global south to manufacture their own vaccines and treatments, Pfizer continues to put profit over people’s health. Pfizer’s revenues almost doubled last year and now it looks like the company’s coffers are set to swell even further. At a time when millions still don’t have access to vaccines or treatments for Covid-19, this continued pandemic profiteering is harrowing.” Pfizer’s revenues last year doubled to $81.3bn, and it expects to make record sales of $98bn to $102bn this year, half of which will come from Covid products – $32bn from Comirnaty and $22bn from Paxlovid. Other companies, led by AstraZeneca, Britain’s biggest drugmaker, and Johnson & Johnson, a big US firm, went down the not-for-profit route and priced their Covid vaccines at cost during the pandemic. Towards the end of last year, AstraZeneca moved away from its not-for-profit pricing in new contracts, but insists that it is still offering “equitable pricing”. Pfizer also says that it is offering lower prices to poorer countries. In March, it struck an agreement with Unicef to supply up to 4m treatment courses of Paxlovid to 95 low- and middle-income countries at a not-for-profit price, while upper to middle-income incomes will pay a price set under its tiered pricing strategy. Moderna has pledged to not enforce its coronavirus vaccine patents in some low- and middle-income countries.",News/Business,Pfizer accused of Covid profiteering as first-quarter sales hit $26bn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/pfizer-covid-sales-pricing-vaccine-paxlovid-pill
