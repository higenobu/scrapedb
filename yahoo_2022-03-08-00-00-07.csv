3/8/2022,"Andria Devlin, 47, was shocked to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer five years ago. The early childhood educator had no risk factors and no family history of the disease. Like many people, she put off getting her symptoms checked out when they appeared. Devlin, who lives in Lawrence, Kansas, shared her story with TODAY. This is not an easy topic to talk about, but it's so important. People should not die from embarrassment, and I think people are dying because they don’t want to go to their doctor and talk about the symptoms. It took me a long time to go in and say something is not right. I have always been a human who has lived more on the constipated side, so irregular bowel movements have been kind of my jam for forever. In 2016, I noticed mucuosy substances in my stool. It was different, but not concerning. Then I started having intermittent bleeding with my bowel movements. That, in conjunction with my constipation, equaled hemorrhoids in my brain. I had no stomach issues, no weight loss, no fatigue and all of my labs looked fine. There was nothing that would indicate that I had a tumor growing in my rectum, other than the constipation and the bright red blood in my stool. I hadn’t given much thought to colorectal cancer. Why would I? I was in my early 40s, I’m active, I exercise, I eat well, I don’t smoke. There were absolutely no risk factors and no family history that would make me think, ""Oh, you probably have cancer."" That’s why it took me way too long to go to the doctor. It took getting to the point where I was bleeding every time I had a bowel movement for me to just be tired of it. I remember mentioning it to my OB, who said to get it checked out. That was in May 2016, but I didn’t go to the doctor until January 2017. She did a rectal exam and didn’t feel any hemorrhoids, but gave me a suppository substance see if that would help. It slowed the bleeding down, but it did not stop it. I was then scheduled for a colonoscopy. I remember waking up from that and hearing the doctors say, “We found something very low in your rectum. It’s pretty ugly tissue.” My dad died of esophageal cancer, so when someone says ugly tissue, I know what that looks like. There were photos along with the colonoscopy report and it was certainly not the bright pink, healthy, happy tissue that you imagine that your insides look like. The doctor called the next day, which happened to be my child’s 15th birthday, and told me the tissue was cancerous. The tumor was significant, blocking 80 to 85% of my rectum. I was immediately sent to oncology at Lawrence Memorial Hospital. Scans revealed it was stage 4 colorectal cancer — it had spread beyond my rectum to both my lungs. I was in chemo treatments within two weeks of learning my diagnosis. Ultimately, the chemo took care of almost all of the cancer in my lungs and it shrunk the tumor. I had a rectal resection in August 2017. But there was a spot in my right lung that didn’t get smaller, it just stayed. A subsequent scan showed that it grew just a tiny bit. I had stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on that spot in February of 2018 — five sessions over five days. You don’t move during this therapy — they make a mold of your body so you lay in a very specific position every single time. I have two boys so I liked to think about “Star Wars” while the machine was doing its thing — like “pew pew” lasers zapping my cancer spot. In January of 2020, I had a scan that revealed another spot in that right lung, so I went through another round of SBRT. Today, I am just celebrating the fact that I am still alive. It’s pretty miraculous that someone with stage 4 colorectal cancer can say that at five years. I am still having clear scans right now. Cancer had already impacted our family and when that happens, there is a shift because life is precious and you don’t really recognize that until you have a life-altering diagnosis. When I was first diagnosed, I thought, ""You have to see your oldest kid graduate from high school."" So I’ve been just checking these boxes. My next checkbox is in May — my younger son is graduating from high school, so that’s what I’m going for. I’ll keep adding checkboxes to my list, like college graduations. I’m just making lots of memories and raising awareness. People don’t want to go to the doctor and say, “I’ve got mucus in my poop. What’s that about?” But people should not die from embarrassment. If I can talk about my experience and that gets one person to the doctor before I went to the doctor, I have done my job.

3/8/2022,"Sophia Faye Davis loved to eat noodles. She slept with a stuffed hippo that made soothing sounds and reflected stars on her ceiling. She sang and danced as she pounded on the keys of her toy piano. These are the memories of her only child Cassy Needham clings to — not the final month of Sophia’s life filled with child abuse allegations, failed investigations and ignored pleas for help that ended with a beating so severe the tiny, blonde, blue-eyed 19-month-old wouldn’t survive it. Sophia died Feb. 8. Sophia’s father’s girlfriend Cierra Coker is charged in Logan County with first-degree murder and aggravated battery to a child, accused of beating the toddler to death. But a month before she died, Needham reported her concerns her baby was being abused to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. But DCFS did not intervene, Needham said. As of Friday, the investigation into those claims remains open. On Jan. 2, Needham picked up her daughter from an overnight visit with the infant’s father and was shocked by the condition of her daughter. Needham found scratches on her head, a black eye, cuts on her mouth, bruises on her face, and what appeared to be friction burns on her face. Sophia wasn’t moving her left arm so Needham took her to HSHS St. John’s Hospital in Springfield. It was broken. “The doctor there told me they suspected child abuse and called DCFS,” Needham said. An investigation was opened and a DCFS worker came to her house the next day and asked to see Sophia, Needham said. She also checked Needham’s home to ensure it was safe and Sophia had the essentials. Another worker went to Sophia’s father’s home and spoke with the father and his girlfriend, Coker. It was relayed to Needham that Coker told the investigator Sophia was injured accidentally by other children in the home. “Her story kept changing, though. I was just very nervous about sending her back there,” Needham said. The investigator told Needham she would unfound the case, meaning they would find the allegations not credible. Sophia’s father was ready to see her again. “I asked if we could put a safety plan in place, but DCFS told me that they were going to unfound the case,” Needham said. Facing pressure from Sophia’s father to resume visitation, Needham agreed to let him take Sophia for the night Feb. 5. The next afternoon, Needham received a call from Coker, telling her Sophia was having trouble breathing and bleeding from her mouth. “I told her to call 911. I told her something was wrong,” Needham said. Eventually, Needham reached out herself to get help for her daughter. Paramedics arrived at the apartment in Lincoln that Coker shared with Sophia’s father. Emergency medical technicians transferred the baby to the hospital in Lincoln, but due to her serious condition she was airlifted to HSHS St. John’s Hospital in Springfield. But it was too late, Needham said. Sophia died Feb. 8. An autopsy would find she died as a result of a traumatic brain injury, due to blunt force injuries of the head. The DCFS investigation into the abuse allegations remains open. Sophia’s the third child in as many months to die after reports of abuse or neglect. DCFS Director Marc Smith has been held in contempt six times so far this year for failing put children under the state’s care in proper placements. A DCFS investigator was murdered when checking on the welfare of six children. The legislature has held hearings, but reform doesn’t mean anything to Needham. “None of this should have happened. I did everything I could to protect her and the system failed me,” Needham said.
