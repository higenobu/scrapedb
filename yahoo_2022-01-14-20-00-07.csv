1/14/2022,"Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel appeared on The Rachel Maddow Show Thursday, where she spoke about the scheme in which Republicans in several states that President Biden won forged election documents in an attempt to give the election to former President Trump. Fraudulent electors in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia sent documents to the National Archives to certify the election for Trump, despite Biden having won. While no one has been arrested yet in connection with this attempted election fraud, Nessel expects authorities to gather more evidence, and that this may have been orchestrated from the highest levels of government. “Once those individuals see that they could possibly be facing prison time, I do think we’re gonna see some people flip,” Nessel said, “and we’ll get some further information as to who orchestrated this in the first place, who told these people to do this in exactly this fashion, and I think it may go all the way to the top.” Nessel’s belief that the individuals involved were part of a larger conspiracy stems from the fact that, in every instance, the fraudulent documents followed almost the exact same template, in some cases not in any way resembling the real elector documents from a particular state. Which is why on Thursday, Nessel referred the case to federal authorities. “What we have decided to do with the investigation, in light of the fact that of course we have seen, as you (Maddow) have pointed out multiple times now,” Nessel said, “various different false slate of electors from [several] different states, in what seems to be a coordinated effort between the Republican Parties in various different states, we think this is a matter that is best investigated and potentially prosecuted by the feds.” While Nessel hasn’t ruled out bringing state charges, as double jeopardy does not apply in this case, she believes individuals involved could be facing significant federal charges. “Obviously, this is part of a much bigger conspiracy,”Nessel said, “and our hope is that the federal authorities and the Department of Justice, and United States Attorney General Merrick Garland, will take this in coordination with all the other information they’ve received, and make an evaluation as to what charges these individuals might face. I mean, I can think of many.” The Rachel Maddow Show airs weeknights at 9 p.m. on MSNBC. Watch Ted Cruz say he believes Biden should 'fess up' for FBI's supposed role in Trump-era Capitol riot: On Hannity Tuesday, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) pointed the finger at President Biden after an FBI official didn’t adequately answer all of his questions at a hearing earlier in the day. Cruz’s line of questioning was pushing a conspiratorial narrative about the FBI being involved in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, a narrative that Fox News opinion host Tucker Carlson has been pushing for months.
“Unfortunately, under Joe Biden we have seen an incredibly partisan Department of Justice,” Cruz said. “And both the Department of Justice and the FBI have an arrogance that they are not accountable to anyone, that they can stonewall.”
Much of what Cruz had to say was debunked earlier in the day in a series of tweets by Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL). And though the supposed transgressions on the part of the FBI would have occurred while Donald Trump was still president, Cruz believes it’s up to Biden to answer for it.
“There needs to be transparency and the Biden administration needs to fess up,” Cruz said. “Is this a politicized law enforcement operation that is targeting the enemies of the president, and did they actively encourage and solicit illegal conduct?” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:  'Joe Millionaire' contestant opens up about being the victim of sex trafficking David Spade recalls Tom Hanks 'SNL' sketch that 'bombed': 'Our eyes connected and we were like, it's over' Bob Costas weighs in on embattled tennis star Novak Djokovic's 'pattern of contempt for common sense' Tell us what you think!

1/14/2022,"Hours after Brett Kavanaugh joined the Supreme Court’s five other conservative judges and struck down Joe Biden’s employer vaccine mandate, Tucker Carlson blasted him as a “cringing little liberal” because he and Chief Justice John Roberts upheld a mandate for medical workers. The moment came after Carlson’s guest, Harmeet Dhillon, CEO of the Center for American Liberties, said that “10 million health-care workers do need to get vaccinated if they wish to keep their jobs, which is unfortunate given the massive shortage that we have of health-care workers right now in our hospitals.” Carlson interjected: “Yeah, with no help from Brett Kavanaugh, I notice—cringing little liberal.” The Fox News talker cheered the 6-3 decision from the conservative judges, including Kavanaugh, to strike down Biden’s mandate aimed at businesses with more than 100 employees. This, Carlson declared, was a blessing for “millions of Americans waiting to get fired from their jobs because they won’t obey this arbitrary command from the president.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/14/2022,"A dog-owner said she spent days searching for her pooch after it went missing under a Wag walker's care. Liz Giorgi said she was only told her dog, Fran, had died after she searched for eight days. Wag, an app that connects pet owners to independent walkers and sitters, has courted controversy before. A startup founder whose dog went missing under the care of pet-sitting company Wag said she was told her pet had died after spending eight days searching for the pup. Liz Giorgi, CEO of video and photo studio Soona, tweeted on Thursday that Wag delivered the news to her with the following message: ""I'm calling to report we have news on your pet. Our local contact has informed us she has not made it. She has passed away. These instances are incredibly rare but do happen. Do you have any questions?"" It's not immediately clear if Giorgi's dog, Fran, died while in a Wag walker's care or went missing and died afterward. Giorgi said she left her two dogs in Wag's care to go on a trip to Africa to honor the memory of her late father. On January 5, Giorgi was told that Fran had gone missing. She enlisted her mother-in-law's help to search for the dog because she was traveling in a remote location overseas, and any attempt to return to the US would take longer than five days, she added. Giorgi said she panicked when she couldn't find a to-do list or process for a lost dog or customer service on the Wag app. ""You just sit in the queue with everyone else,"" she said. According to Giorgi, Wag only responded to her 25 hours after it notified her of Fran's disappearance. She added that she was ""still waiting for a simple 'I'm sorry.'"" In the meantime, she rallied friends, family, and peers to scour her neighborhood in Denver, partially through NextDoor, a social networking app for neighbors. Several days later, on Thursday, Giorgi said she'd received confirmation that Fran had died. ""The dog tracker found her and called animal control,"" Giorgi explained in a tweet, noting that she was unable to see Fran a final time before animal control cremated her. ""We have her ashes now, though, and will make a large donation to the rescue that we adopted her from in her honor."" ""Adding insult to injury, they billed me for my dog sitting services yesterday. Such a joke. They said they would 'look into it,'"" she added. Wag, an app that connects dog owners with independent walkers or sitters evaluated by the company, was founded in 2015. Giorgi, Wag, and Wag CEO Garrett Smallwood did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment. The company has been embroiled in several past customer service controversies. In June 2019, a couple said their dog was stolen by a Wag walker, Buzzfeed News reported. And in November 2019, another customer tweeted a video of a Wag walker stealing items from her home. —Shayna Bryan (@Shayna_ABryan) November 21, 2019 The same year, a couple in Los Angeles filed a lawsuit against Wag, accusing the company of trying to cover up the death of their French bulldog, Burger. They alleged that Burger was under the care of a Wag walker, who stood on the sidewalk while allowing the 10-1/2-year-old dog to venture alone onto the crosswalk, resulting in Burger being fatally struck by a car. In 2019, then-CEO Hilary Schneider wrote an open letter addressing the negative sentiment around the company's customer care and said Wag was ""revisiting and reviewing"" its customer service systems.
