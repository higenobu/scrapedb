12/15/2021,"The sister of one of the Amazon warehouse tornado victims said the company failed its employees. ""The richest company in the world can't keep their employees safe,"" she told Insider. Clayton Cope was one of six workers killed after a tornado hit a company warehouse in Illinois. The sister of one of the Amazon workers who was killed when a tornado ripped through a company warehouse in Illinois said Tuesday she was furious that the trillion-dollar e-commerce giant couldn't keep its employees safe. ""I'm angry,"" Rachel Cope, the 28-year-old sister of Clayton Cope, 29, told Insider. ""The richest company in the world can't keep their employees safe."" She added: ""That's just disgusting.""  Deadly tornadoes touched down across the Midwest, destroying communities. One of the hardest hit was Mayfield, Kentucky, where homes, factories, and churches totally collapsed. Clayton Cope, a US Navy veteran and maintenance mechanic for Amazon, was one of the six employees killed after a tornado devastated a massive delivery site in Edwardsville, Illinois, on Friday night and caused the roof of the building to collapse.  All Amazon ""cared about was making sure that people's Christmas presents got delivered,"" Rachel Cope said. Clayton Cope was in contact with his dad — who works at the same Amazon warehouse but was not working that night — after the first tornado sirens went off shortly after 8 p.m. Friday, his sister said. Rachel Cope said her dad spoke with her brother on the phone and told him get to the shelter inside of the 1.1 million-square-foot warehouse. She added that Clayton Cope initially refused because he said he wanted to warn others of the looming danger.  She said: ""My brother was saying, 'No, there's a ton of drivers that are coming back, and I need to go warn them to get inside and get to the shelter because they don't know where to go.'"" Shortly afterward, the building collapsed. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider on Tuesday but said in a previous statement that management at the Edwardsville facility ""acted incredibly quickly"" to get workers into a designated ground-level shelter at the site.  ""There was a small group who took shelter in a part of the building that was then directly impacted by the tornado, and this is where most of the tragic loss of life occurred,"" the company said.  Employees had just minutes of warning before the roof of the building collapsed, the company said. A manager who survived the disaster told the Cope family that he saw Clayton ""physically helping people get to the shelter"" amid a ""frantic"" situation before the tornado hit, Rachel Cope said.  ""My brother was a hero,"" she said. ""He was a really, really, really good guy. He was the kind of guy that would do anything for anybody."" Rachel Cope, who said she previously worked at a nearby Amazon warehouse for over a year, said the company should have been better prepared. ""They're a company that is known for not caring about their employees,"" she said, adding that Amazon treated its employees as ""replaceable."" ""And that's how they'll feel about my brother,"" she said. ""They'll feel he's replaceable. They don't care.""

12/15/2021,"Billionaire Elon Musk replied to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's critique of his tax-paying habits on Tuesday. He said that the senator reminded him of a friend's ""angry Mom"" who would ""randomly yell at everyone for no reason."" ProPublica previously reported that Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018. TIME person of the year and richest man in the world Elon Musk took to Twitter on Tuesday to respond to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's critique of his tax-paying habits and push for policy changes. ""Let's change the rigged tax code so The Person of the Year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else,"" Warren initially wrote on Twitter. In his latest response, Musk wrote: ""You remind me of when I was a kid and my friend's angry Mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason."" Warren is indeed a mother, as well as a Harvard Law School professor and leading progressive voice. He did not mention anything about tax proposals. A recent ProPublica investigation found that the billionaire, who is currently worth over $250 billion, paid no federal income taxes in 2018. Policymakers like Warren have been pushing for new tax measures that would target the net worths and assets of billionaires like Musk, who are able to use perfectly legal methods to not be on the hook for federal income taxes. It was the latest insult that Musk lobbed at Senate Democrats in recent weeks. He previously took aim at Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon with a crude insult. Wyden was the chief author of a billionaire's income tax plan that would have slapped Musk with an estimated $10 billion annual tax bill. Musk also disparaged Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a prominent lawmaker who has aggressively advocated to tax the wealthiest Americans and large firms. ""I keep forgetting that you're still alive,"" Musk wrote on Twitter. And Musk also assailed President Joe Biden's $2 trillion social and climate spending plan, arguing Democrats should ""just can the whole thing."" He's opposed to federal subsidies for electric vehicle charging stations. In his interview with TIME, Musk said that he thinks ""the government is inherently not a good steward of capital"" — although he's received government subsidies for various business ventures.  ""In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness,"" Musk said in one Twitter reply in September. Then, he added: ""That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.""

12/15/2021,"By Eric Beech WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday dismissed a bid by former President Donald Trump to keep his tax returns from a House of Representatives committee, ruling that Congress' legislative interest outweighed any deference Trump should receive as a former president. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden said in his ruling that Trump was ""wrong on the law"" in seeking to block the House Ways and Means Committee from obtaining his tax returns. McFadden, who also said it was within the power of the committee's chairman to publish the returns if he saw fit, put his ruling on hold for 14 days, allowing time for an appeal. Trump was the first president in 40 years not to release his tax returns as he aimed to keep secret the details of his wealth and the activities of his family company, the Trump Organization. The committee sued in 2019 to force disclosure of the tax returns, and the dispute lingers nearly 11 months after Trump left office. Trump lawyer Patrick Strawbridge told McFadden last month the committee had no legitimate reason to see the tax returns and had asked for them in the hope of uncovering information that could hurt Trump politically. House Democrats have said they need Trump's tax returns to see if the Internal Revenue Service is properly auditing presidential returns in general and to assess whether new legislation is needed. McFadden, a Trump appointee, said the committee would be able to accomplish its stated objective without publishing the returns. He cautioned the panel's Democratic chairman, Representative Richard Neal, that while he has the right to do so, ""anyone can see that publishing confidential tax information of a political rival is the type of move that will return to plague the inventor."" Neither the committee nor Strawbridge immediately responded to requests for comments on the ruling.

12/15/2021,"As condemnations and calls to resign mount for Lafayette City Court Judge Michelle Odinet over use of a racist slur in a video taken at her house, the judge likely won’t lose her seat unless she resigns. Multiple people were recorded using a racist slur in a video over the weekend, which the judge confirmed was taken at her home following a failed burglary attempt early Saturday morning. The video does not show any of the speakers heard during the clip, but multiple voices repeatedly say “n-----” while watching footage of the attempted burglary. ""Mom's yelling, n-----, n-----,"" a male voice says, recounting the incident while watching the security footage. ""We have a n-----. It's a n-----, like a roach,"" a female voice adds. In a statement to The Daily Advertiser Tuesday, Odinet said her family was the victim of an armed burglary, but a spokesperson for the Lafayette Police Department said Tuesday there was no indication that the suspect had a weapon. CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support local journalists like Andrew Capps nullOdinet, who was elected to the bench just more than a year ago, has four children and is married to Lafayette Parish Coroner Kenneth Odinet Jr. Since the video was first reported by the Current Monday, condemnations of Odinet and calls for her to resign have mounted, starting with local NAACP President Michael Toussaint, who told KLFY Monday night that “hate, in any form, cannot stand and must be condemned.” “One would think that as a sitting judge, a mother, a community leader, a person in position of authority, that she would have stepped up and taken a stand against that type of language in her own home,” Toussaint said. Toussaint’s call for Odinet’s resignation was echoed by Louisiana Democratic Party Chair Katie Bernhardt Tuesday morning. “The citizens of Lafayette deserve to have confidence in our judicial system — that will not happen while she is on the bench,” Bernhardt wrote in a statement. “We will not tolerate bigotry from the bench. Fairness and impartiality cannot coexist with racism; Lafayette needs a new judge,” she added. The Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus also called on Odinet to resign Tuesday, with Chairman Edward ""Ted"" James saying ""it does not matter that she was in her private capacity, as black a robe can never hide what's obviously in her heart."" ""A sitting Judge should not use any racial slurs or show bias against any specific group of individuals,"" said James said. State Rep. Vincent Pierre, D-Lafayette, added to the caucus' call for Odinet's resignation by insisting ""the citizens of Lafayette deserve to have confidence in the judicial system."" ""Over half of those that go before city court judges are African Americans who have no confidence in Odinet's ability to rule fairly,"" Pierre said. City Marshal Reggie Thomas, the first Black official elected to citywide office in Lafayette, also condemned condemned Odinet Tuesday, saying her “mere ineffectual and weak apology will not suffice.” ""It is up to Judge Odinet to remember the oath she took, and should she remain on the bench, find a way to gain back the trust of 'all' of Lafayette, especially African Americans,"" Thomas said. State Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, called the video “reprehensible, offensive and totally unacceptable from anyone serving as a judge.” “The comments fail to identify any form of lamentation and cast a cloud relative to the impartiality of the judge to serve as an unbiased arbitrator in cases involving African Americans,” he said. Boudreaux and the LLBC arealso asking the Judicial Commission of Louisiana, which oversees the conduct and punishment of elected judges, to investigate the incident. But efforts to remove Odinet from the City Court bench likely face an uphill battle. Judges are unique in Louisiana in that they are the only elected officials who are protected from recall petitions. Other elected officials can be recalled if a number of registered voters sign a petition calling for a recall election. But state law specifically exempts judges from being subject to such petitions. Only the Louisiana Supreme Court can remove an elected judge from the bench following an investigation by the state’s Judicial Commission, which can take several months or even years. State law authorizes the state Supreme Court to “censure, suspend with or without salary, remove from office, or retire involuntarily a judge for … persistent and public conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.” The law’s requirement that such conduct be “persistent” could make any case to remove Odinet a long shot, unless more instances similar to the racist slur used in the video come to light. Odinet did not respond when asked whether she would resign Tuesday morning. Follow Andrew Capps on Twitter or send an email to acapps@theadvertiser.com.
