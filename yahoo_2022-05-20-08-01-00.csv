5/20/2022,"The market is in full panic mode. The S&P 500 is down 18% year to date. The Nasdaq is down a staggering 27%. And even the Dow Jones — made up of the 30 most prominent publicly-traded companies — is in correction territory. According to Bank of America, there’s one thing that might save the stock market in 2022: money that corporations can return to shareholders. “The best hope for 2022 bulls lies in the ability of investors to dislodge the $7.1 trillion in idle U.S. corporate cash,” the bank writes in a note to investors. Bank of America forecasts that share repurchases and dividends in the U.S. — currently at a 12-year low — will likely go up moving forward. “We expect companies to face pressure to compete for shareholders by increasing dividends and buybacks due to low profit growth, declining productivity, and decreased prospects for profitable [capital expenditures].” In order to take advantage of a potential payout increase, Bank of America suggests ETFs that focus on dividends, buybacks, and free cash flow. Here’s a look a three to get you started. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. A lot of companies pay dividends, but some are more generous than others. If you want to invest in a portfolio of companies that are characterized by oversized payouts, consider the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF. The fund takes a passive, full replication approach to track the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. It holds 443 stocks, so it is well diversified. The ETF’s top holdings include household names like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) — companies that have been paying increasing dividends for decades. VYM also boasts a very low expense ratio of 0.06%. Paying dividends isn’t the only way to return cash to investors. Companies can also repurchase their shares. When a company buys back its stock, it reduces the number of shares outstanding, allowing each remaining investor to own a larger portion of the business. If you want to follow the buyback theme, look into the iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF. The fund tracks the Morningstar US Dividend and Buyback Index, which consists of companies with a history of dividends and share repurchases. Its expense ratio is 0.25%. Right now, DIVB holds 319 stocks, with its three top holdings being Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (FB). In 2021, Apple spent $88.3 billion on buybacks, Microsoft spent $29.2 billion, and Meta bought back $50.1 billion of its own shares. Free cash flow represents the money a company generates after all expenses — including capital expenditures — are paid. If a company generates a lot of free cash flow, it’s typically in a good position to return cash to investors. That’s why the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF is a potentially timely opportunity. The fund is based on the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 Index, which screens the Russell 1000 Index to arrive at 100 companies with the highest free cash flow yield. Currently, its top three holdings are Valero Energy (VLO), Dow (DOW), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). The index is reconstituted and rebalanced on a quarterly basis. COWZ has an expense ratio of 0.49%.

5/20/2022,"Twitter is shedding both stock and executives, as the Elon Musk takeover drama continues to shake up the company. Musk might be seriously thinking about backing out of his $44 billion Twitter takeover deal, but several of the company’s higher-ups are done with the drama. Three senior executives at the company, including two vice presidents, left Twitter this week, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed their departures to Bloomberg; they reportedly left the company of their own volition. Last week, CEO Parag Agrawal announced in an email to employees that two top-level company leaders in the consumer product and revenue departments were departing. Both employees later said on their Twitter accounts that they had been fired. Twitter shares are down about 18% in the past five days when the executive departures came to light. Musk has said that a lower bid for the company is “not out of the question” and that he might renegotiate the takeover price. Speculation that he could pull out of the deal has already erased most of the gains since Twitter’s stock began rising last month, and a gap is widening between the company’s current value and Musk’s original proposition, with his comments about renegotiating rising in proportion. Musk’s now contractually committed Twitter bid was worth $54.20 per share. On Wednesday, Twitter shares were worth $36.85. The executive departures come amid a wave of hiring freezes and rescinded job offers as Twitter reevaluates its labor costs. In his letter to employees last week, Agrawal said the company was not on track to hit revenue and user growth targets it set last year, which included doubling its revenue and having 315 million “monetizable daily active users” by the end of 2023. The CEO assured staff that Twitter was not planning on any companywide layoffs. Twitter is also cutting costs for its marketing department, contractors and consultants, travel and events, and its real estate expenses, among “other operational costs,” Agrawal wrote. The confusion surrounding Twitter’s management, and the uncertainty over what Elon Musk will actually do when or if he ever completes his takeover bid, has sent the company’s stock rolling in recent days, with Twitter down 20% from last week. Musk has so far done little to help clear up the company’s fickle management situation. The prospective Twitter owner has repeatedly taken to the platform to criticize executives, eliciting strong reactions from current Twitter employees. Last week, Musk threw the Twitter management situation into even more disarray when he announced that the takeover deal was “on hold” until he got more information from Agrawal about how many bot accounts the social media site actually has, claiming that the company could be vastly underreporting the number of spam or fake profiles proliferating the platform. Twitter employees have said that Musk is treating the company “like a dog playing with a toy,” and many have expressed alarm over how the prospective owner’s actions are beginning to push down the company’s value, before the takeover bid is even completed.

5/20/2022,"(Updates with details about other changes to the sustainability index, and criticism that ESG ratings conflate too many issues) By Ross Kerber and Hyunjoo Jin May 18 (Reuters) - An S&P Dow Jones Indices executive told Reuters on Wednesday it has removed electric carmaker Tesla Inc from the widely followed S&P 500 ESG Index because of issues including claims of racial discrimination and crashes linked to its autopilot vehicles, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded with harsh tweets including that ""ESG is a scam"". In it changes, effective May 2, the sustainability index also added soon-to-be-Musk-controlled Twitter Inc and oil refiner Phillips 66 while dropping Delta Air Lines and Chevron Corp, according to an announcement. The back-and-forth over the index changes reflects a wider debate about the metrics used to judge corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, a growing area of investing. Tesla has become the most valuable auto industry company by pioneering EVs and expanding into battery storage for electric grids and solar-power systems. Factors contributing to its departure from the index included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices' head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview. Even though Tesla's products help cut planet-warming emissions, Dorn said, its other issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. ""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said. Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. The company has previously called ESG methodologies ""fundamentally flawed."" Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526958110023245829 that ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors."" Asked about the tweet, a representative for the index provider said Musk may have been referring to a list on a company blog post https://www.indexologyblog.com/2022/05/17/the-rebalancing-act-of-the-sp-500-esg-index of the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after the removal of Tesla and others. The list is ""not a ranking of best companies by ESG score,"" the representative said. Exxon now accounts for 1.443% of the weight of the index. Apple Inc was the largest at 9.657%. GROWING CONCERNS Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured billions of dollars into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting debate about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they push companies too much on issues that should be settled by government policy. S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. Musk and others have complained the firm and its rivals conflate too many issues by bundling ESG concerns into one total score. For instance a fund based on the S&P 500 ESG Index, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF, received the low rating ""D"" by climate activist research group As You Sow, which noted despite its title and sustainability mandate, fossil fuel stocks make up 6.5% of fund assets. In the company blog post reviewing changes from April 22, S&P's Dorn said the index aims to keep industries weighted the same as they are in the regular S&P 500 index ""while enhancing the overall sustainability profile of the index."" In practice that means it can keep oil companies while leaving out big players like Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Wells Fargo & Co. Dorn said Tesla's ESG score had declined slightly from the ""22"" it received last year. At the same time the average score among other automakers improved, pushing Tesla out of the ESG index because of a rule against including lowest-quartile performers. Dorn and others did not immediately describe other details such as the reasons Twitter or Phillips 66 were added or other companies dropped. Among other big ESG ratings agencies, MSCI Inc gives Tesla an ""average"" ESG rating, while the Sustainalytics unit of Morningstar Inc gives Tesla a ""medium risk"" rating, according to the firms' websites. On Wednesday a U.S. safety regulator opened a special crash investigation into a Tesla crash this month in California, among more than 30 crashes under investigation involving advanced driver assistance systems. In February, a California state agency sued Tesla over allegations by Black workers that the company tolerated racial discrimination at an assembly plant, adding to claims made in several other lawsuits.

5/20/2022,"Wealthy people often are divided into two categories, high-net-worth individuals (HNWIS) who have at least $1 million in liquid assets and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIS) with $30 million and up. The definitions matter to the financial services industry, which targets different offerings to members of each group. Depending on which category they fall into, wealthy individuals need and have access to varying types of investment products and financial services. Let’s compare the key differences between both. A financial advisor can help optimize your investments to minimize your tax liability. HNWI Basics High net worth individuals (HNWIs) are generally defined as individuals who have at least $1 million in liquid assets. This means the person has that minimum amount combined in checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, stocks, bonds and other highly liquid assets. HNWI definitions don’t typically include less-liquid assets such as real estate, land and collectibles. And the liquid asset minimum has to be reached after deducting debt, so someone with $1 million in cash and securities and $500,000 in debt would not typically qualify. While the definition the financial services industry uses is not official and has no legal weight, the Securities and Exchange Commission has a definition that is official. The SEC uses the term “accredited investor” to describe individuals that meet specific requirements including at least one of the following: Possess professional certifications, designations or credentials demonstrating investment knowledge Have $1 million net worth, not including the value of the individual’s, primary residence Generate earned income of $200,000 each of the last two years. If combined with a spouse, the floor is $300,000. UHNWI Basics A UHNWI generally needs at least $30 million in net investable assets. This general definition is used by wealth managers, financial advisors and others in financial services to identify the richest segment of potential clients. Some definitions consider $10 million and up to be the domain of UHNWI. There’s no upper limit, so billionaires are categorized alongside these relatively less affluent worth tens of millions of dollars. Government regulators don’t use a UHNWI definition. A member of this group is treated like any other HNWI or accredited investor and has access to any legal investment opportunity. Why the Difference Matters Achieving the status of an HNWI makes a difference to the types of investments that are available. The SEC will not allow people who aren’t accredited investors to put their money into private equity funds, hedge funds and some other vehicles that are considered too complex or risky for less sophisticated and well-heeled investors. However, once you have reached the ranks of HNWI, it makes no difference to the SEC if your wealth continues to grow to UHNWI status. Financial services firms also target certain offerings to potential customers by wealth. For instance, HNWI customers may be able to get high-end credit cards such as the American Express Centurion Card. And the financial services industry pays still more-specialized attention to the UHNWI group. The difference between HNWI and UHNWI is most important to wealth managers, financial advisors, estate attorneys and others who serve the very affluent. Some restrict their practices to either HNWI or UHNWI clients, so they can limit the number of clients they serve and focus on the specialized services each group needs. High Net Worth Individual Needs An HNWI market is likely to be different from an UHNWI when it comes to investing, consuming, financial planning, tax planning and estate planning. For instance, a member of the HNWI group generally puts money into mainstream investments including domestic stocks and bonds, real estate and bank certificates of deposit. They are avid consumers of luxury goods such as luxury cars. As regards estate planning, they may employ trusts to simplify transfers of wealth and support charitable objectives. These individuals usually employ a single financial advisor to assist them in creating a financial plan and working with life insurance agents, securities brokers and other professionals to executive their financial vision.

Sign up today. Ultra-High Net Worth Individual Needs People in the UHNWI segment often have a team of financial planners and wealth managers as well as legal and tax experts to help with their more expansive and complex requirements. They may have a family office that operates like a private asset management firm while also addressing financial matters tied to lifestyle concerns like education, travel and art collections. They invest in more sophisticated, complex and risky investments, including private equity, hedge funds, precious metals, world markets, collectibles, and cryptocurrencies. Their consumption may lean toward experiences rather than possessions, and they are more likely to devote significant attention and resources to supporting charitable causes. Taxes are particular concern for an UHNWI, in part because their assets exceed the federal estate tax exemption, set for 2022 at $12.06 million for a couple. Only the wealthier HNWI is exposed to this tax. To manage inheritance taxes, the UHNWI is more likely to use private foundations, family limited partnerships and similar estate planning tools. Bottom Line The wealthy aren’t just unlike the rest of us; they also differ among themselves. High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) worth more than $1 million tend to have individual financial planners helping them put their money into mainstream investments, while Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWI) have teams of experts to direct investments in private equity, hedge funds and other risky and sophisticated investments. Tax planning, investment access and consumption patterns also vary among these classes of wealthy individuals Tips for Investing Your Money Knowing which investments are best for your portfolio can be a challenge, but a financial advisor can help you find the best investments to meet your goals. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

5/20/2022,"The debate over the cancellation of student debt has been going on for so long in America that reiterating the arguments pro and con no longer seems necessary. What may not be so well understood, however, is how incoherent the opposition arguments are. So we'll focus on that. First, a quick tour of the student loan landscape. The alternative to cancelling student debt is to wait 20 years and then cancel it after you've ruined someone's life. The government's not going to be repaid either way. Marshall Steinbaum, Jain Family Institute To begin with, the total amount of outstanding student loans for higher education has exploded over the last two decades. The sum owed by more than 45 million borrowers stands at about $1.8 trillion today, up from about $300 billion in 2000. The average balance owed by students on the day they graduate has soared faster than the general rate of inflation, to more than $36,000 in 2020 from about $18,200 in 2007, according to EducationData.org. That includes graduate and professional school graduates. Had the amount grown since 2007 at the same pace as the consumer price index it would be only $26,000 today. For undergrads, balances have grown even faster — from about $15,250 in 2007 to about $30,000 in 2020. Even students at public universities are graduating with sizable debt obligations, averaging more than $26,300. That many borrowers struggle to repay their loans is obvious. Federal data show that more than a third of all borrowers owe more on their loans 12 years after graduation than they originally borrowed due to the compounding of interest. In this category as in virtually every other, Black students are burdened the most — 66% of them owe more after 12 years than on commencement day. Obligations on this scale not only are a drag on economic growth — households burdened by high student debt tend to delay or forgo homeownership and face difficulties in starting a family or building up savings — but also mock Americans' most cherished assumptions about the value of higher education. ""The whole premise of the main higher education industry is that a college degree pays off,"" says Marshall Steinbaum, an expert in higher education finance at the Jain Family Institute. ""A substantial cancellation would belie that idea because why would we cancel all this debt when we said your incomes would go up enough to repay it?"" With these factors simmering on the front burner, pressure on the Biden administration to cancel sizable balances of student debt has intensified. The Trump and Biden administrations already gave borrowers a great deal of relief by placing all federally backed student loans (well more than 90% of the total) in forbearance during the pandemic, that is since March 2020. From then through this August, borrowers don't have to make principal payments on those loans and interest doesn't accrue on the unpaid balances. Analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an aerie for deficit hawks, have estimated that the repayment pause was tantamount to granting the average borrower $5,500 in debt cancellation as of May 1. For some reason, the committee thinks this is scandalous. Anyway, during his presidential campaign, President Biden endorsed canceling up to $10,000 in debt per borrower. Democrats in Congress, notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York, are pressing for cancellation of as much as $50,000. Now let's look at the most common arguments against student loan cancellation and examine why they don't hold water. First up is the argument that canceling existing debt would be unfair to all those who already paid off their loans. As I've explained in the past, this is the argument from pure selfishness and a formula for permanent governmental paralysis. It's a favorite among conservatives and those whose comfortable affluence makes them insensitive to the burdens of others. Back in 2020 GOP operative Matthew Dowd remarked in a since-deleted tweet, ""I paid for my college by working and i took out student loans which I paid back in less than ten years by scrimping on other things. Why is it fair that we just cancel all student loan debt?"" Similarly, in responding to a survey of economists conducted that year by the University of Chicago, David Autor of MIT commented, “Alongside my kids’ student loans, I’d like the government to pay off my mortgage. If the latter idea shocks you, the first one should too."" The truth, of course, is that in a healthy society government policy moves ahead by taking note of existing inequities and striving to address them. Following the implications of the ""I paid, why shouldn't you"" camp to their natural conclusion means that we wouldn't have Social Security, Medicare or the Affordable Care Act today. Those programs were all designed to relieve Americans of what Franklin Roosevelt called ""the hazards and vicissitudes of life."" Is it really sensible to say that we shouldn't have them because before their enactment seniors were left to starve and suffer illness without assistance, and some families needed to buy health coverage in an individual market that was closed to those with medical conditions or grotesquely overpriced? As Warren responded during her 2020 presidential campaign to a voter who raised this objection, ""Look, we build a future going forward by making it better. By that same logic, what would we have done, not started Social Security because we didn’t start it last week for you or last month for you?” That we're hearing this argument more these days may have something to do with general economic inequality. As economist Benjamin Friedman has written, “America has made progress mostly when living standards for the majority of the nation’s citizens are advancing.... The opposite has been true when incomes have stagnated or fallen.” The latter environment, Friedman observed, produces ""intolerant, anti-democratic and ungenerous behavior — racial and religious discrimination, antipathy toward immigrants, lack of generosity toward the poor.” Sound familiar? It's proper to remember that higher education was not always as expensive or economically exclusive as it is today. Tuition at the University of California was free from its founding in the 1860s and reaffirmed in the state's 1960 master plan for public higher education, which acknowledged the university’s role as a driver of economic growth. Raising the instructional costs for students, the master plan said, would negate “the whole concept of wide-spread educational opportunity made possible by the state university idea.” Free tuition disappeared in 1970, when an ""education fee"" — tuition by another name — was instituted at $150 a year. The system and state never looked back. UC tuition today is $13,104 for residents and $44,130 for nonresidents, and constitutes the ""largest single source of core operating funds"" for the university. While it lasted, free tuition at UC was a source of immeasurable intellectual wealth for the state. Among those who partook of the system were former governor and U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren, diplomat Ralph Bunche, the late L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley, and writer Maxine Hong Kingston, all children of low-income families. If UC were to reinstitute free tuition — a change that would cost about $5.3 billion based on this year's university budget — would all those who had to pay for their UC education think they had been rooked? Or would they look ahead to the gains for the state more generally? The second major argument against debt cancellation is that it would disproportionately benefit the rich. The foundation of the argument is that wealthier households carry more debt than low-income households, so they would gain more from reducing their balances. In other words, cancellation would be regressive. This notion has been effectively debunked by scholars at the Brookings Institution and the Roosevelt Institute. Those from the latter calculate that ""the largest share of debt cancellation dollars goes to people with the least wealth."" Specifically, the average person in the 20th to 40th percentiles for household assets would receive ""more than four times as much debt cancellation as the average person in the top 10%, and twice as much debt cancellation as people in the 80th to 90th percentiles."" (For reference, according to the Federal Reserve, average net worth for households in the 20th to 40th percentile range is about $6,368 to $67,470; the 80th percentile starts at $558,200 and the 90th at $1.2 million.) The Roosevelt Institute's experts observe that the notion of a big giveaway to the wealthy is based on calculating the effect of cancellation only on borrowers at every wealth level, rather than basing the calculation on all households. That makes cancellation appear to be regressive because ""high-income and high-wealth households that carry student debt tend to carry it in large quantities."" Most of those households, however, have no student debt, so the benefits of cancellation to rich households overall are relatively small. Under Warren and Schumer's proposal, the Roosevelt Institute says, estimated debt cancellation of $50,000 would come to only $562 per person, including non-borrowers, in the top 10% of households. But it would come to $17,366 per person for all Black households and $12,617 for white households in the bottom 10% for net worth. Andre Perry and Carl Romer of Brookings, in collaboration with Steinbaum, demonstrated last year that student debt cancellation would help to narrow the wealth gap between Black and white households. In part that's because Black families are more likely than white families to finance their higher education with debt. As a result, student loans become yet another obstacle to wealth creation by Black families, as is seen by the fact that ""Black people with a college degree have lower homeownership rates than white high school dropouts."" White families have greater capability than Black families to fund tax-advantaged college savings accounts such as 529 accounts from current income, another factor that forces Black families into college debt. The most overlooked factor in student debt is that some portion of it is destined to be forgiven anyway, just not immediately or all at once. Those are balances subject to income-driven repayment plans, in which about one-third of all borrowers are enrolled. Those plans set payments at a given percentage of the borrower's income and provide for cancellation of any remaining balance after 20 or 25 years (depending on the program and the nature of the loan). IDRs, as they're known, have been around since the 1990s. They aren't more popular because they haven't been adequately marketed and are still optional; advocates say they should be made the default choice for all borrowers. Because the required payments often are not enough to cover accruing interest, the loan balances tend to increase over time until the cancellation date is reached — a prospect that may discourage some borrowers from signing up. Yet the implications of IDRs is almost universally overlooked in the student debt debate. These plans are ""de facto student debt cancellation,"" Steinbaum told me. With IDRs, he notes, ""the alternative to canceling student debt is to wait 20 years and then cancel it after you've ruined someone's life. The government's not going to be repaid either way."" That should place the debate on a different footing. Government policy aimed at steering more borrowers into income-driven repayment amounts to an acknowledgment that its loans will be, and should be, canceled. So why wait? Let's do it now. The longer the debate drags on, the longer the student debt overhang will widen the gap between rich and poor and Black and white, and the more the value of higher education will come into question. That won't be good for anybody.

5/20/2022,"Inflation started taking off last year and is now near 40-year highs. Last week, the world’s major central banks took a pivot toward an anti-inflationary policy stance, bumping up interest rates in a move that was expected but also a cause for concern. While the prospect of central bank action to tame inflation is a net positive, the required interest rate bumps could also push the economy into recession. In the meantime, investors are busy waiting. Waiting for the next Fed move, and waiting for the next data release, and waiting to see what will happen in the coming months. According to Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, ""If we've seen the worst of the rate of change from long-term interest rates, it may create room for equities to do a little bit better.” Taking this into consideration, our attention turned to two stocks that Wells Fargo thinks have solid growth prospects, with the firm’s analysts forecasting at least 50% upside potential for each. Using TipRanks’ database, we found out both tickers also sport a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the rest of the Street. Let's take a closer look. Match Group (MTCH) The first Wells Fargo pick is a Texas-based company in the online dating field, Match Group. This tech firm owns and operates an active portfolio of online dating and matching services, including leading names like Tinder, Match.com, and OKCupid. Match Group boasts an enormous reach, from the online world to the real world, with apps that have been downloaded over 750 million times – and with 40% of all interpersonal relationships in the US starting online, Match Group’s total addressable market is substantial. While Match Group has had a long run of success, the company is now coping with coming changes. Earlier this month, the company announce that long-time CEO Shar Dubey is resigning after 16 years of service. Dubey will be succeeded by Bernard Kim, who comes to Match Group from the social gaming firm Zynga. Match Group controls the highest grossing, most downloaded dating app in the world, Tinder, and that is reflected in the company’s top line. At $799 million, the top line was up 20% year-over-year for 1Q22, a quarter which the company admitted was impacted by both COVID and the Russia-Ukraine war. The company saw an overall increase of 13% in total payers, to 16.3 million, a gain that was driven by the 34% increase in the Asia Pacific region. The company finished Q1 with a strong balance sheet, holding $921 million in cash and liquid assets. Despite Tinder's widespread use and success, the company’s stock is down 45% this year. However, 5-star analyst Brian Fitzgerald, of Wells Fargo, is not overly worried, and paints an upbeat picture of Match Group's prospects in the long term. “MTCH for the first time disclosed companywide MAU, pushing back on recent bear thesis (fueled by third-party app data of questionable accuracy) on declining user engagement. While we expect crosswinds to continue (likely for multiple quarters), we view fundamental opportunity as very much intact and valuation as compelling at current levels,"" Fitzgerald opined. What this adds up to for Fitzgerald is a stock that deserves an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating. The Wells Fargo analyst also sets a price target of $115, suggesting an upside of ~58% going forward. (To watch Fitzgerald’s track record, click here) Tech firms of Match Group’s size don’t lack for Wall Street attention, and MTCH shares have 17 analyst reviews on record. These include 15 Buys and 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The $119.59 average price target implies ~64% one-year upside from the current trading price of $73.07. (See MTCH stock forecast on TipRanks) MaxLinear, Inc. (MXL) Now we’ll shift our attention to a semiconductor chip company, a resident of the niche that quite literally makes the digital world go ‘round. MaxLinear is a designer and distributor of integrated radio-frequency analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, chips used in applications from automotive and industrial connectivity to wireless access and ethernet switches to router and extender hardware. MaxLinear’s products have also found wide use in the continuing rollout of 5G infrastructure systems. That alone would give this company a solid position in the chip world – but MaxLinear recently took a step to firm up that position. On May 5, the company announced that it will be acquiring fellow chip firm Silicon Motion. The combination of the two firms will create an entity with a combined revenue exceeding $2 billion, a total addressable market worth $15 billion, and instant entry into the ranks of the ten largest fabless chip suppliers. The transaction is expected to close in 1H23, and will value Silicon Motion at $3.8 billion, to be paid in both cash and stock. Shortly before making the merger announcement, MaxLinear announced financial results for 1Q22. At the top line, quarterly revenue hit a record level of $263.9 million, up 26% year-over-year. On earnings, the company’s non-GAAP EPS jumped from 55 cents in the year-ago quarter to $1 in this latest report. And, the company finished the quarter with a net cash flow of $132.2 million, up leaps and bounds from the $40 million in 1Q21 and the $16 million 4Q21. MaxLinear guided toward $275 million to $285 million in revenue for 2Q22, a sequential gain of 6% at the midpoint. That guidance, of course, came before the Silicon Motion acquisition announcement. Looking at the Silicon Motion deal, Wells Fargo's 5-star analyst Gary Mobley writes: “While initial investor reaction has been negative, we view this deal as a long term opportunity for MXL. While investors don't always react favorably to financially engineering EPS accretion (e.g., resulting EPS accretion doesn't always get market valuation multiples), we view this MXL+SIMO transaction as one that enhances shareholder value.” Unfortunately for investors, MaxLinear stock has been falling, and is down 46% year-to-date. However, Mobley remains upbeat regarding the company's prospects, writing: ""We are more bullish on the MXL story as shares have traded off to a point at which we have to say shares are grossly undervalued... We also like the fact that MXL's rev has little direct correlation w/ direct consumer spending & is more tied to telco, cable MSO & data center cap ex, more durable areas in the current macro backdrop.” Based on the above, Mobley rates MXL shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets a price target of $66, indicating his belief in ~63% upside this year. (To watch Mobley’s track record, click here) All in all, Wall Street clearly likes what it sees in MXL, because the stock has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 7 positive reviews. The stock is priced at $40.51 and its $63 average price target suggests it has an upside of ~55% in the next 12 months.

5/20/2022,"Despite bitcoin’s violent sell off, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor is holding firm. The bitcoin bull said he’s in it for the long term and his strategy is to buy and hold the cryptocurrency. “There's no price target,” Saylor told Yahoo Finance Live. “I expect we'll be buying bitcoin at the local top forever. And I expect bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So we're very patient. We think it's the future of money.” Saylor said bitcoin has sold off with other risk assets like stocks as the Federal Reserve has moved to raise interest rates, and investors have sold off riskier assets or assets with valuations that had soared. That, Saylor said, is separate from the meltdown of stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token Luna, which he thinks will accelerate efforts to regulate stablecoins and security tokens. “That’ll be good for the industry,” he said. “Over time, I think as people get educated and as they get more comfortable, I think we'll recover from this drawdown.” On the back of the meltdown in Terra, Saylor said regulators are going to accelerate their regulation of stablecoins and crypto security tokens and that the winner will ultimately be bitcoin. “Once people figure out why bitcoin is superior to everything else, then the institutions are going to come in with large sums of money, and we're not going to have to struggle through this massive explanation of why we're different than 19,000 other crypto tokens,” he said. Saylor also thinks that since most cryptocurrencies aren’t registered securities, that’s preventing public companies and investors from investing in them and holding back the asset class as a whole. While Saylor believes bitcoin is the future of money, he thinks Lightning—a network applied to bitcoin that enables the cryptocurrency to scale up its ability to do transactions more efficiently— is the future of payments. “If you're going to do payments and transactions high speed, you're going to need a base layer that's ethically sound, economically sound, and technically sound,” he said. “That's what Bitcoin is. But then billions and billions of transactions are going to go on a layer 2 like Lightning.” Jennifer Schonberger covers cryptocurrencies and policy for Yahoo Finance. Follow her at @Jenniferisms.

5/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A benchmark ESG stock index has removed Tesla Inc., sparking a debate about which companies do — and don’t — pass muster with socially aware investors. Most Read from Bloomberg Target and Walmart’s Deep Pain Could Be Your Gain Walmart Flashes a Warning Sign to the Entire Consumer Economy One of the World’s Frothiest Housing Markets Turned Into a Seller’s Headache Overnight Plotkin Shuts Melvin Hedge Fund Reeling From Redditor Attack China in Talks With Russia to Buy Oil for Strategic Reserves Tesla has grown into a $735 billion company on the back of its breakthrough electric-vehicle engineering. Its own carbon footprint is a small fraction of its peers, and its success in the market has pushed the industry overall away from gas-powered vehicles. But the other components of ESG — the social and governance risks — give investors pause. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is an unconventional manager, prone to impulsive tweeting, and the company discloses very little information about its workforce or labor conditions. That split became material Wednesday after it emerged that Tesla was expelled from the ESG version of the S&P 500 Index. Musk responded by saying ESG is “a scam.” It added to an already bad day for the company, whose stock fell 6.8% amid a broad selloff in tech shares. “This all speaks to the big inconvenient fact about ESG: You can’t keep the baby and throw out the bathwater,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “You have to accept or reject both.” Read more: ESG Investing Is Mostly About Sustaining Corporations In a report, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence wrote that Tesla’s ESG status remains among the most debated for any company, with many ESG-labeled funds still holding the stock. In fact, the world’s largest ESG-focused exchange-traded fund has about 1.8% of its assets invested in Tesla, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund, BlackRock Inc.’s $21.9 billion iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ticker ESGU), tracks the MSCI USA Extended ESG Focus Index, which still includes Tesla as a member. Balchunas and BI’s Shaheen Contractor wrote Wednesday that eight of the 15 largest US funds that include ESG in their portfolio filters have significant positions in Tesla. “Though Tesla might fit an environmental focus or impact theme, the company’s social and governance issues make its inclusion in ESG funds debatable and Tesla’s removal from the S&P 500 ESG Index perhaps overdue,” the analysts said in their posting entitled “Is Tesla ESG?” S&P Dow Jones Indices, which removed Tesla from its S&P 500 ESG Index, said the company’s score on environmental, social and governance standards has remained “fairly stable” over the past year, but it has slipped down the ranks against improving global peers. The index provider cited concerns related to working conditions and Tesla’s handling of an investigation into deaths and injuries linked to its driver-assistance systems. A lack of low-carbon strategy and codes of business conduct also counted against Musk’s company, it said. “While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” Margaret Dorn, senior director and head of ESG indexes for S&P Dow Jones in North America, said in a Tuesday blog post. Read more: Tesla Loses S&P ESG Index Spot on Crashes, Work Conditions For months now, Tesla has been critical of ESG. The company said in its annual report that ESG ratings are “fundamentally flawed,” and in an April tweet, Musk said “corporate ESG is the devil incarnate.” From a market standpoint, Tesla’s removal from the S&P index probably will be minimal as there was only about $11.7 billion that tracked S&P ESG gauges as recently as the end of 2020. By contrast, trillions of dollars track the main S&P 500 gauge. Investors are split on S&P’s decision. Kristin Hull, founder of Nia Impact Capital, a sustainability fund in Oakland, California, that has been pressing Tesla to address worker issues, said she was relieved that there was “finally accountability.” Zach Stein, chief investment officer of Carbon Collective, a climate-change focused online investment adviser based in Berkeley, California, said the opposite. The biggest issue in ESG is climate change, so kicking out the leading maker of electric vehicles makes no sense, especially since companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. remain in the S&P index, he said.

5/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. executives told employees on Thursday that the $44 billion deal to sell the company to billionaire Elon Musk is moving forward as planned, and that they won’t renegotiate the agreed-upon price of $54.20 per share. Most Read from Bloomberg One of the World’s Frothiest Housing Markets Turned Into a Seller’s Headache Overnight Target and Walmart’s Deep Pain Could Be Your Gain Walmart Flashes a Warning Sign to the Entire Consumer Economy China in Talks With Russia to Buy Oil for Strategic Reserves Plotkin Shuts Melvin Hedge Fund Reeling From Redditor Attack Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s top lawyer and head of policy, also told workers at an all-hands meeting that there is “no such thing as a deal being on hold,” according to people who attended the meeting. She was pushing back on claims from Musk over the past week that he is pausing the deal while he learns more about the number of bots and spam accounts on the social-media service. Twitter stock jumped about 2% on the news of the meeting, which was first reported by Bloomberg. Earlier the shares had declined by as much as 1.7%. Other top Twitter executives, including Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal and finance chief Ned Segal, also addressed employees, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal business. The companywide video call was intended for leadership to discuss the deal and provide more details following Twitter’s filing of its proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week, which outlined the transaction’s history and terms. Executives addressed a number of questions about the transaction, including whether Twitter would try and legally force Musk to buy the company based on his agreement. Gadde assured employees that Musk must “do everything he can” to make sure he gets his financing in order, and that it’s possible Twitter could try and “enforce” the terms of the deal “if we ever needed to do that in a court.” She added that getting to that step would be “pretty rare.” Musk earlier this week suggested he would be interested in renegotiating his deal for Twitter. The company’s stock is currently trading at $37.45 per share, well below the offer price. Thursday’s all-hands assembly was the latest in a string of internal meetings intended to help employees better understand the sales process. Segal discussed the gap in Twitter’s stock price and Musk’s offer, explaining to staff how this reflected some doubt that the deal would go through. He also said executives are still engaging with Musk and his team, and working with them “regularly” throughout the process to prepare for the possibilty of Musk taking over. Segal also discussed how Twitter’s board came to the decision to sell to Musk, which included an analysis of Twitter’s business projections if a deal didn’t happen. Gadde added that she believes Musk will be able to vote his shares at Twitter’s annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for May 25. The shareholder vote on whether to approve the deal will take place at a later date. Twitter has been in a state of limbo since the company’s board accepted an offer from Musk in late April. Musk has continued to criticize Twitter and its policies despite agreeing to the deal, and recently suggested the company was lying about the number of daily users that would be categorized as spam. He said the deal was “on hold” until he got more information. After Agrawal posted a long thread earlier this week explaining Twitter’s methodology for counting spam accounts, Musk replied to the CEO with a poop emoji.

5/20/2022,"2022 has been hard going for many industries operating against a backdrop of inflation running hot and rising interest rates. The negative macro developments affected all corners of Sundial’s (SNDL) latest quarterly report. The Canadian cannabis company dialed in total net revenue of C$17.6 million, amounting to a ~29% sequential drop, as seasonal slower sales hit the top-line. Net cannabis cultivation dropped by 31% quarter-over-quarter to C$8.8 million as both wholesale and provincial distributor sales took a hit – falling by around 64% and 14% Q/Q, respectively. As the company postures toward the premium inhalables categories and moves away from discount offerings, Canaccord analyst Shaan Mir sees further “near-term challenges” for the business. “That said,” the analyst added, “we do believe that new product launches will help to drive modest sequential gains into provincial sales channels beginning in FQ2/22 (with 159 new product listings secured YTD).” Retail sales also dropped sequentially - by 24.5% from C$10.0 million in F4Q21 to ~C$7.5 million. The company presently boasts 183 cannabis retail locations in Canada, although going by previous noises made by management, given “retail saturation” in the majority of significant markets, Mir expects Sundial will “slow the pace” of store openings. On the bright side, Cash opex fell from C$13.1 million to C$11.9 million, a sequential improvement of 9%. However, put together with the weak top-line, “muted margin profile,” and reduced income from the company’s investment arm, adj. EBITDA showed a loss of (C$0.6 million) in the quarter compared to a profit of ~C$18.4 million in FQ4/21, and falling well short of Mir’s forecast of ~C$10 million. So, not much to shout about, as Mir reiterated a Hold rating and $0.6 price target. Still, investors will be locking in gains of 45% in a year’s time, should the figure be met. (To watch Mir’s track record, click here) Over the past 3 months, only one other analyst has reviewed SNDL’s prospects, and they agree with Mir’s prognosis, which gives the stock a Hold consensus rating. Combined with the Canaccord analyst’s objective, the average price target stands at $0.59, suggesting 12-month upside of 43%.

5/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- On a Dublin backstreet, behind a Georgian townhouse where the Irish Red Cross is raising funds to support Ukraine, a once-thriving hub of Russian finance is falling apart. Most Read from Bloomberg Target and Walmart’s Deep Pain Could Be Your Gain Walmart Flashes a Warning Sign to the Entire Consumer Economy Stocks Suffer Steepest Rout in Almost Two Years: Markets Wrap Plotkin Shuts Melvin Hedge Fund Reeling From Redditor Attack Musk Loses $12 Billion in a Day as He Tweets Politics, Slams ESG Here, a little-known firm quietly helped to keep Russia’s global money engine ticking over in recent years. Cafico International set up shell companies for some of the country’s biggest businesses, providing directors and accounts, helping them to sell bonds and raise billions of dollars. If Cafico’s services were discreet, its clients were anything but: corporations intertwined with President Vladimir Putin’s regime including VTB Bank and Russian Railways JSC, industrial powerhouses linked to oligarchs such as Oleg Deripaska and Roman Abramovich, and lenders systemic to the country’s economy like Sovcombank PJSC and Credit Bank of Moscow. Along with fellow corporate-service providers such as Amsterdam-based TMF Group and Hong Kong-based Vistra Group, Cafico is part of a network of invisible middlemen that helped Russian companies borrow at least $145 billion over the past decade, including after Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014. There’s about $65 billion outstanding, one third of which is linked to Cafico, according to a Bloomberg review of financial and regulatory filings. The numbers suggest that while Russia’s tycoons were known for splashing out on luxury real-estate in London and parties in Monaco, some of the vital mechanics of their empires was happening in a non-descript office building in Dublin. But the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has now upended the industry. Cafico’s customers have fallen under international sanctions, the bonds they and others arranged have plunged to pennies on the dollar, and banks are delaying, even blocking, payments as they try to stay on the right side of restrictions. With Russian business dealings now stigmatized, there’s also a spotlight on Ireland’s role facilitating the business. The issue has been raised in parliament debates, with some lawmakers referring to “dirty money” in Ireland, which has long battled accusations it’s a corporate tax haven. For their part, corporate-service providers are trying to extricate themselves and dump the Russian clients they once courted, something that’s easier said than done. The firms have expressed horror at the war -- Cafico says it’s counter to its values -- but critics of the industry have little sympathy. “Where were these values after the invasion of Crimea,” said Mairead Farrell, an Irish lawmaker with the opposition Sinn Fein party, who said Cafico had served a “disproportionate number” of Russian clients. “It’s too little, too late.” Money Trail Russian companies have been using empty shells for just over two decades to raise funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and the business barely skipped a beat after the 2014 Crimea invasion. By locating in Ireland, for example, they take advantage of regulatory regimes that international investors are more familiar with, while also benefiting from special tax breaks. The standalone entities -- known as special purpose vehicles, or SPVs -- can be used to issue securities called loan-participation notes that can be listed on local exchanges and sold to international investors, with the proceeds funneled back to their sponsors. And for the companies that set up such services, the business is a money-spinner. They’ll often have tens, if not hundreds, of SPVs on their books. Every entity will pay up to 20,000 euros ($21,000) in fees every year, estimates James Stewart, a professor in finance at Trinity College Dublin who has studied the sector. Russian companies have been huge users of SPVs and the LPN structure, the data analyzed by Bloomberg show. They raised more than twice as much in foreign currency through that process than other types of bonds over the past decade. According to Angela Gallo, a senior lecturer in finance at Bayes Business School in London, the figures suggest that they’ve become “the predominant type of access to foreign currency for Russian firms.” “SPVs are the infrastructure that allow capital to flow in and out of Russia,” she said. “Russian companies need to access global capital markets to raise funds and global investors need risks to improve their yields. Think of corporate service providers as bridges that allow parallel capital flows.” Rodney O’Rourke, an Irish lawyer who controls Cafico, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Yolanda Kelly, director of finance, declined to comment beyond a company statement in March. Meanwhile, firms that were hired to validate the shell companies’ accounts have started abandoning ship, with at least seven Irish-based SPVs receiving resignation letters since the invasion. KPMG, EisnerAmper, Mazars and Grant Thornton have walked away, with Grant Thornton citing concerns about falling foul of sanctions. European regulators were in the dark for years about the size of the SPV industry and who was behind transactions. When officials at the Central Bank of Ireland probed the sector in 2015, they discovered hundreds of opaque entities holding combined assets bigger than the country’s gross domestic product. Irish-based SPVs still hold about 37 billion euros of Russia-issued assets. Even before the war, critics questioned whether they were obscuring risks and wrongdoing. Credit Bank of Moscow used a Cafico vehicle to borrow billions of dollars despite being a close business partner of sanctioned state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Vneshprombank Ltd. borrowed $225 million through a Cafico SPV only to collapse in 2016 amid allegations that executives had pilfered its assets and falsified accounts. Tatfondbank PJSC, one of the country’s biggest regional banks, used an SPV arranged by TMF to sell $60 million of bonds just weeks before it imploded under a cloud of allegations. “Добро пожаловать в Cafico” Founded by O’Rourke in 2012, Cafico is barely known within Dublin business circles, while its Twitter account has fewer than 100 followers. Yet it’s actively courted Russian business for years, even running a Russian-language page at one point. The industry has attracted some deep-pocketed investors. U.K. private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners bought TMF for 1.8 billion euros in 2017. Warburg Pincus mulled a potential bid for Vistra late last year that would have valued it at up to $5 billion. Cafico is smaller but still lucrative. The firm had 4.5 million euros in shareholders’ funds at the end of 2020. But this steady income stream has now morphed into a nightmare. “Cafico has terminated and continues to terminate the provision of services to all Russia-linked clients,” it said in early March. At TMF, chief executive Mark Weil says the company did business with Russia over the past decade as it was “perfectly legal.” Now he wants to dump most of those customers and is bracing for a multi-million dollar hit mainly due to “walking away from revenue.” Last month, a Dublin-based SPV called PhosAgro Bond Funding DAC stated that it hadn’t made an interest payment to bondholders. The entity borrowed $1.5 billion through bond sales in recent years and dispatched the funds to PhosAgro PJSC, the Russian fertilizer giant controlled by sanctioned oligarch Andrey Guryev, who the U.K. describe as a “close associate” of Putin. In Luxembourg, the story is the same. This is the home of Steel Capital SA, a SPV linked to Severstal PJSC, the steel conglomerate controlled by sanctioned oligarch Alexey Mordashov. The entity, which is in technical default, is run by Vistra. Sylvia Evans, a spokesperson for Vistra, said the firm had “very limited business dealings with clients in Russia even before the Ukrainian crisis.” Similar notices have been landing thick and fast since March. Russian Railways owes billions through a Dublin-based SPV but says it can’t repay; an SPV tied to potash miner Uralkali PJSC, controlled by tycoon Dmitry Mazepin, says the same; Sovcombank, which borrowed $300 million as recently as November but is now under sanctions, has also struggled to make payments. And at the bottom of each notice: a Cafico-owned email address.

Yesterday, Target's (TGT) earnings were a huge whiff. The stock market did not care for this news, and equities across the board tanked with the S&P 500 turning in its worst day since June 2020. The overall concern: retailers are suggesting there's been a dramatic turn in the economic picture. But another issue reared its head in these reports — retailers have built a stockpile of products they may have to discount to move. “We ended up carrying too much inventory in several categories,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told investors on Wednesday. And when companies find themselves with too many kitchen appliances, TVs, and pieces of outdoor furniture, back rooms and warehouses that could be otherwise carrying food or personal care items end up getting crowded out. The choice: hold onto those bulky items, or sell them at a discount to make space. “We chose the latter, leading to incremental markdowns that reduced our gross margin,” Cornell said, adding that those were “difficult decisions.” The retail industry's bigger problem? This is not a Target-specific story. Walmart (WMT), which reported its own clunker of a quarter on Tuesday, said it needs another couple of quarters to “work through and sell through” excess inventory. Other retail stocks, like Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Costco, among others, fell sharply on Wednesday despite no earnings reports of their own, underscoring investor fears about the macroeconomic trends that could potentially weigh on their results in the coming quarters. The issue facing the industry is partly an echo of the pandemic, as big box retailers actively worked to expand inventory during 2021 as shuttered factories and materials shortages — and the Ever Given — led to empty shelves. Big box retailers resolved to avoid these those issues by expediting orders when available, and ordering more quantities upfront in advance of the 2022 season. Turns out some of that may have been too much. To be fair, forecasting inventory (or anything at all) in the midst of a global pandemic is an enormously difficult task. Add a war in Eastern Europe and that task gets a lot harder. The upside for consumers is that this may result in some deals as retailers scramble to get inventory out of their backrooms, as American Apparel & Footwear Association President and CEO Stephen Lamar told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. But potential sales for consumers tomorrow offer little consolation for investors today.

5/20/2022,"U.S. stocks fell deeper into the red Thursday after markets failed to claw back from their worst day since June 2020. The declines extend a recent sell-off in equities ignited by worries the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to rein in persistent levels of inflation may spur an economic slowdown. The S&P 500 slid 0.6% to edge closer toward bear market territory, defined as a close of 20% from its recent high. After logging its biggest drop in two years in the last session, the index is down roughly 19% from its all-time high Jan. 3 and must close below 3837.24 to officially enter a bear market. The Dow shed 230 points following a nearly 1,200-point drop in the last session to close at its lowest level since March 2021. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3% after swinging between gains and losses in intraday trading. ""Investors should become accustomed to significant downside and upside moves in stocks, which is common during times of tremendous uncertainty,"" Claro Advisors managing principal and founder Ryan Belanger said in a note. ""We expect the stock market to trade near or in bear market territory for the coming months, creating a frustrating range-bound market that will test the will of many investors."" The losses follow a bevy of weaker-than-expected quarterly results from big-box U.S. retailers that stoked investor fear about the toll inflationary pressures may take on corporate profits and consumer spending. Target (TGT) lost a quarter of its market value on Wednesday after the company reported an operating margin far below analyst estimates and cut its full-year outlook, citing higher transportation costs due to rising fuel prices. ""Today's broad-based market sell-off concerns the ability of companies to pass along higher costs, something that was questioned but which found somewhat of an answer with the retailer's earnings reports,"" LPL Financial Chief Equity Strategist Quincy Krosby said in an email on Wednesday. ""To be sure, consumers continue to spend, but many of the top retailers are unable to pass along the higher labor costs and higher prices wrought by a still constrained supply chain."" Target's report also follows an earnings miss and forecast cut earlier this week from Walmart (WMT), news that has sent shares of the retail giant down 17% in the last two days, marking the stock’s worst two-day sell-off since 1987. “Seemingly safe haven stocks, the staples like Target and Walmart, are not immune,” Cresset Capital CIO Jack Ablin told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. “Investors are looking at these stocks and thought that they were safe havens, and now we’re seeing perhaps they weren’t.” Declines in equity markets Wednesday come on the heels of hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at a Wall Street Journal conference earlier this week that strongly signaled two more 50 basis point interest rate hikes were likely in the coming central bank policy-setting meetings. Uncertainty around the pace and magnitude of the Fed’s rate hiking cycle has stoked pressure across equity markets that has persisted throughout the year as investors worry over the prospect of an economic slowdown if the central bank acts too aggressively. In 2022 so far, the S&P 500 is roughly 18% below its all-time high on Jan. 3, again tip-toeing into bear market territory, while the Dow is down about 14% over the same period and the Nasdaq has fallen deeper into a bear market – 28% below its record closing price in November. “Chairman Powell’s hawkish comments yesterday afternoon and Target’s shrinking profit margins this morning were too much for the market to handle,” Independent Advisor Alliance CIO Chris Zaccarelli said in an emailed note. “Today’s sell-off shows that growth fears are still gripping investors and this year and the Fed doesn’t have their back.” — Here were the main moves in markets at Thursday's close: S&P 500 (^GSPC): -22.96 (-0.59%) to 3,900.72 Dow (^DJI): -236.81 (-0.75%) to 31,253.26 Nasdaq (^IXIC): -29.66 (-0.26%) to 11,388.50 Crude (CL=F): +$2.03 (+1.85%) to $111.62 a barrel Gold (GC=F): +$25.50 (+1.40%) to $1,841.40 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -3.1 bps to yield 2.8550% — Twitter Inc.

5/20/2022,"Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) stock's struggles on the charts aren't being helped by today's selloff on Wall Street. Yesterday, the shoe retailer managed to close above $31 for the first time since March 29. However, FL was last seen 4.8% lower, trading at $30.43, and now sits more than 29% below its year-to-date breakeven mark. And things looks like they could get a lot worse before they get better, as the equity just came within striking distance of a trendline that's yielded bearish results in the past. The trendline in question is Foot Locker stock's 70-day moving average. According to a study from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, the stock has come within one standard deviation of this trendline five other times in the past three years. The shares saw a negative one-month return after 80% of these signals, and averaged a 10.5% drop during that time period. From its current perch, a similar move would put FL just above the $27 level -- a chip shot away from its annual low of $26.36. Meanwhile, Foot Locker is set to report its first-quarter earnings before the open on Friday, May 20. Looking back, FL fell lower following five of its last eight reports, including a 29.8% drop in February. Regardless of direction, the security has averaged a 9.3% next-day swing, which is more than half the 20.6% move the options pits are pricing in this time around. Speaking of, bearish options players are coming out in droves ahead of Foot Locker's quarterly confessional. At the session's halfway point, 5,634 puts have been traded, which is six times the intraday average. Most popular is the May 28 put. New positions are being opened here, indicating these traders are expecting even more downside by the time this contract expires on Friday afternoon.",Business/Schaeffer's Investment Research•yesterday,Foot Locker Stock Faces Key Trendline Ahead of Earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foot-locker-stock-faces-key-171846190.html
