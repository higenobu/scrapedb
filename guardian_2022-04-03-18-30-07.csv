4/3/2022,"It’s the last day of free parking at Porthtowan beach on Cornwall’s wild Atlantic coast before the summer charging season begins. Plenty of people are making the most of the sunny but cold day. The steep hills surrounding the cove are bright yellow with gorse in full bloom, framing the brilliant turquoise sea against the cobalt sky. The wind is up, and white-peaked waves roar on to the sand and cliffs. There are some holidaymakers around, with children bundled up in hats and gloves along with buckets and spades – but most are locals enjoying this quieter time before the tourist season kicks off once again. Porthtowan will be the backdrop to a not-so-picture-postcard scene this weekend, however, when it hosts a rally of rage against the tide of second home ownership that is threatening to wash away the very soul of Cornwall. The county has been romanticised as a dreamy destination for decades. Television schedules are full of programmes on Cornwall, espousing its long walks and pub lunches. Centuries of remoteness, and a life once dominated by farming, mining and fishing, have given way to Instagrammable photo opportunities and aspirational ideals of life by the sea. But locals are increasingly fearful that it has become over-exposed, overpriced and in danger of losing the essence of what makes it such a unique place. The pandemic has stirred up these tensions by further fuelling a property boom, with locals finding themselves priced out by housing wealth from up country that Cornish wages can’t compete with, while at the same time record numbers of visitors use Cornwall as a holiday playground and then leave. The divisions are evident – graffiti was daubed on a holiday home in St Agnes last month. Days later, comments by the chef Gordon Ramsay, who has a second home in Cornwall, about “loving” the county “but hating the Cornish” stoked the fires further. Given that £2bn of revenue comes from tourism, up to a fifth of all private sector income in the county, some say that Cornwall shouldn’t bite the hand that feeds it. But for many who live there, it’s as much about incomers and visitors showing appreciation and consideration as it is about money. A nurse walking on Porthtowan beach, who didn’t want to give her name, turns to look back at the sea before getting in her car. “It’s so beautiful, it’s such a special place. Look at what we have. Who am I to say that someone from Liverpool or Huddersfield or any town anywhere can’t come here and enjoy it too? We are so lucky to live here and we want to share it with others, but we do want Cornwall to be treated with respect,” she says. “I grew up here, I’ll never leave. Some people say Cornwall should just be for the Cornish – I don’t agree with that sentiment at all. I mean, what does it mean to be Cornish? There are people who live here who’ve come from all over the world, and they have every right to make a life here and be part of communities here. I don’t even have a problem with second homes in principle – but people who live and work here should be able to afford to live here too.” Retirees John Adey and Penny Avant have also been enjoying a brisk walk on the beach. They moved from neighbouring Devon to be nearer their daughters, both of whom live in fields, one in a caravan, one in a cabin, because of lack of housing options. “There is a myth that Cornwall is totally dependent on tourism. It’s not. It’s full of lots of people who have normal jobs. And those that do work in tourism need jobs that are all-year-round. We can understand why people come, why it’s so attractive. But it feels like Cornwall is on the edge now. It can’t exist just as a holiday destination. Once communities are gone, then the whole place becomes a theme park,” says Adey. Kim Conchie, who runs the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, admits tourism has put the county close to breaking point. “Visitors provide a lot of colour to Cornwall, a lot of custom, and have driven a rise in standards in restaurants, food offerings and accommodation. If people are coming here and paying for services that Cornwall has to offer in a vernacular way that suits the Cornish psyche, then I’m all in favour of them. “But there were visitors last year who hadn’t got any feel for the soul of Cornwall, and I think that upset locals a lot – especially those with brand new Range Rovers that won’t pull into the hedge because they might scratch the side. Those attitudes create conflict,” says Conchie. “The second homes debate is a real one, and anyone denying it is burying their head in the sand,” he says, adding that he would like Cornwall to have the power to do the same as the Welsh government and heavily tax second homes. He wants to see a much more balanced economy. “There is more to Cornwall than tourism. We want a thriving hospitality sector, but one that works alongside other industries, like technology and renewable energy. If Cornwall’s future is based around those things, then it could be quite a rosy one – we could be on the cusp of a new golden age for Cornwall.” Jess Ratty is part of that vanguard fighting for a future far removed from the perception of Cornwall as nothing more than holidays, cream teas and pasties. The 37-year-old grew up in St Austell and never left. She began as a waitress at the Eden Project and now runs a thriving PR and communications agency, Halo, which works with global technology and space industries. “We have soul, culture, history – and opinions – here in Cornwall,” she says. “I think problems lie in the lack of communication, which many of us are trying to fix. We actually have one of the best tech scenes in the UK – marine tech, rocket science, agri-tech, health tech, clean tech. And we’re working on new skills, powered by bodies like Cornwall’s Digital Skills Partnership. “The space sector alone is going to bring the types of jobs our engineering and mining ancestors would give their back teeth for, and opportunities for young people that just don’t get talked about enough.” “I have a young daughter and I want her to grow up here and feel like Cornwall is a place where she belongs. It is her home and it should also be her place of work as well as a playground for all,” she says. “I think we can do that – with ambition, support and understanding of the true situation many people face.” She has offered to have a friendly pint with Gordon Ramsay any time. But it’s not just Ramsay who has raised hackles. The co-founder of the Eden Project, Sir Tim Smit, recently suggested the Cornish are prone to harking back to imaginary “good old days”, and moaning about their lot while not being “articulate enough” to speak up for themselves. Smit was speaking in a podcast made by the comedian and musician Seamas Carey, who grew up in and lives in Cornwall. After tuning the piano of a second-home owner while struggling to find somewhere to live himself, Carey, 28, decided to make a podcast exploring the issues he was facing. From gentrification and second-home ownership to nationalism and Cornwall’s cultural heritage, he went on a personal journey through Cornwall’s soul. “I wanted to spark conversations and debate,” says Carey. He worries for the future of Cornwall, but as he finishes editing the last episode of his series, ultimately feels more positive about Cornwall than when he started. “I worry massively about where I am going to live. But the narrative is changing, and it’s wrong to put the blame on certain scapegoats. “The Cornish can be grumpy, although people do come here and trample all over the place. But look at the history of Cornwall – it’s been a global trading hub for thousands of years,” he says. “I think some of the traditionalists are holding on too tightly to what they think is Cornish culture. The spirit of Cornwall, well – it can be anything and can be embodied by so-called newcomers as much as anyone. Things always change. I remain hopeful about life here – it’s frustrating and challenging. But totally worth it.”",News/UK news,"Surf, scones… but no homes: the battle for the soul of Cornwall",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/surf-scones-but-no-homes-the-battle-for-the-soul-of-cornwall
4/3/2022,"When Joe Biden released his annual budget proposal last week, one number in particular jumped out to progressives: $813bn. That is how much Biden is calling to spend on national defense in the US in the coming fiscal year. If approved, that number would represent the largest defense budget that America has ever seen. US presidents’ budget proposals are generally considered to be reflections of their policy priorities rather than realistic estimates of final spending allocations. If Biden’s call for a 4% increase in defense spending was meant to signal his policy priorities, progressives wasted no time in telling the president that his priorities are backwards. Progressive lawmakers have fiercely criticized the proposed defense budget, arguing that the US already spends far too much on its military and needs to invest more in domestic programs. But the war in Ukraine has complicated progressives’ arguments and given Republicans an opening to demand even more money for the military. Just hours after the White House announced its budget proposal on Monday, leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus released a statement attacking Biden’s plan to increase defense spending and opening up a familiar split in the party. “It is simply unacceptable that after the conclusion of our longest war and during a period of Democratic control of both chambers of Congress, the president is proposing record high military spending,” said the CPC chair, Pramila Jayapal, and former chairs Mark Pocan and Barbara Lee. “Appropriators and advocates are constantly called to answer for how we will afford spending on lowering costs and expanding access to healthcare, housing, childcare services, on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, and on combating climate change – but such concerns evaporate when it comes to the Pentagon’s endlessly growing, unaudited budget.” We do not need to raise the defense budget by another $31 billion.It's time to make investments into our communities — not into a defense budget that is already larger than the next 11 countries combined. pic.twitter.com/2nUpMpNt6E Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate budget committee, echoed the CPC’s concerns, saying on Monday, “At a time when we are already spending more on the military than the next 11 countries combined, no we do not need a massive increase in the defense budget.” So far, the White House has stood by its request, insisting the increased funding will allow the US to better defend its international interests and assist Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s military assault. “As I have said many times, we need resources matched to strategy, strategy matched to policy and policy matched to the will of the American people,” the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said. “This budget gives us the resources we need to deliver on that promise.” And even as progressives urge Biden to curb funding for the military, the president is simultaneously facing criticism from the right for not proposing an even higher defense spending hike in response to the war in Ukraine. “The world is a dangerous place and growing more dangerous by the day,” the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Monday. “Amid all this, the White House has proposed no meaningful increase in resources for protecting innocent Americans, promoting our interests, supporting our partners, assisting Ukraine, or replenishing our stockpiles.” Progressives have pushed for years to lower US defense spending, but the devastation in Ukraine has added a new challenge to their efforts. Polling indicates that a majority of Americans believe Biden has not been tough enough in his response to Russia’s aggression, which has added fuel to Republicans’ demands for more military funding. But progressives are not abandoning their campaign, instead arguing that the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates how US military dollars would be better spent elsewhere. “I think it’s a political challenge, but it’s not an actual budgetary challenge. This increase in money is not about Ukraine. This is about spending more on the US military-industrial complex,” said Robert Weissman, president of the progressive group Public Citizen. “The United States already spends more than 10 times what Russia does on its military. And that expenditure, obviously, didn’t deter Russia from invading Ukraine.” Even as Republicans point to the war in Ukraine to advocate for more defense spending, it is worth remembering that most of Biden’s budget proposal was crafted before the Russian invasion. Dr Travis Sharp, budget studies director at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the requested funding increase is more a reflection of how record-high US inflation has affected government agencies’ finances rather than the impact of the crisis in Ukraine. “Providing a higher level of defense spending does help to correct for some of the decreasing buying power as a result of inflation,” Sharp said. “If you didn’t provide a higher level of defense spending, then you would be trying to support the same-sized military with less money, so that would force you to make some hard trade-offs.” However, progressives reject inflation-based arguments for increasing the Pentagon’s budget, saying the Pentagon has consistently failed to account for how it spends its funds and should not be trusted with even more money. “An agency that can’t pass an audit needs to do a little bit more homework before we can be honest about what the impacts of inflation are,” said Stephen Miles, president of the progressive group Win Without War. He added, “Republicans don’t seem particularly concerned about the impacts of inflation on any other part of the budget, besides the military.” As the number of US coronavirus deaths nears 1 million and the world faces the grim realities of climate change, it was “unconscionable” to demand more funding for the military, Miles said. “The threats we face in the 21st century are primarily not going to be solved by spending more money at the Pentagon,” he told the Guardian. For Sharp, the Pentagon’s significant budget is a reflection of America’s military commitments around the world and its strategy to maintain strong alliances with key foreign partners. He suggested that, in order for progressives to be successful in their push to lower defense spending, they need to make a pitch for a new kind of American foreign policy. “If you really want to reduce the size of US defense spending, then you need to go after the strategy,” Sharp said. “If you pare back the strategy, reduce the operational tempo, then the dollars will decline proportionately.”",News/US news,Biden’s record defense budget draws progressive ire over spending priorities,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/03/biden-record-defense-budget-progressive-spending-priorities
4/3/2022,"It is nearly 5,000 miles from the scrub and deserts of south-west Sudan to the urbane, calm capital of the Netherlands, and a journey that Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman never thought he would make. Eighteen years ago, the 65-year-old was a “feared and revered” commander of a brigade of the infamous Janjaweed militia, paramilitaries deployed alongside Sudanese government forces to carry out a scorched-earth campaign against rebels and their communities that the UN says left 300,000 people dead and displaced 2.5 million. On Thursday, Abd-al-Rahman, who is also known as Ali Kushayb, will appear before the international criminal court (ICC) to face 31 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, rape and torture. If the three judges decide that he is guilty, the man once known among the Janjaweed as “the colonel of colonels” could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Campaigners have described a landmark in the struggle to bring perpetrators of mass killings in sub-Saharan Africa to justice. Human Rights Watch, the global campaign group, said: “This trial is the first time a leader will be held to account for serious crimes allegedly committed in Darfur, albeit 18 years after the crimes began. [It] … is also the first by the ICC on crimes committed by state forces and allied militias in Darfur, and shows that those who commit crimes can still face justice, even over a decade later.” The trial comes at a difficult time in Sudan, where a civilian-led transition to democracy that followed the fall of dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 was derailed by a military coup in October. A humanitarian crisis is unfurling across swaths of the country as inflation touches more than 250% annually. Since taking power, Sudan’s new rulers have snuffed any hopes that democracy might take hold after decades of dictatorship. Repeated demonstrations against military rule have been broken up with teargas and live fire, with at least 93 deaths. On Thursday a 23-year-old protester was shot in the chest as thousands marched towards the presidential palace in central Khartoum before dispersing amid teargas and bullets. Some protesters carried signs reading “April 6”, referring to further protests planned this week to mark the anniversary of the largest demonstrations against al-Bashir three years ago. “There is a very strong sentiment about rejecting military rule but the military is completely refusing to release its grip on power. There is a zero-sum mentality. No one is willing to negotiate or compromise,” said Maram Mahdi, an analyst at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria, South Africa. Abd-al-Rahman has been in the ICC’s custody since June 2020, when he gave himself up in a remote corner of northern Central African Republic, near the country’s border with Sudan. He had fled Sudan following the fall of Bashir to avoid trial on charges of murder, rape and other serious offences that carry a death penalty there. The then chief ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said Abd-al-Rahman’s surrender and transfer into the court’s custody nearly two decades after the Darfur conflict began was “a powerful and sombre reminder that the victims of atrocity crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan have waited too long to see justice done”. At subsequent pre-trial hearings last year Bensouda said she would show that he had led attacks on towns and villages and was implicated in more than 300 murders and raids that forced 40,000 mainly ethnic Fur civilians from their homes. “The evidence shows that Mr Abd-al-Rahman was a knowing, willing and energetic perpetrator of these crimes,” Bensouda told the hearing. Abd-al-Rahman did not respond in detail to any of the allegations against him but told the court: “What I heard does not apply to me.” Though Sudan is not a party to the ICC, a UN resolution requires the government to cooperate with the court. But the political turmoil means the chances of bringing further fugitives sought by the ICC to The Hague are slim. One is the former dictator Bashir, who is wanted on charges of genocide. Two other suspects are senior figures from al-Bashir’s rule: Abdel-Rahim Mohammed Hussein, interior and defence minister during much of the conflict, and Ahmed Haroun, a security chief at the time and later the leader of al-Bashir’s ruling party. Haroun is believed to be in custody in Sudan, but the whereabouts of Hussein are unknown. Sudan’s transitional government, which took office in 2019 after Bashir fell, promised to cooperate and approved the transfer of the three wanted men to the ICC. However, many of those now occupying positions of power are themselves implicated in the horrific violence in the restive region. Thousands of veterans of the Janjaweed militia have joined the feared paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, commanded by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who is now the de facto deputy leader of Sudan and seen by many as the most influential man in the country. “The signals at the moment point much more to obstruction [of the ICC] than continued cooperation,” said Mahdi.",News/World news,Darfur war crimes trial opens as army cracks down in Sudan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/darfur-war-crimes-trial-opens-as-army-cracks-down-in-sudan
4/3/2022,"The fact that we’re generally living longer is what success looks like for humanity. And our collective ageing is a big feature of the 2020s, with higher longevity combining with the large baby-boomer cohort retiring to mean this decade will see a faster ageing population than any other between the 1960s and the 2060s. But the UK’s ageing population also brings pressures for the public finances. Demographic change on its own is set to push up social security spending (mainly the state pension) on the over-60s by £22bn a year by 2030. And ageing raises healthcare costs, especially when combined with increasing morbidity – the length of time spent in ill health. In 2015, 44% of 85- to 89-year-olds had two or more long-term conditions, up from 34% in 2006. But it’s not just patients who are ageing; so are the doctors. Around a quarter of GPs are aged 55-plus. What will all these baby-boomer GPs retiring mean for healthcare? New research from the US examines the impact on patients aged 65 and over of their GPs retiring. The effects are big, but not all negative. As you’d expect, losing their GP leads to less primary care (6% down over the first four years), partly offset by more use of other services (for 18 months, A&E visits are more likely). More positively, there’s a pick-up in diagnosis of chronic conditions such as Alzheimer’s – a fresh pair of eyes and maybe more testing as you settle in with a new GP helps. The net effect, though, is higher costs for providing healthcare, especially where a GP was retiring from a solo practice, making transition to a new doctor harder. So it’s not just ageing patients pushing up health spending, retiring GPs are too. Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

4/3/2022,"Catherine the Great, who ruled Russia for more than 30 years in the late 18th century, copied eccentric English childcare methods to try to alter Europe’s view of her empire as unsophisticated and feudal. The harsh nursery regime favoured by the English royal family, including long walks for toddlers, cold water washing and no rocking of cribs, was adopted by the empress’s own palace in St Petersburg once she received a note outlining the rules followed by the royal nanny in London. “The emphasis was on discipline and fresh air,” said Lucy Ward, the author of a new book that reveals startling practices in both royal households. “It is all hearty and no-frills stuff but, for Catherine, it was part of showing the world just how progressive Russia was.” In a message to the empress, the nurse Louisa Chieveley, who tended George III’s 15 babies, claimed it was “their constant living, the regularity of which, with air and exercise, makes them the healthiest family in the world”. As part of what Catherine described as her own “anglomania”, in 1768 she also secretly summoned a doctor from Hertfordshire to travel out to inoculate her and her young family against smallpox, a technique that was highly controversial. The charismatic despot, who is played by Elle Fanning in the hit Channel 4 drama The Great, reigned over her empire from 1762 to 1796, and was determined to impress European elites with her adherence to modern scientific advice. “These ideas were part of her interest in education and health. Russia had a big child mortality problem and it was seen as crucial to expand the population,” said Ward. The Empress and the English Doctor, published on Thursday, makes use of several previously unseen papers that belonged to the Quaker-born English physician Thomas Dimsdale. The doctor’s own sister had died of smallpox, and by the time he was summoned to Russia, Dimsdale had already inoculated 6,000 people, with live small pox with only one reported death. At Catherine’s request, Dimsdale also went to Chieveley, officially titled Head Superintendent of the Royal Nursery, in 1779 and obtained key childcare details. “As the royal family are very large, they are never put on their feet till a year old and generally walk perfectly well three or four months after. The only medicines used are rhubarb and magnesia, which are given whenever it is necessary, and walking twice every day except in rain,” explained Chieveley, adding, “It is usual in the royal family for children of three or four years old to walk four or five miles in a day.” Catherine gained power in Russia as the wife of Peter III, who was murdered in 1762. As a native German, she saw Russia as part of Europe. “Although Catherine quickly learned the Russian language and used the Orthodox church to bond with the Russian people, there was a pivot towards Englishness in her court,” said Ward. “English habits, along with hunting dogs and garden design, became fashionable, but it was also really important for her to fundamentally change Europe’s view of the country. It was this thinking that led her towards inoculation.” Smallpox swept Russia shortly after Catherine came to power, with more than one in five people affected. Emperor Peter II had died of it at the age of 14, on the eve of his wedding. “Catherine is commonly associated with a lie about having died during an odd sex act but, in fact, the most interesting thing that she ever did with her body was get herself inoculated,” said Ward. Pragmatic English doctors could see that inoculation worked, even though it was dangerous. Safer vaccination methods came later in 1798 when less virulent bovine pox was injected by Edward Jenner to boost immunity. Catherine invited Dimsdale and his third wife, Elizabeth, to return to Russia later to carry out the same procedure on her two grandsons, one of whom became Tsar Alexander I. She also made the doctor a Russian Baron and gifted him large sums of money. “Catherine really knew how to handle state symbolism,” said Ward. “She was an expert in that side of leadership and wrote letters to Voltaire about her inoculation because she knew that would help spread the word.” Soon after her initial inoculation by Dimsdale, Catherine embarked upon the first Russo-Turkish war and successfully took control of Crimea.",Arts/Books,Walks and rhubarb: how Catherine the Great looked to England for top parenting tips,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/03/walks-and-rhubarb-how-catherine-the-great-looked-to-england-for-top-parenting-tips
4/3/2022,"Farzad Kapadia has been paying off his $130,000 in student loans since 2012. During the pandemic, a pause on federal student loan payments set in March 2020 temporarily lifted the burden for Kapadia, 40, though he continued to make payments on smaller loans with private lenders. “I can’t describe the amount of relief it’s given me. It’s been life-changing,” Kapadia said. “Prior to the moratorium, I would burn through every single check, I’d have nothing left at the end of the month. I’d be going into credit card debt.” The pause is scheduled to expire on 1 May after two years in place, and Kapadia – who is one of nearly 45 million Americans with student debt – said that he was “terrified” at the idea of payments getting started again, especially since inflation has meant his cost of living has gone up. Over the last decade, Kapadia has managed to pay off most of his principal loan amount, $80,000, but is still working to pay off the $50,000 of interest his loan has accrued. “Having a huge chunk taken out immediately and put towards interest payment, despite having paid back the full principal balance, I just find that to be usury and cruel, really,” Kapadia said. Kapadia is joining hundreds of borrowers who are heading to Washington DC on 4 Aprilto protest against student debt and advocate for Joe Biden’s cancellation of student loans. Among the 60-plus organizations taking part are MoveOn, the Working Families party, NextGen America and the Hip Hop Caucus. Activists say the expiration of the loan pause and the economy’s high rate of inflation mean there is even more urgency to address the student debt crisis. The Debt Collective, a union of borrowers, is organizing the rally and said protesters from across the country will be traveling to DC for the event. The organization said that if Biden allows payment on federal loans to start again on 1 May, the collective will commence a debt strike once payments resume – a tactic that the group has coordinated before. “There’s really no good reason to restart payments, especially when household budgets are already being squeezed by the cost of living going up,” said Thomas Gokey, legal and policy director for the Debt Collective. “To put an additional, on average, $400 student loan payment on millions of households is really adding a lot of pain when people are already experiencing it quite a bit.” The concern is shared among many with student debt: A survey of more than 20,000 borrowers by the Student Debt Crisis Center conducted in February found that 92% of fully employed borrowers are concerned about being able to afford their student loan payments because of inflation. Along with the general rise in cost of living affecting borrowers, inflation could affect the interest rates of those who have debt with private lenders. While many with federal student loans have fixed interest rates, those who have debt with private lenders can be subject to increased interest rates after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point this month. When he was running for president, Biden advocated for canceling at least $10,000 in debt for each person with student loans – a plan that was first proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren. While the White House and the Department of Education has been mum on any plans around extending the pause, Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, suggested that the administration is considering policies that go beyond a moratorium extension. “The president is going to look at what we should do on student debt before the pause expires, or he’ll extend the pause,” Klain said in early March, adding that Biden is “the only president in history where no one’s paid on their student loans for the entirety of his presidency”. “The question whether or not there’s some executive action on student debt forgiveness when payments resume is a decision we’re going to take before payments resume,” he said. On Thursday, a group of nearly 100 lawmakers sent a letter to Biden urging him to extend the pause on federal student loans until at least the end of the year and ultimately work toward debt cancellation. The lawmakers cited Klain’s recent comments as “encouraging to millions of borrowers across the country”. Advocates have noted that the momentum around student debt cancellation has continued to grow as the pause on federal loans, which was first undertaken by Donald Trump’s administration, has been renewed several times, giving borrowers a glimpse at relief. “We’re getting to a point with loan pauses that one of the things that [the administration] talks about is wanting to have a smooth transition to repayment,” said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center. “We’ve gotten to a point that one of the only ways to do that is cancel student debt.” Kapadia said he was hopeful that the administration would consider cancelling student debt, “leveling the playing field”, but was anxious about the amount of time the White House is taking to act. “You’ve got folks making payments their entire adult lives,” he said. “[Biden] has the complete authority to do something to drastically to change millions of lives, and he’s sitting on it.”",Lifestyle/Money,"With US student loan payments pause set to end, debtors seek cancellation",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/03/student-debt-pause-payments-relief
4/3/2022,"The inspirational Leicester comedy festival awards ceremony, which I attended on Monday in the ballroom of the refurbished Grade II-listed Mercure Leicester Grand, could only have been improved by a multimillionaire performatively punching another multimillionaire in the face. Nonetheless, my once-in-a-lifetime Legend of Comedy statuette win was overshadowed by the violent brawling of the Oscar attendeees, meaning my achievement remained unmentioned in all the major American entertainment trade papers. Bah! It was almost a very different story. While I and the other Leicester winners were posing for our photos, I nearly stepped backwards off the 18-inch podium, briefly losing one of my hearing aids as it fell from my ear. This should have been one of the Leicester Mercury’s biggest stories of the year, doubtless going viral and helping me to sell as many tour tickets as being punched in the face has shifted for Chris Rock. But in the wake of mouthgate, no one was interested. I can honestly say that, of the many I have been professionally obliged to attend, the Leicester comedy festival awards ceremony was the only one I have ever enjoyed. It was certainly better than the 2011 Baftas, where Michael McIntyre’s famously excited late manager got me in a headlock in a dark corner and said he would personally see to it that my career was destroyed, while his own minder struggled to free me from his employer’s chokehold. To this day, I have a psychosomatic reaction to the very mention of McIntyre’s name that leaves me gasping for air. Or is that a nut allergy? I think the awards night felt exceptional to me because the Leicester comedy festival itself is uncharacteristically and inherently worthwhile and isn’t just built around selling booze and bribing executives. The accolades handed out reflected its commitment to encouraging new talent and to building a cultural profile for unfairly overlooked Leicester, previously only famous for being the home of the world’s fattest man, Daniel Lambert. The enormous cock-fighter managed to achieve the weight of 53st in 1805. Seeing his portrait in Leicester as a child, and realising the sacrifices he had made to become a legend, inspired me to follow my dreams. I wore my Daniel Lambert pin badge as I received my Legend award and considered my debt to him paid. The middle “has-been” phase of my career is now officially over and I am into the third and final “legend” act, a clear downhill bobsleigh run to an early grave and subsequent critical reappraisal. Today, it has become necessary for most mainstream awards ceremonies, from the Oscars down to whatever the British comedy awards are called this year, to be archly hosted with the sassy contempt of a cocaine-addled Friars Club roast by a dutifully disrespectful, high-profile comedian for hire. Is this because even the people putting the events together suspect, deep down, that both the artists and the works they are supposed to be recognising probably aren’t really all that outstanding after all? An Oscar tradition that, in recent years, has not found space for Paddy Considine, Mark Jenkin’s Bait or my own King Rocker, yet rewards violent hooliganism and The Nutty Professor, is demonstrably worthless. Rock is one of the world’s greatest standups, and his 1996 routine about the black community’s perception of itself is in the all-time top 10. Hosting the Oscars is quite frankly beneath him and they should have just let Ricky Gervais do it again, as he has no dignity to lose. Rock wouldn’t host a corporate Christmas gig for a logistics company and agree to mention the CEO’s wig and the time Sally from accounts was sick in a plant pot, so why is he whoring himself out in the same way to the Academy? Rock brings shame on the nobility of the standup’s profession. Most of the put-downs Rock trotted out would have been prepared anyway, generated by hired hands in a packed Hollywood writers’ room, and which the Academy, desperate for publicity, had already approved and signed off on. Employing the controversial comedian is a risk cynically calculated to drive traffic. Don’t shoot the messenger. If Will Smith had run off and punched the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president, David Rubin, hard in his stupid Hollywood face, I’d have had more respect for him. Rock was just the patsy. Smith’s punches, justified or not, fell wide of the target. Jada Pinkett Smith’s position on her husband’s chivalrous battering of Rock’s tiny face went unreported. In 1987, an observant builder extravagantly complimented my feminist girlfriend’s figure in no uncertain terms and my 11st, 19-year-old frame immediately plunged into battle, as fellow builders theatrically held their colleague back. My girlfriend immediately reprimanded me for a sexism, as it wasn’t for me to fight another man over her. Today, my feminist wife tells me that, although my girlfriend’s criticisms were correct, I would also have looked like a loser if I hadn’t reacted. It was a lose-lose situation. The builder, unlike Rock, was at least doing his own material and perhaps comes out as the winner here. Smith’s awards night ended with violence, disciplinary proceedings and the threat of expulsion. Mine ended with Guinness, Highland Park and the kind of curious, regionally specific crisp selection I can’t resist, in a stained-glass-windowed backstreet bar full of vibrant local artists and standups, duty bound to indulge my reminiscences of the pre-podcasting cultural landscape. For once in my life, in this filthy business, I felt as if I came out ahead. Back in my hotel room, I realised I had spilled mango chutney dip from some poppadom snacks down my awards ceremony shirt, but my hosts had been respectful enough to ignore it. I was now officially a legend, even with all chutney all on me. And I wouldn’t have traded places with Will Smith for the world.

4/3/2022,"Aarhus has both Michelin-star dining and cheaper options loved by the locals. For the latter, Teater Bodega serves traditional Danish cuisine that is affordable yet great quality. Here you’ll get the best stegt flæsk med persillesovs (fried pork belly with parsley sauce), with a glass of the strong local spirit, snaps. It also serves good vegetarian dishes, if you ask for them, and the place oozes Aarhus history, being more than 100 years old. For shared dishes, such as khinkali (meat-filled Georgian dumplings), visit the Eastern European-inspired Bardok, which has a great bar. The best affordable meal is at down-to-earth food pub Vesterlauget, whose blackboard menu might include wild boar ragout or mushroom risotto. It’s impossible to talk about Aarhus without mentioning ARoS: it’s one of the largest art museums in northern Europe, with its much photographed rainbow-coloured, glass-walled “skywalk” by Olafur Eliasson on top. It’s a very unorthodox and modern museum, with exhibitions from all over the world. Moesgaard Museum, a few miles out of the city, explores the evolution of mankind through ancient times and the Viking age. The museum is surrounded by breathtaking nature and its design is very innovative. The cafe has big windows over a lawned rooftop where you can walk and breathe in the feeling of infinity. Aarhus is a university city, with a vibrant atmosphere. The cobbled streets of the Latin Quarter have great shopping and independent cafes and bars. Visitors shouldn’t miss secondhand shop Soul Shine, and beer and coffee place Ris Ras. The Quarter seems unaffected by Aarhus’s recent urban development. The same is true of the Jægergårdsgade, Frederiksbjerg and Marselisborg neighbourhoods, which remain unchanged and are great places to enjoy lunch or stroll with an ice-cream. The Botanical Garden is a must, with superb tropical houses and plant collections. Aarhus also has many beautiful parks; try Tangkrogen, Marselisborg Memorial Park, Riis Skov and Marselisborg Dyrehave (deer park). If you are after sea views, check out Lystbaadehavn (Aarhus Marina), where you can grab an ice-cream on the pier and pop into one of the cafes. For mainstream music and a dancefloor, go into the city centre where there are loads of options. If you are into rock music and beer, visit Sway or Escobar. If you like an unpretentious atmosphere on a dancefloor with room for your dodgy moves, visit HeadQuarters, which I own. At weekends, HeadQuarters turns from a music venue into a nightclub, which will take you back to the original discotheques with a soul and funk vibe. Or try Café Paradis, a hot club with good cocktails and a cool urban atmosphere. Aarhus has a long music history, and the city’s Royal Academy of Music produces brilliant musicians, who often play at local live music venues and festivals. Spot Festival in May focuses on up-and-coming music, and there’s the sustainable NorthSide Festival in June. Venues such as the Musikhuset concert hall, Radar, VoxHall, Godsbanen and Train offer a full range of live music. For an affordable option, the newly opened boutique hostel BOOK1 (dorm beds from £28, doubles £89 room-only) is right in the city centre and has suites as well as “pod dorms”. It is in a former library and the design is very cool. Villa Provence (doubles from £146 B&B) is a small, French-inspired, family-owned hotel towards the waterfront, with Nordic vibes and lots of hygge.

4/3/2022,"So there we have it. On a sunny April Sunday at Christchurch, Meg Lanning’s Australia were formally named the best ODI team in the world, stealing the crown from reigning champions England by 71 runs. If we are honest, we already knew Australia were the best team in the world. It’s just that now, with the 20-over title, the Ashes and the 50-over World Cup all sitting pretty in their trophy cabinet, they have finally made it official. This tournament, with its sea of final-over finishes, called for a competitive final, but Australia had not read that script. Their version was to pile on the runs first up, making a mockery of Heather Knight’s decision to bowl first. Australia had 160 up before England managed to make a single breakthrough – the highest partnership for any wicket, ever, in a World Cup final – and 316 before the next one came. With 356 runs on the board at the innings break, England might as well have got on the plane then and there, although an unbeaten 148 from Nat Sciver in the run chase did at least give them something to cheer about as they watched the fruits of their 2017 victory slip through their fingers. As for Alyssa Healy’s innings – 170 off 138 balls, including 26 boundaries – what can you say? England had kept her relatively quiet for the first ten, but when she danced down the track and lofted Charlie Dean for four over mid-on in the 12th over, it set the scene for what was to follow: not just the highest individual innings in any World Cup final (women’s or men’s), but the most audacious one too. Runs came thick and fast, all around the ground – Katherine Brunt’s short balls were pulled ferociously, Dean was driven out of the attack, and tournament leading wicket-taker Sophie Ecclestone went for 71 across her 10 overs. Healy reached her ton in the 35th over and from there, all bets were off as she added another 70 runs in just 38 deliveries. All the while England had to deal with the knowledge that Nat Sciver had put the opener down at midwicket on 41 - an error that cost them 129 runs. Rachael Haynes (68 off 93) was her early partner in crime, hitting her fourth fifty-plus score of the tournament after she, too, enjoyed a let-off by England, put down at backward point by Danni Wyatt on 47. England finally had her caught at the same position in the 30th over, but by then, with a 160-run platform in place, the No 3 Beth Mooney (62 off 47) could afford to throw her bat at the ball in complete abandon – her own 156-run partnership with Healy taking just 98 balls to rack up. This was meant to be one-day international cricket but as Healy and Mooney smashed boundary after boundary there were echoes of March 2020, when the pair annihilated India in the T20 version of this event. Between the 41st and the 45th overs, the England bowlers were punished for an average of 16 runs an over. Australia could have added yet more to their mammoth total had it not been for some wily death bowling by Anya Shrubsole (three for 46), who took pace off the ball to have Healy stumped , just when she looked on course for a double-hundred. Three balls later, Shrubsole removed the bails to run out Ash Gardner, dashing back for a second run after Mooney chanced Kate Cross’s arm at long-on. In her next over Shrubsole took two-in-two, having Lanning caught before Sciver held on in the deep as Mooney finally departed. Shrubsole had famously been England’s heroine in the 2017 final with a cluster of wickets at the back end; this time around the achievement amounted to damage limitation. In reply, England refused to surrender their title without a fight: Tammy Beaumont, Knight, Amy Jones and Sophia Dunkley all got into the twenties. Even when the holders were eight wickets down after 34 overs, a 65-run partnership between Sciver and Dean off just 53 balls gave a glimmer of hope. But Australia made regular inroads: Megan Schutt’s opening spell, littered with dramatic in-swing, had Danni Wyatt bowled and Beaumont lbw in the powerplay, while Alana King’s leg-spin yielded three wickets for 64. King could easily have had another – Sciver was handed a reprieve by DRS on 23, with ball-tracking showing the spinner’s delivery was just missing the stumps. Instead, Sciver slammed her for the only six of the match over deep midwicket before progressing patiently on to her second century of the tournament, even as her partners came and went at the other end. Shrubsole was the last to go, holing out to mid-off in the 44th to hand Jess Jonassen not just her third wicket of the day, but a World Cup winners’ medal to go with it after Australia’s ninth win from nine matches in this tournament. On any other day, against any other opposition, an innings like Sciver’s and a run chase of 285 inside 44 overs would have won England the game. But this is Lanning’s Australia, and even England’s best simply could not quite cut it.",Sport/Sport,Australia power to Women’s Cricket World Cup final win over England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/03/australia-england-womens-cricket-world-cup-final-report
4/3/2022,"It was a particularly piquant news story: a pub in the Dartmoor village of Belstone decided to the change “ploughman’s lunch” to “ploughperson’s lunch”. Well, you can imagine the ensuing froth, fuss and furore that greeted the decision. Wrote one Charlotte Deakins on social media: “The world is off its rocker and quite frankly I’m sick of it.” Defending the decision, the landlord of the Tors pub, Dicky Harrison, said: “It’s just a bit of fun and a nod to the amazing ladies who work the land here. I didn’t think it would cause offence but in reality women plough too.” Which got me digging into the origins of the meal. Far from being centuries old, the name seems to have come into being only in the 1950s, when the Cheese Bureau, a marketing body, began promoting it in pubs as a way to increase the sales of cheese, which had recently ceased to be rationed. Fair enough. Anyway, while the online reaction was entirely predictable, it all smacks of a publicity stunt to me and I suggest that you march with your feet and boycott the Tors for being so shameless. Another story that caught my eye concerned business jargon and the finding that most office workers who are on the receiving end don’t believe that those who use it know what they’re talking about. Following research from communications firm Enreach, the most loathed term was “blue-sky thinking”. Other contenders for odium were “thinking outside the box”, “low-hanging fruit” and “getting your ducks in a row”. I don’t think I’ve ever known anyone use these appalling phrases, except in a heavily ironic way. I’m only sorry that my particular bete noire – “having skin in the game’ – didn’t get a dishonourable mention.

4/3/2022,"We are just two weeks away from the birth of our daughter, and my son is making sense of it through dinosaurs. Namely by playing with four triceratopses, roughly equivalent to our own family unit: a large one, Daddy, a slightly smaller one, Mummy, a quite small one, him, and then another very small triceratops, which he calls ‘baby’. He repeats the words we say to him, or the baby, to these dinosaurs, and brings them with him everywhere he goes, most especially for bathing. I say bathing, but our new house doesn’t have a bath, offering instead a free-standing shower that is extremely – almost alarmingly – large. Seriously, I’ve been to folk gigs in smaller spaces, and its fully enclosed glass door means several people could happily use it at once. Perhaps this was its intended purpose, as a convivial solution to the pain and boredom of showering alone. Why submit to the drudgery of breaking off conversations just because you’ve started to smell, the architect probably thought, when you can invite your poker buddies in for a scrub with you? While I’ve not yet mined its potential as a hospitality suite, or renting it out as a gig space, I have hosted one person there several times, and quite against his will. Its size has made it logisitically easier for my son and I to fit together for his now-entirely euphemistically named ‘bath times’ but, sadly, its comforts end there. The first time we tried it, he acted as if I was preparing him to be eaten, horrified that the serene joys of rubber ducks and soapy bubbles had been replaced with the decidedly less comforting image of his large, awkward, naked father pointing a showerhead at him in a glass box the size of Hampstead Heath. He ran to the far wall – it took him a few minutes – and cowered like one of those inmates being deloused at the beginning of The Shawshank Redemption. ‘It’ll just be a minute, pet,’ I assured him as I pelted him with lukewarm water. I quickly realised the best way to get him to endure this process is to periodically give him control of the showerhead, to allow him to spray me to his heart’s content, while I surreptitiously apply soap and shampoo to his oblivious body. Washing a toddler is, basically, like washing rice – you want to keep doing it until the water sluicing down the plughole runs clear, and not the odd, yellowy-orangey cordial of dirt, muck and food that scientists (me) call Toddler Juice. This done, I cede control once more, and he spends the last few minutes washing not me, but his tiny nuclear family of Ceratopsidae, who have thus far watched all this unfold in silence. He sprays their tiny plastic forms, until they squeak. ‘It’ll just be a minute, pet,’ he coos gently, blasting each with the love of a doting, desperate dad.
