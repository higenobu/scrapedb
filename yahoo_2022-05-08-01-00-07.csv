5/8/2022,"Just a few days shy of what would be Madeleine McCann’s 19th birthday, a break in the case points to everyone’s worst fears: that the Briton was abducted, sold and killed by a pedophile sex ring that worked in the area when she died 15 years ago. Thousands of tips and hundreds of sightings led to dead ends until Christian Brückner was officially named a suspect on April 22 of this year. The 45-year-old German, who is in jail for raping a 72-year-old American in the same village where McCann disappeared, denies taking any part in the crime. But Hans Christian-Wolters first told a Portuguese television channel and then confirmed to The Daily Beast that they have proof that he was at the center of the disappearance. Madeleine McCann Kidnapping Suspect Christian Brueckner Hoarded Little Girl Swimsuits and Kiddie Porn Wolters believes that Brückner was commissioned to kidnap McCann for a pedophile sex ring that then killed her—likely because of the media attention to her case, which would have made it impossible to sell her on or use her in illegal under-age pornography. German police investigating Brückner found a cache of little girl swimsuits and volumes of kiddie porn in a camper van he was living in when he worked as a handyman at the resort at the time McCann disappeared. Wolter says the new proof they have is not forensic, but local media in Portugal say it may be threads of the girl’s pink pajamas that she was wearing when she was snatched from her bed back in May 2007. A lawyer for Brückner called the accusation “bullshit” to The Daily Mail, and said he was actually having sex with a woman he later took to the airport the evening McCann went missing. McCann disappeared on the evening of May 3, 2007, from a bedroom in her family’s resort hotel room as her parents ate tapas with friends a few hundred yards away. McCann, then nearly 4, was taken while her infant twin-siblings slept nearby. Gerry and Kate McCann had taken turns with friends to check on the sleeping kids at regular intervals while they enjoyed an evening out when they discovered the elder of the McCann children was gone, along with a blanket. Portuguese police first focused on McCann’s parents—both doctors—who they suggested gave their daughter a sleeping drug that accidentally killed her. After wasting months on the theory, they finally cleared the couple, but by then the trail to the real criminal or criminals had gone cold. Brückner has not been charged in connection to McCann’s disappearance and presumed murder, but police are now searching for the woman he says he was with that night who can either corroborate his alibi or shed light into what really happened to the British toddler all those years ago.

5/8/2022,"The FBI has found evidence implicating Suleiman Kerimov in US crimes. Authorities found documents when boarding the superyacht on Thursday, per Australia's ABC News. The Amadea was seized on Thursday by Fijian law enforcement at the request of US authorities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation found evidence incriminating the owner of a superyacht that was seized by Fijian authorities on Thursday, reports say. Australia's ABC News first reported the story. The US requested the seizure of Suleiman Kerimov's $325 million superyacht, which the FBI and Fijian law enforcement worked together to achieve. According to a statement from the Department of Justice, the seizure warrant was issued amid evidence the vessel ""Amadea"" was subject to forfeiture based on ""probable cause"" of violations of US law, money laundering, and conspiracy. The DOJ reported that court documents showed Kerimov owned the vessel after his designation as a Russian government official. The 350-foot superyacht was previously reported to be heading for the Fijian port of Nadi but is now located in Lautoka, Fiji. Its owner, Kerimov, is thought to be Russia's ninth-richest person with a fortune of around $14.5 billion, according to Forbes. He has been sanctioned by the US, EU, and the UK over alleged money laundering and his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kerimov is among individuals who have been sanctioned for being part of Vladimir Putin's close circles. The oligarchs have been scrutinized by the West and their assets have been seized, frozen, or detained. The US Department of Justice said in a statement on Thursday that according to court documents, Kerimov and those who acted on his behalf ""caused US dollar transactions to be routed through US financial institutions for the support and maintenance of the Amadea."" Insider previously reported that the maintenance cost of a superyacht can be up to 15% of its value. Vessels that are not properly maintained could cause environmental issues. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in the statement: ""This ruling should make clear that there is no hiding place for the assets of individuals who violate US laws. And there is no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime."" ""The Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable those who facilitate the death and destruction we are witnessing in Ukraine."" Western sanctions have prompted the seizure of superyachts, mansions, and private jets linked to some of Russia's richest people. Some have attempted to evade sanctions by moving their assets to friendly jurisdictions. Deputy attorney general Lisa O. Monaco said: ""This yacht seizure should tell every corrupt Russian oligarch that they cannot hide – not even in the remotest part of the world. We will use every means of enforcing the sanctions imposed in response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine.""
