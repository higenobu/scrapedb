3/16/2022,"An M.D. candidate explained why you should never use those automatic hand dryers in public bathrooms. TikToker @madmedicine is all about sharing “dope medical facts” to make health information more accessible. He recently shared a video about how those super convenient, contactless hand dryers actually don’t stop the spread of bacteria. They make it worse. Shop all of Christian Cowan’s high-fashion looks from his In The Know cover shoot: The medical student reacted to a popular TikTok trend where people use Dyson hand dryers to curl their hair. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but those hand dryers in public restrooms are extremely disgusting,” he explained. “There have been actual studies done on those hand dryers to see if they spread bacteria. Spoiler alert: They tend to spread more bacteria compared to just towels.” According to the Harvard Health blog, a 2018 study by the University of Connecticut and Quinnipiac University found that exposure to hot hand dryers exponentially grew bacteria colonies within a matter of seconds. “Every time a lidless toilet is flushed, it aerosolizes a fine mist of microbes. This fecal cloud may disperse over an area as large as 6 square meters (65 square feet),” Harvard Health stated. This means that each time someone flushes a toilet, particles of fecal bacteria spread through the air. When the bacteria comes in contact with a hot hand dryer, it multiplies. The best way to dry your hands and prevent bacteria from surviving on them is to use a paper towel.

3/16/2022,"The Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed a bill to make Daylight Saving Time permanent. If it passes through the House, Americans would no longer change their clocks twice a year. The Sunshine Protection Act, introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) but co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, seeks to bring the entire country in line with states like Florida which have already voted to end Standard Time, which runs from November to March. The senators sponsoring the bill explained a number of reasons to support it, including data that shows its negative health effects. Some studies have suggested permanent Daylight Saving Time could lead to fewer car accidents, lower rates of seasonal depression, and higher rates of physical activity, Rubio's press release outlined. It could potentially even boost economic activity and reduce energy usage, and would likely help employees like agricultural workers whose schedules are disrupted by time changes. ""Congress created Daylight Saving decades ago as a wartime effort,"" noted Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), arguing, ""now it is well past time to lock the clock and end this experiment.""

3/16/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A dissident legal scholar who was jailed for two years in China after participating in the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement was killed Monday in his law firm’s office in New York, where he had settled after seeking asylum in the U.S., police said. Li Jinjin, 66, was stabbed to death in the city where he had long worked as an immigration lawyer, even as he continued to advocate publicly for the many people jailed or killed by Chinese authorities during the nation’s democracy movement. An arrest was made in his killing. Police said Xiaoning Zhang, 25, was taken into custody and faces a murder charge. It wasn't immediately clear when she would be arraigned or if she had retained an attorney. Chuang Chuang Chen, the CEO of the China Democracy Party, and lawyer Wei Zhu, a friend of Li’s, both told The New York Daily News that the killing might have stemmed from Li’s refusal to take Zhang on as a client. Zhang came to the U.S. in August on an F-1 student visa to go to school in Los Angeles, Chen told the Daily News. Li, who also went by the first name Jim, was often quoted in recent years by news organizations looking for insight or commentary on the Chinese dissident community or on relations between China and the West. As an immigration lawyer, he also represented some Chinese expatriates living in the U.S. who were considered fugitives by that country. Prior to his imprisonment for protesting, Li had been a legal adviser to an independent labor union that had challenged China’s government on worker rights. “I can’t believe it. She not only destroyed his life, but the hope of our community,” Zhu told the newspaper. “He wanted to realize democracy in China.

3/16/2022,"China appears to be losing the battle to contain COVID-19, but it’s not yet ready to admit defeat. Facing the worst national outbreak since the first wave of the pandemic, authorities have introduced lockdown restrictions in cities across the country, with production lines falling idle in the tech hub of Shenzhen and offices shuttered in the financial capital Shanghai. Under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has stuck to a strict zero-COVID policy since the virus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, locking down entire cities whenever cases emerge and using mass testing and strict quarantining to bring local outbreaks under control. But Chinese virologists say the arrival of the Omicron variant and its new “stealth” subvariant—both of which appear to evade China’s Sinovac vaccine—could leave that policy in tatters. For those in the Americas or Europe, the case numbers reported from China still seem pretty small: Authorities confirmed 1,337 new locally transmitted cases in mainland China on Monday. By contrast, the U.K. is currently seeing more than 200,000 cases a day, according to the main COVID tracker. But the example of Hong Kong, the former British colony that is officially semi-autonomous, is worrying. Omicron appears to be running virtually unchecked through the population of the island territory, which has registered an average of 40,000 cases a day over the past week despite widespread vaccination. Worst-hit on the mainland is the northeastern province of Jilin, bordering North Korea, where many residents are restricted to their homes except for grocery shopping trips every other day. Jilin has recorded more than 4,000 cases in the past fortnight. But multiple smaller outbreaks have also been recorded. Shenzhen, a city of 17.5 million people bordering Hong Kong, registered 66 new cases on Saturday, prompting authorities to suspend public transport, close factories—among them the huge Foxconn plant that produces the Apple iPhone. Residents have been told to stay home for the next week except when they are called for three rounds of compulsory testing. A prominent infectious-disease expert from Shanghai, Zhang Wenhong, said in an article for the Chinese business outlet Caixin that the outbreak was being driven by the Omicron BA.2 “stealth” subvariant, the most infectious lineage yet of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. The Only Way to Resolve the Wuhan ‘Lab Leak’ Controversy Zhang, whose plain-spoken appeals for people to put up with lockdown restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic made him a prominent figure, said that the case numbers suggested the beginning of an “exponential rise”—but China had no option but to try to contain the virus. “If our country opens up quickly now, it will cause a large number of infections in people in a short period of time,” Zhang wrote, according to a translation carried by the Associated Press. “No matter how low the death rate is, it will still cause a run on medical resources and a short-term shock to social life, causing irreparable harm to families and society.” Foxconn, Apple’s manufacturing partner, said it would use its “diversified production sites in China” to minimize the impact of the Shenzhen lockdown. But from a wider economic viewpoint, the lockdowns—both in Shenzhen and the industrial hub of Dongguan—could hardly have come at a worse time. Panic selling saw Chinese tech stocks listed on the Hong Kong exchange fall 11 percent on Monday—their worst single-day fall since the 2008 crash—because of wider fears that China could be dragged into the conflict in Ukraine, or that Chinese companies doing business in Russia might face Western sanctions. If China sticks with its zero-COVID policy, despite the spread of Omicron, one option is to insist that manufacturers introduce “closed management” systems, where workers live and work in a COVID-free “bubble.” The Chinese used such a system to protect last month’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, where staff and volunteers wore hazmat suits to marshal and test visiting athletes and even robots to feed them. Making that work in a megacity like Shenzhen or Shanghai would be harder. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

Esco was detained shortly thereafter when officers saw him still outside the building. Yonkers police announced the arrest and released security video from the building’s vestibule area Monday. The video shows the woman was trying to open the second door into the lobby when she was hit on the head from behind and fell to the ground. Video shows she was punched 125 times, stomped on seven more times and spat on.

3/16/2022,"A couple in Pennsylvania were surprised at the legal trouble they found themselves in after they tried to spend the night inside of a Target to film a YouTube video. Johnson Larose and his girlfriend Charlotte Fischer co-run the YouTube channel called Saucy and Honey. The channel has more than 21,000 subscribers and features the couple doing viral challenges and pranking each other. See this bedroom turn into a vibrant oasis after an incredible one-day renovation: In one video that they posted on Feb. 21 titled “24 HOUR OVERNIGHT CHALLENGE IN TARGET (CAUGHT?!?),” Larose and Fischer filmed themselves walking into a Target 30 minutes before it closed and then hiding in order to stay at the store overnight. “Guys do not attempt what we are attempting at home. We are entertainers. We are risking trespassing. I don’t know what else can happen after that. If we get a fine or get arrested, I don’t really know. I don’t really care,” Fischer said in the video. Fischer added that they wouldn’t be stealing anything from Target and supplied their own water bottles and snacks, as well as wipes and mason jars, should they need to use the bathroom. The couple set up a fort out of product boxes on the bottom of a shelf until the store’s lights went off and then they wandered around the aisles filming themselves. Then, at 8 a.m. the next day, Larose and Fischer left Target. In addition to uploading a video that showed footage of them in the Target after hours, Fox 29 Philadelphia reported that officers were called to the store at 3 a.m. the night they slept over after an alarm went off. Police said they searched the building but did not find anyone. The next day, however, after learning about the alarm going off, Target employees watched security footage and saw a couple walking around the store after hours with their phones out — presumably Larose and Fischer. “It became a little bit bigger of an investigation, trying to find out what they were doing, was there something criminal?” police detective Scott Pezick said at the time. Security footage allegedly confirmed that Larose and Fischer did not take anything from the store. The footage also indicated that Larose and Fischer left through an emergency exit door at 3 a.m. — setting off the alarm — and then returned to the store at 8 a.m. to finish filming. Now both Larose and Fischer are facing charges of third-degree criminal trespassing and conspiracy and were released on a $25,000 unsecured bail. Third-degree trespassing is when someone unlawfully enters or remains in or upon a premise that isn’t theirs — even if it’s a public place like Target. For the time being, Larose and Fischer are not allowed to visit any Target stores in Pennsylvania and their next hearing is on March 24. “I mean, no regrets, just living life and having fun, it’s kind of sad that all of this came out of it, we were expecting a fine, nothing crazy,” Fischer said, according to Fox 29.

3/16/2022,"The collapse of Sarah Bloom Raskin's bid to be the Federal Reserve's top banking cop shows how deeply oil industry allies in Congress are dug in against weaving climate change into financial oversight. Catch up fast: Raskin withdrew her nomination on Tuesday a day after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va) announced opposition to her nomination as vice chair of the Federal Reserve, effectively dooming her chances amid unified GOP opposition. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Why it matters: The stiff headwinds facing this nomination demonstrate how much resistance there is among the fossil fuel industry and its allies in Congress to integrating climate change risk analysis into the work of the country's top financial regulatory institution. It's not the analysis that worries opponents of her nomination, but where such studies might lead. The big picture: Progressives and climate activists championed Raskin's nomination because they were eager to see someone with extensive knowledge of the ways in which climate change, through extreme weather and climate events, related geopolitical upheaval and other effects, poses economic risks. Not having her in the powerful role of vice chair of supervision means big banks will have less (but not zero) reason to worry about continuing to finance fossil fuel projects and plan for climate-related financial shocks. The intrigue: The unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine impeded the Raskin nomination as well, since it helped cause gas prices skyrocket, and underscored the importance of relying more on domestically-produced energy. Manchin has argued for increasing U.S. oil and gas drilling in response to the war. In Raskin, Manchin saw an impediment to that vision. So too did many oil and gas companies and their trade groups, which lined up in opposition to her nomination, while environmental groups supported her. Zoom in: In announcing his opposition to Raskin's nomination, Manchin pointed to her climate views, stating: ""Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation’s critical energy needs."" Her writings as an academic show that not only does she think the Fed should ensure that banks get prepared for the consequences of climate change, but also that banks and their regulators should play a positive role in a clean energy transition, shifting funding away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy. She played down the role of the Fed in picking energy winners and losers during her January testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, though ranking member Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) did not buy the reversal, dismissing it as a ""confirmation conversion."" Between the lines: Assuming Raskin is forced to bow out, the Banking Committee Republicans' tactic of boycotting attempts to vote on Biden's recent Fed nominees will have paid off.

Brent crude futures fell $1.82, or 1.6%, to $110.85 a barrel by 6:47 p.m. ET (2247 GMT). WTI crude futures fell $2.41, or 2.2%, to $106.92 a barrel. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" has roiled energy markets globally. Brent last week was down 4.8% after hitting $139.13 on March 7.

Peskov made the comments after Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukraine and Russia were actively conducting talks on Sunday. Russia said on Sunday it was counting on China to help it withstand the economic blow from Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but the United States warned Beijing not to provide that lifeline.

3/16/2022,"It was an especially inspiring story of Ukrainian bravery, in a war replete with many of them. In video that spread quickly online on March 2, Artem Semenikhin, the mayor of the small city of Konotop, in northeastern Ukraine, stood on a planter outside the City Council and announced to a crowd that Russian soldiers had told him they would “raze the city to the ground with their artillery” if it did not surrender. Then Semenikhin asked the crowd whether they wanted to fight anyway, and the response was overwhelmingly in favor. The video was picked up by Western media outlets including Newsweek, the Daily Mail and the New York Times, which also showed a video of armed Russian troops being jeered by Konotop residents. Semenikhin was also featured in a ""PBS NewsHour"" segment, in which he referred to the Russian troops as “cockroaches.” There was just one thing missing from those accounts: the fact that Semenikhin is a member of the far-right, ultranationalist Ukrainian political party Svoboda, which emerged in 2004 from the former Social-National Party of Ukraine. In 2015, shortly after Semenikhin took office, the Jerusalem Post reported that he “refused to fly the city’s official flag at the opening meeting of the city council because he objected to the star of David emblazoned on it.” The newspaper also alleged he uses white supremacist dog whistles. Alan MacLeod, a writer for the far-left website MintPress News noted on Twitter that in Semenikhin’s interview with PBS, conducted remotely via video, one can see a painting of Ukrainian nationalist icon Stepan Bandera in the background. During World War II, Bandera led the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which collaborated with Nazi Germany and killed Polish and Jewish civilians. At the time, Nazi troops were invading the Soviet Union, which Ukrainian nationalists were hoping to break away from. Bandera later had a falling out with the Nazi regime and was imprisoned in a concentration camp. He remains a highly controversial figure in Ukraine. After Semenikhin was elected in 2015, he replaced the portrait in the mayor’s office of then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko with one of Bandera. As a pretext for his invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly sought to connect the entire Ukrainian government to Nazis, vowing to “de-Nazify” the Kyiv regime. But Putin’s claim is absurd, based on the facts: Semenikhin's city of Konotop had only about 80,000 people before the war, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is one of the few Jewish leaders on the world stage and says he had many relatives killed in the Holocaust. Russia has been lodging this false accusation for years. In 2014, Russian state propaganda claimed the Maidan Revolution was also backed by Nazis as the pro-Western protesters toppled Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovych. Experts on Ukraine characterized that assertion as “entirely baseless,” according to U.S. News & World Report. That being said, like many European countries, Ukraine does have far-right, nationalist political parties with racist tendencies. Svoboda, Semenikhin’s party, has had a number of incidents that drew widespread condemnation. Svoboda’s leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, has been accused of racism and antisemitism for such comments as saying Ukraine was headed by a “Muscovite-Jewish mafia.” On April 20, 2018 — Adolf Hitler’s birthday — the youth movement of Svoboda, C14, destroyed a Roma settlement in Kyiv by driving out its residents and burning down their tents. It’s worth noting, however, that Svoboda no longer holds any seats in Ukraine’s parliament, whereas far-right nationalists hold seats in the parliaments of at least 19 other European countries, including Hungary, Austria, Switzerland and Denmark.",World/Yahoo News,"Ukrainian mayor, heralded by many, is ultranationalist",https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-mayor-heralded-by-many-is-ultranationalist-161819300.html

It is owned by Kirill Shamalov, the ex-husband of Putin's daughter, Russian news site The Insider reported. The activists, who were briefly arrested, say they want to house Ukrainian refugees in the villa. A group of activists said they took over a French seaside villa belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin's former son-in-law, saying they want to use it to house Ukrainian refugees. Pierre Haffner, Vladimir Osechkin, and Sergey Saveliev posted videos and images showing an activist flying the Ukrainian flag from the balcony of the Alta Maria villa in Biarritz on Sunday. The house, which the activists said has eight bedrooms and three bathrooms, is registered to Kirill Shamalov, the independent Russian investigative website The Insider reported. Shamalov was previously married to Katerina Tikhonova, one of Putin's daughters. The villa was previously registered to the Russian oligarch Gennady Timchenko, The Insider reported. Insider was not able to independently verify the property ownership details. Haffner told The Insider that they had found a copy of Shamalov's passport inside the property. Here's a video of Saveliev walking inside the villa compound. Here's a video showing images from inside the mansion, according to Haffner. On Monday, Biarritz police arrested Haffner and Saveliev in connection with the break-in, but later released them with a warning, Agence France-Presse and Reuters reported. In their social media posts, the activists said they changed the locks and hoped to house Ukrainian refugees in the villa. They also said they will go to IKEA to get furnishings. ""In the coming days, human rights activists and lawyers will send relevant requests to the Biarritz Mayor's Office and the prefecture, as well as the Elysee Palace with a proposal to use the villa 'Ukraine' as one of the places to accommodate refugees from Ukraine,"" Osechkin wrote on Facebook.

3/16/2022,"A New York City woman is accused of kidnapping and torturing a man she met on Instagram for more than 12 hours while demanding a $100,000 ransom from his brother, authorities said on Tuesday. Valerie Rosario, 21, allegedly ""lured"" the unidentified victim, 24, to a Bronx apartment on Feb. 7, the New York City Police Department said. At least two men with firearms allegedly waited until he went inside and then entered the apartment after him. One of the men hit the victim with a pistol, according to a complaint provided by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. The suspects undressed the victim and put him in a bathtub, the complaint states. They then poured flammable liquid on him, burned him with a flame, and repeatedly stabbed him with a knife, it alleges. Around 2:40 p.m., the victim's brother said he received a FaceTime call and saw three masked individuals surrounding the victim, the complaint states. One of the suspects cut the victim while stating, “Give us $100,000 or we will kill him,"" according to the complaint. Police said the victim was later driven from the Bronx apartment to a location in Queens, where a detective saw one of the suspects in a van with a knife. The suspect, Javier Vargas, 24, of the Bronx, was arrested on Feb. 7 and charged with robbery, assault, kidnapping, and unlawful imprisonment.

3/16/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — They are idealists who abandoned their jobs for the battlefields of Ukraine, looking for a cause or simply to fight. The Ukrainian president’s call for foreign volunteers to join an international brigade to help bolster his country’s defense with a new layer of resistance to Russia’s invasion is for now a ragtag army. Recruits say they are often waiting for weapons and training, leaving them feeling exposed. “Pure hell: fire, shouting, panic. And a lot more bombs and missiles.” That is how Swedish volunteer Jesper Söder described Sunday’s attack on Yavoriv, the military training base in western Ukraine pounded by Russian missiles that killed 35 people, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia said the death toll was much higher. Söder said he led a group of foreigners including Scandinavians, British and Americans out of the base and back across the nearby Polish border. He told The Associated Press by phone from Krakow, Poland, that he said he didn’t know how many foreign volunteers were being trained at the base but estimated they were in the hundreds. Unlike Söder, who fought alongside Kurdish fighters in Syria against Islamic State group militants, many of the volunteers at Yavoriv had no previous military training, he said. Foreigners — some of whom have never handled a firearm yet but are ready to die — have arrived in Ukraine from other European countries, the United States and elsewhere. They are hoping to get equipped, instructed and made battle-ready. But some arrive to discover that there are no weapons, protective gear or proper training in a multilingual force short on organization and breeding a sense of chaos. Threats by Russia to target what it calls foreign “mercenaries,” as it said it did at the Yavoriv base, increase the level of risk. “It’s chaotic right now. It’s disorganized, and you can get yourself in trouble very quickly if you’re not with a sensible switched-on group of people,” said Matthew Robinson, a British man from the northern England county of Yorkshire who had been living in southern Spain. Robinson and several other volunteer fighters were interviewed this weekend on the outskirts of Lviv, where foreign fighers are receiving training and instruction. A recent arrival, Robinson is remaining cautious as he tries to sort things out. He said that there are “multiple legions, lots of false promises, lots of misinformation.” In addition, there is a “massive language barrier” and “a lot of people here who haven’t fired weapons.” Russia’s threats to target what it calls “mercenaries” compounds the dangers facing foreign fighters. Russia has claimed it killed 180 “mercenaries” in Sunday’s training base attack, and Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Russian forces will show “no mercy for mercenaries wherever they are on the territory of Ukraine.” The Russian military is tracking foreign fighters’ movements and will strike again, he said. Söder's account of the attack on the training base suggested it was not an indiscriminate strike. Söder said the bombing of the base was different from anything he had experienced. “They knew exactly what to hit. They knew exactly where our weapons storage was. They knew exactly where the administration building was. They hit the nail on the head with all their missiles,” he told the AP. Jericho Skye, 26, a Montana native who served in the U.S. Army military police, was relieved he based himself in Kyiv, the capital, far from the attack in the west, all the more so because he was awaiting weapons at a makeshift base. He keeps alive hope that arms soon will be distributed and his belief that Ukrainians are doing their best in a dire situation. “We’re pretty upset that we’re in the middle of a combat zone with small arms fire on the road, bombs being dropped almost every day and we haven’t been given our weapons yet just because of bureaucracy and paperwork,” he said. Skye spoke in a telephone call from Paris from what he described as a makeshift collection post for foreign fighters in Kyiv, which he reached last week, making his way there a day after arriving in Ukraine. “This is my first war,” Skye said. He came to Ukraine “to help protect,” not “do logistics,” he said, motivated by images of innocent civilians being targeted. And when he “saw no other countries were going to be able to reinforce Ukrainian troops, I felt a moral obligation to join the fighting,” he added. NATO nations have ruled out direct combat and air defense that Ukraine is pleading for, with leaders saying that could trigger a third world war. “It’s just them against the entire Russian military,” Skye said, noting Moscow’s call for war-hardened mercenaries from Syria to beef up its own ranks. “It’s a little disorganized. Its nobody’s fault,” he added. “They weren’t really expecting to be invaded, be thrown into a war,” he said. But death is not on his radar. “I’m very keenly aware of the situation,” But he added, “I’m going to do my very best to come home.” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the creation of a foreign defense legion in late February, apparently surprising everyone, including embassies tasked with lending a hand. It wasn't clear how many people from across the globe have joined Ukraine’s international brigade. Zelenskyy said at one point that there were 16,000. The figure, which would now be outdated, couldn't be confirmed, but based on interviews in Ukraine and in some European capitals, a motley volunteer war effort is shaping up. Skye said volunteers from all points of the globe were with him in Kyiv, but wouldn't give a number, calling that “sensitive information.” En route to the Ukraine battlefields was Tristan Lombardo, a 22-year-old from Evansville, Illinois. “I feel like it’s the right thing to do, and that’s the best way to get your passions, in life,” he said in an interview Monday at the Polish border. “If it’s a passion, it’s a passion that I’m willing to die for,” Lombardo said, adding that he was nervous but not fearful. There was clear evidence that at least some Ukrainian embassies were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of foreigners for Ukraine’s cause. In Paris, Ukrainian volunteers, including students, stood on the sidewalk to advise would-be fighters arriving from Bordeaux, Rouen and elsewhere in France to submit an electronic form. A 27-year-old New York state “relatively successful” business owner and former paratrooper in the Israeli military told the AP on the Polish border that he talked directly with Ukrainian army officials. He said “they got overwhelmed,” especially by those with no previous training. He identified himself only as Alexander, saying he hadn’t informed his parents of his plans to fight but signed up because, as a former paratrooper, he felt an “absolute responsibility” to help people of Ukraine. His “cue,” he said, was seeing rabbis drafted into the army and given AK-47s. Saving democracy is among top motives often cited by would-be foreign fighters, and some in place. But saving Ukraine has also become an attractive cause for the far right, neo-Nazis and white supremacists, providing a chance to fight. Recruiting chats on the encrypted Telegram messaging app are run by the Azov Regiment, popular with neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and American neo-Nazis work to recruit for Azov, the respected SITE Intelligence Group says. Azov Regiment originated as a far-right paramilitary unit and is now a subset of the Ukrainian military, according to SITE. A Chicago police officer who quit his job to join Zelenskyy’s defense brigade has high-minded motives for what he sees as a noble cause. Harrison Jozefowicz, who spent five years in the U.S. Army, sees himself, firstly, as a “facilitator.” “There are war crimes being committed here and refugees fleeing in the millions. And I know that I am needed here more right now” than at the Chicago Police Department, he said in an interview on the outskirts of Lviv. He conceded that his family “thought I was a little crazy.” His Task Force Yankee Ukraine, on Facebook, seeks to get Americans into Ukraine safely. While 90% of respondents have military training, “we’re not turning anybody away right now,” he said, including mechanics or doctors with needed skills. Still, British citizen Matthew Robinson stressed caution for foreigners eager to help the war effort on the ground. “If any single person was thinking of coming here, organize yourself into groups and set yourself some limits” and seek information before arriving, Robinson said. “Because you can be railroaded into a legion and sent to the front line very quickly,” he said. He added, “Even though you’ve got the best of intentions to help people, you could basically be cannon fodder.” ——- Elaine Ganley reported from Paris. Karl Ritter in Berlin, Jan M.

3/16/2022,"Elon Musk on Monday advised his Twitter followers to ""own physical things"" when inflation is high. He seemed to make an exception for bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin, saying he won't sell his holdings. Musk, the world's richest person, said in 2020 that he'd sell ""almost all"" his physical belongings. Elon Musk on Monday advised that it's ""better to own physical things"" like homes and stocks — but added that he wouldn't sell his bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin holdings. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the world's richest person, said it was better to own physical things instead of US dollars when inflation was running high. He appeared to make an exception for cryptocurrencies, though. In a Twitter thread discussing inflation, Musk said: ""As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high."" He added: ""I still own & won't sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw."" Inflation in the US hit 7.9% year-on-year in February, its highest level since 1982, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Musk said Tesla and SpaceX were ""seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics."" Musk announced in May 2020 that he planned to sell ""almost all"" his physical belongings, including his multimillion-dollar property portfolio. He sold his last remaining home in December 2021. The billionaire entrepreneur is an advocate of cryptocurrencies, albeit with caveats. He's regularly voiced support for dogecoin and discussed the merits of crypto with leading figures from the tech industry. Tesla said it bought about $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in early 2021, to be used as a hedge against inflation. Tesla's share price has fallen by about 35% this year, lowering Musk's fortune by about a quarter — but he's still the richest person in the world, with a net worth of about $206 billion, Bloomberg's Billionaires Index estimated. Commodity prices were already on the upswing on the back of supply-chain disruptions as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month added to supply-side strains to the energy, metals, and grains markets, because both countries are leading suppliers.

3/16/2022,"March 13 (Reuters) - Bermuda's aviation regulator said it is suspending certification of many Russian airplanes in the British overseas territory due to international sanctions over the war in Ukraine. ""International sanctions on the aviation sector have had a significant impact on the ability to sustain safety oversight on Russian-operated aircraft,"" Bermuda's Civil Aviation Authority said on its website https://bit.ly/3Iai2st late on Saturday. No air carrier is permitted to fly without a certificate of airworthiness, which is issued by the civil aviation authority in the country where it is registered. The regulator said it is ""unable to confidently approve these aircraft as being airworthy"", and therefore as of late March 12, ""suspended all Certificates of Airworthiness of those aircraft operating under the Article 83bis Agreement between Bermuda and the Russian Federation"". Mutual air closures by the European Union and Moscow over the war in Ukraine have left Russian aviation in near isolation. Sanctions imposed by the EU in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine give leasing firms until March 28 to free themselves from deals with Russian airlines. BCAA's move furthers piles on the pressure since most of the foreign-owned planes operated by Russian carriers under lease are registered in Bermuda. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and ""de-Nazify"" the country.

Except instead of a plea to help animals escape abusive environments, this one’s a mock PSA for Republicans suffering from “Partisan Derangement Syndrome” who are “too far gone” to be saved: The ad is set to run in the D.C. market on “Fox & Friends” next week ― reportedly one of Trump’s favorite shows. “This ad shows the ridiculous lengths these Republicans will go to try to remain in Trump’s good graces,” Sarah Longwell, the organization’s executive director, said in a news release. “They know Trump’s lies about the 2020 election and actions on January 6 were wrong, but they lack the courage to take a stand and say they won’t support him.” The Republican Accountability Project, a group of “never Trump” conservatives, has been calling out members of the GOP who enabled the former president, especially during and after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol that was carried out by his supporters.

3/16/2022,"By Jacqueline Thomsen (Reuters) - As thousands of would-be fighters from outside the country volunteer to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's invasion, some may also face legal consequences in their home countries. Citizens of Canada, Georgia, India, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States are among the volunteers, Reuters and other media organizations have reported. Below is a summary of some of the laws governing foreigners who have signed up for Ukraine's ""international legion."" IS IT LEGAL FOR AMERICANS TO VOLUNTEER? U.S. citizens are not barred from serving in another country's military, the State Department's website says. Serving as an officer or fighting against a country that is at peace with the United States can be grounds for giving up citizenship voluntarily, but Supreme Court precedent says foreign military service alone cannot be used to strip Americans of citizenship. A separate U.S. law dating back to 1794, the Neutrality Act, prohibits citizens from making war against foreign governments at peace with Washington and carries a prison sentence of up to three years. The law, which could technically apply to volunteer military action against Russia, was used to prosecute Americans involved in an attempted coup in Gambia in 2014. But otherwise it has been rarely enforced in modern history, according to David Malet, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C. ""Absent links to domestic terrorism, it’s hard for me to imagine Americans being prosecuted for going to Ukraine,"" Malet said. WHAT ABOUT AUSTRALIAN, BRITISH AND INDIAN VOLUNTEERS? Britons traveling to Ukraine to fight could be subject to prosecution upon return, according to a UK Foreign Office travel advisory https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine/safety-and-security last updated Wednesday. Asked by Reuters what charges would apply to UK volunteers, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office declined to comment. The United Kingdom's Foreign Enlistment Act, last updated in 1870, blocks citizens from joining foreign militaries fighting countries at peace with Britain, but it has not been applied to modern conflicts. The UK Foreign Secretary initially voiced support for citizen volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but later warned against any travel there. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has urged his country’s citizens not to join the military fight in Ukraine, telling reporters last month that there are ""uncertainties"" about the legal position of foreign civilian combatants. The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs did not respond to a request for comment about the legality of Indian citizens joining the Ukraine forces. In a case involving Indians traveling to Iraq in 2015, the ministry told the Delhi High Court that allowing Indians to participate in another country's conflict ""would lead to the allegation that the Indian government is promoting terrorism in other countries."" HAVE ANY COUNTRIES GIVEN THE ALL-CLEAR? Germany has said it will not prosecute volunteers who join the fighting, and Danish and Latvian leaders said they would allow their citizens to volunteer. Canadian defense minister Anita Anand has said whether Canadians volunteer is ""an individual decision."" WHAT IF FOREIGN FIGHTERS ARE CAPTURED IN UKRAINE? International law requires Russian forces to treat foreign fighters as prisoners of war, regardless of their nationality, said Daphné Richemond-Barak, a professor with the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy in Israel. That means Russian soldiers must give volunteers who are captured food, water and medical treatment. However, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman last week said Western ""mercenaries"" fighting for Ukraine would not be treated as lawful combatants and would face criminal prosecution or worse, according to Russian news agency TASS. COULD VOLUNTEERS BE PROSECUTED FOR WARTIME CONDUCT? Because volunteers will be fighting as members of the Ukrainian army, they are unlikely to face charges in their home country over their specific actions in the war, with the exception of prosecution for war crimes or similar conduct, experts say.

3/16/2022,"Russia's former chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, told the BBC that Roman Abramovich made ""fraudulent deals."" Skuratov investigated Abramovich's purchase of Russian gas company Sibneft in 1995. Abramovich bought Sibneft in 1995 for $250 million. A decade later, he sold it back for $13 billion. Russia's former chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, has told the BBC that Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich gained his wealth through ""fraudulent deals."" A BBC investigation looked into how Abramovich made his money, focusing on deals that he conducted with the Russian government in the 1990s. According to the report, in 1995 Abramovich purchased Russian oil company Sibneft from the government at an auction for $250 million – and sold it back for $13 billion a decade later. The report, citing Skuratov and a confidential source, alleged that Abramovich initially bought the company at a ""rigged auction"" through a ""fraudulent scheme"" with his former business associate, Boris Berezovsky. A representative for Abramovich did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Skuratov served as Russia's Prosecutor General from 1995 to 1999 and investigated the deal at the time. ""Basically, it was a fraudulent scheme, where those who took part in the privatization formed one criminal group that allowed Abramovich and Berezovsky to trick the government and not pay the money that this company was really worth,"" Skuratov told BBC. Skuratov was forced to resign in 1999 after a political battle with then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin which culminated in the release of a video allegedly showing Skuratov in his office with two sex workers. The purported authenticity of the video was confirmed by Vladimir Putin, then the head of the FSB, Russia's spy agency. It was released just as Skuratov planned to share the names of Russian oligarchs taking bribes from a Swiss firm. ""This whole thing was obviously political, because in my investigations I came very close to the family of Boris Yeltsin, including via this investigation of the Sibneft privatization,"" Skuratov added. According to the BBC, in 2012 Berezovsky sued Abramovich, arguing that he had coerced him into selling Sibneft shares by blackmailing him. He sought billions of dollars in damages. Berezovsky lost the case. But, according to the BBC, Abramovich testified at the trial that he gave Berezovsky $10 million at the time of the Sibneft purchase to pay off a Russian official. Last Thursday, Abramovich was formally sanctioned by the UK government for ""preferential treatment and concessions from Putin."" His assets in the country, including Chelsea FC, were seized by the UK government. The soccer club will use a special license from the government to keep operating for the remainder of its season. Abramovich, who has an estimated net worth of $13.6 billion, purchased Chelsea's parent company in 2003 for $230 million.

Both Russian and Ukrainian negotiators have voiced cautious optimism but haven’t spelled out any details of talks. ___ HERE ARE TODAY'S KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: — U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Europe next week for face-to-face talks with European leaders about Russia's invasion — Russia has stepped up its bombardment of Kyiv, as a series of strikes hit a residential neighborhood in the capital city — The European Union has imposed new sanctions, including measures that target Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich — The leaders of three European Union countries have traveled to Kyiv — Fox News says two of its journalists were killed in Ukraine when the vehicle he was traveling in was struck by incoming fire Go to https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine for updates throughout the day. ___ HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY: KYIV, Ukraine — A senior Ukrainian official says about 20,000 people have managed to leave the besieged port city of Mariupol. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of office of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the evacuees left Mariupol in private vehicles via a humanitarian corridor on Tuesday. He said that 570 of some 4,000 vehicles that left the city have reached the city of Zaporizhzhia some 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest while others will spend the night in various towns along the way. Mariupol, a strategic port city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov, has been besieged by Russian troops for more than 10 days, facing heavy shelling that has killed more than 2,300 people and left residents struggling for food, water, heat and medicine. ___ WASHINGTON — Russian ground troops have made limited progress over the last 24 hours in their effort to seize major cities in Ukraine, a senior defense official said Tuesday. And as deadly airstrikes continue, the U.S. has seen indications that Russia may believe it needs more troops and supplies than it has on hand in the country, and is considering ways to get resources brought in, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military assessments. The official did not elaborate on the indications, and said that as of Tuesday, however, there has been no actual movement of reinforcement troops currently in Russia going into Ukraine. According to the official, Russian ground forces are still about 15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) northwest of Kyiv and 20-30 kilometers (12-19 miles) east of the city, which is being increasingly hit by long-range strikes. The official said Ukrainian troops continue to put up stiff resistance in Kharkiv and other areas. Russia has launched more than 950 missiles so far in the war, and both Russia and Ukraine still retain about 90% of their combat power, the official said. ___ Associated Press Writer Lolita Bandor contributed to this report. ___ MEDYKA, Poland — Refugees continued to pour into Poland on Tuesday at a border crossing connecting Ukraine to the Polish village of Medyka. Ludmila Deslichenko, 41, traveled from Cherkasy in central Ukraine. “We would like to go back home as soon as the war ends and when there’s peace,” Deslichenko said. “It was very terrifying. There were bombs during the day, also rockets, everywhere in Ukraine. There were a lot of explosions. As soon as it calms down and the war is over, we will go back.” Oksana Voloshen, 59, said she crossed the border to buy groceries to bring back to Mostyska in far western Ukraine. “We have nothing in the shops,” she said. Nicolas Kusiak, who leads NGOs and volunteers at the Medyka border crossing, said that while they’re seeing mostly refugees entering Poland, some are headed the other way. “We have a lot of military, ex-military from all over the world, the (United) States, U.K., Germany, Denmark, even Poland, joining the international legion,” Kusiak said. ___ KYIV, Ukraine — A senior aide to Ukraine’s president says that Russia has softened its stance in the talks over a possible settlement. Ihor Zhovkva, a deputy chief of staff to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Tuesday that the talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives have become “more constructive” and Russia has changed tone and stopped airing demands for Ukraine to surrender — something Russia had insisted upon during earlier stages of talks. Three rounds of talks in Belarus earlier this month have been followed by video calls between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, including the one on Tuesday. Zhovkva said that Ukrainian representatives feel “moderately optimistic” after the talks, adding that it would be necessary for Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to make major progress. ___ ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s foreign minister is traveling to Moscow as part of efforts to secure a cease-fire. Mevlut Cavusoglu would hold talks in Moscow on Wednesday before traveling to Ukraine for talks on Thursday, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday. In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said the Polish President Andrzej Duda would be visiting Turkey on Wednesday for talks expected to focus on the crisis. Last week the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met on the sidelines of a diplomacy forum organized by Turkey, although their talks failed to produce a breakthrough. ___ BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — Slovakia’s Parliament has approved a NATO plan to deploy up to 2,100 troops on Slovak territory following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The plan is part of the NATO initiative to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending forces to help protect them. Germany is supposed to contribute the biggest number of soldiers, up to 700, to the multinational battlegroup. The Czech Republic follows with 600 and the U.S. will send up to 400. The Netherlands, Poland and Slovenia will also contribute troops. Their deployment together with the Patriot air defense system will increase the defensive capabilities of Slovakia’s armed forces. The alliance stationed troops in the Baltic countries — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — and Poland after the 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula by Russia. After Russia attacked Ukraine, NATO decided to boost its presence along the entire eastern flank by deploying forces in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. ___ MILAN — Italian museums said Tuesday that they had gotten a reprieve from a Russian request to immediately repatriate artworks on loan from the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg. The director of the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg said in a message relayed Monday by the Hermitage Italia collection that an agreement had been reached with Russian cultural officials so that “the paintings of Titian and Picasso can continue to remain on the walls of museums,” at Palazzo Reale in Milan and the Fondazione Alda Fendi in Rome. The same goes for works on loan to the Gallerie d’Italia, owned by bank Intesa Sanpaolo, in Milan. Russian cultural officials had requested the immediate repatriation of the works last week as cultural ties frayed along with the diplomatic tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Hermitage director general, Michail Piotrovsky, expressed regret “that cultural relations between our countries have collapsed into such ‘darkness.’ It can recover only if we conserve an atmosphere of good will and benevolence. We always repeat that the bridges of culture are the last to blow up. It is time to protect them.” ___ BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says he’s convened a summit for next week of the military organization’s 30 leaders to discuss Russia’s war on Ukraine. Stoltenberg says the March 24 summit will be led by U.S. President Joe Biden and “will address the consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO’s deterrence and defense in response to a new reality for our security.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that Biden will travel to Brussels for the face-to-face talks with European leaders. The trip follows on Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to eastern flank NATO countries of Poland and Romania last week to discuss with leaders the growing refugee crisis in eastern Europe sparked by the Russian invasion and to underscore the Biden administration’s support for NATO allies. Stoltenberg said in a statement Tuesday that “at this critical time, North America and Europe must continue to stand together in NATO.” NATO has been bolstering its eastern flank with troops and equipment to deter Russia from invading any of its members. NATO refuses to deploy troops to Ukraine as it is concerned about sparking a wider war in Europe. ___ An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program by protesting the war in Ukraine was ordered to pay a fine by a Russian court Tuesday. Marina Ovsyannikova, an employee of the Russian Channel 1, walked into the studio during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “no war” and “Russians against the war.” In a video recorded before her action, Ovsyannikova said that her father is Ukrainian and her mother Russian. She urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vlaidmir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.” Ovsyannikova spent the night in police custody, and Moscow’s Ostankino District Court on Tuesday ordered Ovsyannikova to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war. ___ BRUSSELS — The European Union has slapped sanctions on Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia. The EU included the Russian oligarch in its updated list of individuals facing assets freeze and travel bans over their role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old Abramovich had already been punished in Britain by Boris Johnson’s administration last week. The aluminum magnate was among seven wealthy Russians who had their assets frozen under British sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich has also been suspended as director of the Premier League club. The EU said Abramovich “has had privileged access to the president, and has maintained very good relations with him. This connection with the Russian leader helped him to maintain his considerable wealth.” ___ The Russian Foreign Ministry says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly, Defense Minister Anita Anand and other Canadian officials have been put on a sanctions list. The ministry said in Tuesday’s statement that they have been barred from entering Russia in retaliation to Canadian sanctions against the Russian leadership. The Russian sanctions also targeted Canadian lawmakers. The ministry said the decision was a forced move taken in response to “hostile actions by the current Canadian regime that has long tested our patience.” The decision followed the announcement of Russian sanctions against U.S. President Joe Biden and senior members of his administration. ___ The Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow is withdrawing from the Council of Europe. The ministry said it handed a formal notice about Russia’s decision to leave the continent’s leading human rights organization to the Council of Europe’s Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić on Tuesday. It said the move followed the Council of Europe’s decision to suspend Russia’s membership that was taken on Feb. 25. The ministry charged that the Council of Europe has become an instrument of exerting pressure on Russia and alleged that it has been heavily influenced by NATO and the European Union. It said in a statement that its withdrawal from the Council of Europe wouldn’t impact human rights and freedoms in the country, which officials said are safeguarded by the Russian constitution. Russia’s invasion has sparked widespread allegations of war crimes, as hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed and numerous residential areas have been targeted by Russian troops. ____ The Kremlin says that President Vladimir Putin has discussed the situation in Ukraine with European Council President Charles Michel. The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin informed Michel about the Russian view of the talks with Ukraine in Tuesday’s call, adding that Ukrainian officials haven’t yet “demonstrated a serious intention to search for mutually acceptable solutions.” Michel said on Twitter that he told Putin about the “urgent need to stop Russia’s fratricidal war against Ukraine” and emphasized that “indiscriminate shelling by Russian forces of Ukraine civilians must stop.” He added that “Russia must urgently enable humanitarian access and safe passage. ___ WARSAW — During a news conference with foreign journalists on Monday in Warsaw, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said that while solidarity for Ukrainian refugees remains strong, steps must be taken to avoid a backlash. More than 1.8 million refugees have fled to Poland. Around 390,000 people have traveled to Warsaw, where 300,000 displaced Ukrainians remain. Warsaw has become a major transfer point for Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion. Its central train station has become a hub for people awaiting transport further West. “I need to take care of the normal functioning of the city, because the more problems we have, the more our attention is diverted to other issues for longer, then we will start having problems in schools and hospitals and elsewhere,” he told reporters. ___ BELGRADE, Serbia — Another flight from Belgrade to Moscow has received a bomb threat that turned out to be false, Serbia’s police said Tuesday. Unlike two other threats since Friday, this time it came before the plane took off. On Friday and Monday, the aircraft had to turn back shortly after takeoff for inspection. The police said Tuesday they are investigating the third false claim in five days. Serbian state media say the threatening emails came from Ukraine. Besides Turkish carriers, Serbia’s national airline AirSerbia is the only airline in Europe still flying to and from Russia. Serbia, which formally seeks European Union membership but has maintained close relations with ally Russia, has refused to join an international flight ban against Moscow in response to the war in Ukraine. ___ UNITED NATIONS — Russia has circulated a proposed U.N. Security Council resolution demanding protection for civilians “in vulnerable situations” in Ukraine and safe passage for humanitarian aid and people seeking to leave the country — but it makes no mention of Russia’s responsibility for the war against its smaller neighbor. The draft resolution released Tuesday expresses “grave concern” at the deteriorating humanitarian situation and reports of civilian casualties in and around Ukraine. It endorses U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ call for dialogue and negotiations and calls for a negotiated cease-fire to rapidly evacuate “all civilians,” and underscores “the need for the parties concerned to agree on humanitarian pauses to this end.” The draft, which never identifies “the parties concerned,” could be put to a vote as early as Wednesday, according to a Russian diplomat who was not authorized to speak publicly because discussions have been private. The Russian measure was circulated a day after France and Mexico announced that a humanitarian resolution on Ukraine they co-sponsored, which had been discussed for two weeks in the Security Council, was being moved to the 193-member General Assembly for discussion and a vote. That draft resolution called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and deplored the dire humanitarian consequences of the hostilities in Ukraine, provisions which are not in the proposed Russian resolution. The France-Mexico resolution would almost certainly have led to a Russian veto in the Security Council, but there are no vetoes in the General Assembly. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters that his country is prepared to support a humanitarian resolution and after Monday’s announcement by the French and Mexican ambassadors Russia thinks “the chances are still there,” so he was putting forward its “roadmap” and will see whether the council adopts it. ___ Associated Press Writer Edith Lederer contributed to this report. ___ TORONTO — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Canadians to imagine bombs landing in their communities as he told the Canadian Parliament that his people want to live. Zelenskyy urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canadian lawmakers to help enact a no-fly zone over the Ukraine and called for greater economic pressure on Russia. “Justin, can you imagine you and your children hearing all these severe explosions, the bombing of the airport, the bombing of the Ottawa airport,” Zelenskyy said. “Cruise missiles are falling down and your children are asking you, ‘What happened?’” Speaking by video from Ukraine to a packed Canadian House of Commons chamber, Zelenskyy said the Russian war is designed to annihilate Ukraine and subjugate its people. Zelenskyy evoked British wartime leader Winston Churchill as he told the U.K. Parliament last week that his country would fight Russia’s invasion to the end. Zelenskyy will also speak Wednesday to members of the U.S. House and Senate, an event that will be livestreamed for the public. ___ MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — In Mykolaiv, a southern Ukraine city bordering the Black Sea, walls of sandbags with mannequins for decoys are placed at checkpoints. A high sandbag wall protects the front of a building serving as a support center for the military. Rodyin Lavrushin is a volunteer at the center. He lifted a tarp covering plastic crates filled with Molotov cocktails. “Here we collect everything from food to clothes and military specifics and help our military because the Russian occupiers came here to our home and we will protect it to the end.” Lavrushin said Monday. Mykolaiv resident Svetlana Gryshchenko said her son was killed Feb. 26 in the Donetsk region. “He went there to the military command,” Gryshchenko said. “He was a soldier and he’d just turned 24. He went there to work (with the military), not to fight.” “What is happening now in Mykolaiv cannot be described through words,” Gryshchenko said. “We are bombed during the day and during the night. We are peaceful citizens, and I cannot put it into words. It is impossible to put into words. It’s a nightmare what Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine.” Outside the Mykolaiv city morgue, bodies placed in plastic bags lie on the ground because the building had no room for more of the dead. ___ NEW YORK — Fox News says one of its video journalists was killed in Ukraine when the vehicle he was traveling in was struck by incoming fire. The network said Tuesday that videographer Pierre Zakrzewski was killed in an incident that also injured reporter Benjamin Hall, who remains hospitalized. Their injuries occurred Monday in Horenka, outside of Kyiv. Zakrzewski was a veteran journalists who had covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria for Fox. Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo to staff members on Tuesday that “his passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.” He won an internal award at Fox for helping to get freelancers and their families out of Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal last year. He was the second journalist killed in Ukraine in two days, following the death of documentary filmmaker Brent Renaud. ___ BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the 30-nation military alliance is set to radically change its security posture in Europe in the future in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its military integration with Belarus, create a new security reality on the European continent,” Stoltenberg said Tuesday, on the eve of a meeting of NATO defense ministers. “We need to reset our military posture for this new reality,” he told reporters. Stoltenberg said the ministers, led by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, would discuss possible changes on Wednesday. “On land, this could include substantially more forces in the eastern part of the alliance, at higher readiness, and with more prepositioned equipment,” Stoltenberg said. In recent years, NATO has deployed a relatively small force of around 5,000 troops to the Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – and Poland on a rotating basis to deter Russia from invading. Stoltenberg says he expects the ministers will task NATO military commanders to come up with options for boosting security in eastern Europe for the alliance’s leaders to choose among at their June summit.",World/Associated Press,"Live updates: Ukraine, Russia to continue talks Wednesday",https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-russian-strikes-hit-060359899.html
