3/2/2022,"Russia may be planning aggressive moves against the Republic of Moldova, according to a map Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko displayed during a meeting of his country's security council. Lukashenko is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He seemingly allowed Putin to use Belarus as a staging ground for his invasion of Ukraine and is reportedly planning to commit his own country's troops to the conflict. The map, which Financial Times Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon shared on Twitter, shows Ukraine split into its four operational command districts and features red arrows that appear to indicate planned troop movements. One of those arrows originates in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa, which Russian troops have not yet reached, and terminates on the other side of the Moldovan border. Lukashenko, addressing his security council, points to a map of Ukraine that shows what look like planned troop movements, infrastructure targets, and the country divided into four parts pic.twitter.com/O81hpIvZM3 â€” max seddon (@maxseddon) March 1, 2022 In January, Ukrainian intelligence warned that Russia could initiate false flag operations in Moldova to justify intervening in the pro-Russian separatist-controlled region of Transnistria, according to Al Jazeera. Transnistria, a narrow strip of land with around 400,000 inhabitants, is internationally recognized as part of Moldova, but the Moldovan government has exercised no authority over the breakaway republic since 1992. Russian troops have been stationed in Transnistria ever since. In 2014, after Putin seized control of Crimea, the head of Transnistria's parliament requested to join Russia, BBC reported at the time.

3/2/2022,"Several demoralized Russian troops captured in Ukraine were allowed to call home over the weekend to tell their families they were safe and profess confusion about why they were sent to war. ""Mama and Papa, I didn't want to come here. They forced me to,"" a Russian soldier said in videos purporting to show the phone calls that were taken by Ukraine's Interior Ministry and posted on YouTube. Videos and stills of captured or surrendered Russian troops also were posted on the Ukrainian Security Service's Facebook page. The posting of the videos showing captured Russian troops raised questions about whether Ukraine had violated Article 13 of the Geneva Conventions, calling for the protection of prisoners of war ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.""

""It's a violation"" of Geneva to post the videos, but not what would be considered a ""grave breach"" to be taken up by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Solis said. ""Anybody who is captured is a prisoner of war"" and must be shielded from abuse and provided medical treatment as a lawful combatant, he added. ""Clearly, the Russians who were captured were wearing uniforms."" He compared what the Ukrainians had done more to a misdemeanor than a felony, and also noted that there was a positive humanitarian aspect of the videos in showing ""proof of life"" to the families of the captured troops. The International Criminal Court in The Hague has made no mention of Ukrainian actions since Russia invaded last week, but on Monday, ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said in a press release that he planned to begin an investigation ""as rapidly as possible"" into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russia tied to the bombing and shelling of civilian buildings. In English subtitles added to one video by Ukrainian authorities, another Russian soldier tried to explain his plight to his mother: ""Hello, hello, Mom? Hi, did you recognize me? I am in the territory of Ukraine. I've been taken captive but I'm alright."" In addition to the videos of soldiers calling home, the Interior Ministry showed off-camera interrogators questioning the troops who mostly appeared to be unharmed and speaking freely, but some had cuts and bruises on their faces. One soldier appeared under sheets in what was either an aid station or hospital bed and said ""I got here not knowing"" what the mission was, according to the Ukrainian translation. ""I didn't imagine what will happen here. There was no need to come here."" He said ""our convoy got under fire"" and now ""my legs are broken."" He had a wife and two children back in Russia, the soldier said, and ""I pray to God to recover."" A common theme among the soldiers was that they were conscripts, with little concept of why they were sent into Ukraine and-or what their mission was once they crossed the border. One Russian soldier said: ""We came here under the pretext of doing military exercises. We were not planning to make war on Ukraine. I am alive and healthy as a captive, and my message is to stop the war in Ukraine. It is nonsense; people are dying."" Ukrainian officials gave no overall figure for how many Russian troops may have been captured, but Ukraine's Interior Ministry reported Tuesday that 5,710 Russian troops had been killed since the Feb. 24 invasion began. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov declined Sunday to give numbers on how many Russian troops had been killed or captured but said more Ukrainians than Russians had been killed, Russia's Tass news agency reported. ""There are dead and wounded among our comrades,"" Konashenkov said without giving any figures, but added that Ukraine's losses were ""many times"" more than Russia's -- again without giving specifics. Although they may not be wearing uniforms, the civilians would be considered lawful combatants so long as they were wearing a sign or symbol of their allegiance, and simply carrying a weapon would qualify as such a sign, Solis said.

3/2/2022,"Some Russian troops are intentionally punching holes in their gas tanks, a Pentagon official said, per The New York Times. The official said that many of the Russian troops are young and inexperienced, per the Times. Some Russian troops are surrendering to Ukrainian forces as morale drops, Insider previously reported. Some Russian troops have ""deliberately punched holes in their vehicles' gas tanks"" as morale among the Russians declines, a senior US official said. The troops appear to be self-sabotaging in order to avoid combat, the unnamed senior Pentagon official said, per The New York Times. The official added that many of the Russian troops are young and inexperienced in combat, and they are facing dwindling food and fuel resources. Tuesday marks day six of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, prompting protests across the world, including in Russia. Explosions have rocked the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, as well as Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv, since Russia invaded the region. As morale drops, some of the Russian troops have surrendered to Ukrainian forces ""without a fight,"" a US senior defense official told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday. The US official said that there has been evidence ""of a certain risk averse behavior by the Russian military,"" since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine, CNN reported. In response to Russia's assault, western nations have since levied heavy sanctions and other restrictive financial measures against the country, a move that Putin claimed was unlawful.

While Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Sasha Baker also said the U.S. was ""comfortable with our strategic defensive posture"", she turned to Adm. Richard to respond as well. He added that part of the reason he was testifying remotely from USSTRATCOM headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, was so he could ""assess and be satisfied in terms of our defensive posture.""",Politics/Reuters Videos,Top nuclear official 'satisfied' with U.S. forces in face of Putin's threat,https://news.yahoo.com/top-nuclear-official-satisfied-u-222726249.html
