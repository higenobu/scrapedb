1/15/2022,"A Capitol riot suspect stormed out of a virtual detention hearing on Wednesday. Prosecutors say Tim Boughner sprayed chemical irritants at police outside of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Boughner said he wanted to ""go eat my food and play cards"" before exiting the call. A Michigan man accused of spraying police with chemical irritants and using a metal bike rack to push back against officers during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot stormed out of his virtual detention hearing on Wednesday after being denied pretrial release, according to Law and Crime. Tim Boughner, 41, has been in federal custody since December and at a detention hearing on Wednesday, Judge Zia M. Faruqui said that he did not plan to grant Boughner's request for pretrial release. According to Law and Crime, the judge made the decision in part because of Boughner's mother, who said she wouldn't be able to ensure Boughner wouldn't try to flee. ""This is in fact one of the few cases where I believe the risk of flight is a real concern,"" the judge said, adding that he was worried Boughner might desert to Canada if released. When Faruqui further explained his reasoning for denying pretrial release, Boughner verbally fought back, saying ""You really don't know what happened. You guys gonna believe what you guys wanna believe. So hey, it is what it is."" Despite the judge saying that Boughner could appeal the decision, the defendant lashed out at Faruqui. ""You know what, I don't care anymore, I'm done with this,"" Boughner said before leaving the hearing. ""So I'd like to go eat my food and play cards."" According to Law and Crime, Boughner's lawyer, James McHugh, then asked Faruqui for a moment aside with his client in a ""virtual breakout room."" While McHugh rejoined the hearing shortly after, Boughner did not, waiving his right to appear at the hearing. Following his client's desertion, Faruqui continued to explain his reasoning for denying the request for pretrial release. He said that fighting against the police had the ""effect of a general rallying the troops around him and convincing them to continue"" during the Capitol riots, further alleging Boughner had a ""de facto leadership role"" that day. The judge also said he was concerned that Boughner continues to believe that former President Donald Trump defeated President Joe Biden in 2020. He referenced a Facebook post from Boughner from February 2021 that read ""Biden's not the president."" Boughner's next hearing, a status conference, is scheduled for February 10, 2022.

1/15/2022,"An Illinois judge who came under fire after overturning a man's sexual assault conviction has been removed from adjudicating criminal cases. Last year, Adams County Judge Robert Adrian found Drew Clinton, 18, guilty of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old. Mr Clinton faced a minimum of four years in prison, but this month Judge Adrian said the 148 days spent in jail by Clinton was ""plenty of punishment"". The judge has been assigned to civil cases, the Herald-Whig newspaper said. Judge Adrian's reversal during a January sentencing hearing drew immediate backlash from advocates for sexual assault survivors and the 16-year-old girl who reported the assault. ""He made me seem like I fought for nothing and that I put my word out there for no reason,"" the girl told local station WGEM-TV. ""I immediately had to leave the courtroom and go to the bathroom. I was crying."" The teenager reported Mr Clinton sexually assaulted her after she became intoxicated at a party on 30 May, according to court documents. At trial, she testified she was unconscious and awoke to a pillow covering her face and Mr Clinton assaulting her. On 15 October, Mr Clinton was found guilty on one of three counts, of digitally penetrating the 16-year-old without consent. The charge carried a mandatory minimum sentence of four years. But in January of this year, Judge Adrian said the minimum sentence was ""not just"". ""There is no way for what happened in this case that this teenager should go to the Department of Corrections,"" he said, according to court transcripts posted online by local media. ""I will not do that."" He said the court would ""find that the People failed to prove their case"" on the one charge, and reversed the guilty verdict to not guilty. The judge noted Mr Clinton had only recently turned 18 prior to the incident and had no prior criminal record, and he also criticised the parents who provided alcohol to those at the party. ""This is what happens, he said, ""when we have people, adults, having parties for teenagers, and they allow co-eds and female people to swim in their underwear in their swimming pool"". The Quincy Area Network Against Domestic Abuse, which supports victims and survivors of domestic and sexual violence called Judge Adrian's reversal ""sends a chilling message to other rape victims"". ""One message is clear: If you are raped, avoid Judge Adrian's courtroom."" On Thursday, an administrative order filed by the chief judge of the Eighth Judicial Circuit reassigned him to small claims, probate dockets and other civil matters effective immediately.",U.S./BBC,US judge reassigned after reversing sex assault conviction,https://news.yahoo.com/us-judge-reassigned-reversing-sex-162039981.html
1/15/2022,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland has no plans at present to join NATO, its foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said on Friday, amid heightened security tensions between Finland's giant neighbour Russia and Ukraine. ""Finland does not discuss with NATO joining it, nor does Finland have such a project upcoming ... Finland's security policy remains unchanged,"" Haavisto told reporters at a teleconference following a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in France. Commenting on the Polish foreign minister's https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europe-greatest-risk-war-30-years-poland-warns-2022-01-13 warning of Europe being nearer war than it has been in 30 years, Haavisto said he understands the pressure Ukraine and Poland are under due to built-up security tensions on their borders. ""But I hope we are not in that kind of a situation,"" Haavisto said. Finnish and Swedish interest towards a NATO membership became a topic of international debate this week as Russian and U.S. officials held security policy talks in Geneva. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken hinted in an interview with MSNBC https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/secretary-of-state-u-s-is-prepared-if-russia-does-not-choose-diplomacy-dialogue-130778181839 that Finland wanted to join NATO after Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had told reporters on Wednesday that Russia would view Finland joining NATO as ""an instrument of confrontation"". Finland, which shares a difficult history with Russia after the two clashed during World War Two, has long maintained the door to NATO open, saying it has the right to apply for membership if it so chooses. Finland has cooperated with NATO since 1994 and joined its enhanced opportunities partnership in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea. Last month, Finland chose the NATO-compatible F-35 for its new fighter jet.

1/15/2022,"Three women were charged with assault and were accused of attacking Delta employees. Court documents allege the women were told they were too drunk to board a flight to Puerto Rico. If convicted, the three women face up to 10 years in prison. Three women have been charged with assault in an incident in which they're accused of attacking Delta employees who told them they couldn't board a flight from New York to Puerto Rico because they were too drunk, according to court documents reviewed by Insider. Long Island residents Jordan Nixon, Janessa Torres, and Johara Zavala were arrested on Thursday in connection to a September 22 incident at John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to a press release from the US Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York. In the letter to a judge, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace said that the women's flight from New York to San Juan, Puerto Rico, was delayed nearly five hours on September 22, and surveillance videos and bar receipts show they ordered around nine alcoholic drinks while they waited for their flight. Peace said in the letter that when the women got to their gate, Delta employees determined they should be denied access to their flight because ""they were acting belligerent, one of the defendants was refusing to wear her mask properly, and Zavala was visibly disoriented and possibly intoxicated."" The flight crew was notified of the intoxication, and a member of the crew and the captain stepped off the plane to observe the women, before determining that they were too drunk to board, Peace wrote. Delta offered the women an opportunity to rebook the flight later in the day, Peace added. Peace said that the women were then asked to leave the area, and an altercation ensued, during which Nixon is accused of taking a Delta ground security officer's radio and hitting him on the head with it, Torres is accused of stepping on the same security officer, and Zavala is accused of punching a Delta gate agent in the face. According to Peace's letter, flight crews were able to pull one of the employees behind a glass door, but the ""three defendants continued to scream and strike at the Flight crew as they attempted to hold the doors closed."" The security officer and gate agent were taken to the hospital and have not returned to work since the alleged attack, Peace said in the letter to the judge. ""The extreme and aggressive behavior in connection with our air travel is out of control,"" Peace said in a statement. ""This Office has zero tolerance for violent conduct that threatens the safety of airline passengers and employees and will prosecute defendants who allegedly engage in such conduct to the fullest extent of the law."" Delta did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Peace requested on Thursday that the bail for each defendant be set at $50,000 ahead of their arraignments. If convicted, the three women face up to 10 years in prison. Airline workers union representatives have been outspoken about their concerns with pre-flight drinking, calling on terminal operators to implement more strict policies around the sale and consumption of alcohol in airports. The Federal Aviation Administration said it logged more than 6,000 incidents of unruly passengers in 2021, though most of those did not lead to criminal charges. Recent indictments or unruly passengers reflect the Justice Department's elevated priority of aviation-related crimes following Attorney General Merrick Garland instructions to federal prosecutors back in November. Before Garland's announcement, the department could spend a year or longer preparing to charge a suspect in an unruly passenger incident.
