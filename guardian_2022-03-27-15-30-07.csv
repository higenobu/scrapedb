3/27/2022,"A pot made in lockdown by the British artist Grayson Perry is unveiled this week, as it takes its place as an exhibit in the Science Museum in London. The large decorated vase will stand next to other symbolic items that illustrate the historic impact of the pandemic, including a selection of the vials used in the first mass Covid-19 vaccinations, some of the signs used in the government’s daily public pandemic briefings and a few examples of early homemade face coverings. On 30 March, the Turner prize-winning artist’s ceramic vase, titled Alan Measles – God in the time of Covid-19, joins the display in the museum’s Medicine: the Wellcome galleries. Inspired by the design of the “albarello” jars once used to hold drugs in hospital pharmacies, it is decorated in a simple, pale colour palette taken from the style of medieval “doom paintings”. And featured particularly prominently, among the images of many of the things that became familiar as infection rates spiralled, is Grayson’s famous teddy bear, Alan Measles. The bear appears alongside Perry’s female alter ego, Claire. Last but not least is the likeness of Chris Whitty, the UK’s chief medical adviser. Perry’s artwork began life during the hit Channel 4 television show Grayson’s Art Club, which aired during the first Covid-19 lockdown two years ago, and it has not been seen in its finished form until now. “This work reflects my state of mind during a time of great fear and uncertainty,” Perry said. “Alan Measles – my personal metaphor for God, masculinity, care and security – is shown distraught because his other half is seriously ill. His efforts helping at the hospital are mocked by protesters. “Depressed and exhausted, he joins a group of homeless people beneath a motorway.” The pot was created in the “fantasy” themed week of the C4 series presented by Perry and his wife, Philippa, also the Observer advice columnist, from their own home. “Perry’s moving and beautiful artwork” has been acquired for the gallery, said Natasha McEnroe, keeper of medicine at the Kensington museum, to help “represent not only advances in diagnosis and protection against Covid-19, but … the emotional impact of living through a public health crisis.” The smaller, unassuming vials going on display in the show were donated by the NHS and used on 8 December 2020 at the Coventry hospital where the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was given for the first time as part of the mass immunisation programme.",Arts/Art and design,"Grayson Perry, God, and a teddy named Measles sum up UK life in the Covid era ",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/27/grayson-perry-covid-science-museum-london
3/27/2022,"The federal executive of the Liberal party has staged another dramatic intervention in the troubled NSW branch and will take over all remaining contested preselections in New South Wales. With the prime minister, Scott Morrison, expected to soon call the election, the three branch plebiscites scheduled for this week will be abandoned. The Liberal federal executive voted Sunday morning to appoint a three-person committee – comprised of Morrison, NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and the former federal president of the party Chris McDiven – to take over the NSW division until next Saturday. The committee has been empowered to appoint candidates in the potentially winnable seats of Warringah, Hughes, Parramatta and Eden-Monaro and Greenway. It will also appoint candidates in seats the Liberals have little chance of winning, including Grayndler (held by the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese), Fowler (being contested by immigration spokesperson, Kristina Keneally), Newcastle and McMahon. The move, which has infuriated some of the party faithful, means the prime minister will have a big say in the remaining candidates and put his stamp on the make up of the parliamentary party in NSW. But it is likely to lead to further litigation by disgruntled Liberal party members and potentially more byelections for Perrottet, with up to two state MPs angling to move to Canberra. The NSW transport minister, David Elliott, is said to have re-ignited his interest in moving to federal politics and contesting either Parramatta or Greenway – both held by Labor but seen as winnable for the Liberals. Despite not having nominated, Elliott is a prominent member of the prime minister’s centre right faction and could now be springboarded into a federal seat. His political reputation has suffered a blow in recent weeks over his handling of industrial tensions with the Rail, Tram and Bus Union in NSW. “The minister won’t be commenting,” a spokesperson said on Sunday. The state MP for Holsworthy, Melanie Gibbons, has nominated for Hughes, currently held by former Liberal Craig Kelly by a margin of 9.9%. But there was talk on Sunday that the prime minister was pushing for Gwen Cherne, a war veteran family advocate, to run instead of local lawyer Jenny Ware, who has the backing of the moderates. Jerry Nockles, a former ministerial staffer who now works for the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, appears most likely to be appointed to Eden-Monaro. The federal intervention comes despite branch meetings and votes being scheduled in Parramatta on Monday, Hughes on Thursday and Eden-Monaro on Saturday. “It’s disgusting,” said one member, who is not authorised to speak to the media. “It’s as if the members just don’t matter.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The NSW Liberal party’s problems with appointing candidates have been brought about by a change in the party’s constitution in 2018, via the “Warringah motion”, which introduced a much greater say for ordinary branch members in choosing candidates. The rules only recently came into force and this is the first major election where they have been tested. This has led to factional manoeuvring in a bid to avoid plebiscites, which now appears to have succeeded. The immigration minister and centre right factional player, Alex Hawke, who is widely blamed for delaying the branch selections, was booed by the 500 party members who attended state council this weekend. An earlier court case, brought by NSW state executive member Matthew Camenzuli seeking to void an earlier action by the federal executive to reappoint three sitting MPs, is scheduled for a hearing in the NSW supreme court on Thursday. It could be expedited and expanded to cover the latest intervention by the federal executive. A messy court case would be an unwelcome distraction for the party at the start of the federal election campaign. Further byelections for state seats vacated by Liberal MPs swapping to federal politics would put Perrottet under pressure. Elliott’s state seat of Baulkham Hills is one of the safest and would be unlikely to change hands in a byelection, but Holsworthy is marginal. Perrottet is already facing governing in minority with the suspension last week of the Liberal MP for Kiama, Gareth Ward, who has been charged over allegations of sexual abuse against a man and a 17-year-old boy. Ward denies the allegations. The most likely candidate for the northern beaches seat of Warringah, now held by independent Zali Steggall, is disability campaigner David Brady. But the Liberals believe they have little chance of regaining the seat this time around. Over the weekend the NSW division held a selection for the Senate. Marise Payne secured the first spot on the ticket, while Senator Jim Molan secured the third spot, edging out Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells.",News/Australia news,Liberal federal executive intervenes to halt NSW preselections and take over state division,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/27/liberal-federal-executive-intervenes-to-halt-nsw-preselections-and-take-over-state-division
3/27/2022,"No amount of propaganda or fake news can disguise the fact that President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s invaders are in deep trouble in Ukraine. The problem is partly military. Moscow’s forces have failed to secure major cities, including the capital, Kyiv. They have suffered tens of thousands of casualties – including 16,000 dead, according to Ukraine – and lost hundreds of tanks, planes and armoured vehicles. Bad planning, poor logistics, incompetent leadership and rock-bottom morale, sparking reported mutinies, have undermined their entire operation. Yet Putin’s problem is also political and ideological. Russia has almost zero international support. And in an extraordinary intervention that is certain to infuriate and antagonise the Kremlin, US president Joe Biden said in Poland on Saturday: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” At home, too, Putin faces mounting criticism. Russia’s people and army do not seem to have any clear idea what grand cause supposedly justifies their sacrifices in Ukraine. Not so Ukrainians, both soldiers and civilians, whose courageous, highly effective defence of their homeland has held the world spellbound and paralysed Putin’s war machine. They have no doubt of what they are fighting for: for their children, for their future as a sovereign nation, for democracy. It is no exaggeration to say, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukraine is fighting for Europe and the world against the reactionary forces of autocracy and authoritarianism, a central theme of President Joe Biden’s Warsaw speech. The latest Moscow defence ministry statement saying that Russia will henceforth “focus our core efforts” on achieving “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas”, while disingenuous, may nevertheless be seen as an admission that Russia has failed in its wider aims, as vaguely set out by Putin, of “denazifying” and “demilitarising” all of Ukraine and forcing regime change on Kyiv. It may be this statement is another lie. It may be that Russia’s commanders are trying to regroup. But it does give cause for cautious optimism. Sensing weakness, Zelenskiy has been quick to renew his call for unconditional peace talks. He is right to do so. If it ever gets its act together, Russia’s military remains a formidable if wounded beast. It has reserves of men and weaponry that Ukraine can only dream of. If the battlefield stalemate continues and its humiliation deepens, Russia also has chemical and biological weapons. Fears that Putin may resort to such extremes produced a stern warning from Biden last week of an unspecified, consequential Nato response. An immediate ceasefire, followed by talks that do not seek to make Ukraine’s territorial integrity the price of peace, must be the aim. Neither side lacks incentives. The suffering of Ukraine’s people is dreadful. About a quarter of the population is displaced. Millions have fled abroad. The prospect of more war crimes and massacres, such as that in Mariupol, where up to 300 women and children reportedly died in a theatre bombing, is unsupportable. Putin needs to stop, too, if only to prevent permanent damage to Russia’s economy, its global standing and his hold on power. Does he see this? Who knows? At this fragile juncture, the clear responsibility of the western democracies, working through Nato and the EU, is to step up pressure on the Kremlin to stop the war – not in any way to ease off. Unfortunately, there are signs the latter may be happening. Influenced by France and Germany, last week’s EU summit failed to impose significant new sanctions. Russia’s hugely lucrative EU oil and gas exports are largely unaffected so far. Calls by the Baltic republics for a ban on Russian road freight and shipping were ignored. And Ukraine’s EU membership hopes were dashed anew. A parallel Nato summit also saw too much self-congratulation and too little self-examination. Despite Biden’s talk of unprecedented alliance unity, there are clear divisions. Poland and other east European members have pressed in vain for a more robust military approach, for example by supplying MiG-29 fighter planes. Boris Johnson’s idea of sending tanks was reportedly quashed by President Emmanuel Macron. Promised weaponry from France and Germany has not arrived. Speaking via video link, Zelenskiy bitterly complained that the more sophisticated armaments Ukraine needs are not forthcoming and personally challenged leaders who he said were dragging their feet. It may be that Putin is becoming more realistic. Or that, observing intra-European tensions, he is playing for time. It’s possible that, in any negotiation, he would settle for the territorial gains he has made in the Donbas region while trying to hang on to a southern “land bridge” to Crimea. It’s possible, too, that some European countries might favour such a deal and even offer to lift sanctions, if it stopped the war, the refugee exodus and the economic damage it is causing them. Such concessions would be difficult, even impossible, for many Ukrainians to accept and they should not be pushed into making them. Ukraine must ultimately decide how and when this ends. Meanwhile, this is not the moment to ease western pressure on a flailing Russia and its war criminal president.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on why Europe’s pressure on Putin must redouble | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/27/observer-view-europe-must-redouble-pressure-on-putin-ukraine
3/27/2022,"Russian artists and performers must not stay silent about the war, according to one of the world’s leading ballet choreographers, Alexei Ratmansky. The Russian-born former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, who left a new production in Moscow on news of the invasion, was responding to Mikhail Baryshnikov’s call not to punish cultural and sporting figures for failing to stand up to Vladimir Putin’s regime. Speaking to the Observer on 20 March , Baryshnikov, the actor and ballet star, launched a fundraising drive to support Ukraine. But he also said Russian stars who do not speak out should not be targeted by the west. In contrast, Ratmansky, an admirer and friend of Baryshnikov, believes there is no excuse for not actively opposing the war. Posting on Facebook, the choreographer said he found it “hard to agree with Misha”. He pointed out that in 2014 more than 500 well-known Russian figures in the arts, including major ballet personalities, signed a letter of support for Putin’s annexation of Crimea. “After this letter,” Ratmansky wrote, “every performance or any public action of these 500 could be seen as an act of propaganda. Especially those who have gone on to perform in the west. These people have made a strong political statement supporting their president’s unlawful actions. They are playing politics and therefore should be held responsible or at least asked serious questions. “It is precisely because of the support of the most visible figures of Russian culture that Putin gained his unlimited power and now is using it against humanity in this bloody war that is destroying Ukraine.” The choreographer, who grew up in Ukraine and has family in Kyiv, said there were dancers in Moscow who must realise that Russia is bombing cities and so should be held to account. Ratmansky added: “It’s humiliating to think that dancers should only dance and concentrate on their art, ignoring what’s going on around them. It’s not only pretty legs they possess, they also have brains and hearts. “The mass murder of innocent people in Ukraine is done in their name also, in the name of Great Russia of Culture that was so admired by the whole world until very recently.” Ratmanksy, who has a new job with the American Ballet Theater, premiered his ballet The Seasons in San Francisco this month and unfurled a Ukrainian flag over the stage. He is now in Munich preparing another opening night. Putin spoke out on Friday against the “cancellation” of Russian stars in Europe, making an unlikely comparison with criticism of the writer JK Rowling from some trans rights campaigners. “Today they are trying to cancel a whole thousand-year culture, our people,” he said. “I am talking about the gradual discrimination against everything linked to Russia.” Nevertheless, a growing number of cultural names in Russia are expressing disgust at the war. Among the best known is Olga Smirnova, a principal soloist at the Bolshoi, who announced 10 days ago she has joined the Dutch National Ballet because of the war in Ukraine. This weekend the Russian news agency Tass reported that Putin has asked the leading conductor and Kremlin loyalist Valery Gergiev to consider taking over artistic control at both the Bolshoi and its St Petersburg rival, the Mariinsky Ballet, formerly the Kirov. Gergiev, who lost prestigious work in Europe due to his support for Putin, reportedly said it would be a good idea “to coordinate efforts” at the two theatre companies. But it is not just artistic talent that may be temporarily lost to Russia. Valuable Russian works of art now on show in museums around Europe cannot be sent back to Moscow and St Petersburg because of bans imposed on international flights. The priceless Morozov collection of European and Russian art left Russia to go on show in Paris only after the personal approval of Putin, reports the Moscow Times. The works, which include masterpieces by Gauguin, Renoir and Cézanne, and Russian paintings by Malevich and Goncharova, belong to the State Hermitage in St Petersburg, the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts and the State Tretyakov Gallery. The whole collection was scheduled to open at the Pushkin museum this summer.",Arts/Stage,Alexei Ratmansky: Russian cultural figures must oppose war in Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/27/alexei-ratmansky-russian-cultural-figures-must-oppose-war-in-ukraine
3/27/2022,"When Nan Goldin’s The Ballad of Sexual Dependency first appeared in the 1980s – around 700 intimate photographic slides, shown in galleries, set to music – it established a new raw standard of self-revelation, in which nothing was off-limits. In it, Goldin documented her own life in the previous decade, the years between punk and Aids, in which she lived as a teenage dropout among New York’s drag queens, when the druggy parties in her loft in the Bowery district never ended. She made the flash-lit slides originally to entertain the friends she photographed. She described The Ballad as “the diary I let people read”. This picture, Nan and Brian in Bed, became one of the defining images of the series. It shows Goldin looking with narrowed eyes at her lover, an office worker and ex-marine, whom she had met while working in a bar on Tin Pan Alley. She views him naked as a voyeur, subverting the normal dynamics of the male gaze. The pair of them were consumed, The Ballad shows, by heroin and lust and, eventually, violence. On a trip to Berlin in 1984, Brian burned Goldin’s journals and beat her so badly that she nearly lost an eye. “Confronting my normal ambivalence had betrayed his absolute notion of romance,” she said. The disturbing post-coital tension here prefigures her harrowing self-portrait at the centre of the series: Nan one month after being battered. Goldin’s work is the inspiration for a new exhibition in Paris, Love Songs, which collects images that confront the compulsive and destructive power of intimacy. Few of those pictures have quite the directness as her original Ballad, however, which has been constantly revised and re-edited by Goldin in the years since, the signature record of a long lost time and place. “I didn’t care about ‘good’ photography,” she famously said. “I cared about complete honesty.” Love Songs: Photography and Intimacy is at MEP, Paris, from 30 March–21 August",Arts/Art and design,The big picture: Nan Goldin explores the destructive power of intimacy​,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/27/the-big-picture-nan-goldin-explores-the-destructive-power-of-intimacy
3/27/2022,"John Richardson’s serial biography of Picasso stalled when Richardson died three years ago at the age of 95. After this hiatus it now resumes, but in a different mood. The first three volumes were triumphalist, emphasising Picasso’s victorious advance from Barcelona to Paris and the X-ray vision that enabled him to fracture reality and modernise the visual world. In the fourth volume, with Europe caving in to fascism and Spain convulsed by civil war, the surrealist Michel Leiris sets the agenda with a baleful warning. “Picasso,” Leiris announced in 1937, “sends us our letter of doom.” That declaration refers to Guernica, Picasso’s panorama of the bombed Basque town, where distraught civilians and gutted animals writhe under a radioactive monochrome sun while in the corner a villager’s emergency trip to empty her bowels in an outhouse exposes what Picasso called “the most primitive effect of fear”. The painting, Leiris added, predicts that “all that we love is going to die” and he recommended an affectionate farewell to the cultural beauty that was everywhere imperilled. Picasso, however, had more personal concerns: Richardson’s narrative emphasises physical beauty ravaged and love defamed or defiled, as the artist works his way through a series of women who are transfixed by his gaze, cruelly anatomised, then discarded once their metamorphic potential has been exhausted. “Picasso Picassofied people,” as Richardson says, and the Picassofying involved a kind of vivisection. The new volume begins with his assault on his jangled, cranky Russian wife, Olga, in portraits that Richardson calls “masterpieces of marital hatred”. Next comes Dora Maar, an obligingly masochistic candidate for visual abuse. In an act of priapic worship, Dora photographed Picasso on the beach in a pair of what would now be called budgie smugglers; repaying the compliment, he represented her “licking testicular scoops of ice cream with a pointed blue tongue”, like a serpent skilled at fellatio. Later, she became the abject, clingy subject of Picasso’s Weeping Woman, after which he shunted her ahead into premature decay by portraying her as a wrinkled hag. Cast off, she lapsed into neurotic despair, then finally sought consolation in Catholic mysticism. “After Picasso,” she said, “there is only God.” Richardson is inclined to agree with Dora, since Picasso’s compulsive, ruthless creativity was that of a deity or perhaps a demon. In earlier volumes, Richardson emphasised the black magic in his art; here, his “immense, albeit flawed power” is incarnated in the beefy body and spiked horns of the minotaur, the half-human, half-bull from Greek myth whose bellowing in an underground labyrinth was blamed for earthquakes. The minotaur demanded human sacrifices, but the taurine Picasso made do with a parade of self-sacrificing women and, as Richardson tracks his polyamorous frolics, the torments he visited on Olga and Dora give way to bedroom farce. In the course of one year-long retreat from Paris, he juggled six muses and mistresses, whom he distributed in separate menages around the same country town. Richardson’s third volume concluded that Picasso was “apolitical”: at best, he could be called a monarchist, if only because he awarded himself kingly prerogatives. Events after 1933 tested this ideological disengagement without ever destroying it. Dalí, a delirious fascist, thought that Picasso trained an “imaginative machine gun” on Franco, but can a brush qualify as a weapon? Despite reiterated appeals to join the fray in Spain, Picasso did not return; he applied for French citizenship to avoid extradition and even served in absentia as director of the Prado, from which all the paintings had in any case been removed. During the German occupation of Paris, he accepted the hospitality of quislings such as an Argentine diplomat who “embodied everything that he loathed” but kept him in cigarettes and lavishly lunched him on black-market delicacies served by liveried waiters. Having stowed his own canvases in a bank vault, Picasso flummoxed the soldiers who inspected the hoard by playing a financially clueless simpleton. His dealer, meanwhile, rejoiced in the scarcity of saleable new work, which kept prices high throughout the war. As Picasso nonchalantly confessed, his behaviour was not heroic: he stayed put in Paris out of mere inertia. More than that, he thought of self-preservation as his sacred duty. Despite his raffish bohemianism, he owned a sleek Hispano-Suiza limousine whose interior decor featured flower arrangements in crystal vases; a white-gloved chauffeur ferried him about, because he refused to take the wheel himself. “An artist,” he explained, “should never put his hands at risk.” Richardson challenged this embargo by pointing out to Picasso that he surely risked his hands when sculpting iron. Picasso scoffed at the notion: a welder took care of such manual chores for him. Anecdotes like this derive from the time Richardson spent as a member of Picasso’s matey entourage during the 1950s. He was then living in a French chateau with the moneyed connoisseur Douglas Cooper, who, as Richardson puts it with coy mock-modesty, collected “cubist works of art and good-looking young men”. Cooper and Richardson cooked for Picasso and his followers as they travelled home from the bullfights in Arles and he repaid this hospitality with gifts of drawings. Later, realising what his casual scribbles were worth, he gave them caviar instead, which he said was cheaper. The biography is enlivened by this anecdotal intimacy, though when I met Richardson in New York in 2008, he said: “I’m sure Picasso would have hated my books.” The infatuations Richardson documents were the sources for Picasso’s imagery and he wanted to keep that psychic reservoir secret. Richardson, however, has ingeniously deciphered the art without demystifying the artist. This posthumous volume is briefer than its predecessors and was evidently produced with difficulty: Richardson suffered from macular degeneration, which allowed him to see paintings but caused him trouble with print, and he needed help from collaborators whose actual contribution to the book is unclear. All the same, it’s sad that there won’t be a fifth instalment, or a sixth, to follow the subject into his fecund, defiant old age. After Picasso, Dora Maar at least had God; Richardson’s Picasso won’t be so easy to replace.  A Life of Picasso Volume IV: The Minotaur Years 1933-43 is published by Vintage (£35).

3/27/2022,"“Things to ask Kate”. I spot the scrap of paper with this heading, on the kitchen table. My 84-year-old mum is dishing up lunch, talking animatedly about “the bloody government doing bugger all” about Ukrainian refugees. “It is so awful,” I reply, picking up the envelope and handing it to her. “Are there some things you want help with, Mum?” “Oh yes,” she replies, standing up again. “Where have I put my glasses?” I glance at the cooker to check the rings are all off and pick up the newspaper cutting she handed me when I arrived that she wants me to read. “Do you know,” she says, “I was writing an email at 5am and all of a sudden it just vanished. Vanished.” She turns to look at me, opening her eyes and hands wide to signal the void it’s fallen into. “I’ll have a look and see if I can find it,” I say, wondering whether to ask if she checked the drafts folder. Falling into a void is perhaps my mother’s greatest fear. Forgetful and sometimes wandering, she finds the world increasingly confusing, the spectre of dementia hanging over her old age. “That bloody thing,” she complains frequently, pointing to her iPad, “it drives me mad.” Lost emails are often on the list, along with occurrences such as The Crown going back to the beginning and showing her episodes she’s already seen, and variations on what “two dashes and a dot with a wiggly thing above it” means. She often asks where she can buy such-and-such – the ubiquitousness of Amazon having escaped her – how to pay bills or give to a cause she’s read about. The answer is nearly always online. Online. Online. Online. Sometimes I show her, knowing she almost certainly won’t remember. Mostly I do it for her. The topsy-turvy nature of this mother-and-daughter dynamic was perhaps on my mind when I thought of a plan for dealing with a problem of my own – I needed new curtains for my front room. Could my mum, who had made all our curtains when I was growing up, but whose sight and steadiness of hand were not now reliable enough for her to make them herself, guide me through the steps so that, between us, we could make them together? The idea appealed to me, and not just as a way of making my front room more cosy. Would this project, I wondered, give our relationship an injection of vitality, a focus on creating something I could remember her by, as she was shortly to move 200 miles away to live opposite my sister? I put the idea to her thinking that, despite her struggle to remember the recent past and to take in new information, she would remember how to make curtains. Her response – “Oh, it’s easy, you just sew the sides together and then turn it inside out, like a pillow case. Then there’s the rufflette tape, but even that is straightforward, really” – gave me confidence. I’ve never been a seamstress, but knew my way around the charming old Frister & Rossmann sewing machine that had been her grandmother’s. I set about measuring the window space and looking at material. “They’ll be much nicer if you line them,” said Mum, when I’d confessed I wasn’t going to bother. Her sentiment percolated over the coming days, segueing into reassurance of her investment in the project – and I began to fall in love with the idea of my beautiful new velvet curtains, which would indeed deserve to be lined. “Don’t ask them to cut it, they won’t do it evenly,” she counselled, when it came to ordering the material. But I ignored her on this. With three widths of curtain material and the same again of lining for each curtain (12 widths in total, each 3m long), I didn’t trust my measuring and cutting skills – or our mutual patience – and asked for the material to be sent already cut. I was counting on her having forgotten her advice by the time the material arrived. She hadn’t! We laid the lining out on the bed in her spare room and began to pin; Mum picking out and handing me colour-top pins from her tin, one by one. Then we tacked, Mum painstakingly and often triumphantly threading a new needle in the time it took me to sew the previous length of thread. We lifted the material on to the table with the Frister & Rossmann at the ready and I began to sew, winding the handle with my right hand, Mum sitting opposite me, receiving and straightening the material as it fed through to the other side. By the end of our first session together one of the linings was ready. We were both elated. This really was going to work. The second lining went just as smoothly. Our third session, however, repeating these steps but with the velvet, wasn’t so straightforward, the top piece buckling. “It will be fine, you won’t notice,” said Mum, to my surprise – her more usual Eeyore tendency to believe the worst will happen having apparently dissolved. Enjoying her calm authority, I carried on, but by the time I got to the end, one piece was longer than the other. She continued to insist it wouldn’t matter. “When they’re hanging you won’t notice it in the folds. Honestly.” She was proving so sure-footed about the sequence of steps and what needed to happen at each stage, that I trusted her judgment – plus, I couldn’t face unpicking it all. Her reassurance was touching, too. Our roles, so often the other way round these days, had reverted back again. She was the expert, I the neophyte. Then the sewing machine, which hadn’t been used in decades, faltered, making large, loose stitches instead of small, tight ones. Our little operation at a standstill, Mum suggested handstitching the curtains – as she had done with hers – pointing out that this would allow more “give” with each stitch, avoiding the buckling. But I felt my energy drain away at the idea of all that handsewing, so I bought special oil for the bobbin and, when that didn’t work, sought out a specialist who serviced the machine and told me to change the needle. He also pointed out that it was ambitious for a novice like me to work with velvet. “The two surfaces move against each other,” he said. “It’s probably the hardest fabric to work with.” Eventually, we were back in business, the machine running smoothly again, and me handling the velvet more assertively as I fed it through. Meanwhile, arrangements for Mum’s move were hotting up with various workmen in her house preparing it to be let. Decorators were in the spare bedroom, so we relocated to the kitchen – but it was too dusty in there – and then to her bedroom, which was a squash. “I don’t think we’re going to get them finished in time,” said Mum, her anxiety about the upheaval all around her taking its toll. We’d sewn the curtain material to the lining, but the ends were very uneven – and for the first time Mum was stumped about what to do next. We needed to put the project away – again. Christmas came and went and by mid-January we were going again, Mum’s enthusiasm – and clarity – having returned, along with proof of just how competent and clear-thinking she was still capable of being. We cut the bottom to an even length and sewed on the rufflette tape. Now they were ready to hang, the final step – the hems – to be measured once up. Expectation at home was growing. We’d been without curtains since the previous spring and a cosy front room was longed for. My neighbour lent me her drill, my daughter’s boyfriend put up a rail, and my son drove the curtains from Mum’s house to ours. I put 20 hooks in each curtain, slotted them into the rail and stood back to admire our handiwork. Lush folds of gold velvet fell the length of the bay, shutting out the black winter night. It was wonderful. Mum hotfooted it round with her walking stick and with me up a ladder encouraged me on as I pulled the threads in the rufflette tape to get the tops to concertina. At various points the thread was caught in the stitching and I had to snip it free. Mum had warned me about this as I’d machined on the rufflette, but I’d been convinced she was worrying unnecessarily and ploughed on. I couldn’t help thinking of the 50s housewife card I’d given her on Mother’s Day last year: “It turns out everything my mother said was right!” We were all in tears when she moved a few weeks later but she’s now happily lapping up my sister and her husband’s care.

I had hoped that we would do boring things such as feed and house the entire population. Potholes would be fixed, public transport less expensive and unreliable houses insulated. Alas, the quest for shareholder value and bone-headed populism has instead produced a constant flow of unlearned lessons from our state institutions and an almost comical lack of self-awareness in the international arena. Ukraine, in her agony to achieve freedom from autocracy, has transformed a comedian into a statesman and leader and maintained a unity of purpose and nationhood. In contrast, the UK has become divided – between rich and poor, town and country, young and old and between the smaller nations of the union and England. Let’s embrace the boring and knuckle down to achieving concrete results, rather than promoting hype. Let us sit down and stop thinking that there are shortcuts to success at any level.Richard StylesWalmer, Kent Viv Groskop’s entertaining article on boring professions reminded me of the entry that used to appear in the Yellow Pages phone directory in the 1980s: “Boring – see Civil Engineers”.David HarperCambridge It was great to read your interview with Ruth Madeley about the drama Then Barbara Met Alan (“‘These stories change how people think’”, Magazine). While Ruth’s comments are excellent, she says: “I don’t think it had been done before: two visibly disabled characters, played by two disabled actors, in a loving – and sexy – sex scene.” However, this was done for the first time in the BBC film Every Time You Look at Me (2004), with Mat Fraser and Lisa Hammond. It was still astonishing that it took this long. My disabled partner, Richard Rieser, ran the “1 in 8 Campaign” in the 1990s, which broke new ground in campaigning for disabled people to be shown positively in all mainstream media, culminating in The Raspberry Ripple Awards on Channel 4.Susie BurrowsLondon N1 I read with mounting horror Stuart McGurk’s piece on the new-age fashion for “manifesting” what you want (“When your dreams come true”, Magazine). This turbo-charged individualism was a trend in the 1990s and it’s sad to see it being peddled again to desperate and gullible young people. Apparently to manifest a dream car or boyfriend you just need to totally focus on what you want. Presumably, people caught up in war and famine, poverty or violence are just not focusing enough?Marianne CraigBrighton Last week, this paper published its view on the Cass review on gender identity services for children, calling, without a hint of irony, for an end to “ideology” (“Children with gender identity issues are ill served by adults who shut down debate”, Comment). For years, the Gender Identity Development Service has been positioned as variably both “affirmative” or “gate-keeping”, “too rushed” or “too ponderous”. These are false dichotomies. At GIDS, we take a young person’s sense of themselves seriously. Some may refer to this approach as “affirmative”. However, being respectful of someone’s identity does not preclude exploration. Recent independent research relates first hand the experiences of young people. Most of our young people meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Yet only a minority access puberty blockers. Gender dysphoria alone is a poor predictor for who might benefit from a medical pathway. Our specialist NHS service works developmentally to arrive at a shared understanding of what support may be needed. While we are trained to identify wider psychological or safeguarding needs, we liaise with local services to meet these. We do explore and seek to understand the impact of co-occurring difficulties and neurodiversity, but do not conceptualise the experience of gender incongruence as a symptom to be resolved with extensive therapy. There is a reason GIDS evolved over decades at the Tavistock – it is a place with a long history of holding complexity. Simplistic notions about gender have no place and do not serve young people. Of course, what is universally accepted is the recognition that young people need more support from other services, something we have long been calling for.Paul Jenkins, CEO Tavistock and Polly Carmichael, director GIDS Thank you for your piece about the forced adoptions carried out in the 1950s-1970s (“‘We’re human beings, we deserve an apology,’ say forced adoption victims”, News). My mother was one of those who gave birth in a mother and baby home during that period and the experience scarred her for life. She was one of the few to keep her baby – in her “cohort” only two did so, herself and another young woman who was handing her child over to the grandma to raise. The impact on my mother was tremendous. She has suffered from mental health issues ever since, and when she gave birth to my brother 16 years later, the impact of that delayed trauma was still with her. She often spoke of the way she was chastised as she was giving birth to me, being told that she was an awful human being and that there was no way she would be able to raise a child out of wedlock. The impact was so extreme that when I was pregnant 40 years later, she had to have therapy due to PTSD flashbacks. The young women who had their children adopted were not the only ones who suffered. It was all young women who went through that system and the impact reverberates still among women of my age, both as daughters of those who kept their babies and daughters of those who were forced to submit, since that knowledge becomes a form of generational trauma that is handed down.Yasmin Stefanov-KingScarborough, North Yorkshire Snobbery and stereotyping in the Everyman crossword last Sunday?

3/27/2022," An article (Balancing the books on the backs of the poor, 13 March, p14) erred in saying the Trussell Trust “has consistently reported, for the last 10 years, that more than half the people referred to its food banks for emergency aid are there because they are in debt to the Department for Work and Pensions”. In fact the trust’s latest figures (for 2020) show 47% of referred users were in debt to the DWP, up from 26% in 2018, which was the first year this data was collected. The trust also says debts may combine with broader social security issues in driving these referrals.  The Labour MP Tulip Siddiq wrote that the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, accepted the UK’s debt to Iran was “legitimate” and acknowledged the link between that debt and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release; Siddiq did not write that Truss described the link itself as legitimate as we stated in a news article (Family’s MP says Johnson’s ‘very poor grasp’ of case led to errors, 20 March, p16).

3/27/2022,"Donald Trump’s ferocious money-raising machine, powered in equal measure by grassroots giving and large individual and corporate donations, has never really stopped turning – and it is currently raising huge sums of cash. As of this month, Trump has $123m saved in his Save America political fund, more than the Republican and Democratic national committees combined, and 12 times as much as the fund – Pac for the Future – for the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. And all of that has been raised while Trump’s own ambitions remain unclear. Though his grip on the Republican party remains tight – and he has waged an endorsement war against his opponents – the big question over whether Trump will run again for the White House remains unanswered. Without any declared candidacy, his war chest’s purpose and thus also that of its master, is unclear – and deliberately so. Trump cannot easily spend the money on himself should he decide to run in 2024. Save America is registered as a leadership pac, or political action committee, not a campaign tool himself for himself. Yet Trump is not yet spending much, according to its “leadership” purpose of supporting Republican candidates going into this year’s hotly contested midterm elections. Despite Trump’s more than 120 Republican endorsements, and even as Democrats pour money into the effort to retain control of Congress, the massive accumulation of cash under his control raises the question: what is it for? Trump has not stopped raising money since he left office, either through thousands of small donations raised at Trump rallies or online, or via the big donor money-machine that Democrats cannot match – being schmoozed by Trump himself on the golf course and in the dining room at Mar-a-Lago. Since Trump founded Save America in November 2020, the group has raised $124m – the largest war chest ever built by an ex-president – but spent only about $14m, or around 11%. In contrast, the main fund for supporting Senate Republican candidates has spent about 80% of the $135m it raised since the start of 2021, while its main fund for congressional candidates has spent half of the $162m it has raised in the same period. The question of Trump’s pac money is beginning to vex strategists on both sides of the political divide. It could be a fund designed to ensure the loyalty of Republican allies forming a new power base within the party, or he may have other designs – namely securing his own path forwards by securing the political future of loyalists. “It’s consistent with Trump’s political priorities – Trump first above everything else – and makes him well positioned for a presidential run in 2024,” said the Democratic consultant Carly Cooperman. “It’s possible he decides to make a big splash in competitive races as we get closer to the midterm elections, but above all, Trump’s immense popularity and ability to raise large sums of money makes him even more powerful in the Republican party,” Cooperman added. According to FEC financial disclosures, Save America spent more than $3m on events through February, $2m on consulting services, including to law firms representing witnesses sought by committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot, including the Trump aide Dan Scavino and Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich. It also spent $300,000 on ads, $200,000 in contributions to Republican congressional candidates, and at least $170,000 at hotels owned by Trump for lodging, meals and the renting of hotel facilities. Budowich, communications director for both Save America and Trump, told Reuters that the former president was supporting candidates through direct contributions, rallies and joint fundraisers – in other words, efforts that bind candidates to the former president. “Save America will not be telegraphing specific tactics or expenditures through the press,” Budowich told the news agency. “Every dollar raised will go to ensuring President Trump’s “America first” agenda is advanced through his endorsed candidates and causes.” “There is a lot of leeway to how the funds are spent,” says Michael Beckel of Issue One, a non-partisan group that advocates for campaign finance reform. “While he remains an unofficial candidate he can build his brand, draw further attention to himself by hosting large rallies, ostensibly to support other candidates in other states, but every rally has the upside of helping to boost his visibility and brand.” Trump is certainly on the move, holding rallies across the US with the usual aim of endorsing local supportive politicians. In some ways, it’s a substitute for social media blackout, in another it’s Trump connecting with his base in the way that has served him in the past. Earlier this month, he held a rally in South Carolina in support of Russell Fry, a state representative he endorsed to challenge the incumbent Republican congressman Tom Rice. Fry spoke briefly, before handing the podium back to Trump who continued for 20 minutes. “In 2024 we are going to take back that beautiful White House. I wonder who will do that. I wonder, I wonder,” Trump teased. But the consequences from straying from Trump’s agenda are also apparent. Last week, the former president withdrew his endorsement of Mo Brooks for “going woke” after the Alabama Senate candidate expressed doubt that the 2020 presidential election was a fraud. “Mo Brooks of Alabama made a horrible mistake recently when he went ‘woke’ and stated, referring to the 2020 presidential election scam, ‘Put that behind you, put that behind you,’” Trump said, as he withdrew his endorsement. But Trump’s enduring influence efforts are not limited to rallies or building his power base. Last Tuesday, Axios reported that Donald Trump Jr is planning to launch a mobile news app after the bumpy launch of Truth Social, a Trump-aligned social media network “that encourages an open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating against political ideology”. The aggregator site comes with high ambitions to compete with Apple and Google’s news aggregators, and to supplant the Drudge Report that has lost traffic and influence since founder Matt Drudge undercut the White House message on Covid deaths at the peak of the pandemic. A spokesman said that the news site, MxM (short for “Minute by Minute”), will carry the tag “mainstream news without the mainstream bias” and would carry news “from a variety of publishers across the ideological spectrum”. With about 12 employees, an ideologically copacetic news site, could be a useful too. But it is still Trump’s money that is the focus of interest when it comes to his future ambitions. Under election finance laws, should Trump decide to run in 2024, he would have to start a new campaign fund. His previous pac committee, Donald J Trump for President (since renamed The Make America Great Again Pac) still has more than $6m in it, after raising $13m in 2021. “The life of a political action committee after a candidate leaves office can morph to supporting other candidates,” explained Beckel. “The bulk of the money Trump has been raising is for Save America, but he also has a conduit vehicle so a donor can write one check and it’s split between buckets according to political contribution limits.” But how Trump will spend the money remains an open question, Beckel says. “He could shape the 2022 midterms or other future elections significantly if he decides to unleash it. One can predict from how other former president or politicians have spent their money, but Donald Trump is not a conventional politician.”",News/US news,Questions abound as Trump raises – and hoards – huge sums of 2024 cash ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/27/trump-cash-money-raising-election-2024
3/27/2022,"From Charles Dickens to Sylvia Plath to Eminen, many of the world’s most creative adults had a turbulent childhood. Now Gerry Anderson, the creator of Thunderbirds and Stingray, all of whose shows have no mother character, can be added to the list. Previously unbroadcast interviews reveal that Anderson’s work lacked matriarchal figures because Anderson was so traumatised by his own relationship with his mother. A forthcoming documentary draws on more than 30 hours of interviews with Anderson, recorded years before his death in 2012, but not released until now. He had found worldwide success, delighting generations of fans with 18 series and four feature films, which included Space: 1999 and Captain Scarlet. But Anderson had never got over the death of Lionel, his older brother, a handsome and heroic pilot who had died during the second world war; he also never recovered from the shock of hearing their mother, Debbie, say: “Why was it Lionel? It should have been you.” Gerry was then 12, and had idolised his brother, who was 20 when his plane was shot down in 1942. Their mother had always focused her love on Lionel rather than on Gerry or her husband, Joe, whom she repeatedly humiliated during the course of their marriage. Anderson recalled in those interviews: “My mother was … always saying how she … hated the marriage. The mixture was explosive. I had the most miserable childhood.” He added: “My mother used to humiliate him and, when I was a kid, used to say to me jokingly, ‘come on, you ugly devil, you look more like your dad every day of the week.’ It used to break my heart because I was brought up to think my father was ugly, so when she’d say that to me, I used to get very upset.” It took its toll on his confidence: “I always feel that I have failed.” Anderson’s son, Jamie, appears in the documentary, Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted, and is one of its producers. He told the Observer that Anderson’s troubled childhood had had a profound effect on his work and that, while there are no mothers in any of his shows, the heroes are pilots and strong characters who embody elements of his brother. In those interviews, Anderson also recalled that his interest in space travel was inspired by Lionel: “I remember my brother [saying], ‘assuming it were possible to fly in a straight line across the universe, you must eventually come to the edge of the universe and if so, what is beyond?’. Well, of course, that kind of mind-boggling question really set me thinking and has kept me going until today.” Jamie Anderson said that the recordings were never meant for publication: “It was my decision to allow them to be out in the world.” He said that Debbie’s chilling remark to her son was “unforgivable”, adding: “You’ll never forget someone saying something like that, and we have got footage of him repeating it almost verbatim. He’d internalised it so much. In every single show, you’ve got a strong father figure, you’ve got Jeff Tracy and Colonel White. But there are no mothers. “His mother manipulated him. She spent his entire childhood making out that Joe was useless, lazy and ugly. He grew up believing that was the case, essentially being gaslit by his own mother. His parents’ failings would see Dad try to create his perfect childhood on screen, filled with toys and gadgets, but no mothers.” In the interviews, Anderson said: “My brother, and I’m quite serious when I say this, he really should have lived, and I should have been the one who was killed. I just feel that really he was more suited to go through this life than I was. I would happily have swapped places with him.” Yet such is the following for Anderson’s work that it reaches up to 15 million people a month on social media, Jamie said: “We’ll see clips go across Facebook and suddenly they’ve got one million views. There are still loads of fans out there. The shows are amazingly timeless.” The documentary, Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted, is available on BritBox from 14 April and receives its world premiere at the BFI Southbank on 9 April",Arts/Film,Why Mother’s Day was no cause to celebrate for creator of Thunderbirds,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/27/why-mothers-day-was-no-cause-to-celebrate-for-creator-of-thunderbirds-gerry-anderson
3/27/2022,"Stories on dark plum lipstick usually centre on its use in winter or Halloween. It is not obvious spring fare. That’s the point I want to make here – dark lip colour can say more than one thing. You can make it work outside the aforementioned context by going a little bit off piste and pairing it with the unexpected, as per a recent Viktor & Rolf show. They’ve taken berry lip colour and teamed it with a pretty pink blush and a wash of bronze around the eyes. Now dark lips are telling a very different story. 1.

A friend was bemoaning the inefficiency of her inexpensive black eyeliner. Miss Know It All here responded with: ‘What did you expect? It’s cheap. You should have gone to…’ Then I reeled off the usual (luxe) suspects. I wince as I type this. Anyone who has read this column long enough will know that I maintain that the cost of a product is no indication as to how effective it will be. To be fair, that was not always the case: historically, cheap beauty products have been shocking. But there is now a wealth of products that are affordable, accessible, brilliantly made and seriously effective. Which is where this incredible double-ended eyeliner (a pencil with a built-in smudger) comes in. It has a powder gel formula that is super easy to use – you can create smokey, smudgy eyes, slick sharp flicks and basic lined eyes with very little effort. It is waterproof and longwearing (I’ve tried 12 hours and it didn’t budge). And the sublime pigment is an unapologetically inky black – important, because on darker skin, most liners in this texture show up as grey. And there’s the price; £5.99.
