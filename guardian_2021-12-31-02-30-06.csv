12/31/2021,"The legendary British sprinter Ron Jones, who captained Team GB at the Mexico Olympics in 1968 and was part of the 4x110yd team that equalled the world record in 1963, has died at the age of 87. After his illustrious track and field career, Jones moved into football, first as the chief executive of QPR in 1976 before becoming managing director at Cardiff and then Portsmouth.  But he will be best remembered for being part of the British team – alongside Peter Radford, David Jones and Berwyn Jones – who stunned a strong US contingent to equal the world 4x110yd record in 40.0 secs. Writing in the Observer, Norris McWhirter said the performance was so good it made “the White City crowd explode with joy – just like in the old days”. The feat was even more impressive given the US team that day included Bob “The Bullet” Hayes, the world’s fastest man who would later win gold at the 1964 Olympics. It was a measure of Jones’s quality that when he faced Hayes in the individual 100yd dash earlier that afternoon he pushed him to the line. “The mighty Hayes, who breaks all the rules of fast movement by rocking and rolling as he fights his pigeon-toed way down the track, was expected to pull away,” wrote McWhirter. “But nothing of the sort happened. In fact Jones fractionally closed on him and was only beaten by two foot on the tape.” Hayes’s time was 9.5s, with Jones’s 9.6s. Such was Jones’s form that year he also set a Welsh 100m record of 10.30s – which stood for 27 years until it was beaten by Colin Jackson in 1990. His great friend Lynn Davies, who won long jump gold in Tokyo 1964 and ran in the GB relay team with Jones in those Olympics, told the Guardian that Jones was an “inspirational character on and off the track”. “Ron will be remembered for being one of Wales’s greatest ever athletes,” he said. “He was one of my heroes growing up and when we raced I could never beat him. He had such a smooth stride. And, remarkably, he did it all while working full-time as an accountant.” Davies said that, when Jones was managing director at Cardiff City, he would even take fitness training with the players. “And he also did a great deal for young people in sport in Wales as chairman of Sports Aid Cymru Wales.” “He was a very proud Welshman with a very warm and outgoing personality,” he added. “He loved company, and a glass of red wine. I have many happy memories of sitting with him and reminiscing about the good old days.”",Sport/Sport,"Ron Jones, sprinter and British captain at Mexico Olympics, dies aged 87",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/ron-jones-sprinter-and-british-captain-at-mexico-olympics-dies-aged-87

12/31/2021,"A paramedic who was spending his day off trainspotting with his nine-year-old son saved the life of a young man who lay down in front of a train moments before its departure. Andy Nickolls, 57, and his son Jacob were the only ones who saw the man jumping from the platform at Taunton station in Somerset and lying on the rails.  Seeing that the signal had turned to green and the train was about to move, the pair waved their hands frantically and shouted to attract the attention of the driver.

Credit to @CrossCountryUK @GWRHelp @networkrailwest safeguarding the patient to hospital for his mental health pic.twitter.com/tv2GRFkOXW Eventually realising what was happening, the driver applied his emergency brakes and station staff talked the man off the tracks. Nickolls said his son, who is obsessed with railways and has his own YouTube channel devoted to trainspotting, called Jacob’s Train Adventures, appeared to have taken the incident in his stride. “He was more resilient than I expected. At school they do a lot of work on mental health,” he said. “Not many nine-year-olds can say they have done something like that. I don’t think it was heroic, we didn’t jump in front of the train or anything but it was a positive outcome.” Nickolls said he and Jacob decided to go to Taunton station on Wednesday though it was rainy and cold and positioned themselves on the central platform. He said: “We were waiting for the train from York when out of the corner of our eyes we saw a lad hovering. The train came in and stopped and the lad lay in front of the train. The driver hadn’t seen him. “My son said: ‘Dad – quick, the signal has gone green.’ We started to shout and scream and jump up and down. The driver looked at us but couldn’t hear what we were saying. We pointed at the tracks and he eventually peered in front of his cab and must have been able to see the lad’s legs so he put the emergency brakes on.” The young man was helped and the driver gave Nickolls and Jacob a cheery wave as he drove off. Nickolls spent 31 years working for the ambulance service and now serves on the council of governors for South Western Ambulance NHS trust. He remains a registered paramedic. He said he was proud of how his son reacted. “Jacob took it really well; he was more worried about the lad. It was a split-second decision to act. The lad would have been killed instantly if the train had moved.” A British Transport Police spokesperson said the man was taken to safety. “British Transport Police received a report of concern for the welfare of a person at Taunton railway station at 11.43am on Wednesday, 29 December,” the spokesperson said. “Rail staff colleagues at the station assisted and the person was taken to a place of safety.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

12/31/2021,"Authorities in the US have shot and killed a critically endangered tiger after it bit the arm of a man who entered an unauthorized area of the tiger’s enclosure in a Florida zoo. The man, who is in his 20s and worked for an external cleaning service at the Naples zoo in Florida, suffered serious injuries after an eight-year old Malayan tiger named Eko bit him, authorities said on Wednesday.  “Preliminary information indicates that the man was either petting or feeding the animal, both of which are unauthorized and dangerous activities,” the Collier county sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post. It added that the third-party cleaning service which the man worked for is only responsible for cleaning restrooms and the gift shop, not the animal enclosures. “Initial reports indicate that the tiger grabbed the man’s arm and pulled it into the enclosure after the man traversed an initial fence barrier and put his arm through the fencing of the tiger enclosure,” the statement said. The attack, which happened after the zoo had closed for the day, prompted deputies to respond to the scene. The first deputy kicked the enclosure and attempted to get the tiger to release the man’s arm from its mouth. The deputy was eventually “forced to shoot the animal”. The man was then taken to a hospital by Collier county emergency medical services, the sheriff’s office said. Eko’s killing has prompted outrage online, with many users blaming the man for entering a restricted area. “They shot the tiger for being a tiger,” said one user on Twitter. Another user wrote: “Quite literally natural consequences for the human. Absolutely no reason to kill the tiger. Change that tragic policy.” “The tiger was just reacting on instinct – should not have been put down for this – the man was at fault,” someone else tweeted. Malayan tigers have been categorized as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Fewer than 200 mature individuals remain in the wild, compared to the over 3,000 animals in the 1950s, according to the World Wildlife Fund. For the past two decades, Naples zoo has funded saving wild tigers. In a statement announcing Eko’s arrival to the zoo last February, the zoo called Eko “a great ambassador for his species”. It added: “When guests see him, we hope they fall in love and want to learn how they can do their part to save his cousins in the wild.”",News/US news,Critically endangered tiger fatally shot at Florida zoo after biting man’s arm,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/tiger-fatally-shot-florida-naples-zoo
12/31/2021,"Germans seeking to defy a government ban on the domestic selling of fireworks before new year celebrations are heading in their droves across the border to Polish shops and factories. A ban was announced this month for a second year in a row in an attempt to prevent large gatherings during the pandemic and to ease the burden on hospitals, which regularly have to treat serious injuries such as burns and lacerated limbs resulting from pyrotechnic accidents.  It is one of a range of post-Christmas measures being introduced as Germany braces for a new wave of coronavirus caused by the Omicron variant. On New Year’s Eve, private gatherings will be limited to a maximum of 10 people who are vaccinated or recovered, excluding children under 14. Clubs and discos are not allowed to open, and restaurants can operate only under strict conditions. At one firework factory shop in Slubice, western Poland, close to the German border, people who had travelled from across Germany reported queueing for up to three hours this week, filling the boots of cars and vans before the so-called “Silvester” celebrations, which are named after a fourth-century pope and are a key event in the German calendar. A limit of 50kg of goods is allowed per vehicle, and extra police are in the area to carry out random checks, according to media reports. A majority of Germans support the ban, according to a recent YouGov poll carried out for the news agency DPA. The survey found 66% were in favour of the decision while 27% said it was wrong. The pyrotechnic industry has announced it will take legal action, calling it unfair that customers were allowed to bring fireworks in from abroad, and arguing that serious injuries were “practically impossible” if the products were used as specified in the instructions. Many accidents are caused by people taking fireworks apart and building bigger ones with the gunpowder. German firework producers make about 95% of their annual turnover of about €200m in the three days before the turn of the year when fireworks are usually allowed to be sold. Germany is the biggest market in Europe, equivalent to that of the US. Some manufacturers have said they believe the pandemic is being used as an excuse to squeeze the industry into bankruptcy. In the past, environmental campaigners, pet lovers, doctors, the fire brigade and police have campaigned in favour of an all-out ban. The pandemic has only caused pressure to mount further. Ingo Schubert, the head of the national association for pyrotechnics, said: “We’re still lacking valid data to give plausibility to the claims that a significant amount of injuries during Silvester night are caused by authorised fireworks.” He said not enough attention was paid to the role of alcohol in accidents, as confirmed by doctors who treat the injuries. He said the ban amounted to “token politics” and was in danger of backfiring at a time when politicians urgently needed to ensure that the majority of citizens back their measures to tackle the pandemic. “It is a black day for all those for whom fireworks are a much-loved Silvester custom,” he said. The new health minister, Karl Lauterbach, a medical doctor, has campaigned in the past for a ban based on the harm he said was caused in particular to people with asthma by the fine particles emitted into the air. He has said fine particles can also cause brain inflation and dementia. “Within a couple of hours of these chaotic, DIY new year celebrations you can inhale the same amount of fine particles you’d otherwise be exposed to over months,” he told the Guardian in a 2018 interview. “I cannot enjoy being outside when I know how exorbitant the contamination is on this particular night.” His message this year is even more clearly focused, but this time relates solely to the pandemic emergency. Despite the pressure it faces, the industry in Germany is hoping for an upswing next year. In the meantime, the amount of unsold fireworks – about 30,000 tons of explosives – are mounting. They are being stored in about 30 high-security locations around the country.",News/World news,Germans flock to Poland to buy fireworks in defiance of ban,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/germans-flock-to-poland-to-buy-fireworks-in-defiance-of-ban
12/31/2021,"The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial is a resounding victory for her prosecution team and especially assistant US attorney Lara Pomerantz, who become one of the high-profile figures in court. The prosecution team – led by former acting US attorney for the southern district of New York, Audrey Strauss – had faced immense pressure to secure a guilty verdict and had been portrayed as relatively youthful compared to Maxwell’s heavy-hitting defense team.  But in the end, by securing guilty verdicts on five out of six charges, including sex trafficking, the prosecution fulfilled its goals. It was a particular triumph for Pomerantz, 37, who hit the headlines by delivering the prosecution’s opening statement. She described Maxwell in clear terms as a vital enabler in her boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of his young victims and physically present. “She put them at ease and made them feel safe, all so that they could be sexually abused by a middle-aged man. There were times when she was in the room when it happened,” she said. Pomerantz’s words set a tone for the whole trial, as the prosecution hit home its message that the crimes were not just the acts of Epstein, but of Maxwell too. “They were partners in crime. They had a playbook,” Pomerantz said. The Maxwell trial is not Pomerantz’s first-high profile case involving sex crimes though. In August 2016, she oversaw the prosecution of six men who were charged with trafficking minors and in September 2020, she helped lead the prosecution of United Nations employee Karim Elkorany for attempting to cover up sexual assaults while working for the international body. Currently, Pomerantz works with the SDNY’s Public Corruption Unit, which deals with bribery, corruption, embezzlement, and fraud. It often works closely with the FBI and other federal, state, and city agencies. Before working for the US department of justice, Pomerantz was in private practise at the New York law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Pomerantz studied at Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania law school, where she in 2006 won a Fulbright scholarship to study the future of sex education in the Dominican Republic. She is married to fellow lawyer Jonah Ari Peppiatt. According to a wedding announcement in the New York Times, the pair met at a “Festivus” party in 2010, a holiday celebration made famous in an episode of TV sitcom Seinfeld.",News/US news,Maxwell guilty verdict a triumph for prosecution’s Lara Pomerantz,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/maxwell-guilty-verdict-prosecution-lara-pomerantz
12/31/2021,"In his seminal work on nationalism, Eric Hobsbawm wrote that “the imagined community of millions seems more real as a team of 11 named people.” He meant that as a criticism – the line is drawn from a passage where the historian described the use of sport, especially football, to inculcate nationalist fervour in Europe during the interwar years. “The individual, even the one who only cheers, becomes a symbol of his nation himself,” Hobsbawm added. But in 2021, the power of sport for good was firmly on display. Amid the darkest year for Australia in decades, sport has offered hope, distraction and unity. When a majority of Australians were midway through a bruising lockdown, the nation’s Olympians and Paralympians delivered inspiration and joy in equal measure. The somewhat-fragile imagined community of Australia manifested on the shoulders of its successful athletes in Tokyo.  And what success it was. Australia’s 17 Olympic gold medals this year equalled its best performance ever, matched only by Athens 2004. After a slide down the medal table at London 2012 and then Rio 2016 (where the green and gold took home just eight gold medals), Tokyo represented an emphatic return to form for a historically dominant sporting nation. In the pool, Australia’s swimmers had their best ever Olympics. Emma McKeon’s seven medals, including four golds, made her the most-decorated Australian athlete at a single Olympics. A new golden generation emerged before our eyes – Ariarne Titmus dethroned American Katie Ledecky as queen of the pool, while backstroke supremo Kaylee McKeown had viewers in tears as she paid tribute to her recently-deceased father after each of her three gold medals. Aged just 21 and 20 respectively, the pair have distinguished careers ahead of them. Australians dominated on top of the water, too, in rowing, surfing and canoeing. Owen Wright and Jess Fox offered lessons in determination and persistence – Wright won bronze as surfing made its Olympic debut, five years after he suffered what could have been a career-ending injury, while the flying canoeist Fox won the gold medal that had eluded her for a decade. At the Tokyo stadium, sprinter Rohan Browning came agonisingly close to breaking the 10-second barrier, while Peter Bol captivated the nation with his endurance in the 800m and his eloquence in the spotlight. On the last weekend of Olympic action, the Boomers finally won Australia’s first men’s basketball medal, led by the inspirational Patty Mills, who had earlier become the first Indigenous athlete to carry Australia’s flag in the opening ceremony. It felt, at least momentarily, that a divided nation had come together; to collectively celebrate victory, mourn defeat and appreciate the raw humanity of sport. “To Australia I’m thankful,” Bol said after winning his semi-final. “We’re just human at the end of the day. We inspired the whole nation – that’s the goal.” While the Olympics and subsequent Paralympics offered a temporary reprieve from a difficult reality (plus, some months later, a maiden T20 World Cup triumph for Australia’s cricketers), the joy did not last. The AFL and NRL’s high-profile vaccine mandate dilemmas were not a distraction but a microcosm of wider societal tensions over the jab. One of Australia’s premier cycling teams accepted sponsorship cash from Saudi Arabia as part of the murderous regime’s efforts at sportwashing its image, while Winter Olympians were left in an invidious position by the silence of international and Australian Olympic committees on China’s human rights record as the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing loom. Just as Australia at large was grappling with an allegation of gender-based and sexual violence – most prominently at Parliament House – so too did a cloud of abuse and mistreatment linger over sport. Six months before its parliamentary equivalent, the Australian Human Rights Commission released a report on “systemic” problems in gymnastics. A lawyer who represented numerous athletes during the inquiry described the sport as a “petri dish for abuse”. On the eve of the Olympics, Rio medallist Maddie Groves made allegations of abuse and mistreatment within swimming. More recently, an investigation by the ABC raised separate allegations of historical sexual abuse in the sport. Football and hockey also confronted concerns about high-performance culture over the past 12 months, while an independent review found that AFL club Collingwood had a culture of structural racism. The NRL continues to grapple with allegations of domestic and sexual violence against star players. While it is depressing to admit, perhaps none of this should surprise us. We know, both anecdotally and empirically, that Australia has a sexual harassment problem, an abuse problem and a racism problem. Just as sport offers a vivid image of our imagined communities – a heady mix of tribalism and nationalism – so too does it reflect society itself. We would be naïve to think otherwise. If harassment is rife in our parliament, why wouldn’t it be prevalent in our locker-rooms? Both must be urgently addressed. 2021 was a year which highlighted the best and worst of Australian sport. The same can be said of Australian society as a whole. Hopefully 2022 offers more highs and less lows – that, surely, is something we can all cheer for.",Sport/Sport,Australian sport in 2021: a bright year despite predictably dark clouds | Kieran Pender,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/31/australian-sport-in-2021-a-bright-year-despite-predictably-dark-clouds
12/31/2021,"After two years of online learning, it wasn’t only students who were looking forward to farewelling “Zoom university”, many staff were also hopeful of a return to campus and a bit of normality in 2022. “Being surrounded by students who are passionate about this thing that you’re passionate about as well is energising,” Tito Ambyo, a journalism lecturer at RMIT, says. “And now, especially if you’re in a classroom where students don’t turn on their video cameras, it’s tiring.”  But what counts as “normal” on university campuses has changed during the pandemic – and a return to campus doesn’t necessarily spell relief for teaching staff. As international students began arriving in Australia in December for the first time since closed borders locked them out of the country in March 2020, many faculty members were busily planning the adoption of hybrid teaching models next year. Some universities, like Curtin University and the University of Tasmania, have ditched all in-person lectures in favour of online broadcasts. Others, including the University of Melbourne, will provide both in-person and online learning. The National Tertiary Education Union, says the proliferation of dual learning is leading to the exploitation of university staff, who aren’t being adequately compensated for the extra time and effort they are putting in to cater to both in-person and online students. The union’s president, Dr Alison Barnes, says a union survey showed the pivot to online learning has led to significantly increased workloads and an increase in unpaid hours. That, combined with a lack of support from universities, has affected the work-life balance of teaching staff as well as their ability to disengage during non-work hours. “Members have reported increased stress and anxiety, and many have suffered from workload burnout,” Barnes says. Staff have other concerns too. Ambyo partially attributes his online teaching fatigue to the amount of extra time he spends looking at screens, but he also worries about how to protect the intellectual rights of teaching materials shared online amid increasing casualisation and job cuts. “[The university] basically can kick you out and use your online teaching materials,” he says. “I think there’s also that fear of what that mean[s] for the future of our careers.” Elizabeth Brogan, a nursing lecturer at University of Technology Sydney says online teaching also makes it difficult for relationships to develop between students, which could in turn prevent them from acquiring the skills they should gain from their time at university. “[Students] don’t build those peer-to-peer relationships where they can talk to their friends in the classroom,” says Brogan, adding that interpersonal communication skills are part of the nursing undergraduate curriculum. “Nursing is a very social workforce,” she says. Brogan is also concerned that not all students have good internet connections, which can create accessibility issues. There are benefits to online teaching too. Ambyo has found it better for engaging introverted students. And he says digital technology can enrich teaching content. Diarmuid Cooney-O’Donoghue, a tutor in Asia-related subjects, agrees, saying it’s more convenient for students to access materials and notes, while he can use tools like Zoom breakout rooms to guide students in discussions. A PhD candidate researching academic freedom and the Chinese Communist party’s influence on Australian campuses, Cooney-O’Donghue says online tutorials can also encourage international students to join discussions on sensitive topics. “When you’re discussing human rights in China or something like that, if it’s in person, there’s no way to hide,” he says. “But if it’s online, you can blank out who that person is, and there are advantages for those students to be able to discuss something without having their identity revealed.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nevertheless, Cooney-O’Donghue doesn’t think the benefits of online teaching outweigh what is lost from in-person interactions. “I just think it’s much harder to give good feedback to students when they are not in class,” Cooney-O’Donghue says. “You don’t know who they are, and often students don’t engage as much.” Jan Sam, a Melbourne resident and psychology student has found online learning a double-edged sword. Sam, a 23-year-old Malaysian international student living with disability, found the lockdown significantly increased their difficulty in walking. In March, when in-person tutorials were available in their subjects, Sam chose to continue studying online as they worried about their safety when traveling to campus. But online learning created a new accessibility issue for Sam, who has auditory processing disorder: they couldn’t follow what lecturers were saying on pre-recorded lectures without closed captions, and couldn’t immediately understood tutors’ instructions on Zoom. Sam hopes online learning will still be an option as universities embrace the new Covid normal, albeit with some improvements. “If online learning is continued, there should be closed captions. There should be subtitles so that students can read what the tutor and the lecturers are saying.” Education experts say regardless of online or in-person classes, higher education teaching should be tailored to the needs of students. Andrew Norton, a professor in the practice of higher education policy at ANU, analysed results of the Student Experience Survey, a federal government initiative. It shows “only fairly small declines” in satisfaction with questions related to teaching during Covid-19, he says. “I think part of the problem is online teaching that is carefully planned and has all the right technology is actually pretty good,” Norton says. “But what a lot of students experienced last year – probably to a lesser extent this year – was courses that were supposed to be delivered on campus for a couple of weeks were delivered online instead.” Norton says reductions in government funding for higher education may encourage universities to offer bigger classes, which could push them to turn to online teaching to reduce costs. Glenn C Savage, an associate professor of education policy at the University of Western Australia, says universities need to offer more support for teaching staff to develop online teaching skills. “I think universities are becoming much more aware that there’s online learning, and then there’s good online learning, and they’re very different things,” says Savage. As they adopt a hybrid of online lectures and in-person tutorials, Savage says universities risk losing students. “If things move too much online, and students lose that connection to the materials, space of the university campus and so on, I think students will start thinking, ‘Why do I go to my local university when I can go to another university?” The chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, says before the pandemic, Australian universities were already providing both face-to-face and online courses. “That blend of a rich range of options will continue, with high-quality teaching and exceptional student experience very much at the centre of any decision.”",News/Australia news,Will Australian university campuses ever be the same again post-pandemic?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/will-australian-university-campuses-ever-be-the-same-again-post-pandemic
12/31/2021,"My mum used to share a holiday house with her brothers and sisters down on the Mornington Peninsula. When they told us one year they wanted to sell it, my cousin, sister and I so desperately wanted to keep it that we came up with an idea: we’d start throwing mini festival parties in summer to show them how many people loved the house.  Every February, we invited people to camp, and we’d book about 20 local acts – always trying to make these events really special. Sometimes we created interesting collaborations; other years there were one-off performance art events. But finally the time came: the house was put on the market. We’d have one last send-off, so we decided to hold that year’s event on the water. We hired a violinist and trumpeter – and a group of fiddlers – to lead everyone down from the grass to the shore. We formed a conga line, all dancing down the street, down the steep little cliff path towards the beach, where we were met by a surprise. Musician Oliver Mann was there to greet us, in the water just above his knees, serenading us with opera. The water was so still it looked like glass; you could see his reflection so perfectly. We all lay in the water – it was one of those stinking hot days – listening to his offer. We had timed it so well too. The sun was just setting – it looked as if the bay was on fire. We live in a painting, I thought. It was one of those moments when you realise just how gorgeous Australia is. From there, everyone started partying as night fell. We’d set up a sound system and we danced until the early hours. (Dancing on sand was, of course, an epic leg workout.) I have snatches of memories from that party: points where slowed-down bootleg remixes started playing, and it felt like everything was happening in slow motion; lying in the boat shed with my head melting into the steps. People slowly peeled away, returning to the campsite, and at sunrise, there were only a few of us left. As usual, I’d wandered off – which is something I tend to do at parties – and I found myself in a canoe, high on mushrooms, with a boombox blasting Mariah Carey. I cannot explain how I got into that canoe – but there I was, enjoying the bliss while someone else paddled out. If I’d had my senses about me, I would’ve thought being out at sea in a tiny boat was a little bit dangerous. But the sun was rising. My friends were on the shore. You could see all the way down to the bottom of the sand. And Touch My Body was playing. So there was no fear – just the safest feeling. That day, as we all woke up and started to recover, we made our classic morning-after meal: just three to four packets of mi goreng to yourself topped up with fried eggs and peas and butter. The meal you had when you knew you’d had the perfect evening. I realised I had managed to work myself so hard that my legs were cramped and stiff as boards – well worth it for the night that was. The ending was so bittersweet. We were never going to have this house again; it was the last party down that side of the coast where I’d spent my whole childhood. But we’d had a beautiful moment, shared with everyone – a story we would tell in years to come.

12/31/2021,"You know it has been a bumper year for Australian television when shows as good as The Newsreader and Firebite get listed in the bottom half of the top 10 titles. The stench of 2021 provided a challenging period that most of us would like turfed into the dustbin of history – and yet the excellent output of the Aussie screen sector reminds us there are some things worth saving. From an exhilarating vampire series to a euthanasia black comedy, a trippy science show and more, here are the best Australian TV shows of the year.  Premiering at Revelation film festival in 2020 and arriving on ABC iView in March, this two-part series captures the journey towards death for the lovable and articulate 90-year-old Laura Henkel, who decided to end her life on her own terms and asked her daughter and granddaughter – Cathy Henkel and Sam Lara – to make a documentary about it. The result is a production told with a tenderness that could only come from family connection, the film-makers imbuing it with ruminative qualities including voiceover narration in the form of letters to their beloved matriarch. With a warmth and softly inquisitive style that reminded me of Sarah Polley’s Stories We Tell, Laura’s Choice demonstrates the power of framing important social issues through a personal lens. Though sad in some respects, it’s an ultimately uplifting story: a celebration of a woman who did it her way, as they say, and left behind a deeply meaningful legacy. Creator Michael Lucas and director Emma Freeman’s 1980s-set period drama, based in the world of television journalism, has a slightly glossed-over vibe – evoking a feeling that some of the rough edges of history have been smoothed. And yet the series, starring Anna Torv and Sam Reid as colleagues and potential lovers working in a TV newsroom, is crafted with a dignified sensibility and uses historical events as dramatic scaffolding. Sometimes these events are fun and innocuous (Paul Hogan winning the 1985 Australian of the Year award) and sometimes dark and tragic (the Aids crisis and how it was reported). The elegance of the show’s compositions and the relatability of its well-developed characters keeps it a pleasure to watch. In Warwick Thornton and Brendan Fletcher’s revisionist vampire series, blood-sucking fiends are sent to hell via boomerangs to the heart. Tyson (Rob Collins) and his adopted daughter Shanika (Shantae Barnes-Cowan) patrol the outskirts of Opal City, “keeping this mob safe” before the arrival of head vamp “The King” (Callan Mulvey) throws relative stability into chaos. Death by boomerang is one small example of how Firebite reinvigorates dusty old genre tropes with a fresh Indigenous perspective, which leads to fascinating political allegories: in this universe, for instance, vampires arrived on the first fleet. The show’s scuzzy junkyard aesthetic is vaguely reminiscent of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, another production (like Firebite) featuring scenes shot in and around Coober Pedy. The ongoing debate about euthanasia and assisted dying doesn’t exactly scream “hilarious”. But this topical and wittingly entertaining series from creator and writer Samantha Strauss turns it into comedy gold, albeit of the darkly humorous kind, walking a tightrope between morbidity and absurdity. An ultimately humanistic spirit shines through in the story of Kate (Frances O’Connor), a doctor who works in palliative care and is opposed to assisted dying – though her perspective changes after her mother, Edie (Harriet Walter), tries to take her own life. The tone is provocative and a little off-kilter, with occasional moments that take your breath away – including a surreal scene featuring Roy Billing ascending a ladder into the sky. Modern phenomena such as cancel culture and identity politics are, from a comedian’s perspective, opportunities for joke-making but also dangerous minefields to navigate. This prickly comedy (created by Naomi Higgins, Humyara Mahbub and Mark Bonanno) about a trio of super-entitled and opportunistic gen Zers – Mia (Olivia Junkeer), Penny (Higgins) and Austin (Wil King) – rushes right in, entering the domain of the brave and the damned, finding satire in our rapidly evolving cultural mores. The underlying message is that opportunistic human behaviour will always continue despite and even because of positive cultural change. It’s a ballsy premise, finding dark humour in exploitation of issues including gender, ethnicity and religion. Originating from Peter Temple’s novels and journeying to the screen in three telemovies and three TV seasons, the final outing of Guy Pearce’s cardigan-wearing gumshoe is a return of sorts to his roots, the plot of a new investigation retrospectively revealing details about the murder of his wife – which kicked off the first Jack Irish telemovie. In addition to the twisty plotting and pacy execution we have come to expect, the third season has an emotional kick, with poignant character arcs and a satisfying “this time it’s personal” plot. Sprinkled with visions of cafes, pubs and laneways, Australian neo-noir is rarely as good, and rarely as Melbourne. “White knuckle” is a term critics usually apply to thrillers and action movies, but this alarmingly good investigatory series reminds us that it can describe documentaries too. Comprising three feature-length instalments, the focus is an almost unbelievably horrific real-life tragedy: a fire in Sydney’s Luna Park in 1979 that burnt down the titular ride, resulting in the death of six boys and a man. A prolonged nerve-jangling sequence in the first episode weaves together witness accounts and dramatic recreation, resulting in one of the most electrifying scenes I have seen in any Australian documentary. Core to the show’s integrity is the excellent journalism of Caro Meldrum-Hanna and her team, who approach a dusty old story with newfound urgency. There’s an uneasy relationship between comedy and menace across all three seasons of Mr Inbetween, and more broadly in the work of its excellent director Nash Edgerton. Scott Ryan is unforgettably good as Ray Shoesmith, a hitman who keeps the kind of company you’d expect – including an amusingly dodgy best friend (Justin Rosniak) – but also has a cute young daughter (Chika Yasumura) and a pleasant girlfriend (Brooke Satchwell). Rather than milking the “hitman with a heart of gold” cliche, Edgerton performs his signature combination, mixing uneasiness with humour. One moment Ray has arrived to rough up a goon; the next, he’s sitting down for a cuppa and a chinwag with the bloke’s mother. I can hear the colours, man! I can see the sounds! Science meets art in this trippy and visually gobsmacking short-form YouTube series, which has an additional 28-minute compilation episode available on ABC iView. It turns a laboratory into a film set, creating amazing effects by mixing chemical compounds and accompanying them with an expansive electro soundtrack from the Presets’ Kim Moyes. Separated into episodes devoted to different scientific fields (electricity, energy, matter and magnetism), director Josef Gatti embraces the magic of chemistry rather than the magic of motion pictures. Or, to look at it another way, he demonstrates that they can be one and the same, finding the ultimate effects in properties that bind together the known universe – elements that are, in the words of Phenomena’s narrator, “written in the patterns of nature”. Nothing breaks realism quite like characters bursting into song – a risky concept for even experienced film-makers to execute. There is indeed an element of risk-taking in this wonderfully inventive and superbly staged drama (created by Kristen Dunphy and directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse and Kim Mordaunt), which is not a musical per se but occasionally features singing and dancing, as well as taking on other tough challenges – including how to visually illustrate an earworm. Nik (Rudi Dharmalingam), a psych nurse at a mental health facility, gets Come On Eileen stuck in his head, which sounds innocent enough but it in fact threatens to unravel the skein of his sanity. Very skilfully executed from go to whoa, with narrative loose ends and thematic callbacks that take the entire eight episodes to resolve, Wakefield is exquisite, deeply moving television.",Arts/Television & radio,From The Newsreader to Wakefield: the 10 best Australian TV shows of 2021 ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/31/from-the-newsreader-to-wakefield-the-10-best-australian-tv-shows-of-2021
12/31/2021,"I divorced my husband after his affair eroded our 22 year marriage (three children). We then had new spouses for another 20 years. He has now left his wife and is with the woman he was involved with during our marriage (her husband died). My children were initially abhorred by this union once I told them who she was, and the pain the affair caused me. She frequented our house whilst the affair was going on. But my children are slowly accepting her.  I know I can’t make them feel the way I do but this feels like the ultimate betrayal to me. This woman is by stealth moving in on my family once again, and they are accepting her. Please help me not to feel this way about their father and my adult children, it is ruining my life. Eleanor says: I don’t know why people say time heals all wounds when often after years the same wound hurts as badly and the only difference is other people expect it won’t. The first thing I want to do here is commend you for wanting to change this. Plenty of people wouldn’t. Especially in the grip of fear and betrayal, many of us turn our own reactions into concrete truths; we move from “this makes me feel betrayed” to “I’m being betrayed”, from “I feel invaded again” to “They’ve set out to invade me”. The fact that you haven’t done that speaks to your dignity as a person and your strength as a mother. Happily, it also proves why you’re the kind of parent who won’t easily be discarded: by wanting to be rid of this feeling, you’ve already shown how much you love your children and prioritise their wellbeing. That’s the kind of selfless regard kids detect and cherish even well into their adulthood. Two additional thoughts might help when you feel the bile rising. One is to try to separate this actual woman from what she (reasonably) represents. Sometimes the Other Woman can take on a spectral, shapeshifting quality; she’s a shadow disappearing down a hallway, her only known characteristic that she’s not you. Like the monster in the horror movie before you actually see it, she becomes an amalgam of all fears – even when they’re contradictory. But just like the monster, she’s less scary once known. She invariably turns out to be just some person who gets things stuck in her teeth and misses the bus like the rest of us. Though it’s natural this particular woman would roil up feelings of neglect and abandonment, those feelings are bruises, not predictions. She herself is not the loss of your home life (you already survived that), or the end of your children’s love (no chance). She’s just Carol, or Susan, or whatever her name is, and she has edges and boring bits too. If you were ever able to find a complex peace with your ex-husband about the affair, you may someday find that with her – once she strikes you as a regular old person. The other thought is that when we feel scared, threats can look bigger than they are. We confuse the long shadow of a horrible possibility for the possibility itself. You talk about this woman “moving in” by “stealth”; the echo of being invaded or compared. But there is space between her getting to know your kids and you being devalued or at risk. The kids might have dinner or holidays with her, but I promise that doesn’t mean they’re replacing you or that they’ve forgotten about your pain. They may just be guided by the same thought you are; “how can I act normal for everyone else’s sake?”. You don’t have to heal from this completely to declare it’s in the past. It will still hurt. But let it hurt at the size it is – a reminder of pain; not the size it wants to be – a sign of more to come. In time you’ll be able to feel what Emma Thompson said years after Kenneth Branagh’s affair with Helena Bonham Carter; “it’s all blood under the bridge”.

12/31/2021,"Like many others, I spent a significant portion of 2021 in activewear. As a plus-size woman, my choice of activewear was somewhat limited. Now that dressing to leave the house is back on the cards, I’m doing it with comfort, joy and rebellion at the front of my mind. I’m a 34-year-old fat woman – I use the word fat with love, as a neutral descriptor of my size – and I have felt locked out of the “fun” of dressing for most of my adult life. I spent years in my early adulthood thinking more deeply about the size and shape of my body than anything happening outside of it. This bought me the privilege of fitting into “straight-sized” clothes, but it also means that time of my life is a blur of calorie counting, uphill runs, guilt, shame and punishment.  Nevertheless, when I went to loud, sweaty gigs in tiny pubs I was able to do it wearing fitted tartan pants and a ripped-up T-shirt that told the world I didn’t care what anyone else thought. This is the power of getting dressed: it turns your body into a billboard where you can project your values, moods, tastes and desires. At least, this is the power for thin people. When I quit dieting, I also had to quit expressing myself through my clothing choices. The options available for dressing a larger body, especially on a minimal budget, are few and often poorly made. My beloved band T-shirts gave way to hoodies, purely because the sizing was more inclusive. I started wearing loose shirts in the hope of hiding my belly. Getting dressed shifted from being about self-expression to being about camouflaging my shame. The power of clothes is targeted to plus-size people in particular ways. Here are a few of the main themes: it’s part of a weight-loss redemption story; it’s a product that controls your unruliness (hello, tummy-holding-in undies!); or you are exceptional (“pretty for a fat girl” style). Black used to feature prominently. Now it’s more about florals. What is offered in extended sizes from mainstream brands often puts ethics on the backburner, so that plus-size people are denied the opportunity to put their money where their values are and are forced to opt for fast fashion instead. Extended sizing often isn’t carried in store, so plus-size people must shop online, consult size guides with a tape measure handy, and pray to the online shopping gods (AND pay shipping) instead of wandering into a store like their straight-sized friends. Because I’m a “small fat”, extended sizing usually includes me. This is not true for people in larger bodies. There’s still a way to go in extending this right to all people. Luckily, local designers are filling the gap. Small designers are coming forward who tailor exclusively for larger-bodied people, providing a personal connection to what we wear and accountability for its production. Some bigger brands are slowly expanding their size ranges as they realise that catering for a broader portion of the population is profitable. I’m learning to dress in ways that make me happy: what’s comfortable, what feels good, what makes me feel powerful and capable. Relinquishing the activewear and returning to the office has especially made me question who I’m looking presentable and put-together for. While living in activewear, I learned new lessons about clothes and my fat body. For example, I can be comfortable and other people don’t get to be offended by that. A big meeting calls for brand new socks. I keep a stash in my bedside drawer for occasions when I need to feel held and safe; the unworn fibres cradle my arches and I know I’ve got this. I swish back into the office wearing palazzo pants, my curly hair large and defined. In a world that demands for me not to take up space, here I am. I can move up and down the staircase with ease. I can sit how I like during meetings. I am powerful and capable. I kick intentionally against the lessons I’ve been handed by unreasonable beauty standards and a biased fashion industry. For example: bellies are bad, the more pronounced the worse, so hide them. Mentally scrunching up the Post-it of shame and discomfort, I put a belt around mine and march into the day. Big earrings are joy. Sometimes they explicitly state my message (CUTE hangs from one earlobe and CURVY from the other), others times they’re more subtle. A little gold fleck winking from underneath my hair. Because I live in a bigger body, dressing for joy is a radical act. I’m expressing myself, yes, but I’m also a living message to bigger-bodied people around me that says: “We have the right to take up space, too.” All the messaging I’m surrounded by tells me that nothing could flatter my plus-size body, and that excellent clothes aren’t made for me – these lessons are wrong. Carving out lessons of our own is powerful and rebellious. This summer, I’m dressing fabulously.

12/31/2021,"For Krisinda Merhi, recovering from Covid while isolating in her bedroom felt like “exhausting nothingness”. “You’re tired from doing nothing, because you both can’t and don’t have the energy to,” she says.  The 25-year-old Sydneysider contracted Covid after a trip to Melbourne in November. It started with “slight congestion and a persistent cough”. At first she thought it was “just allergies”, and a negative result from a precautionary rapid antigen test supported this. It was following a dinner, where she couldn’t taste anything, that Merhi began to panic. “I got a Covid test the next morning.” Later that afternoon, while watching television with her family, the PCR test came back positive. “We all went into crisis mode,” she says. Merhi instantly relocated to her bedroom, where she stayed isolated for a week. Luckily, her family of five, who isolated inside the home as close contacts, all remained negative. As daily Covid numbers surpass 12,000 in New South Wales, and “worst case” Covid modelling suggests 200,000 cases a day nationwide by late January, Prof Jayashra Kulkarni says isolation inside the home as either a Covid-positive person or close contact is becoming “a common experience now”. Kulkarni is a professor of psychiatry from Monash University, and has isolated in her home as a close contact of a Covid-positive family member. She says “it is helpful to know you are not alone”. “Once a family member is detected to be positive, the immediate response is to be anxious,” she says. But Kulkarni reminds us that “human beings are designed to cope with crises”. “The news can hit you like a lightning bolt,” she says, describing “unsettling” feelings of upheaval and disappointment. “Don’t be afraid to have that emotional reaction. It will pass. “Then, you will regroup and reimagine what you need to do to deal with what is in front of you.” Here’s what to do if you test positive and need to isolate. Kulkarni says the first consideration should be “dealing with infection control” inside the home. She recommends isolating the Covid-positive individual to their own area, like a bedroom. She also urges they use “their own bathroom facility, if you can”. If that isn’t possible, Kulkarni says, “you need to rethink” how to protect the “space, air and things” touched by the Covid-positive person. “Most people can isolate in a bedroom, and negotiate times for the shared bathroom.” As the virus is aerosol-borne, Kulkarni says wearing masks inside your house, “as bizarre as it sounds”, is critical protection. She suggests “double masking” with surgical masks if there is no access to medical-grade N95 masks. In common spaces, “ventilation with outside air” is important. “So keep the windows open.” Wearing disposable gloves while touching shared surfaces “is going to be really important”. As will be designating plates, cups, knives and forks to household members. Although “we don’t know how much of Omicron is transmitted through contact”, Kulkarni says, “you just need to keep thinking about where there is infectious possibility. “So if you’re serving food, leave it outside the door of the isolation room. When you go to collect it, pick it up with disposable gloves.” Merhi had her own washing basket, tub of used utensils and trash bag of disposables in her room. “I cleaned it all after my isolation, so no one was coming into contact with my germs.” Kulkarni’s shopping list for a week of Covid isolation inside the home includes disposable gloves, surgical masks, disinfectant wipes and “good old-fashioned boiling water” for washing. “These may be extreme, because we are not sure about transmission through surfaces with Omicron yet,” Kulkarni says. “But we can borrow worries from other variants.” Merhi suggests adding Berocca, “a lot of water” and “a vitamin regimen” including vitamin C, zinc, B12 and fish oil to the list. She also found “maintaining a diet of things rich in nutrients like fruits and vegetables” important. She recalls “feeling really exhausted, and not knowing why you’re exhausted”. “So take hot showers, drink lots of tea, and get lots of rest.” Dr Jenny H Martin, a practising physician and clinical pharmacologist of the University of Newcastle, says “staying well hydrated” is helpful to manage symptoms and discomfort. “People find it difficult to drink water, so Hydralyte is helpful.” Martin, who has also previously isolated in her home as a close contact with a Covid-positive family member, says managing Covid in a home setting “is difficult with medicine”. Similar to supporting someone through a viral illness, she suggests use of ibuprofen and anti-inflammatory medicines. Kulkarni says organising the “bits and pieces” of receiving grocery deliveries, or care-packages dropped off by friends, is another consideration. She says to ensure deliveries are “contactless” by having them dropped off at a driveway or doorstep. “After the person is gone, you can pick it up.” Symptoms in a Covid-positive person “are going to be different for different people”, Kulkarni says. “For an average, healthy person, the symptoms of the Omicron variant seem to present like a cold or flu,” Kulkarni says, describing sore throats, a blocked nose, muscle aches, tiredness and fevers. In a person with underlying, compromising health conditions, however, symptoms may be more severe. Martin says if a Covid-positive person has “gone a day” without keeping fluids down, “they may need to go to the hospital and get fluids through a drip”. Covid-positive people who are vomiting, or experiencing severe fevers that cause hallucinations or cannot be managed at home, “may also need to go to hospital”. Kulkarni also suggests close contacts who may share the home with a Covid-positive person “keep an eye on transmission” with rapid antigen tests – “for peace of mind”. “A person in isolation can feel totally cut off,” Kulkarni says. “The cleanliness factor gets hyped up, and it needs to be. But looking after mental health is important.” She says keeping up communication while in isolation is “really critical”. To feel connected to people while in isolation, Merhi video called with friends and watched movies over the phone with her partner. She also says she was “lucky” to have a balcony. “It made it a lot easier to self isolate. I could actually get fresh air. It was easier on my sanity.” Martin suggests making a list of friends and family to get in touch with, and “working through that list of people each day”. “Some people do yoga, others make at-home gyms with milk bottles filled with water,” she says. “The isolation seems like the hardest thing – just sitting in your room, counting down the hours. “So it doesn’t really matter, you just have to be engaging in something.” After the infectious period has ended, “do not disturb the room or bathroom for a day”, Martin says. “Let it settle. Then wear a mask and gloves, and clean all surfaces with disinfectant. “Have the person infected care for their own space,” she says. This includes stripping and washing bed sheets, any clothes worn, and vacuuming. Martin says to “dispose of the vacuum bag and don’t let it sit around”. She also suggests opening windows and doors on two sides of the house, and letting the airflow circulate while people in the household are outside. Kulkarni says that, amid a time of “consideration and changes”, it is important to “keep abreast” of health rules in your state. “We are in some ways in a middle ground,” she says. “Omicron appears to be a milder illness, particularly in those vaccinated. That is encouraging.” At the same time, however, people remain “concerned”. “Particularly when you see stories from overseas of long Covid, and events need to be cancelled.” “Critical” to balancing this, she says, is getting “focused and practical” about a Covid positive result, and being prepared for isolation.",News/Australia news,The Covid isolation guide: how to prepare for a positive result,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/the-covid-isolation-guide-how-to-prepare-for-a-positive-result
12/31/2021,"In a year whose emotional trajectory oscillated from a series of flatlines to over-the waterfall slumps, December arrived with the sounds of summer but little of its usual carefree joy. The first Ashes Test of early December brought with it the opening soundtrack; the clop of willow on ball and droll commentary echoed through the house while I worked through the year’s final tasks.  For weeks the main sound of “normality” – the flight path above our house – had been re-busying, the drone of aircraft engines blotting out the morning call of birdsong that had become one of the glorious upsides of lockdown, together with a cleaner harbour and skies. Travellers were coming back to this city just as we were tentatively setting foot in the coffee shops and pubs and eateries that had miraculously survived almost two years of pandemic austerity. You could hear the distant heartbeat, sense the quickening pulse, again. But then the spectre of Omicron arrived in Australia with the cricket whose languid, soothing sounds, it transpired, were deceptive of the new anxiety that now grips us. Suddenly, everything was cancelled again. Managers were sending their staff to work at home. Christmas parties were called off. Get-togethers. Restaurant bookings. Catch-ups with mates at the pub. All no longer happening. And all this, just when we thought it may no longer be necessary to dwell eternally in the present – that it was safe, perhaps, to start seriously contemplating, even pencilling in, the future without succumbing to anxiety. The new self-imposed lockdown finds irony in its coincidence with a blatantly polling-driven message from a desperate prime minister that Australians are at once sick of having governments tell them what to do and should exercise personal responsibility to combat the latest variant. While it’s evident that more of us don’t necessarily want federal and state governments to reverse the government-community onus of responsibility on pandemic public health measures, it’s increasingly apparent more of us most definitely do want his government out of our lives. I also get a distinct feeling I’m not alone in finding thoroughly galling a PM who accepts liability for so damned little (not the delayed vaccine and now booster roll-out, not the knowledge within his government of an alleged rape in the executive wing of parliament, not all the other ministerial impropriety on his watch) hectoring me about what we want while urging us to take personal responsibility? If he’s picking up on a vibe that people are sick of – and sickened by – politics he’s probably spot-on. The quieter atmospherics of a pandemic lockdown had a way of amplifying this year’s scandalous and shameful federal government shit-show – a ruckus that would ordinarily be heard above the din of a category five cyclone. But do most people really want governments out of their lives, especially in life-threatening pandemic times? Or do they actually want governments and leaders who are competent, above all honest and more concerned with public safety than the libertarian outliers they pander to in order to retain power? No. Yes. Governing competently, responsibly and for the most part relatively under-the-radar, is always desirable. Attempting invisibility, doing little even in such an emergency, because voters are sick-to-death of your scandalous bullshit, quite another. If that’s 2021 done, I can well wait for ’22. This time last year I wrote about the importance of hope. About how I bought a colourful desk diary and began planning the year: social events, trips interstate to see families, research travel, live theatre and music, holidays. It seems misguided given all that’s happened since. Time compressed. The world, the country – even the neighbourhood – shrunk. Some delights emerged, however, through the simple beauty of routine, albeit often monotonous, amid the concentrated household company of family and dogs – the four legs, whose delight at the endless companionship grew along with their humans’ ballooning claustrophobia. Like most I’m a hostage to the calendar and clock, succoured somehow, even now – amid all portents to the contrary – by some faith that 1 January and the (utilitarian, week-per-page and empty) 2022 diary on my desk holds some promise. Living in the now, I’m assured, is a surefire way to avoid the anxiety which roots itself in our fears of unknown future. But that can seem impossible. Not least when you have the future of others, especially the vulnerable elderly and the young, so firmly in mind. The young, with all their remarkable resilience, who just lost another year at school, whose federal government refuses to act in their interests on climate change mitigation amid ever more distressing signs of ecological catastrophe. (As it happened, the sound of summer – the Ashes – coincided this year with news 124 Australian species, including the bogong moth, had been added to the endangered species list.) The young, who switched off the politics of nothingness so long before their elders began to do so. That is why merely investing in hope for them right now, somehow, feels inappropriately passive. It’s well past time to engage and act. That’s why at this stage 2022 would seem to have one thing going for it: it’s a federal election year.",Opinion/Opinion,It’s an Australian summer of self-imposed lockdown.

12/31/2021,"Queensland landholders are clearing the equivalent of about 1,000 MCGs a day, including endangered ecological regions, according to state government data that raises new doubts about the accuracy of Australia’s carbon emissions claims. The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (Slats) for 2018-19 showed landholders cleared 680,688 hectares of woody vegetation, or about 0.7% of Queensland’s total.   Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Improved accuracy of remote sensing make precise comparisons with earlier years difficult. The government had said the 2017-18 clearing rate was 392,000 hectares. About 84% of 2018-19 land clearing destroyed vegetation that was at least 15 years old, the new report said. The great bulk of the deforestation, or 88%, involved land with less than 50% tree cover. The report said 3% was in ecosystems “identified as of concern”, while less than 1% of the clearing involved endangered ecological communities. Stuart Blanch, a WWF Australia conservation scientist, said the figures were “a real shocker”, deliberately released ahead of New Year’s Eve to stir up the least attention. The data also suggests Australia’s carbon emissions are worse than reported, he said. “It’s a carbon bomb for the Queensland and federal governments because it shows we are vastly underestimating carbon emissions from land clearing,” Blanch said. “That’s going to really jeopardise our net zero commitments and any 2030 abatement targets. “We’re a massive land-clearing nation. Queensland has got the vast majority of it, and the vast majority of that is for beef.” Guardian Australia sought comment from the Palaszczuk and Morrison governments. In its 2021 projections update, the federal government predicted Australia’s carbon emissions in 2030 would be 30% below 2005 levels, beating the 26-28% reduction pledged at the 2015 Paris climate summit. That estimate, though, included recent years when the land sector was deemed to have absorbed more carbon dioxide than it released. In 2019, for instance, the sector contributed a net negative 25m tonnes of CO2 equivalent, that report said. Blanch, though, said Queensland’s new dataset, which assessed changes in vegetation down to 10 sq metre satellite imagery, were three times more accurate than that used to compile the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory figures. In 2018, for instance, the federal government estimated 2018 national land clearing to be just under 370,000 hectares, well shy of the 680,000-plus hectares reported by Queensland alone in 2018-19. As Guardian Australia reported last month, an analysis by Queensland researcher Martin Taylor showed earlier technology used to compile Slats was already detecting large areas of land clearing that was not picked up by the federal survey. Glenn Walker, a senior campaigner for Greenpeace, said the Slats data was “extraordinary, horrifying figures” that showed Australia remained one of the world’s fastest deforesting nations. “Behind these figures are millions of killed and maimed native animals like koalas and huge amounts of carbon emissions from burning and rotting trees,” Walker said. “Clearly the current laws aren’t working and the beef sector isn’t taking this issue seriously. This should be a huge wake-up call to act fast before we lose more precious bushland and wildlife.” The new data also indicate changes by Queensland Labor to tighten land-clearing regulations eased by the former Liberal National government under Campbell Newman were failing, Blanch said. Areas deemed to be so-called “category X” that remain excluded from the 1999 Vegetation Management Act accounted for just over 70% of the total cleared area, the government said. Costly efforts to reduce the amount of silt washing into the Great Barrier Reef region also appear to be undermined by the land clearing. About one-third of the 2018-19 deforestation, or 217,419 hectares, occurred in catchments flowing into the reef region. About 85% of that clearing remains exempt from the law changes introduced by Labor in 2018 as category X, Blanch said. The report also showed remnant clearing increased by 58% in the important Brigalow Belt in 2018-19 from the previous year to 35,550 hectares. “The Brigalow Belt supports the highest bird diversity of any bioregion in Australia and is home to at least three species of reptiles that do not occur anywhere else in the world,” Blanch said. “So the spike in clearing here is particularly heartbreaking. “It’s very disappointing the Queensland government sat on this data. They knew it was bad news and they buried it.” The deputy premier, Steven Miles, said on Thursday a group of scientific experts would be assembled in early 2022 to better understand the study results and find ways to help avoid clearing or whether other measures were needed.",News/Environment,‘Carbon bomb’: Queensland reveals big jump in land clearing,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/31/carbon-bomb-queensland-reveals-big-jump-in-land-clearing
12/31/2021,"Industry groups have denied pressuring federal and state authorities to renege on a commitment to provide free rapid antigen tests to Australians. This is despite Scott Morrison’s claims the decision to allow “private market” operators to provide the kits was the result of concern from suppliers.  Following Thursday’s national cabinet meeting, the prime minister announced that, although the New South Wales and Victorian governments had committed to provide free RAT tests to the community, they would now only be made available to certain sectors of the community, such as those in aged care. “But for all other casual uses – you would just like to get a test or something like that – well, that is what the private market is for,” Morrison said. During his press conference Morrison suggested the decision not to provide them to the wider community free of charge was as a result of “concern” from suppliers that the tests would be made free. “[W]e believe as a result of making this change, and being very clear about who is being provided with a public test and who is not, all the private industry who gave us that advice this week, they can go now, they can book their supplies, they can get them on the shelves and not have any concern that somehow a new policy will come in and tests will be handed out to anyone who wants one,” he said. “It was agreed today that will not be the policy in Australia. Rapid antigen tests will be provided publicly at those testing centres for those who require one according to the rules I have set down and have been taken out of national cabinet today.” But the head of the peak body for manufacturers and suppliers of rapid tests, told Guardian Australia the industry did not have a position on whether they should be free or not, saying all providers had asked for was certainty about a “clear role” for the products during Australia’s pandemic response. “It doesn’t matter to us whether they’re free, subsidised or other some other thing,” said Dean Whiting, the chief executive of Pathology Technology Australia, a group which represents about 70% of rapid antigen testing suppliers in the country. “What we as an industry have been more concerned about is having a clear role for rapid testing in managing infections, in keeping the economy going and in keeping people safe. “In a sense I don’t think we really care if they are free or not in terms of supply of the tests, as long as there is a clear position from governments on the role of the tests. The industry doesn’t have a position because we sell to the government for market price and we don’t care if they are free or not. “I am on the record saying that if they were free it would improve access and equity in testing and access to tests. But that isn’t a point about market supply.” Similarly, the president of the Pharmacy Guild, Trent Twomey, said his group had not lobbied the government on the issue. “That’s not a conversation he had with us,” he said. Twomey said access to RATs “shouldn’t depend on whether or not I’ve got a disposable income and I can afford to buy them”. “So our representation to them [the federal government] has always been that there needs to be a hybrid system, because it may only be $10 or $15 a test and yes, that may be a lot cheaper than a PCR test,” he said. “But $10 or $15 per person per household twice in a seven-day period is still not affordable for some low-income earners.” Guardian Australia contacted both major supermarket providers, Woolworths and Coles, to ask whether those companies had urged the government not to make the tests free. Coles declined to comment, but in a statement Woolworths denied seeking to influence the government’s distribution of the tests. “How governments distribute the rapid antigen tests is a matter for them and we have not sought to influence those decisions,” a spokesman for the grocery giant said. Instead, a source with knowledge of the talks between industry and governments said supermarkets did not lobby for the position. Instead, it was proposed by state and federal governments, which did not want to pay for the supply required to make the tests free for all, and agreed to by both supermarkets and pharmacies. States have been scrambling to make bulk orders of rapid antigen tests in a bid to ease pressure on overwhelmed PCR testing clinics, with both NSW and Victoria confirming large orders of the RATs in recent days. In NSW, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, said as recently as Wednesday that the state government had bought a total of 50m rapid tests to be distributed for free from the end of January. But on Thursday Morrison said all states had agreed to distribute them in a more targeted way. He told media that certain industries such as health and education would be provided with the tests, as well as people who had been identified as close contacts of positive cases. “In addition to that, we’re looking at vulnerable groups of people, particularly Indigenous populations, especially in remote areas, and are looking at how we will do this in schools, so they will be a role for public provision in these circumstances,” he said. Despite that, though, an expression-of-interest form for businesses circulated by the NSW government suggests it is still considering reimbursing businesses for test kits if they are provided free to residents. “To ease the pressure on Covid-19 testing clinics, we are exploring options to provide all residents with free rapid antigen self-testing kits,” the form states. “We are taking expressions of interest from businesses that would like to be involved in the rollout of these tests. These tests must be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). We may ask successful suppliers to source, deliver and/or provide these tests free of charge to the residents of NSW. We will cover the costs to you.” In its statement, Woolworths said it had been in discussions with the NSW government over the distribution of the tests. “We want to play a constructive role in the supply of rapid antigen testing alongside governments,” a spokesman said. “We’ve already offered to support the NSW government with its rapid antigen rollout plans and would be happy to do so for other states and territories if it’s helpful.” The decision not to widely supply rapid antigen tests was criticised by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with president Michele O’Neil telling the Guardian that “nobody should be excluded from accessing rapid antigen tests because of their income or their postcode”. “Workers have been calling on the prime minister to provide greater support on rapid antigen testing, but today he has thrown them to the wolves,” she said. “Scott Morrison is putting the interests of private business above public health by refusing to make rapid antigen tests free and widely available.”",News/Australia news,Covid rapid antigen tests: suppliers deny pressing PM to abandon commitment to provide free kits,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/covid-rapid-antigen-tests-suppliers-deny-pressing-pm-to-abandon-commitment-to-provide-free-kits
