3/1/2022,"A football club in north-west Brisbane saw its $1.5m synthetic playing field damaged and equipment washed away as flood waters inundated communities in Queensland and northern New South Wales. “In one word, it’s devastating,” said Mitchelton football club technical director Joe Fenech. The season was supposed to start last weekend for the 102-year-old football club, but now Fenech predicts boots won’t be back on the field for another five or six weeks. “We spent all the budgeted money on equipment, footballs, poles, gear and kits – you name it,” he said. “We stocked it really well in a [shipping] container, and that container just floated away under the bridge.” Much of the equipment was lost or damaged and the club’s two-year-old synthetic playing field was “pulled up like a carpet”. Club president Gary Green says he has no idea how much it will cost to repair the damages but estimates it upwards of $1m. He said it wasn’t the kind of club that could pick up a bill like that on its own. “We’re going to need all the help we can get financially … we’ve got a heck of a lot of work to do.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Both Green and Fenech praised the community response, which has seen more than $5,000 in donations to a GoFundMe page in less than 24 hours and at least 100 people attending to help clean up the mess. One of those people was men’s coach Daniel Pennisi, who has spent hours helping out – doing “anything that needs to be done” – despite the ground floor of his own home being inundated with ankle-deep water. “I couldn’t do anything with my place but I could help [the club],” said Pennisi. “Once I knew my family was safe and spoke to my wife about it, I had to go and help out. It means a lot to so many people.” He said described the situation as “emotional”, especially after the challenges of the pandemic. “People are saying it creates resilience … but you know what, it’s been three years where you don’t think you can get out of it. “But we got through everything, the club had cleared any debts – all the bad things with Covid – and then for this to occur, you just go ‘wow’, how resilient can a club be? “You don’t want to chuck it in but you have to keep going for the kids.” Pennisi wants to see more than just repairs. He wants to see investment in resilience. “I don’t know how to be flood-proof … [but] we need to try and be in a position where we are stronger again.”",News/Australia news,Flood ruins synthetic field and washes away equipment at Brisbane football club,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/brisbane-football-club-synthetic-pitch-washed-away-mitchelton-bne-flood
3/1/2022,"A senior New South Wales transport official who was in contact with the minister David Elliott’s office on the night before the sensational shutdown of the state’s rail system has been placed on “directed leave” a day before she was to appear at a parliamentary hearing. Megan Bourke-O’Neil, NSW Transport’s deputy secretary for greater Sydney, had been due to answer questions at a budget estimates hearing on Tuesday about contact she had with Elliott’s office in the hours before last week’s shutdown. However on Tuesday the transport secretary, Rob Sharp, told the hearing that he had placed her on “directed leave” for three weeks. Sharp refused to answer questions about why she had been directed to take leave, calling such questions “inappropriate”. He confirmed in answer to questions that there was no intention to sack Bourke-O’Neil. Sharp said he sought advice, adhering with department guidelines, before placing Bourke-O’Neil on leave. The state’s entire rail system ground to a halt after a long-running industrial dispute between the rail workers’ union and the government led to staff being “locked out”. While Elliott initially blamed the shutdown on a strike and accused the Rail, Tram and Bus Union of “terrorist-like activity”, he later told parliament that the decision to close the network had been taken by by Sydney Trains chief executive, Matthew Longland, who said ongoing industrial action meant the network could not be operated safely. . Elliott has insisted he first became aware of the network’s closure on Monday, after he went to bed sometime between 11.10pm and 12am on Sunday. However last week, NSW Labor leader Chris Minns, under parliamentary privilege, cast doubt on the minister’s version of events, reading to parliament from a text message he said was between Elliot’s chief of staff and a senior transport official at 10.43pm which said the minister had been “briefed” and was “happy with our position”. It’s understood that Bourke-O’Neil was the senior official . Elliott has insisted in parliament that he was only warned of “significant interruptions” and not a wider shutdown. However he conceded that NSW Transport believed it had fulfilled its obligation to inform the minister. MPs were informed late on Monday that Bourke-O’Neil would not appear at Tuesday’s hearing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked by Labor’s shadow roads minister, John Graham, whether the leave would take up the entire budget estimates hearing, Sharp responded: “It goes past the estimates period.” Metropolitan roads minister, Natalie Ward, said she understood Ms Bourke-O’Neil was “very capable” and did not believe she was at risk of being fired. Labor’s shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, labelled the decision to place Bourke-O’Neil on leave “extraordinary”. A press conference with Elliott was cancelled at late notice on Tuesday due to the weather.",News/Australia news,NSW Transport official placed on leave before hearing on rail system shutdown,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/nsw-transport-official-placed-on-leave-before-hearing-on-rail-system-shutdown
3/1/2022,"A campaign to save independent Ukrainian media from being obliterated by war is gathering pace, with thousands donating cash to support news outlets reporting on the conflict. A GoFundMe page organised by a senior executive from the Kyiv Independent has raised more than £150,000 for national and regional titles scrambling to survive the chaos precipitated by the Russian invasion five days ago. Funds are being earmarked to help journalists relocate operations from Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities in peril to Warsaw, Vilnius and other neighbouring capitals, said Jakub Parusinski, chief financial officer at the Kyiv Independent and the campaign’s organiser. Separate initiatives are also under way to help secure funds for urgent immediate needs such as equipment, insurance and engineering support for websites, he said. “What we really need right now is for the world to have trusted, verified information from across the country, so that people in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus know exactly what is going on,” said Parusinski. “However important foreign correspondents from overseas news organisations are, you need local media to tell the local story.” Around 12 national titles, including the Kyiv Independent and in-depth reportage news website Zaborona, are part of the group that will benefit from funds raised. A first round of disbursals from the emergency fund is due to be made as early as next week, Parusinski said. The GoFundMe effort will be aimed specifically at helping newsrooms relocate away from danger. “For any newsroom in Kyiv, the logic looks like this: you have a small portion of your team who will stay and effectively become war correspondents,” said Parusinski. “The rest are moving west to run the website and operational stuff in places like Warsaw, Vilnius or Bratislava. We are helping to get the journalists out and set up in other capitals.” Kateryna Sergatskova, editor in chief of Zaborona, said many of her journalists were staying in Kyiv “working from the shelters under the attacks” to uncover the true face of war. She welcomed the prospect of funding to help underwrite the operational costs of emergency reporting and to establish a temporary operational hub. “Independent media are covering the actual events of the war and provide accurate, unbiased information at a time of an information war,” she said.

3/1/2022,"About the same time the Brisbane River peaked, Jenni Metcalfe came back to Grey Street at West End to check on her home. “We came back on Monday morning and the water was right up,” she said, pointing at the tide mark about 1 metre up the back wall. “So I sat in the gutter and watched it and cried.” Some of the lower-lying parts of West End – Brisbane’s eclectic inner-city suburb on the south bank of the flooded “brown snake” river – went underwater on Sunday and Monday as downpours began to ease but tides reached their peak. Queensland authorities estimate 15,000 properties sustained damage in the flooding, caused by a “rain bomb” weather system that dumped more than 1 metre of water on most of the city. The volume was roughly equal to 80% of Brisbane’s annual average rainfall. The rain fell fiercely without respite for more than three days. Brisbane’s rivers and creeks filled, then spilled into the suburbs, in some cases inundating homes that did not flood in 2011, when 33 people were killed in Queensland and much of the capital was underwater. On Saturday and early on Sunday, those at risk frantically moved their most valuable belongings to high ground. Metcalfe said she was walking along the river on Saturday and noticed the tide rising. “But I had no idea that my place would be affected. “I bought it five years ago, I thought it was only going to be [potentially affected by] stormwater. I didn’t get flood insurance, because it was going to cost $10,000 a year to get flood insurance. “On Sunday morning I woke up to [housemate] Michelle banging on my door, saying we have to get stuff up. I came downstairs and before I could even think about how to get stuff up, the previous owners of this place with their two little girls came down, Rog from up the road came down, and they all helped to move stuff upstairs.” Metcalfe said her neighbour’s yard went under on Saturday night. “We were watching the Hills Hoist in the neighbour’s yard, which still had clothes on it. We watched it go lower and lower as the water came up.” After evacuating on Sunday afternoon, Metcalfe stayed with her housemates, who were in the process of moving into a nearby unit they had recently bought. They and other friends and neighbours came back on Tuesday morning to broom out the remaining water and clean down the walls. “I didn’t sleep much Sunday night or Monday,” she said. A few blocks away in West End, several large apartment buildings were flooded in, water blocking entry and exit. Michael Raj watched on Tuesday as workers pumped water from the basement floors of his building. He said he had likely lost some items that were stored there. “We live just up on the third floor and we were able to stay there as it came in. We didn’t try to come down or anything, figured it was safe to be up there. But absolutely, we didn’t expect it.” In other parts of the city, as the clean-up continues, masses of hard rubbish are accumulating on footpaths. Almost 40,000 properties were without power on Tuesday morning. Most schools in southeast Queensland will reopen on Wednesday. Hundreds of roads remain cut by flood waters. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This event, in most instances, is bigger than ex-tropical cyclone Oswald and ex-tropical cyclone Debbie, it’s bigger than 1974 [floods] in terms of the rain event,” the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Tuesday. “And honestly, I don’t think anyone was ever expecting that we get this on the top of a two-year pandemic.” Palaszczuk said the Brisbane River would remain at an elevated level for the next three to four days as water was released from Wivenhoe Dam to ensure flood mitigation capacity remained in place. The Bureau of Meteorology says a possible severe thunderstorm could hit Brisbane on Thursday afternoon, bringing damaging winds and localised heavy rainfall, which may lead to flash flooding.",News/Australia news,Brisbane flood: residents assess damage to homes as clean-up efforts begin,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/brisbane-flood-residents-assess-damage-to-homes-as-clean-up-efforts-begin
3/1/2022,"The AFLW star Sarah Perkins has received widespread support after she hit back at online trolls who body-shamed her in the wake of the Gold Coast Suns’ defeat to St Kilda at the weekend. Perkins had already kicked a goal and two behinds in Sunday’s match, and taken four marks before she took a fifth in front of goal with a minute left in the game and her side four points behind. But the key forward, usually known for her keen eye for goal, skewed her shot wide and the Suns dropped to a narrow 5.4 (34) to 4.7 (31) defeat – their fourth loss of the season so far. On Monday, Perkins took to her social media to apologise to Suns fans, prompting an outpouring of support for the 28-year-old. “Yesterday hurt a lot but the sun came up this morning and I’m ready for a big week on the track and in front of goals,” she said. “Sorry to the Gold Coast Suns fans but please stick with us.” But there were also some accounts that responded with body-shaming messages and comments about her weight, which Perkins promptly called out. Perkins tweeted: “2 from 2 this evening … anyone other bloke/fake account wanna comment on my size, body shape, athleticism? More than happy to hear feedback about my football skill/ability but unfortunately not everyone can be a size 6!” 2 from 2 this evening… anyone other bloke/fake account wanna comment on my size, body shape, athleticism?More then happy to hear feedback about my football skill/ability but unfortunately not everyone can be a size 6! @Steph_Chiocci ❤️🤝 pic.twitter.com/LyQKfEeWXs The Collingwood captain Steph Chioci was one of several high-profile sportswomen who jumped to Perkins’ defence, tweeting: “People are just jealous they have never achieved anything worth posting about. Got your back always. Can’t wait to see you kick more snags from 50m out and lay tackles like a boss.” The former cricketer Alex Blackwell and recently retired netball star Caitlin Bassett also tweeted messages of support for Perkins, while the AFL’s social and inclusion policy chief, Tanya Hosch, shared a video of last week’s 55-metre goal of the year nominee against the Bulldogs and said Perkins had been instrumental in making the AFLW “great right from the start”. Perkins, who spent three years in the AFLW with Adelaide and Melbourne before moving to the Gold Coast last year, has been a fan favourite at all three clubs. She played just five matches for the Suns in 2021 before suffering a knee injury but has come back strongly this season. In response to the trolls on Monday, Perkins also posted a screenshot of one comment on her Instagram story along with the caption: “Shit like this will never get old” and two middle-finger emojis. The AFL Players Association said: “There’s no room for these kinds of comments. We’re with you all the way, Perko.” The Suns condemned the comments and said the club had reported the social media users and their comments to the relevant organisation. “There is no place for abuse of any form in our game, whether it be in the stands or on social media,” a club spokesperson said. “As a club and community … it’s up to us to call out anti-social behaviour when it occurs.”",Sport/Sport,‘Not everyone is size 6’: AFLW star Sarah Perkins hits back at online body-shamers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/01/not-everyone-is-size-6-aflw-star-sarah-perkins-hits-back-at-online-body-shamers
