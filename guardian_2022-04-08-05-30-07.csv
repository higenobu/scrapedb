4/8/2022,"Politicians and activists kept coming back to one word on Thursday after the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court: joy. After two grim years of a deadly pandemic and a democracy in peril, Jackson’s ascent as the first Black woman to serve on the nation’s highest court was lauded as a much-needed ray of hope. “Judge Jackson’s confirmation was a historic moment for our nation,” tweeted Joe Biden, posting a photo of himself with Jackson after they watched the Senate’s 53-47 bipartisan vote on TV. “We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her.” Democratic senators stood and applauded in celebration. Cory Booker, a member of the Senate judiciary committee who is African American, said in a statement: “Like many Americans, I feel immense pride and so much joy at this historic occasion. “As Judge Jackson ascends to the United States supreme court, I see in her the affirmation of our ancestors who suffered the indignities of this country yet sacrificed to bend the moral arc of our nation towards justice. They knew that America, though haunted by its past failings, was not bound by them and believed that a day like this would eventually arrive.” The sentiment was echoed by Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She said: “This is truly a joyful day for the country. Judge Jackson is one of the most experienced nominees in decades.” Jayapal acknowledged the partisan attacks by Republicans during Jackson’s confirmation process, including misleading questions about her sentencing of child abuse images offenders and views on critical race theory. “The country saw her poise, grace, thoughtfulness, and brilliance as she handled every part of the confirmation process – including some outrageous attacks from Republican senators that damaged only their credibility, not hers,” she added. Jackson’s status as the first African American female justice in the 233-year history of the supreme court was also hailed by civil rights organisations, which pointed to its symbolic power for future generations of Black girls who will see her in school textbooks. Janette McCarthy Wallace, general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said: “Today, Black women truly are supreme. Over the past few weeks, it has been an incredible privilege to bear witness to the rise of the first Black woman supreme court justice. “The significance of this moment for the Black community, especially for Black women like me who have spent decades in the legal profession, is tough to overstate.” Wallace added: “Representation is powerful – now, Black women and girls who dream of reaching the highest levels of our government can see that it is possible. While soon-to-be Justice Jackson’s confirmation did not come without racist, misogynistic attacks on her career and character, it is without question that Ketanji Brown Jackson is eminently qualified to serve on the supreme court of the United States.” Amanda Brown Lierman, executive director of Supermajority, a women’s equality organisation, added: “This is a historic moment for all women, but especially for women of color. Representation matters, and little Black girls everywhere will finally be able to see themselves represented on the highest court of the land. “I could not be more proud to have Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on the bench. I will be celebrating her with my three daughters today, and every April 7 will be Ketanji Brown Jackson day in our house.” Republicans were unrepentant about their opposition to Jackson. Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican national committee, said: “Biden’s pick Ketanji Brown Jackson is a radical, activist judge, one who failed to answer simple questions on her record, including leniency for child porn offenders and support of CRT. “Jackson has proved to be in lockstep with the far left’s political agenda, even refusing to define what a woman is.” But the vote represents a rare victory for progressives after years of setbacks and bitterly divisive hearings that saw conservatives on the court gain a 6-3 majority that will remain unchanged. Barack Obama, America’s first Black president, tweeted congratulations to Jackson and wrote: “This is a great day for America, and a proud moment in our history.” Meagan Hatcher-Mays, director of democracy policy for the grassroots movement Indivisible, said: “It’s not often we can describe a Senate vote as ‘joyous’, but that’s exactly what this was – for the first time in the supreme court’s 233-year history, a Black woman will serve as a justice.”",News/US news,‘So much joy’: Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation lauded as ray of hope,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/ketanj-brown-jackson-confirmation-vote-supreme-court

4/8/2022,"Northern Territory police officer Zachary Rolfe spoke repeatedly about how he could take a paid holiday if he shot someone while on duty, his former fiancee told detectives, according to a transcript of a police interview and a statement released by the NT supreme court. In the wide-ranging interview the woman also said Rolfe told her at different times that he was the first to get his gun out on jobs, and did not turn on his body-worn camera as he did not want people at the police station to see what he was doing. In response to questions from the Guardian, Rolfe has strongly denied making any of the comments, and questioned why his former fiancee, who was also a police officer, did not mention them to her superiors or colleagues at the time. The NT supreme court has released a transcript of the woman’s interview and statement following Rolfe’s acquittal in March on charges of murder and two alternative charges regarding the death of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi Walker. Walker had been shot three times by Rolfe during an arrest in the remote community of Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs, in November 2019. Rolfe argued at trial that he shot Walker in defence of himself and a colleague after Walker stabbed him with scissors and struggled with another officer. Guardian Australia does not suggest that the matters raised in the interview and the statement had any bearing on Rolfe’s actions in respect of the death of Kumanjayi Walker or his acquittal by a jury in the subsequent criminal trial. However, as remarks alleged to have been made by a serving police officer, and included in documents put before the court, the Guardian considers there is a public interest in reporting the claims. The woman, who Guardian Australia has chosen not to name, said she started her relationship with Rolfe in early 2018 when the pair both worked at Alice Springs police station. They became engaged within weeks, before Rolfe broke up with her later that year. She said she left the force soon after the separation, and had not spoken to Rolfe for almost a year before the shooting. In August 2020, Det Sen Sgt Kirk Pennuto and Det Sgt Wayne Newell, the officers investigating Walker’s death, interviewed the 26-year-old woman for almost two-and-a-half hours. A year later, in September 2021, the woman made a further brief statement clarifying information she had previously provided. The 92-page transcript of the August interview, along with the later statement, was included in a bundle of material tendered by the prosecution in a pre-trial application to determine what was admissible in Rolfe’s trial. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In that application, the prosecution relied on limited sections of the transcript and statement, largely concerning what Rolfe had allegedly said regarding a previous arrest. The remainder of the transcript, including the alleged statements in this story, was not raised and was not the subject of submissions. Rolfe’s defence team successfully argued none of the material was admissible as evidence, in part because no findings of wrongdoing had been made against Rolfe. Justice John Burns ultimately found that including the material would not help a jury determine whether Rolfe was guilty of the murder of Walker. “Nothing in the evidence of the tendency incidents could … assist the jury in understanding or inferring the accused’s state of mind of the charged events,” Justice Burns said in a January 2022 decision. As a result, evidence about the matters in the transcript was not presented at trial and Rolfe did not have an opportunity to answer it. The interview contains details about how Rolfe’s former fiancee viewed his relationships with policing, the army, and his colleagues. While much of it details her impressions and opinions, it also includes her account of several statements she alleges Rolfe made to her. “Zach said on several occasions to me … that he would like to shoot someone so then he can go on a paid holiday,” she said in the interview. In her later statement, she said Rolfe said words to the effect of “if I shot someone I could go on a six-month holiday”. She said in the police interview: “Because obviously when you shoot someone you go under investigation, like what is happening now, and you go on a paid holiday. “I don’t think he really understood the ramifications of if that ever actually did happen or would happen. And then it did happen. And I couldn’t imagine he’s in a good position now.” Asked later in the interview whether she took Rolfe to be serious she said: “Mm yeah. Because he said it so many times. I think he really did – I think everything is said in like, said in jest is like, oh, it would be a paid holiday, but then when it really happens, is it really a fun paid holiday, like is it really not that serious?” Asked again whether the comments were made flippantly she said “I think some were considered and some were flippant. ’Cause you have to consider something to say something on several occasions.” She said she believed Rolfe had made similar comments on “maybe” five occasions, and that she had responded that it would not be a “fun holiday at all”. In her later statement, she said this occurred when they were talking about going on a holiday and Rolfe would say it off the cuff. It happened several times during conversations at the home they shared in Alice Springs, she said. In a statement to the Guardian, Rolfe strongly denied making any of the alleged comments in this story. He did not respond to individual questions, but raised the fact his ex-fiancee had not reported those comments at the time. “I strongly deny making any of these alleged comments. During our relationship, despite the seriousness of her allegations, she never mentioned them to her superiors or fellow police officers. “Despite me being such an apparently bad guy, [she] stayed with me until I broke off the relationship with her in 2018 and was devastated when I did so.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app When asked by Pennuto during her interview why she had not “done anything” with the comments she said Rolfe made to her about a paid holiday, the former fiancee responded: “I don’t know … I loved him at the time and I just – I would say to him, ‘you don’t want to go on that kind of holiday, it’s not a holiday, it’s serious,’ and then he would just like kind of laugh it off. “So I think I, in myself, tried to tell myself that it was – it wasn’t real, like he didn’t actually mean that sort of thing. But there’s no other reason, like I can’t think of why I didn’t tell anyone.” Rolfe and the woman met in late 2017 and were engaged in March 2018, she told police. They separated about six months later. She said they had been planning a wedding before he broke up with her. Pennuto and Newell asked the woman extensive questions about Rolfe’s conduct as a police officer. The woman also told police during her interview that Rolfe had said to her – she believed when he was teaching her to shoot at a range – that he would always be the first person to get his gun out if required on a job. She said in her later signed statement that Rolfe had said to her at the home they shared “I always get my gun out first”, and that he had thought it was funny in the context he was saying it. He also told her, she said, that he did not turn on his body-worn camera, because he did not want people at the station to see what he had been doing. Rolfe’s camera was on during the shooting of Walker, and throughout his time in Yuendumu, with portions of the footage played during his trial. Rolfe’s former fiancee also told police that the “awful” and “terrible” culture at Alice Springs police station generally of “bitching” behind people’s backs was so bad that she ended up leaving the force. In December last year, the prosecution in Rolfe’s murder case made an unsuccessful application to include material relating to his alleged history in policing, known as tendency evidence, in his trial. The prosecution sought to include evidence regarding four incidents in which they alleged Rolfe may have improperly used force while he was involved in an arrest. But his lawyers argued in a pre-trial hearing that on all four occasions Rolfe had been cleared of using inappropriate force, and there had not been any finding of wrongdoing against him during his career. Justice Burns said during the hearing that the prosecution appeared to have “cherrypicked” four arrests from potentially hundreds of others in which Rolfe had been involved without incident. Most of the former fiancee’s interview and statement was not referred to in this application, but her claims relating to the arrest of a man called Malcolm Ryder were referred to by the prosecution as something they would seek to rely on to establish what they alleged was a pattern of behaviour by Rolfe. She said in her interview that Rolfe told her he had asked a colleague at Alice Springs police station to scratch his face after he arrested Ryder in 2018. She said Rolfe wanted to make it appear that Ryder had scratched him during the arrest to justify his use of force. She and Rolfe were not dating at the time of the Ryder incident and she said in her statement that Rolfe told her this later. Ryder was cleared of charges of assaulting police. The fiancee’s claims did not form part of that trial. Rolfe’s lawyer, Luke Officer, said in a statement to the Guardian that it was important to note that so little of the former fiancee’s interview was used in the prosecution’s application. He said the portions referred to in this article were not raised in the application and the transcript and allegations in it were not raised at trial. “If you chose to publish certain extracts of the transcript that were not relied upon by the prosecution and rejected by the trial judge in a failed application to introduce tendency evidence then in our view that is not fair, accurate and balanced.” The transcript of the interview and other materials were released to the media just over two weeks ago after the Guardian and other outlets successfully argued for the lifting of about 20 suppression orders on the case. The woman also gave a second interview to police, but the transcript of this interview was not included in the prosecution’s evidence. During the court hearing determining whether the orders should be lifted, David Edwardson, QC for Rolfe, argued that the tendency evidence was “misconceived” and that suppression orders regarding it should therefore remain in place. He said the tendency material was “no more than an argument that was advanced by the prosecution, unsuccessfully, as to conduct imputed against Mr Rolfe”. “It was inadmissible. It’s unsubstantiated. And there is no public interest, in my submission, in it being put out into the ether, so to speak. “So that’s the basis upon which we maintain our objection.” But Justice Burns said the public interest in open justice and scrutiny of the court’s decisions outweighed any potential damage to Rolfe’s reputation. “Whichever way one looks at the matter, while there may be some embarrassment and potentially some damage to the reputation of Mr Rolfe if the material which is the subject of the suppression orders is published, that is of lesser importance … than ensuring that the public has the means of scrutinising the decisions which have been made by this court and of understanding the decisions that the court has made,” he said. “In my view, it is in the public interest that the decisions made by the court surrounding the evidence which the Crown sought to lead at trial and which was rejected be subject to open scrutiny. “This is particularly so in a case where there are post-trial claims made of interference in the charging process.” Michael Riches, the NT independent commissioner against corruption, announced on 29 March that he was investigating “allegations of improper conduct relating to the arrest and charge” of Rolfe in relation to Walker’s death. The NT police have said they will fully cooperate with the investigation.",News/Australia news,"Zachary Rolfe’s ex-fiancee told detectives he spoke of getting paid holiday if he shot someone, court documents show",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/zachary-rolfes-ex-fiancee-told-detectives-he-spoke-of-getting-paid-holiday-if-he-shot-someone-court-documents-show
4/8/2022,"Emails have been released that appear to show the state of Abu Dhabi facilitating payments to Manchester City, reigniting the controversy that led to the club receiving a ban from European competition that was ultimately overturned at the court of arbitration for sport. According to documents published by Der Spiegel, City liaised with a government agency in the Gulf State to fulfil payments to the club owed by a private company under the control of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family and City’s owner since 2008. It comes alongside further claims that the Premier League is investigating the possibility City paid transfer fees for underage players and supplemented the wages of their former manager, Roberto Mancini, by means of a secret consultancy contract. City would not comment on the allegations but sources close to the club said the new reports were a continuation of an “orchestrated campaign” and part of “an endless attempt to damage us”. Previous allegations made by Der Spiegel which suggested City were the beneficiaries of inflated sponsorship deals directly funded by Sheikh Mansour led to the club receiving a two-year ban from the Champions League. That ban was subsequently cancelled on appeal by Cas. The new reports are based in part on a further tranche of documents released by the Football Leaks group. They show a number of communications between Simon Pearce, a member of the City board and vice-chairman of sister club Melbourne City FC, and Omar Awad, the finance director of the Executive Affairs Authority, an Abu Dhabi government agency. In one email from 2013, Pearce is shown to ask Awad to forward a payment of £31.7m to City from a bank account belonging to the Abu Dhabi Investment and Development Group (ADUG). This is a fund owned by Sheikh Mansour but which UAE officials have consistently said is a private fund and unconnected to the state. Further club communications published by Der Spiegel but previously reported on by Reuters show Pearce communicating from an EEA.gov.ae email address. One such mail is sent to Pearce from City’s then head of finance Andrew Widdowson on 7 December 2012 and asks for Pearce to “help in facilitating the amounts due via the Abu Dhabi partners”. Widdowson then goes on to specify sums of money to be directed through sponsors Etihad and Etisalat, two Abu Dhabi businesses. “I want to ensure that they come through the correct channels and are not picked up as separate sources of funding,” Widdowson writes. Der Spiegel also reports that the Premier League is continuing to investigate City after nearly three years, in what the magazine claims is a three-pronged pursuit. Alongside questions over the involvement of the Abu Dhabi state in making payments to City, the Premier League are also reported to be looking into claims City recruited the then 14-year-old player Brahim Díaz, contrary to Fifa’s rules over the movement of minors. Der Spiegel claims that ADUG also paid €360,000 in compensation to Díaz’s youth team, indirectly via Spanish intermediaries. The Premier League are further reported to be investigating claims that were also part of the Football Leaks files, which appear to show that former manager Mancini both received a salary from City and a larger annual “consultancy” fee from Al Jazira Club, a group controlled by Sheikh Mansour. The supplementary fee was allegedly devised in order to circumvent Uefa’s Financial Fair Play rules. The Premier League would not comment on the Der Spiegel allegations, nor the investigation into City which was confirmed as ongoing in a ruling by the court of appeal last year. In a statement released in 2019, the Premier League said it would not comment on the investigation further.",Sport/Football,Leaked emails reveal Manchester City received payments from Abu Dhabi,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/leaked-emails-reveal-manchester-city-received-payments-from-abu-dhabi
4/8/2022,"A former cabinet minister has challenged the Grenfell inquiry not to waste his time while giving evidence, before getting the death toll from the disaster wrong. Lord Pickles, who served as secretary of state at the then Department for Communities and Local Government between 2010 and 2015, sparked anger after he advised the inquiry’s senior counsel to “use your time wisely” as he had an extremely busy day. Pickles said: “By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like, but could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in.” The first report from the Grenfell inquiry found that lessons from the 2006 Lakanal House tower block fire had not been learned by the time of the Grenfell disaster. In response to this, Pickles said that he had come to the view that a swifter response to the coroner’s recommendations in 2013 would not “have made any difference whatsoever”. “This isn’t about deregulation,” he added, but the “nameless victims” and “96 people” who were killed. 72 people were killed in the Grenfell fire, all of whom have been named. The 96 figure Pickles used is the same number of people originally thought to have died in the Hillsborough disaster. The inquiry’s chief counsel, Richard Millett QC, said: “You were spectacularly out of touch with what was happening in your department.” Pickles responded that it was “uncharacteristically unjust” for counsel to say that, and that his was an “enormous department”. Millett said: “Your department was always subject to the deregulatory agenda and you are now seeking to recast that narrative and to underplay what was in truth an enthusiasm by your government for a deregulatory agenda, which led to a complete absence of proper checks and balances so far as concerns life safety.” Pickles replied: “I think that would be unkind.” At the end of the hearing, the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, thanked him for his time, saying: “I am sorry that it interfered with your arrangements for today, but there were things that we needed to ask you.” The survivors’ group Grenfell United criticised Pickles for what it called his “utter disregard” for victims and called for his removal from government and the House of Lords. “His utter disregard for what happened and to those no longer with us is horrifying, given that he had the ability as minister of housing to reform building safety,” they said. “Eric Pickles must be removed from government and the Lords. Otherwise, government continues to show the contempt it’s always had for people’s safety in this country.” Yesterday several UK housebuilders signed a government-led pledge to fix fire safety problems in apartment blocks built since 1992. The new Building Safety Pledge commits developers to remove unsafe cladding and address fire-safety issues on all buildings of 11 metres tall or higher which were developed in the last 30 years, and not to claim any funds from the government’s Building Safety Fund.",News/UK news,Eric Pickles asks Grenfell inquiry not to waste his time but gets death toll wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/07/eric-pickles-asks-grenfell-inquiry-not-to-waste-his-time-but-gets-death-toll-wrong
