4/19/2022,"Achoir of joyful, experimental, virtuosic Black female voices greets visitors to the British pavilion at the 59th Venice Biennale, the world’s most prominent international art event – delayed a year by the Covid pandemic. Sonia Boyce, 60, the artist who is representing Britain at the Biennale, invited four Black singers of different generations – jazz singer Jacqui Dankworth, singer-songwriter Tanita Tikaram, blues-influenced artist Poppy Ajudha and experimental vocalist Sofia Jernberg – to improvise, at first together under the direction of the composer Errollyn Wallen, then alone. The resulting videos of the singers play out in an immersive, bright environment full of colourful “wallpaper” and golden embellishment. Boyce also shows items from her Devotional project, an ever-expanding archive begun in 1999, of vinyl, CDs and memorabilia of an often hidden history of Black female musicianship. It is, she said, “a collective attempt against amnesia”. As is characteristic for Boyce, who often collaborates with others, she did not direct or instruct the musicians or her film crew after she brought them together. Rather, during the day-long session at Abbey Road Studios, she allowed them to “play”. “One of my most abiding memories of the day was watching Tanita Tikaram improvising five different songs on the spot,” said the artist. For me that is the answer to why the Devotional project might be important. There is all this incredible, skilful knowledge in these performers who, by being reduced to being ‘female’ or ‘Black’ – if we only focus on that – we can miss what they can do. Even when we are actually surrounded by it.” It is a statement that might be a warning to remember that Boyce, whose long career began when she was associated with the Blk Art Group in the early 1980s, is not to be reduced to being the first Black woman to occupy the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale – or to being the first Black British woman elected a Royal Academician, or to being the first Black British woman to have a painting collected by Tate, in 1987. Nevertheless occupying a national pavilion, at an art event that is unusually embroiled in the geopolitics of the moment – playing out as it does in pavilions devoted to individual countries – is an unusually freighted experience for any artist. Just down the wide avenue from the British pavilion in Venice’s Giardini, one of the two main venues for the Biennale, is the Russian pavilion. The Lithuanian curator of Russia’s project, as well as its artists, resigned shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the art nouveau Russian pavilion is lying empty, conspicuously patrolled on Tuesday morning by an armed guard. Like embassies, each national pavilion is officially the property of its own country. By contrast, the Ukrainian pavilion, featuring artist Pavlo Makov – who managed to make it out of Kharkiv and to Venice along with his team – will be very much present, with all eyes too on a last-minute exhibition in the Giardini, titled Piazza Ucraina and staged in solidarity with the country. On what she referred to as “the burden of representation” in her occupation of the British pavilion this year, Boyce said, “I cannot represent all the Black artists in Britain, and all the female artists, and I wouldn’t want even to suggest I was doing that.” She added, “I was born in London in 1962 and lived all my life in the UK, and I am artist. That says it all … This is not a flag-waving scenario. Most artists see this as an opportunity to be part of a global dialogue with a lot of joyous and global conversations taking place.” Aside from 80 national pavilions, each Biennale, which runs from Saturday until 27 November, features a large central exhibition organised by an invited curator, this year Cecilia Alemani, chief curator of New York’s High Line. Occupying the large International pavilion in the Giardini, and the huge acreage of the city’s former naval Arsenale, Alemani’s show is titled The Milk of Dreams, after a children’s story by the British surrealist artist and author Leonora Carrington. Of the 213 artists from 58 countries in Alemani’s exhibition, most of them, for the first time in the Biennale’s history, are women. Alemani was, she said, aiming to de-centre the post-Renaissance idea of the male human as the dominant artistic viewpoint. Indeed, in the International pavilion work only by women, as well as by a scattering of non-binary and trans artists, is on show. Full of metamorphosing bodies, animals and technological fantasies, the exhibition begins with German artist Katharina Fritsch’s hyperreal sculpture of an elephant atop a pedestal and – a last-minute inclusion – a gouache of fantastical creature by the 20th century Ukrainian artist Maria Prymachenko, a museum of whose work was bombarded in February. With a wide range of new and contemporary work, including an entire room of paintings by Paula Rego, a Covid “diary” in drawings on the back of medicine packets by Sudanese-born Ibrahim El-Salahi, and a beautiful, disturbing film work by British-born artist P Staff, Alemani’s exhibition also contains “time capsules” of work by historical artists, with an emphasis on female surrealists such as Ithell Colquhoun and Dorothea Tanning. The Venice Biennale was founded in 1895 as a single international art exhibition in the Giardini. In the years that followed, national pavilions were erected in the gardens to showcase art from different countries. Always highly politicised, the Biennale was the scene of a meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in 1934. The Russian pavilion was built in 1914 by Alexey Shchusev, a great survivor who later designed Lenin’s mausoleum.",Arts/Art and design,Venice Biennale kicks off with joy and colour amid global tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/19/venice-biennale-kicks-off-with-joy-and-colour-amid-global-tensions
4/19/2022,"MPs will vote on Thursday on whether to refer Boris Johnson for a formal parliamentary investigation into whether he misled them about his knowledge of Covid law-breaking parties. Lindsay Hoyle, the House of Commons Speaker, granted a request by Labour for the matter to be examined given the prime minister insisted repeatedly that no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown, but was later issued with a fine by police for attending a birthday party. The ministerial code, which bears Johnson’s signature, says the punishment for misleading parliament is resignation. But since the prime minister is the only person who can enforce the code and he has resisted calls to stand down, the fresh investigation would pile further pressure on him. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had requested for Hoyle to grant a debate and vote on referring the row to the privileges committee, a cross-party group of seven MPs with a Conservative majority but chaired by the Labour MP Chris Bryant. Hoyle said: “It is not for me to determine whether or not the prime minister has committed a contempt. My role is to decide if there is an arguable case to be examined. “Having considered the issue, having taken advice from the clerks of the house, I’ve decided that this is a matter that I should allow the precedence accorded to the issue of privilege.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will table a motion on Wednesday to be discussed and voted on the following day, which will call for the privileges committee to look into whether the prime minister misled parliament. Johnson is meant to be on a trip to India, so will miss the vote and avoid having to defend himself in the chamber. Downing Street and the Conservative whips’ office may heavily whip their MPs to oppose the move, telling them it will be treated like a confidence vote in Johnson and that any rebels will be thrown out of the parliamentary party. But being forced to show their hand will place those Conservative backbenchers who have so far remained silent about their position on Johnson’s law-breaking in a difficult position. Opposition parties have already begun crafting digital adverts targeting constituents whose Tory MPs will vote against the motion, to hammer them in the runup to next month’s local elections. Tory MPs were urged by the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, to “do their patriotic duty” and kick Johnson out of Downing Street. He said: “The British public have declared Boris Johnson a liar. Now it’s time for parliament to do the same. The country cannot afford a prime minister who breaks the law and lies about it, especially when families are facing a cost of living crisis. “Johnson has taken the British people for fools for far too long, and it’s time for Conservative MPs to show where they stand.” In the event that MPs do vote for an investigation, the privileges committee will be able to call for papers, summon witnesses and recommend a sanction – such as suspension or expulsion.",News/Politics,Partygate: MPs to vote on whether Boris Johnson should be investigated for misleading parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/partygate-boris-johnson-mps-vote-misleading-parliament
4/19/2022,"There have been few racehorse owners in recent decades who showed as much loyalty to their trainers as the late Sheikh Hamdan al-Maktoum, who died in March 2021. From his earliest days in the sport in the 1980s, being chosen to train for the Sheikh’s Shadwell Stud operation was pretty much a guarantee that more – often many more – impeccably bred horses would follow. While Sheikh Mohammed, his younger brother, famously sent a fleet of horse boxes to remove his entire string from Henry Cecil’s stable one morning, Sheikh Hamdan was characterised by his decision to buy a yard in Lambourn for Dick Hern in the mid-80s, after he was forced to quit the Queen’s stables at West Ilsley. So it came as a bit of a jolt to hear confirmation over the weekend that several high-profile and very successful trainers have been cut from the Shadwell list, following a decision by Sheikha Hissa, the late owner’s daughter, to slim down the operation. Sir Michael Stoute, 10 times champion trainer, will no longer have any horses to run in the famous blue and white silks. Mark and Charlie Johnston, Ed Dunlop and Brian Meehan have also been dropped from the roster, along with Dermot Weld and Freddy Head in Ireland and France respectively. The colours which were carried with such distinction by horses like Nashwan, Salsabil, Dayjur, Battaash and Taghrooda are not about to disappear from our tracks overnight, but a fresh direction of travel has been set. Shadwell announced plans to sell a “substantial” number of horses last September and while there were 630 runners in the blue and white in Britain in 2021, the total seems certain to fall well short of that this year. Shadwell was also conspicuously absent from the high-profile Book 1 Sale at Tattersalls last year, at the end of a campaign on the track when their total number of runs from juveniles was below 200 for the first time in a decade, and the final tally of 160 was a drop of 38 from the number for 2012. There is an inescapable sense here of gradual decline: carefully managed, perhaps, but decline all the same. And it is also impossible to ignore the fact that a significant number of the individuals whose colours have defined Flat racing for the last 40 years are now in their 70s, at least. The silks of the leading owners are racing’s version of radio-carbon dating. Long-standing fans of the Flat could probably look through the colours on the runners in any Derby in the last half-century and guess, to within a year or two, when it was run. From the early 70s onwards, traditional owner-breeders like Lord Howard de Walden and Lord Weinstock were replaced by Robert Sangster, the Aga Khan, Sheikh Hamdan, Khalid Abdullah and Fahd Salman. They all left their mark before the various silks of the Coolmore syndicate and then the royal blue of Godolphin started to dominate the fields. But it could all change again in 10, or even five, years’ time, when the process of colouring-in a new era on the turf may be well under way. What that might mean for the sport as a whole remains to be seen, but we can only hope that the big names dropped from the Shadwell roster this season are not a straw in the wind.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Shadwell shrinkage suggests racing entering a new era,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/19/talking-horses-shadwell-shrinkage-suggests-horse-racing-entering-a-new-era
4/19/2022,"The supreme court has allowed the US Department of Defense to take disciplinary action against an air force lieutenant colonel who refuses to get a Covid-19 vaccine. In a brief, two-sentence ruling on Monday, a majority of the court sided with the Pentagon. Three justices in the conservative majority – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch – dissented. The ruling was merely the court’s latest on challenges to Covid-19 vaccine mandates. In January, the court blocked a Biden administration requirement that employees of large businesses be vaccinated and wear masks on the job. The court ruled in March that the US navy had the authority to determine the job assignments of 35 service members who refused to get vaccinated. The case in question on Monday involved Lt Col Jonathan Dunn, previously commander of a 40-member squadron in California, according to court documents filed by the US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar. Prelogar argued that while Dunn cited religious grounds for his refusal to get vaccinated, he did not “assert that the Covid-19 vaccine or compulsory vaccination in general is inconsistent with his Christian faith”, noting that he has received other vaccinations without objection. Dunn instead cited a speech given by Joe Biden that led him to conclude that “the vaccine ceased to be merely a medical invention and took on a symbolic and even sacramental quality”. His religion, he said, forbade him from participating in such “religious ritual”. Upon denial of his exemption request, Dunn sent to a major general “a one-word memorandum that simply read: ‘NUTS!’”. Prelogar noted that while Dunn maintains he meant no disrespect, “NUTS!” has a “well-known ‘military historical connotation’”. She cited the case of Anthony McAuliffe, a key US military officer in the second world war who responded to a German message requesting American surrender with the one-worded answer. The American officer who delivered McAuliffe’s message to German officers clarified that, “If you don’t understand what ‘nuts’ means, in plain English, it is the same as ‘Go to hell.’” The court documents say that the air force took disciplinary action against Dunn, including his removal from command and non-punitive disciplinary measures, citing his commanding officer who said he had “lost trust in [Dunn’s] leadership and judgment” due to the memorandum and that he displayed a “pattern of a lack of respect for military authority”. Prelogar said that Dunn’s actions independent of his refusal to be vaccinated warranted the measures against him. The US solicitor general also said that Dunn’s unit has to be ready to be deployed anywhere in the world with as little as three days’ notice, including countries that require proof of vaccination for entry. Prelogar also noted that the military has a long history of requiring vaccinations and currently requires nine vaccinations for service members. The deadline for air force members to get vaccinated was 2 November. In December, an air force spokesperson told NBC News that the military branch discharged 27 active-duty members who refused to get the vaccination and were not exempted. The US military that same month said 97% of its service members had received the Covid-19 vaccine.",News/Law,US supreme court rules against air force officer who refused Covid vaccine ,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/19/us-supreme-court-air-force-officer-covid-vaccine
4/19/2022,"Until I reached 16, I’d spent my entire education in mixed schools. A lot of that time was happy: I made friends, learned new skills and explored subjects that intrigued me. But all of those experiences happened under a shadow of misogyny – one that was fuelled by a culture of unwanted sexual advances, rape jokes and crude comments about the appearance of female teachers and fellow students that was allowed to exist in classrooms, completely unchecked by staff. I remember one geography class, where a young trainee was observing our lesson. As she walked around the room looking at everyone’s work, a group of boys waited until she was out of earshot to snigger about her behind. “Yeah, she’s got a phat back, you know,” they laughed. Teachers are naturally in a position of authority, leadership and safeguarding. But when boys began to objectify and sexualise teachers – not only elbow-nudging, gesturing and giggling behind their backs but approaching teachers to ask things like “Are you single, miss?” before running off – it felt like the boys had the power rather than the teachers. The very people who were there to protect us were no longer safe themselves. Slowly, it became apparent to me that the things I was witnessing on a daily basis weren’t isolated events but rather belonged to a very sinister culture. At the beginning of high school, things had been different. Everyone was new to each other, and the “banter” among the boys was mostly restricted to football and Fifa, beyond the occasional “make me a sandwich” or “kitchen slave”. However, as we got older, rape jokes began to creep into conversations and were met with peals of laughter from other boys. No class was safe. In business studies, we watched clips from The Apprentice, and each time a female contestant came on screen, boys would make phallic gestures or explicit comments. Even something as simple as an advert featuring a woman was viewed through this tainted, hypersexual lens. Eventually, my patience ran out and I asked: “Why are you so sexist?” The angry shouts of “HOW AM I SEXIST, TELL ME, HOW?” that came in response made me immediately regret my decision. I could feel the stares boring into the back of my head. And even though I knew I was in the right, I couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. Other girls who challenged their peers about victim-blaming rape survivors during consent lessons faced the same response. This left me feeling hopeless – the lessons had been introduced after a pair of boys were reported for coercing girls for nude photographs and posting them on social media. We were at the end of our GCSE course and preparing to leave school in a few weeks’ time, and yet this was how these conversations were ending – with fury, disagreement and two boys being sent to isolation for their comments about rape. As the end of high school approached and the time to apply for colleges and sixth forms came around, I didn’t just apply for the most popular colleges – I also tried my luck at a local all-girls schools, mainly because of its formidable reputation and academic rigour. Soon after my applications, I began to receive offers, yet I remained unsure of where to go. The option of going to an all-girls school felt like the safest one, but not a single one of my friends had applied there, so I would be starting off very much alone. However, near the end of the academic year, when the fallout of Sarah Everard’s murder and the tsunami of testimonies flooding into the Everyone’s Invited website hit the news, my decision to go to an all-girls school was cemented. Realising that rape culture wasn’t just limited to my school but applied to schools and educational institutions all over the country felt like such a blow, and one that I knew I would struggle to deal with for another two years. Now, approaching the third term of my A-levels, I feel a sense of security and safety that I haven’t had for a long time. The constant fear of being preyed upon by your classmates has disappeared – school has become a safe haven. But this shouldn’t be a choice girls are forced to make. No one should feel endangered at school in 2022.",Opinion/Opinion,I moved to an all-girls college to escape my school’s rape culture – finally I can study in safety | Anonymous,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/19/girls-college-rape-culture-teachers
4/19/2022,"Made last year but suddenly obliquely relevant after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this Estonian-British co-production examines some of the ways a repressive and homophobic state apparatus scars citizens with shame. Based on a true story according to the opening credits, the setting is the late 1970s when the Soviet Union still occupied the Baltic nations. Provincial Russian youth Sergey Serebrennikov (played by British actor Tom Prior, also one of the screenplay’s co-authors, along with Estonian director Peeter Rebane and story originator Sergey Fetisov) is doing his national service at an army base in Estonia. He has a coy flirtation going with local beauty Luisa (Diana Pozharskaya), a secretary on the base for a commanding officer, and he is pally with his bunk mate Volodja (Jake Henderson). However, when Sergey is assigned to serve as a sort of valet to suave ace fighter pilot Roman Matvajev (Ukrainian actor Oleg Zagorodnii), the attraction between the two men turns physical and they’re soon making out to Tchaikovsky records and sneaking off to Tallinn to watch a performance of Igor Stravinsky’s Firebird, hence the film’s name. Alas, this was a time when homosexuality was outlawed in the Soviet military – though the current situation is not much better – and an anonymous source tips off the local KGB officer, meaning that Sergey and Roman have to hide their love away. Sergey’s service comes to an end, and he moves to Moscow to train to become an actor, finding a more bohemian circle that lets him keep the closet door ajar if not fully open. A few years go by and in classic melodrama fashion, Roman shows up again, just unable to quit Sergey (as they say in Brokeback Mountain), even though he has married and fathered a son in the meantime. Ultimately, it’s a rather sad story, not unlike Brokeback given the period setting and closeted-love theme. But director Rebane, though competent enough, is no Ang Lee. Prior and Zagorodnii certainly have romantic chemistry, but the dialogue is often more than a little stiff and there’s something weirdly off about movies where characters speak English with one another instead of the language the characters are supposed to be speaking in, in this case Russian. You can see why the film-makers chose to do it this way, but it makes the film feel old-fashioned and clunky. That’s a shame because the film’s exploration of love, courage and the price of speaking your truth is as timely as it’s ever been, and for Russians particularly.

4/19/2022,"Authorities in Venice are pushing ahead with a plan to charge day-trippers up to €10 (£8.30) to enter the lagoon city as they scramble to gain control of tourism after visitor numbers hit pre-pandemic levels over the Easter weekend. The booking system will begin in June with a six-month pilot before potentially taking full effect in January next year. Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, said the city was “the first in the world” to conduct “this difficult experiment”. Plans for an entrance fee have been in the pipeline since the measure was approved by the Italian government in late 2018 as a solution to mass tourism in a city which, before the coronavirus pandemic, attracted an estimated 30 million people a year. That figure was demolished by the pandemic, and although visitors have returned, the Easter weekend was the first real sign of the tourism sector bouncing back as more than 125,000 people filled Venice’s squares and alleyways. “Tourism in Venice is starting again, and is a breath of fresh air for [tourism] operators,” Brugnaro tweeted. “Today, many have understood that the booking system is the right path to take for a more balanced management of tourism.” The measure will apply to day-trippers, who will need to book ahead and pay between €3 and €10, depending on how busy the city is on the day they want to visit. “The experimental phase begins in June, when day tourists will be invited to book through a website that is being completed by the council,” Simone Venturini, Venice’s tourism councillor, told La Repubblica. “Those who book will receive incentives, such as discounts on entering museums. To determine the access fee, we will set a maximum threshold of 40,000 or 50,000 visitors a day.” People living in the Veneto region will be required to book too even though they are exempt from paying the fee, while a list of other exemptions, for example needing to come to the city for a funeral or to visit a relative, will be announced over the next few weeks. Those who stay overnight will be exempt as they already pay a tourist tax. The plan could eventually include the installation of gates at key arrival points in the city. Venice is preparing for another busy period this weekend, with the inauguration of the Biennale, the world’s oldest and largest arts festival, and a national holiday on Monday.",News/World news,Venice pushes ahead with €10 entry fee plan as tourists flock back,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/venice-day-trippers-to-be-charged-up-to-10-to-enter-city
4/19/2022,"Five weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threw the two families together, Nastya Slyvka has mastered the mysteries of Irish supermarkets, while her hosts, the Kirwans, have acquired a taste for borscht. The Kirwans were among the first in Ireland to host Ukrainian refugees in their home, an experiment thousands more Irish families are to follow, and at least in this corner of Dublin suburbia, so far so good. The tragedy unfolding 2,000 miles to the east feels ever-present but for the hosts and their guests, cohabiting under the same roof has kindled friendship and restored some faith in humanity. “The experience has been extremely positive. They’re phenomenal people,” said Jennie Kirwan, 40, seated at her kitchen table with her husband, Paul, while their daughters, Elsie, 10, and Aimee, eight, played in the living room with their new “brother”, Vlad, eight. Vlad’s mother, Slyvka, 32, is relieved their odyssey from Ukraine ended in the Kirwans’ bright, spacious south Dublin home. “They treat us very well. We are very lucky to have them.” It has become normal for the two families to converse via Microsoft Translator. Since arriving on 11 March the guests have settled into a routine. Vlad attends Rathfarnham parish national school, where Elsie and Aimee have helped him integrate. He has learned to shout “pass it” and other phrases on the football pitch. His mother makes forays to SuperValu for groceries and distracts herself from the news from home by cooking. The one thing she knew about Ireland before arriving was its creamy butter. Both families accept they will live together until it is safe for Slyvka and her son to return home – a blurry endpoint. “Having our own space for us now is not so important because they’re part of the family,” said Jennie. It is one story of thousands playing out across Ireland, not all of them happy. Approximately 23,500 Ukrainian refugees have arrived. About 15,000 have sought state-provided accommodation and ended up in reception centres, shelters, hotels and lodges of varying quality and suitability. With the government running out of emergency accommodation, and hundreds more Ukrainians arriving daily, an increasing number will be funneled to some of the 23,000 people who have volunteered to host refugees in their own homes or second properties. Vetting and inspections have slowed the process. A small number of hosts have returned their guests to reception centres after balking at the implications of sharing sofas, kitchens and bathrooms with strangers. “While it is an enormous influx, the system has coped extremely well,” said Liam O’Dwyer, the secretary general of the Irish Red Cross. “People coming in here are immediately able to access social welfare, health services, child benefit, school places etc so they are receiving the normal services and benefits of being a citizen.” O’Dwyer’s tips for hosting are ensure everyone in the household supports the idea, grant the guests privacy, and establish house rules. “Largely it works out,” he said. He opposes UK-style financial support for hosts. “When money comes into it, it’s a different class of an animal. When it’s voluntary it’s an extraordinary act of generosity and that gets a hugely positive response.” Many hosts disagree. They say financial support to cover higher bills would not taint altruism. “People aren’t doing it for the money, they’re doing it for their fellow humans, but energy costs have gone up 30%,” said Angie Gough, who hosts two Ukrainian families and helps run the site HelpingIrishHosts.com. “There is massive goodwill but this could last a year or more.” The government is considering granting financial support. Money issues aside, the Kirwans say hosting can be an enriching experience. They connected with the Slyvkas early in the conflict via Ukrainian expatriates in Ireland. Slyvka ran a small textile company with her husband, Yaroslav, in the southern city of Voznesensk. When Russian troops attacked in early March, Yaroslav drove his wife and son to the border with Moldova. He remained in Ukraine while Slyvka and Vlad trekked into Moldova, wheeling suitcases and carrying two small dogs. A week later they flew from Bucharest, Romania, to Dublin and moved into a bedroom in the Kirwan home. “My advice to other hosts is don’t overwhelm your guests at the start,” said Jennie, a school principal. “You may be desperate to bring them here or there, show them around, but all they’ll want at first is to stay put. Let them settle and decompress.” Paul detailed the Kirwans’ daily routine in a four-page document he translated into Ukrainian. Friends, relatives and local businesses sent food, clothes, toys, vouchers, cash and a bicycle. “The generosity has been insane. This puts back your faith in human nature,” said Paul. Slyvka receives approximately €200 a week (£165) in social welfare. She offered it to the Kirwans, who declined, so uses it to buy groceries. When not cooking, she insists on ironing and tidying. “The presses [cupboards] have never been so organised,” said Jennie. When the children are asleep the adults open a bottle of wine and converse via Microsoft Translator, which they consider better than Google’s version. Slyvka’s phone vibrates with endless updates from home, including missile alerts. “News, news, news,” she said. She puts on a brave face for Vlad but at times has wept and howled. There is also a sense of guilt that she is safe when so many compatriots are not. She would like to return within weeks but with Russia launching a new offensive her husband has urged her to stay put. Vlad expects to notify Father Christmas that he will be in Dublin for Christmas.",News/World news,‘They treat us very well’: Ukrainian refugees settle into Irish life,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/ukrainian-refugees-ireland-life
4/19/2022,"A group of more than 200 former senior UN officials have written to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warning him that unless he does more personally to take a lead in trying to mediate a peace in Ukraine, the UN risks not just irrelevance, but its continued existence. The former staff members, including many former UN undersecretaries, urged him to raise his profile and be prepared to take personal risks to secure peace, saying the UN is facing an existential threat due to the invasion of Ukraine by one of the five permanent members of the security council. “What we and the broader public want to see, though, is a political UN presence and public engagement, in addition to the UN’s notable humanitarian response to the Ukraine crisis,” the authors said. “We want to see a clear strategy to re-establish peace, starting with a provisional ceasefire, and the use of the UN’s capacity for good offices, mediation and conflict-resolution. That could include visits to the conflict-stricken areas, discussions with the opposing sides, even moving your own office temporarily to Europe, closer to the urgently needed negotiations and, thereby, indicating the UN’s resolve to address this major crisis head-on.” There has been concern that mediation in Ukraine has been undertaken by actors ranging from Turkey, France, Israel, and Austria. By contrast during the Cuban missile crisis in 1961, the newly appointed Burmese UN secretary general, U Thant, played a major role in de-escalating and then mediating the conflict between Russia and the US. Similarly, during the buildup to the Gulf war the UN secretary general, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, convinced the US to negotiate with Iraq. In 2013 the UN took the task of mediation so seriously that its senior envoy Sérgio Vieira de Mello was in Baghdad where he was killed in a terrorist blast at the UN headquarters. The authors of the letter include Jeffrey Feltman, UN undersecretary-general for political affairs 2012-2018; Andrew Gilmour, the former UN assistant secretary general for human rights between 2016 and 19; Franz Baumann, former UN assistant secretary general for the general assembly until 2015; Ajay Chhibber, assistant secretary general UNDP; and José Antonio Ocampo a former United Nations undersecretary general for economic and social affairs. “We have decided to raise our voice out of concern for the existential challenge that the United Nations is facing in this historic juncture,” they write. “The Russian invasion of Ukraine severely undermines the post-world war two global order. It is the pinnacle of a series of threats to humanity’s peace and security, shared prosperity and respect for human rights that the UN embodies.” Critics say Guterres has been immobilised due to the scale of the splits between the permanent members of the UN security council, as well as by votes in the general assembly that have revealed deep divisions including the expulsion of Russia from the UN human rights council. Supporters of Guterres argue he has been as clear as he can in criticising the invasion as inexcusable and deplorable without jeopardising his professional role. The authors of the letter admit they do not know if Guterres is involved in any behind-the-scenes mediation. “We know that you care deeply about ensuring a positive impact of our United Nations on humanity and the planet, which will also mark your legacy at the helm of the world body,” they write. “We therefore implore you to intensify your personal efforts, deploying all capabilities at your disposal and acting upon lessons learnt from previous conflicts, for the cessation of hostilities and conflict resolution through peaceful means. “This is the raison d’être of the United Nations, which is being tested again in this case. We are horrified at the alternative, the UN becoming increasingly irrelevant and, eventually, succumbing to the fate of its predecessor, the League of Nations, with the human losses and material destruction that went with it.”",News/World news,António Guterres urged to take lead in securing peace in Ukraine or risk future of UN,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/antonio-guterres-urged-to-take-lead-in-securing-peace-in-ukraine-or-risk-future-of-un
4/19/2022,"Just Stop Oil has said it will suspend its direct actions against fuel distribution for a week, but has told the prime minister its members will escalate their disruptive protests “if you do not fulfil your duty to the people”. For two and a half weeks, the climate activists have been targeting oil terminals and oil tankers in the Midlands and the south-east of England with blockades and mass trespass. The government and petrol retailers have attempted to downplay the scale of the disruption to fuel deliveries. But there have been widespread reports of petrol station forecourts running dry in various parts of the country. Just Stop Oil’s activists have vowed to continue their campaign until the government agrees to a ban on new oil and gas extraction projects, or until they are all jailed. A letter to Boris Johnson, read out at Downing Street on Tuesday morning by two campaign supporters, said: “The bill for oil and gas is already being paid by millions around the world, in the global south, and can now also be seen in blood and suffering in Ukraine. “The truth is that this is the price we are all going to pay for allowing the grip of oil to continue its hold on us. This cost, the horror of war in Europe, must not be used as a pretext to advance an even greater tragedy – that of continuing to invest in new fossil fuel extraction, for which there is no popular support.” The letter said they would pause their actions until 25 April – next Monday – “to give you the opportunity to make a statement on behalf of the government that it will immediately halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK. “If you do not fulfil your duty to the people we will be left with no choice but to escalate our campaign of civil resistance.” On 1 April, Just Stop Oil began its campaign with coordinated blockades targeting 10 oil terminals in Birmingham, Warwickshire, Hampshire, Essex and London. The campaign, which was supported by Extinction Rebellion, aimed to disrupt fuel deliveries, particularly to the south-east and London. Within days there were anecdotal reports of fuel shortages and while petrol retailers insisted the disruption was manageable, a source at one admitted that was only because it had been able to divert supplies from terminals farther north. Official figures later showed that in the three days after protests started, deliveries to petrol stations were down 43% in the West Midlands, 44% in London and 48% in the east. As police battled to minimise the disruption possible from blockades, the protesters shifted tactics. On 6 April they staged their first mass trespass, at the Navigator oil terminal in Grays, Essex, where activists climbed spike-topped fences and ran to a loading bay to obstruct equipment with lock-ons. Reports of petrol station shortages multiplied, given added weight by a claim by the petrol consumers group FairFuelUK – subsequently reversed – that it had “credible intelligence” that one in three pumps were running dry. Downing Street condemned the “guerrilla tactics” of protesters, while Priti Patel, the home secretary, said “people across the country [were] seeing their lives brought to a standstill” by disruption, and Labour called for “nationwide injunctions” to ban the protests. At least three oil distribution companies have obtained injunctions. Last week, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Navigator Thames, ExxonMobil and Valero were among “a number of key operators in the oil sector” that had obtained court orders to ban protests at their sites. The department also confirmed that injunctions granted to ban Insulate Britain’s protests on key roads in the south-east were still in force. Meanwhile, direct actions have continued, with Just Stop Oil saying they will not stop until the government meets their demand, or they are all jailed. Just Stop Oil said they were still collating their tally, but that the number of arrests linked to the campaign so far could be as high as 1,100. They have previously said about 400 have taken part in the campaign. On Tuesday morning, five were on remand. Two had been transferred to prison in Essex before a court appearance on charges of aggravated trespass on Wednesday. Three more were brought to London from the Midlands on Tuesday to appear at the high court on charges of breaking an injunction.",News/Environment,Just Stop Oil calls one-week halt to protests in hope of action from No 10,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/just-stop-oil-calls-one-week-halt-to-protests-in-hope-of-action-from-no-10
