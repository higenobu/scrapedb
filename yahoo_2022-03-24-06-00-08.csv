3/24/2022,"The head of Russia's Ministry of Defense Sergei Shoigu has not been seen in public for 12 days and is possibly missing, according to reports and messages circulated on Telegram on Wednesday. Investigative journalists from the Russian independent news outlets Mediazona and Agentstvo claimed on Wednesday that the normally media savvy Shoigu has not appeared in public since March 11. There are rumors that Shoigu is in poor health and is experiencing heart problems, while other messages are swirling online suggest Shoigu might have been fired from the ministry and is on house arrest, according to Russian journalists. Fox News has not yet independently verified these allegations. TOP RUSSIAN GENERAL REPORTEDLY DETAINED AS PUTIN TARGETS ‘TRAITORS’ AMID UKRAINE INVASION Shoigu was last seen in public on March 11 presenting awards to Russian troops occupying Ukraine during what Russian President Vladimir Putin dubbed a ""special military operation"" but what the West has condemned as a full-scale invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine. The Kremlin said in a statement on its website on March 18 that Shoigu was present during a meeting Putin called with members of his security council to discuss ""the progress of the special operation in Ukraine,"" but no photos or videos of the meeting were posted online. The Russian state-run Channel 1 aired a broadcast that same day, March 18, about Shoigu presenting military awards ""today"" but used an image of the ceremony that had already been posted on the Ministry of Defense’s website seven days earlier on March 11, according to Agentstvo. Russian journalist Dmitry Treschanin, of Mediazona, noted that Russian state-run news agency RIA also hasn’t reported about Shoigu since March 11. He questioned whether Shoigu was in Chernobaevka, located outside of Kherson, the first major city to be occupied by Russian forces on March 2. ""Listen, the great PR minister Shoigu has been out of public space since March 11th,"" Treschanin tweeted on Wednesday. ""ELEVEN DAYS OF WAR, we do not have the head of the Ministry of Defense."" Moscow Times reporter Jake Cordell tweeted on Wednesday about ""lots of Telegram chatter today about the whereabouts of Russia’s defense minister Sergei Shoigu,"" noting that Shoigu has not been seen with Putin since a meeting in Moscow on Feb. 27, just three days after beginning the invasion of Ukraine. It was at that meeting when Putin ordered Shoigu and the chief of the general staff of the armed forces of Russia, Valery Gerasimov, to put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. Ukrainian newspaper Pravda, citing the Russian investigative outlets, reported that Gerasimov also hasn’t made any public appearances since March 11. According to Agenstvo, Shoigu has made media appearances a priority since becoming Minister of Defense in 2012 and had appeared on television nearly every day since the start of the invasion of Ukraine up until March 11. This comes as Russian forces on the ground have stalled after suffering heavy casualties, while continuing their bombardment and air strikes targeting major population centers in Ukrainian cities. NATO said Wednesday that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine. Putin, meanwhile, has reportedly been conducting a witch hunt within his own inner circle, growing ""incandescent"" over the belief that those close to him are leaking information about his military plans to the West. Ukrainian officials have so far claimed to have killed at least five Russian generals. Foreign Policy Magazine reported that Russian generals are being forced to advanced positions on the battlefields, leaving them exposed to attack, as they struggle to get orders to disorganized conscripted troops on the front lines.",World/Fox News,"Russia’s Ministry of Defense Head Sergei Shoigu reportedly missing, hasn't made public appearances in 12 days",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ministry-defense-head-sergei-175234417.html

Per the Irish Independent, McGregor was detained after being pulled over in his Bentley Continental GT by gardaí between Lucan and Palmerstown. His vehicle, worth an estimated $187,0000, was briefly seized by police before it was returned. Gardaí, the national police in Ireland, did not name McGregor because of the country’s privacy restrictions, but they did confirm an arrest was made. “Gardaí arrested a man aged in his 30s in relation an incident of dangerous driving in the Palmerstown area yesterday evening, Tuesday 22nd March 2022,” the department told the Independent. “The man was taken to Lucan Garda Station where he was later charged. He has been released pending an appearance before Blanchardstown District Court at a later date.” If convicted, McGregor could face a fine equating to $5,502, up to six months in prison, or both.

3/24/2022,"A river basin to the northwest of Kyiv has been flooded. It's unclear whether this was intentional, but it could be a move to block Russian troops. If the troops were unable to cross the river, they wouldn't be able to capture Kyiv from the West, per CNN. Satellite images show flooding in the Irpin River basin northwest of Kyiv. It is unclear what caused the flooding, but this could be a strategic move by Ukraine to block the advance of Russian troops on the capital, analysts have said. The basin borders a large reservoir. It could be an example of ""hydraulic warfare"" from Ukraine to block the advancing Russian troops targeting the city's northwest, analysts previously told the Washington Post. If the Russian forces cannot cross the Irpin river, they will not be able to take Kyiv from the west, according to CNN. According to the UK's defense intelligence, Russian troops have driven towards Kyiv from the north, west, and east since the war began on February 24. Capturing Kyiv is seen as Russia's primary goal in its invasion of Ukraine, but it has struggled to make headway facing fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. Ukraine said Tuesday that it had recaptured Makariv, a town west of Kyiv, the Associated Press said, further blunting Russia's ambition to launch an assault on the city from the northwest. Ukraine's ambassador to the US said on February 26 that Russian forces had destroyed a dam in the water reservoir North of Kyiv. However, it is unclear whether that event is connected to the flooding, per The Washington Post.           Read the original article on Business Insider",World/Business Insider,"Satellite photos show flooding around Kyiv, protecting the capital from Russian advances in a possible instance of 'hydraulic warfare'",https://news.yahoo.com/satellite-photos-show-flooding-around-115747975.html
3/24/2022,"A pro-Kremlin tabloid claimed in an article that close to 10,000 Russian soldiers have died during the country’s invasion of Ukraine, citing Russia’s Ministry of Defense, before deleting the information and claiming they were the result of a hack. The paper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, said in an article that 9,861 Russian soldiers had died and 16,153 had been injured during the invasion, according to data from the Defense Ministry. However, the article was reposted minutes later without the paragraph providing information on casualties. The original article was captured by the Internet Archive. The paper said the information was added by a hacker in a statement released shortly after the paragraph was deleted. The article couched those figures as a response to Ukrainian officials who claimed to have inflicted crippling losses on the Russian military. Ukraine claimed on Saturday that up to 14,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in fighting, while U.S.-intelligence estimates put the number of Russian dead at around 7,000. The Russian Ministry of Defense had previously acknowledged the combat deaths of just 498 soldiers. No other outlets carried the alleged Russian Ministry of Defense figures reported by Komsomolskaya Pravda. Russia has enacted policies to censor news and social media during the war with Ukraine, including passing a law that punishes citizens convicted of spreading “false information” on the war with up to 15 years in prison. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova on March 14 held up a sign that read “Stop the war. Don’t believe propaganda. They’re lying to you,” during a live broadcast by her former employer, Russia’s Channel One. Ovsyannikova was detained and fined 30,000 rubles over a separate video but still faces potential charges under the new law, according to ABC News. While Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid March that around 1,300 Ukrainian troops had died in the fighting, the government has not disclosed official casualty numbers. Civilian casualties also continue to mount in Ukraine. Russian forces are currently besieging the southern port city of Mariupol, where Ukrainian officials say around 2,000 civilians have been killed. Russian forces targeted a shopping mall in Kyiv on Monday, with at least eight people reportedly killed in that attack, according to Sky News. Russia claimed that Ukrainian forces were using the mall to store a rocket system.

3/24/2022,"MIAMI (AP) — Former Trump adviser Paul Manafort was removed from a plane at Miami International Airport before it took off for Dubai because he carried a revoked passport, officials said Wednesday. Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta confirmed that Manafort was removed from the Emirates Airline flight without incident Sunday night but directed further questions to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That agency did not immediately respond to an email Wednesday seeking comment. A lawyer who has represented Manafort did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment Wednesday. Manafort, 72, led former President Donald Trump's campaign for several months during the 2016 presidential race but was ousted in August of that year after revelations about his business dealings in Ukraine. Former bank CEO Stephen Calk, who tried to bribe his way into a position in the Trump administration by ignoring red flags and granting Paul Manafort $16 million in loans has been sentenced to a year in prison, among other punishments. Paul Manafort remains free. He was later indicted on a broad array of financial crimes as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. He was convicted by a jury in August 2018 and later pleaded guilty in federal court in Washington. In May 2020, Manafort was released from a low-security prison where he was serving a more than seven-year federal sentence amid concerns about the coronavirus. Although Manafort had not served long enough to be eligible for release under the guidelines, the Bureau of Prisons decided to free him because of his age and health vulnerabilities, a person familiar with the matter has said. Trump pardoned Manafort in December 2020.

3/24/2022,"By accounts from western observers, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has stalled in more than one direction. Certainly, Vladimir Putin lost the information war within a week, and the Russian economy—meaning ordinary Russian citizens—will be absolutely battered by the sweeping sanctions regime imposed by nearly the entire world. In his quest to reclaim the Russian empire, Putin may well have turned his country into a hermit kingdom. One explanation for this spectacular mistake—a mistake that will cost many Ukrainian and Russian lives—is the one offered by former State Department Regional Medical Officer/Psychiatrist Kenneth Dekleva, who suggested to me that much of this is the result of a profound intelligence failure within Putin's security apparatus. Contrary to the growing conventional wisdom that Putin has gone off the rails in terms of his mental state, Dekleva holds that he's the same sicko he always was, he's just operating on particularly bad information. We may have some new evidence pointing towards that conclusion. In a video posted to YouTube on April 11, 2021, journalist and former member of the Russian parliament Aleksandr Nevzorov appears to predict the consequences of a Russian invasion of Ukraine with an eerie prescience—at least if a version with English subtitles, reposted this month, is accurate. A rudimentary auto-translation of the original video suggests it is. Nevzorov predicts the Russian military will be far less effective in practice than its reputation would suggest. He predicts Putin's military analysts will feed him fantasies about how the invasion will play out based on war games that do not reflect reality. He predicts fierce Ukrainian resistance, even fiercer than what Russia ran into in Chechnya. (His interpretation of the Chechen conflicts is also interesting: he sees the Chechens as victors.) He predicts huge troop losses for the Russians, who will make heavy use of undertrained conscripts. He predicts many of these men will have no idea why they're even fighting this war. He predicts massive external reaction, but also a growing internal opposition that will eventually unite the anti-Putin factions in an antiwar movement. He predicts the conflict will end in tragedy and humiliation for Russia, in part because he thinks both military victory and military defeat will yield an overall defeat. He even predicts Japan will grow emboldened in their dispute with Russia over the Kuril Islands. How did Nevzorov see all of this nearly a year ago, but Putin did not? It certainly suggests the boss was not sitting downstream on the right river of information.
