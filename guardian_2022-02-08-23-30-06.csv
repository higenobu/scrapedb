2/8/2022,"The NHS waiting list in England, which already stands at a record 6 million, will keep on growing for more than another two years as millions more patients seek care, Sajid Javid told MPs today. The health secretary made the admission in a Commons statement to launch the long-awaited elective recovery plan setting out the NHS’s plan to tackle the backlog of hospital treatment.  As many as 10 million people who did not seek care from the NHS since the Covid pandemic struck in March 2020 could now turn to it for help, he said. Under it, the NHS will have to ensure that by July this year no one has to wait longer than two years for planned treatment in hospital – currently, 18,600 people have been waiting that long. However, it will take until March 2025 – well past the next general election in May 2024 – to end the situation where large numbers of patients, currently 307,000, are forced to wait over a year. The publication of the plan sparked a spat between Javid and Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow health secretary. Streeting said the plan “falls seriously short of the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and the misery that is affecting millions of people, stuck on record-high NHS waiting lists”. He also criticised Javid for trying to portray the backlog as having been caused by the Covid pandemic. It was rather “a Tory backlog”, caused by years of underfunding of the NHS and failure to tackle the health service’s understaffing, he claimed.",News/Society,"England’s hospital waiting list will keep growing, says Sajid Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/08/englands-hospital-waiting-list-will-keep-growing-says-sajid-javid
2/8/2022,"Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine’s borders.  Moscow’s rhetoric has also grown more belligerent. Vladimir Putin has demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine will never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he is unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity has done little to dampen tensions. Putin is also short on time. His troops cannot remain out of garrison indefinitely. By late winter he will probably have to launch an attack or draw down his forces, in what would look like a retreat. As of 6 February, 74-76 battalion tactical groups, the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, were estimated by military intelligence group Rochan Consulting to be in place near the borders of Ukraine in both Russia and latterly Belarus. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived in spring 2021, when Russia put an estimated 110,000 troops with tanks and other heavy weaponry near the border. Some, but not all, of Russia’s troops to base in May after Putin secured a summit with Joe Biden. Russian troops have been arriving from the east for several weeks, with the total as of early February variously estimated at 127,000 and 135,000. There are also separatist forces in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. Their numbers are estimated at 32,000, some of whom are likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces. This assessment shows some of the main deployments as of late 2021: In early February, there was some evidence that forces previously massed several hundred miles from the border were moving closer to Ukraine. There were signs that the seven BTGs stations in Yelnya, near Smolensk, were moving on to near Klintsy, around 100km from the border. Over the new year Russia began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint “Allied Resolve” exercises set to take place from 10-20 February. That deployment is continuing to grow and is currently estimated at around 17 BTGs or possibly higher. Nato has warned that Russian forces in Belarus could reach 30,000, including Speznaz special operations forces, SU-35 fighter jets, S-400 air defence systems and Iskander missiles, which can carry nuclear weapons, and have a range of 500km. One of the largest forces to remain near Ukraine since May 2021 comes from the 41st Combined Arms Army, which is headquartered in Novosibirsk almost 2,000 miles away. Stationed at the Pogonovo training area south of Voronezh since spring, some of the 41st CAA forces have moved to Yelnya, a town in the Smolensk region closer to Belarus. The equipment includes motorised infantry, main battle tanks, rocket artillery and Iskander short-range ballistic missiles comprising an estimated six or seven BTGs, according to an estimate by the independent defence analyst Konrad Muzyka. Satellite images taken from above Pogonovo depict the arrival of more equipment between November 2021 and January 2022. Other recent movements show motor rifle brigades from the 49th Combined Arms Army moving towards Crimea. Artillery and air-defence assets from the 58th Combined Arms Army have also been spotted in satellite photographs taken from above Novoozerne in western Crimea. The US estimates 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. There are also units permanently deployed near Ukraine from the 8th and 20th Combined Arms Armies. A map released by Ukrainian military intelligence in November showed a worst-case scenario: Russian forces crossing the Ukrainian border from the east and attacking from annexed Crimea, as well as launching an amphibious assault on Odessa with support from Russian soldiers in Transnistria and troops sent in from Belarus. Some aspects of the plan, such as offensives from the east and through Crimea, already appear possible. Others, such as an attack from Belarus, appear to factor in troops that are only now gradually arriving in the region. The thinking in Ukraine as of late January was that a focused attack in the east was the most likely scenario. On 21 January Ukrainian military intelligence said that since the beginning of the month Moscow had supplied separatists in eastern Ukraine with additional tanks, self-propelled artillery, mortars and more than 7,000 tons of fuel. The US, the UK and some independent western experts also highlight the importance of Belarus. The country, now closely aligned to Moscow, is considered the simplest invasion route to Ukraine’s capital Kyiv as it would allow Russian forces to cross the large Dniepr river in friendly territory and attack Kyiv from the west. The potential economic consequences of any new fighting would be enormous as the US and its allies are promising “significant and severe” economic and technological sanctions in the event of an attack, while Russia could cut off gas supplies to Europe. Russia could still seek concessions from the west in negotiations while maintaining its troops along the border for a credible threat of escalation. Putin has said he believes high tensions are useful for Russia. Nevertheless, analysts say that without a clear diplomatic victory, any drawdown could look like a defeat. A potential window for any offensive in the Donbas would be at some point in February, after Putin attended the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing and meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Military exercises in Belarus are due to finish on 20 February, the most obvious moment for an offensive operation. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement, which observers say is close to collapse. Russia no longer wants to maintain the status quo and is looking for another way to assert control over Ukraine. The completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea gives both sides an economic weapon. The pipeline would allow Russia to send gas to Europe without going through Ukraine, meaning Moscow could pile pressure on Kyiv without the risk that Kyiv would cut the gas supply route in retaliation. Ukraine has lobbied furiously against the project, saying it undermines its national security. However, the pipeline, which has become a pet project of Putin’s, has not yet come online, and western governments have indicated that in the case of invasion, that may never happen.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine crisis: where are Putin’s troops and what are his options?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-ukraine-crisis-putin-troops-visual-guide-explainer
2/8/2022,"The new mayor of New York City has caused a mix of amusement and serious consternation by comparing cheese to heroin.  “Food is like a drug,” Eric Adams said. “And in fact, the studies show the same level of brain that encourages you to use drugs also addicts you to food. “Food is addictive. You take someone on heroin, put them in one room, and someone hooked on cheese, put ’em in another room, and you take it away, I challenge you to tell me the person who’s hooked on heroin and who’s hooked on cheese.” The mayor identifies as a vegan, though on Monday he officially admitted sometimes eating fish. He was speaking as part of an effort to convince New Yorkers to switch to a more plant-based diet. “The more you eat plants [and] fruits, the more you have a healthy lifestyle away from over-processed food, the healthier you are going to be,” he said. “I know how I feel every day, and I want you to feel the same way every day.” Adams did not say which studies he was referring to. In 2015, researchers at the University of Michigan found that cheese was among foods people found hard to give up. But the study did not merit some of the headlines it generated, among them “This Explains a Lot: Study Finds That Cheese Is Just as Addictive as Drugs” and “Headed to Roquefort Rehab: Cheese Is as Addictive as Crack Cocaine”. Predictably, the internet did not take kindly to Adams’s words. Writer Tom Ricks said: “I’m into the hard stuff – aged parmesan and old gouda. Is there anywhere I can get help?” Among more serious responses, Dr Kim Sue, medical director for the National Harm Reduction Coalition and an addiction physician-anthropologist at Yale School of Medicine, said: “Weighing in from addiction medicine to ask [Adams] to please not make these claims about either heroin or cheese. “The stigma and moralising is rife and not useful.” Some New Yorkers would agree. On Monday, the Daily News cited “a source close to the mayor” when it said Adams “has been spotted chowing down on beef and chicken in addition to fish”. “Representatives for Adams did not return requests for comment on the beef and chicken details,” it added. Speaking to reporters about what New Yorkers should eat, Adams said his constituents should “ignore the noise” and not “worry about what’s on Mayor Adams’s plate”.",News/US news,‘Cheese is like heroin’: New York mayor raises eyebrows with drug comparison,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/cheese-is-like-heroin-new-york-mayor-eric-adams
2/8/2022,"Boris Johnson has made Jacob Rees-Mogg the new minister for “Brexit opportunities” and installed a key loyalist as his chief whip in a reshuffle intended to shore up his position following weeks of terrible headlines. Rees-Mogg, who was Commons leader, is moved to the Cabinet Office to take on a newly created role as Brexit opportunities minister, a cabinet-level job that also includes “government efficiency”.  Chris Heaton-Harris, formerly Europe minister in the Foreign Office, takes over as chief whip from Mark Spencer. Heaton-Harris was a key member of a parallel parliamentary organisation advising the prime minister amid his recent woes. Spencer, a trusted ally of Johnson, was widely criticised by Conservative MPs over a series of missteps, including whipping them to support the disgraced MP Owen Paterson. He has been made leader of the Commons in place of Rees-Mogg, overseeing the passage of government legislation. Stuart Andrew, who was deputy chief whip, is moved to be minister for housing in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, taking over from Christopher Pincher, who is expected to become a whip. Andrew becomes the 11th housing minister in 12 years, a continual churn that housing groups have argued means the sector is not properly considered by government. The changes come amid a wider shake-up of the team around Johnson, as the prime minister seeks to reassure mutinous Tory MPs, worried about alleged lockdown-breaking parties that are being investigated by police. Last Thursday, four senior No 10 aides quit or were pushed out: Johnson’s longstanding policy chief, Munira Mirza; Dan Rosenfield, his chief of staff; Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary, and his director of communications, Jack Doyle. While Mirza’s departure was a surprise – her resignation letter condemned Johnson for falsely linking Keir Starmer to the failure to bring the paedophile Jimmy Savile to justice – the other three had been tipped to leave amid the fallout from the party claims. Johnson’s new chief of staff is Steve Barclay, already the Cabinet Office minister, who will lead efforts to integrate his department with a new Office of the Prime Minister and liaise with backbenchers over areas such as future policy. In place of Doyle, Johnson appointed Guto Harri as director of communications, who held the same role for Johnson when he was mayor of London. Mirza was swiftly replaced by Andrew Griffith, a former investment banker and Sky executive who entered parliament in 2019. This internal reshuffle has faced some criticism. Some Tory MPs from northern “red wall” areas were critical of Griffith, who represents a safe seat in West Sussex, being handed a role shaping new government ideas. Barclay’s role as an MP, minister and chief of staff raised eyebrows as to the potential workload, while Harri has been immediately embroiled in controversy. In his first full day in the job, Harri gave an interview in which he described Johnson as “not a complete clown”, while later a report said Harri lobbied a former chief of staff at Downing Street not to ban the Chinese technology company Huawei over spying fears.",News/Politics,Rees-Mogg becomes minister for Brexit opportunities in Boris Johnson reshuffle,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/08/boris-johnson-starts-mini-reshuffle
2/8/2022,"Domestic critics of Emmanuel Macron, Nato hardliners and the leadership in Ukraine will be suspiciously examining the French president’s late-night remarks at his Moscow press conference on Monday for signs of freelancing. At one level, Macron, three months from a re-election campaign, stuck pretty faithfully to the script he had exhaustively agreed with his Nato partners before his meeting with Vladimir Putin, but at another level his particular view of Russia as a European nation, and lofty talk of a new security guarantees, will have set alarm bells ringing.  The specifics of the five hours of discussions between the French and Russian leaders, and points of convergence, were kept from the world at the press conference, but that did not stop Macron hinting at shifts in Nato’s outlook that some members say should never be made in response to military intimidation. The French president started by stressing the historically unacceptable presence of Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders. He also faithfully repeated the offers made by Nato and the US concerning mutual limitation of military deployments, more transparency for military activities or even a limitation of the deployment of short-range and intermediate missiles. He said in these areas Moscow and the west had the same demands. Moscow has already said it is ready to discuss these points but considers a commitment from Nato to cease all enlargement its primary demand. Here, Macron hinted at the need to acknowledge Russian concerns. He states: “There is no security for Europeans if there is no security for Russia”, a formulation of respect but one that also legitimises Moscow’s demands for a new security architecture based on the Russian concept of “indivisible security”. But what Macron meant was unclear. He said he firmly opposed repeating “the mistakes of the past about spheres of influence”, but then said “Russia is European. Whoever believes in Europe must know how to work with Russia and find the ways and the means to construct the European future among Europeans.” French officials at briefings, and Macron in passing at the press conference, spoke about the “Finlandisation” of Ukraine, a form of neutrality, an idea that has been floated before. Finland, which shares a 830-mile (1,335km) border with Russia, chose in 1947 not to become a Nato member and signed a “friendship treaty” with Russia that included limits on the size of Finland’s army, and other restrictions on its sovereignty. The so-called Paasikivi doctrine – named after Juho Kusti Paasikivi, its president at the time – nevertheless created a political consensus in Finland until the issue was ironically reopened by the current Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, concerned by what Russia was doing to threaten national sovereignty. But there is a critical difference between Ukraine and Finland. Ukraine would in effect be required by outside powers to take up the status of a neutral state. Given Ukraine’s stormy relationship with Russia, and the violence in the east of the country, it seems unlikely that Ukraine could ever be willing to become Finland 2. A lesser alternative would be that Ukraine’s right to join the defence pact of its choice could be restated but in practice shelved. Such a formulation could be squared by Macron’s assertion at the press conference that a new security architecture in Europe should not be created by cancelling the right of states to join the Nato alliance. Ukraine’s possible Nato status is something of a mirage since the country is nowhere near the opening stages of Nato membership, and the discussion of the topic probably obscures the true point of conflict – Russia’s desire to bring Ukraine not to a form of neutrality but back into its sphere of influence on the basis that the Kyiv government is illegitimate. Macron’s final proposal was “the strict and total” implementation of the Minsk accord, the 2014-15 agreement that contains the groundwork for a final settlement in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, parts of which have been under the control of pro-Russian separatists since April 2014. Since the separatists and Kyiv disagree on what Minsk requires, especially over sequencing, “strict implementation” clarifies only to the extent that it signals world powers are going to put renewed pressure on both sides to reach an agreement on the withdrawal of forces, free elections and the constitutional status for the rebel regions. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, last week ruled out special status. Russia by contrast would like special status to include a veto over national foreign policy, something Kyiv would see only as a western-endorsed dismemberment of its country by force. But Macron at the least may try to pin the Ukrainian government to a set of steps on how local elections in Donbas and the withdrawal of forces could occur. But it is an issue that has frustrated diplomats since 2015. Macron, as he himself concedes, may find it is not just Putin’s absurdly large table that is keeping the west and Russia so far apart.",News/World news,Emmanuel Macron’s remarks on Russia set alarm bells ringing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/emmanuel-macron-remark-russia-set-alarm-bell-ringing-ukraine-crisis-talk-vladimir-putin
2/8/2022,"Peloton, the troubled exercise equipment company, is replacing its chief executive and planning to axe 2,800 jobs as it deals with a post-pandemic sales crash. Co-founder John Foley, who has led the company for its entire 10-year existence, will step down as chief executive and become executive chair, the company told the Wall Street Journal, while the company will cut about 20% of corporate positions.  The move comes weeks after activist investor Blackwell Capital called for Peloton to fire Foley and explore a sale of the company. Amazon and Nike have reportedly expressed interest. Barry McCarthy, former chief financial officer of Spotify and Netflix, will become chief executive and president and join Peloton’s board, according to the Journal. Peloton became one of the highest-profile successes of the pandemic as people canceled gym memberships and bought its exercise bikes and treadmills to work out from home. Investors snapped up shares and the company was valued at $50bn in January 2021. But as the pandemic waned, sales slipped and a series of incidents left the company’s shareholders feeling jittery. Last May, Peloton recalled its two treadmills after the death of a child and dozens of other injuries. In November, the company reported sales in 2022 will be up to $1bn lower than expected. In December, Peloton’s shares collapsed again following the on-screen death of the Sex and the City character Mr Big while riding a Peloton in the series reboot, And Just Like That.

2/8/2022,"Having been instrumental in forcing the last two prime ministers out of office, Boris Johnson is on a hat-trick. Can he do it? Can Big Dog play his cards in such a way that a third prime ministerial scalp will be his – his in more ways than one? The answer feels like a hard yes, but this never-ending Greek tragedy is certainly taking its time. How’s your stamina? Like me, you maybe feel the Boristeia is dragging on a bit. Seemingly three plays in, Shagamemnon is still with us. Anyway: we go again. One calendar week after Johnson tried to wriggle off the “partygate” hook by shouting something grim about Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile, Keir Starmer was beset in the street by a mob shouting something grim about him and Jimmy Savile. It’s important to be clear that they were shouting a load of other grim stuff, too – but I’m afraid that isn’t the get-out Downing Street seems to think it is. In fact, it just underlines why no prime minister, ever, should be feeding dangerous conspiracy theories, which run the gamut from anti-vax all the way to antisemitism, via a selection of paedophile-based nonsense and much else besides. If recent rallies and demos have taught us anything, it’s that there is, increasingly, plenty of overlap. These days, all sorts of persuasions are fellow travellers.  You need to be against ALL this stuff, elementally, not just the bits that can’t get you out of a hole in the House of Commons. It’s the same with mobs: the mob that targeted Jacob Rees-Mogg and his son a while back was just as bad as the mob that surrounded Starmer and David Lammy on Monday, as was the mob that repeatedly abused Dominic Cummings in his own street. They’re all a pox and a signpost of worse to come, and no politician who truly cares about their country should pander to them. Moving on to No 10 Clowning Street, it’s been a lively few days of long knives, not all of which have been wielded by the prime minister. I imagine Johnson has always had to spread out Valentine’s Day – you can’t be in that many places at once – so perhaps it’s fitting that his St Valentine’s Day massacre started in early February and is still going. Some aides have been sacked, some more significant ones have sacked themselves, and there’s some kind of mini-reshuffle under way. Yes, as loyalists keep explaining, the PM is “rebooting” his Downing Street operation. I love the idea that this full-scale meltdown can somehow be rebooted. Like standing in the ruins of the reactor building at Chernobyl and going, “Have you tried switching it off and on again?” Or, as one No 10 aide explained of the personnel moves: “What this weekend was about is bringing in capable, grownup people who will make sure the machine works better. What we’re doing is … creating a structure which attracts professional grownups … ” Oh dear. I tend to shudder when people in politics decide to tell you they’re the “grownups”. There was a Labour conference a few years ago where most of Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench repeatedly boasted they were “the grownups”, with Starmer going for the full Principal Skinner by styling Labour as “the grownups in the room”. Yes and no, mate. Yes and no. At present, Johnson’s greatest advantage is the quality of his Brutuses (Bruti?). Reading another non-story about Liz Truss this morning – she had a birthday party for Thérèse Coffey a couple of weekends ago, apparently – leaves me more awestruck than ever at the 1D chess being played by Team Sunak. Unless Rishi’s grandmasters get it together, he’s going to have an uphill struggle to emerge as the Fortinbras in all this. As for the new grownups in Downing Street, it is impossible to have an opinion, one way or the other, about multi-hyphenate Steve Barclay, which is presumably the point. Until Monday, I would have said the same about the new spin doctor, Guto Harri. For years, Harri has been one of those people in public life who make you think you can get away with never finding out who they are. Like Topher Grace, or the Duchess of Kent. It’s a kind of give-a-toss triage, where the mind registers the name but reflexively declines to investigate. Do imagine my distress, then, to realise yesterday that as far as Guto Harri is concerned, this state of blissful indifference can’t continue. Here he comes, gurning up Downing Street with a bag from Tesco and considerable baggage from his time lobbying for Huawei. First impressions of the new No 10 comms chief? Harri looks a bit like what might happen if you put Charles Moore through an Instagram filter. Competence-wise, unfortunately, he looks to be firing at the same level as an unfiltered Charles Moore, with his first day in the job unfolding with the same tactical skill and foresight as the latter’s plan to save Owen Paterson. Seemingly the only person excited about Guto Harri’s appointment is trackie-bummed antihero Dominic Cummings, who – and I’m going to shock you – takes a dim view of it. That said, Cummings will never allow anything to divert him for long from his nuclear attacks on Carrie Johnson, which now seem diurnal. Clearly, Mrs Johnson has made a number of mistakes, but it does feel way past time for acting like the buck stops with her. Why then, we have to ask, has that message yet to be got by Cummings? He increasingly comes off as someone using Carrie to sublimate the peculiar nature of his anger towards his former preciousssss, Boris. The way Dom sees it, Johnson’s problem was basically that “he got a wrong ‘un pregnant”. How revealing of Cummings that he should alight on that styling, with its hideous old-fashioned echoes of a time where men were described as being “caught” by the women they impregnated, as though all their wonderful promise had been sapped out of them by some two-bit succubus. What crap. You really don’t hear this kind of talk very much these days from people with half a brain, and no matter how often Dominic Cummings remembers he needs to mention this or that “brilliant woman” on his blog, I am not the only one to notice what a sad little relic this self-styled futurist so often resembles. As we move into act 25 of the shitshow, then, it’s worth course-correcting to remember that the only person responsible for messing up Boris Johnson’s life and dream job is Boris Johnson. The rest are just bit parts – whatever they’d like to think. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,A reboot at No 10?

2/8/2022,"Amy Koppelman directs this movie, which she has adapted from her 2003 novel: a painful, intimate, sincerely intended study of a young woman’s postnatal depression. Amanda Seyfried plays Julie, a children’s author who had a self-harming episode while she was looking after her infant son and after the birth of her second child is reluctant to take antidepressants. The tone is unsubtly set when Julie’s psychiatrist, played by Paul Giamatti, quotes Sylvia Plath’s poem Balloons. Was that a well-chosen author to invoke in the circumstances? Finn Wittrock plays Julie’s too-good-to-be-true dreamboat of a partner Ethan and Amy Irving has a cameo as Julie’s mother, separated from Julie’s father – whose own history of mental illness is supposed be a contributory factor, though the coy, blurry Super-8 memory flashback-sequences don’t give any clear hint of how exactly his disorder manifested itself. At one stage, Ethan complains that he is walking on eggshells around Julie. So is the movie. In between her first and second pregnancy, Julie is nervous and upset at the idea of moving out of their apartment to a lovely house in the country, an issue which takes the film a little close to #FirstWorldProblems territory.  The upsetting main events take place off camera, which is arguably the most responsible way to approach the subject. (News media are bound by rules on this subject, much more strictly than movies.) But I found something a little avoidant here; the film floats in a haze of ethereal lite-tragedy towards its end point, which the drama tactfully – but ingeniously – leapfrogs with a flashforward taking us to a point 20 years further on, when Julie’s daughter has a baby of her own. The film needed less sensitive good taste and more explicit storytelling passion.

2/8/2022,"I love mushrooms, but my partner hates their texture. How can I make her see the error of her ways?Ollie, London As with any difficult relationship, Ollie, it can take work, but there is hope. “When you say, ‘I don’t like mushrooms’, it’s like saying you don’t like wine,” says self-confessed fungus obsessive Will Murray. “There are so many varieties out there, and they all behave in different ways.” The chef and co-founder of Fallow in London, who even grows his own at the restaurant, adds: “If, for example, you brine and deep-fry grey oyster mushrooms, they take on the texture of fried chicken.”  Perhaps a simpler strategy in the fight against squishy, spongy mushrooms, however, is to fry them on a high heat. “You need to be in danger of setting off the smoke alarm, or you’re not doing it properly,” Murray says. Then, as in life, it pays to be patient – and use more butter than seems reasonable. “Mushrooms hold a lot of liquid, so you need to fry them for quite a while to get them crisp,” says Helen Graham, head chef of veg-led Bubala in London. “If you don’t take them to the colour you want before adding other stuff to the pan, the mushrooms will never catch up.” You could also try replicating Bubala’s charred oyster mushroom skewers. “We marinate the mushrooms in soy sauce, agave, coriander seeds, garlic and vegetable oil, then thread on to skewers and grill,” Graham says. “The agave helps to caramelise them, and obviously the oil helps to give crispiness and a really nice texture.” Alternatively, pop a portobello in a bun. “I grew up in the Middle East, where it’s always barbecue weather,” says Noor Murad, who heads up the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen. “I love throwing mushrooms on the grill and slathering them in barbecue sauce [homemade or store-bought].” Melt a square of cheese on top, if you fancy, and serve with slaw. It’s also worth considering how you prep the mushrooms. “You want to keep their meaty integrity, so you can really get your teeth into them, which means don’t chop them too small,” Murad explains. That said, a duxelles [finely chopped mushrooms cooked in butter with onions or shallots and herbs] might be a good gateway. “If she doesn’t enjoy the texture of mushrooms, make a very finely chopped duxelles,” Murray says. “The mushrooms dissolve into the sauce and add a rich undercurrent of earthy umami.” Spread on toast, add to omelettes or mashed potato, or go all out with a wellington. You could also, of course, do away with cooking them altogether. “Raw mushrooms aren’t slimy,” says Murray, who suggests thinly slicing chestnuts or portobellos, dressing them with sherry vinegar (“or even a little sherry”), dijon mustard, olive oil, fresh herbs and minced garlic, then adding to salads. Dried mushrooms, meanwhile, have “second chance” written all over them. “They’re amazing, especially in the base of soups and stews,” Murad says. “You don’t get the texture, but you’ll get that umaminess – maybe that’s a good way to get Ollie’s partner to like mushrooms.” Graham agrees. She adds shiitake (“porcini would be equally delicious”) and kombu to stock, reduces down “with something tangy like pomegranate molasses”, then uses it as a sauce for cabbage. Happily, it’s good with other veg, too, so there’s shroom to manoeuvre. *groans*  Got a culinary dilemma?

2/8/2022,"Thousands of mental health patients in England are being treated in buildings that are “dangerous” and unfit for purpose, Britain’s most senior psychiatrist has warned. Dr Adrian James, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, urged the government to fund six new mental health hospitals as part of its promise to build 48 new hospitals by 2030.  Crumbling NHS buildings, leaky roofs and faulty equipment are putting the most seriously mentally ill people in the country at risk of harm and hindering their chances of recovery, James said. The government has pledged billions in funding to build 48 hospitals by 2030. Of the first 40 hospital projects announced, only two were for mental health, according to the college. The final eight projects have not yet been named but James said at least six of these should be for mental health patients, in order “to address the imbalance of the programme”. “Thousands of people with a mental illness in England are being treated in mental health hospitals that are dangerously old and not fit for purpose,” James said. “Up and down the country psychiatrists are having to assess and treat patients in buildings that are falling apart and crumbling away. “People with a mental illness will be let down unless we have buildings that are fit for purpose. The government can no longer afford to pay lip-service to parity of esteem and treat mental health as an after-thought. We need a firm commitment from government that at least six of the new hospitals will be for mental health.” A total of 269 psychiatrist colleagues of James have written a letter to their MP highlighting their concerns over the dire state of mental health hospitals. They have also issued a warning that the number of people requiring mental health support is unlikely to fall to pre-pandemic levels. Data shows record numbers are seeking help while NHS staff are struggling to deal with the huge backlog of care. The Covid crisis has led to a wave of new or worsening cases of mental ill-health. Mental healthcare has also deteriorated during the pandemic, with people not getting the support they need and not knowing where to turn in a crisis, which has itself further damaged some people’s mental health. The most recent survey from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of 17,322 people who used NHS community mental health services in England in 2020 and 2021 found people’s experience of some areas of care is at its lowest point for eight years. While the NHS estate as a whole needs urgent attention, mental health facilities are in greater need than most, says the letter from psychiatrists to MPs. “In comparison with the general acute estate, nearly twice as much of the mental health estate in use today was built prior to 1948. “These crumbling NHS buildings, with leaking roofs and faulty equipment – paired with the inability to implement Covid safety measures such as social distancing – are endangering patients and hindering their recovery.” According to the most recently available NHS data, the “high risk” maintenance backlog across mental health and learning disability sites increased by 34% compared with the previous year, and by 336% compared with four years ago, the college said. One retired psychiatrist told their MP: “Do you realise that over my professional life the availability and quality of psychiatric inpatient facilities in the UK have deteriorated drastically? “Many people wrongly imagine that ‘things must be getting better’ but the opposite is the case. Only serious action by government can end this slide into a total failure to provide care for people with severe forms of mental ill-health.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.",News/Society,Call for six new mental health hospitals in England as buildings ‘crumble away’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/08/call-for-six-new-mental-health-hospitals-in-england-as-buildings-crumble-away
2/8/2022,"Members of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community have accused the government of hypocrisy after ministers condemned a Holocaust joke by Jimmy Carr while pushing through a raft of legislation hostile to their way of life. The Traveller Movement, which represents the GRT community, said it had been “surprised” by the government’s promises to better protect the community against hate speech following the backlash to Carr’s joke, in which he said the genocide of Romany and Sinti gypsies in the Holocaust was ignored because people did not want to “focus on the positives”.  Greg Sproston, the policy and campaigns manager for the Traveller Movement, said the government was currently trying to pass three bills – on policing, nationality and borders and elections – all of which woud “have disproportionately negative impacts” on the GRT community. He added that a national strategy to reduce inequality in the community announced over two years ago “still has not materialised”. “If the government is serious about protecting and supporting these communities, they would scrap this discriminatory legislation and bring forward the strategy without delay,” he said. The policing bill is especially controversial within the GRT community as it would give police powers to move Travellers’ camps if anyone complained, regardless of whether a crime had been committed. Billy Welch, the head gypsy and spokesperson for the UK’s Roma population, said he was consulting lawyers to see if Carr could be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred. He said the comedian’s joke was offensive in part because of the legacy of trauma after between 200,000 and 2 million Romany and Sinti gypsies were murdered in the Holocaust. “There are many still living who witnessed the brutality of what happened, and many more who lost their families in barbarous and sadistic murders. Making a joke of it is too painful,” he said. The Traveller Movement has called on Netflix, which aired the His Dark Material special containing the joke in December, to remove the gag and apologise. The group’s petition has gained thousands of signatories. The charity has also offered to help the platform amend its editorial guidelines to prevent a repeat of the incident. “It’s hard to over-stress the hurt and distress this causes,” Sproston said.Sproston said Carr’s joke demonstrated that the GRT community was consistently “seen as low-hanging fruit or a legitimate target”, and that many people did not understand that they were a defined ethnic minority whose rights were protected by law. He said one young Irish Traveller told him “no matter what he achieved or where he is in life, as soon as he hears a comment like that it diminishes his progress and he’s back to square one, because it reminds him of everything society thinks about him”.A recent survey by University of Birmingham researchers found that 44% of people in the UK had negative attitudes towards GRT people, making them the “least liked group”, nearly double the level for Muslims, who were the group to receive the next most prejudice. Research by the Traveller Movement in 2017 found that 91% of GRT people had experienced discrimination, which it described as “the last acceptable form of racism”. These attitudes have a profound impact on areas such as employment and education, where GRT people underperform, and the criminal justice system, where they are over-represented. Carr has defended the joke as raising awareness of the genocide of an estimated 25-50% of Europe’s population of Roma and Sinti gypsies, and some commenters have suggested it may have been intended ironically to highlight prejudice against the GRT community. However, Sproston said the audience’s laughter and some reactions on social media show that anti-GRT attitudes are so deeply entrenched that many took the joke at face value, which could further harm an already deeply disadvantaged community. Rosa Cisneros, a member of the GRT community who researches Romany culture at Coventry University, said she was “sad but not surprised” by Carr’s joke. “This situation has highlighted that anti-Gypsyism and Romaphobia still exists today. For me, it isn’t about censoring Jimmy Carr or being offended or me being part of the ‘woke’ brigade that I want to just cancel a show or infringe on someone’s freedom of speech and his rights. No, I am utterly horrified that we live in a space where such harmful and hateful speech is accepted and seen as a joke.” A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said the government was “committed” to the national strategy to support the GRT community, and was supporting councils to build more authorised Traveller sites, which he said had increased by 46% since 2010. He added: “But it is only right to give councils and the police powers to tackle the small minority of Travellers breaking the rules on unauthorised sites, which undermine good community relations.”",Arts/Culture,Roma accuse government of hypocrisy over Jimmy Carr joke,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/07/romas-accuse-government-of-hypocrisy-over-jimmy-carr-joke
2/8/2022,"The previously unknown subject of a Kurt Schwitters painting has been identified as Ludwig Warschauer, the subject of one of MI5’s very first anti-spy operations, who was sent to Britain to spy for the Gestapo. Simon Parkin made the discovery while researching his book The Island of Extraordinary Captives, a history of Hutchinson Camp, a second world war prison camp on the Isle of Man. Opened on 13 July 1940, the camp was home to around 1,200 Germans and Austrians who had fled to Britain to escape Nazism when war broke out. Its creation was part of the British government’s policy of mass internment of the so-called “enemy aliens” they had previously welcomed to the country – with prisoners including Schwitters, the celebrated German Dadaist, along with a host of other artists.  Schwitters, said Parkin, produced “dozens” of portraits while interned, “either as favours to his friends, or to sell them as mementoes to eminent internees - £3 for a head and shoulders; £4 for head, shoulders and arms; £5 for a half figure”. Many of the portraits are well-known, but while Parkin was writing the book, he was sent a document showing thumbnails of all known Schwitters portraits by Dr Isabel Schulz, curator of the Kurt Schwitters archive at the Sprengel Museum in Hanover. One of them bore a “striking resemblance” to a photograph he had seen of Warschauer in MI5’s security files. Warschauer was a German national who fled to Britain shortly before war broke out. He claimed to be the inventor of the Tefifon, a recording device that functioned like a Dictaphone, and had powerful British allies, including the Conservative MP Herbert Williams, who was chairman of the company financing the Tefifon’s development, and the home secretary John Anderson, who came to his home to watch a demonstration. But MI5 agents suspected he had come to Britain as a Gestapo plant, and he became the subject of a long-running investigation. He went on to confess and was deported to Germany after the war ended. Warschauer had helped Elisabeth Kohsen and her children flee Nazi Germany shortly before the outbreak of war, in exchange for her hand in marriage. Parkin managed to contact her daughter, Monica Schubert, to ask if she recognised the man in the portrait. “She told me that not only did she recognise the man as Warschauer, but she also personally knew the painting itself: it had hung in the living room of the family home after the war,” said Parkin. “Her mother had only relinquished the portrait when, after the war Warschauer – whom she had by now divorced, because of his lies – requested the portrait be returned to him in Germany.” The portrait had been offered for auction at Horster Auktionshaus in March 2007 by an “anonymous artist”, but was withdrawn after the seller learned that it was a painting by Kurt Schwitters. A year later, it was offered again, but not sold, and its whereabouts are currently unknown. “To have the identity of a sitter in a Kurt Schwitters portrait was a tremendous high. When I passed all this information to Dr Schulz, she updated Schwitters’ catalogue raisonné,” said Parkin. “It only remains now to find out the current whereabouts of the portrait. I was already convinced the individual in the portrait was Warschauer before his stepdaughter confirmed the fact to me … The likeness is uncanny – even if the portrait gives the more flattering likeness.”",Arts/Books,Kurt Schwitters’ unknown portrait sitter identified as wartime German spy,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/08/kurt-schwitters-unknown-portrait-sitter-identified-as-wartime-german-spy
2/8/2022,"The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s Montana-set drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a threatening rancher, has swept the board at the Oscar nominations. The film is up for a dozen prizes, including best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best actor for Cumberbatch, best supporting actress for Kirsten Dunst and best supporting actor for both Kodi Smit-McPhee and Jesse Plemons.  Campion last won an Oscar in 1994 for The Piano, which began its journey in Cannes, where it won the Palme d’Or. That film was nominated for best director and best picture but lost out to Schindler’s List, with Campion making do with best adapted screenplay. She now becomes the first female film-maker to have two best director nominations. If The Power of the Dog triumphs, it will be the second consecutive year a woman has won best picture and best director, following Chloé Zhao’s run with Nomadland. The only other female director to have taken either prize is Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010. Up for 10 awards is Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi classic set in the distant future. Steven Spielberg’s take on West Side Story took seven nominations, as did Belfast, Kenneth Branagh’s black-and-white autobiographical coming-of-age tale. One of these was for Judi Dench, whose nod in the best supporting actress category makes her the second oldest acting Oscar nominee ever (following Christopher Plummer’s nod for All the Money in the World, when he was 88). Dench’s Belfast co-star, Ciarán Hinds, is also nominated for best supporting actor; Branagh is up for best director and best original screenplay. Branagh becomes the first person to secure Oscar nominations in seven different categories, having previously been up for live action short, best adapted screenplay, best supporting actor and best actor (for Henry V). Speaking on Tuesday, Branagh, who has yet to win an Academy Award, said he was thinking of “my mother and father, and my grandparents - how proud they were to be Irish, how much this city meant to them. “They would have been overwhelmed by this incredible honour - as am I. Given a story as personal as this one, it’s a hell of a day for my family, and the family of our film.” Olivia Colman, who won best actress in 2019 for The Favourite, is in contention in the same category this year for her role as a depressed author holidaying on a Greek island in The Lost Daughter. Jessie Buckley, who plays her character’s younger self, is also in the running for best supporting actress. Colman was snubbed in the equivalent Bafta shortlist last week, as was Kristen Stewart for her turn as Princess Diana in Spencer. Both women feature on the Oscars list however, alongside Nicole Kidman as Lucille Ball in Being the Ricardos, Jessica Chastain in televangelist biopic The Eyes of Tammy Faye and Penélope Cruz for her latest collaboration with Pedro Almodovar, Parallel Mothers. Will Smith moves into pole position for his first ever Oscar win for his performance as the ambitious father and tennis coach to a young Venus and Serena Williams in King Richard, which also picked up a nomination for his young co-star, Aunjanue Ellis, as supporting actress. The best actor shortlist is rounded out by Cumberbatch, Andrew Garfield, who plays Rent creator Jonathan Larson in Lin-Miranda Manuel’s tick, tick … boom!, Denzel Washington for The Tragedy of Macbeth and Javier Bardem for Being the Ricardos. All five men are repeat nominees, and taken as a whole, the 2022 shortlist was light on new talent. Yet a few surprises did emerge, in particular the three nominations for CODA, a Sundance hit featuring a predominantly deaf cast. Troy Kotsur’s best supporting actor nomination makes him only the second ever deaf actor up for an Oscar, following his CODA co-star Marlee Matlin’s win in 1986 for Children of a Lesser God. CODA joins an eclectic best picture shortlist – the only category which at this stage all 9,500 Oscar members vote for – alongside The Power of the Dog, Dune, Belfast, West Side Story, Drive My Car, Don’t Look Up, King Richard, Licorice Pizza and Nightmare Alley. Drive My Car’s director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, is also nominated for best director, best adapted screenplay and best international feature – a breakthrough for a film not in the English language which would have felt more striking before the success in February 2020 of Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite. The nominations were announced by black-ish star Tracee Ellis Ross and comedian Leslie Jordan, a healthcare worker, a basketball-loving high schooler, a teacher and a New York firefighter. Voting closes in more than a month, before the ceremony itself on 27 March 2022. The Bafta awards take place a fortnight beforehand. Last year’s mid-pandemic ceremony was an experimental, socially distanced affair held at Los Angeles’s Union Station, which saw record-breakingly low TV audiences tuning in. Details of this year’s event are still to be confirmed, but the Academy has indicated that it will again feature a host. Names rumoured to be taking on the post include Conan O’Brien, Pete Davidson and Spider-Man star Tom Holland.

2/8/2022,"Rebekah Vardy said she would “love” to leak stories about Coleen Rooney to the media, according to messages disclosed at the high court. The court filings suggest Vardy and her former agent Caroline Watt had an ongoing relationship with reporters at the Sun newspaper and discussed at length how to leak stories to the tabloid.  Vardy is suing Rooney for libel in the so-called “Wagatha Christie” case, over an allegation that Vardy was responsible for leaking a series of stories from Rooney’s private Instagram account to the Sun. Both women are married to footballers – respectively Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy and the Derby County manager, Wayne Rooney. The filings also show that Vardy described Rooney as a “nasty bitch” and a “cunt” who “needs to get over herself” in private messages disclosed at a court hearing on Tuesday. Rooney ran a sting operation in 2019 by putting three fake stories on her Instagram account and slowly reducing which accounts could view the posts. When only Vardy could see the Instagram posts, alleges Rooney, and the fake stories kept appearing in the Sun, she went public with the claim. Vardy strongly denies the accusation and has run up a multimillion-pound legal bill bringing a libel case. After one story from Rooney’s private Instagram appeared in the Sun, Rooney posted to her followers: “Someone on here is selling stories again to this scum of a paper. It’s sad to think someone who I have accepted to follow me is betraying [me] for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.” Discussing this post, Watt allegedly acknowledged a role in providing information to the Sun, according to messages disclosed to the court: “Such a victim. Poor Coleen … And it wasn’t someone she trusted. It was me.” The duo also raised concerns that Rooney increasingly suspected Vardy of leaking to the media and had unfollowed her on Instagram. Watt suggested that if any issues were raised they would claim that “one of the girls in the office has my old laptop that had your passwords saved on it, so it will have been them”. At one point, according to the messages, Vardy says she has no idea how Rooney would ever know who was responsible for providing information “unless halls [Sun journalist Andy Halls] has leaked it”. Vardy also complained that the Sun was not buying her photographs, telling Watt “we still need to make money” and suggesting they contact senior executives at the newspaper. Some of the private messages relating to the case are missing, for a variety of unfortunate reasons. Vardy’s former agent said her mobile phone was accidentally dropped in the North Sea shortly after Rooney’s lawyers requested access to the device. “Coincidentally, around the same time, all media files from Mrs Vardy’s WhatsApp conversation with Ms Watt also bizarrely disappeared (and from all backups), whilst apparently in the process of exporting it to her solicitors,” said Rooney’s lawyers. Jamie Vardy, the Leicester City striker, also said that his “WhatsApp was hacked and all conversations were deleted and could not be restored”, while declining to allow Rooney’s lawyers to examine his phone. The laptop used by Vardy during the crucial period also “no longer functions”, while messages between Rebekah Vardy and Halls appear to have been deleted. Rebekah Vardy’s own expert described the data recovery situation as “surprising” and “unusual”. The disclosures suggests Vardy and Watt had repeated conversations about about stories going to the Sun. At one point they discussed whether to provide the newspaper with a story about an England footballer who had a secret child as a result of an affair. A month later the Sun published a story with the headline “Married England ace has lovechild”. Vardy has accepted that payments were made to her by the Sun in the run-up to Rooney’s accusation. Rooney’s lawyers are seeking disclosure of these payments. When Rooney went public with the accusation that Vardy was leaking articles to the Sun, Vardy texted her agent: “That’s war.” According to the messages disclosed at the court hearing, her agent replied: “You will have to say that you don’t speak to anyone about her but that recently your insta has even been following people you don’t follow … Just say you have allowed a company to access it for sponsored posts and a former social media agency that you worked with too.” Rooney’s lawyers claim that “Vardy was a repeated leaker of private information to the Sun”. Vardy denies this and her lawyers say there is no evidence that she leaked the key stories at the centre of the case. At the high court, they said the conversations between Vardy and Watt were evidence the duo were leaking messages from Instagram to the Sun: “It is clear from the disclosure that Ms Vardy knew what Ms Watt was doing. … She knew it was happening and the lack of any criticism that this was going on, let alone surprise, demonstrates that this was agreed.” The libel case is due to go to trial later this year.",News/UK news,Rebekah Vardy said she would ‘love’ to leak stories about Coleen Rooney to media,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/rebekah-vardy-said-she-would-love-to-leak-stories-about-coleen-rooney-to-media-instagram
2/8/2022,"Comedy is a barometer of popular attitudes. What people deem funny, and what they feel is acceptable to laugh at, tells us a lot about society. After the comedian Jimmy Carr “joked” that the Nazis’ industrialised extermination of Europe’s Roma population was a “positive”, several Tory ministers decided that a line did actually exist in public discourse, and that this time it had well and truly been crossed. Carr’s comments were “abhorrent and they just shouldn’t be on television,” declared the culture secretary and newly minted tribune of the oppressed, Nadine Dorries. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, denounced Carr’s “horrid” joke and called for audiences to boycott him.  To paraphrase Luke 15:7, surely there is more joy in heaven over the repentance of one Tory woke-basher than 99 people who haven’t used public platforms to stigmatise minorities. Yet, as disturbing as Carr’s grotesque remarks were, the audience’s laughter – rather than, say, shocked silence or gasps – was at least as horrifying. Why did so many express public amusement at the enslavement, torture and gassing of a group of people? Because in the UK, Gypsies, Roma and Travellers are a minority that is acceptable, permissible and indeed fashionable to stigmatise and hate – and the ministers condemning Carr have played a role. Granted, the Tories are guilty of many sins, but inventing this ancient hatred is not one of them. Roma people have been subjected to profound persecution across Europe since the middle ages – from enslavement to expulsion to murder – and England’s so-called “Egyptians Act” of 1530 sought to remove them en masse. But the Tories continue to exploit and stoke this bigotry for political gain. Back in 2007, one Tory pundit congratulated Dorries for writing about “why Gypsies and Travellers aren’t welcome in her constituency”; in that post, the then backbencher detailed her “solution to the Traveller problem”, in which they should be legally forbidden from following a nomadic tradition which has been on these shores for centuries. When Javid was the home secretary, he was condemned in Travellers Times in 2019 for “drawing on a long tradition on Conservative politics of using Gypsy and Traveller families as a community of fear and blame”, after he drew up proposals to further criminalise them. Indeed, there was little outcry at the Tories’ attempts to exploit anti-GRT sentiment for political gain in the 2019 election. Michael Gove listed cracking down on “illegal Traveller incursions” as a key election priority. Tory candidates lined up to centre hostility to GRT camps in their election campaigns, while the Tory candidate for Crewe and Nantwich led a demonstration against the local GRT community. This ugly rhetoric has only continued since: the Tory MP for Ashfield, Lee Anderson – a former Labour councillor – denounced local Travellers as thieves likely to be “seen leaving your garden shed at 3 o’clock in the morning, probably with your lawnmower and half of your tools”. Meanwhile, when the Scottish Tory MP Douglas Ross was asked what he’d do if he was prime minister for a day, rather than choosing, say, housing the homeless or fighting child poverty, he opted instead for “tougher enforcement against Gypsies and Travellers”. There’s a long history of this – Michael Howard was condemned for “tapping into the deepest vein of bigotry in our society” when he made clearing unauthorised Gypsy camps a key plank of the Tories’ 2005 election campaign – but it’s not just the Tories who have mined this rich seam of prejudice. As Labour home secretary, Jack Straw once described Gypsies as people who “think that it’s perfectly OK for them to cause mayhem in an area, to go burgling, thieving, breaking into vehicles, causing all kinds of other trouble including defecating in the doorways of firms and so on”. (The Home Office later clarified he was attacking “criminal gangs” of Travellers rather than the group as a whole.) The New Labour stalwart David Blunkett was reprimanded by David Cameron after warning of riots if Roma people did not integrate more. But this Tory government has fused hateful rhetoric with laws that persecute. Their policing bill has not only sought to suppress peaceful protest by reclassifying trespass as a criminal rather than a civil offence; it would allow police to arrest GRT people – who are facing a woeful lack of authorised sites where they can settle – if they set up on unauthorised ones. Police could confiscate their homes, impose crippling fines and lock them up for up to three months. A hostile environment has been built for this intentionally marginalised minority by stripping them of legal spaces for them to move to, and then when they are driven by lack of options to illegally pitch, they face the full weight of the state crashing down on their backs. Against this backdrop, is the laughter at Carr’s mockery of genocide surprising, even as it shocks us? This is a country in which only four in 10 parents would be happy for their child to hang out at the home of a GRT friend, in large part because powerful people have sent a strong signal to the public: that the centuries-old bullying of this minority is not only understandable, it is acceptable. The real reason there has been little to no public education on the Nazi genocide of Europe’s Roma people is straightforward: it would mean a reckoning with a deep-rooted prejudice which continues to this day. That’s why Carr’s obscene “joke” was received by enthusiastic laughter – and the politicians now wringing their hands are partly to blame.

2/8/2022,"If the polymathic Bamber Gascoigne was ever irked by the fact that he was best known to the British public for the phrase: “Fingers on buzzers … your starter for 10,” he never showed it. More than 30 years after his retirement as the quizmaster on University Challenge – a post he had held for a quarter of a century between 1962 and 1987 – the phrase still dogged his footsteps, despite everything else he did. Gascoigne, who has died aged 87, with his easy patrician manner, born of a family steeped in centuries of aristocratic connections, proved an inspired if incongruous choice to chair a television quiz show on a commercial channel, even in the early 1960s. He looked and spoke like a junior don, gradually evolving into an uncensorious professor. He did not mind being parodied by Griff Rhys Jones in the anarchic 80s Young Ones comedy series, or by Mark Gatiss in the film Starter for Ten in 2006 – about a student desperate to appear on the show – and he even played himself in an episode of the Jonathan Creek mystery series.  His genial presence – fair, curly hair and tolerant smile – hovered over University Challenge long after it was revived in 1994 under his more acerbic successor, Jeremy Paxman, who often displayed incredulity at the ignorance of contestants. Gascoigne never showed such impatience. Gascoigne, who was not much older than the contestants when the quiz started (and did not look much older than them when Granada first ended it in 1987), had much to do with the show’s enduring success. Despite being pitched at a level of knowledge above the heads of many viewers, it did not patronise or condescend either to those taking part or those watching. The show, originally based on an American television quiz called College Bowl, required only 40 days a year of Gascoigne’s time, for which he was initially paid £40 a week. That meant he could indulge his wide-ranging other interests, including opera, theatre and the arts along with a number of serious historical studies, some linked to television documentary series. “University Challenge gave me economic freedom, although not much,” he told the Daily Telegraph in 2012. “I love playing games, the students were incredibly nice and it was great fun. I have only watched it two or three times since – but then I never watched myself either. We don’t watch television as early as 8.30 in the evening so I have only seen it very few times.” Gascoigne was the son of Lt Col Derick Gascoigne and his wife, Midi O’Neill. He was descended from a long line of military men and the Gascoignes traced their roots back through Yorkshire landowners to the 14th century. Bamber was a family name too – an 18th-century predecessor of the same name had been an MP. His uncle Terence O’Neill was the Ulster Unionist prime minister of Northern Ireland in the 60s. There were family connections also with the Cecils, Tudor and Victorian power-brokers and prime ministers. He was educated at Sunningdale prep school, Berkshire, and was a scholar at Eton. He claimed that the scholarship boys were looked on as impoverished scum and although he said he enjoyed his time at the college, he would not have sent a son there because he did not believe in the separation of social groups. National service in the Grenadier Guards was followed by an English literature degree at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and a year in the US at Yale. At Cambridge he reviewed plays for Granta and then became theatre critic of the Spectator and the Observer, from which he was plucked to chair the new university quiz show. At Cambridge he had written a review, Share My Lettuce, which was produced in the West End, starring Maggie Smith and Kenneth Williams. Over the years it was followed by other plays: Leda Had a Little Swan made it to New York in 1968 (it had been refused a licence by the lord chamberlain, whose responsibilities then included censoring plays, in London the previous year); The Feydeau Farce Festival of 1909 was put on at Greenwich in 1972 and Big in Brazil was produced at the Old Vic in 1984. For television Gascoigne wrote and presented a major documentary series for Granada called The Christians in 1977, co-funded by Dutch and German channels. The series took three years to research and present and Gascoigne insisted – in the face of criticism from the church – that his lay status was precisely what was required: he said he wanted Christians to assume he was a believer and non-Christians to assume he was not. Further documentaries included Victorian Values in 1987, Man and Music in 1987 and the Great Moghuls in 1990. Usually these were accompanied by books. There were also novels, potboilers and short histories and a bestseller in Quest for the Golden Hare (1983), which set readers clues to finding the object that had been hidden somewhere in Britain. From 2000 he became editor-in-chief of historyworld.net and he also accumulated trusteeships in the arts, at the National and Tate galleries, at the Royal Opera House and the National Trust. He was appointed CBE in 2018. Gascoigne was unexpectedly left a 16th-century stately home, West Horsley Place – once owned by Henry VIII – near Guildford, Surrey, by his great-aunt Mary Innes-Ker, the Duchess of Roxburgh, who died aged 99 in 2014. The house, with its 50 rooms and 380 acres of grounds, was in a dilapidated condition, as she had lived alone for many years and had not been able to maintain the building. “Every time there was a new drip, she thought: get a new bucket,” he said in 2018. Instead of selling the property, as the duchess had imagined he would, Gascoigne and his wife, Christina, decided it should be renovated and turned into a community arts centre. The £10m cost of repairs was largely met by selling much of the contents, including paintings by Edward Burne-Jones and Lord Leighton’s famous Flaming June, at Sotheby’s. A 700-seat opera house was built by Grange Park Opera in the grounds and the house itself is intended to be used for conferences, classes and for filming. “We both felt it was a bit feeble not to give it a shot,” he explained. “A place that for several centuries has been entirely private, somewhere people did not even really know was there, can look forward to many centuries of people enjoying it. I think that’s a wonderful thing.” The duchess’s ashes are buried under the orchestra pit. Gascoigne had met Christina (nee Ditchburn), a photographer and ceramicist, at Cambridge, and they married in 1965. She survives him.
