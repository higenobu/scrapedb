4/1/2022,"The White House said the US has evidence that the war against Ukraine has been “a strategic disaster” for Russia. “We have seen incontrovertible evidence that this has been a strategic disaster for Russia,” director of communications Kate Bedingfield said, adding that Russia is “working to redefine the initial aims of their invasion”. US president Joe Biden said that Russian president Vladimir Putin “seems to be self-isolated” and noted “there’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,” without citing evidence. Russia has threatened to halt contracts supplying Europe with a third of its gas unless they are paid in Russian currency. Putin signed a decree on Thursday saying foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday. He said contracts would be halted if these payments were not made. Germany and France rejected the demands and said they amounted to “blackmail”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy repeated his warning that Russia is preparing for “powerful strikes” in the Donbas region after appearing to withdraw from an assault on Kyiv. The Pentagon also said that Russia may be repositioning some of its forces to send them to the Donbas. Nato’s chief Jens Stoltenberg said Russian forces are not withdrawing, but regrouping. He also said the alliance had yet to be convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith in peace talks in Istanbul because Moscow’s military objective since launching its invasion of Ukraine had not changed. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine were due to restart online on Friday morning. Russia is redeploying elements of its forces from Georgia to reinforce its invasion, British military intelligence said on Thursday. “It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion,” the ministry added. A humanitarian corridor is set to be opened from 10am on Friday morning to allow civilians out of the besieged port city of Mariupol, which is in the Donbas in south-eastern Ukraine. It follows “a personal request from the French president and German chancellor to Russian president Vladimir Putin”, it said. A convoy of Ukrainian buses has set out for Mariupol to try to deliver humanitarian supplies and bring out trapped civilians, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said. EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday, with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions. EU officials close to the preparations of the summit said any help given to Russia would damage China’s international reputation and jeopardise relations with its biggest trade partners – Europe and the United States. Russian forces have reportedly left the Chernobyl power plant, the Ukrainian Atomic Energy Ministry said, citing personnel at the site. Russian troops began leaving after soldiers got “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company said. Energoatom said the Russians had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant and “panicked at the first sign of illness,” which “showed up very quickly,” and began preparing to leave, Energoatom said. Britain and its allies have agreed to send more lethal military aid to Ukraine to help defend it against Russia’s invasion, the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said. As part of the agreement, armoured vehicles and long-range artillery will be sent. France’s military intelligence chief Gen Eric Vidaud is leaving his post after Paris failed to accurately predict – in contrast with western allies – that Russia would launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, several sources with knowledge of his exit have said.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 37 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-37-of-the-russian-invasion
4/1/2022,"On International Transgender Day of Visibility, Ariana Grande is using her star power to rally her millions of fans to support trans youth. In an Instagram post on Thursday, the pop star announced the Protect & Defend Trans Youth Fund, which she founded with the fundraising platform Pledge. “Right now there are hundreds of disgraceful bills pending in state legislature that target trans youth and aim to curb their rights,” Grande wrote in the post to her 302 million followers, saying the project would provide “critical funds” to organizations “providing direct services and advocating for the rights of trans youth.” The singer said she would match donations up to $1.5m. The money will be evenly divided among 18 groups including the Black Trans Advocacy Coalition, Equality Florida, and Jasmyn. “Today we are going to raise $3m for trans-led work,” wrote the ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio on Twitter. “Ariana Grande is matching up to $1.5m. We are going to make #TDOV about action, investment and power.” Here is what is going to happen. Today we are going to raise $3million for trans-led work. Ariana Grande is matching up to $1.5million. We are going to make #TDOV about action, investment and power. Go here, donate, share. https://t.co/kTn01fk61o The fund had raised more than $300,000 as of Thursday evening. Grande’s announcement comes as states across the US advance legislation targeting trans rights. On Wednesday, Arizona’s governor, Doug Ducey, signed two bills affecting trans youth – one restricting access to gender-affirming healthcare, and the other banning trans girls at some schools from playing on sports teams that match their gender. Oklahoma’s governor signed a similar sports bill on the same day. The two states joined a dozen others that have imposed parallel measures on trans participation in sports. Twenty states have introduced legislation opposing gender-affirming healthcare for youth in 2022, according to Equality Federation. This year has seen almost 240 state bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights, NBC News reported. A Texas judge this month temporarily halted a state measure that would label parents’ provision of gender-affirming healthcare to their children as “child abuse”. And in Florida this week, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a “don’t say gay” bill banning teaching about sexual orientation and gender identity to children in kindergarten through third grade. Amid the torrent of discrimination, Joe Biden issued a proclamation on Thursday highlighting new policy moves to support trans people in the US. The measures include efforts to support trans youth mental health and bolster access to government services. “To transgender Americans of all ages, I want you to know that you are so brave,” Biden wrote. “You belong. I have your back.”",Arts/Music,Ariana Grande giving $1.5m to support trans youth amid ‘disgraceful’ legislative attacks,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/31/ariana-grande-transgender-youth-rights
4/1/2022,"After a weeks-long illegal occupation that ended in a riot, New Zealand’s parliament has a new unwelcome visitor to contend with: cannabis seedlings popping up among its rose gardens. An eagle-eyed Wellingtonian spotted the tiny green leaves emerging from the soil this week and posted his find to social media. The man wished to remain anonymous, but a parliament groundskeeper confirmed to the national broadcaster, RNZ, that the plants were indeed “a few cannabis seedlings” thought to be left by the protesters. “A lot of seeds had been scattered around, among other things left from the protesters,” the groundskeeper said. A security guard added that it was “probably the first cannabis that has ever been planted on parliament grounds”. A protester who had returned to the site told RNZ that the protesters were responsible for scattering the seeds and “many more will likely germinate for years to come”. The plants, which are illegal in New Zealand, have since been pulled out and destroyed after the speaker of the house, Trevor Mallard, asked “for the weed to be weeded”. The 23-day protest on Wellington’s parliament grounds was nominally about opposition to vaccine mandates, but was blighted by conspiracy theories, death threats, abusive behaviour and a riot that ended in violence and fires. The grounds were left muddied and charred by campers, who also tore up parts of the established gardens to plant herbs, vegetables and, it turns out, cannabis. Following weeks of peace, high fences were erected around the grounds and the police presence upped again on Friday morning, after a new group said they would begin another 14 days of action to demand an end to all Covid-19 restrictions. Two weeks ago, the government announced it would end some vaccine-mandates and the requirement for vaccine passes from 4 April. However, one protester, Tessa Jefferis, told RNZ: “There’ll be protest action until we, first, get an acknowledgment. Second, we get an apology. Third, we get justice. And fourth … personally, I’m not stopping until the Covid-19 Health Response Act legislation is obliterated.”",News/World news,Cannabis sprouts in New Zealand parliament garden in protesters’ parting pot-shot,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/cannabis-sprouts-in-new-zealand-parliament-garden-in-protesters-parting-pot-shot
