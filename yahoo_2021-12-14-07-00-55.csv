12/14/2021,"With inflation rates surging at rates not seen in decades, many consumers are wondering how to keep rising prices from negatively affecting their savings and spending habits.  Prices on consumer goods and services including food, energy, and housing have been rising for the last few months. They jumped again in November, rising to 6.8% over the previous year, according to the latest consumer price index data released Friday.  Along with rising prices this year, there have also been supply chain bottlenecks and rising consumer demand—all of which can cause real challenges as the average American’s purchasing power degrades over time. While the effects of inflation are not easily avoided, several financial planners tell Fortune that there are steps consumers can take to duck the worst effects.  Putting off a major purchase may be the right option now, especially on a new car, says Jay Zigmont, a certified financial planner (CFP) and founder of Mississippi-based financial firm Live, Learn, Plan. “If your car works and gets you to work, then stick with it,” he says.  That’s because while auto loan rates are low, the cost of new cars have surged 11.1% over the past year, according to the Consumer Price Index. But inflation on used cars is even worse—up 31.4% over the past year.  Zigmont says in general, car prices have gotten a “bit disconnected from reality” and consumers need to ask themselves if they really need a new car right now. “Try paying for a complete detailing of your car and it will feel new to you without the sticker shock,” he says. For those with car leases running out in the next few months, financial planner Chris Diodato says it may be worth buying out the lease rather than shopping around for a new car or lease. Buyout prices, which are indicated on the initial lease contract, have been far below current resale value, says Diodato, a CFP and founder of Florida-based WELLth Financial Planning.  One thing that makes inflation particularly difficult for savers is the low-interest rate environment that the U.S. has been experiencing, says Matt Elliott, a CFP and founder of Minnesota-based Pulse Financial Planning. “Your cash at the bank makes close to no interest, yet prices are increasing on everything you buy. That can cause your purchasing power to degrade over time if you aren’t invested,” Elliott says.  He recommends consumers consider investing in a diversified portfolio that includes investments that will go up with inflation, such as Series I savings bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). I bonds, for example, currently offer an interest rate increase to 7.12% though April 2022.  Yet while the interest rate on Series I bonds is attractive, financial planner Jovan Johnson says investors need to put in the work to understand how these work and how that can impact their timeline for this money.  For instance, investors are generally limited to buying $10,000 of I bonds annually, per person and you can’t sell these bonds for at least 12 months. If you redeem them in less than five years, then you’ll forfeit 3 months of interest, Jovan, a CFP and owner of Georgia-based Piece of Wealth Planning. “Overall, I believe that I Bonds are a very secure and great place to park your money if you don't need this money for at least 1 year,” he adds.  “Many young people sit with lots of extra cash as they are unsure what to do with it, but that can be harmful now,” says Thomas Kopelman, co-founder of Indiana-based AllStreet Wealth. “You should only have cash for an emergency fund, as well as cash for short-term goals (vacation, down payment of house, etc), then you need to invest the rest.” More than any other strategy, financial planner Elliott Appel, recommends shifting what you buy from items that are highly-impacted by inflation, to items that have escaped the worst of it. “Not all items have seen the same rate of inflation,” adds Appel, a CFP and founder of Wisconsin-based Kindness Financial Planning.  Most consumers, for instance, have noticed grocery bills going up, but much of those cost increases are tied to rising prices for animal-derived products, says Andy Baxley, an Illinois-based CFP with The Planning Center. “Experimenting with plant-based dishes is one way to reduce pain at the checkout counter. I am encouraging folks to get creative with their budgets right now,” he says.  Or maybe instead of buying beef, buy chicken. Beef prices have risen 20.9% in the last 12 months, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. Chicken prices only increased 9.2% over the past year and the cost of other uncooked poultry products, including turkey is up only 4.6%. Meanwhile shelf-stable fish and seafood such as canned tuna hasn't seen any increases. “You can research what's gone up the most over the past year and perhaps buy less of it,” Appel says.  This is a good time to reconsider your overall spending, says Dana Menard, a CFP and founder of Minnesota-based Twin Cities Wealth Strategies.  “When necessities begin to cost more, discretionary spending should be reevaluated so as to not neglect the things that are necessary,” he says.  This may be as simple as getting rid of or canceling unused subscriptions, but Menard says it’s important to consider where and how you're spending your money. That's especially true around the holidays, when people make impulsive purchases, and gift-buying can sometimes trump logic. Although it might not be easy to make these changes right now, Elliott says the good news is that many financial experts and economists predict the current rates of high inflation will start to subside. “While heightened inflation could be temporary, it may be best to hope for the best, but prepare your finances in case we see sustained inflation over the longer term.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•4 hours ago,Here’s what 8 financial planners say you should do with your money during inflation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-financial-planners-money-during-181740129.html
12/14/2021,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's biggest conglomerate Vingroup said on Sunday it had started building a $174 million battery cell plant for its VinFast electric vehicles business so the company can own its battery supply chain. VinFast became the country's first fully fledged domestic car manufacturer when its gasoline-powered models built under its own badge hit the streets in 2019. It is betting on the U.S. market, where its electric SUVs and a battery leasing model are expected to make their debut next year. The battery plant, Vietnam's first EV battery project is located in central province of Ha Tinh, on a 8-hectare (20 acre) plot. In October, the Ha Tinh local authorities said plant was expected to be a $387 million investment and on a 12.6 hectare plot. ""This is in the focus of VinFast's localisation strategy of supply,"" said Thai Thi Thanh Hai, vice chair of Vingroup and vice-chair of the board of VinFast. ""The strategy enables us to own our supply chain of batteries and parts."" The company said it is looking to produce 100,000 battery packs per year in a first phase and then upgrade its capacity to one million. It did not elaborate on the project's time frame in detail but based on the October's report, the project would run at full capacity from 2025. VinFast is working with a variety of partners for batteries, including StoreDot, Gotion High-Tech and ProLogium and is also focusing on internal R&D and is establishing research facilities to develop battery and charging technologies, the company has previously said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Last week, Vingroup said it was looking to list in the United States in the second half of next year.

12/14/2021,"GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) stocks slid on Monday closing down nearly 14% and 15%, respectively. The pressure on shares of both the video game retailer and cinema chain operator follow recent weekly declines for the flagship meme stocks favored by retail traders.  AMC shares were trading as low as 16% during the afternoon session on Monday, adding to its loss on Friday of nearly 7%. GameStop's stock was down 13% midday. Meme stocks have been in a downward trend over the last month amid broader market volatility and a lower appetite for risky assets.  Still, year-to-date, GameStop is up 645%, while AMC is up over 1000%, and retail investors are buying the dip. Orders by retail customers on Fidelity shows AMC and GME as two of the top 10 trades, with more Buy than Sell orders.  GameStop shares came under pressure, falling as much as 10% during one session after its quarterly results earlier this month. A lack of details over the company's digital strategy may have been weighing on investors.  Meanwhile in November, AMC announced that domestic and international ticket sales in October were stronger than in any month since the start of the pandemic in 2020.  The company's quarterly revenue on November 8 beat Wall Street estimates. During AMC's earnings call, CEO Adam Aron said he would be selling some of his shares, citing estate planning.  Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Flipboard, and LinkedIn",Business/Yahoo Finance•1 hour ago,"GME, AMC down as meme stocks stumble",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gme-amc-down-as-meme-stocks-stumble-205311533.html
12/14/2021,"Based on the comparison between the Percentage of stocks above 200-Day average and the SPX for the past 10 years, the divergence happened since Feb 2021 as the SPX continue to trend higher, the number of stocks participated in the uptrend is getting lesser, deteriorated from 90% to 42% as of last Friday since Feb 2021. In fact, many growth stocks such as Affirm Holdings (AFRM), CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Fiverr International (FVRR), MercadoLibre (MELI), Sea (SE), Twilio (TWLO), DocuSign (DOCU), Roku (ROKU), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), etc…experienced big drawdowns range from 32%-65% from their all time high. There are only a handful of outperforming stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM), etc… supporting the S&P 500 index. The divergence between the SPX and the stock market breadth are certainly not a healthy sign for the bull market especially it has been persisting for nearly 10 months. It might only take a few early capitulations from the funds to trigger a broad market sell-off when the market is at the vulnerable point. It can be noticed from the chart that 50% level is a support. When the percentage of stocks above 200-Day average dropped below 50%, there was a relatively sharp sell-off in SPX, as highlighted in orange color in 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2018. The market breadth is often acted as a leading indicator before the damage hits the SPX. S&P 500 did have a rally after an oversold condition at the support area while there was presence of demand as pointed in last week’s article. Detailed analysis can be found by watching the price volume analysis for the market outlook on YouTube. As shown in the screenshot on 8 Dec from my private Telegram Group for Mastering Price Action Trading course above, the four US major indices – S&P 500 (SPX), Dow Jones (DJI), Nasdaq (IXIC) and Russell 2000 (RUT) are likely in a consolidation with high volatility to both sides. It is obvious that there was an increase of supply on the down wave since Black Friday selloff, which is yet to be tested. As S&P 500 approaches the resistance zone at 4700, it could be vulnerable for a correction when the sellers step in to lock in profit or initiate short positions. Should a correction happen, the previous swing low near 4500 is a natural area for buyers to step in for bargain hunting. It is critical to judge the supply level together with the characteristics of the price action (spread and velocity) to anticipate next move. For a bearish scenario, watch out for a Wyckoff up thrust (false breakout) with increasing supply followed by a break below 4650. For bullish case, S&P 500 needs to commit above the resistance level at 4720. Based on the market breadth and the Wyckoff phase analysis on SPX, a trading range between 4500-4700 is expected. There could be other headwind ahead such as Fed’s tapering of the bond-buying program and an urgency for interest rate hike, which I will be discussing in my weekly live session on Sunday.
