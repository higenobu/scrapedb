2/11/2022,"For Olivier Bancoult of the Chagos Refugee Group, it was the sight of two skuas gliding over the waves that heralded long promised landfall on his native islands. During the first three days of the voyage out from the Seychelles there had been remarkably few seabirds until the Mauritian-chartered Bleu De Nîmes, a cruise ship converted from its former use as a British minesweeper, neared the Chagos Islands.  Excitement began to build among the exiled Chagossians returning to their homeland. They played music on the quarterdeck. “I will be free,” said Rosemonde Bertin, throwing up her arms in anticipation of stepping ashore on Salomon Island where she was born 67 years ago. The captain sounded the ship’s horn as the vessel crossed into waters that the UK claims as British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), despite the United Nations having confirmed three years ago that the area legally belongs to Mauritius. On the top deck, the Chagossians danced and sang in gentle, warm rain, raising glasses of champagne beside two open-air hot tubs. After repeated recalculations of tides and headwinds, the ship was expecting to anchor on Saturday afternoon (local time) off Peros Banhos. The Chagossians will be among the first to set foot on the island. They intend to plant a Mauritian flag and their own orange, black and blue Chagos banner – symbolising the sunset glowing when they were deported by British-chartered boats fifty years ago, the dark years of their exile and the blue ocean. Flowers will be laid in the overgrown cemetery on the island where their ancestors lie. One photograph that has infuriated the exiles is of the studiously, well-kept military animal graveyard on the UK/US base on nearby Diego Garcia. The decay of their families’ cemetery on Peros Banhos seems cruel by comparison. The voyage’s main scientific purpose is to place underwater tide gauges on the sea floor on the outlying Blenheim Reef. That is likely to be done early on Sunday. The devices will measure sea levels and enable Swedish experts on the ship to calculate whether any of the reef remains above water at what is known as “highest astronomical tide”. Ola Oskarsson, a marine surveyor retained by Mauritius, is leading the project. If he finds that any part of Blenheim Reef – even a small rock or shingle beach – stays dry all the time, then that can be used as a new outer base point for extending a 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in legal argument under the UN convention on the law of the sea. The work, to resolve maritime boundaries with neighbouring Maldives, is being undertaken by Mauritius in the expectation that it will at some point regain control of the Chagos Islands from the UK. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has promised “it would not interrupt the survey”. Whether Mauritian activity and landings within what is claimed as BIOT will be monitored by British officials is unclear. In Mauritius itself, there has been media criticism of the cost of the expedition and complaints that not enough Mauritian journalists were invited on to the ship. The strangest fact to emerge during the voyage, however, is that the seas around the Chagos archipelago are almost 100-metres below average sea levels elsewhere around the globe. That extraordinary, marine feature is due to the Earth not being a perfect sphere but more like a lumpy potato. Different densities inside our planet cause fluctuations in gravity, which affect the behaviour of the oceans. “Mean sea level is not constant,” explained Oskarsson. “It’s undulating because of gravity. Water shifts to even out irregularities.” The Chagos Islands are on a slope that bottoms out at the Maldives.",News/World news,‘I will be free’: excitement grows as cruise ship nears Chagos Islands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/i-will-be-free-excitement-grows-as-cruise-ship-nears-chagos-islands
2/11/2022,"When Little Simz invited her mum on stage to help collect her Brit award for best new artist this week, it quickly became the evening’s standout moment. “Look at what you’ve done, Mum!” she told her, kicking off a powerful acceptance speech that turned her journey from council estate to awards ceremony podium into an inspirational allegory. The 27-year-old said she was “living proof that if you work hard at something, no matter where you come from, your background, your race, you can be something extraordinary”. Yet fans of the rapper were confused by the prize for new artists. Having released her debut mixtape in 2010, Simz now has four critically lauded albums under her belt, including last year’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, a thought-provoking and utterly unique record that earned many five-star reviews and was widely considered a new high-water mark for British rap. It reached No 4 in the UK albums chart, the accomplishment that earned her Brit nomination – artists must have had a Top 40 album or two Top 20 singles to qualify. Before that, she had been endorsed by huge stars including Kendrick Lamar and Stormzy. In other words, the north Londoner, born Simbiatu Ajikawo, is far from a fledgling talent.  It wasn’t solely her powerful speech, nor her mum, that made this year’s Brits Simz’s night. Her spectacular performance also provided the musical peak, with Simz outshining Ed Sheeran and Adele. She performed two recent singles: the imperious Introvert, in which she was held aloft by swathes of dancers, and the gleefully groovy Woman, a celebration of Black womanhood. In between was a spoken-word interlude from Emma Corrin, AKA The Crown’s Diana, Princess of Wales, who also appears on the album. Other artists were keen to congratulate Simz when picking up their own awards: Dave, who took home the best hip-hop/rap/grime prize, said he was “so proud” of the musician, while Adele wished her “a massive congratulations”. Adele’s crowd-pleasing balladry and Simz’s uncompromising hip-hop may seem worlds apart, but they have something crucial in common. Both have drawn on the talents of the producer Inflo, leader of the mysterious musical collective Sault and the winner, unsurprisingly, of the Brit award for producer of the year. Simz grew up with her Nigerian mother, a foster carer, in Islington, north London, and attended school in nearby Highbury. It was at Mary’s Youth Club – where she first met Inflo – that her talents for music and dance were nurtured. The youth centre has been described by Simz as “the place where it all began for me … a second home”. Aston Wood, who runs the youth club, says Mary’s provides a “safe space for young people to hang out and have fun”, particularly those without the money to afford other leisure activities. It also helps students fulfil their ambitions by connecting them with otherwise inaccessible opportunities and by introducing them to “other adults that could inspire them”. Following her Brits win, Simz is one of them. “It’s really helpful for us to be able to speak about Simbi and how hard she worked when she was at the youth club and the years after,” says Wood. “Our young people can relate to her. We can say she did it and you can too.” Simz also met the actor Letitia Wright at Mary’s – the star of Marvel’s Black Panther who also appeared in Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror. The pair have remained close friends and collaborators: in 2019, Simz photographed Wright for the artwork for her single Selfish. Wright says she has been a fan of her friend’s music “since I was a teenager. Her growth, dedication to the craft and impact through her talent is beautiful to witness.” Simz, too, initially found success as an actor. At 16, she starred on the BBC children’s fantasy series Spirit Warriors; three years later she appeared in Youngers, an E4 comedy-drama about a group of aspiring musicians. Acting is still an important element of her career: in 2019 she played the carer Shelley in the Drake-assisted Netflix reboot of the organised-crime drama Top Boy. She will reprise her role when the show returns in March. Ronan Bennett, Top Boy’s creator and writer, cites Simz’s “stillness, poise and integrity” as key to her success in the role – qualities familiar to fans of her thoughtful, idiosyncratic music. The series, a naturalistic depiction of life on a Hackney estate, has been lauded for its subtle, realistic performances. It is also known for its ensemble cast, featuring the rappers Kano and Dave. Bennett describes Simz as “quietly confident and good with directors and her fellow cast. She doesn’t have to try to project or impose herself in a scene. She’s there, and you can’t miss her.” While Simz is clearly multi-talented, music is her primary form of self-expression. In 2015, she released her debut album, A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons. Sonically ambitious and lyrically dense, it would set the tone for Simz’s eccentric, genre-bending future output. Other artists quickly began to take notice: in 2016 she was picked as tour support by Lauryn Hill. The following year, Kendrick Lamar called her “the illest doing it right now”. In 2019, Stormzy – who had collaborated with her years before and guested during her live shows – said she was a “legend”. Despite her embrace by the rap scene at large, Little Simz’s individuality has nonetheless resisted categorisation. She prefers to recount the intricacy of her inner monologue than embrace the humour and sexualisation of rap’s biggest female stars. And although affiliated with grime, her work ventures beyond the genre’s austere sound, taking reggae, blues, video game soundtracks, synth-rock and jazzy R&B. But like many of her UK rap peers, Simz has resisted signing to a label, releasing her music through her own Age 101 records. This staunch independence and singularity – coupled with the fact that British female rappers have long struggled to find commercial success on home turf – may be why Simz’s rise has been so protracted. But there is an upside: the long haul has allowed her to hone her craft and cement her identity, making her perfectly primed for mainstream success.",Arts/Music,Little Simz’s long path from council estate to Brit awards podium,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/little-simzs-long-path-from-council-estate-to-brit-awards-podium
2/11/2022,"My husband is one of four, and they all have children of their own. His parents divorced when he was young after his father had a long-standing affair with a woman he went on to marry. My mother-in-law was left worse off, while my father-in-law has gone on to live a fairly charmed life.She is still white-hot angry with her ex-husband and his now wife. She can’t bear to speak their names and we all go to a lot of effort to ensure they never cross paths. There have been times when she has stopped speaking to members of the family if she feels they have had anything to do with her ex and his wife. We’re a very close family, and I feel so lucky to have a mother-in-law who is devoted to my children. She’s the first we call in a crisis and we all see each other more than weekly.  Recently, she has been upset by her ex-husband attempting to muscle in on her and her family. No amount of reassurance seems to help. We can see this is all coming from a place of pain; she’s stuck in a cycle of anger and injustice and we don’t know how to break it. I am so worried that this will break up the family for good. All four of the siblings are losing sleep over this, and I’d love to help.  I can sense so clearly how, in wanting to keep your mother-in-law happy, you are all treading on eggshells. This is never a sustainable or relaxing option. And for her children and grandchildren, not seeing their father/grandfather if they want to is not an acceptable option. Psychotherapist Armele Philpotts (bacp.org.uk) and I had a long talk about your letter. We wondered what those “reassurances” you show your MIL look like? It can be easy to feel like we are reassuring someone when we may actually be shushing them, especially in response to family stories we sense we’ve heard before. I’m aware your husband and his siblings were very young when this happened, so there must be pain for them too, and maybe they learned to shush that away (or that mother’s pain was more important). Maybe no one has really seen or validated your MIL’s pain? Philpotts also explained how “anger is a good thing because it tells us that a boundary has been crossed; it’s really about figuring out which one”. In this case it’s pretty clear it’s the affair that has made your MIL so angry. “And it now seems like she is trying to hold a boundary by not talking about, or acknowledging, her ex and his wife,” she added. I wondered if your MIL feels that “having” the family is her recompense for what she lost, and this is why she feels so fiercely possessive of you all. Maybe she thinks it’s unfair of your FIL to have done what he did, have the “charmed life” and have his family. I also wasn’t sure what the set-up was – do you all see your FIL and his wife, but don’t tell her? “If you’re all going about it in a cloak-and-dagger way to protect her, that may replicate the secrecy of the affair,” said Philpotts, which may make her feel duped again. Philpotts wondered if it was coming to a head because some of her grandchildren are nearing the age her own children were at the time of the divorce? We wondered if there could be a time and a place where one of you, maybe the person she finds it easiest to talk to, could broach it with her and say something like: “We can see how much this hurts you, if you ever want to talk about the pain, we’re here for you, but we don’t want to have to hide things from you or lie to you, so how can we manage this?” Ask yourself this: if you’re constantly trying to keep the peace, do you actually have any peace?

2/11/2022,"Pink fizz is such a Valentine’s Day cliche, but sometimes cliches are cliches for good reason. And, these days, pink wine deserves to be taken seriously, whether it’s sparkling or still. That’s certainly reflected in the price of most rosé champagne, which is almost invariably more expensive than its colourless counterparts – in the case of Krug, a whopping 250 quid, and that’s on special offer at Ocado. When you ask why, there’s usually a lot of mumbo-jumbo spoken about the skill involved in blending, and how it’s more expensive to make, yadda yadda yadda, but it’s hard to see quite what justifies the size of such a premium, other than that they can simply get away with it. Unlike rosé, which is generally made from lightly pressed red grapes, pink fizz is made by adding a small amount of red wine, generally pinot noir, to a white wine base. As well as champagne, there are some particularly pretty examples in the UK, including Digby’s Leander Pink and the Woodchester Valley Brut Rosé I recommended a couple of weeks ago, though neither of those is inexpensive, either.  The good news, however, is that there is some great-value pink bubbly around: rosé prosecco, which was relatively recently approved as a denomination, cava rosado and crémant are all affordable and, in the case of prosecco, which doesn’t have much flavour of its own, usually preferable to the standard version. Cava, which is also less dry and fruitier than champagne, deserves a revisit, too. You can also cut the cost by popping the cork on a half-bottle rather than a full-sized one. Exton Park (see today’s pick) is one of the few English sparkling wine producers to do one – let’s have more, please – but if you want your loved one to know you’re spoiling them, there’s always Bollinger, whose half-bottles of rosé are currently on sale at Waitrose at £28, with the full bottles on offer at £39, should you feel like splashing out. You’ll easily pay more elsewhere. The other advantage of pink fizz is that it goes with such a wide range of Valentine’s Day food. Smoked salmon, sushi (with which it’s particularly good), lobster, heart-shaped cheeses such as coeur de Neufchâtel, white chocolate, macarons … Even a packet of prawn crackers, which is maybe all you’ll get round to eating. So, even if you’re not celebrating V Day, take advantage of the special offers and stock up for spring drinking. Happily, that’s not that far away now. La Gioiosa Prosecco Rosé 2020 £8.99 (on offer) Waitrose, £10 Tesco (or £8 for Clubcard members), £9.99 (on mix-six) Majestic, 11%. One of the best rosé proseccos I’ve tasted, certainly at this price. A cocktail of summer fruits. Roche Lacour Crémant de Limoux Rosé Brut 2019 £15.49 (or £13.89 by the mixed case) Laithwaites, 12.5%. Pretty bottle, pretty fruit in this attractive pink fizz from the south of France. Exton Park RB 23 Rosé £25 a half-bottle extonparkvineyard.com, £40 a full-size bottle Highbury Vintners, 11.5%. Stocked at Simon Rogan’s and other top Michelin restaurants, this lovely rosé has a touch of white peach. You can pick it up from the vineyard, if you live near Hampshire. Laurent Perrier Rosé Champagne £59.99 (on mix-six) Majestic, 12%. Bit spendy, but probably cheaper than going out to dinner. And it’s widely available. Roebuck Estates Rosé de Noirs 2016 £42 roebuckestates.co.uk, £42.50 Hennings Wine, 12%. Delicate, summery, red berry fruit, like freshly picked raspberries and redcurrants.

2/11/2022,"When I was 16, I asked my best friend, Kerry, why she was so into piercings. Because I was young, naive and suburban, I did slightly subscribe to the “you’d be so pretty if you didn’t have all that metal in your face” attitude – echoing my mother, probably. Kerry explained that she refused to let her body be arbitrary. At the time, I didn’t know fully what “arbitrary” meant, but I did not want to appear dense, so I waited until I got home to look it up. For the most part, our bodies are arbitrary. We get the body we get at birth: our eye colour, our hair colour, our skin colour. We have no say in those things at the moment we are born but, talking to my friend, I realised that subsequent changes are within our grasp. We can go against the grain. My first act of defiance came in 1999, when I bleached my hair. Rather than platinum blonde, it turned the colour of Berocca piss. I quickly dyed it fire engine red instead; why would I want to look like my peers when I could look like Ginger Spice?  Later, in my 20s, dissatisfied with my body, I went further. I threw myself into health and fitness, and got my first nose job. It made me feel like my body belonged to me – not the other way around. I could harness and shape it as I saw fit. By the time I confronted my gender identity, I was almost 30. One of the big transphobic “gotchas” is that transgender people are somehow unaware of basic biology: we are thick, confused or deluded, if you believe a certain subsection of Twitter. On the contrary, it was my relationship between self and body that told me that I was a trans woman. I was painfully aware of the body I had, but I learned – eventually – that I didn’t have to accept it. None of us are beholden to our bodies. That is not to say that our bodies aren’t vital; they are. Being a woman – cisgender or trans – can feel like you are being set up to fail from the start, and our bodies often affect how well we are able to function within society. But I believe in individual bodily autonomy; a refusal to let the system predetermine or limit your choices is one of the ways we attack patriarchal structures. Although the physical transformations I have made have increased my sense of self-ownership and self-worth, I have remained the same person, on a fundamental human level. With each act of bodily rebellion – some superficial, some life-changing – I have preferred my exterior, but it is not the greatest source of joy in my life. The interior – call it consciousness, soul, self or personality – has remained consistently me, and it’s that part that has experienced love and contentment, heartache and despair. If my body is a vessel, I am its captain. Juno Dawson is a writer and activist",Lifestyle/Life and style,Living in a woman’s body: my body belongs to me.

2/11/2022,"There was a moment last Sunday morning when the size of the opportunity rugby league is presented with this weekend hit home. Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch is not usually the first place you would look for a chat about rugby league, but when Adam Hills seized the chance to champion the channel’s coverage of Super League in 2022, it became obvious what a defining moment this is for a sport which has constantly courted mainstream attention. Rugby league is, of course, no stranger to free-to-air coverage with the BBC’s long-standing coverage of the Challenge Cup, plus the fact this autumn’s World Cup will be on terrestrial television. But for the first time in its history, Super League will be shown live in front of a bigger audience than ever before on Saturday afternoon when Channel 4 screens the first of its 20-game commitment across the next two seasons as Leeds Rhinos host Warrington Wolves.  “I’m hopeful we can take this sport to a broader audience,” says Channel 4’s head of sport, Pete Andrews. Sky Sports had held a monopoly on Super League coverage since the competition began in 1996, which is why for those associated with the game, this truly feels like a watershed moment. The goal for Andrews and Channel 4 is to satisfy ardent rugby league fans while, perhaps more importantly, hooking in new fans. “That’s the tightrope we’re walking,” he says. “We don’t want to annoy the existing fans but we have to strike the right tone with potential new audiences too.” Channel 4’s determination to make their product different to Sky or the BBC is underlined by the appointment of Hills as host presenter. Hills, known for presenting The Last Leg and Channel 4’s coverage of the Paralympics, is a boyhood rugby league fan, while he also represents Warrington’s physical disability side as a player. “I want to convey the joy I get from watching rugby league but we’re going to make it cooler,” Hills says. “We’re thinking of doing things like getting celebrities who‘ve never experienced rugby league before to experience it. We also want closet rugby league fans to come out of that closet. But Channel 4 will be trying to give it an edge like we have done with our coverage of the Paralympics.” Free-to-air television has the ability to boost a sport’s reputation and standing like nothing else. Cricket can attest to that, with the boom in popularity from the 2005 Ashes series and the 2019 World Cup final, both of which were on Channel 4. “It’s remarkable Super League hasn’t been on terrestrial television before,” Andrews says. “We’ve found rugby league to be very inclusive and it fits with a lot of Channel 4’s values. We can’t wait to get started.” The broadcaster has committed to 10 games a season for the next two years, which takes the sport through to the end of its long-standing and lucrative contract with Sky. Saturday is a seminal moment for the sport’s immediate future with the prospect of more people than ever before watching Super League, but it also creates a new dynamic for the competition to consider long-term instead of renewing with Sky. Channel 4 have called on the former Great Britain international Leon Pryce to add insight to their coverage, and the enormity of the occasion is not lost on those directly involved in the game. “We’re really privileged and really proud to be involved,” the Leeds coach, Richard Agar, says. “It’s an awesome opportunity for the sport. We want to get out there and really put a show on. I just hope I can go home Saturday night and watch it knowing we’ve delivered a good performance.” With Hills as lead presenter, there is also scope for crossover too, which is arguably the most exciting aspect of this new venture. The Last Leg, Sunday Brunch and many other Channel 4 shows will now mention rugby league for the first time; in terms of profile building, there has never been a moment like this. “To talk about rugby league to people who may not know it, that’s exciting,” Hills says. “But there’s also a hell of a lot of pressure. Channel 4 want to find a way of opening rugby league up to a new audience. We want to show everyone about this secret and showcase rugby league to the world.”",Sport/Sport,Rugby league targets its own Ashes moment with switch to Channel 4,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/rugby-league-targets-its-own-ashes-moment-with-switch-to-channel-4
2/11/2022,"Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Friday releasing $7bn in frozen Afghan reserves to be split between humanitarian efforts for the Afghan people and American victims of terrorism, including relatives of 9/11. In a highly unusual move, the convoluted plan is designed to tackle a myriad of legal bottlenecks stemming from the 2001 terrorist attacks and the chaotic end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan, which ignited a humanitarian and political crisis, the New York times reports.  The elected Afghan government was dissolved in August after the Taliban seized control, leaving behind just over $7bn in central bank assets deposited in the US Federal Reserve bank in New York. As Afghanistan’s top elected officials, including the president and central bank governor, fled the country, the Fed froze the account as it was unclear who was legally authorised to access the funds. The Taliban took over the central bank – known as Da Afghanistan Bank – and immediately claimed a right to the money, but under longstanding counter-terrorism sanctions it is illegal to engage in financial transactions with the organisation. Furthermore, the US does not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. As the Biden administration mulled over what to do with the funds, a group of relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks, who years ago won a default judgment against the Taliban and al-Qaida, sought to seize the Afghan bank assets. In a case known as Havlish, the plaintiffs persuaded a judge to dispatch a US marshal to serve the Federal Reserve with a “writ of execution” to seize the Afghan money. The Biden government has intervened in the lawsuit, and is expected to tell the court that the victims’ claims for half the money should be heard (several other victims’ groups have also asked for a share). If the judge agrees, Biden will seek to direct the remainder toward some sort of trust fund to be spent on food and other humanitarian aid in Afghanistan – while keeping it out of the hands of the Taliban. The process is likely to be long and messy, with advocates and some 9/11 victims arguing that the Afghan assets should all go to help the Afghan people who are facing mounting hardship. The money – which includes currency, bonds and gold – mostly comes from foreign exchange funds that accumulated over the past two decades when western aid flowed into Afghanistan. But it also includes the savings of ordinary Afghans, who are now facing growing violence and hunger with the economy and rule of law in freefall.",News/World news,Biden expected to order $7bn in frozen reserves go to 9/11 families and Afghan aid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/biden-7bn-frozen-afghan-reserves-taliban
2/11/2022,"Palmeiras fans have been out in force in Abu Dhabi this week. They have travelled thousands of miles to watch the Club World Cup and have been showing their colours with pride before Abel Ferreira’s side take on Chelsea, who will be making a big mistake if they show any complacency during Saturday night’s final at the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium. This is a huge moment for Palmeiras; a chance, at long last, to silence taunts from rival Brazilian clubs about their barren record in this tournament. The Copa Libertadores champions understand what is at stake. They have long since had to accept that their triumph in the Copa Rio in 1951, the original intercontinental club tournament, is not enough to stop the chants of “Palmeiras não tem Mundial” – Palmeiras don’t have a World Cup – from fans of Corinthians, São Paulo and Santos. There is only one way to scratch the itch: by defying the odds and dashing Chelsea’s hopes of becoming world champions for the first time.  History is on the line. This is the only major trophy that has eluded Chelsea during the Roman Abramovich era and the European champions do not need to be told how seriously this competition is taken in Brazil. They were beaten finalists when they faced Corinthians in 2012 and they know that Palmeiras’s fans are going to turn the stadium green. “Palmeiras are huge,” Thiago Silva, Chelsea’s Brazilian centre-back, said. “We know that with the presence of fans here, their team is much stronger.” It is not going to be straightforward, especially as Chelsea still do not know whether Thomas Tuchel will be at the final. Tuchel had to stay in London after testing positive for Covid-19 last week, but Chelsea could do with him on the touchline. They did not convince when they beat Al-Hilal 1-0 on Wednesday and will be in trouble if there is no improvement against Palmeiras, who were comfortable 2-0 winners against Al-Ahly in the other semi-final. “It is unfortunate Thomas was not here but we hope he will join us,” Jorginho, Chelsea’s vice-captain, said. “It gives you more because he is your coach and there is more energy in the changing room.” In the absence of Tuchel it has been up to the German’s assistants, Zsolt Low and Arno Michels, to take charge. The backroom team have had to take on more responsibility. Anthony Barry and Benjamin Weber were both talked up by Jorginho and there has also been help from Petr Cech, Chelsea’s technical and performance adviser. Cech has plenty of experience to offer Tuchel’s squad. He was in goal when Chelsea lost to Corinthians in Japan just over nine years ago and the memory eats away at him. These opportunities do not come around often and Cech has been telling this generation not to fly home with regrets. The issue is that this tournament is still not taken entirely seriously by European teams. It is often viewed as an inconvenience, an unwanted interruption in the middle of a domestic campaign, but that can level the playing field and give hope to the underdogs. Chelsea certainly had the wrong attitude on the only other occasion when they were Europe’s representatives in the Club World Cup. Too many of Rafael Benítez’s players were unhappy with the quality of their hotel and the negativity affected their performance, Corinthians winning 1-0 thanks to a goal from Paolo Guerrero. It has to be different this time. Chelsea are staying in a plush hotel, the sun is shining and there were concerns that it would feel like a pre-season tour when they landed in Abu Dhabi. Would the intensity be there? Or would the players see it as a chance to relax after a taxing winter period? It has not been an easy few months for Chelsea. Injuries have disrupted their momentum, their title challenge has faded away and Romelu Lukaku still looks unconvincing. This, though, is a chance to lift the mood. Lukaku scored against Al-Hilal, Kepa Arrizabalaga made two brilliant saves and the sense in the coaching team is that the players understand what it would mean to become world champions. Palmeiras, who have won back-to-back Copa Libertadores titles, are not to be taken lightly. Tuchel, who does not want to leave anything to chance, is considering whether to bring Édouard Mendy in for Arrizabalaga. Mason Mount and N’Golo Kanté could also return to the starting lineup and the message from Jorginho was that anything could happen. Palmeiras, who lost in the semi-finals last year, are going to be up for it. Chelsea must be ready.",Sport/Football,Chelsea must learn lesson to silence Palmeiras and claim first world title,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/11/chelsea-palmeiras-club-world-cup-learn-lesson
2/11/2022,"India’s largest garment company has paid out an estimated £3m in unpaid wages to tens of thousands of workers, after two years of refusing to pay its workers the legal minimum wage. Last month Shahi Exports, which supplies dozens of international brands, agreed to pay nine months of back pay to about 80,000 workers, with further payments expected in the coming months that will increase the total paid back to workers to £7m.  Shahi and other garment companies across Karnataka, which collectively produce clothing for international brands including Puma, Nike, Zara, Tesco, C&A, Gap, Marks & Spencer and H&M, have been refusing to pay an annual cost-of-living increase to the minimum wage set by the Indian courts in April 2020. More than 400,000 workers were left without their full legal wages for more than 20 months, in what international labour rights groups claimed was the biggest wage theft to hit the fashion industry. In December, garment workers making clothes for the UK high street told the Guardian that they were going hungry and were unable to feed their children as the cost of living increased. The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), which has been working with the Garment and Textile Workers Union and other labour rights groups across Karnataka, said that Shahi’s decision to pay back missing wages to its workers was a significant step forward. WRC said that after international pressure from brands, who have been criticised for not ensuring workers in their supply chains were being paid properly, Shahi and other garment companies across the region had committed to pay around £19m of the £41m owed to workers. “The dam has broken. The big players are paying and others will have no choice but to follow,” said Scott Nova, executive director at WRC. “Yet this went on for two years in broad daylight. The lesson from Karnataka is clear. ” Since April 2020, garment companies across the region had been refusing to pay the annual cost of living increase to the minimum wage, the “variable dearness allowance”, which was increased to 417 Indian rupees (£4.10) a month. Garment suppliers argued that the Ministry of Labour & Employment issued a proclamation suspending the minimum wage increase shortly after it was implemented in April 2020 and that a legal complaint relating to the requirement to pay the increase was still progressing through the courts in Karnataka. However, in September last year, the Karnataka high court ruled that the labour ministry’s proclamation was illegal and that the minimum wage, including all arrears, must be paid to workers regardless of any other court proceedings. In a statement, Shahi said that it was still awaiting the outcome of ongoing legal proceedings relating to the full payment of minimum wage but that it was paying workers due to concerns about how long the court process was taking. The company said it stands by its legal assessment that it had been granted a deferment and disagreed with the claim that it, along with the rest of the garment industry, was noncompliant with minimum wage laws.",News/Global development,Indian supplier to UK fashion brands agrees to pay £3m in unpaid wages,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/11/indian-supplier-to-uk-fashion-brands-agrees-to-pay-3m-in-unpaid-wages
2/11/2022,"The chief financial officer of the oil and gas company BP, Murray Auchincloss, told investors this week: “It’s possible that we’re getting more cash than we know what to do with.” Oil and gas companies have reported bumper profits, as the gas crisis raises the price at which they can sell their fossil fuels, without raising the cost of their extraction.  While they are being showered with cash, households in the UK are suffering the biggest fall in income in three decades, with one in 10 households not having enough money for food and food bank use soaring. This week, BP reported a profit of $12.8bn (£9.4bn) for last year, following Shell’s announcement last week of $19.3bn in profits. Little of the money is going to taxpayers: Channel 4 revealed that BP has paid no tax on its North Sea oil and gas for five years. Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, told analysts he was “not seeing increased pressure” for the company to pay more tax, despite calls in the UK for a windfall tax on fossil fuel profits, to ease the burden of energy bills on the vulnerable. Instead, Looney and other senior managers in the fossil fuel industry have sought to justify their bonanza on the grounds that the billions of extra cash is needed to pour into their transition to low carbon companies. The facts of oil and gas company investment do not bear out the claim that the massive returns are being poured into green projects and the race to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Chris Venables, of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The time for oil and gas companies to have invested in the clean energy transition was two decades ago – when they were peddling climate change denialism. If they were serious about renewable energy, they would be doing it right now, but instead their investments are largely going to new oil and gas. So this is a disingenuous argument.” Investment in clean energy by oil and gas companies was about 1% of their capital expenditure in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), a proportion likely to have reached little more than 4% for the whole of last year. Meanwhile, the companies are continuing to invest vast sums in exploration and new fields, which the IEA said last year could not be brought to fruition if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. BP plans to invest about £2bn-£3bn in renewable energy by 2025, but its overall capital investment will be £60bn, most of which is likely to go into new production that will raise greenhouse gas emissions. The company is estimated to have spent about $3.2bn on clean energy since 2016, and $84bn on oil and as exploration and development over the same period. Looney claimed the “vast majority” of investment in the UK would be in “the energy transition”, but then admitted that this amounted to 40% of its spending budget by 2025, rising to 50% of the budget by the end of the decade. The “green” spending is likely also to include projects such as “blue hydrogen”, derived from fossil fuels, that critics say produces substantially higher carbon emissions than natural gas. Shell’s plans involve an estimated near-term investment of about $2bn-$3bn in low-carbon activities, which is about 10% of its investments, while spending at least $8bn on upstream fossil fuel production. Richard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “The key point about oil and gas majors arguing that higher profits are needed to invest in greening their operations is: prove it. If they argue that is why high profits are justified, they should pledge publicly that a sizable proportion will be invested in proven technologies like wind, solar and storage, rather than blue hydrogen or carbon capture and storage, which are either of unproven potential or several years off.” He was sceptical of whether oil and gas companies would do so. “Past experience suggests that the oil and gas industry is strong on rhetoric when it comes to cleaning up their act, but investment is still inadequate. If they were to make these commitments, with a timeframe for spending, and set up an independent panel of arbiters to verify their commitments, then maybe it would have some credibility.” Labour has called for a windfall tax to ease pressure on energy bills, but oil and gas companies have claimed it would discourage them from investing in low-carbon technologies. Green campaigners doubted these claims. Charlie Kronick, senior climate adviser at Greenpeace, said: “Shell certainly doesn’t need the threat of a windfall tax to discourage them from properly investing in renewables – they’re already failing to do so. ‘Funding the transition’ is a convenient excuse to protect their bloated profits. There’s no guarantee that any oil company will use the extra cash [from this year’s bumper profits] for the green transition unless they’re forced to do so, yet the UK government continues to talk up new production of oil and gas, which will only make the climate emergency worse.” Part of the problem was government failure to shift the balance of economic incentives away from fossil fuels, according to Connor Schwartz, climate lead at Friends of the Earth. “It’s clear that oil and gas companies don’t intend to divert their eye-wateringly excessive profits to fund the green transition we need. They have no profit-based reason to do this, because drilling for oil and gas is more lucrative than investing in cheap, green energy,” he said. “This is partly due to government handouts in the form of subsidies and tax breaks, which reward huge multinationals for exacerbating climate breakdown instead of penalising them.” He added: “It’s wrong that they are making billions while so many are struggling to eat and heat their homes. People know injustice when they see it. Any government that genuinely wants to help people out of a national crisis would introduce a windfall tax on these profiteering, damaging companies.”",News/Business,Facts give lie to claim record oil money is being used to invest in green projects,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/more-cash-than-we-know-what-to-do-with-oil-and-gas-companies-report-bumper-profits
2/11/2022,"Nelson Mandela’s granddaughter has launched an augmented reality project to help people understand more about the stories of black Britons. On the 32nd anniversary of Mandela’s release from prison, Tukwini Mandela said the initiative would “make black history more visible, so it’s never forgotten”. The technology allowed her grandfather’s statue in Trafalgar Square in London to be “brought to life”, she added.  People looking at the statue will be able to listen to a Make Poverty History speech Mandela made in front of a packed crowd in Trafalgar Square in 2005. The aim was to transform Trafalgar Square into a permanent and immersive history lesson, educating people of the true legacies behind black British history, said Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, which has created the project in partnership with Black Cultural Archives. Snap’s research showed that 53% of people say they do not know enough about black history. Twice as many people learned about black history from television and streaming services (43%) as did at school (21%). The AR “Hidden Black Stories” Snapchat experience also shows a boxing ring to represent Bill Richmond and Tom Molineaux, two black boxers who lived in the 1700-1800s. A gym where Richmond trained was situated in Trafalgar Square, and was demolished around the time Nelson’s Column was erected. Molineaux, an American, was his protege. It highlights a black sailor depicted on Nelson’s Column, believed to be George Ryan, in recognition of the role black sailors played in Nelson’s victory at Trafalgar. Its users will also be able to learn more about Mary Seacole, whose statue stands in the grounds of St Thomas’ hospital, opposite the Houses of Parliament. Seacole, who cared for wounded soldiers during the 19th century Crimean war was voted the greatest black Briton in 2004. After a 12-year campaign, her statue was erected in 2016. Lisa Anderson, of Black Cultural Archives, said: “The opportunity to recognise these stories through cutting edge AR technology that reaches younger audiences is exciting and powerful. British history is full of incredible black people and hidden stories that deserve to be told.”",News/UK news,App reveals hidden stories of black Britons in Trafalgar Square,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/app-black-britons-history-trafalgar-square-tukwini-mandela
2/11/2022,"This may be the perfect time to revive a play about the consolations of the imagination, and of theatre, in the aftermath of apocalypse – and one written by the godfather of the absurd. In Eugène Ionesco’s 1952 tragic farce, a pair of ancient performers create entertainment out of the nothingness of their living room to fend off fear of the destroyed world outside. Director Omar Elerian’s translation (with added meta elements) reaches for all its laughs and is woven into sparkling gold by husband-and-wife team Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter. The latter comes fresh from playing the witches in Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth and the pair are as magnetic as each other.  She is a comic grotesque with the disconcerting movements of a ventriloquist’s dummy, while he looks like a Marx brother. Despite their wizened appearance they are childlike, speaking in Edward Lear-esque nonsense verse and clasping hands for comfort in the pauses. Their elliptical story of loneliness and the necessity of fantasy foreshadows Beckett’s Endgame (1957) and Happy Days (1961): this couple could be either Nell and Nagg, or Winnie and Willie, if Beckett had turned them into music-hall double acts. The production builds deftly to the central premise of the play: they are throwing a party for nonexistent guests and seeking comfort in the unseen. Every time the doorbell rings, the couple spring up and shadow-play shows them letting no one in. He flirts with one of the guests; she simulates sex with another. It is a gloriously fizzy cocktail of slapstick, physical theatre and silliness; we are left rapt to drunkenness, caught in their illusion and aware of its madness. It is not arch, head-scratching absurdism but scintillatingly sad comedy. The invisible guests’ arrivals build to ominousness and laughter gives way to confusion, despair and suicide. The play was written in the aftermath of the second world war, and the couple’s trauma and underlying desolation is only caught in snatches at first (“water water everywhere”), but Jackie Shemesh’s warm lighting gradually turns harsh, and they appear whey-faced and ghostly as the script shows glimpses of the obliterated outside world (“London is now dead” and “the sky is red with blood”). They refer to a lost son, clashing in their accounts of his fate, and we see how the “truth” is only what is palatable for each of them in this bombed-out landscape. Just as TS Eliot’s wartime Four Quartets, recently performed by Ralph Fiennes, resonates for now, Ionesco’s drama does the same, while reaching backwards and forwards, too. The play spirals into ever bigger circles of absurdism as the stage is turned into a theatre of empty chairs and then dismantled, the god-like “Speaker” at the end bringing a Godot-like void. The play’s three actors have a shared history in Complicité whose influence is clear here in the meta aspects. We begin with a dressing room conversation “accidentally” broadcasting Magni’s refusal to go out on stage, and there is the presence of an anxious stage manager (Toby Sedgwick) wavering in the wings and furtively creating sound-effects. This brings much delightful humour – there is a “cup of tea” gag and, later, an “invisible table” gag, whose absurdism resembles a Magritte painting. Cécile Trémolières and Naomi Kuyck-Cohen’s set is made up of lush layers of curtains to denote dramas within dramas, and Elena Peña and Pete Malkin’s music is orchestral, spooky and cutely comic. After the couple leave the stage, Sedgwick’s character reflects on what Ionesco intended and how it relates to today. This carries a self-conscious irony – but the couple are an impossible act to follow and the atmosphere sinks, the ending drawn out. It’s still a hugely exciting revival, exciting to watch, with two spine-shiveringly good central performances.

2/11/2022,"SoftBank is facing a battle to float the British chip designer Arm, as it remains mired in a legal fight with the head of its Chinese joint venture, while London Stock Exchange chiefs try to persuade the company to reconsider its snub of the UK for the public listing. The Cambridge-based company has been in dispute with Allen Wu, the head of joint venture Arm China, since 2020 when its board voted to remove him.  Wu, who refused to stand down and retains control of the venture because of legal rights, has escalated the battle by launching a third legal action against Arm China, adding additional red tape that SoftBank will need to overcome before floating Arm. SoftBank, which bought Arm for £24bn in 2016, has been forced to turn to its backup plan of floating the company after its sale to US-based Nvidia collapsed earlier this week on regulatory hurdles. Widespread political and industry opposition in the UK, Europe, US and China scuppered the deal. Last month, Arm, which holds a 47% stake in the joint venture, warned that it had been stopped from auditing the accounts. On Tuesday, Inder Singh, Arm’s chief financial officer, admitted that the company has to resolve the issue in China to progress its plans. “[It’s] important for us to make sure that we have certain rights that will be important for our financials,” he said. “One of those will be the continuing right to audit revenues.” Wu’s latest legal action, first reported by the Financial Times, aims to get him reappointed to the board of Arm China, which contributes about a fifth of the company’s global sales. Meanwhile, the SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son’s decision to snub the UK for the listing of Arm has caused dismay among the financial and business community. “We think that the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US, which is at the centre of global hi-tech, would be most suitable,” Son said. The comments have not helped the view that London is not best suited for tech listings, with it struggling to compete against other financial centres, particularly the US, where valuations are higher. In July, Wise, an international payments transfer service, became the largest ever flotation of a UK tech company but its share price has fallen from 800p to 570p since then. The London Stock Exchange is expected to make a lobbying effort to convince SoftBank of the virtues of a listing in London, or to at least consider a dual listing on both sides of the Atlantic, which Arm had before SoftBank acquired the business. The company had been a member of the FTSE 100 for 18 years before being bought by SoftBank. Last year, new rules were introduced to try to make London more attractive to tech companies, including allowing dual share class structures, which give founders more control after they float a business, and reducing the amount of shares required to be offered to the public to 10%. The London Stock Exchange Group declined to comment on Arm’s flotation plans. Last month, Hermann Hauser, who co-founded Arm in 1990 and was a vocal critic of the deal with Nvidia, said that an independent listing of Arm would probably attract investment from some of its largest customers. Arm has been dubbed the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry because of its neutral status supplying chip designs to almost every industry player. It has more than 500 clients globally, from Apple and Samsung to Qualcomm. “If Arm has an independent future, I think you will find there is a lot of interest from a lot of the companies within the ecosystem to invest in Arm,” said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s chief executive, last June. Other clients that analysts have speculated could show an interest in taking a stake in a publicly listed Arm include Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.",News/Business,SoftBank’s Arm flotation hopes hit by legal fight in China,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/softbank-arm-flotation-legal-fight-china-london-stock-exchange-nasdaq
2/11/2022,"François Ozon started his film-making career in 2000 with an adaptation of an unproduced stage play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Water Drops on Burning Rocks. Now, to open this year’s Berlin film festival, he has returned to the dark master of New German Cinema with a gender-switched version of Fassbinder’s 1972 movie The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, that strange, angular, claustrophobic drama in which only women appear on screen. Fassbinder’s film is set entirely in the apartment of a fashion designer who has an emotionally abusive relationship with her live-in assistant, and then conceives a mad and despairing love for a beautiful young woman who openly cheats on her. Ozon makes some of these characters men, but only some of them. We have to hope he doesn’t get the kind of grief that Paul Feig got for his all-female Ghostbusters, from Fassbinder fans claiming he has trashed their childhoods.  Ozon has removed the bitter tears from the title and also the film itself. For all the histrionics, this is a lot more genial, campy and comic than Fassbinder’s gaunt ordeal. And that is down to it being (mostly) male. The female fashionista is now a male movie director, Peter von Kant, boisterously played by Denis Ménochet – with hints that he’s sort of supposed to be Fassbinder himself, though Fassbinder was a lot tougher and more unsentimental than this guy. Peter has a deadpan houseboy-slash-amanuensis called Karl (Stefan Crepon) who hilariously (as opposed to tragically or erotically) is the intimate witness to all the passionate confrontations between Peter and his lover. Petra’s bitchy female frenemy from the first film is still female: Sidonie, played by Isabelle Adjani. Also still female is Peter’s teen daughter, home from boarding school, played by Aminthe Audiard (grandniece of Jacques). Her pert presence is what makes this (like Water Drops on Burning Rocks) resemble something by Noël Coward. Peter’s beautiful, duplicitous lover Amin is played by Khalil Ben Gharbia and Hanna Schygulla, who played the lover role in 1972, has been brought back to play Peter’s mother. The dynamics are definitely different now that there are both men and women on the screen: it is less airless and crazed, although just as theatrical and artificial. Ozon often gives his characters stagey entrances by framing them self-consciously in a doorway. Ozon’s chief coup in this movie is making Peter a film director, meaning Peter can give Amin a screen test then and there in his apartment, during which he asks Amin about his parents’ tragic death as the camera is rolling and responds with the intensity – part sadistic, part empathetic – of the killer in Peeping Tom. Both Ménochet and Gharbia are very good in this scene. Yet there is something lighter, almost flippant and French-farcical about this new Von Kant: a man brought low by l’amour, inviting from the audience hardly more than a worldly, sympathetic shrug.
