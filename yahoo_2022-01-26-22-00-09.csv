1/26/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia warned Wednesday it would quickly take “retaliatory measures” if the U.S. and its allies reject its security demands and continue their “aggressive” policies, ratcheting up pressure on the West amid concerns that Moscow is planning to invade Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it has any such designs, but the United States and its NATO allies are worried because Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border and launched a series of war games in the region. At the heart of the standoff are questions about Ukraine's future: Russia has demanded guarantees that NATO will never admit the country and other ex-Soviet nations as members and that the alliance will roll back troop deployments in other former Soviet bloc nations. Some of these, like the membership pledge, are nonstarters for NATO, creating a seemingly intractable stalemate that many fear can only end in a war. Speaking to lawmakers Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he and other top officials will advise President Vladimir Putin on the next steps after receiving written replies from the United States to the demands. Those answers are expected this week — even though the U.S. and its allies have already made clear they will reject the top Russian demands. ""If the West continues its aggressive course, Moscow will take the necessary retaliatory measures,” he said. While Russia is currently waiting for the American reply, Lavrov indicated it wouldn't wait forever: “We won’t allow our proposals to be drowned in endless discussions,” he said. Asked by lawmakers if Russia could expand military cooperation with Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua as part of its retaliatory measures, Lavrov responded merely that Moscow has close ties with those countries and is seeking to deepen them. Earlier this month, Lavrov’s deputy pointedly refused to rule out the deployment of Russian military assets to Cuba and Venezuela — far closer to the U.S. than Ukraine — if Moscow’s security demands aren’t met. NATO said this week it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region and the U.S. ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe. Western nations have also sent planeloads of weapons to help Ukraine strengthen its defenses. Amid the escalating tensions, Ukrainian officials have sought to calm nerves. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday that while the concentration of Russian troops near Ukraine poses a threat, “their number is now insufficient for a large-scale offensive.” “They are still missing some key military elements and systems to mount a big, full-scale offensive,” Kuleba told reporters. As others have, he noted that causing alarm could be an end in itself. Russia, he said, hopes to destabilize Ukraine by “spreading panic, raising pressure on Ukraine’s financial system and launching cyberattacks.” “President Putin would be happy to see that plan succeed so that he doesn’t even need to turn to military force to put Ukraine in a vulnerable position,” he said. His comments were latest from Ukrainian officials who have sought to reassure their citizens. Speaking late Tuesday in the second televised speech to the nation in as many days, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ""strong enough to keep everything under control and derail any attempts at destabilization.” Several rounds of high-stakes diplomacy have failed to yield any breakthroughs in the standoff, but another attempt was going forward Wednesday. Presidential advisers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany are set to meet in Paris to discuss ways to revive a stalled peace agreement for eastern Ukraine. In 2014, following the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow expects a “good frank” talk at the Paris meeting. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of planning to retake the areas controlled by the rebels — something Kyiv denies. On Wednesday, Lavrov again alleged that the West is encouraging Ukraine to launch an offensive and rejected the Western talk about an imminent Russian invasion as “hysterics.” In addition to the military moves, the U.S. and its allies have threatened sanctions like never before if Moscow sends its troops into Ukraine, but they have given few details, saying it’s best to keep Putin guessing. On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters that Putin “continues to build forces along Ukraine’s border,” and an attack “would be the largest invasion since World War II. It would change the world.” He warned that there would be serious economic consequences for Putin, including personal sanctions, in the event of an invasion. Asked to comment on Biden's statement, Peskov pointed out that the Russian president and other top officials don't have assets in the West but reaffirmed that such U.S. sanctions would be “politically destructive” for bilateral ties. Britain is also promising sanctions, and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has urged European nations to do more to support Ukraine. The U.K. has sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, though it has ruled out sending combat troops. “We’ll be legislating to toughen up our sanctions regime and make sure we are fully able to hit both individuals and companies and banks in Russia in the event of an incursion,” she told the BBC. “What’s important is that all of our allies do the same.” Amid the soaring tensions, the U.S., Britain, Australia, Germany and Canada have also moved to withdraw some of their diplomats and dependents from Kyiv. ___ Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,Russia threatens retaliation if Ukraine demands not met,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-threatens-retaliation-ukraine-demands-113805512.html
1/26/2022,"Fox News’ Sean Hannity was taken to task on his own show by Geraldo Rivera for airing an attack ad accusing President Joe Biden of cognitive decline. Hannity parroted the right-wing talking point that Biden is mentally unfit for office by comparing footage of the president’s speeches over the years with a new spot released by the Republican National Committee that highlighted his pauses during a last week’s marathon news conference. “I think the montage you put together of the 46th president was deeply insulting and highly political,” Rivera, a veteran pundit on the conservative network, told Hannity on Tuesday. Conservative commentator Dan Bongino sided with fellow Donald Trump acolyte Hannity. “I cannot believe you’re going to die on this hill,” he told Rivera, later adding: “Admit the guy is cognitively compromised, drop the loss, and let’s move on. It is a dying argument.” Rivera accused Bongino of being “shocking and outrageous,” calling the smear a “political diagnosis.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

1/26/2022,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — A Delaware lawmaker who came under fire last year for using a racist and sexist slur to refer to sex workers was arrested on shoplifting charges Tuesday, just days after announcing that he was resigning for health reasons. Newark police said a warrant was issued Tuesday for Rep. Gerald Brady’s arrest on two counts of shoplifting, and that Brady, 65, turned himself in a few hours later. He was released on his own recognizance. House Democrats announced last Friday that Brady was resigning effective Feb. 4, but they did not disclose that he was under criminal investigation. Newark police said in a press release Tuesday that they received a report shortly after 5 p.m. on Jan. 12 of a shoplifting incident at an Acme grocery store. An employee told officers that he saw a man enter the store and recognized him from a Dec. 29 shoplifting incident that had not been reported to police. In the second incident, the employee was able to identify the suspect’s car and get the license plate number, then watched him push a shopping cart full of merchandise past the registers and toward the exit, according to police. After being confronted by the employee, the man declined to pay for the merchandise, left the store and entered his car. Police were told that the suspect’s vehicle had a General Assembly license plate bearing Brady’s initials. After viewing a photo of Brady, the store employee confirmed that the vehicle owner and the suspect in the two incidents was the same person. Victor Battaglia Jr., an attorney representing Brady, said it would be “premature” to comment on his arrest. “We would just ask that people and the media not jump to any conclusions,” Battaglia said, adding that Brady is scheduled for arraignment some time in March. Andrew Volturo, a spokesperson for the House Democrats, declined to comment on Brady’s arrest. He instead pointed to a statement last Friday in which House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf described Brady as “a kind and empathetic representative” and noted that Brady had said he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Brady indicated in a prepared statement earlier Friday that the diagnosis was the result of his deployments to the Middle East with the Delaware National Guard. “Our first and foremost thoughts are that Gerald gets the help he needs,” Schwartzkopf said at the time. Brady, who is executive director of the Delaware AFL-CIO, faced calls for his resignation last summer after he inadvertently sent an email to an advocate for decriminalizing prostitution in which Brady used a slur. Thinking he was forwarding an email from the advocate to another person from whom he was seeking input, Brady instead mistakenly hit “reply” and sent his comments to the advocate. The advocate had referred to a study indicating that the presence of strip clubs and other adult entertainment establishments in New York City led to a decrease in sex crimes. Researchers suggested that the reduction was mostly driven by potential sex offenders frequenting those establishments rather than committing crimes. “Is the dude basically saying, if we provide free (oral sex) for Uncle Pervie there will be few rapes and few (a slur for Chinese women) will be shipped in CONEX containers to the Port of Wilmington??” Brady wrote from his official government email address. Amid calls for Brady’s resignation, Democratic House leaders had ordered him to complete sensitivity training and to reach out to members of the Asian American community in an effort to regain their trust. A week later, Brady announced that he would not seek reelection after his current term expires. That was not sufficient for some critics, including fellow lawmakers. Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton, a Newark Democrat, filed a complaint against Brady with the House Ethics Committee, alleging that he had engaged in conduct that either brings the House into disrepute or reflects adversely on a member’s fitness to hold office. Following a closed-door meeting of the Democrat-led committee, Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst announced in September that committee members had unanimously agreed that Brady did not violate legislative rules of conduct and that no further action would be taken. The statement was accompanied by a memorandum in which attorneys for the Democratic and Republican caucuses noted that there was no precedent for disciplining a lawmaker for speech outside of legislative proceedings, and that the prospect of such disciplinary action raised First Amendment concerns.",U.S./Associated Press,Lawmaker criticized for slurs arrested on shoplifting counts,https://news.yahoo.com/lawmaker-criticized-slurs-arrested-shoplifting-222755848.html
