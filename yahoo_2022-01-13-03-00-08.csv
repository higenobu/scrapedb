1/13/2022,"A Georgia sheriff’s deputy in middle Georgia has been “suspended without pay pending termination” after allegedly calling murder victim Ahmaud Arbery a “criminal” on social media. In addition to labeling the slain jogger as a criminal, he is accused of smugly writing, “he still got the death penalty.” Houston County Deputy Paul Urhahn commented on the Macon outlet’s Facebook post about the recent sentencing of Arbery’s killers, Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael, and William Bryan. The deputy replied, “That criminal arbery still got the death penalty though.” On Friday, Jan. 7, the three men were handed down life sentences for their roles in the 25-year-old’s death. The McMichaels both received life sentences with no possibility of parole, plus an additional 20 years. Bryan, a McMichaels neighbor, was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 30 years. Judge Timothy Walmsley stated at sentencing, “Ahmaud Arbery was then hunted down and shot, and he was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands.” Despite deleting the comment, screenshots have been shared across social media, landing in the Houston County Sheriff’s Office. Over the weekend, the sheriff’s office launched an investigation, and on the morning of Monday, Jan. 10, decided to suspend Urhahn without pay and pending termination. Sheriff Cullen Talton wrote a letter detailing how the deputy violated several of the department’s policies, all relating to code of conduct: Page 5 (4A) – An officer must at all times, on and off duty, conduct him/herself in a manner which does not bring discredit to the department or county. Page 5 (4B) – Conduct unbecoming of an officer shall include that conduct (2) – Which has a tendency to destroy public respect for employees and confidence in the department. The blowback from the comment did not stop with the department. Activist Eli Porter, a member of the Poor And Minority Justice Association told WGXA, “That deputy represents that entire department, and for him to say something like that — I’m just … it got under my skin.” Porter believed that the sheriff’s immediate response communicated a powerful message to the community, showing everyone that “the sheriff’s office does not stand with what Paul said.” Few people have expressed solidarity with the disgraced officer. Kimberly Ochelli wrote, “Exactly the type of person we do not need to be a Peace Officer not only in our beautiful city, but anywhere. He deserved exactly what he earned.” “He deserves to lose his job,” Laurie Hardeman posted in the comment section. “When a racist shows his true colors they need to learn just how ignorant they act. And it reflects on how he or she was brought up and how ignorant their family is also.” But some believed that his freedom of speech had been violated. “The man has a right to his opinion, why should some people be denied their right to express themselves because they work in certain areas,” wrote Will Maddox. Lawana Henrich asked, “I do not know what he said but what happened to freedom of speech?” Urhahn has an opportunity to appeal this decision over the next 10 days. If he does not, his termination will be effective on Jan. 20.

1/13/2022,"Health insurance companies will be required to cover eight at-home COVID-19 tests a month per customer. Consumers can apply for reimbursement starting Saturday or visit in-network retailers for a free test. The Biden administration also plans to distribute 500 million free coronavirus tests in January. People with private health insurance will be able to get at-home COVID-19 tests free of charge starting Saturday, the Biden administration announced Monday. The new coverage requirement means that insurance companies must cover eight over-the-counter, at-home COVID-19 tests per individual per month. Any of the home test kits authorized or approved by the Food and Drug Administration are eligible for reimbursement. It's unclear whether the policy only covers rapid antigen tests (like Abbott's BinaxNOW) or if pricier, mail-in PCR tests will be free of charge as well. Most insurance companies already cover the cost of a PCR test in a healthcare setting if an individual has symptoms or has been exposed to COVID-19. The Biden administration also promised 500 million free rapid coronavirus tests in January, which press secretary Jen Psaki said will be ""out the door in the coming weeks,"" speaking to reporters at Monday's White House news briefing. Most consumers will be able to get the tests, which cost between $15 and $35 for a two-pack, covered up front at their insurer's ""preferred"" pharmacies. Insurers are required to pay for $12 per individual test (or $24 per two-pack) at out-of-network locations, leaving the rest of the cost to the consumer. You can check your insurer's website to see if it has a network of specific retailers set up; otherwise, the company is responsible for the cost of all eight tests with no limit on price. The cost of test kits is enough to keep many people from getting tested at home, and long lines and faraway locations may make in-person testing inaccessible as well. For the roughly 150 million Americans with private health insurance, at least one barrier to testing will soon be broken down — although many of the tests that are covered under the new policy are currently sold out. As of now, people on Medicare will not be able to get their at-home COVID-19 tests reimbursed through the program, according to the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services. Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program plans are already required to fully cover the cost of at-home tests. The Department of Defense has finalized at least two contracts related to the tests: one with a distribution company based in Virginia, and recently another with Revival Health, a California company tasked with ""procuring 13.3 million over-the-counter COVID-19 test kits."" It's not yet clear which tests will make up the rest of the order. Americans will need to order a free test online in order to get one from the incoming batch. The administration is still working on a plan to deliver millions of tests across the country, as well as extra efforts in underserved communities. Here are the 11 tests that may be covered, for home delivery or pharmacy reimbursement, based on what's already authorized by the FDA: CareStart COVID-19 Antigen Home Test iHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test BD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 Test SCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-Test BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self Test InteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid Test Celltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home Test QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test Flowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home Test BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card 2 Home Test Ellume COVID-19 Home Test Read the original article on Business Insider",Business/Business Insider,All Americans will soon get 8 free COVID-19 tests a month covered by insurance — here's how to get them,https://news.yahoo.com/americans-soon-8-free-covid-153215313.html
1/13/2022,"ORLANDO, Fla. — Rep. Matt Gaetz’s ex-girlfriend gave testimony Wednesday to a federal grand jury investigating him for sex crimes, a major development that suggests the Department of Justice may be moving closer to indicting him. The ex-girlfriend, whose name is being withheld by NBC News to respect her privacy, has been in talks for months with prosecutors to receive an immunity deal. Under a possible deal, she would avoid prosecution for obstruction of justice in return for testifying in an investigation into whether Gaetz in 2017 had sex with a 17-year-old female for money and whether months later he and others violated a federal law prohibiting people for paying for prostitutes overseas. Legal sources familiar with the case say Gaetz is being investigated for three distinct crimes: Sex trafficking the 17-year-old; violating the Mann Act, which prohibits taking prostitutes across state lines; and obstructing justice. Gaetz, R-Fla., has never been charged with any crime and has denied all accusations, saying he never paid for sex and never had sex with a minor when he was an adult. The firebrand conservative has called the federal investigation into him a DOJ “witch hunt.” The attorney for Gaetz’s ex-girlfriend, Tim Jansen, declined comment about the case Wednesday, when he was spotted by an NBC News reporter entering the federal courthouse in Orlando with his client. A Department of Justice spokesman declined comment. Gaetz did not respond to a request for comment. The investigation into Gaetz has lasted for more than a year and began when a former friend and ally of his, former Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, was charged with a host of crimes — from falsely smearing a political rival as a pedophile to cheating taxpayers in a cryptocurrency scheme to sex-trafficking the same 17-year-old that Gaetz is now under investigation for having had sex with for money. Greenberg has agreed to plead guilty to six of the charges against him and is cooperating with federal investigators, NBC News has previously reported. He has pleaded guilty to charges of identity theft, stalking, wire fraud, conspiracy to bribe a public official and sex trafficking of a minor. According to one source familiar with the case, the alleged sex-trafficking victim had told investigators at one point that Gaetz had had sex with her. But the investigation into Gaetz was stalled as prosecutors sought the cooperation of Gaetz’s ex-girlfriend, according to those familiar with the case, because her testimony could help fill in crucial aspects of the case. The ex-girlfriend was in an open relationship with Gaetz in 2017 and 2018 and allegedly discussed other women he was involved with, according to three friends of the former couple. She allegedly went with Gaetz and a number of other young women and friends of the congressman in 2018 on a trip to the Bahamas, a trip that is also under scrutiny, CBS News and Politico previously reported. After the investigation began, Gaetz spoke with his ex-girlfriend in a three-way call with yet another woman who was cooperating with federal investigators at that point and was secretly recording the call, according to two sources familiar with the case. It’s on that call that Gaetz is suspected of obstructing justice, which federal prosecutors are investigating, according to law enforcement sources. After that phone call was first reported in April, Gaetz denied the allegations through a spokesperson. “Congressman Gaetz pursues justice, he doesn’t obstruct it,"" the spokesperson said in a written statement. Jansen, the ex-girlfriend’s attorney, has a reputation in Florida legal circles for his mastery of immunity deals after he secured one for an admitted murderer who ultimately was not charged for the crime in return for helping authorities solve the case.",U.S./NBC News,Matt Gaetz's ex-girlfriend testifies to grand jury in sex trafficking probe,https://news.yahoo.com/matt-gaetzs-ex-girlfriend-testifies-171732720.html
1/13/2022,"Forecasters are watching a storm that could bring heavy snow to Southern New England starting Sunday into Monday. They're actually eyeing two storms, but the first, on Friday, looks like it will mostly miss the region. The second storm, still four days away, is more likely to hit Southern New England and bring a ""significant amount"" of precipitation, but the question is how much of it would fall as snow and where, according to the National Weather Service. ""There is the potential for a strong storm late Sunday into Monday, but specific impacts and precipitation types remain uncertain,"" the weather service said in its forecast discussion Wednesday morning. The ""current forecast will be snow changing to rain along the south coast and all snow farther north,"" the weather service said. According to AccuWeather, the storm, known as a ""Saskatchewan Screamer,"" will drop into the United States from Western Canada and follow the Jet Stream south before heading either east out to sea or north up the coast. [Upcoming Weather Concerns] Dry weather with significantly milder temps Wed & Thu. A bit of rain/snow may graze parts of eastern MA/RI on Fri with another shot of arctic air Fri night & Sat. A potentially strong storm is possible late Sun into Mon, but that is not set in stone. pic.twitter.com/9uBAfGmGFi — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) January 11, 2022 ""The jury is still out as to whether the storm will keep moving along at a steady eastward clip and out to sea or instead make another turn, this time to the north and along the mid-Atlantic and New England coasts early next week,"" AccuWeather says. Calm before the storm: National Weather Service: Warmer air returns after arctic blast ""The eastward and out-to-sea track would limit the amount of snow and ice in the Southeast and prevent snow from spreading up the Interstate 95 corridor,"" AccuWeather says. ""On the other hand, a northward turn would open up the door for a major storm with a heavy swath of snow and mixed precipitation in the mid-Atlantic and New England from Sunday night to Monday."" Computer model consensus ""now favors"" the storm moving up the coast, spreading precipitation into Southern New England Sunday night and leaving the region late Monday, the Weather Service said Wednesday morning. jperry@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7614 On Twitter: @jgregoryperry Be the first to know.
