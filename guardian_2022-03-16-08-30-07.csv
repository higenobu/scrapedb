3/16/2022,"New Zealand is re-opening its borders to the world, after two years spent closed off by the pandemic. From 13 April, vaccinated tourists from Australia will be able to enter the country without isolating. From 2 May vaccinated tourists from other visa-waiver countries, including the US, UK, Germany, Canada, Japan, Singapore and others, will be allowed entry. “We’re ready to welcome the world back,” prime minister Jacinda Ardern said. “New Zealand will be ready with open arms.” “We are ready to roll out the green and gold carpet to our Australian neighbours, and in time for the school holidays,” tourism minister Stuart Nash said. “We have missed you.” It is now two years from Ardern’s 2020 decision to snap close New Zealand’s borders, as the country’s first outbreak of Covid cases sprang up. The country successfully eliminated the virus in-country, and spent a large chunk of the two years that followed Covid-free, as coronavirus swept around the world. Even as the Omicron outbreak grows, with 15-20,000 cases a day, the country has maintained the lowest death rate in the OECD, with 115 deaths in total since the pandemic began. It is reopening now after vaccinating the vast majority of adults – 95% of those aged 12 and over are now double-vaccinated, and 72% have had a booster shot. The announcement will come as a relief for the country’s tourism and hospitality businesses, many of which have struggled to survive the border closures. According to Tourism Industry Aotearoa, total tourism expenditure in 2021 fell by 37% – a loss of $15.6bn – from the previous year. Pre-Covid figures show tourism was New Zealand’s biggest export industry, contributing 20% of total exports and directly accounting for 5.5% of GDP. “This brings with it huge economic opportunities for us – we will be a sought-after market. We’re now known globally as not just being clean and green, but also being safe, so we know that we’ll be in high demand,” Ardern said. Nash said it would take time to rebuild the sector. While those with approved visitor visas from anywhere in the world can enter from May, tourists from countries without visa waivers – including China and India – at this stage are will not be able to enter until October. Ardern said those dates would also be reviewed. “We are considering how we might be able to bring forward other visa categories as well,” she said. Those who enter will have to have a negative pre-departure test. “While we have removed all travel isolation so that tourists will be able to experience the sights and sounds [of Aotearoa] immediately, they will be required to have a pre-departure test,” Ardern said. Earlier this year, the government opened the borders to New Zealanders trapped overseas – many of whom had spent months or years locked out of the country by strict border rules and limited quarantine space. The country also opened its border to skilled and essential workers on Monday. The country has delayed its reopening strategy as new variants emerged – first for Delta and then Omicron.",News/World news,New Zealand to open borders to vaccinated travellers from next month,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/new-zealand-to-open-borders-to-vaccinated-travellers-from-next-month
3/16/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has called for Mohamed Salah to receive more protection from referees after saying it is “crazy” how few free-kicks the forward is awarded when fouled. The Liverpool manager believes it is inexplicable Salah does not get given more decisions and wrong when he is branded a diver. Although only Alexandre Lacazette and Ivan Toney have won more penalties in the Premier League than Salah this season, some 114 players have drawn more fouls than the Egyptian, with officials penalising opponents for only 20 challenges on Salah in 26 matches. On average he is awarded a free-kick only every 110 minutes this season, even though he has the fourth-most touches in the final third and the highest number in the 18-yard box. “It is absolutely crazy how low the number of fouls is against him,” Klopp said. “So he has constant contact [from defenders] and is going down all the time, having to get up again. The statistic is that Mo is the one player who is fouled the least compared to other [top] strikers. Honestly, you have to ask the refs; I don’t know because we constantly think he gets fouled. He gets confronted with the [claim] that someone calls him a diver. That is an absolute shame. “We don’t get even close to the number of free-kicks that we should have. You must ask other people how that is possible because he is the guy who is constantly with the ball around the box and there is no foul: interesting. How is that? It is just not possible.” Salah came off in Saturday’s win at Brighton with a minor foot problem but is fit to face Arsenal on Wednesday and keep up his record of not missing a game through injury since 2019. Klopp praised him for his determination and durability. “Mo is a tough cookie,” he said. “He is very professional and desperate to play every game. He has worked on his body as well. There are players who are more vulnerable than others but Mo obviously has the right attitude, the right mindset and the right body for it as well.” Victory would put Liverpool one point behind Manchester City, after the leaders were held at Crystal Palace on Monday, with a meeting against Pep Guardiola’s team to come in April. “Win every game, we win the league?” Klopp said. “That’s actually the best news; the only problem is the word ‘if’ is wonderful information. It’s in our hands but it’s still pretty slippery.” Klopp feels City remain favourites but has vowed to irritate them in their pursuit. “That is the plan, that we keep being as annoying as possible,” he said. “We try to win all of our games. It is really difficult, but we try. It is final after final after final after final after final after final that we play. Now everything is in front of us: attack it, chase it, go for it.”",Sport/Football,"Mo Salah needs more protection from referees, claims Jürgen Klopp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/liverpool-mo-salah-needs-more-protection-from-referees-claims-jurgen-klopp
3/16/2022,"Mikel Arteta believes there is still a significant gap between Arsenal and the Premier League’s title contenders but says the club are finally shaking off years of “feeling sorry for ourselves”. Arsenal host Liverpool on Wednesday night in a match of critical importance to the battles for first and fourth. Should Arteta’s side earn a sixth straight win it would put them four points clear of Manchester United, who are fifth, with two games in hand; they would also move to within five points of Chelsea having played a game fewer, but Arteta cautioned that they remain well short of the standards he wants to set. “Still far,” he said. “We have to make things quicker, sharper. We can be more adaptable, we can be much more unpredictable, we can have much more flexibility and we can be much more consistent throughout games to maintain that level. “I think we are much closer than we were, and probably the closest we have been in terms of what we are looking for. But I focus on that gap, and that gap is still big.” It is a mark of Arsenal’s rapid strides, though, that there would not be too many eyebrows raised if they overcame Liverpool. They outplayed Manchester City for long periods on New Year’s Day and the buzz around the Emirates, an intimidating venue for visiting sides this season and one where Arsenal have dropped only 10 points, is palpable. Arteta explained that they have had to change the downtrodden demeanour that had dogged the club in recent years, and stop repeating old mistakes. “I hate that feeling, of feeling sorry for ourselves,” he said. “Of saying: ‘Oh, this is happening to us again.’ A lot of things happen, and when they happen we have to find the reason why it happens. “If we don’t want it happening again, we have to do something about it because if we keep doing the same thing then I expect the same – or worse – to happen, because we already have a history. We have less margin to suffer, because we have already been there. “We have to change that dynamic completely, look at what we can become and how we are going to do it. If we put all the effort and energy there, the rest will take care of itself.” Arteta said a win over Liverpool would provide “another click and another boost in confidence” for his team. “Beating Liverpool with the way they are playing today is extremely difficult and we are aware of that,” he continued. “But if we get to the game with the belief and understanding of doing what we can do, the game is there for the taking.” Takehiro Tomiyasu has an outside chance of returning from his recurring calf injury, but Arteta struck a cautious note on the right-back’s involvement. “We have been trying to push him, but with the handbrake a little bit because we need to be careful as we don’t want to get another injury with him,” he said. “We don’t know [if Wednesday is too soon]. Let’s see how he trains.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta insists ‘gap is still big’ between Arsenal and title contenders,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/mikel-arteta-says-gap-is-still-big-between-arsenal-and-title-contenders
3/16/2022,"The world has at last caught up with what Cock’s central character calls the “stew” of sexual identity. First performed in 2009, Mike Bartlett’s comedy might have seemed edgy then but today it echoes and affirms notions around the slipperiness of sexual labelling. Its hitherto gay protagonist, John (Jonathan Bailey), who lives with his long-term partner, M (Taron Egerton), triggers a three-way existential earthquake when he falls for a woman, W (Jade Anouka), and butts up against social expectations to define – or redefine – himself. “Gay”, “bi” and “straight” are bygone terms from the 1960s, John insists, but he nonetheless feels the pressure to place himself in one camp. Bartlett’s dialogue still zings in its best moments and richly explores passion, relationship choices, cowardice and commitment. But the central angst-ridden axis of the play – the question of whether sexual identity is fixed and genetic or on a sliding scale in which choice comes into play – seems less of a conundrum these days. Its edge now lies in its theatrical repackaging by Marianne Elliott in this boldly stylised revival – with mixed results. The play begins in hyperactive, puppyish mode; Bailey and Egerton are a double-act with their theatrical bickering and physical comedy. Their performances are amusingly arch but iron away finer switches in mood and feeling. When they settle, they conjure powerful moments. Egerton is especially affecting in his romantic desperation as he loses power in the relationship. Anouka brings fun and frothy comedy over anything more penetrating, although the chemistry on stage succeeds in seeming real. Bailey gives a strong performance, growing ever more unlikable until he is the spoilt, sullen child of the ending, but we never quite see what M or W find so lovable in this dithering, disrespectful player of a partner. Merle Hensel’s set is both empty and claustrophobic in its bareness, with only a revolving door and a bench, along with school-hall strip lighting overhead (designed by Paule Constable). Our eye is led to every twitch and turn these characters make in this emptiness. Rather like the recent revivals of Lungs and Constellations, which have given a similarly forensic focus to a single relationship, it strips them down to the bone and accentuates their emotional nakedness. This minimalism is accompanied by an overt, rather too cute theatricality – actors gesture at taking off their clothes, John swivels a shoulder in circles to represent the act of sex, M mimes in lieu of serving food when his father (Phil Daniels) arrives for the dinner-party showdown. It is a demand, however playful, for the audience to imaginatively engage, but it also seems as if Elliott has conceptualised a deeper meaning beyond our grasp. Is the play simply celebrating its own theatricality or is there more to it? The set’s mirrored walls bring a sense of interiority and the actors perform Matrix-like slow-motion choreography in between scenes that might reflect the emotional shifts in the relationships, but sometimes comes off as corny. It all combines into a slightly mystifying non-naturalism that is at once flamboyant and no-frills. And where the theatrical tics in Elliott and Miranda Cromwell’s staging of Death of a Salesman gave the play an astonishing invention and power, the stylised elements here do not service this play’s meanings but seem like playful add-ons. One of the most powerful scenes comes at the end, in John’s childishly sulky intransigence, and here Cock’s drama ultimately reveals itself not as a contest between heteronormativity and gay partnerships, or a play about the right to resist one fixed identity, but a far more old-fashioned love triangle with a selfish, destructive and cruel figure at its centre. Cock is at the Ambassadors theatre, London, until 4 June",Arts/Stage,Cock review – Jonathan Bailey and Taron Egerton locked in a love triangle,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/15/cock-review-jonathan-bailey-taron-egerton-marianne-elliott
