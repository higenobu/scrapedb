4/25/2022,"My friend Amal Treacher Kabesh, who has died aged 67 of multiple causes including diabetes, was a scholar and lecturer whose roots in Egypt informed much of the psychosocial studies research – including two books, Postcolonial Masculinities (2013) and Egyptian Revolutions (2017), which brought together postcolonial, psychoanalytic and feminist theories to insightful effect. Amal was born in London, where her father, Ahmed Kabesh, an Egyptian national, was studying for a PhD and her mother, Anne (nee Chippington), was a daughter of the caretaker at the Egyptian embassy. Her early years were lived in comfortable surroundings in Cairo, where her father became a minister in Nasser’s government; there were ballet classes, an excellent school and visits to Groppi’s cafe. But in 1964, after her parents divorced, she moved back to London with her mother and sister, Amany. Settling in Thornton Heath, where her mother worked for the gas board, life was soon different. After leaving Davidson Road secondary modern school in 1970, Amal studied secretarial skills at Pitman’s, then qualified as a psychiatric nurse, working at the radical psychotherapy residential clinic at Peper Harow in Surrey. She was accepted in 1981 – without any O- or A-levels – on to a cultural studies degree course at North East London Polytechnic (now University of East London), where she and I met and became friends. In the summer of 1983 I went with Amal to Cairo to help her look for her father, with whom she had had no contact for 20 years. Armed only with an old address for a friend of Amal’s mother, we hailed a taxi but discovered that in Egypt, new governments change the street names. Despite this, we tracked Ahmed down, and so began Amal’s reconnection with her Egyptian family and with Egypt. Father and daughter were able to re-establish their relationship before Amal returned to Britain to complete her degree and then gain a PhD in psychosocial studies in 1990. Thereafter Amal had an academic career that included lectureships in sociology at North East London Polytechnic and psychosocial studies at Birkbeck, University of London. In 2005 she was appointed as a lecturer in Nottingham University’s sociology department, where she stayed for 17 years. The arc of Amal’s life began and ended in Cairo, where she died only four months after retiring from Nottingham as associate professor. Amal touched countless lives, of students, colleagues and friends. She wove the threads of her own life into her writing, but more than anything, her experience shaped her boundlessly generous, humane and non-judgmental spirit and commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion that was recognised, in 2022, by the award of Nottingham University’s vice-chancellor’s medal. In 2005 she married Amir Hawash, who was in the Egyptian military before becoming a tour guide. He survives her, as do Amir’s children from a previous relationship, Fatma, Mohammed, Moustapha and Noha, and her sister Amany.",News/Education,Amal Treacher Kabesh obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/24/amal-treacher-kabesh-obituary
4/25/2022,"It was an audacious and highly professional heist. At 2am on a June night in 2003, five men wearing balaclavas and blue boilersuits smashed their way through a window at Waddesdon Manor, the extravagant French-style chateau built in Buckinghamshire by the Rothschild banking dynasty. Despite high security, they grabbed more than 100 gold boxes and other precious objects worth several million pounds – and four minutes later they were gone. Almost all disappeared without trace. But 19 years after the robbery, one of the tiny gold boxes has been recovered and returned to Waddesdon. On Wednesday, it will go on display in the Rothschild Treasury, a gallery that houses more than 300 objects made from rare and precious materials The French bonbonnière – a small ornamental box often kept in a pocket or boudoir and used for sweets – dates from 1775-81 and was made in Paris. It is circular, with gold piqué stars on a dark blue ground and a tortoiseshell interior. On its lid is a miniature of a woman holding a basket of roses. It came up for sale at a UK regional auction house last August. The auctioneers ran it through the Art Loss Register (ALR), a private database of stolen, looted and disputed art and artefacts. Staff at the ALR identified it as one of the items stolen in the Waddesdon raid. Lucy O’Meara, an expert on country house thefts and a recovery specialist at the ALR, said it was “an honour to assist in returning a small part of the house’s cultural history to its rightful place”. She hoped the remaining boxes “will be reunited with the collection very soon”. The ALR contacted Thames Valley police, which investigated the Waddesdon heist. At the time, police believed the items were stolen to order, describing the robbery as a “professional raid by people who knew what they wanted”. The Waddesdon collection of 18th-century miniature gold boxes was considered one of the world’s rarest, and Lord Rothschild offered a reward of £50,000 for its return. Pippa Shirley, the director of collections, historic properties and landscapes at Waddesdon, said: “The 2003 theft was deeply traumatic for everyone at Waddesdon – I remember it vividly – and this feels such a positive outcome and gives us hope that the other boxes may yet come back to us.” Waddesdon, near Aylesbury, was built in the late 19th century by Ferdinand de Rothschild as a place to host weekend house parties. The house was designed to showcase his exceptional collection of English portraits, French 18th-century furniture, Sèvres porcelain, and other decorative arts. Owned by the National Trust since 1957, Waddesdon has been used as a venue for visiting heads of state including Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and France’s François Mitterrand.",Arts/Culture,Gold box stolen in 2003 Waddesdon Manor heist is returned home ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/24/gold-box-stolen-in-2003-waddesdon-manor-heist-is-returned-home
4/25/2022,"Dozens of civilians who died during the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian city of Bucha were killed by tiny metal arrows from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery, forensic doctors have said. Pathologists and coroners who are carrying out postmortems on bodies found in mass graves in the region north of Kyiv, where occupying Russian forces have been accused of atrocities, said they had found small metal darts, called fléchettes, embedded in people’s heads and chests. “We found several really thin, nail-like objects in the bodies of men and women and so did others of my colleagues in the region,” Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor, told the Guardian. “It is very hard to find those in the body, they are too thin. The majority of these bodies come from the Bucha-Irpin region.” Independent weapons experts who reviewed pictures of the metal arrows found in the bodies, seen by the Guardian, confirmed that they were fléchettes, an anti-personnel weapon widely used during the first world war. These small metal darts are contained in tank or field gun shells. Each shell can contain up to 8,000 fléchettes. Once fired, shells burst when a timed fuse detonates and explodes above the ground. Fléchettes, typically between 3cm and 4cm in length, release from the shell and disperse in a conical arch about 300m wide and 100m long. On impact with a victim’s body, the dart can lose rigidity, bending into a hook, while the arrow’s rear, made of four fins, often breaks away causing a second wound. According to a number of witnesses in Bucha, fléchette rounds were fired by Russian artillery a few days before forces withdrew from the area at the end of March. Svitlana Chmut, a resident of Bucha, told the Washington Post she had found several nailed on her car. Although human rights groups have long sought a ban on fléchette shells, the munitions are not prohibited under international law. However, the use of imprecise lethal weapons in densely populated civilian areas is a violation of humanitarian law. According to Neil Gibson, a weapons expert at the UK-based Fenix Insight group, who has reviewed the photos of the fléchettes found in Bucha, the metal darts came from a 122mm 3Sh1 artillery round, in use by Russian artillery. “Another uncommon and rarely seen projectile,” said Gibson on Twitter. “This time it’s the Russian equivalent of the US ‘Beehive’ series of Anti-personnel (APERS) projectiles … It operates like a true shrapnel projectile, but is filled with fléchettes and a wax binder.” Fléchettes have been used as ballistic weapons since the first world war. Dropped by the then-novel airplanes to attack infantry, the lethal metal darts were able to pierce helmets. They were not widely used during the second world war, but re-emerged in the Vietnam war, when the US employed a version of fléchette loads, packed into plastic cups. “Fléchettes are an anti-personnel weapon designed to penetrate dense vegetation and to strike a large number of enemy soldiers,” according to Amnesty International. “They should never be used in built-up civilian areas.” “You don’t have to be an arms expert to understand that Russia ignored the rules of war in Bucha,” Bucha’s mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said. “Bucha was turned into a Chechen safari, where they used landmines against civilians.” Russian forces captured Bucha, 18.5 miles (30km) north-west of Kyiv, after ferocious fighting a few days after the invasion began in February. They were given an order to retreat at the end of March and in the subsequent days, mass gravescontaining the bodies of hundreds of people who had apparently been massacred came to light. A team of 18 experts from the forensic department of France’s national gendarmerie, alongside a team of forensic investigators from Kyiv, have started documenting the terror inflicted on civilians during the month-long occupation. “We are seeing a lot mutilated (disfigured) bodies,” said Pirovsky. “A lot of them had their hands tied behind their backs and shots in the back of their heads. There were also cases with automatic gunfire, like six to eight holes on the back of victims. And we have several cases of cluster bombs’ elements embedded in the bodies of the victims.” Evidence collected by the Guardian during a visit to Bucha, Hostomel and Borodianka, and reviewed by independent weapons experts, showed that Russian troops used cluster munitions – which are banned in much of the world – and powerful unguided bombs in populated areas, which have destroyed at least eight civilian buildings. Fléchettes are rarely used in modern warfare, other than periodically by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), which deployed them in military operations in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, killing and wounding civilians. In March 2008, a Palestinian journalist and videographer with Reuters, Fadel Shana, was killed by fléchettes from a shell fired by an Israeli tank. X-rays later showed metal darts embedded in Shana’s chest, legs and flak jacket, which was not armoured.",News/World news,Dozens of Bucha civilians were killed by metal darts from Russian artillery,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/dozens-bucha-civilians-killed-flechettes-metal-darts-russian-artillery
4/25/2022,"Chelsea came from behind and battled back following the sending-off of their goalkeeper, Ann-Katrin Berger, to earn a 3-1 win from a feisty match with Tottenham and maintain their title charge. Sam Kerr was once again the hero, heading in in the 70th minute to put Chelsea ahead for the first time and help extend their lead over Arsenal, who play away at Everton in the late kick-off, to four points. Guro Reiten had cancelled out Sophie Ingle’s own goal in the first half shortly before Berger’s red, but Kerr’s second-half header and Jessie Fleming late strike gave the visiting team the win. If there were banana skins on the path to the league title, with Chelsea four games away from retaining the trophy prior to kick-off, then these back-to-back WSL games against Tottenham, with the teams meeting again at Kingsmeadow on Thursday night, are perhaps the slipperiest. Rehanne Skinner’s Tottenham have fallen out of contention after a strong start to the season, a 10-point gap between themselves and Manchester United in fourth on 38 points, albeit with two games in hand, means that Champions League football is not impossible but extremely unlikely. Having earned a 2-1 win over Manchester City and taken a point off both United and Arsenal, Tottenham have learned how to compete against the league’s best. Liverpool enjoyed a 6-1 win over Sheffield United to cement their promotion and title-winning campaign in the FA Women’s Championship.   At Prenton Park, Katie Stengel scored twice, with Leanne Kiernan, Melissa Lawley, Missy Bo Kearns and Jasmine Matthews also on the scoresheet before the players and staff celebrated with the trophy after the final home game of the season.  With a game to play, London City Lionesses beat Bristol City to climb to second, meaning Bristol City in are in the third promotion place, level on points with Crystal Palace going into the final match of the season next week.  London play Blackburn next week while Bristol City are at Sunderland with Palace away at Sheffield United. Liverpool will sign off with a visit to Lewes.  In front of a strong cluster of home supporters, boosted by local girls’ teams, Spurs began brightly, unwilling to allow the reigning champions a march to the title without a challenge. After 15 minutes they had a shock lead but not an undeserved one as Molly Bartrip’s whipped-in corner ricocheted off the far post then in off the knee of Chelsea midfielder Ingle. Chelsea’s league resilience has been tested before. Emma Hayes’ team had to exercise extreme patience, waiting until the 90th minute for Kerr to give them a narrow win over Aston Villa in March when the team looked to be on the brink of dropping points in a tight title race. The equaliser here was beautiful and came from a player who has thrived as the south-west London side battles a spate of injuries in the latter stage of the campaign. Released by influential midfielder Ji So-yun, Norway forward Reiten nutmegged right-back Ash Neville before clipping a wonderful effort over goalkeeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela from the tightest of angles. There would be further pressure on Chelsea shortly after though. Rachel Williams, who was clean through on the right, took a touch that would have taken her around Berger only for the Chelsea goalkeeper to wipe out the forward and rightly receive a red card. Beth England, who has struggled for starts this season, made way for Swedish goalkeeper Zecira Musovic as Chelsea reshuffled. In a blistering second half both went close, but a stunning save by the backup keeper from Kerys Harrop’s clipped effort kept Chelsea level. With 20 minutes remaining the visiting team took the lead for the first time and the source was familiar. Full-back Jonna Andersson, who had just come on in place of Niamh Charles, picked up Reiten’s pass overlapping on the left before delivering neatly on to the head of Kerr who rose highest to divert beyond Korpela. Substitute Jessie Fleming’s long-range strike into the top corner put the cherry on top as Chelsea took a big step closer to the WSL title.",Sport/Football,Chelsea overcome red card to beat Spurs and open up four-point WSL lead,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/tottenham-chelsea-wsl-match-report
4/25/2022,"Two league victories in the first six months of the season and now two in a matter of four days. There is timing your run to perfection, and then there is what Burnley are doing right now. Mike Jackson had only won back-to-back games as a manager before this week once, and they came against Liverpool’s under-21s and Scunthorpe United while in charge of Tranmere Rovers two years ago. You did not need the roar which accompanied Matej Vydra’s winner here to tell you how this perhaps meant just a little bit more. He may no longer preside over this parish, but the spirit of Sean Dyche still lingers in so much of what Burnley do well. In so many senses this win, their third in a row at home - a feat they have not accomplished for five years - had all the hallmarks of Dyche and the characteristics he instilled at this club during his time in charge. Every last-ditch challenge and every desperate clearance as Burnley hung on in the dying moments was met by a roar from the stands only matched by the home players at full-time here. You did not need to tell anyone what this result means. For 175 days Burnley have been stranded inside the relegation zone and for so many of those days, even the most optimistic supporter would have felt resigned to remaining there. But in one well-crafted move amidst a fairly low-quality affair here, Wout Weghorst’s clever run behind the Wolves defence enabled him to turn the ball inside for Vydra and send Turf Moor into raptures. It is still technically out of Burnley’s hands of course, but they now have the one thing Leeds and Everton do not: momentum. Do not underestimate how important that can be when the majority of your season has been spent yearning for purple patches of form like these. Write them off at your peril now. It is now two wins in four days, and seven points in the three games since Dyche was sacked and Jackson was placed in caretaker charge. Any notion of a swift appointment to replace Dyche has almost certainly been pushed back to the summer: that is if Jackson does not make the decision for the Burnley board himself should he complete the job and guide them a seventh successive season in the Premier League courtesy of the most remarkable of great escapes. Here, Vydra’s strike was enough to see off a fairly timid effort from a Wolves side that may look back on this afternoon as a genuine missed opportunity. As West Ham slipped to defeat at Chelsea elsewhere on Sunday this was a moment to seize for Bruno Lage’s side in their quest for European football next year. In truth, they offered very little to make a compelling case for being in that race here on an underwhelming and frustration afternoon for the visitors. Jackson lined Burnley up in their traditional 4-4-2 with Lage opting for a front three of Hwang Hee-chan, Raúl Jiménez and Fabio Silva. In a first-half of limited clear-cut moments, the best came when Jonny’s driving run down the left forced a smart save from Nick Pope in the Burnley goal. At the other end, Dwight McNeil’s trickery inside the box produced an effort that was handled by José Sá. But with the huge reward of victory for both teams, it felt inevitable that the tempo would fire up somewhat as the second half began. There was certainly more intent and endeavour from Burnley and Wolves after the restart, and it was the hosts who threatened first as a quick ball in behind for Vydra saw him force Sá into a save. The ball ricocheted off Conor Coady and into the Wolves net but the flag correctly went up after Vydra had just crept offside in the build-up. However, Vydra would not be denied as the game entered the final quarter. Weghorst’s clever run behind was picked out, and he had the sight to drive the ball across goal for Vydra to score only his second goal of the season. Whatever happens between now and the end of this thrilling campaign, you suspect he will not score a more important one. The onus now fell on Wolves to respond but as poor as they were in the final third, Burnley were just as tenacious. There were no shortage of crucial last-ditch moments of bravery from the hosts. Connor Roberts hurled himself in front of Hwang as he raced in on goal to deny the forward before the South Korean shot straight at Pope. It was all about Burnley, in truth, who battled and fought with the kind of endeavour that has been missing all too often this season. As we enter the final furlongs of this compelling race to avoid relegation, you’d be brave betting against them now.",Sport/Football,Resurgent Burnley out of bottom three after Vydra hits winner against Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/burnley-wolves-premier-league-match-report
