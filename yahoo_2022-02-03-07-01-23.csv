2/3/2022,"Last week, 27 lawmakers wrote a letter urging leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives to act quickly to bring ""commonsense, bipartisan"" legislation to the floor banning members of Congress from owning or trading stocks. That letter called lawmakers' stock trading a ""glaring problem"" that won't go away until Congress fixes it. While federal lawmakers have unveiled a range of bills aiming to stop lawmakers' from trading stocks, the legislation may face opposition from lawmakers engaged in the behavior it's trying to rein in. In a new interview with Yahoo Finance taped on Jan. 27, progressive Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) alluded to the difficulty of persuading members of Congress to police their own behavior. ""It's not really a mystery to me why it's difficult to pass,"" Ocasio-Cortez, widely known as AOC, told Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief, Andy Serwer, in a wide-ranging interview. ""I wouldn't be surprised if it was a majority of members of Congress who hold and trade individual stock."" The practice of so-called insider trading in Congress has faced widespread criticism in recent years because lawmakers have access to non-public information. Perhaps most notoriously, the Justice Department investigated four senators who sold significant amounts of stock in January and February 2020 as they were being briefed on the looming threat of COVID-19.  While those senators didn't face criminal charges, the investigation highlighted the reality that Congress often has access to inside information that could have a material effect on public companies.  ""I am a member of Congress: Members of Congress have access to very sensitive security clearances,"" Ocasio-Cortez told Yahoo Finance. ""We have access to very detailed, tailored briefs. We, our job is to try to anticipate and legislate for what we see is coming. And we should not have the ability to both have access to that information and be able to hold and trade individual stock.""  While House members can trade stock freely, a 2012 law called the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act bans them from trading on ""material, nonpublic information"" and requires them to disclose trades within 45 days. More than a few lawmakers have violated the STOCK Act, though: A recent investigation by Insider identified 54 lawmakers who failed to comply with the law's reporting requirements.  And in 2020, 75 federal lawmakers held stock in Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) as Congress authorized billions to develop and distribute COVID-19 vaccines made by these very companies, Insider also reported. One bill recently introduced to further curb insider trading in Congress would aim to strengthen the STOCK Act's disclosure rules. Meanwhile, a bill introduced last month by Democratic Senators Mark Kelly of Arizona and Jon Ossoff of Georgia would prohibit lawmakers and their immediate family members from owning or trading stocks. For her part, Ocasio-Cortez favors banning trading altogether, though she stresses that wouldn't prevent Congress members from having a broader stake in the stock market. ""The key here, is that it's not to say that you can't have a retirement account or a college savings account ... a blind trust ... a mutual fund, an index fund,"" she said. ""These are vehicles of investments that are broad, that individual members of Congress don't have direct control over."" Erin Fuchs is deputy managing editor at Yahoo Finance.

2/3/2022,"Now in the home stretch of unloading WarnerMedia, AT&T chief John Stankey appears to be primarily interested in not destroying any more value for shareholders than the telco giant already has with its ill-fated M&A strategy. This week, AT&T announced that the WarnerMedia divestiture will be structured as a spinoff ahead of its combo with Discovery. That will give telco shareholders pro-rata shares in the newly created Warner Bros. Discovery, as the new company is to be called. Click here to sign up for Variety’s free Strictly Business newsletter covering earnings, financial news, and more. Stankey and the board had been mulling a less conventional exit: a split-off of WarnerMedia, which would have forced AT&T shareholders to choose whether to keep their shares in AT&T or exchange them for stock in Warner Bros. Discovery. The goal with a split would have been to reduce AT&T’s outstanding share count, tantamount to a stock buyback by the telco. Analysts say a split-off would have effectively been an immediate referendum on Hollywood’s streaming ambitions — one that AT&T now avoids by doing a simpler spinoff of WarnerMedia. It’s safe to assume a good chunk of AT&T’s retail-heavy shareholder base would not have wanted to trade their stakes in the telco, which pays out an annual cash dividend, in favor of hopping on board a volatile Netflix-like roller coaster. “HBO Max has been doing well — don’t get me wrong,” says Keith Snyder, CFRA Research telecom analyst, of the company’s streaming arm. “But the new company will have lots of debt and require a lot of capital — and with a weak balance sheet, they’re going to be fighting in a really competitive streaming market.” Shares of AT&T dropped 4.2% on Tuesday, as the telco also announced a dividend at the low end of its $8 billion-$9 billion previous guidance. AT&T expects the WarnerMedia spinoff and merger with Discovery to close in the second quarter of 2022 (previously, it had pegged the close for mid-2022), with Discovery CEO David Zaslav set to helm the new media conglom. Per industry chatter, the parties think the transaction could close as soon as early April, though that depends on the Justice Department giving it the thumbs-up. The spinoff distribution “will let the market do what markets do best,” Stankey said in a statement. “We are confident both equities” — AT&T and Warner Bros. Discovery — “will soon be valued on the solid fundamentals and attractive prospects they represent.” At the close, AT&T expects to reap $43 billion from the deal, a sad return on its foray into the media biz after buying Time Warner for nearly $85 billion. At the same time, the new “WBD” plans to assume up to approximately $43 billion of additional debt. AT&T aims to use the proceeds from the WarnerMedia spinoff to pay down net debt, which stood at $156.2 billion at the end of 2021. AT&T is “one of the most heavily debt-laden companies in the United States right now. They need every single dime,” says Snyder. The spinoff is the final major step in AT&T’s plan to slim back down to a pure-play telecommunications provider. In the past two years, it has sold or spun off numerous assets, including DirecTV. Via a deal with TPG, the telco retained a 70% stake in DirecTV and received $7.6 billion in cash (after paying nearly $50 billion for the satcaster). “It’s the corporate equivalent of a garage sale: Everything must go,” says Snyder. “AT&T did an incredible job at buying assets at absolutely peak valuation and destroying valuation in the next few years.” Ultimately, the company accepted that it couldn’t sustain a massive amount of debt while investing in 5G wireless and also keeping pace with the level of content spending by the likes of Netflix and Disney. As far as regulatory approvals, on the fourth-quarter earnings call Stankey reiterated that “we don’t see anything that causes us concern,” noting the deal was cleared in the EU and that AT&T has completed the filing process with the SEC. Under the terms of the pact, AT&T shareholders will hold 71% of the new WBD, while existing Discovery shareholders will own 29%. Some analysts didn’t think the spin-or-split decision really mattered. “We’re not efficient-market zealots, but we’re purist enough to reject the idea that there is any valuation difference whatsoever between spinning and exchanging shares,” Craig Moffett, principal analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note. But it remains to be seen how investors react once the spinoff is complete and the new company’s stock begins trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (under the ticker symbol “WBD”). The new Warner Bros. Discovery is poised to keep investing billions in its streaming strategy, which will continue to be a drag on profitability. For full-year 2022, AT&T projected WarnerMedia would deliver income contribution of about $3 billion — less than half its income contribution of $7.28 billion last year. On the earnings call, chief financial officer Pascal Desroches said 2022 is expected to be the “peak investment year” for HBO Max. Stankey felt obliged to caution that the WarnerMedia deal won’t be an instant windfall for AT&T shareholders. “As I said when we announced the transaction,” he said on the Q4 call, “this isn’t going to be something that’s going to ultimately manifest and unlock the value overnight.” Best of Variety What's Coming to Disney Plus in February 2022 Everything Coming to Netflix in February 2022 2022 Oscars Predictions: The Collective - Where Does the Race Stand After a Super Tuesday of Guild Nominations?",Business/Variety•5 hours ago,"With Spinoff, AT&T Picks Safer Exit for WarnerMedia",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spinoff-t-picks-safer-exit-173043371.html
