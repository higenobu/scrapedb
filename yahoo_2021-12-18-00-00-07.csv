12/18/2021,"An Iowa judge has just made sure that Steven Vogel will spend the rest of his life behind bars for killing a Black man in Michael Williams in 2020. After a jury voted to convict him of first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse, the murderer received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Judge Shawn Showers gave the news to Vogel and his legal team on Monday, Dec. 13. At the sentencing hearing, the District 8A judge called him “a cold-blooded murderer with hate in his heart.” He continued, “These sentences are made for people like you who commit these horrific offenses and take others’ lives without any regard for consequences.” On September 16, 2020, the body of Michael Williams was found burning in a ditch in rural Jasper County. Medical examiners determined that Williams was killed four days before the corpse was burned, and that he died by strangulation. Four people were arrested in connection to this murder: Steven Vogel, 31, Julia Cox, 55, Roy Garner, 57, and Cody Johnson, 29. Vogel knew Williams for several years and was changed with his death. The other three people, all white, were charged with abuse of a corpse, destruction of evidence, and as accessories to the crime. The motive for the killing was reportedly linked to a “love triangle” between Vogel, his girlfriend, and Williams. The State suggested that Vogel was jealous of Williams and had sent Facebook messages days before the murder to a friend about his desire to kill the 44-year-old man. Three people also testified that Vogel told them that he killed “Black Mike.” One witness shared that Williams was clubbed in the head before he was hung by a rope in Vogel’s basement. In review of the crime, the judge also said to Vogel, “You’re why Iowa has life without the possibility of parole. You don’t deserve to be on the streets. You don’t deserve to see a parole board. You are a dangerous cold-blooded killer.” “You’ll have the rest of your life to think about what you did, the loss and the pain that you caused, and the precious life that you ended,” he remarked. “You treated Michael Williams like he was not human,” Showers continued. “You clubbed him. Strangled him to death. Kept him in your basement like an animal that you would kill. You wrapped up his body, set it on fire. And you dehumanized Michael Williams. And Mr. Williams did not deserve that.” The judge offered Vogel an opportunity to say something in defense of himself. He chose not to. However, Williams’ family shared their sentiments in the courtroom and directed their words to the man that took their loved one’s life. Michael’s son Dante Williams said “You thought you would get away with what you did. You thought people didn’t care enough about him to research and find out what really happened. That is not the case. There’s a lot of love behind my father.” The deceased’s father, James Williams, also spoke. He expressed how much he wanted to hurt Vogel. “You burned his body. Threw him in a ditch like he was garbage,” his words simmered as he said. “You’re very lucky that I’m holding myself back from jumping over this thing and breaking your neck.” One of the last voices from the family to speak about the impact of the murder was Michael’s maternal aunt, Paula Terrell. She shared that her sister, Michael’s mother, had a stroke from the stress of his death and now lives in a nursing facility, relearning how to walk. She further emphasized how depressed her sister has become. “In some ways, I’m glad my sister was not able to travel here for the trial. I am sure the state’s pictures of her [son’s body and autopsy] would have caused her demise,” the aunt remarked. “How do you tell your sister that the graphic pictures we all have seen of Emmett Till pales in comparison to the pictures of her son?” Police investigating the crime assert that race was not a factor in his death. Still, the family has maintained that it is, calling his death a “lynching” and connecting Williams’ death to Till’s by bringing the unique similarities in the two Black males’ death. “It’s putting that rope around his neck and holding it for over six minutes, causing his death, is the definition of a hanging. A lynching,” Terrell said in November. “A white man lynched a Black man over a white woman.” More news from our partners: Oklahoma Black Man Found Buried Under Septic Tank After Employer’s Lies About His Whereabouts Are Exposed By Victim’s Daughter, Police “Regaining Our Trust And Respect Was Essential” | Urban Meyer Out At Jacksonville In Under A Year Video: Blacks and Whites Clash Outside of South African High School At Protest Over Alleged Whites-Only Dance",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘I’m Holding Myself Back’: Father Lashes Out During Sentencing Hearing of White Man Who Hanged and Torched His Son,https://news.yahoo.com/m-holding-myself-back-father-133000349.html
12/18/2021,"In 1999, Pastor Kenneth Copeland built a 18,000 square-foot mansion in Texas. Texas law means that by calling it a ""parsonage"" Copeland avoids an annual $150,000 property tax. Copeland is worth $750 million and is the head of the Eagle Mountain International Church. America's wealthiest pastor avoided paying more than $150,000 in annual taxes on his $7 million Texas mansion, according to the Houston Chronicle. Kenneth Copeland, a famous televangelist who founded Eagle Mountain International Church, built a six-bedroom mansion near Fort Worth in 1999. Copeland is worth $750 million and owns multiple properties and several private jets, the Chronicle said. The jets are housed at a nearby airport named after him. Under Texas law, pastor's homes, known as parsonages, get a 100% exemption from property tax. Local authorities said Copeland is within his rights to claim the house as a parsonage, even though the law was likely never intend to cover super-rich religious figures like him. ""It definitely looks out of place and unusual compared to other parsonages we have,"" Jeff Law, Tarrant County's chief appraiser, told the Chronicle. ""But from what I can gather through the law, and my understanding, it qualifies as a parsonage just like the little house next to the church would."" In a 2015 sermon, Copeland said God told him to build the 18,000-square-feet house for his wife Gloria, the Chronicle said. ""It is part of your prosperity,"" God told him, he said. To qualify for the exemption, parsonages can only be one acre in size — which this one technically is. The property exists on its own plot that fulfills the one-acre limit, but Copeland purchased 24 acres more of lakefront tract surrounding the property. Valued at $125,000 — a fraction of the house — it attracts an annual tax bill of $3,000, the Chronicle said. Copeland is proud of his wealth, which he attributes to gas reserves on his estates. He has also been criticized for the way he manages it. ""The law was never intended to give breaks to millionaires and multimillionaires,"" Pete Evans, president of the Trinity Foundation, a nonprofit focused on transparency in religious organizations, told the Chronicle: ""You make a mockery of the law itself."" Kenneth Copeland Ministries didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawrence Swicegood, a spokesman for Eagle Mountain International Church, told the Chronicle that the institution ""always abides by biblical guidelines. Our church also adheres to the various federal, state, county and local codes, statutes and ordinances applicable to the church ministry."" The local district set the value of Copeland's mansion at $10.8 million in 2020, the Chronicle said, but the church protested and it was lowered back to $7 million in 2021. The discovery was made as part of a sweeping investigation by the Chronicle into the finances of prominent religious figures in Texas.

12/18/2021,"It’s an all-too-common event: The friend or family member you just met with tells you they tested positive for COVID-19. Maybe you had gathered for a holiday event. Maybe you just met for dinner or drinks. You were probably indoors and unmasked. Or maybe one of your children’s classmates just tested positive. Regardless of the circumstances, don’t panic and get tested. There are established best practices to minimize your risk and keep your loved ones safe as the Omicron variant picks up steam across the U.S. Here’s what Yahoo News medical contributor Dr. Lucy McBride advises if you’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19, particularly for parents or guardians with school-age children. (Some responses have been edited for clarity.) Yahoo News: What should people do if they learn that they were around someone who tested positive for COVID-19? Dr. Lucy McBride: For people who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, if they remain asymptomatic, without any symptoms, it’s important to get a PCR test three to five days after the last exposure. ... The PCR test will turn positive before a rapid antigen test ... but they can also use rapid antigen tests as a sort of day pass to tell them in the days three to 14 during the incubation period, whether or not they’re carrying infectious levels of virus in their nose; the tests are pretty good at ruling that out. Does the Omicron variant affect COVID-19 testing? The Omicron variant is more contagious, so we can expect to see more household transmission, for example, because people are living in close quarters, but Omicron doesn’t change the testing landscape. It just means we need more readily accessible, rapid antigen tests for people who have been exposed but who are not symptomatic. What should a parent or guardian do if a child or teen was exposed to COVID-19 at school? A close contact is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as someone who has been in the same room closer than 6 feet for more than 15 minutes over a 24-hour period. So just because a child has been exposed to a COVID-19 case at school doesn’t mean that the person necessarily had an exposure as defined by CDC. If a child is exposed to a person with COVID-19, what to do next really depends on whether they are vaccinated. If the child is unvaccinated, they need to stay home and isolate for 14 days unless the school has in place the “test-to-stay” program, which allows students to go to school if they, on that day, test negative with a rapid antigen test. If your child is vaccinated and has been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, the CDC says that there’s no need to quarantine that child, but they should probably get tested three to five days after the last exposure with a PCR test to make sure they aren’t carrying the virus asymptomatically in their nose. It’s really important to allow us to keep healthy, nonsymptomatic kids [who have been exposed to COVID-19] in school ... that we roll out a test-to-stay program in all schools in the country, whereby kids who have been exposed can take a rapid antigen test. And if it’s negative, that tells us that they are safe to go to school; they are not carrying infectious levels of virus in their nose, such that they pose a danger to other people in the school. What should a parent or guardian do if a child or teen ends up testing positive for COVID-19? If your child tests positive for COVID-19, first of all, it’s important to know that that child is very likely to do extremely well, especially if they’re vaccinated, because most kids, even if they’re unvaccinated, tend to do well with COVID-19. The second thing is to alert any close contacts. So anyone who has been in close contact with that child starting 48 hours before symptoms began or before the positive test, whichever came first, needs to be alerted that they’re at potential risk for COVID-19.",Health/Yahoo News,What to do if you're exposed to someone with COVID-19,https://news.yahoo.com/what-to-do-if-youre-exposed-to-someone-with-covid-19-162310790.html
12/18/2021,"A Taylor Swift album party in Sydney, Australia, appears to have been a superspreader event, with authorities issuing an urgent warning after the party was connected to nearly 100 Covid cases. In a public health alert issued on Thursday, the New South Wales Ministry of Health said it had been notified of a ""venue of concern"" in Sydney connected to at least 97 confirmed cases of Covid-19. The health ministry said that anyone who attended the ""On Repeat: Taylor Swift Red Party"" at the Metro Theatre from 9 p.m. local time on Friday Dec. 10 is considered a ""close contact"" of a positive Covid case and ""must immediately get tested and isolate for 7 days."" The health ministry said it was likely that at least some of the cases identified were the omicron variant. NSW Health said it was also asking all household contacts of those at the event to get tested and self-isolate until a negative result is received by everyone in the household. It said it was ""urgently contacting"" at least 600 people who checked into the event via a QR code. Anyone who did not use the QR code, it said, should ""urgently get tested and isolate."" The health ministry also asked that the broader community work to ""ensure other potential attendees are aware of this advice."" In the wake of the incident, NSW Health said it wanted to remind ""everyone of the importance of maintaining Covid-safe practices as transmission is occurring at social events during the festive period."" ""Everyone should remain vigilant when celebrating with family, friends and colleagues and should not attend any social functions if they have any symptoms,"" it said. Cases in New South Wales have surged in recent days, from a 7-day average of 214 cases identified a day at the start of the month to a 7-day average of 1,091 as of Thursday, according to data maintained by the Johns Hopkins University. NSW Health said penalties for non-compliance with isolation, testing and quarantine rules have been increased from $1,000 for individuals to $5,000, with penalties for corporations rising from $5,000 to $10,000. The superspreader event also comes as countries around the world grapple with a surge in Covid cases amid the spread of the omicron variant. On Thursday, President Joe Biden warned of a ""winter of severe illness and death"" for those who are not vaccinated against Covid-19 amid a surge in delta infections and as omicron spreads. The warning came after a briefing with advisers, with the president warning omicron is ""now spreading and it's going to increase.""

12/18/2021,"Fox News’ Sean Hannity announced Thursday he’d be off the air until 2022, days after bombshell revelations about a private text message he sent then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows during the storming of the U.S. Capitol. Hannity appeared to catch colleague Laura Ingraham unaware with news of his holiday during the handover of their shows. “I’m coming back ready for a political fight,” vowed the Trump apologist, who in his Jan. 6 text to Meadows urged him to get then-President Donald Trump to call off the violent mob of his supporters. “On vacation, I try to center myself, find God, and then get my creative juices flowing, and I already know where I’m headed,” Hannity told Ingraham. “I know next year is the biggest most important midterm election year in our lives and I’m going to be focused like a laser beam.” Ingraham likened his comments to a framed poster on a corporate wall. While going on holiday ahead of the festive season is normal, Twitter users noted how personalities on the network have a history of getting into hot water and then taking time off. Sean Hannity announces during his handoff with Laura Ingraham that tonight is his last show of the year and he will be on vacation until after the New Year.
