3/25/2022,"China reported almost 5,000 Covid-19 cases on Friday, as authorities continued to battle an outbreak of the highly transmissible Omicron variant across multiple provinces and as evidence of frustration among the population grew. After the death of a nurse in Shanghai who was denied hospitalisation after suffering an asthma attack, many are angry that China’s Covid responses appear to be causing more deaths than the virus itself. On Friday, health authorities reported 4,988 cases, with rising numbers of asymptomatic infections, which China records separately. There is growing concern in Shanghai, where health officials in the city of about 25 million people reported 1,609 cases on Friday. Just over 1,500 cases were asymptomatic, marking a sharp increase from the previous day’s 979. Shanghai’s authorities have resisted going into city-wide lockdown, a harsh measure still being used in other provinces, and are instead closing individual buildings and communities for testing. But some residents have claimed they’ve been locked down for far longer than warned, and others reported issues in securing fresh food and other deliveries. “2+2+2+2+2, the lockdown days has been infinitely increased by two,” complained one resident. “Policies change every day, prices rise every day. I have to get up at 5 o’clock every day to grab food. It is still unknown whether it can be delivered. This is how our government treats its citizens?” On Wednesday a nurse in Shanghai died after she was denied entry to hospitals after suffering an asthma attack, echoing the cases of people who died during a lockdown in Xi’an last year after they were denied medical care because of overly strict Covid policies. Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai municipal health commission, offered condolences to the nurse’s family and urged hospitals to better streamline their screening and sterilisation processes, which were keeping hospital areas closed for too long. China has reported two Covid-19 deaths from this Omicron outbreak, and some online discussion has centred around “secondary” deaths caused by harsh anti-epidemic measures. “I am not afraid of the coronavirus, I am afraid that I can’t get treatment for other diseases,” said one person on Weibo. “I really don’t know why people who should be treated cannot get treated? How many lives will it take to change our one-size-fits-all policy?” said another. Across China authorities have imposed various measures as they seek to implement orders from the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, to ensure “the maximum prevention and control at the least cost, and minimise the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development”. Last week Wang Hesheng, vice-head of the National Health Commission, said China’s increasingly refined tactics had reduced inconvenience. But frustration is building. Last week social media posts went viral of crowds in Shenyang banging against shop windows and shouting in frustration at the announcement of another round of testing. And while entire provinces like Jilin have been locked down, the resistance to do so in cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen have prompted accusations they are “dragging down” the response effort. “Other cities took a month to control the epidemic, Shanghai grows epidemic in one month,” said one online commenter. On Wednesday “Why can’t China lift safety measure just like foreign countries?” was a top trending topic on Weibo, according to What’s On Weibo. Viewed more than 5.4m times, the hashtag drew debate over views recently put forward by epidemiologist Liang Wannian, who supports Xi’s zero-Covid strategy, against comments by a Beijing hospital director, Jiang Rongmeng, that Omicron was “more like a cold”.",News/World news,"Frustration with China’s Covid response grows as daily cases near 5,000",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/frustration-with-chinas-covid-response-grows-as-daily-cases-near-5000
3/25/2022,"New South Wales authorities are moving extra rescue personnel and equipment into the flood-hit regions of the state’s north as more wild weather looms. The Bureau of Meteorology on Friday afternoon issued a severe weather warning for heavy rain for areas that are still recovering from floods at the start of March, as well as storms near Sydney. Towns or cities at risk of flash flooding on Friday included Lismore, Gosford, Tenterfield, Byron Bay, Casino and Kyogle. ⛈️Slow-moving storms continue to bring a heavy rainfall threat, including near Colo Heights and Bilpin. A severe thunderstorm warning is current for the Northern Rivers, Northern Tablelands and Central West Slopes & Plains.See latest at https://t.co/o8lF3WGlu3 pic.twitter.com/Q9lQN71Ro0 The immediate source of the storm activity was a humid and unstable airmass east of an inland trough, the bureau said. An approaching upper trough would enhance the thunderstorms, leading to rapid development. However, there was the possibility of several troughs moving across the region in coming days, with the bureau also monitoring the potential for a low-pressure system forming off the coast early next week, Morgan Pumpa, a BoM spokesperson said. Similar warnings for heavy rainfall and damaging have been issued for southern parts of Queensland, including just north of the NSW border. The floods that hit northern NSW and south-east Queensland at the end of February were mostly from a single, extended rainfall event. For Sydney, twin east coast lows within a week caused major dams to spill, and lifted the Hawkesbury Nepean River to the city’s north and west to its highest levels since 1978 in places. For now, the forecast for Sydney is for showers every day over the next week, with the biggest total predicted for Sunday, with as much as 30mm to fall. Early next week may see some of the biggest falls of the next few days, the bureau said. Each day will see rainfall over parts of the north-east, with Monday and Tuesday looking like having the most accumulated falls (although local areas under a 'super cell' will likely pick up more.) @BOM_NSW pic.twitter.com/uX43nFfHk8 “At the moment, the focus is really over the upcoming days,” Pumpa said. “But during the first half of next week, a trough is expected to develop along the central and northern parts of New South Wales coast.” “While the system is forecast to bring widespread rainfall across eastern NSW, rainfall totals aren’t expected to be as high as what we saw in late February and early March,” he said. Early indications are that the northern rivers region – which copped severe flooding that forced thousands from their homes and killed at least four people – may collect as much as 200mm of rain, if not 300mm, Pumpa said. What will be key is if the system moves a bit closer to the coast than currently forecast. Can see why SES and other authorities are getting a bit nervous about the return of flooding to parts of the east coast. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/yqOYFM6VaN The NSW State Emergency Service was deploying more crews with flood rescue capability to the mid-north coast and the north-east ahead of the coming rain, including incident managements teams. “This is a very dynamic weather pattern which it has been for the last couple of weeks now,” said Greg Nash, an SES spokesperson. “We are definitely preparing and resourcing appropriately,” including sending crews up north. “The majority of them are currently centred around the Grafton area.” He said if needed, they can be sent to other regions. “The ground is all extremely saturated at the moment,” he said. “So, even a small intense rain period, localised, may trigger some flash flooding.” Sydney’s dams, meanwhile, remain more than 99% full, with only about 20 gigalitres of additional capacity left across the network, WaterNSW data shows. There are also warnings for storm activity around the Hawkesbury region. Also stormy across parts of Sydney this Friday afternoon, with heavy rainfall possible: @BOM_NSW https://t.co/AP2lGq6VWR pic.twitter.com/BTcH5HSm1X Longer term, the La Niña weather pattern that has contributed to the above-average rainfall is not forecast to break up until late autumn, Pumpa said.

3/25/2022,"The arrival of spring has seemingly immutable rituals – lengthening days, blossoming plants and a surge in bees’ activity. But the onset of spring is now being warped by the climate crisis, with new research finding that many species of birds are nesting and laying eggs nearly a month earlier than they did a century ago. US scientists who analyzed the nesting trends of birds from egg samples collected in the Chicago area found that of the 72 species for which historical and modern data exists, around a third are now nesting much earlier in the year than before. These species, including bluejays, yellow warblers and field sparrows, are now laying their first eggs 25 days earlier, on average, than they were 100 years ago, the research found. The heating of the atmosphere, due to the burning of fossil fuels, is seemingly upending a process that long appeared unshakeable. “It was shocking to find this,” said John Bates, curator of birds at the Field Museum and the study’s lead author. “What we can see is clearly pointing in the direction that climate change is having a significant effect on the behavior of birds. It’s another piece of the puzzle we are trying to figure out in terms of impacts.” The study, published in the Journal of Animal Ecology, drew upon records of birds’ eggs gathered during a period, from about 1880 to 1920, when people could rampantly collect them from nests without penalty. These records, largely consisting of boxes of eggs with hand-written labels describing the type of bird and when the eggs were collected, were compared with modern nesting data collated by Bill Strausberger, a colleague of Bates’ at the Field Museum, and Chris Whelan, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Whelan and his team used mirrors mounted on long poles to peer into high-up nests. A model built by the researchers revealed that birds moving their nesting dates forward has been closely correlated with rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, a leading driver of rising global temperatures. Birds choose when to nest in line with other developments in spring, such as the budding of plants and the increase in insect numbers. These interactions of nature are being unpicked by climate change – in the US bears are emerging from hibernation earlier and cherry, peach, pear, apple and plum trees are blossoming weeks earlier than they once did. In the UK, plants flowered a full month earlier between 1987 and 2019 than they did before 1986, recent research found. “If you’re a bird and you nest earlier, you put yourself at risk of these cold snaps that can still arrive in spring, which then affects the plants and insects,” said Bates. “That then impacts the reproductive success of the birds. Springs are becoming more volatile and that is taking its toll.” Bates said more research needed to be done but the scrambling of the seasons may well be a significant factor in the decline of many bird species, along with other factors such as habitat loss and the indiscriminate use of pesticides. In 2020, a study revealed that nearly 3 billion birds had disappeared from the US and Canada since 1970, a loss of nearly a third of all bird numbers. Researchers said the losses have been “staggering”, with the declines heaviest among sparrows, blackbirds, warblers and finches.",News/Environment,"Many bird species nesting and laying eggs nearly a month early, study says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/25/birds-nesting-laying-eggs-early-climate-crisis-study
3/25/2022,"Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine was a pivotal moment for Poland: proof positive it had been right about Russia all along, and the start of an immense national humanitarian effort. For its government, it is also an opportunity to score some points in Brussels. Poland has “never had such an excellent brand, all over the world”, its prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, declared last week. It is “in the right position in international politics”, he said, no longer behind a “wall of unfair isolation”. The US president, Joe Biden, is due to visit the country on Friday. Mired in a bitter seven-year standoff with the EU over democratic backsliding and the rule of law, the government in Warsaw – whose populist brand of national-conservatism has also strained relations with Washington – now hopes the fallout from Vladimir Putin’s war will finally oblige the bloc to cut it some slack. In particular, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, whose popularity is on the rise again after sliding for 18 months, wants Brussels to unlock €36bn (£30bn) in pandemic recovery funds blocked over concerns about whether Warsaw can guarantee it will spend EU money properly because of its politicised judiciary. But while the Polish government is clearly seeking to capitalise on the country’s newfound good-guy status – and may well win some short-term favour – Warsaw’s longer-term conflict with the EU is unlikely to disappear, analysts say. “PiS may be saying: ‘Look, there’s a real dictator out there, waging a real war – that’s all that matters and that’s what we should all be concentrating on right now,’” said Aleks Szczerbiak, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex. “But at some stage there will be a negotiated peace, or the war will sink into one of attrition and fall out of the spotlight. More normal patterns will resume. And the underlying causes of Poland’s rule-of-law dispute with the EU are not going away.” Scarred by centuries of Russian aggression and occupation culminating in nearly half a century of communist dictatorship, Poland has long warned the EU of the threat from Moscow, especially since the time of Putin’s 2014 invasion of Crimea. The nationalist PiS-led government’s constant recent rowing with Brussels, its culture-war attacks on LGBTQ+ people and abortion rights and its bridge-building with anti-EU, pro-Putin figures such as Italy’s Matteo Salvini and France’s Marine Le Pen may have slightly muddied the picture. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was nonetheless a historic “we told you so” moment for Poland, said Ben Stanley, a political scientist at the SWPS University in Warsaw. It meant Warsaw could try to position itself as “the capital that had been warning this would happen” for years. As Putin’s aggression shifted the EU’s centre of gravity eastward, the crisis “creates an opportunity for Poland to stake a claim to being a regional leader”, Stanley said. “It’s determined to show itself as taking the lead in persuading a reluctant west to take tougher action; stiffening resolve in a very public way.” Morawiecki’s visit to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after the invasion was seen by many as instrumental in Germany’s about-turn on arms shipments, defence spending, and financial sanctions. The visit by Morawiecki and the PiS leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, this month to embattled Kyiv “on behalf of the EU”, alongside the Czech and Slovenian prime ministers, underscored the strategy. Poland has also been tougher than any other EU member state on sanctions in calling for a total embargo on all trade with Russia. It also proposed a Nato peacekeeping force in Ukraine, and stepped up to become the main transit point for western shipments of arms, munitions and military equipment to Ukraine. The country’s immense humanitarian effort – albeit widely acknowledged as more due to the extraordinary generosity and mobilisation of civil society than to central government – in taking in more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees is also being touted by some politicians as grounds for EU leniency. A recent poll for Oko.press showed 66% of Poles wanted the government to accept EU rule of law rules and end its dispute with Brussels – including nearly one in three PiS voters. But 56% also said the funds should now be released without conditions, bolstering a potential PiS narrative that Poland should get the money with no strings attached because it has welcomed so many refugees. “There’s a strategy to emotionally blackmail the EU into taking a softer line,” said Stanley. “An attempt to refashion the discourse, to say: ‘We’re trying to deal with real problems; you’re just hindering us with all this rule-of-law stuff.’” Szczerbiak said PiS had long pursued a twin-track strategy towards the EU of accepting inevitable conflict over rule-of-law and culture-war issues, while at the same time insisting Poland was being a “positive, constructive EU member” on the subjects that really matter. “In a sense, the war has actually reinforced that discourse,” he said. “It means Warsaw can say: ‘OK, so there’s a lot we disagree on. But on the really important stuff, look what good Europeans we are.’ It means there’s now huge pressure on both sides to de-escalate.” Some in Brussels believe Poland, which has put the cost of welcoming refugees from Ukraine at €2.2bn this year alone, could ask for special compensation, perhaps similar to the deal the EU struck with Turkey after the 2015 refugee crisis. But EU officials also say the Polish government now has a bigger opportunity to close long-festering disputes with Brussels over the rule of law which have led to €1m daily fines and the freezing of the country’s pandemic recovery fund. Warsaw’s plan for the fund could be approved within weeks, EU officials say, if Poland moves ahead with a promise to abolish the disciplinary tribunal of the supreme court, a system of political control that violates EU law. Danuta Hübner, an MEP for the centre-right opposition Civic Platform party and former EU commissioner, said she was proud of Polish civil society’s refugee effort but accused the government of being “entirely absent”. She said Poland needed the recovery funds “as quickly as possible” but still had a long way to go to unlock them. Abuse of the rule of law was “ongoing”, she said, adding that the commission should approve the plan only if Poland’s supreme court was properly reformed. Robert Biedroń, a centre-left opposition MEP, said it would be outrageous if the commission defied “the mainstream and the will of the citizens of the county”, as well as the European parliament, by not sticking to conditions to release the funds. He said he would “fight very hard” for EU funds for refugee support, but warned against releasing other EU money without ensuring Warsaw rolls back recent changes to the court system that undermine judicial independence. “The rule of law cannot be another victim of this war,” he said. “How would we explain the difference between us and Putin if we don’t respect the rule of law?” Ultimately, said Andrzej Bobińnski and Wojciech Szacki of the Polityka Insight thinktank, the war could be “a cathartic moment” for Poland’s political class – but it was still “too early to tell if this means a U-turn for Poland back toward the liberal west”. Some PiS politicians may want peace with Brussels, they argued, others insist the war shows precisely how “the west was wrong, how it needs Poland, and how Poland now has the upper hand in security, humanitarian, and European issues”. PiS would certainly not hesitate to exploit any EU reluctance to pay up, Stanley said – especially once the enormous future cost of housing, educating and employing 2 million refugees becomes a political reality.",News/World news,Will Poland’s good-guy status on Ukraine help its standing in the EU?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/poland-ukraine-russia-eu
3/25/2022,"Some Ukrainian refugees have described being forced to return to Ukraine because of protracted delays in securing UK visas, while others are living in underground bomb shelters in Kyiv, dismayed by the long wait for visas to be processed. A month after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 10 million people are believed to have left their homes, of whom 3.6 million are thought to have left for neighbouring countries, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The Home Office has granted 18,600 visas to Ukrainian relatives of UK citizens, but there is rising frustration among those who have applied for visas under the government’s two schemes – a family process and sponsorship programme – many of whom describe long delays without any way of knowing the status of their applications. Some refugees are stuck because their passports are believed to be locked up in a UK visa processing centre in Kyiv, which has now been closed due to the fighting. Others are worried because they are running out of money to pay hotel bills while they wait. Some families have been split because visas have been granted at different times. British national Nadiia Mackowiak, a London-based interpreter, is puzzled that visas have been granted to her father, sister and five-year-old niece, while her mother, Nadiia Pavlenko, is still waiting, 18 days after applying. “My parents had to leave Kyiv after a missile hit their home; they saw their block burning and falling down. My mother is in very bad way, and is desperate to be with us here,” she said. Her sister and niece have traveled to the UK, but her father and her mother, who ran a nursery in Kyiv until earlier this year, are still in Poland, staying with strangers who have given them a room. Her mother has twice been issued with UK visas previously. “It’s hard to understand what the problem is; it’s too much bureaucracy. These people have fled a war.” Sandip Basu, a volunteer legal adviser with the Ukraine Advice Project, said he had advised one family of refugees who fled Ukraine in late February and applied for UK visas Budapest, but were forced to return to Ukraine while they waited two weeks for the visas to be processed “It was clearly a dangerous measure but they could not afford to remain in Budapest,” he said. Since 6 March, Michelle Potts has been in a rented one-bedroom flat in Bucharest with her 72-year-old mother-in-law Olga Selivanova, who uses a wheelchair, and her 12-year-old twin godchildren, who have left their village on the outskirts of Kyiv. “We were told it would take five days to process their applications on 9 March, but we’re still waiting. The children don’t understand why it’s taking so long. The UK visa system isn’t fit for purpose at the best of times; it’s certainly not fit for emergencies.” Tatiana Dembicka, 73, a retired university administrator from Kyiv, has been waiting since 4 March for her application to join her son, Eugene, a British citizen in the UK. Her case was raised with the home secretary and with the minister for refugees Lord Harrington by her son’s MP Lucy Frazer, and she was told that a decision had been made on Tuesday, however her family was still waiting on Thursday for an emailing explaining what the decision was. “I can’t see why there is such a delay between a decision and notification,” her son-in-law Karl Dembicki said. “We feel embarrassed by the government’s lack of empathy.” Several people described technical and practical difficulties with the Homes for Ukraine application form. One man said the woman he was hoping to sponsor was living in an underground shelter in Kyiv, and unable to return to her flat to collect documents required for the form. “It is nerve-racking. The situation in Kyiv is not great. Due to the lack of the required document, we’re not sure what the outcome of the visa application will be, but we’re hoping for the best,” he said. Clare Birkbeck, who is studying for a masters, said she was one of a group of about 10 families in Saffron Walden, Suffolk, trying to host refugees; she hopes to host Katryn Zakharchuk 35 and her son Alexander Zakharchuk 15. “It’s a black hole of stress. Katryn and her son are sleeping on the floor of a room in Krakow, belonging to a very kind Polish man, with six people, unable to access funds from their Ukrainian bank. We’ve had no further communication since submitting the form; you just have to wait. They are desperate and I’m unable to help because of the shambolic system.” Lucy Ward, a writer, said she had spent over seven hours grappling with forms to sponsor two mothers and two children over the weekend. “There are a lot of baffled people; I speak Russian and I’m used to filling in visa forms, but I still found it confusing,” she said, adding that there was a lot of pressure on hosts to make it work. “It’s so devolved. It’s like a Victorian charity or a knit-your-own refugee scheme. I know it’s been done quickly, but there has to be a better way.” The refugees are currently staying in a school sports hall in Poland. “We’ve been told nothing about how long it might take,” she said. Robina Qureshi, director of the refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said her charity was assisting 415 who were trying to be matched with UK sponsors. “No one is getting visas from the families we are helping. Many families are living in war zones in Ukraine and won’t leave until they know they can travel to the UK. The UK’s visa approach to refugees is putting them at additional risk; under the refugee convention they don’t need a visa,” she said. The local government associations said it was still waiting to be given guidance on exactly how and when safety checks on sponsors’ homes should be done. A government spokesperson said changes had been made to simplify the visa application forms, adding: “We are very aware that many people fleeing Putin’s invasion will not have certain documents with them. While such documents can aid the application process, our case workers are taking a compassionate, commonsense approach.”",News/World news,Ukrainian refugees: frustration grows over long wait times for UK visas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/ukrainian-refugees-frustration-grows-over-long-wait-times-for-uk-visas
