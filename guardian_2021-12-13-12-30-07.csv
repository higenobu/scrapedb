12/13/2021,"As domestic border rules eased on Monday, Covid-19 infections continued to grow, with Victoria reporting 1,290 new cases and two deaths, while New South Wales recorded 536 new cases, amid increasing numbers of the Omicron variant. Health authorities in NSW are battling to contain several large transmission events, including cases of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant – with 64 cases of the new strain now recorded in the state.  Of the 536 new cases announced in the state on Monday, nine were confirmed to have the Omicron variant, with NSW Health saying “more are expected as results of genomic testing are confirmed”. The number of cases linked to an outbreak at Newcastle’s Argyle House nightclub spiked from 24 to 84 overnight and “a number of these cases are likely to be the Omicron variant”, the health department said. Four people who partied at the club on Wednesday had Covid-19, with the cases linked to the outbreak stemming from a Sydney harbour cruise of 140 people on 3 December. All 680 people who checked into the Newcastle nightclub with a QR code between 9pm on Wednesday and 3am on Thursday are close contacts and must immediately get tested and isolate for seven days. NSW’s double-dose vaccination rate of those aged 16 and older remains at 93.1%, while 94.8% per cent of people have had their first jab. There are 171 people in NSW hospitals with the virus, 24 of them in intensive care. In Victoria, the 1290 new infections and two deaths came as medical researchers discovered that three people from a Melbourne household had contracted Covid-19 for a second time, one year after first becoming infected. They tested positive for the virus in July 2020, with two of the three showing mild symptoms and the third reporting no symptoms, according to a study published in the Medical Journal of Australia on Monday. The variant they contracted was not of concern. Then all three contracted the Delta strain of Covid-19 in July this year, but only experienced mild symptoms. While less than 1% of people are believed to get second infections, the researchers are urging people who have contracted the virus to still get vaccinated. “Just because you’ve had Covid-19 and recovered from it doesn’t make you immune,’’ said Monash University epidemiologist Mohana Baptista. “You’re still at risk of getting Covid-19. Our only protection at the moment is the vaccination.’’ Victoria is now managing 11,649 active cases, despite 92% of residents aged 12 and older having had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. There are 323 patients in hospitals in Victoria, 77 of whom are actively infected with the virus in intensive care and 40 needing ventilation. There are three Omicron cases in Victoria – a returned traveller from the Netherlands who is in hotel quarantine and two people who sat together in the same row on a flight from Dubai to Melbourne on 30 November. Victoria has lowered quarantine requirements for travellers from several countries of concern. Double-vaccinated travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe are no longer required to undertake 14 days in hotel quarantine upon arrival. They must instead self-quarantine for 72 hours, and get tested within 24 hours of arrival and again between days five and seven, like other international travellers. Meanwhile, the wait time to receive a Covid-19 booster shot has been reduced from six months to five to help tackle the new strain. Epidemiologist Raina MacIntyre from the University of NSW’s Kirby Institute says adults need to start thinking about three shots of a Covid-19 vaccination as being the number required to be fully vaccinated. “Thinking you’re fine with two doses, if Omicron is going to spread in Australia, is a false sense of security,” she told ABC radio on Monday. Early data indicated that, even after three doses, antibody levels “start to wane pretty quickly as well”. “So it may well be that we need another, fourth dose within less than a year,” MacIntyre said.",News/World news,Australia Covid update: Omicron variant spreading rapidly as NSW and Victoria cases grow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/australia-covid-update-omicron-variant-spreading-rapidly-as-nsw-and-victoria-cases-grow
