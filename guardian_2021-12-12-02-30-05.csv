12/12/2021,"Chelsea’s title challenge was on the verge of unravelling. Unable to hold on to a lead, their sheen of defensive invulnerability has disappeared and Thomas Tuchel looked short of answers when Joe Gelhardt equalised for Marcelo Bielsa’s vibrant Leeds United side a minute after coming off the bench. Tuchel simply folded back into his seat in the dugout when the ball went in. Chelsea, who had fought from behind to lead, had asked for it. They have conceded eight times in their last three matches and were in danger of slipping away from Manchester City and Liverpool at the top.  But there was more drama to come. A frantic game had entered stoppage time when another Leeds substitute, Mateusz Klich, was deemed to have brought down Antonio Rüdiger just inside the area. Rüdiger had already won one penalty and when this one survived a VAR review, Jorginho rescued Chelsea by scoring his second spot-kick. There was more aggression to Chelsea’s approach after a string of unfocused displays, Thiago Silva setting the tone by winning possession off Tyler Roberts with a thunderous challenge early on, but they would not have it all their own way. Typically adventurous, Leeds did not hesitate to attack once they had settled down. There were openings for Jack Harrison and Raphinha, who saw a bending free-kick pushed away by Édouard Mendy, and Tuchel must have been concerned at how easily the visitors played through his midfield, where the absence of N’Golo Kanté and Mateo Kovacic left Chelsea short of balance. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was a ponderous presence and Jorginho, who was playing through hip and back pain, found the pace difficult at times. Leeds had too much room and it did not come as a surprise when they went ahead in the 28th minute, Raphinha planting a penalty past Mendy after a skittish challenge from Marcos Alonso on Daniel James. Those two had previous: Alonso, who has struggled at left wing-back in the absence of the injured Ben Chilwell, had given away a penalty by fouling James when the winger was playing for Manchester United in October 2019. This time he got nowhere near the ball as James, deputising for the hamstrung Patrick Bamford up front, ran at him on the right and Chelsea were up against it once Raphinha, fooling Mendy with a stuttering run-up, had tucked away a low spot-kick. Chelsea grew even nervier after falling behind, their edginess betrayed by Reece James flying into a wild challenge on James. The wing-back easily could have been sent off, although Leeds were also fortunate when Chris Kavanagh chose not to penalise Roberts for a tackle that left Timo Werner writhing in a heap on the left touchline. Leeds were beginning to irritate their hosts. For all their territorial dominance, Chelsea were making little. The attacks were too rushed at times, with Timo Werner a blunt instrument on the left, and it was hard to see where a goal was coming from as half-time approached. With tempers rising, however, Chelsea profited by increasing the intensity of their press. After 42 minutes Alonso, desperate to make amends, won possession off Stuart Dallas. An exchange of passes with Werner took Alonso to the byline and when the Spaniard cut the ball back, Mason Mount crept in unnoticed to clip a low finish past Illan Meslier. Alonso, who had been subjected to taunts from the Leeds fans, celebrated in front of the raucous away end. Mount’s goal had shattered the tension and Chelsea could have led at the break; Kai Havertz, preferred up front to Romelu Lukaku, should have beaten Meslier after being sent through on goal. Another Chelsea goal seemed inevitable at the start of the second half. Leeds, who could have done with Kalvin Phillips’s poise in midfield, had no way out and the pressure told when Rüdiger, such a driving force for Chelsea with his runs from the back, rumbled into the area before being chopped down by Raphinha, whose comical scissor challenge was eventually penalised by VAR. Jorginho did the rest from the spot, calmly sending Meslier the wrong way, but still Chelsea could not relax. They had given away four leads in their previous two games and Leeds responded well after going behind, Raphinha’s winding runs continuing to cause problems. Leeds were bold. After 82 minutes Bielsa threw on Gelhardt. A minute later another substitute, Klich, slipped a pass through to Roberts, whose cross was turned in by Gelhardt. Tuchel responded, throwing on Lukaku. Chelsea would find the answer.",Sport/Football,Jorginho’s injury-time penalty gives Chelsea dramatic victory over Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/11/chelsea-leeds-premier-league-match-report
12/12/2021,"The milestones polished another three precious points for Liverpool – a 21st goal of the season for Mohamed Salah, the team scoring for a club record equalling 31 games in succession and taking Jürgen Klopp beyond 500 points in the Premier League – but this was an arduous battle against Aston Villa. Steven Gerrard’s new team gave his old club no quarter, it was never going to be any other way, only to fall to the second defeat of his reign courtesy of Salah’s second half penalty. Gerrard treated his first competitive appearance at Anfield in six years with a predictable minimum of fuss. There was prolonged applause to the Villa faithful after he emerged from the tunnel and a little wave of acknowledgement to the Kop before getting down to the business of frustrating his former club. Villa succeeded in that regard, absorbing pressure, working tirelessly and rarely being pulled out of shape. Klopp spent most of the first half haranguing the fourth official, Graham Scott, over what he perceived as referee Stuart Attwell’s leniency but the lack of cutting edge from his title chasers would also have been a cause of irritation.  With Divock Origi joining Roberto Firmino on the injury list and Diogo Jota nursing a knock on the bench the Liverpool manager opted to deploy Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain as a false nine with Jordan Henderson granted more licence than usual to get forward. The absence of a recognised striker told in the first half, despite the impressive efforts of Sadio Mané, with Salah on the margins of the contest and several inviting crosses going unpunished in front of Emiliano Martínez’s goal. Liverpool’s first real chance of a dominant opening spell fell to Trent Alexander-Arnold when Salah dummied another of Andy Robertson’s dangerous balls along the edge of the penalty area. His fellow full-back connected cleanly and accurately only for Matt Targett to deflect the shot wide. Alexander-Arnold returned the favour with a deep cross that Robertson turned goalwards with a diving header. Martinez saved well at his near post when almost caught out by a deflection off Matthew Cash. Oxlade-Chamberlain curled a 20-yard shot narrowly over after Mané had dispossessed Marvelous Nakamba in midfield, prompting Villa’s defensive shield to clatter into Henderson for a yellow card. Three rejected penalty appeals before half-time did little for Klopp’s mood, although none of the claims were water-tight. Mané went down when touched on the shoulder by Cash having played a sharp one-two with Salah. Robinson, having cut inside Cash at the end of an incisive Liverpool counterattack, felt he was felled by a combination of the right-back and Douglas Luiz. Seconds later he went down again when challenging for a Henderson cross with Nakamba at the back post. Robinson’s first shout was the strongest of the three but Attwell was unmoved on each occasion. Though disciplined in organisation and faultless in industry, Villa’s inability to ease the pressure on their defence must have worried Gerrard. His midfield three of John McGinn, Nakamba and Luiz were sloppy in possession, albeit in the face of a relentless Liverpool press, while Ollie Watkins was often too isolated from Ashley Young and Jacob Ramsey to threaten. When Young did break through on the left and nodded the ball beyond the advancing Alisson, Joel Matip was on hand to intercept his attempted cross to Watkins. Young, afforded the customary Anfield reception for a former Manchester United player, also blazed over from the edge of the area. Luiz squandered an opportunity to test Alisson when dragging a dangerous free-kick into the side-netting from a tight angle. Traffic flowed mainly in the direction of Martínez’s goal, however. Salah saw little of the ball in the first half but almost scored when Fabinho’s lofted ball presented him with a first chance to attack Tyrone Mings. Liverpool’s leading goalscorer cut inside the Villa captain and forced the keeper to save well at his near post. Martínez denied Liverpool again early in the second half when Virgil van Dijk rose highest at a Robertson corner and sent a thumping header towards the roof of the net. The Argentina international tipped over from close range. Liverpool pressure and penalty appeals finally told when Salah took on Mings again from the right. The Egypt international slipped into the area past the England defender, who stumbled as he tried to recover ground and clipped Salah’s left leg in the process. This time Attwell had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Salah drilled the spot-kick so accurately that Martínez did not get close to the ball as it cannoned in off the inside of his left-hand post despite diving the right way. Villa responded well with the introductions of Emiliano Buendia, Morgan Sanson and Danny Ings injecting greater menace and energy into the attack. Alisson was fortunate to escape four minutes from time when he smashed a clearance into Matip as the defender held off Ings and then, in a desperate attempt to stop the former Liverpool striker converting, just clawed the ball away before making contact with the player. But Liverpool, and Salah, roll on.",Sport/Football,Salah’s penalty downs Villa as Liverpool deny Gerrard a happy Anfield return,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/11/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
12/12/2021,"A missing children’s hospital worker is believed to have disappeared on her way home from work, police said on Saturday, as Labour MP Harriet Harman launched an appeal for information on her constituent. Petra Srncova, 32, a senior nurse assistant at Evelina London children’s hospital in Westminster, was reported missing on 3 December by a concerned colleague, and officers are intensifying their efforts to try to find her.  Srncova is believed to have left the hospital at 19.45pm on 28 November. She is thought to have been wearing a green coat and carrying a red backpack at the time, the Metropolitan police said. It is believed that Srncova withdrew money from a cashpoint, before boarding a bus towards Elephant and Castle. She is then thought then to have changed to a bus travelling southbound towards her home address in Camberwell, where she was last sighted at 20.22pm. A man has been arrested in connection with her disappearance and remains in custody, the Met added. “Petra is missing, and we want people to help the police find her,” Harman said at a press conference she held on Saturday afternoon in her constituency of Camberwell. She added: “She’s been missing for quite a few days now, she’s only 32, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents of course are desperately worried about her, and I feel we’ve all got a particular responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, here working for our national health service.” A Met spokesperson said police have approached her family in the Czech Republic and “they have not heard from her”. They added:“Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Petra’s welfare and are asking anyone who has seen her, or has information as to her whereabouts, to make contact immediately.” Det Supt Clair Kelland, from the Central South Command Unit which covers the area that Petra lives in, said: “We continue to grow increasingly worried about Petra and we are doing everything we can to try to find her. “Her disappearance is out of character and, of course, her loved ones are extremely concerned and want to know where she is. “Please think about if you’ve seen her, or maybe come into contact with her.

12/12/2021,"I ate the most delicious and original dinner of 2021 at the Black Bull in Sedbergh, Cumbria: mackerel flavoured with sudachi; cod with smoked roe and seaweed; sticky toffee pudding (of course). Not that I was exactly surprised by any of it. I knew I’d died and gone to heaven when we were served hot guinea fowl croquettes with our preprandial sidecars. Miraculous.  Tricky, but I think the dish I loved most was the buttermilk fried chicken with caviar and brown butter at Skosh in York, where I managed to bag a table twice in 12 months. How I refrained from ordering a second helping – I may mean a third – I’ll never know. The coldest dinner of the year was at Saint Jacques in St James’s, London, chosen for its terrace in those odd weeks when restaurants were still only allowed to serve outside. My fingers were as blue as the steak some red-trousered type was devouring on the next table. In 2021, I cooked quite a few good things myself, weary though I frequently was at the sight – even the thought – of my kitchen. Take it from me, then, that Felicity Cloake’s recipe for fish pie is the absolute best, though I gild the lily and throw in mussels, too (keep a bag of frozen ones from Picard on standby for this emergency). I was also cooked for, which is by far the lovelier thing. I still think of the pakoras my friend Arifa served up one evening in May, soon after we’d been released from captivity (again). These birds’ nests of deliciousness, grease and spice in perfect balance emerged from her kitchen in munificent and unceasing waves, which meant that I was also cunningly able to disguise my greed for them as politeness (possibly). I told myself: no more new cookbooks. But then I clapped eyes on Crave by Ed Smith, which arranges recipes by mood, and it called to me, what with the pervasive longing, anxiety etc. It has taken me a while to accept that while I might aspire to moods that are “fresh and fragrant”, I’m actually a “cheesy and creamy” kind of person who self-medicates with unsalted butter. In 2021, I bought no new swanky knives or any other kitchen kit. But I did take delivery of my mother’s Wedgwood Sterling stoneware in rich chocolate brown. It’s very 1970s; I love it almost as much as she has always hated it. So stylish is it, in fact, I’m prepared to tolerate the awful sound it makes whenever it comes into contact with a knife. Whether my friends will feel the same is yet to be seen. My survivor of the year award goes to Maison Francois in Duke Street, London, which had barely opened when the first lockdown began. It gives me great pleasure – and yet it gives me no pleasure at all – to announce that, as I write, it’s impossible to bag a table. It will be 2022 before I can eat (more self-medication) those comte gougeres again. This year was the one when I found out that tinned grapefruit is really not bad, a discovery resulting from a sudden lockdown-induced desire for a hotel breakfast buffet (not that I ordinarily eat the grapefruit at a hotel breakfast buffet, tinned or not). The best edible present I received: chocolate decorated in suffragette colours and the words “courage calls to courage everywhere”, brought to me by a member of a certain WhatsApp group, all of whom were in my kitchen at the time. What fantastic women, I thought, as we ate it – and, yes, here comes the slushy bit. Nothing in this list would mean anything at all were it not for those we love (including the tinned grapefruit, with its suggestion of holidays, and strangers on unfamiliar landings). Food connects us. It’s a sacramental thing: every cook a priest, every table an altar. I’m not grateful to the pandemic for anything save for my ever-rising awareness of my great good fortune at having so many excellent (greedy, hungry, chocolate-loving) people in my life. Whatever happens next, it’s this (and a fish pie) that I’ll cling to.",Lifestyle/Food,The 10 foodie things that saw me through 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/dec/11/the-10-foodie-things-that-saw-me-through-2021
12/12/2021,"Screenshot (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsMoving Pictures (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsThe Unfiltered History Tour (Vice World News) | spotify.com The other day I appeared on a friend’s indie podcast (Lulu Le Vay’s Where Love Lives, if you want to know) to talk about non-romantic love. I spent most of my allotted chat time talking about loving the arts. And yes, I realise this puts me firmly in the category of perfumed ponce. But it’s a true love. Art – not just the visual arts, but music, books, audio, film, theatre, dance – has given me solace and inspiration and joy for as long as I can remember.  So I’m making no apologies for reviewing a trio of arts-based shows this week. First up, Radio 4’s new series Screenshot, in which the film critic Mark Kermode, of this parish, is joined by freelance critic Ellen E Jones. The show is about film, did you guess? But it’s a bit different: it isn’t a review show. Neither is it a film news show, which the recently axed Film Programme was. Instead, it’s a sort of exploration of movies, kicked off by a film that’s relevant at the time of recording. For the first episode this was West Side Story. Neither Kermode nor Jones had seen the new Spielberg version at the time of recording, but this proved less of a problem than you might imagine. They discussed the Robbins and Wise 1961 classic, and Jones talked to Rita Moreno, who stars in both the original and Spielberg’s film, as well as Joivan “Mandem on the Wall” Wade about his YouTube hit Shiro’s Story, with its similar love-across-the-divide theme. Kermode examined Romeo and Juliet movies, interviewing the always-interesting directors Abel Ferrara and Baz Luhrmann about their versions. There were a couple of forgettable “what I’ve been watching” bits from Lin-Manuel Miranda and Miriam Margolyes, but these were the only missteps. I enjoyed the show immensely: the ripples spreading from the initial stone in the water, the details, the exploratory tone. Jones and Kermode are lovely presenters: warm, clear, uncompetitive, both with excellent interview technique. Also on Radio 4, Moving Pictures returned last week. This is not about film, but paintings, specifically old masters, and is produced and presented by Cathy FitzGerald, whose programmes are always worth checking out. On Tuesday, the subject was Rubens’s The Feast of Herod, depicting a dinner where Salome shows the head of John the Baptist to Herod, and if you go to the Moving Pictures website, you can look at the painting while the show is on. Argh: what a frightening picture! Its sumptuousness and dread were reflected in FitzGerald’s choice of discordant background sounds, and in the analysis from the experts. The final line, from art expert Leah Kharibian, made me gasp in horror. Vice World News has a new 10-part podcast, The Unfiltered History Tour, which brings a fresh eye to favourite museum pieces. Remember Radio 4’s The History of the World in 100 Objects, hosted by the former British Museum director Neil MacGregor? This is the flip side. The Unfiltered History Tour wants the British Museum to return certain artefacts (“stolen goods”) to the places they originally came from. The episode I heard, which discusses what the west calls “the Easter Island heads”, and what the Rapa Nui islanders call moai – it means living faces, was touching and exceptionally interesting. The British Museum has a prized moai called Hoa Hakananai’a, taken from Rapa Nui by British explorers in 1868. We heard from islanders Sergio Mata’u Rapu and Tarita Alarcón Rapu, who are working to get Hoa Hakananai’a back. “For us, it’s not just a well-carved rock,” said Tarita. “It’s a living ancestor. Living.” After listening to the show I went back to the relevant 100 Objects episode (it’s No 70). The contrast between MacGregor’s lofty, academic approach and the emotion of Sergio and Tarita was stark. Both programmes described an annual island race: a scramble down a cliff followed by a swim to another island to find a bird’s egg, then a return with the egg intact. MacGregor called this the birdman “cult”, Tarita the birdman “ceremony”. Hoa Hakananai’a was central to the ceremony, and on his back are special carvings. Tarita says these are the “complete alphabet of Rapa Nui history… our entire language on his back”. MacGregor called the carvings “feeble, fussy, diminished”. Ugh. The islanders have an entirely sensible scheme for returning Hoa Hakananai’a to Rapa Nui, and this programme makes an excellent case. Other episodes discuss the Benin bronzes, the Rosetta stone and, of course, the Parthenon marbles. There is much non-romantic true love for them all, and it’s hard to argue that these works should not be returned to where they resonate the most.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: Screenshot; Moving Pictures; The Unfiltered History Tour,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/11/screenshot-radio-4-mark-kermode-ellen-e-jones-review-moving-pictures-rubens-feast-of-herod-vice-the-unfiltered-history-tour-easter-island
12/12/2021,"It covers three quarters of the surface of the Earth and gives our planet its distinctive blue complexion when viewed from outer space. But the source of the liquid water that sustains our seas and which has nourished life on our world for eons is a subject of major scientific debate. Some researchers argue that water in some form has been present on our world ever since it coalesced out of swirling clouds of dust and gas 4.5 billion years ago. Earth has always been provided with a reservoir, in short.  Other scientists take a different view, however. They say that in the beginning Earth was parched and waterless and our oceans only appeared much later – when ice and water rained down on our world from extraterrestrial sources. These were responsible for most of the 332,500,000 cubic miles of water that now cover our planet, it is argued. And now, a group of British scientists has provided key backing for the idea that the origins of our seas were out of this world. They have studied grains of material – found on an asteroid called 25143 Itokawa and brought back to Earth by a Japanese robot probe – and concluded these support the idea we got our oceans from outer space. “The dust we have studied provides good evidence that our oceans were created from water that came from other parts of the solar system,” said Luke Daly, of the University of Glasgow. “It suggests that at least half the water we have on Earth filtered down from interplanetary dust.” Daly and his colleagues used atom-probe tomography to study grains of dust that were returned from 25143 Itokawa. This remarkable technique allows scientists to count the atoms in a sample one by one. In this way, it was revealed that the grains brought back from the asteroid contained significant amounts of water, the scientists state in a paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy. This water was most likely created by the solar wind, a stream of particles that flows out from the Sun, added Daly. These particles would have interacted with oxygen atoms in the clouds of dust that float through the solar system to create water molecules which would have built up in the clouds over the history of the solar system. Then, as Earth orbited the Sun it would have swept through these clouds and mopped up the dust grains – and their water. In this way, water – “the driving force of all nature,” as Leonardo da Vinci once put it – would have filtered down from the skies on to our planet, it is argued. Crucially, other bodies orbiting the Sun would also have swept up these water-bearing grains. On Earth, these little fragments of silicate have long since disintegrated but on airless asteroid 25143 Itokawa, they will have lain undisturbed on its surface, probably for billions of years, until the Japanese probe Hayabusa swept up a sample and brought it back to Earth where its contents were revealed. The group, which also included Professor Martin Lee, of the University of Glasgow, stresses that they do not think all the water in our seas came from solar dust grains. An equally important supply would have been provided by ice in comets and asteroids that crashed on Earth. “In combination, solar dust and icy comets provided us with the oceans in which life evolved,” said Lee. This last point is supported by the fact that ice from comets and asteroids contain relatively high amounts of the hydrogen isotope deuterium compared with water on Earth while solar dust contains relatively low levels of deuterium. In combination, the two sources balanced each other out to provide an isotopic signature that matches that of water on Earth. And the discovery is important not just because it provides compelling evidence about the origin of water on Earth. It also suggests that other worlds in the solar system could have water, perhaps in the form of ice, on their surfaces with key implications for future space exploration and the search for life elsewhere in the galaxy. “Any sort of moon should be home to a renewable reservoir of water produced by the solar wind,” said Daly. “And that would be important for human space exploration. We need water to drink to keep our bodies going and we could also use it, by splitting water molecules into their hydrogen and oxygen components, to make rocket fuel. In the coming years, as we establish a base on the Moon, sources of water like these are likely to be invaluable. We won’t have to carry water with us when we travel across the solar system.” One deposit of ice is now believed to have formed in the Shackleton crater near the south pole of the Moon and this is the main target for Nasa’s forthcoming Artemis programme, which aims to set up a colony there and exploit its water resources. And the observation that interplanetary dust within our own solar system contains water also has implications for seeking life elsewhere in the galaxy, added Daly. “Across our galaxy, we can observe dust clouds in other star systems where planets are forming. That suggests these worlds will have a supply of water that will allow them to develop seas and oceans and then, possibly, life of some kind.”",News/Science,Out of this world: did Earth’s water come from icy comets and grains of space dust?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/11/did-earths-water-come-from-icy-comets-and-grains-of-space-dust
12/12/2021,"Ihave been puzzling over a dramatic question from a psychiatrist friend. He had been consulted about a patient who was behaving erratically, obsessed by the notion that his wife was having an affair. A colleague diagnosed “Othello syndrome”, which is apparently the recognised term for pathological erotic jealousy. My friend thinks this won’t do. Othello was not delusional: he was tricked, persuaded by Iago that a hanky was evidence of Desdemona’s infidelity. He wonders if Leontes from The Winter’s Tale, who, on a whim, accuses his wife and best friend of carrying on, might not more accurately lend his name to the condition? Or could I think of another candidate, in Shakespeare or elsewhere, to represent all-consuming but not suicidal jealousy? I consulted a trio of English graduates: they were stumped – and I am still looking. So far the best suggestion has come from a friend’s 13-year-old son. He thought Adrian Mole would fit the case nicely.  The London Review of Books has recently published a small volume of pieces by Penelope Fitzgerald, a terrific reminder of how far-reaching book reviews can be. The novelist’s unblinking brilliance spurred me to look for a small cache of postcards she sent when I was helping to edit her at the LRB (actually, she required no editing): one of them explained she was about to take part in a writing course in Yorkshire – “madness, as it’s only encouraging more writers and there are too many already”. The cache has temporarily disappeared and the only card I could lay my hands on was a thank-you message written after a party in 1981. She had arrived spectacularly early – the LRB staff were still slicing up strawberries and arranging pots of flowers at the back of the lawn, in imitation of a garden. The novelist sat for half an hour in an easy chair looking out of the window, chatting. Her card (a Maclise painting of The Eve of St Agnes) was characteristic: clearly written but mysterious – tactful? Feline? A joke? “It was a lovely party and obviously getting better and better… ” She had left before anyone else arrived. A small comfort for the Royal Court, from which last week two corporate sponsors withdrew their support following the row about antisemitic stereotyping in Al Smith’s play Rare Earth Mettle. At least Sloane Square itself is for the moment a jollier place. Usually the bleakest of traffic islands, surrounded by cabs and wealth, it will, until 23 December, feature a restaurant and bar run by the theatre, offering cocktails, currywurst – and hot-water bottles. This is the revival of an old dream. Just over 20 years ago, the architects Haworth Tompkins, commissioned to redesign the theatre, wanted to link the newly placed basement bar to the square via an underground connection next to a former ladies’ lavatory. The Cadogan Estate refused permission. Covid and the need for outside congregation have caused it to think again and now we can see what we have been denied these two decades. A vivid area rather than a desolate one, with audiences and passersby sharing a space, the theatre part of the flow of life. The Court is working on a new offer in the square for January. I hope it gets it. The Archers deserves congratulations on one of its meta-moments, I think scripted by the great Nick Warburton. The son of the recently deceased Bert Fry has turned up, talking animatedly about his obsessions – travel arrangements and stones. He is, Tony Archer complains, “the most boring man” ever. “Boring” is a startling new addition to the Ambridge lexicon. Is Tony, hardly the most vibrant villager, really the best first user?

12/12/2021,"Whatever doubts anyone might harbour about Arsenal’s standard, they continue to tick off the lesser assignments and will maintain an interest in the European spots if that trend continues. This was a patchy performance, particularly early on, but Southampton’s backline was always liable to be breached and the hosts’ extra quality deservedly told. Alexandre Lacazette, Martin Ødegaard and Gabriel ensured an ultimately comfortable afternoon; one so routine, in fact, that none of them will take the headlines. Those will doubtless be occupied by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who was dropped for a disciplinary breach and may see his status as club captain called into question. It is the kind of soap-opera episode Mikel Arteta will wish Arsenal had left behind but at least his players showed they can source firepower from elsewhere.  Arsenal are reliably a bundle of contradictions and could hardly have put in a less convincing 20 minutes before Lacazette set them off. Their collapse at Everton could not have done much for confidence and, while Aubameyang may not have started here in any case, his absence added to a sense of foreboding. They conceded possession repeatedly in the early exchanges and a vigorous Southampton had chances to capitalise. Nathan Tella shot at Aaron Ramsdale when he had options to either side after spinning past Takehiro Tomiyasu; the keeper would improve on that shortly afterwards with a one-handed parry from Adam Armstrong, who also had a shot deflected over. Southampton continued to exercise Ramsdale, who shovelled wide when James Ward-Prowse tested a skiddy surface with an optimistic free-kick. They harboured realistic hopes of a breakthrough in the 18th minute when Bukayo Saka pushed the breaking Kyle Walker-Peters a yard outside the box, earning a yellow card. This time Ward-Prowse, often lethal, curled beyond the angle of post and bar. It felt the cruellest of twists when, from the next serious action, they were picked apart. The goal was a journey from the ridiculous to the sublime, Ramsdale extricating himself from a pickle under pressure from Armando Broja before setting in train a sweeping move that broke the visitors’ press. It ended with Tomiyasu finding Saka in an inordinate amount of space on the right; Saka’s run was purposeful, his cutback precise, and Lacazette swept into the corner. Arsenal had almost rued loose passing from the back several times but, when it works, it pays off marvellously. Willy Caballero, the 40-year-old signed this week as a short-term solution to Saints’ goalkeeping crisis, had to pick the ball out of his net before making a contribution of note. Soon he would do so again and, for a second time, he was given little chance. Kieran Tierney, for his part, had three: a miscued attempt to cross first-time from beyond the far post; a second bite that was blocked by Tino Livramento; finally, a precise header into Ødegaard’s path. The Norwegian leapt between two defenders to convert his third goal in as many games, and now Arsenal could settle. They almost put things beyond doubt before half-time, Caballero saving from Saka after Ødegaard’s backheel. The tone and momentum had shifted completely by then and the injury-inflicted departure of Armstrong, who had been a handful, added to the sense Southampton’s moment had passed. The early stages of the second period were a low-fat version of the first, Southampton re-emerging with intent while failing to convert promising positions into threat. Ramsdale saved from Tella in the best of those forays but the game was drifting until, after a false alarm, Gabriel added some gloss. The centre-back’s afternoon had been eventful: booked early on, he was behind much of his team’s early sloppiness and later put hearts in mouths when ushering Tella aside in the box. Shortly before the hour he squeezed in from an angle after Caballero had missed a corner but was ruled offside; within minutes he got on the end of Gabriel Martinelli’s delivery from the other side, reaching it before the veteran keeper and nodding in one that counted. Martinelli and Saka each struck an upright as Arsenal, truly buoyant for the first time, sought to turn the screw. They would still have conceded, though, if Ramsdale had not made his best saves of the day from Nathan Redmond and Tella.

12/12/2021,"The best and the worst of racing over jumps was on stark display here on Saturday, as Coole Cody bounced back from a crashing fall two from home here last month to win the Racing Post Gold Cup. His brave, compelling victory was marred, however, by a fatal injury to the eight-year-old Dostal Phil, who was pulled up in the early stages by Aidan Coleman after an apparent dislocation of his right hind leg. Few horses attack Cheltenham’s chase course with as much relish as the frontrunning Coole Cody, who was still narrowly ahead of the eventual winner, Midnight Shadow, when he came down in the Paddy Power Gold Cup three weeks ago. Adam Wedge soon had Coole Cody in his favoured position at the head of the field, and Midnight Shadow too was again close at hand as they turned for home.

It’s hard to put into words how tough a horse he is.” Guard Your Dreams gave Nigel Twiston-Davies his fifth victory in the Grade Two International Hurdle, battling all the way to the line to hold off last year’s winner, Song For Someone. Blazing Khal was cut to 5-1 (from 8-1) by Betfair for the Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham next March after overcoming a mistake two out and a slow jump at the last to quicken four-and-a-quarter lengths clear of Gelino Bello in the card’s Grade Two novice hurdle. Earlier in the afternoon, My Drogo got off the mark over fences at the second attempt after a late mishap here last month. There were occasional moments when punters who had backed My Drogo at 2-9 might have been having second thoughts, as Harry Skelton’s mount gave himself plenty to do to clear a couple of the early obstacles. His timing and confidence visibly improved as the race went on, however, and his jumps at the final two fences were the best of the round. “I know he has made a couple of brave errors,” Dan Skelton, the winner’s trainer, said, “but the two that he didn’t get perfectly as he was a long way off them, he stays committed. “He doesn’t go long then at the last minute, change his mind to go short. If he is long, he stays long and that is very important. If he changed his mind, it would be dangerous.” My Drogo is priced at around 7-1 for the Turners Novice Chase over two-and-a-half miles at the Festival next March. “You couldn’t dare go three [miles],” Skelton said, “and I think over two, you would have to be super-aggressive.”",Sport/Sport,Coole Cody’s Racing Post Gold Cup win marred by fatal injury to Dostal Phil,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/coole-cody-racing-post-gold-cup-win-marred-by-fatal-injury-to-dostal-phil
