2/25/2022,"In the middle of an unforgiving snowstorm, a group of strangers find themselves stranded in a remote visitors’ centre, keeping warm until the weather allows them to leave. It could be the set-up for an off-Broadway play, a tight dialogue-heavy chamber piece, but in the far less lofty Disney thriller No Exit, it’s the jump-off for a schlocky sub-Agatha Christie whodunnit instead, one that lets us know who done it a little too fast.  Our unlikely detective is Darby (Havana Rose Liu), a young addict racing away from the rehab centre she just broke out of and toward the estranged mother whose brain aneurysm has sent her to the hospital. Inclement weather forces her off the road and into the aforementioned safe haven alongside four others (Dennis Haysbert, Dale Dickey, Danny Ramirez and David Rhysdahl), playing cards until the blizzard breaks. But Darby soon makes a horrifying discovery – a young girl kidnapped in the back of a van outside – and realises that one of her newfound friends is up to something sinister. Wisely bypassing cinemas and landing straight-to-stream on Hulu (internationally, it will premiere on Disney’s Star platform), No Exit plays every bit like a Netflix-adjacent TV movie, one that seems ill-fitting of the grandiose 20th Century Studios logo that precedes it. Based on a 2017 book by Taylor Adams, it’s a thinly plotted potboiler that takes familiar elements and barely reheats them, the end result failing to insist itself as a worthy proposition amid such consistently intimidating competition. There is some initial fun in watching Darby try to figure out who owns the van, a tense game of Bullshit peppered with inquisitive jabs, but it’s far too short-lived, an unease that isn’t stretched anywhere near far enough. Cards are shown too soon with a predictable reveal coming soon after, followed by a betrayal based on a dynamic far too under-developed to have any real impact and so a game of guessing evaporates into a repetitive one of survival. Performances are mostly unremarkable, with Dickey particularly underused, wasted in a role that mostly requires her to sit and look concerned. What Australian director Damien Power struggles with, along with Ant-Man and the Wasp screenwriters Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, is a confident mastering of tone, their film torn between two distinct target audiences. For the most part, No Exit plays like a sanitised YA thriller, softened for a PG-13 crowd, complete with a bumbling I-don’t-wanna-hurt-anyone henchman. But then when the frenzied third act comes crashing into view, suddenly so does some R-rated gore, a last ditch attempt to appeal to the horror crowd, most of whom would have lost interest a long time back. There’s a nifty reversal late in the day but it’s explained as an act of desperation rather than anything more nefarious and so a sharper bite is swapped out for something far more toothless, a development that’s indicative of the film at large. It’s an airport novel that’s now an airplane movie.

2/25/2022,"Magnus Carlsen has had a rough week at the $150,000 online Airthings Masters, but the world champion still overcame the effects of Covid to reach the two-day final, starting at 5pm on Friday. Free to view live commentary by England’s David Howell and Jovanka Houska is available on chess24.com. Carlsen was beaten four times in 15 games in the qualifying round, and blamed the defeats on symptoms which were similar to brain fog: “I lacked energy, which made it hard to focus, and when I tried to think I blundered.” Those who beat Carlsen included two teenagers: Russia’s Andrey Esipenko, 19, who had already scored against Carlsen at Wijk 2021, and India’s Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, 16.  The world champion kept his equilibrium, made sure of qualifying for the final eight, then eliminated Vietnam’s Le Quang Liem and Russia’s Vladislav Artemiev. By the time of Thursday’s semi-final the world No 1 was back to his normal fearsome strength, playing the first game of the match in a classical attacking style. Earlier, in the qualification rounds, Carlsen faced the Dragon Sicilian, and followed a formula advocated by Bobby Fischer: open up the h file, sac pieces if needed, expose the black king, then checkmate. Thursday coincided with the invasion of Ukraine, and apart from Carlsen the other semi-finalists were all Russian. Ian Nepomniachtchi. crushed by the Norwegian in their world title match in Dubai two months earlier, was impressively back in form, winning the qualification section with rounds to spare and then eliminating the young pretender Esipenko in his semi-final. Away from the board, Nepomniachtchi published a tweet which said: “History has seen many Black Thursdays, but today is blacker than the others.” It was signed with the hashtag #saynotowar. Previously the most politically outspoken Russian grandmaster has been the 2016 world title challenger, Sergey Karjakin, who switched allegiance from Ukraine to Russia and is well known as a Vladimir Putin sympathiser. War in Ukraine poses an immediate problem for Fide, the global chess body. The biennial 150-nation team Olympiad, which was postponed from 2020 due to Covid, is due to be staged in Moscow in July-August this year. The Fide president, Arkady Dvorkovich, used to be deputy prime minister of Russia under Dmitry Medvedev, and the Russian chess federation ias scheduled to send out formal invitations to participate as early as this weekend. Uefa can switch the Champions League final away from Moscow, but the Olympiad lasts several weeks and it seems unrealistic to find a new host at short notice. Meanwhile, some posts on the English Chess Forum are already calling for a boycott. Late on Thursday afternoon Fide issued a statement expressing “grave concern”. An extraordinary meeting of the Fide Council will review all planned Fide official chess competitions and events in Russia, and will take decisions after consulting member federations. Several players and commentators, among them Carlsen’s chief aide Peter Heine Nielsen, have called for Fide to act more decisively, move the Olympiad away from Moscow, and show unity and solidarity with Ukraine. Moscow 2022 would not be the first Olympiad to be dislocated by combat. When the second world war broke out in the middle of the 1939 event at Buenos Aires, the English team withdrew from the finals. Three of them became Bletchley codebreakers. Germany beat Poland by half a point for the gold medals after their match was declared a 2-2 draw without play. 3804 (by Dragoslav Djaja) 1 Nh6!!

2/25/2022,"The former Southampton manager Nigel Adkins infamously told reporters that the biggest room in his house was the room for improvement but the incumbent at St Mary’s, Ralph Hasenhüttl, tends to use a different analogy when it comes to analysing progress, with the club looking up and hopeful of a top-half finish for the first time in five years. “Sometimes it is a little bit easier for the young lads because the hard disk is not so full,” Hasenhüttl says. “It is a little bit empty and then you can put things on it easier. The older players need sometimes to put in a little bit more energy to change things because old habits are there. If you want to change them, it takes a lot of energy but they still never stopping trying.”  Impressive strides have been made across this Southampton team, from the teenager Tino Livramento, who is enjoying a breakthrough season, to the quiet evolution of the captain, James Ward-Prowse, via the revival of Oriol Romeu and the unlikely comeback of the goalkeeper Fraser Forster, who turns 34 next month. Romeu has been at the club for seven years but is arguably playing his best football and Forster, who made one Premier League appearance in three years before returning to the lineup at the beginning of last year, has been vital during a run of one defeat in 11 matches which has also earned an FA Cup fifth-round tie at home to West Ham. Mohamed Elyounoussi, another player whose days once appeared numbered, has impressed, too. Livramento, a £5m recruit from Chelsea, should be in the conversation for the signing of the season given the way he has excelled, and everywhere is evidence of enrichment. The on-loan Chelsea striker Armando Broja has been a gallant presence, striking up a fine partnership with Ché Adams. Kyle Walker-Peters, whose right-back berth was snatched by Livramento, has shone on the opposite flank, leading Hasenhüttl to compare the versatile right-footed defender to Philipp Lahm. Mohammed Salisu, signed from Real Valladolid two years ago, has seized his chance in the heart of defence. Hasenhüttl’s work at Southampton is more than three years old and he has developed an expressive and hungry teamwho are easy on the eye. Last weekend’s remarkably routine victory over Everton added to the sense that Hasenhüttl has developed a slick machine on modest resources. The result is the beauty of longevity rarely afforded to managers – Hasenhüttl is the top flight’s sixth-longest-serving manager – and his work is surely a triumph for coaching. There have been testing times – the chief executive, Martin Semmens, offered Hasenhüttl his unequivocal backing after the 9-0 defeat by Leicester – but trust in the Austrian and the model has proven well placed. Since Hasenhüttl assumed charge in 2018, when goal difference prevented the club from being bottom, Everton have had five managers. “You can see a lot of ‘automatism’ in our behaviours,” says Hasenhüttl. “We, as staff, have improved our knowledge about the game in possession massively. We get harder to screen, I think, because for the opponent it is not so easy now to know what is coming up. We have variable tactics. We have not only the 4-2-2-2; we are very flexible. It is never stopping. The most important thing is that you don’t think: ‘Now it goes by itself’ … It is always a big challenge, hard work to put in every week.” Semmens recently made the point about being transparent about the pathway on offer. Livramento was part of a back four against Everton that had an average age of 22. At 30, Romeu was the starting XI’s oldest outfield player. For now Ibrahima Diallo, 22, is an understudy awaiting his opportunity. “If you don’t let Tino Livramento go to Liverpool one day when they want him, then the next one doesn’t come in,” Semmens said. “We believe that we have created one of the best pathways in the league for the best young players in the country to come in and get better. That’s how we think we’re going to win games.” The recruitment led by Martyn Glover, who joined in 2019, and Matt Crocker, who arrived as director of football operations later that year, has been shrewd. Southampton absorbed the loss of the experienced Danny Ings, Jannik Vestergaard and Ryan Bertrand last summer. Romain Perraud has slotted in at left-back, Salisu at centre-back with some colossal displays and Broja has been a big hit after a slow start. “There were a few people out there who thought without Ingsy and these players that we would struggle this season and the opposite has happened,” says Hasenhüttl, though he knows they have not cracked anything – or maximised the space on the hard drive – yet. “There is still room [on] there. There are still a lot of things to learn.”",Sport/Football,Ralph Hasenhüttl finds space to instil change in Southampton’s youngsters | Ben Fisher,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/ralph-hasenhuttl-finds-space-to-instil-change-in-southamptons-youngsters
2/25/2022,"Ilay on my bedroom carpet looking at the blue of the ceiling, feeling like I was in a teen movie. My phone buzzed and I picked it up to respond to my crush’s last text – except this time it wasn’t a text, but a voice note, a short audio file you send via Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp. It was the first time I’d heard his voice – it was flat, low and attractive. He asked me how my day had gone. My stomach fluttered because I knew this meant he wanted to get closer to me, yet I also freaked out because there was so much pressure to get my response right. At first, I ignored the switch in communication and started typing out a message, because I hate my voice – the way I can hear my nerves prickle through my speech, the high pitch of my intonation and the number of times I say “like”. But don’t voice notes feel so much more intimate? Hearing the subtleties of the other person’s speech, as if they were whispering in your ear – and I wanted to get closer to him. So I focused on getting comfy, and pushed the record button. In response to his “How was your day?” I started telling him about the bike I had just got. “It hurts so much on your vulva. I only lasted about 10 minutes before I limped off.”  His response was awkward. “Yeah ... I can’t say much about, er, women’s engineering down there ... The seats are probably built for a male anatomy...” “Wow, say that again,” I replied in another voice note, in a mock sultry voice. He didn’t reply. I recorded another note. “I didn’t actually think you were being sexual then,” I began, a slight breathlessness hanging off each word. “I was joking cos you sounded so formal, you know?” On and on I went; it was excruciating. I should have deleted the recording but I was so panicked I forgot I could do that. I imagined him raising his eyebrows on the other end of the line. Playing my note back to his friends. Laughing at me. In a last-ditch attempt to salvage the unsalvageable, I changed the subject: “Do you like Drake’s new album?” It was clumsy, obvious, and from then on he ignored me. This recent encounter will forever remind me why I’m better off texting (like most twentysomething Gen Zs, I hate phone calls, with their awkward silences and long, drawn-out endings: “Yep, speak soon, good to chat, bye, love you, yeah bye, bye, bye …”). But, whether I use voice notes or not, among my peers they are becoming ever harder to avoid. When WhatsApp introduced them in 2013, receiving a voice note felt like a novelty – something more human in a sea of emojis and abbreviations – now, around 200 million are sent every month. Instead of a simple “I’ll meet you outside the station” text, friends now send long rambles about how they were going to catch such and such train, but then they realised the bus would drop them outside, and while they were on the bus they thought about this idea for a novel … It’s like having to sit through an unedited podcast. Twitter has introduced a voice note feature, as have dating apps Hinge, Bumble and Happn. Last month, dating website String launched with the tag line “Date with your voice”. In 2018, American singer Charlie Puth felt passionate enough about voice notes to name an album after them; and on her latest release, 30, Adele took this tribute a step further by including voice notes from her son, Angelo, in the track My Little Love. Yet for something seemingly so inoffensive, voice notes are incredibly divisive. One friend calls them “the worst thing to happen to communication since the ‘seen’ receipt on messenger”. Another, who pushes a pram, says they’re indispensable. They are beloved of younger generations, but older family members seem to find them baffling. Social media comments range from mundane observations like the Twitter user who got 142.6 likes for pointing out how often she ends a voice note with “so yeah”, to more impassioned rants on voice note etiquette. For voice note fan, model and digital editor Maddy Reid, 23, who sends 10 to 50 a day over WhatsApp, much of their appeal lies in how efficient they are to send, particularly when you’re on the move. “It’s like a phone call, except you don’t have to rely on both parties being free at the same time. Text messages don’t convey emotional nuance in the same way a voice note can, Maddy says. “If you’re broaching a sensitive topic, a lot can get lost in translation over text. That’s why if I’m cancelling a date or telling a friend something tricky, or anything else that could be misconstrued, I will almost always do it via voice note so the other person can hear how I’m actually feeling.” Reid is right to think voice is a more reliable way to express oneself than text. Silke Paulmann of Essex University’s psychology department, says: “Vocal cues alone can communicate our internal state (emotions, attitudes, motivations) without the need for additional words.” When we hear people talk, she says, any “discrepancies”, such as someone who insists they’re fine but doesn’t really sound fine, “can be picked up within a couple of milliseconds” forcing the listener to “re-evaluate” the message. So, if cancelling a date via voice note, the other person would be able to decipher from the tone whether the speaker really is busy or losing interest. Whereas with a “something’s come up” text, it is harder to work out the sender’s true feelings, especially if it includes kisses, emojis and multiple characters (“I’m soooo sorry”) to warm up the mood of the message. This is less of an issue with older generations, who tend to interpret text messages at face value. If someone replies “OK”, they assume it means they’re actually OK. Whereas a person my age (I’m 26) is more likely to think the brevity of the response means the sender is annoyed. Voice notes bypass the slightly exhausting code of texting etiquette that can make it a minefield. Of course, voice notes are not just a text substitute; increasingly people use them instead of the traditional phone call. They give you authority, says Paulmann: “In a normal conversation, you might have little control over how often you get your voice heard. The other person could talk on at you for minutes and unless you felt comfortable interrupting, you’d end up just listening. Real conversations are more fluid and prone to changes – if the other person shows no interest in what you’re saying, for example – but voice notes protect you from that.” This may explain why the majority of people who send me voice notes are women: it gives them an avenue to speak in the same way men do, without fear of being cut off or dismissed. But not everyone likes having that much power over an interaction. According to Bernie Hogan, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, it is this one-sidedness, without important social cues, that makes voice notes a challenge for some people. “During phone calls we modify our tone and the content of our conversation according to the feedback we get from the people we’re talking to,” he says. “In the absence of that feedback, we must work hard to think about the person on the other end of the phone. For some people, that comes very easily, others don’t care, but a third group get very self-conscious about having to ad-lib on the spot.” I get immensely self-conscious ad-libbing on the spot. But I still prefer phone calls to voice notes, because at least the other person can chime in with experiences that resonate with what I’m saying: I like being able to hear them mmming in a way that expresses sympathy. I feel totally at sea without these cues and begin to doubt the content of what I’m talking about. Do they want me to wrap up the story, or does it need more detail to be interesting? It’s what happened when I was sending voice notes to that guy I liked. I worry I’m making the other person listen to something that they would rather avoid. “It makes me paranoid that I’m wasting someone’s time,” agrees voice note sceptic Issey Gladston, photographer, 23. She likens the feeling of sending a voice note to making a point in a university seminar. “I just want to get out what I’m saying as quickly as possible, but then there are these other people, usually men, who go on these long tangents for five minutes which don’t have anything to do with the question because they feel they have the space to do it. I don’t feel I have the space.” There’s something quite self-indulgent about thinking people care to listen to you talking for a long time – indeed, any length of time – without interruption. You don’t know where that other person is, they might have to put earphones in to listen, and when they finally get sorted, you might just be saying: “Oh sorry, one sec, just in the shop ... yeah, Rizlas please ... the blue ones.” Voice-note devotee Reid reassures me that “it’s not about loving the sound of my own voice”, and uses the fact that she doesn’t listen back to them as proof of this. But if she doesn’t want to listen to her own notes, isn’t that proof of something else? That no one likes listening to voice notes in the first place? I normally hate the sound of my own voice, though this often changes when alcohol is involved. Recently I came back from a night out and was lying on my bed, trying and failing to persuade myself to stop scrolling on my phone and take my makeup off before I passed out. Somewhere between the prosecco haze and the inability to use my fingers properly I started sending voice notes. One to my friend about the guy at the gym who seems to treat the place like a social club; another to my mum about what I want for my birthday; then another three to people I barely speak to anymore. I told Gladston about this experience and she confessed to sending out drunken voice notes too. “The other night I sent about seven to all my friends and in the morning I unsent all the ones which hadn’t been played yet because I couldn’t bear people listening to them.” If I like sending voice notes when I’m drunk – when I’m feeling more self-assured – perhaps it’s not the voice note I have a problem with, but my own confidence in what I have to say. Either way, I need to learn to love voice notes because ever more variations of them are being developed. Hogan thinks the next big thing will be features that allow us to sound like someone else, say, Bugs Bunny or Britney Spears, “like a filter but on sound rather than image”. Reid says her main reason for using voice notes is “fostering closeness with people I don’t get to see”. With a fake voice you’d no longer hear the ripple of nerves as they talked about a job interview or the high-pitched squeal as they recalled a great date. It wouldn’t be a voice note at all, would it? In that case, I’d probably send one: clumsy flirting as told by Britney might just work.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Our love-hate relationship with voice notes,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/25/are-voice-notes-killing-the-phone-call
2/25/2022,"Australia has vowed to keep ratcheting up sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – but it has virtually zero economic leverage over Moscow. Trade figures make that clear: Australia was 94th on the list of Russia’s main export destinations before the pandemic upended the world, which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade rounded down to 0.0% of Russia’s exports.  Australia was 47th on the list of Russia’s import sources. In both directions, Russia’s most significant trading partners are China, the United States and European countries. This tends to explain why the head of Treasury advised Scott Morrison’s national security committee earlier this week that Australia could expand sanctions “with minimal impact on Australian businesses”. “Australia’s trade with Russia is essentially negligible from both countries’ point of view in a big strategic sense,” says Dr William Stoltz, from the Australian National University’s national security college. “So our sanctions have to be part of a larger global effort really to close off Russia’s economy from the world.” Australia began by imposing travel bans and targeted financial sanctions on eight members of the Russian Federation’s security council, on the basis that this group had backed the false pretext for sending troops into Ukraine. This body, chaired by Vladimir Putin, has 12 permanent members including the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. But Lavrov was not included in the sanctions that took effect early Friday morning (nor was Putin). The eight targeted members included Dmitry Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Russia’s security council and was previously president and prime minister. The second round of sanctions – which also took effect on Friday morning – targeted another 25 officials including Anton Vaino, chief of staff of Putin’s Presidential Executive Office, along with military commanders and deputy defence ministers. Four military contracting firms were also targeted. The government has also moved to curb business with a number of Russian banks and Morrison said on Friday the next targets will be more than 300 members of Russia’s parliament that rubber-stamped the invasion, along with Russian oligarchs. The names of the oligarchs targeted have not yet been released. Experts don’t believe there’s much more Australia can do in the sanctions space. “Russia has been hardening itself to economic sanctions over the past 20 years,” Stoltz says. “And it’s clearly evident from Putin’s behaviour in the last couple of days that he does not care about the economic hit that his country will take,” he says. While that might change as the US, Europe and the UK continue to raise the economic costs, he says “economic sanctions alone are not enough”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia exported $723m in goods to Russia in 2019-20, including live animals, specialised machinery and meat, according to data compiled by Dfat. In that same year, Australia imported $250m in goods from Russia, such as fertilisers ($71m) and crude petroleum ($59m). Curbing imports such as crude petroleum may have to be “on the table” for discussion, says Stoltz, but importers may also be weighing up those growing risks. “If you were a business in Australia doing business with Russia, I think on your own volition you’d be looking for other opportunities. It’s all just too uncertain.” Australian superannuation funds are also weighing up the impact of the crisis. “At UniSuper we have no direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine,” says its chief investment officer, John Pearce. “However, like every other fund we are exposed to the impacts of higher energy prices. It’s pretty clear that the invasion has contributed to a perfect storm [of higher inflation and interest rates] that had already engulfed markets.” Morrison said on Friday that Australia was playing its part alongside countries that had bigger economic stakes in Russia to “demonstrate very forcefully that we are all working together to shut Russia out as a result of their violence and their unlawful actions”. But Morrison and the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, both took aim at China after a report said it was fully opening up to Russian wheat exports, which had previously been subject to health-related restrictions. Australia is basically playing a supporting role, rather than a lead role, in the sanctions effort. “And that’s ultimately why China’s refusal [to add to the pressure] is so problematic in terms of getting a unified international response,” Stoltz says, “because you have to have no safe haven, essentially, and at the moment there’s a big one.” Additional reporting by Paul Karp",News/Australia news,Australia has virtually zero economic leverage over Moscow,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/australia-has-virtually-zero-economic-leverage-over-moscow
2/25/2022,"The Ukraine crisis has plunged Germany into an intense debate about how it will heat its homes and power its industry in future, summed up in the short question: can Europe’s largest economy function without Vladimir Putin’s gas? The Green federal economics minister, Robert Habeck, answered with a decisive “yes it can”, a day after the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was meant to deliver from Russia as much as 70% of Germany’s gas requirements. There are considerable doubts as to whether the $11bn project will ever now go ahead.  But even before Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday morning, NS2 was just a small part of the wider discussion some say Germany has been far too slow to have. At stake is nothing less than the future of German – and by extension European – energy security. Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants, leaving observers wondering how the country was planning to make its energy policy workable and future-proof. Sceptics have questioned how it made sense for Germany to make itself so dependent on Russian gas when it should be distancing itself from Putin’s autocratic machinery. Until recently, the answer from the top of government was that this was an economic project, not a political one. The robotically repeated mantra now sounds at the best naive, and at the worst, given the current turn of events, a self-defeating decision which has helped fund Putin’s war. Habeck admitted “we face turbulent days ahead”, as he promised on Wednesday that the government would provide relief where necessary to compensate for the expected rise in gas prices. One of the government’s main predicaments is whether it can deliver on its promise to make a switch to renewable energy sources in order to reach its climate goal to become carbon neutral by 2045. Gas is seen as the vital bridge in that endeavour, which, while seen as ambitious by international standards, is viewed by many climate experts as barely adequate. Importing liquified natural gas (LNG) has been viewed as one option as part of a diversification strategy. However, this has been beset by numerous problems – not least the lack of a terminal in Germany necessary to handle LNG imports. Neither would available LNG supplies be able to fully replace Russian gas and it is also an expensive alternative. Gas already comes from Norway, but those supplies cannot be increased as it is already producing to capacity. Leonhard Birnbaum, the CEO of Germany’s biggest gas and electricity provider E.ON, said that while energy supplies for this winter were secure, next year could be more of a challenge. “If Russian gas imports were to break down completely, the immediate effect wouldn’t be so dramatic as we’re almost at the end of the heating season. But next winter it could be the case that we’re not able to meet the supply demands of all the industrial customers. Some of them may have to turn off the power. It is utopian to believe that Russian gas can be completely replaced from one day to the next by other sources,” he told Die Zeit. Other critics have said Germany only has itself to blame, having dillydallied on its much vaunted plans to switch from fossil fuels to renewables. A positive headline to emerge from the recent heavy storms which hit much of northern Europe, was the record amount of energy fed into the grid by its wind turbines on Sunday. But it also served to underline how slow the development of renewables has been. Beyond Germany’s borders the short-term answer is thought to be simple: why not reverse the decisions, or at least prolong the use of coal-fired power plants and temporarily restart the nuclear reactors? But these options are seen as politically suicidal in Berlin – in particular the reactivation of nuclear plants (as well as being highly impractical and disastrous from a legal point of view). Opposition to nuclear was the founding principal of the Green party – two of whose former leaders, Habeck and the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, are now in government. Both have always opposed the pipeline. There is no evidence of ordinary Germans panicking, although heating installation companies say there has been a considerable increase in inquiries about heat pumps from people keen to find an alternative to the gas central heating. “In the short term it won’t be easy to move away from natural gas,” Hans-Martin Henning, the head of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, told Tagesspiegel. “But in the medium term this must be part of the concept of speeding up the energy source switch in the heat sector and wherever possible electrical heat pumps should be used as a way of becoming more independent from natural gas.” Andreas Löschel, an energy economist, told the same newspaper that even before the Ukraine crisis, Russia had destroyed its own narrative about being a reliable provider of cheap gas. “The trust is no longer there,” he said. “Russia has shot itself in the foot”. Just days ago at a press briefing with Scholz in Moscow, Putin heaped praise on Scholz’s fellow Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor turned lobbyist for Gazprom, saying he was responsible for brokering generous fuel rates. It was one of Schröder’s final acts in office in 2005 to sign the NS2 deal before he was appointed chairman of the company behind it. On Thursday calls were growing for the government to remove Schröder’s privileges as a former chancellor, including an office and staff, amid reports they cost the taxpayer more than €400,000 (£344,244) a year, on top of his considerable earnings from lobbying for companies including Rosneft and Gazprom. An online petition said a “former chancellor who is financed by autocrats, and makes himself dependent on them, in so doing ridiculing German interests, should no longer be financed by the German taxpayer”. Some politicians called for him to be added to the list of individuals facing sanctions. Writing on the LinkedIn platform, Schröder said although “many mistakes” had “been made on both sides” in the relationship between the west and Russia, Russia’s “security interests did not justify its intervention by military means”. He called on the Russian government to “end the suffering of the people in Ukraine as soon as possible”. He also warned against “cutting the remaining political, economic and societal connections” between Europe and Russia.",News/World news,Can Germany function without Vladimir Putin’s gas?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/can-germany-function-without-vladimir-putins-gas

No one in their apartment is sleeping. They pacify their toddler with cartoons and constantly check the news. Every now and then, the bomb siren interrupts their shock and they run to the basement, hoping it won’t be their building. Sarana is worried she’ll never see her father again. At 5am Ukrainian time on Thursday, Oleksii – along with most of the country – woke to news they were being invaded. Within minutes of Russian president Vladamir Putin’s televised address announcing a “special military operation”, they started dropping bombs near major Ukrainian cities. The Ukraine government announced the country was in the midst of “a full-scale invasion” and declared martial law. Oleksii had left Sydney for his home city Sievierodonetsk just a week ago – and like many he didn’t think a real war, a full invasion, was possible. “I told him don’t go, but he said ‘don’t worry, we’ll be fine, nothing will happen’,” Sarana said. Oleksii’s mother had died of Covid and he wanted to see where she had been buried. “That’s why he wanted to go,” Sarana said. “He was desperate to go back.” On the phone he is calm, describing how he can hear bombs drop, exploding buildings near him or guns going off. He has prepared his documents and has a visa to return to Australia if he has to flee – but right now getting out of the city is impossible. “They are all just sitting there waiting,” Sarana said. “Getting ready to go to the basement. Everyone is checking the news, social media and what other people are saying in different parts of Ukraine. “Obviously my dad has nowhere to go. We have relatives but they live in the same region, they are in the same situation. There’s shooting everywhere in eastern Ukraine. There’s no safe place to go.” War has returned to Europe, and for those on the doorstop, this moment has become about survival – about waiting it out, one day at a time. “Our other friends, they live in the same city, they were trying to escape,” Sarana said. “They were trying to get petrol, trying to get to friends ... in central Ukraine, but we don’t know if they succeeded. We haven’t heard.” Russian forces are now within kilometres of Kyiv. Normally, the city is vibrant, filled with street vendors, people gathering over coffee and on their way to work. Now it’s quiet. There are cars lined up on major artilleries for kilometres as people desperately try to get out. The ATMs are empty, and the city seems to have run out of fresh bread. But there is booze. “Thank god they still have alcohol,” said Rachel Lehmann Ware from her apartment in Kyiv. Lehmann Ware and her husband are from Huonville, a small town in Tasmania. For the past five years they’ve travelled the world, teaching in international schools. They came to work in Kyiv in July and instantly fell into the rhythm of the city. “You can’t get out of here. The roads are completely blocked there are literally people walking down highways with their suitcases,” Rachel said. “Dfat [Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade] have been telling us for a long time, but we could not get out because we had Covid.” At first they were reluctant to leave their community – Ukrainian families were still sending their children to school, and they needed teachers. When the situation escalated, the couple got Covid. Now they are stuck. “The [Ukrainians] are amazed we are still here,” Rachel said. “I was talking to a parent last week, she said ‘thank you so much for still being in Ukraine’. “I said ‘you are sending your child to school, if you are doing that, I will be here’. At the moment, though, shit is getting real. I don’t know what’s going to happen.” From their apartment, they hear bombs dropping. Loud explosions leave plumes of smoke rising before the horizon. Lehmann Ware admits it’s nerve-wracking talking to media. No one “knows whose going to rule this country next week” and there’s a concern that people who speak out could be punished. “The people here are so wonderful. They just want their freedom,” she said. On Thursday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, urged the estimated 1,400 Australians who remain in Ukraine to leave if they can. Some of them have been able to cross the border into Poland. Australian Pixie Shmigel moved with her boyfriend to Ukriane six months ago to immerse herself in her cultural heritage. After Putin declared war and the reports of shelling came through, the pair realised they needed to leave. At 4am she rang her mother, Nadia Mencinsky-O’Keefe, in Sydney and booked an Uber to take them across the border. “The roads were still quiet. She was on the phone to me the whole time,” she said. “We spoke about the sadness and horror – the man that was driving them would have to go back.” Mencinsky-O’Keefe’s grandparents had fled Ukraine during the second world war, on the same roads that her daughter had left just days ago. “[She] was fleeing through the border, exactly where my grandparents would have been. History is repeating itself for the Ukrainian nationals in terms of Russia’s aggression. “Post-WW2 we thought the international order would protect us all. I thought this wouldn’t happen again.” Mencinsky-O’Keefe is involved in Australia’s Ukrainian community. She said some had young family members who had signed up to join the militia; they’d written escape plans for their wives and children. “It’s frightening and distressing,” she said. “It’s difficult to believe in 2022 this is what’s happening.” She said she welcomed the sanctions, but wanted to see Australia and the international community do more. “How can Ukraine defend itself against these attacks without substantial military equipment, technical support and medical supplies? We also need humanitarian aid – Ukrainian people are innocent but they will bear terrible suffering and deprivation as a result of this aggression.”",News/World news,Dasha Sarana’s father left Sydney for Ukraine last week.

2/25/2022,"An effort is under way to isolate Vladimir Putin diplomatically by challenging Russia’s right to a permanent seat of the UN security council on the grounds that Russia took the seat from the defunct Soviet Union in 1991 without proper authorisation. Diplomats are also looking to see if there is a basis for removing Russia from the presidency of the council.  The presidency rotates monthly between the 15 members of the security council, allowing the office holder to shape its monthly agenda and to chair its meetings. The Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzias was chairing an emergency meeting of the Security Council in New York on Wednesday night as Putin announced his assault on Ukraine. Nebenzias started reading out a text sent to his phone by the Kremlin justifying the attack. He maintained the fiction that an invasion was not under way but instead a special military operation had begun in the Donbas. Most council members condemned Russia, one of the five permanent security council members, with the UN secretary general António Guterres taking the rare step of accusing Russia of being in breach of the UN charter. A draft security council motion, condemning Russia and calling for its unconditional withdrawal, is being negotiated behind the scenes in New York and will probably be debated on Friday, but Russia as a permanent member will use its veto. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, told Wednesday night’s meeting that article 4 of the UN charter says the UN is open only to peace-loving states that accept the terms of the charter. He said Russia’s actions showed it could not comply with those terms. But he also asked Guterres to distribute to the security council the legal memos written by UN legal counsel dated 19 December 1991 that the Russian Federation be permitted to join the security council as the successor to the Soviet Union. Ukraine claims the constituent republics of the USSR declared in 1991 that the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and with it should have gone the legal right of any of those entities, including Russia, to sit on the council. No decision to permit Russia to the security council was ever put to the General Assembly. The UN charter was never amended after the USSR broke up. It still references the Soviet Union, and not Russia, as one of the permanent members of the UN security council. By contrast in 1991 China’s entry into the UN was subject to a resolution. A member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the principles contained in the present charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the security council. The Russians claim its actions were taken in line with clause 51 of the charter citing self-defence. The tension between Ukraine and Russia at the Wednesday meeting boiled over at the UN when Kyslytsya at the close of the session looked at his Russian counterpart and said “there is no purgatory for war criminals”, adding “they go straight to hell, Ambassador.” Guterres in a brief televised statement on Thursday said the “Russian military operation is wrong, is against the charter and unacceptable”. He again appealed to Putin to stop the operation and bring the troops back to Russia. The Russian diplomatic delegation is working hard to maintain the protection of China, which has been reluctant to abandon Russia, and would never support a motion for expulsion. But US officials said, “Russia’s aggressive actions here carry risks for China along with everyone else. It’s not in China’s interest to endorse a devastating conflict in Europe and defy the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity it claims to hold dear.”",News/World news,Putin facing efforts to isolate him diplomatically as punishment for Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/putin-facing-efforts-isolate-diplomatically-ukraine
