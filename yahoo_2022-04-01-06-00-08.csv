4/1/2022,"By Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military has said North Korea's largest missile test yet used an older, smaller intercontinental ballistic missile, and not the massive new Hwasong-17 ICBM, in part to try to head off negative domestic reaction to a failed launch. South Korean and U.S. officials have concluded that the March 24 launch appears to have been a Hwasong-15 ICBM, a defence ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Washington has not yet publicly weighed in, with Pentagon spokesman John Kirby telling reporters on Tuesday that the test was still being analysed. North Korea fist test-fired the Hwasong-15 in Nov. 2017, before imposing a moratorium on ICBM testing that ended with last week's launch. Open-source analysts noted discrepancies in video and photos released by North Korean state media after that launch, saying shadows, weather, and other factors suggested it was from an earlier test, possibly a failed launch on March 16. “The choice of the Hwasong-15, which is more reliable with the successful test in 2017, could be intended to block rumours and ensure regime stability by delivering a message of success within the shortest time possible, after residents of Pyongyang witnessed the failure of the March 16 liftoff,” the defence ministry said in a report provided to parliament and obtained by Reuters. The test could additionally have been aimed at boosting its status as a military powerhouse and improving bargaining power against South Korea, the United States and the international community, the report concluded. U.S. and South Korean officials had said that tests on Feb. 27 and March 5 involved the Hwasong-17 system, likely in preparation for a full-range launch. North Korea never acknowledged the March 16 launch or its reported failure. Debris from that failed test rained down over Pyongyang, Ha Tae-keung, a South Korean lawmaker briefed by the military told reporters on Tuesday. That failure prompted North Korea to tell a “big lie” and say the March 24 Hwasong-15 launch was a Hwasong-17 to avoid negative domestic public opinion, Ha said. Thursday's missile flew for 67.5 minutes to a range of 1,090 km (681 miles) and a maximum altitude of 6,248.5 km (3,905 miles) state media reported. Those numbers are similar to data reported by Japan and South Korea and are further and longer than the first Hwasong-15 test, which flew for 53 minutes to an altitude of about 4,475 km and range of 950 km. Thursday's missile's characteristics, such as ascending acceleration, combustion, and stage separation times were similar to those of Hwasong-15 even thought the flight flew farther and reached higher altitudes, the report said. South Korean officials had suggested North Korea may have modified a Hwasong-15 or launched it without a significant test payload to increase its range. Analysts say the March 16 explosion may have been caused by a problem in the engines. The ministry report noted that the Hwasong-17 requires a more sophisticated cluster of four Paektusan-class engines compared with the Hwasong-15's two, and that eight days between launches was not enough to analyse the cause of the failure. ""If March 16 was a Hwasong-17 failure and March 24 was a Hwasong-15, it obviously shows the Hwasong-17 still has teething problems,"" said Vann Van Diepen, a former U.S. government official involved in weapons of mass destruction and nonproliferation. A second successful test of the Hwasong-15 would have confirmed its reliability, but if its improved performance was only because of reduced payload, then the significance would be limited, he said.

4/1/2022,"Five fetuses were found in the home of an anti-abortion activist on Thursday after Washington, DC, police received a tip about a ""bio-hazard material"" at the home, the Metropolitan Police Department told BuzzFeed News. The grisly discovery was made after the US Department of Justice announced federal charges against Lauren Handy and eight others in a 2020 incident where they allegedly forced their way into a reproductive health clinic in DC, barricaded themselves inside, and livestreamed it all on Facebook. Police released few details of the discovery on Thursday, stating only that the fetuses were collected by the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the investigation is ongoing. A reporter for WUSA saw Handy outside the home as police were on scene and asked her what officers had found inside. ""People will freak out when they hear,"" she told him. When I asked anti-abortion activist Lauren Handy what homicide detectives pulled out of her house Wednesday, she only said, “people will freak out when they hear.” @DCPoliceDept now says it found 5 fetuses. @wusa9 04:56 PM - 31 Mar 2022 Public records show Handy has been arrested on multiple occasions on suspicion of various charges, including disorderly conduct. According to the federal indictment, Handy and eight others plotted to get inside a DC clinic that provides abortions on Oct. 22, 2020, aiming to keep patients from being treated inside. The nine defendants used force to get inside and carried tools with them to barricade themselves, including ropes and chains, in order to prevent patients from getting in, the indictment said. Handy allegedly called the clinic days in advance, giving them a false name and making an appointment for 9 a.m. that day. Before the clinic opened, Handy then walked up to a receptionist outside, according to the indictment, and gave her false name for the appointment. In the meantime, one of the other defendants was starting a Facebook event titled ""No one dies today"" to stream the incident. When the clinic doors opened, seven other defendants allegedly forced their way inside. One nurse fell and sprained her ankle while Handy and others blocked the doors, the indictment said. According to the indictment, Handy directed the other defendants on what to do. Handy is director of activism for a group called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, which said in a statement that Handy was released just hours after her arrest Wednesday. The group describes itself as a ""progressive grassroots pro-life activists."" ""We will not stop mobilizing against violence until every unjust law has been struck down,"" the group said in a Facebook post. Terrisa Bukovinac, founder of the group, declined to speak to BuzzFeed News but referred a reporter to the organization's media contact, Randall Terry, a prominent anti-abortion activist who founded Operation Rescue, a fundamentalist Christian anti-abortion group. Terry could be heard in the background passing his contact information to Bukovinac to give this reporter. When Terry answered the phone, he first spoke in an accent seemingly imitating the cartoon character ""Speedy Gonzalez"" and identified himself as ""Jose Jimenez"" before bursting into a laugh. Terry referred to the clinic where Handy was arrested in Oct. 22, 2020 as an ""abortion mill"" and said the fetuses found in Handy's home were obtained from the same clinic. The fetuses, however, were not obtained during the Oct. 22, 2020 incident, he said. ""On a different time, the babies were retrieved,"" he said. ""There's a direct connection. We're going to lay out a timeline."" Terry declined to say when the group would provide more information, or to say if the five fetuses were the only ones obtained from the clinic. Police did not answer questions about the origin of the fetuses, or if any other items were discovered in the home. In her Facebook profile, Handy has made multiple anti-abortion posts and described actions that she and others have taken. In March, for example, she claimed she and other activists had gained access to the University of Washington's fetal organ labs and freezers. Kristin Monahan, a member of Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising said nothing was taken from the freezers during the group's activities at the University of Washington.",U.S./BuzzFeed News,"Five Fetuses Were Found In The Home Of An Anti-Abortion Activist, DC Police Said",https://news.yahoo.com/five-fetuses-were-found-home-183644390.html
4/1/2022,"The US Treasury issued a special license exempting Alisher Usmanov's businesses from sanctions. The move makes it legal for the oligarch's entities to continue doing business with US companies. Officials feared that blocking his network of businesses could disrupt global trade, WSJ reported. The US Treasury made exemptions to sanctions on Alisher Usmanov, the Russian businessman described by the EU as one of Putin's ""favorite oligarchs"" whose current net worth is estimated to be around $19.6 billion. US officials feared that blocking the hundreds of businesses believed to be connected to Usmanov could wreak havoc on the global economy and supply chain, current and former Treasury employees told The Wall Street Journal. To mitigate potential repercussions, the US focused sanctions on assets personally linked to Usmanov — such as his superyacht and private jet — instead of his business entities. The Journal's report highlighted the move as an example of sanctions put in place following Russia's invasion of Ukraine that were limited to avoid outsized impact on the US economy — and the potential burden of any lawsuits filed against the Treasury. On March 3, the Treasury issued a special license ""authorizing all transactions and unblocking all property of any entity owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Usmanov,"" as long as the business itself is not sanctioned. Typically, businesses with a majority stake owned by sanctioned oligarchs have been blocked from doing business with US companies unless granted an exemption. In an email exchange dated March 1 reviewed by WSJ with the subject line ""Usmanov mitigation,"" Treasury official Lisa Palluconi detailed the plan for watering down sanctions against Usmanov, adding that ""messaging will be that we continue to look into his entities … or something like that."" An email seeking comment sent by Insider to an address believed to belong to Palluconi was not immediately returned. Palluconi did not respond to the Journal's request for comment. The Journal, citing current and former Treasury officials, also reported that the decision to limit the sanctions on Usmanov was partly influenced by a desire to avoid potential lawsuits from the oligarch, which could eat into the department's limited resources. ""Financial sanctions on Russian elites immediately cut them off from their wealth, their ability to make or receive payments, their travel, and their ability to extract revenue from their companies,"" a Treasury spokesperson told Insider. ""The United States will continue to freeze and seize assets of these elites and their proxies as they support President Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine."" Usmanov's business holdings are substantial. He controls 49% of OOO USM Holding Co., an investment group that owns iron ore supplier Metalloinvest and Udokan copper — which claims to have Russia's largest undeveloped copper deposits. The Russian telecommunications company MegaFon is also a USM subsidiary. Usmanov also purchased the Russian business newspaper Kommersant in 2006 and owns Khimki Group, a real-estate developer, per PitchBook. A USM spokesperson told the Journal that the oligarch has previously called the sanctions levied against him by the US, UK, and EU ""unfounded and unfair."" He claims his businesses have received zero support from the Russian government. You can read more on the decision-making behind the Usmanov sanctions over at The Wall Street Journal.
