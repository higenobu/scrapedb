5/7/2022,"A woman lies dying in a pool of blood at the bottom of a staircase. Her husband, a novelist, calls 911. It is 2.40am. “My wife had an accident,” says a frantic Michael Peterson. “She’s still breathing!” The operator asks: “What kind of accident?” Peterson replies: “She fell down the stairs. She’s still breathing! Please come!” This the transcript of a 911 call on 9 December 2001. It was too late to save Kathleen Peterson. She died at the couple’s mansion in Durham, North Carolina. But Michael Peterson was given little time to mourn. Investigators found walls heavily spattered with blood and believed that Kathleen’s severe injuries were difficult to reconcile with a fall. Days later Peterson, then 58, was charged with first-degree murder of his 48-year-old wife. He was convicted and spent nearly eight years in prison, only for his life sentence to be overturned amid questions about the reliability of a key witness. Now the couple’s shocking and elusive story is told in The Staircase, a new drama series starring Colin Firth and Toni Collette. Perhaps the most eager viewer will be Larry Pollard, who was the Petersons’ nextdoor neighbour and used to play in the house as a child. He never believed that Michael Peterson was guilty of killing his wife, a telecoms company executive. “I never saw one bit of trouble,” says Pollard, 74, from his neighbouring home on Cedar Street. “In fact, I thought they were a very colourful couple. She was a very sociable lady and very well-liked in the neighbourhood. “Michael was a bon vivant. People liked him because he’s humorous. He’s not very tall but he’s he’s quick-witted. He was fun to be around.” Peterson is a Vietnam war veteran whose novels The Immortal Dragon, A Time of War and A Bitter Peace are centred on the conflict. He had also been an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Durham. The Petersons visited the Pollards at their home about a month before the tragedy. Pollard recalls: “They walked away from our yard hand in hand. I didn’t see any kind of angst against each other. I hadn’t heard anything about them being that way. They were well-liked. They were entertaining people. They were somewhat the darlings of the social set at that time.” Pollard, a former lawyer and special prosecutor, finds the timing of the alleged murder implausible because, he says, Peterson’s children were about to visit and his home had just been illuminated with lavish Christmas decorations. “When all of the authorities got there that night they came in, it was two o’clock in the morning and everybody’s looking down at the body. Everybody is assuming that she has been murdered. There’s blood all over the walls. ‘Oh, gosh, there’s a pool of blood, she had to have been beaten to death.’ “They weren’t taking in any other facts, anything that might have been different. Everyone was just assuming that this was probably a domestic quarrel where he got mad and beat her to death. At that time, domestic violence was a very serious topic. This quickly became a domestic violence case. “I, on the other hand, was not so sure. It just seemed out of character, but even more than that, why was this house all lit up from one end to the other, top to bottom and floodlights everywhere? If you’re going to beat your wife to death, you would think you don’t want people watching.” Peterson went on trial in 2003. His defence argued that the couple were drinking by their swimming pool late into the night and an intoxicated Kathleen went inside by herself and fell down the stairs. The prosecution did not describe a murder weapon or offer a clear motive but grilled Peterson about the death of a family friend whose body was also found at the bottom of a staircase years earlier in Germany. It also targeted his bisexuality, suggesting that Kathleen had discovered he was leading a secret life and cheating on her. Defence lawyer David Rudolf recalls: “We had heard rumours that the police were looking for some male lover at a gym or something like that so we asked him and he told us that he was bisexual and had instances of sex with various men. Not that it was an every week thing but that had happened. “For me, it was a non-issue like, OK, so if a husband has an affair with a woman, does that make him a murderer? I didn’t see any distinction to be drawn between having that with a woman or having it with a man. “On the other hand, particularly for [prosecutor] Freda Black, it was a real moral issue that she took a lot of importance from. A lot of the people on the jury were religious and I think probably for them it was an important factor, not terribly relevant, but necessarily important in the sense that it it cast Michael in a negative light.” Peterson was found guilty of beating his wife to death and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The verdict hit Rudolf hard. He says: “I’ll never forget it. It was absolutely soul-crushing. It was beyond belief that jury came back guilty. “As I’ve said many times, it made me question whether I had been part of the same trial that everybody else had been part of. Michael put on a very brave face in public but I am told that, when he got back in in the holding area, he broke down. He just didn’t want to show it in front of his kids.” But the verdict fell apart after Duane Deaver, a blood spatter analyst of the state bureau of investigation, was fired in 2011 following an independent audit that found problems in 34 of his cases. Rudolf cited statements from jurors that they relied on Deaver’s discredited testimony, and the original trial judge, Orlando Hudson, ordered a new trial. Peterson was released from prison but Rudolf, who was now working pro bono, could see what a toll it had taken on him. “I was literally shocked. He had aged 20 years or more in those in those eight years. But he always maintained his sarcastic sense of humour. “I remember the first time I went to visit him. I felt awful and I said something like, ‘Michael, you know, I probably feel as bad about this as you do.’ He said, ‘David, you’re going home in your BMW tonight and I’m going to be here. So you don’t feel as bad as I do.’ That sums up how Michael dealt with it through gallows humour as he did throughout the trial.” Hudson declined to drop the charges, however, so in 2017 Peterson agreed to a plea deal that enabled him to maintain his innocence even as he acknowledged that prosecutors had enough evidence to convict him of manslaughter in his wife’s death. The judge sentenced Peterson to 64 to 86 months in prison and gave him credit for the 89 months he had already spent behind bars, allowing him to walk out of court a free man. Rudolf, who earlier this year published a book, American Injustice, says: “It was as though a huge boulder had been lifted off my shoulders. It was redemption. It was joy. That would have been probably the happiest, most satisfying day in court for me ever. I really experienced both extremes in this particular case.” Peterson, however, felt “bitterness” over what had been done to him, the lawyer adds, and is now living in an apartment in Durham and spending time with is family. The Staircase explores the lives of the Petersons’ children: Michael’s two sons, Todd and Clayton, with his first wife, their two adopted daughters, Margaret and Martha, and Kathleen’s daughter, Caitlin. The extraordinary twists and turns of the trial were filmed for a documentary series, also called The Staircase, that became a big “true crime” hit before a sequel series landed on Netflix. The documentary crew is played by actors in the new drama series, with Vincent Vermignon playing the director, Jean-Xavier de Lestrade. Despite all the attention, the riddle of Kathleen’s death remains unsolved, inviting new theories. Pollard, the neighbour and former lawyer, believes that her wounds were the result of an owl attack. The theory holds that Kathleen was putting up Christmas decorations that an owl could have mistaken for prey. It points to hair pulled out by the roots in Kathleen’s hands and bloody twigs and two feather fragments in her hair. Pollard says: “Owls’ talons are needle sharp. They go straight through the hair until they hit the flesh covering the skull. That is what I determined to be the wounds. If that is the cause of her death, then Michael Peterson is automatically an innocent man. They’ve gone through a trial simply because they didn’t know what it was. “The grand jury returned a bill of indictment but everybody was chasing rabbits, as far as I’m concerned. They were sitting out there and they’re saying, ‘Oh, he beat her death. Oh, he’s got a gay lover’, all this, that and the other. There was a lot of gossip. This whole episode was a colossal rush to judgment.” The Staircase is available on HBO Max in the US and Now TV in the UK",Arts/Television & radio,‘I was literally shocked’: the true story behind new TV drama The Staircase,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/07/the-staircase-true-story-hbo-max
5/7/2022,"Former US intelligence officers are advising their successors currently in office to shut up and stop boasting about their role in Ukraine’s military successes. Two stories surfaced in as many days in the American press this week, citing unnamed officials as saying that US intelligence was instrumental in the targeting of Russian generals on the battlefield and in the sinking of the Moskva flagship cruiser on the Black Sea. The initial report in the New York Times on Wednesday about the generals was partially denied by the White House, which said that while the US shares intelligence with Ukrainian forces, it was not specifically shared with the intent to kill Russian general officers. The next day, NBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post all quoted officials as saying that US intelligence had helped Ukraine hit the Moskva with anti-ship missiles last month, making it the biggest Russian ship to be sunk since world war two. As a general rule, espionage is carried out in secret, though western intelligence agencies have turned that rule on its head over the past few months by going public with what they knew about Russian preparations for invasion, and then with daily reports on the battlefield and from behind Russian lines. The new disclosures are different however, as they concern what the US espionage agencies themselves have been doing, rather than commenting on the state of the war. In both cases, the US was claiming a hand in historic humiliations for Moscow and for Vladimir Putin, triggering warnings of unintended consequences. Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official, said: “My personal view is it’s unwise. I am surprised at the extent of official confirmation of the role of US intelligence in the sinking into Moscow, and even more so the killing of the generals. “The big concern is that this sort of public confirmation of this extensive US role in the setbacks dealt to the Russians may provoke Putin into escalation in a way that he might not otherwise feel it necessary to escalate.” John Sipher, who served for 28 years in the CIA’s clandestine service, some of that time in Moscow, thought the decision to disclose details of intelligence sharing was misguided, but for different reasons. “I just think it’s disrespectful to the Ukrainians,” Sipher said. “It’s taking away from the people who are actually on the ground, who are taking advantage of the intelligence, who are collecting their own intelligence, who are fighting day and night.” However, he did not think that it significantly raised the risk of escalation between Russia and Nato. “Putin understands how the game is played. He gets intelligence to try to kill Americans if the situation is reversed, as he did in Afghanistan and other places. The Russians have spent years attacking us with cyber warfare and disinformation,” Sipher said. “So I don’t think them being upset that America is sharing intelligence is a game-changer.” European officials made clear their own intelligence agencies would not be following the US lead. “It’s stupid,” one official said. “I don’t think it is a carefully coordinated leak.” An official from another European country cast doubt on the centrality of US intelligence to the Ukrainian targeting of Russian generals, saying the main factor was the predictability of Russian officers as they followed rigid Soviet-era doctrine. The breakdown in their secure communications equipment and the top-down hierarchy of the Russian army meant the top officers had to travel to the frontlines to be sure their orders were carried out and Ukrainian snipers were waiting from them. In the case of the Moskva, US officials were at pains to emphasise that Ukraine made its own targeting decisions, and drew information from multiple sources. “We are not the only sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians. They get intelligence from other nations as well and have a pretty robust intelligence collection capability,” John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said. “They’ve been fighting this war against Russia for eight years. It’s not like they are completely blind to the way Russia organises itself and the way Russia conducts itself on the battlefield.”",News/US news,US intelligence told to keep quiet over role in Ukraine military triumphs,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/07/us-spies-ukraine-russia-military-intelligence

5/7/2022,"Whenever we visit South Africa, our daughter’s grandma, who is nicknamed Lala, makes us dikmelktert, which loosely translates from Afrikaans as “sour milk tart”. “My grandma used to make it on the farm 70 years ago,” Lala tells me, “when the lovely, creamy Jersey milk had been soured and thickened into dikmelk [thick milk]”, and it’s life-affirming to see her make it for our daughter today – a lovely, traditional dessert that’s enjoyed through the generations. It’s similar to the classic South African milk tart, but easier to make, and makes great use of short-date pasteurised milk or soured raw milk that has thickened. (If you’re using the former, consider switching the yoghurt and milk quantities around – ie, 480g yoghurt and 150ml short-date milk – to give it a more pronounced sour flavour.) Lala’s version uses coconut butter instead of butter, is made without pastry and is topped with a dusting of desiccated coconut as well as the traditional cinnamon; to make a more substantial dish, bake the custard in a pastry case, as in the classic milk tart. This is a quick, simple dessert that’s a real crowd-pleaser at family events. Grandma Lala makes hers like a traybake in an enamel or heatproof glass dish, without pastry; if you want to bake it in a tart case, I’ve also given my recipe for shortcrust pastry; use any offcuts to make my waste-not biscuits. For the pastry (optional)200g flour (spelt, for preference), plus extra for dusting100g butter2 medium eggs30ml cold waterA pinch of salt30ml milk or water For the custard1 tbsp butter or coconut butter, at room temperature100g soft brown sugar or coconut sugar2 eggs120g plain flour150g yoghurt480ml short-date whole milk1 tsp vanilla essence23cm blind-baked pastry tart case (optional)Cinnamon, to sprinkleDesiccated coconut, to sprinkle (optional) Cream the butter and sugar, then beat in the eggs. Mix in the flour, followed by the yoghurt, milk and vanilla essence. Once smooth, pour into a greased 23cm dish (or blind-baked tart case), dust liberally with cinnamon and desiccated coconut, if using, then bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 35 minutes, until set. Leave to cool, then slice and serve. The tart will keep in the fridge for up to five days. If you’re baking the custard in a pastry case, blend the flour, butter and salt in a food processor for 30 seconds, until the butter is finely mixed into the flour. Add one of the eggs and the water, and blend for 20 seconds more, or until the mix comes together into a dough; add a touch more water if necessary. Tip out on to a floured surface and knead very briefly until you have a smooth dough, then put on a plate, cover with an upturned bowl and put in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 3mm thick. Keep turning the dough and sprinkle more flour on the worktop and pin if it starts to stick. Once the pastry is large enough to fill a 23cm tart tin with an overhang, roll it on to the pin and lift into the tin. Carefully press the pastry into the corners and against the sides, then cut off all but 1cm of the overhang (this will help stop the pastry shrinking back down). Prick the surface all over with a fork, to stop the pastry puffing up while baking, then bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 20 minutes, until just cooked and light brown. Make an egg wash by beating the remaining egg with 30ml milk or water. Remove the case from the oven and brush with the egg wash – this will fill any holes made by the fork.

5/7/2022,"The final days of April saw further unbearable temperatures recorded in India and Pakistan. Temperatures peaked at 49C in Jacobabad, Pakistan on 30 April, with a high of 47.2C observed in Banda, India. The Indian Meteorological Department confirmed that average temperatures in April were the highest for northern and central parts of the country since records began over 100 years ago. Heatwaves are a common occurrence at this time of year in India and Pakistan, but scientists believe the intensity, duration and arrival time of the conditions witnessed so far this year are caused by rising global temperatures. Despite a slight respite in the extreme heat over the past few days, temperatures are set to intensify once more this weekend and into next week with maximum temperatures expected to approach 50C in parts of north-west India and Pakistan. In stark contrast to intense heat across northern India and Pakistan, tropical parts of south-east Asia have seen unusually low temperatures for the time of year. On 2 May, the Hong Kong Observatory reached 16.4C. This was the lowest May temperature recorded since 1917, and broke the previous record set in 2013. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou observed a temperature of just 13.7C on the same day, the lowest temperature ever recorded during May. On 4 May, a minimum temperature of 13.6C was also recorded in the Umphang district, Thailand. This is the lowest temperature ever recorded in May in Thailand. The cool weather was a result of a north-east monsoon and unsettled conditions, but these low temperatures won’t come as any consolation to northern India and Pakistan with dangerous temperatures expected to return over the coming days. Meanwhile, Australia has seen its first cold outbreak of the year after the seventh warmest April on record. A cold front brought a significant drop in temperature to south-eastern parts of the country on Wednesday with temperatures 4-8C below the average for parts of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania. Heavy rain and strong winds affected Tasmania on Thursday and Friday thanks to a deep area of low pressure. Referred to as an “east coast low” by meteorologists, these features occur several times a year and can bring some of the most destructive weather conditions, including heavy rain, strong winds and flash flooding.",News/Environment,"From India’s highs to Thailand’s lows, Asia’s weather is hitting extremes",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/07/asia-extreme-weather-india-pakistan-heatwave-thailand-china-cold
5/7/2022,"“They were tears of happiness at first,” says 23-year-old Oksana Balandina of her first dance with her new husband, captured on video by a nurse and now shared across the world. Six weeks ago, Oksana stood on a mine as she was returning home with her then partner, Viktor Vasyliv, also 23, after venturing out to collect some supplies for elderly neighbours on their street in Lysychansk, an east Ukrainian town on the frontline of the war with Russia. Oksana, a paediatric nurse, and mother of Diana, 5, and Illia, 7, was, according to medics, fortunate to survive the blast, but she lost both her legs and four fingers on her left hand. Since then she has had moments of utter despair, screaming out that she wants to die, says Viktor, a carpenter, as he crouches by her wheelchair. Today, however, drinking a takeaway coffee and taking in the sun outside Lviv’s municipal hospital, Oksana – quick to smile – says she feels stronger and grateful, as she dusts some tree blossom off her husband’s cheek. In part, she says, that is due to an outpouring of support from strangers around the world touched by that moment two weeks ago in the hospital ward when her husband gently lifted his bride, dressed in white, and held her tight as she buried her face in his shoulder and they swayed to tinny music playing on a laptop. Oksana posted the video on the social media site TikTok and she has since put up other short pieces of film of her trying to keep fit to music since the incident. They have been viewed many thousands of times, provoking the vital comments of support that Viktor says his wife has so treasured during these hard weeks. “The dance was a complete surprise,” she says. “We had come back to the hospital from the registry office and Natalia and Olesia [hospital volunteers] had brought a dress and a laptop for music. Natalia said, ‘What kind of wedding is that without a dance?’” “It was pure joy and happiness,” she adds of her response to Viktor picking her up. “But then the realisation came. It’s not how I wanted my first dance to be.” There have, of course, been innumerable other difficult moments, not least explaining the injuries to her children, who are staying with their grandfather in the Poltava region to the east. Oksana and Viktor, who are waiting to be taken for rehabilitation at a specialist hospital somewhere in the European Union, have not been able to see the children for weeks. But the memory of that day, and the precariousness of life in Ukraine today, is itself hard to get over, the couple say. The retelling only emphasises Oksana’s extraordinary strength. “We were coming back home and there’s a stream at the back of our garden, so we wanted to make a shortcut and took a dirt road,” says Oksana. “We knew this way very well. I was in front and my husband and friend behind, and I saw there was a missile not far from us, I turned towards Viktor, I yelled, ‘Honey, look.’ He looked at me and I just suddenly flew into the air, I heard a loud noise in my ears. I looked at my feet and they weren’t there. Just bones.” Viktor ran to her. He was breathless, caught in a panic, he says. “In my head I thought it was over for a moment,” he recalls. “Then she started to move; she yelled to me to call the ambulance. But they refused to come close because they were afraid of the mines. They said it needed to be cleared.” The couple’s friend called Oksana’s stepfather on the phone. “So we carried her with her stepdad and our friend, we carried her to the ambulance. Oksana, despite all the shock she was in, was in charge of everything. She pushed me and I went out of shock, she was the one who told me to call the ambulance. I don’t know when would I have come to my senses if she didn’t tell me. Then she helped the paramedic.” Oksana explains: “The paramedic was a young inexperienced girl – apparently she had never seen anything like this. So I helped her. I knew my veins better. I asked for oxygen but they didn’t have any. When we came to the hospital, I saw my mom. I saw her and cried ‘Mummy’, and I lost consciousness.” Oksana does recall brief snippets of the conversations of the medics working to save her life. “When we were on the way to the hospital, the paramedics were saying, ‘If only she was able to make it to the hospital.’ When we came to the hospital, the doctors were saying, ‘If only she was able to make it through the surgery.’ But when the anaesthesia wore off and I came back to my senses, I realised – that’s it. I have nothing. I was panicking, I didn’t want to live, I didn’t want my children to see me like this.” Oksana was transferred from Lysychansk to the city of Dnipro, 200 miles farther west. “The doctors did an amazing job. They helped me a lot,” Oksana says. “I realised my life was not over. I need to move on and I need to move on for the sake of my children.” Viktor adds: “She was very depressed – she yelled she didn’t want to live. But in Dnipro there were amazing rehabilitation doctors. They inspired Oksana. And then there was TikTok. She started to post some videos, got a lot of positive comments, and it helped to boost her morale.” Viktor proposed on the 27 April and they were married the next day. “I just posted these videos just for myself,” Oksana says, “I didn’t think about becoming popular – I just wanted to document the process of recovery.

Whenever she has a minute, she is trying to read comments to her videos. She smiles, she is happier.” Oksana says she is determined to rebuild her life and continue her career in medicine – in the field of rehabilitation. “And to show to the others with my own example that you can’t give up, that everything is possible and you should keep living no matter what.”",News/World news,How hospital wedding dance restored Ukraine bombing victim’s will to live,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/how-hospital-wedding-dance-restored-ukraine-bombing-victims-will-to-live
5/7/2022,"Summer is for having fun – and a shirt that brings colour, pattern and print into your wardrobe is almost guaranteed to boost the mood. Buying a shirt that is colourful and printed is not – let’s be honest – about being sensible. But pick a shirt that “speaks” to you, that makes you smile, and you will wear it on repeat, even if it’s a bit louder than your usual outfits. A design like Ahluwalia Studio’s for Paul Smith is one to bring out now and wear all summer and beyond. Renting is a good way to experience designer brands such as Versace and Casablanca that pioneered party-worthy prints. While for quirkier choices, thrifting is a no-brainer: the 1980s and 90s were particularly fine for zany printed shirts; and the 50s produced some rock’n’roll prints that were as loud as the music itself.Lauren Cochrane Abstract, £145, by Folk from endclothing.com Designer collab£325, Ahluwalia & Paul Smith, paulsmith.com Green toys print£105, by Accra-based Free The Youth collective, dailypaperclothing.com Hothouse flowers£39 a month for 3 items, thedevout.com Palm tree linenFrom £35.89 for 4 days, by Casablanca from selfridgesrental.com Medusa£75 a day, by Versace from garmentry.fashion Products available at time of publication Vintage silk£34, beyondretro.com Check mate£40, by Vans from rokit.co.uk Pierre Cardin Hawaiian£45, thrifted.com  ",Lifestyle/Fashion,A shopping guide to the best … men’s printed shirts,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/07/shopping-guide-best-mens-printed-shirts

5/7/2022,"Iam driving back from Portsmouth late at night, after the band’s last gig of the spring tour. According to my phone I am on the fastest route, despite a section of the A3 being closed somewhere up ahead. My phone pings: a faster route has become available. Without knowing what it will entail, I accept. After a few miles the road closes down from two lanes to one, after which a series of tightly ranked cones pushes all traffic on to an exit ramp – the end of the line. At the approaching roundabout all the cars ahead of me turn left, but I am directed to go straight over by my phone. This, I think, will be that faster route I’ve heard about. In fact this takes me straight back on to the A3. None of the cars behind me follows. When I merge on to the dual carriageway, I find myself utterly alone. At first this is exciting, but when I don’t see a single other car for three miles, I begin to get a bit nervous. Is it possible that I have accidentally driven on to the closed section of the A3? I might be headed for a bricked-up tunnel, or a missing bridge. An exit comes up, but I don’t take it. My phone is still saying: press ahead. The road is desolate, and possibly close to running out beneath my wheels. Will I have to smash through a barrier at the far end? How much trouble will I be in? I awake with a jolt; sunlight is streaming through the windows. “Whoa,” I say. “Do you know that you shout and twitch when you sleep?” my wife says, sitting up to look at me. “Yeah,” I say, trying to determine where the road home ended and the nightmare began. “It’s annoying,” my wife says, rolling over. “Sorry,” I say. I get up and go downstairs. After making coffee I sit and watch as the cat tries to trap a fly against the window. I have a memory of driving through dark woods and deserted car parks in search of a way home, but also of being diverted back off the A3 just south of Guildford. One seems as real as the other. The cat bats the fly to the floor, pounces on it and eats it, crunching the wings in its teeth. “Yeesh,” I say, getting up to the feed the cat. I’ve been having recurring driving nightmares since before I could drive: a five-year-old standing on the seat behind the wheel of a rolling vehicle, watching disaster unfold. As soon as the cat empties its bowl it walks over to the cupboard where the cat food is kept and sits down. “Miaow,” it says. “You just ate,” I say. “Have another fly.” “Miaow,” it says. “The cat before you could do voices,” I say. “Different accents, different names.” “Miaow,” says the cat, weakly. “He made an effort, is what I’m saying.” The cat looks at the floor. “Miaow,” it says. “It’s not about who is the better cat,” I say. “Lucky for you.” When I got older the driving nightmares were always about getting lost: an unfamiliar section of downtown where the streets folded in on themselves. Much later, after I got my licence, I used to go looking for the spot, out by the ice factory; the intersection where you turn left instead of right and everything you know disappears. The last time I was home the whole neighbourhood had vanished. The nightmare version is now the only one I remember. “Miaow,” the cat says. “Fine,” I say, getting up and feeding it again. I make another coffee. The low morning sun casts a pale light across the table, illuminating dust and crumbs. My wife comes in. “How was the gig?” she says, peering into the sink. “Fine,” I say. “I was amazing.” “What time did you get home?” she says. “Dunno,” I say. “Sometime after one. There was this whole mysterious section of the A3 where I thought … ” “Has this cat been fed?” she says. “Oh yes,” I say. “Miaow,” the cat says. “He’s lying,” I say. “I’ve made an appointment for the dump at 10.30,” my wife says. “The faraway dump?” I say. “Exciting.” “Yes,” she says. “But the thing is, I’ve now got a meeting at 10, so you’ll have to go by yourself.” “Oh,” I say, thinking: what could possibly go wrong?

5/7/2022,"They have a routine. Swoop into the hazel. Chhrrrrrrrrrr–chidik. Check for danger. Look left, right, left again. Alert, always alert. Up to the feeder. Flick tail, peck food, turn, peck, turn, flick, back to the bush. Whizz, whirr, flurry. Busy birds, blue tits. But today it changes. From the feeder, not back to the hazel but up to the box on the whitewashed wall near the kitchen. We installed it four years ago. It’s been a monument of neglect ever since. Too near the house, we thought. Apparently not. I monitor it. Household chores go unchored, emails unwritten. Work? Pah. This is important. She comes back, holding something in her mouth. A bit of moss – just the kind of thing you might use if you were a nest-building blue tit. Shit just got real. So now we’re condemned to six weeks of daily stress. Are they laying? Have they hatched? Will they fledge? Then what? Parenthood was never this bad. Some people have nest box cameras. They can monitor the birds’ every move, thrilling to the emergence of the hatchlings, cheering them on as they grow. Upstretched beaks begging for caterpillars (try not to think of the fate of the littlest chick – life is tough). Then the first exploratory wing flaps, followed by the inevitable: out into the wide world of adventure, excitement and – this is suburban London, after all – cats. No camera for us. In the box, a world of mystery. What’s going on in there? With any luck, this. The female builds the nest. It’ll take her a week or more. Then the laying – between eight and 12 eggs, one a day. Obviously that’s her job too. As is incubation – two weeks of it. You see the pattern. In the male’s defence, he might chip in by bringing food during incubation. And in the three weeks before fledging, they’re both run off their feet. One chick can eat 100 caterpillars a day, and they are demanding diners. Bring me food. Now. One day, maybe in early June, they’ll be gone. Fewer than half, on average, will survive. Good job they lay so many – a sensible evolutionary strategy. But that’s all in the future. For now, we wait. It’s the stress that kills you.

5/7/2022,"At least 22 people have been killed and a further 74 have been treated in hospital after a powerful explosion tore the façade from a hotel in the Cuban capital, sending plumes of dust into the air and leaving rubble strewn across the street in the historic centre of Havana. 🇨🇺#UltimaHora Hace unos minutos hubo una explosión muy fuerte en la Habana Vieja en el hotel Saratoga cerca del Capitolio. Ambulancias y despliegue policial en el area. pic.twitter.com/WdtsOVrFZT Speaking at the scene soon afterwards, the Cuban president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, ruled out a bomb and said the blast at the Hotel Saratoga appeared to have been caused by a gas leak. “In no case was it a bomb or an attack,” he later told Reuters as he left the capital’s Calixto Garcia hospital, where many of the injured were treated. ‘It’s just a very unfortunate accident.” The hotel was closed to tourists at the time of the explosion, but workers were inside. State TV reported search and rescue efforts were ongoing and said it was unclear whether additional victims remained trapped in the rubble. Photos published by government news media showed much of the hotel’s outer wall blown away, exposing interior rooms, with clouds of dust billowing into the sky. Roberto Enrique Calzadilla, a representative of the military-run company that operates many of the country’s hotels, said the 96-room hotel had been set to reopen in the next few days and that the workers on site were making final preparations.“The workers were ... making repairs and doing all the work to open the property and in the morning they were resupplying the gas and it seems some accident caused an explosion,” he said on state television. Police and rescue workers flocked to the scene, cordoning off areas and buildings nearby, including the Capitolio building. Windows in the surrounding streets were blown out by the force of the explosion, and two hours after the explosion, an acrid smell lingered in the air. “I was walking past when everything went white and I couldn’t see anything,” said one woman who lives just a block from the hotel. Habaneros living in the colonial part of the city are accustomed to the sudden collapse of once-elegant buildings, which are often home to dozens of families but have received little maintenance for decades. But the thunderous noise the explosion made was something different: within 15 minutes of the explosion, more than 10,000 people had congregated outside the rubble-strewn structure, taking pictures and uploading videos. Yazira de la Caridad, mother of two, told AP that the explosion shook her home a block from the hotel. “The whole building moved. I thought it was an earthquake,” she said. “I’ve still got my heart in my hand.” The disaster was yet another blow to the island’s struggling tourism industry, which the government relies on for hard currency but has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and tighter US sanctions. “It means that less tourists will come because of fear,” said Jiskli Águila, 51, who works in a furniture factory, and was watching TV two blocks away when the explosion happened. “And with the problems in the economy and the state of the country – it’s just one thing after another.” The 96-room neo-classical-style hotel was remodeled by a British company after the fall of the Soviet Union and was considered the place to go for visiting government officials and celebrities for many years. Madonna and Beyoncé have both stayed at the five-star hotel, although recently it had lost some of its shine with the opening of new hotels in Havana. The hotel had been set for a post-pandemic reopening in four days, according to its Facebook page.",News/World news,Havana explosion: 22 killed and 74 treated in hospital after hotel blast,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/havana-explosion-cuba-latest-hotel-saratoga
