5/2/2022,"On Saturday morning, James Doyle was 18 years into his career in the saddle, much of it spent riding for the Godolphin operation, and still wondering if or when his first British Classic might arrive. By Sunday evening, he had two to his name, as a brave and impeccably-judged front-running ride on Cachet, at 16-1, saw George Boughey’s filly hold on by a neck to win the 1,000 Guineas from the 33-1 outsider Prosperous Voyage, with the well-backed Tuesday just under two lengths away in third. Cachet was stepping up to a mile for the first time but Doyle showed no interest in riding her to get the trip, sending her straight into a lead that she never seemed likely to surrender. One by one, her rivals tried and failed to reel her in, and while Prosperous Voyage was making significant headway in the closing stages, the line was always going to arrive in time for the leader. Doyle was clearly emotional after Coroebus’s win in Saturday’s 2,000 Guineas, but he seems to be getting used to the experience and was more matter-of-fact about this second Classic in two days. “I really just got the chance to enjoy today,” he said. “We knew she kind of wears her heart on her sleeve and knows this track inside out, so I felt as long as we could get those cheap sectionals midway, I could be brave and let her use her stride into the Dip. “She goes through it so well that it’s almost like she eyes it up from a way out and she really let rip through it, so it was just a case of hoping she’d hang on to the line.” It was left to Boughey to look astonished by the outcome, as the 30-year-old trainer is in only his third full season with a licence. “I absolutely didn’t think I’d be here so soon, we had four horses two years ago and the highest-rated was 62,” he said. “To have a filly like her and several others is amazing and to do it for [owner] Highclere [Thoroughbreds] is amazing. They’ve got six horses with me and it’s just massive to pay them back. “The question was always going to be whether she stayed, she’s got a really big heart and she’s very straightforward. She’s a Group One winner over a mile now and she can go anywhere in the world, which is massive. The fact that she likes fast ground makes her a global filly which is huge for us and huge for her so it’s very exciting. “It sounds bizarre coming out of my mouth, I dreamt of having a winner at Bath two years ago, let alone the Guineas.” Cachet is likely to run next in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot, while Boughey also hopes to return to the Breeders’ Cup meeting in the United States in November, at which Cachet finished a close fourth in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf last season. Tuesday, who had just two runs in the book before Sunday’s race, remains favourite for the Oaks at Epsom on 3 June, a race which her full sister, Minding, won in 2016. She was not making ground on the winner as readily as Prosperous Voyage in the closing stages, however, and 3-1 makes little appeal with several major Oaks trials ahead over the next fortnight. With The Moonlight, in Godolphin blue, staked her claim for a place in the field at Epsom earlier on Sunday’s card, pulling nearly five lengths clear of her field in the Pretty Polly Stakes. “The race did fall apart a little bit,” Charlie Appleby, With The Moonlight’s trainer, said, “but Will [Buick, her jockey] said what pleased him was that when it fell apart, he had to go through the gears and she’s found all the way to the line.”",Sport/Sport,"James Doyle lands Classic double with Cachet’s victory in 1,000 Guineas",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/james-doyle-lands-classic-double-with-cachets-victory-in-1000-guineas
5/2/2022,"News that Lisa Allen-Agostini’s debut novel, The Bread the Devil Knead, has been shortlisted for this year’s Women’s prize for fiction might be a cause for celebration in her native Trinidad, but it will come as no great surprise there. This small Caribbean island, the larger of the two-island state it forms with Tobago – with a combined population of just 1.4 million – has long punched far above its weight, producing the groundbreaking historian CLR James, as well as two Nobel laureates. VS Naipaul, representing prose, was a grudging son of the island, who pointed out in his 2001 Nobel lecture that only through leaving could he learn about his own history; Derek Walcott, in the poetry corner, was an enraptured adopted son who, in his own 1992 lecture, proclaimed the island’s capital, Port of Spain, a polyglot “writer’s heaven”. Poetry and prose have continued to thrive at home and among an increasingly formidable diaspora, with Naipaul’s own extended family alone going on to produce the Quebec-based chevalier des lettres Neil Bissoondath, and Vahni Capildeo, winner of the UK’s richest poetry prize, the Forward. The latest wave of successes, however, may necessitate an overhaul of literary orthodoxy, for the simple reason that so many are by women. Allen-Agostini joins last year’s Costa prize-winner, Monique Roffey, and Amanda Smyth, whose novel Fortune is in the running for the Walter Scott prize for historical fiction. They are merely advance warning of a literary avalanche that will be coming down the slopes in the next couple of years, ranging from fiction to poetry, books for children to creative nonfiction. The precursors of Trinidad’s younger female novelists are still going strong today: writers and thinkers such as Merle Hodge, Dionne Brand and Shani Mootoo, who are celebrated across the Caribbean, but whose canonical importance to world literature has yet to be more widely recognised. In Hodge, this lineage has its own origin story. In 1970, she became the first black Caribbean woman to land an international publishing deal. Her novel Crick Crack Monkey used patois to tell the story of a young girl uprooted from rural to urban life, beginning a tradition of historical reclamation by and for women that plays out today in the work of writers such as Roffey and Allen-Agostini. The reasons for this startling success are various. Patronage has played its part. The traces of a lively periodical, the New Voices, can be seen in writers such as Jennifer Rahim – a polymath with a new novel due out next year – whom it nurtured through two decades until its closure in 1993. The OCM Bocas literary prize has, since 2011, been first to spot a raft of local talent, including Roffey and this year’s winner, Celeste Mohammed. It is part of a small but influential festival, which has become a fixture for academics across the scattered campuses of the University of the West Indies and beyond. Then there is simple geography, which has made Trinidad such a melting pot of cultures and languages. The new literature does not ignore the violence and injustice that are the legacy of the region’s brutal colonial history, while luxuriating in the beauty and variety that have kept its writers loyal even as they spread around the globe. As Rahim wrote of her relationship with her homeland: “We leave to find / what is left behind / and that holds us, / more than we know.”",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Trinidad writers: women take the lead | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/01/the-guardian-view-on-trinidad-writers-women-take-the-lead
5/2/2022,"Ronnie O’Sullivan opened up a 5-3 lead against Judd Trump following an enthralling opening session of the World Snooker Championship final, which culminated in O’Sullivan becoming embroiled in an angry exchange with the Belgian referee, Olivier Marteel, in the final frame of the afternoon in Sheffield. O’Sullivan had won five of the first six frames to take a commanding lead over Trump, before the 32-year-old won the final two frames of the afternoon to narrow the deficit before the evening session on Sunday. However, in that final frame, O’Sullivan and Marteel confronted each other after Marteel appeared to reprimand O’Sullivan as he returned to his seat after failing to escape a snooker on the yellow. The six-time world champion, who is bidding to equal Stephen Hendry’s modern era record of seven Crucible titles, insisted Marteel was in the wrong about the accusations and he had ‘“seen nothing”, before sternly pointing his finger at the Belgian as he returned to the table to officiate. Trump, much like the rest of the Crucible, was a bemused spectator, before he questioned why Marteel had not waited until after the session had concluded to speak with O’Sullivan. However, the 32-year-old held his nerve and cleared the remaining colours to reduce O’Sullivan’s lead to two frames heading into the evening session, though O’Sullivan did not offer the customary handshake to Marteel at the end of the session. The World Snooker Tour confirmed the incident in a statement which read: “Ronnie O’Sullivan received a formal warning from the referee following a gesture he made in the eighth frame.” O’Sullivan denied any offence in an interview with Eurosport, saying: “I just think he [Marteel] seems to be looking for trouble. I just get that vibe from the guy. They’ve got hundreds of cameras out there and they can go and check them all. I’m not going to have any of it because I think he’s just trying to create something. He needs to deal with it, not me.” The first-session scoreline was one Trump will have been satisfied with after falling 5-1 behind. He had called his meeting with O’Sullivan a “dream” final but at one stage it looked to be turning into somewhat of a nightmare for the Bristolian. After Trump won the opening frame, O’Sullivan then won five in a row to move into a commanding position in the race to 18 to be crowned world champion and earn the £500,000 winner’s cheque. Falling six, or even five, frames behind against arguably the greatest frontrunner snooker has ever seen would have represented a huge mountain for Trump to climb, even with three sessions still to play. Trump had earlier squandered the chance to make it 2-2 after missing a fairly routine red, allowing O’Sullivan to provide a counter-clearance and take a 3-1 lead. He returned from the mid-session interval to win two more frames, including a second century of the session, to move into a strong position, with Trump’s task turning to one of damage limitation to ensure he remained in the fight for his second world crown. But a break of 97 in the seventh frame, followed by that nervy and controversial final frame of the session, left it finely poised heading into Sunday evening.",Sport/Sport,Ronnie O’Sullivan rows with referee as Judd Trump makes up ground in final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/ronnie-osullivan-judd-trump-world-snooker-championship-final
5/2/2022,"Months before thousands of people were left homeless because of unprecedented flooding, rental prices in NSW’s Northern Rivers were surging, largely driven by a pandemic-induced influx of families and young professionals from Sydney and Melbourne. Anna Glanzen, 40, lives in Mullumbimby. I’ve been living in this area for six-and-a-half years; I’m originally from Sweden and came to Australia 20 years ago. I’m a bush school mentor for kids and for many years I ran my own business. I earned enough to get by and loved it. I’ve since chosen to homeschool my eight-year-old son and work one day a week in Brunswick Heads. We have our close community of friends and other homeschoolers nearby and my son’s father lives within an hour’s drive. Until four weeks ago, we were living on a lemon myrtle farm near Lismore. We were given seven weeks’ notice to leave because the owners decided to sell – and then the floods hit, making finding a home near impossible. Before that, we were in a granny flat in Pearces Creek, where we were for 18 months. They didn’t want to rent any more due to fears of Covid. I’m so sad for everyone who lost everything they own in the floods. I have been in friends’ homes cleaning up the aftermath with them; I’ve seen the devastation. My son and I didn’t lose our stuff – the water stopped below our hill – but it makes me feel guilty, trying to find a home when others have nothing. Our belongings are now in storage, but others have to start completely over. My heart aches knowing this. There’s so much grief and so many tears have been shed. Every time we move into a new house, my son asks, “Do we get to stay in this forever, or is this just for a short time?” And I have to say, “I just don’t know.” We need something of our own. And we have a cat, so pets need to be allowed – I promised my son that we would never leave our cat with someone else. My budget, $350 a week, is really pushing it, but could work if I live close to Brunswick and save on petrol. I have been looking for a home for more than six months. It feels like there are a lot of people who have been escaping the towns and who are trying to move up here. All the prices for those who are already established here have gone up. People would rather take a tenant with lots of money than a single parent. So many mums and dads I know have nowhere to go – how can you take $450-500 out of your budget for rent if your income [from Centrelink support] is $1,000 a fortnight? And then pay for food and petrol? It just doesn’t work. People are getting ridiculous about what they are renting out. My budget’s always been tight but what I can afford has definitely changed. In the last couple of years it’s gone from being possible to impossible. You turn up to viewings and there are 50 people there. You wait your turn to see a tiny place that is dark and smelly. The demand is such that landlords can get away with it. The flood means there are no rentals around. Even friends with bigger budgets can’t find anything and prices have actually gone up since the floods. I saw a three-bedroom home in Lismore advertised for $1,300 a week. I looked at a granny flat in South Golden Beach that was $400 a week for a tiny little place with an unplumbed kitchen. The bathroom sink doubled as the kitchen sink. In Lismore, one landlord wanted $360 a week for a dark granny flat at the back of a block, without a yard. It smelled like rotten fish. How bad was it when it hadn’t been spruced up for a viewing? And it still had a queue of people standing out the front. Sadly, I think it was completely flooded. There was a great place in South Golden, but it was $450 and I couldn’t bring a cat. It had a mini kitchen and it was fresh, with a little patio out the front and one bedroom. There was also a great little container home on shared land in Wooyung for $350, but, same again – I couldn’t bring a cat. Through friends, I have found a small plot of land to rent in Mullumbimby and have been gifted a camper trailer for six months. A very kind property owner is charging me a minimal amount each week. There’s no electricity and no water, so we’ll be living off-grid. I am building an outdoor shower and toilet and the camper is luckily quite big, with a kitchen and a bedroom. There’s even space for a sofa, which is amazing because my son loves curling up and reading a book. I’m so grateful and relieved. This has potential. My plan is to save and build my own tiny home on wheels, so that we can drive away from any more floods. It’s OK to rough it for a while if it means I am building towards something that is ours. That’s the dream: knowing that our home can’t be taken away from us. Have you had a bad experience with the rental market? Tell us using the form below.

5/2/2022,"“Dental deserts” are emerging across England after more than 2,000 dentists quit the NHS last year, leaving millions of people struggling to get checkups or have toothaches fixed, a new report reveals. The exodus is exacerbating a crisis that has seen patients battle to get dental treatment because so few dental surgeries will see them as NHS patients. The number of dentists providing NHS care in England fell from 23,733 at the end of 2020 to 21,544 at the end of January this year, according to the latest NHS figures, which have been obtained by the Association of Dental Groups (ADG) under freedom of information laws. Given that dentists each have a caseload of about 2,000 patients, the depletion of the workforce has left an estimated 4m people without access to NHS care. The NHS now has the smallest number of dentists it has had for a decade, according to the ADG, which represents major chains of surgeries. Access to NHS dental care is now so limited that people in some areas are forced to wait three years for an appointment. The difficulty obtaining treatment is one of the public’s main sources of frustration with the health service, with just one in three people satisfied with dental services. Many are forced to go private, after seeking an NHS dentist in vain, in order to have problems resolved. Some have rung dozens of surgeries in their area in a vain quest to be accepted as an NHS patient, or had to travel outside their home area to get it. A growing number of dental surgeries do little or no NHS-funded work, citing problems with the dental contract. Covid, Brexit and government underfunding of NHS dental services have combined to create a “critical” situation which is likely to get worse before it gets better, the ADG warned. Patient groups voiced alarm at the “unacceptable” situation facing those needing dental care. “People are struggling to get the dental treatment they need when they need it. This is a hugely worrying issue. Some dental practices have either shut down or have gone fully private, with some dentists having used up their total NHS capacity and are asking people for private fees instead,” said Louise Ansari, the national director of NHS watchdog Healthwatch England. Children, disabled people and people living in care homes are the worst affected, she added. The loss of 2,000 NHS dentists last year follows a decline the previous year of 951. NHS dentistry has become “a rotten system” which lets down patients and deters practitioners of dental care, said the British Dental Association (BDA), which represents the UK’s 42,000 dentists. It blamed patients’ inability to get NHS care in England on ministers only providing enough money in the dental contract to cover the cost of treating just over half the population. “Dentists are simply not seeing a future in the NHS, with a broken contract pushing out talent every day it remains in force,” said Shawn Charlwood, the chair of the BDA’s general dental practice committee. “We need to halt an exodus that’s already in motion. Millions are going without the care they need, and quick fixes are no substitute for real reform and fair funding.” The ADG’s report says that as a result of the decline in NHS dentists “we are now seeing ‘dental deserts’ emerge across the country where there is almost no chance of ever seeing an NHS dentist for routine care. Dental deserts present a serious risk to the dental health of millions of NHS patients in England.” The trend is likely to worsen as dental practices increasingly rely on private work to stay open, it warns. The deserts are particularly concentrated in rural and coastal areas. It names the area covered by the NHS clinical commissioning group (CCG) in North Lincolnshire as the part of England with the smallest number of NHS dentists per 100,000 people – just 32. North East Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire are joint second worst, with only 37 NHS dentists for every 100,000 people. Lincolnshire and Norfolk and Waveney are next, on 38. The report also reveals that just 26.1% of adults in Thurrock in Essex have seen an NHS dentist in the previous two years – the lowest percentage in the country – followed by West Essex (27.3%) and then Kent and Medway (29.3%). Thurrock is also where the lowest proportion of children have seen an NHS dentist in the last year – just 30.7% – followed by north-east London (32.2%) and North Lincolnshire (35.3%). “Dental deserts not only stretch across the whole of the east of England, from east Yorkshire, through Lincolnshire and down to Norfolk, but are now emerging in many other ‘red wall’ constituencies that the government wishes to level up,” said the ADG’s chair, Neil Carmichael, a former Conservative MP. The ADG is also warning that the decline in access to dental checkups raises the prospect of “a looming health crisis” in which cases of mouth cancer and type 2 diabetes get missed rather than being picked up by a dentists. It wants ministers to tackle the growing shortage of NHS dentists by taking action including increasing the number of training places for dentists in the UK and extending beyond the end of this year recognition of the qualifications of EU-trained dentists. Urging reform of the dental contract Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: “Our helpline regularly takes calls from patients who cannot find an NHS dentist. We know of patients joining three-year waiting lists, just to get on the books of an NHS dentist. This is an unacceptable situation. “Dental deserts can not be allowed to develop. Dentists are often the health professional who spot serious health problems early.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We’ve given the NHS £50m to fund up to 350,000 extra dental appointments and we are growing the workforce so people can get the oral care they need – in December 2021, there were 264 more dentists registered than the previous year. “We are committed to levelling up health outcomes across the country – we have set up the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities to address the long-standing health disparities and will publish a white paper this year to ensure everyone has the chance to live longer and healthier lives, regardless of background.”",News/Society,"‘Dental deserts’ form in England as dentists quit NHS, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/dental-deserts-form-in-england-as-dentists-quit-nhs-experts-warn
5/2/2022,"At the beginning of the pandemic I moved from London to Hastings, where I grew up. My bottom teeth were hurting, so I went to the local dentist and they said that because I hadn’t had an appointment in three years they’d taken me off their list, and they didn’t have any space for new NHS patients. I checked the NHS website and looked up NHS-affiliated dental surgeries around me. I checked every one in Hastings, none of which were taking patients, and then farther and farther afield, up to Eastbourne, 20 miles away. There was nothing, so I just sort of gave up. I asked to be put on waiting lists and was told by several practices that they didn’t have one. The only other option was to go private, but I didn’t have the money to do that. I’m willing to travel but I just haven’t found anywhere to register yet. I haven’t been to the dentist for six years now. I didn’t bother changing my dentist in Hastings when I was living in London, and it was a pain trying to get an appointment. My bottom teeth still hurt. It’s not debilitating, but I assume it’s something I should get looked at. I look after my teeth as well as I can, but if you don’t get them checked over for a few years, I assume problems will inevitably develop. It’s very frustrating. I called my NHS dentist to ask for an emergency appointment for a broken tooth in January, but they said they would call me back. The receptionist told me they had to speak to the dentist because I hadn’t been for two years – which was because of the pandemic. A week later I received a call, but within a couple of days of first reporting it, my tooth had flared up really badly and the whole of my face was swollen. It looked horrendous and I could barely speak or eat and drink anything. I couldn’t really open my mouth, it was so bad. I had to call 111 and get an emergency appointment with another, private dentist five miles away, who prescribed me strong antibiotics, which I took for about a week. They couldn’t look at the tooth because the area had become so infected and swollen and I couldn’t open my mouth. The medication made me feel quite rough and I was feeling bad as it was. What really frightened me was that the dentist said if the swelling gets any worse and you can’t breathe, ring 999. Once I heard back from my dentist and explained what had happened, they booked an appointment and said they would arrange for me to have the tooth out. About a month later, the tooth had finally been removed. I was just glad to get rid of it after the pain I’d suffered. But without the delay, I might have avoided the infection.",News/Society,‘My teeth still hurt’: patients unable to get on to NHS dentists’ lists,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/my-teeth-still-hurt-patients-unable-to-get-on-to-nhs-dentists-lists
5/2/2022,"It was the last trial. The last chance. After countless rebuffs and rejections, a 12-hour bus journey to Belo Horizonte for an open training session with America’s under-17 side awaited him. If he failed to make the grade then not only would he have no real future in football, but he also had no way of getting home. A one-way ticket was all Richarlison de Andrade could afford. No safety net. No second chances. Perhaps in a parallel timeline, Richarlison does not impress the America scouts that morning. Perhaps he turns an ankle and is forced to limp to the sidelines, dejected and distraught. Perhaps he hitches a lift back to his home town of Nova Venécia, just off the eastern seaboard of Brazil, and goes back to selling sweets from a cart. Perhaps like many of his hometown friends, he ends up running drugs, in prison or in the ground. And so, a minute into the second half at Goodison Park, Richarlison is on another journey. Chelsea have the ball and are working it across the defence to César Azpilicueta, just as they have done in a thousand training sessions and match situations before. Richarlison knows that his chances of winning the ball, on his own, against a Champions League-winning backline, are almost non-existent. But something deep within, some voice from a not-so-distant past, tells him he has no choice. And so he chases. Azpilicueta hesitates on the ball. That fraction of a second is all that Richarlison needs to swallow up the ground between them and throw a hopeful leg at the ball. That yard of fine-tuned pace is the difference between the ball deflecting harmlessly away towards the touchline and ricocheting back towards him, giving him a clear run on goal. As the ball hits the net and Goodison Park explodes, Richarlison picks up a billowing blue smoke canister and hurls it back into a delirious crowd. So go the margins. Might Everton still have won this game had Richarlison not conjured a goal out of his own irrepressible will? Maybe, even if they had 22% possession and barely a third of the shots. Might they still have retained their Premier League status had they not won this game? Maybe, even if a draw would have left them four points behind a rampant Burnley side. But like pretty much every challenge Everton have faced this season, you would have to bet against them. In a way this has been Everton’s predicament all season: a tyranny of low percentages, of attacks that are doomed to fizzle out and a defence that will inevitably wilt sooner or later. If you can’t keep the ball, and you can’t keep the ball out, and your main goalscoring centre-forward has been injured for much of the season, then you are relying on a lot on coincidences to go your way. And 45 minutes into this tense and occasionally tetchy game, Everton’s luck looked like it was running out. The odds were against Richarlison. But then, the odds have been against him before. And in a grim season for Everton, they have so often been forced to dip into their Brazilian forward’s inexhaustible desire, his ability to make something out of nothing. It was his 92nd-minute goal that rescued a point at home to Leicester two weeks ago. His equaliser that rescued a hopeless cause against Arsenal in December. His lightning sharpness, often in a lone forward role, that has often been the difference between Everton and total oblivion. Could it yet save them here? Certainly you could feel the galvanising effect of Richarlison’s goal on his teammates over the rest of the game. Yerry Mina was a towering presence in defence. Abdoulaye Doucouré won everything in midfield. And most notably of all Jordan Pickford had one of those games in which he temporarily leaves the mortal plane and starts pulling off outlandish, otherworldly saves in quick succession. After keeping Everton in the game, it was fitting that with 98 minutes on the clock it was Pickford who saw this one out, smothering the ball in his own area as Goodison pleaded for Kevin Friend’s whistle. The statisticians will tell you that Everton got lucky here: outplayed in terms of possession and outshot in terms of chances, ransacking a win courtesy of a lucky deflection and an inspired goalkeeping performance. The counter-argument is that the last five games of a relegation battle is no time to be worrying about percentages. One of the curiosities of this Everton squad, for all the frequent assertions that it is too good to go down, is how many of them have endured the pain of relegation before. Michael Keane with Burnley. Andros Townsend with QPR and Newcastle. Doucouré with Watford, Salomón Rondón with West Brom, Pickford with Sunderland. This is a group of players who know what it means to stare into the abyss. And perhaps nobody knows it better than Richarlison, who at full time bore not the expression of triumph or elation, but simply the look of a man on a long journey, one who has come too far to turn back now.",Sport/Football,Unflagging Richarlison and Pickford keep Everton on path to safety | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/01/unflagging-richarlison-and-pickford-keep-everton-on-path-to-safety
5/2/2022,"The positive momentum established by Emma Raducanu in recent weeks now appears to be growing steadily. In the second showdown of a budding generational rivalry, Raducanu produced her very best performance since the US Open by eviscerating her fellow 19-year-old Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-1 to reach the third round of the Madrid Open. The victory marks just the second time that Raducanu has won consecutive matches this season, which she has achieved in successive tournaments in her first professional forays on clay. “I’m definitely very happy with my performance today,” she said. “Marta’s a great opponent, we’ve played several times in the juniors and once last year. I knew it was always going to be a really tough battle so I went out there trying to be really aggressive and it definitely paid off.” Unlike in her gritty opening win, Raducanu opened her second match at ease. Her ballstriking was pristine as she punished Kostyuk’s serve, took the ball early, effortlessly changed direction and commanded the baseline with her brand of controlled aggression. Raducanu broke serve in the opening game of the match and as the contest endured she continued to effectively adapt details of her game on the clay, throwing in loopy balls and acute angles while also peppering Kostyuk with increasingly confident drop shots. While Raducanu has frequently struggled to maintain her energy and level for consecutive sets earlier this season, she imposed constant pressure on Kostyuk throughout, who flailed and took greater risks in search of a turning point. As Kostyuk’s errors consequently flowed, Raducanu completed a brilliant victory. Just a few years ago, Kostyuk was by far the best player of their age group as juniors and Raducanu was not even close, but Raducanu has forged ahead as a professional and on Sunday she demonstrated why. In the third round, Raducanu will face another Ukrainian, Anhelina Kalinina, after she upset an out of sorts Garbine Muguruza 6-3, 6-0. Earlier in the day, the 20-year-old Briton Jack Draper won his debut ATP match on clay, defeating Lorenzo Sonego of Italy 6-4, 6-3. Dan Evans also won his first round, beating Federico Delbonis 6-3, 6-4. Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, described himself as “heartbroken” over the jailing of his former coach Boris Becker on charges of hiding assets. “He’s a long-time friend, a coach for three, four years, someone I consider close in my life and has contributed a lot to my success in my career,” Djokovic said. “I was just heartbroken.”",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu hits the heights in straight-sets win over Marta Kostyuk,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/emma-raducanu-hits-the-heights-in-straight-sets-win-over-marta-kostyuk
5/2/2022,"What was billed as the biggest night in the history of women’s boxing somehow exceeded the breathless hype that preceded it. Whenever Katie Taylor was shown on the Jumbotron in the hours leading up to the main event on Saturday, the steady roar of the crowd jilted to ear-splitting volumes. Same for Amanda Serrano, only slightly louder. That crackling energy built throughout the evening, amid lusty singalongs of Wonderwall and Sweet Caroline and The Fields of Athenry, to the type of atmosphere not seen in the big room at Madison Square Garden since Félix Trinidad and Miguel Cotto. And that was before the fight itself. And what a fight it was. High-intensity combat between two top operators over 10 white-knuckle rounds before a sold-out crowd divided by their allegiances but united in full-throated, well-lubricated enthusiasm. “We were saying before that when you think of Madison Square Garden, you still talk about Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier,” Taylor said. “Now people will be talking about myself and Amanda Serrano for years and years to come. This is a history-making fight and it definitely lived up to the expectations.” Whether the unforgettable encounter was a case of catching lightning in a bottle or the dawn of a new normal for women’s boxing, no one can say. Not every fight will have the benefit of featuring the world’s two best fighters regardless of weight. But the Taylor-Serrano fight has laid down a new benchmark for what’s possible with sustained investment. “We billed this as the biggest female fight of all time,” said Matchroom’s Eddie Hearn, who promotes Taylor. “And it became one of the biggest fights in boxing today. What we witnessed was one of the greatest fights in the history of Madison Square Garden.” It was the night that women’s boxing has desperately sought and deserved for years: the first summit meeting between the consensus No 1 and No 2 on the men’s or women’s pound-for-pound list since the second fight between Manny Pacquiao and Juan Manuel Márquez in 2008. Organisers initially planned for a crowd of about 10,000, then were forced to reconfigure the seating to open the entire arena due to unanticipated demand. For Taylor, who became a celebrity after winning gold at the 2012 London Olympics and was familiar to the public before turning professional, there was a sense her career was building to this. The 35-year-old from Bray is a proper athlete: whether unifying world titles or banging in wonder goals for Ireland’s national team, you get the sense that she’d be doing this even if there wasn’t a pay cheque at the end of the day. But for Serrano, who joined the paying ranks three years before women’s boxing was added to the Olympics and failed to benefit from the mainstream visibility it afforded, there was no certainty this night would ever come. At 33, the Puerto Rican native and Brooklyn transplant captured world titles in seven different weight classes between 115lbs to 140lbs – one short of Pacquiao’s all-time mark of eight – but has been unknown to all but hardcore boxing fans for most of her career due to a lack of investment in female fighters by TV networks and promoters. Even as Ronda Rousey was lifting women’s mixed martial arts from obscure sideshow derided by the UFC president, Dana White, to headline attraction, Serrano found herself relegated to the margins of a sport where men with résumés similar to hers are routinely among the world’s highest paid athletes. During the run-up to the fight, she recalled once being paid $1,500 to defend her world title. No longer. And thanks largely to an improbable partnership with YouTuber-turned-boxer-turned-promoter Jake Paul, who has given one of boxing’s most decorated yet overlooked champions the promotional boost she’s needed to reap the first seven-figure purse of her career by signing her to his nascent promotional company and having her fight on his undercards. Women’s sports are having a moment, if you haven’t noticed. Only hours before the fight on Saturday, Lyon defeated PSG before a record crowd of 43,255 for a women’s domestic game in France, setting the stage for a Champions League final showdown against a Barcelona side that drew 91,553 to the Camp Nou last month. On Friday, a sold-out crowd turned out for the debut of Angel City FC, the groundbreaking NWSL team disrupting ownership and commercial models through purpose-driven partnerships. But ultimately, it’s down to the product. And the immediate calls for Taylor-Serrano II in the aftermath of the fight will only keep the momentum going. Both Taylor and Serrano were open to the idea of running it back in Ireland, where Taylor has yet to fight as a professional. But Hearn said that Madison Square Garden officials have already inquired about doing the rematch in New York in the fall. Let the bidding begin. “We all want to see the best versus the best,” Taylor said. “We’ve seen something special here tonight, but imagine fighting in front of 80,000 or 90,000 people at Croke Park. Absolutely that can happen.”",Sport/Sport,Taylor v Serrano delivers on the breathless hype to join boxing classics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/taylor-v-serrano-delivers-on-the-breathless-hype-to-join-boxing-classics
5/2/2022,"The “revenge” political attack on Disney by Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, for opposing his “don’t say gay” law violates the party’s mantra of restrained government, his counterpart in Arkansas said. DeSantis and Asa Hutchinson could be rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. On Sunday, Hutchinson laid out his position on CNN’s State of the Union. “I don’t believe that government should be punitive against private businesses because we disagree with them,” the Arkansas governor said, referring to the law DeSantis signed last week dissolving Disney’s 55-year right to self-government through its special taxing district in Florida. “That’s not the right approach… to me it’s the old Republican principle of having a restrained government.” Critics have criticised DeSantis for escalating his feud with the theme park giant, his state’s largest private employer, over the “don’t say gay” law, which bans classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in certain grades. Many educators believe the law is “hurtful and insulting” and threatens support for LBGTQ+ students in schools. Equality advocacy groups have filed a lawsuit against it. “They are abusing their power and trying to scare Floridians and businesses away from expressing any support for that community,” a Democratic state representative, Carlos Guillermo Smith, has said. Hutchinson appeared to have no problem with DeSantis going after the LGBTQ+ community. “The law that was passed is to me common sense that in those grades, those lower grades, you shouldn’t be teaching sexual orientation, those matters that should not be covered at that age,” he said. “[But] let’s do the right thing. It’s a fair debate about the special tax privileges, I understand that debate. But let’s not go after businesses and punish them because we disagree with what they say. “I disagree with a punitive approach to businesses. Businesses make mistakes, [Disney] shouldn’t have gone there, but we should not be punishing them for their private actions.” Disney struck back at DeSantis this week by informing investors that the state cannot dissolve its status without first paying off the company’s bond debts, reported by CNN to be about $1bn. The dispute centers on an entity called the Reedy Creek improvement district, established by Florida lawmakers in 1967 to allow Disney to raise its own taxes and provide essential government services as it began to construct its theme park empire. DeSantis’s law seeks to eliminate all special taxing districts created before 1968. Analysts predict families in two counties that Disney’s land covers could face property tax rises of thousands of dollars each if Reedy Creek is terminated next summer. DeSantis insisted during a Fox News town hall on Thursday that Disney would be responsible for paying its debts. Without providing details, he promised “additional legislative action” to fix the issue, CNN said.

5/2/2022,"My friend Dominic Hopkins, who has died suddenly aged 57, was a dedicated, popular and inspirational violinist who played for many years with the Norwich Philharmonic Orchestra and was its leader from 2008 to 2016. He also played with Academy of St Thomas, Norwich Baroque, Claxton Opera and Norwich Pops Orchestra, soloing with the latter in Vaughan Williams’s The Lark Ascending, in Norwich Cathedral in 2012. He had fond memories of playing above the waves in Cromer’s end of the pier Pavilion theatre, accompanying Cromer and Sheringham Operatic and Dramatic Society shows, including their 2014 centenary production of Oliver!. Born in Norwich to Pam (nee Balding), a teacher, and Eric Hopkins, a teacher and educational psychologist, Dom began playing violin aged eight or nine, often waking early to practise. He led the Hewett school orchestra and sang with the school choir on summer visits to Vienna. He also busked with friends, playing money-spinning popular classics. Going on to lead Norwich Students Orchestra and Norfolk County Youth Orchestra, Dom attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. However he left after a year because of performance anxieties. As a mature student, aged 27, he studied mathematics at the University of East Anglia, earning a first. He then began doing offshore surveying work, surveying the beds of the North and Black Sea for the oil industry and, from a light aircraft, surveying for diamonds in Botswana. Throughout a full life he appeared indomitable, making light of the Marfan syndrome mainly affecting his circulation, which led to more than 20 operations. Later, he experienced epileptic seizures. At one point while doing his surveying work Dom had to be airlifted from ship to hospital for an operation and was eventually invalided out in 2004 – he was offered an office role but declined. He then studied for a master’s in mathematical physics at King’s College London. As well as his performing and scientific career Dom taught physics to adults at City College, Norwich, and taught musical youngsters for Sistema in the city. Dom loved camping holidays and for more than 30 years was a regular participant at Music Camp, near High Wycombe, performing challenging repertoire with fellow musicians from far afield. I first met Dominic in his busking days, when Mozart, Pachelbel and Vivaldi filled the air, and our paths would often cross in concert hall or swimming pool. Dominic swam regularly for therapy and pleasure but, following a medical emergency while swimming, was taken to hospital, where he died the next day. He is survived by his older brothers, Tim and Chris. ",Arts/Music,Dominic Hopkins obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/01/dominic-hopkins-obituary
5/2/2022,"When Sara Gama and her Juventus Women teammates played for the first time at the club’s Allianz Stadium in Turin in March 2019, she knew the moment marked a significant leap forward in the acceptance of women’s football in Italy. More than 39,000 spectators filled the stadium, which until then had only been played in by men, breaking the previous 14,000 record for a women’s match in Italy. To top off the occasion, Juventus beat Fiorentina 1-0. “There was a lot of emotion because it was the first time we played in such a big stadium, and in front of so many people,” said Gama, a celebrated defender who captains Juventus Women and the Italy women’s team. “We were aware that we were making history … but it wasn’t the only important thing that had happened in women’s football.” Juventus Women were formed two years earlier after it became obligatory for top-flight men’s clubs to have a women’s team. In addition, the match at the Allianz came on the heels of the national side qualifying for a place in the 2019 Women’s World Cup for the first time in two decades. Now Gama and her fellow Serie A female colleagues are celebrating another epoch-making change after finally being upgraded to professional status by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). The change ends years of top-division female players earning capped salaries due to being recognised only as amateur athletes, and takes effect from 1 July, in time for the next season. Gama, 33, was among those who fought hard for the upgrade, which removes a gross salary cap of €30,000 a season and entitles the women to contracts that include social security contributions such as health insurance and pensions. The minimum wage currently agreed for a Serie A player aged between 19 and 23 is €20,263 a season, and €26,664 from age 24. However, Gama, who has become an emblem of the women’s game in Italy, is not expecting her wage to match that of her multimillion-earning male counterparts anytime soon. “This is the minimum, so obviously there are players getting more, and of course we are not at the same level as the US women’s team, which recently won an incredible fight over equal pay,” she said. “I am quite practical and look at my realities: the first thing I need is to have the same working conditions as men, as this is a job we’re doing.” Gama, who previously played for Paris Saint-Germain, said the change would help boost the credibility of Italian women’s football abroad, and would make the league more attractive to sponsors and foreign talent. “We want to be better and better and this will help the clubs to grow, so it’s win-win.” Born in Trieste to an Italian mother and a Congolese father, Gama was passionate about football from an early age, playing football with the boys in her neighbourhood. As her talent flourished, she joined a youth football team. “I was the only girl on the team,” she said. “It was normal for my teammates to see me play as we used to play together as kids, and I soon found my space on the team and had their respect. Of course, when we played matches the opponents were surprised to see a girl playing, and sceptical.” Although the Serie A women’s league has existed in some shape or form since 1968, it was only in 2017 that the requirement for men’s Serie A clubs to have a women’s team was introduced. However, ACF Fiorentina was a step ahead of the game, having established a women’s squad a few years earlier. “Fiorentina was the first company to believe in this movement,” said Daniela Sabatino, an attacker for Fiorentina’s women’s team and member of the national football team. “And so we’re really happy to finally be considered professional.” Sabatino turns 37 in June and said she will only be able to enjoy the benefits of a professional contract for a short time. Recalling a period when women had to juggle training with their paid jobs, didn’t have physiotherapists and played on inadequate pitches, she said the change would inspire and mould further generations, while hopefully earning the women’s game a higher profile in Italian media coverage. Like Gama, Sabatino, who was born in a small town in the Abruzzo region, said she has always been passionate about football. “My mother said I was born with a football,” she added. “I played it always, and dreamed of becoming professional. Although I now hope that one day women can earn as much as men.” Both women are now preparing for Italy’s participation in the Women’s Euro 2022 tournament, being held in England this summer, and for crucial World Cup 2023 qualifiers later in the year. “Our destiny is in our hands,” said Gama. “It’s important for Italy to remain on the big stage. We got there in 2019 for the first time in 20 years, and now it’s important to be there again.”",Sport/Football,‘We’re really happy’: Italy’s female footballers on new professional status,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/were-really-happy-italys-female-footballers-on-new-professional-status
