3/17/2022,"""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely stalled on all fronts,"" Britain's Ministry of Defense said in a public intelligence assessment early Thursday. ""Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea, or air in recent days and they continue to suffer heavy losses. Ukrainian resistance remains staunch and well-coordinated. The vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands."" One Ukrainian town, Voznesensk, is still in Ukraine's hands because Ukrainian soldiers and local volunteers repelled a Russian attempt to capture it, in ""one of the most comprehensive routs President Vladimir Putin's forces have suffered since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine,"" The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, based on reporting in the strategically located southern town of 35,000. ""Judging from the destroyed and abandoned armor,"" the Ukrainians ""eliminated most of a Russian battalion tactical group on March 2 and 3,"" killing an estimated 100 Russians and capturing or destroying 30 of 43 Russian tanks and other vehicles, the Journal reports. ""The Ukrainian defenders' performance against a much-better-armed enemy in an overwhelmingly Russian-speaking region was successful in part because of widespread popular support for the Ukrainian cause — one reason the Russian invasion across the country has failed to achieve its principal goals so far."" Conservatively, more than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed since Putin's Feb. 24 invasion, ""a staggering number amassed in just three weeks of fighting,"" The New York Times reports. ""Pentagon officials say a 10 percent casualty rate, including dead and wounded, for a single unit renders it unable to carry out combat-related tasks,"" and ""Russian casualties, when including the estimated 14,000 to 21,000 injured, are near that level.""

3/17/2022,"Move over “gazpacho police,” Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is back with a brand new gaffe. On Wednesday, the extremist Georgia Republican caused much mirth on Twitter when she wrote “commander and chief” instead of “commander in chief” while clashing with conservative commentator Bill Kristol. She also wrote “your” instead of “you’re.” Greene’s personal account was nixed from Twitter in January for repeated violations of the platform’s COVID misinformation policy. She continues to post on her congressional account, though. Critics predictably pounced on her latest snafu: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/17/2022,"In a tense back-and-forth where she invoked Fidel Castro and JFK, U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar sparred with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson over whether she backs a “no-fly zone” in Ukraine’s airspace, after a video clip where she appeared to support shooting down Russian planes went viral. During the 20-minute interview on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Wednesday, Salazar — a Miami Congresswoman who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee — said she wanted to clarify her position on supporting Ukraine against Russian invasion, adding that any questions about whether a “no-fly zone” would increase the U.S.’ involvement in the war were “hypothetical.” “My position is that we should not take the ‘no-fly zone’ off the table,” Salazar told Carlson. “But before that ... give [Volodymyr] Zelensky exactly what he’s asking for. No troops on the ground. Let’s give him the MiGs and S 300s, what he needs to defend his own airspace, so that he can create his own no-fly zone. And I think that’s what we should have done months ago.” Salazar was defending her position after a reporter with The Grayzone, an independent news outlet, asked her if she thought a “no-fly zone” would mean “direct conventional warfare with Russia.” “I don’t know what it will mean, but you know, freedom is not free,” Salazar said. The reporter followed up, “So you don’t know what a no fly zone would mean, if you have to shoot down Russian planes, I mean...” And Salazar responded: “Of course.” When Carlson asked Wednesday if Salazar could say how a war with Russia would then play out, Salazar rebuffed his question and said her soundbite was taken out of context. “I think that’s hypothetical question,” she said. “That was taken out of context because I said ‘of course’ that I know what that means.” To justify her position on pushing for a no-fly zone, which the Biden administration has so far not supported, Salazar referenced President John F. Kennedy’s handling of Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, adding that Russia, Iran, China, Fidel, Nicaragua and Venezuela are “watching what we’re doing.” “You say that we’re supposed to be representing the American people. I represent District 27, where you have millions of Cuban Americans and I’m representing what we think. We know that we acquire peace through strength. Look at what happened in 1960, Fidel Castro and JFK,” Salazar said before Carlson cut her off. “Stop, I’m sorry, I’m not going to take the anti-communist lecture from anybody because of course I agree with you,” he said. “By the way, I hope that you’re not speaking for, quote, ‘Cuban Americans’ but for all Americans because it’s not a racial question, it’s a question of national interest.” When Carlson pressed Salazar on whether she had considered the possibility that war with Russia posed the risk of a nuclear attack on the U.S., she said she had considered that concern but that it was a hypothetical question. “I believe that he will not take that step if starting today the Biden administration will send the message that we are in charge, that NATO is ready to confront him and so are we,” she said. “If Zelenskyy comes to the United States Congress and he says that this is the best path forward, who are we to say that [it isn’t] ... they are the ones dying on the streets.”",Politics/Miami Herald,‘I’m not going to take the anti-communist lecture’: Tucker Carlson spars with Salazar,https://news.yahoo.com/m-not-going-anti-communist-024546522.html
