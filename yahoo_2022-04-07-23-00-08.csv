4/7/2022,"A $500,000 bond is set for a Mobile, Alabama, man who police say killed another man by hitting him over the head with a shovel and pipe. Prosecutors on the case told a judge at a bond hearing they believe the assault might have been racially motivated. The attacker was white, the victim was Black. Morgan Daniel Barnhill, 27, originally told the officers in the Mobile Police Department he struck a man because he thought an unknown burglar was breaking into his shed on March 29. However, authorities say an investigation swiftly uncovered the man who knew the person he bashed in the head with two sharp and heavy objects. It was his neighbor, a 25-year-old Black man named Etienne Murray. An officer close to the case said, “Through the investigation, it was determined that the alleged victim (Barnhill) intentionally misled officers about an attempted burglary on the 4300 block of Windy Hill Circle East.” “Detectives discovered several inconsistencies in Barnhill’s statement,” the source continued. “And determined he filed a false report claiming an unknown male was attempting to break into a shed on his property.” Barnhill assaulted Murray with a garden shovel and a pipe and waited hours before calling authorities to report his injuries or the alleged crime he said he was preventing. Murray died three days later on April 1. Police said there were no additional details about the incident, calling it “an active homicide investigation.” Barnhill’s bail bond was set for $500,000 on April 4. Should the bond be met, he will be required to wear an ankle bracelet and stay on house arrest, WKRG reports. The deceased’s mother said the two men were friends and her son was even invited over to Barnhill’s home for a barbecue. She claimed Barnhill believed Murray stole a purse from his property. WTVY reports Linday Gayle, Murray’s mother, said, “After he beat my baby, he left him there, didn’t call for help, didn’t try for help. If he would’ve called for help, maybe my baby would still be here.” “I want him to know he has shattered my world,” the bereaved mother continued. “He took my baby, and he didn’t have to do that. If he feels like my child took something from him, why not call the police? Why not handle it the right way? Why take the cowardly way out and beat my child’s head and leave him there?” The mother said she doesn’t “want anything bad to happen” to the man responsible for her son’s death. “I don’t want him to die because I don’t want any other mother feeling the pain that I feel right now,” Gayle said. “No mother should have to bury her child, especially to senseless violence like this.” A bail bond has not been met for Barnhill and he remains incarcerated in a Mobile County Jail in Alabama.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"Police: Alabama Man Bashes His Black Friend’s Head In with a Shovel, Claiming He Thought Man Was a Burglar, Then His Story Quickly Fell Apart",https://news.yahoo.com/police-alabama-man-bashes-black-125000760.html
4/7/2022,"The House on Wednesday passed a bill that would direct President Biden to prepare a report on the government’s efforts to collect and examine evidence related to war crimes and other atrocities committed during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The bipartisan legislation passed the lower chamber in a 418-7 vote, with all those in opposition belonging to the Republican Party. A spokesman for Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said the congresswoman mistakenly voted against the bill, and plans to tell the House clerk that she meant to vote in favor. GOP Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Warren Davidson (Ohio), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Scott Perry (Pa.) all opposed the bill. Wednesday’s vote was not the first time Biggs, Greene and Massie opposed legislation responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Last month the trio voted against a bill to revoke normal trade relations with Russia, along with five other Republicans. The eight GOP members in opposition of the legislation have all worked to maintain close ties to former President Trump and have frequently found themselves in the far-right wing of the Republican Party. In a video posted online, Greene said she could not back the U.S. getting involved in the conflict because there are larger issues Americans are facing at home. Massie wrote on Twitter that he believed the bill gave the president too much authority to impose sanctions on other nations. Also last month, Biggs, Greene and Massie voted against a separate bill that called for a ban on Russian oil imports and additional sanctions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Gosar joined the trio in opposition. Biggs said he would not back a Russian oil ban without a guarantee that the U.S. would make efforts toward achieving energy independence, and Massie wrote on Twitter that he was opposing the legislation because Biden did not have plans for energy production. Gosar slammed the bill in a tweet for not making the needs of the American people a top priority. And in June, Biggs, Greene and Massie made headlines for opposing a bill that called for awarding Congressional Gold Medals to the U.S. Capitol Police and all individuals who defended the Capitol during the attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Greene told Politico that she voted against the bill because she did not like that the legislation referred to the Capitol as “the temple of our American Democracy” or that it called the Jan. 6 attack an insurrection.

4/7/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia is facing its most difficult situation in three decades due to unprecedented Western sanctions, but foreign attempts to isolate it from the global economy will fail, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday. Western countries are progressively broadening an array of economic sanctions imposed to try to force Russia to end its military operation in Ukraine and withdraw its forces. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. ""No doubt, the current situation could be called the most difficult in three decades for Russia,"" Mishustin told the Duma, or lower house of parliament. ""Such sanctions were not used even in the darkest times of the Cold War."" Western sanctions have already cut Russia off from the global financial network and left a number of its top banks with no access to the international SWIFT banking messaging system, while some traders have started to refuse Russian oil cargoes, intensifying pressure on Moscow's finances. Before the recent sanctions, Russia planned to run a budget surplus of 1.3 trillion roubles ($17 billion) this year, equal to 1% of gross domestic product. On Thursday, Mishustin said Russia would spend all it will earn this year on state aid. The government has so far pledged over 1 trillion roubles in anti-crisis support to businesses, on social payments and to families with children, of which 250 billion roubles are to be spent on state aid for the Russian Railways. Russia has introduced capital controls in retaliation for the sanctions, making it nearly impossible for foreign investors to sell their assets, both industrial and financial, if they decide to pull out of the country. ""If you have to leave, production should continue working as it provides jobs. Our citizens work there,"" Mishustin said. The Kremlin has suggested that it may nationalise assets held by Western investors who decide to depart. As some of the companies leaving are transferring their holdings to Russian companies, Mishustin said, the situation offered scope for new business opportunities. ""Our financial system, the lifeblood of the entire economy, has held up,"" Mishustin said. ""The stock market and the rouble are stabilising. I doubt that any other country would have withstood this. We did."" The European Commission proposed on Tuesday new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, including a ban on buying Russian coal and on Russian ships entering EU ports, and said it was working on banning oil imports too.
