1/19/2022,"Australia and New Zealand have started to dispatch aid to Tonga, amid fears that relief workers could bring a “tsunami of Covid” cases to the Pacific Island nation that has so far recorded just one case of the virus. New Zealand has dispatched two naval vessels with relief supplies onboard. Defence minister Peeni Henare said they were expected to arrive in four days, though could arrive as soon as Friday if the weather holds.  “Obviously [their number one task] will be to look towards how they can supply water. That’s been their number one priority,” he said. A New Zealand government update on Wednesday afternoon confirmed that no further deaths had been reported since the Tongan government’s announcement of three confirmed deaths – one Tongan woman, one Tongan man, and one British woman – on Tuesday night. Sophie Ford, international response coordinator for the Australian Red Cross, said the organisation was among a coalition of aid groups sending critical supplies for the relief effort, with a ship expected to leave from Australia on Wednesday. The HMAS Adelaide left Sydney for Brisbane on Tuesday and was due to depart for Tonga on Wednesday. Ford said the supplies include material to help provide temporary shelter and clean drinking water which may have been contaminated by the ash cloud. Tonga Red Cross is leading the local response and has prepared supplies stockpiled to support 1,200 households, but Ford said these will need to be replenished in the coming days and weeks to sustain the effort. However, Ford said aid groups were aware of Covid-19 restrictions that require people coming into the country to isolate for up to three weeks, and goods to be quarantined for days. “We’re really mindful that our response doesn’t bring any more problems,” Ford said. A senior Tongan diplomat in Canberra, Curtis Tuihalangingie, told the ABC that there were concerns of “a tsunami of Covid hitting Tonga” as humanitarian relief came to the country. Tonga has only one recorded case of Covid-19 throughout the pandemic and has maintained a strict quarantine control regime out of caution. Ford said Red Cross Australia has technical teams that will work remotely to support the local Tongan Red Cross response on the ground. “Many of those people have done deployments before so they have relationships with the existing teams on the ground,” Ford said. “Our job as internationals, I believe, is to back up those local responses: make sure we listen to what the people of Tonga say they need, and then give them it.” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday afternoon he had not yet managed to speak to Tonga’s prime minister to receive a formal request for assistance, saying a telecommunications breakdown and ash clouds have made for a “very difficult environment to be operating in”. “Any time a Pacific nation has called on us for support, we have always said ‘yes’, and so, you know, I’ll be talking to the prime minister, I hope, later today, communications allowing, and we will run through whatever else they might need,” Morrison said. Though there were initial fears the eruption and resulting tsunami may have damaged Tonga’s main airport, these proved unfounded with teams of volunteers working to clear the runway. An update from the New Zealand government on said this work was expected to finish on Wednesday, with power having been restored, clean-up efforts under way and damage assessments taking place. Henare said a Hercules is on standby ready for when the runway at Tonga’s main airport is cleared of ash and declared safe. An international mobile phone network provider has set up a temporary system on Tongatapu, Tonga’s main island, using the University of South Pacific’s satellite dish. It is expected the undersea cable will take four weeks to be repaired, leaving the countries telecommunications system operating at 10% of it usual capacity. A statement released late on Tuesday night from the office of prime minister Siaosi Sovaleni confirmed the deaths of the three people and the destruction of every home on Mango Island, home to 50 people. Only two houses remained on the neighbouring island of Fonoifua. It described the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai undersea volcano, 40 miles (65km) north of Tonga’s capital, as an “unprecedented disaster” that resulted in 15m waves.",News/World news,"First aid shipments leave for Tonga, amid fears aid workers could bring ‘tsunami of Covid’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/tonga-volcano-eruption-first-aid-shipments-leave-fears-aid-workers-could-bring-tsunami-of-covid

The manoeuvring by some Red Wall Tory MPs – dubbed the “pork pie putsch” – follows a disastrous interview given by Johnson in which he says he had not lied over the Downing Street parties.  The Guardian leads with “Clamour to oust Johnson grows as Tory MPs plot confidence vote”. It says Conservatives are discussing how to push out the prime minister and who should succeed him. Tory MPs from various ranks and wings of the party said they believed there would be enough letters to trigger a leadership contest after the publication of the Sue Gray report, it said.

1/19/2022,"When Melbourne woman Beth* called her fertility clinic on 10 January to arrange prepaid testing, she was told her procedure had been cancelled, and she would have to wait three months. Beth has been undergoing IVF for almost two years, and has had six unsuccessful transfers and two miscarriages in that time. It was hoped a biopsy, to be sent to Japan, would help to provide answers as to why she wasn’t getting pregnant.  But on 6 January, Victorian health minister Martin Foley announced a ban on all non-urgent elective surgery – including IVF treatments – in metropolitan Melbourne and major regional cities, in an effort to free up health resources amid the Omicron wave. The latest quarterly data reveals 67,596 patients are on the elective surgery waiting list – which includes some cancer treatments and cardiac surgeries. Leading IVF providers Virtus Health and Monash IVF Group warned the new regulations, which came into effect on 12 January and will last three months, would have a “devastating effect” on patients who couldn’t afford to wait for treatment. The pandemic order halted all new stimulation cycles until further notice, while allowing current cycles, urgent surgeries and preservation cycles prior to cancer treatment to continue. “There’s a lot of ups and downs, it’s a very emotional journey to go on,” Beth said. “It’s really devastating, I need those answers.” Turning 35 in May and living with polycystic ovary syndrome, Beth said she was acutely aware the quality of her eggs was starting to decrease, and she was reaching a stage where “it might just not happen”. “The quicker I can get testing done and get another chance makes such a difference. The backlog will mean clinics are having to play catch up for three months with patients who’ve missed those procedures … for some women, with medical conditions, myself included, I don’t have the option to wait, this is how I have to grow my family.” Premier Daniel Andrews on Wednesday flagged the possible easing of elective surgery restrictions for IVF and a range of other day procedures “as soon as possible” but could not provide a timeframe for when they would resume. “Let’s try and have them back up and running as soon as we can,” he said. “The most time critical procedures within an IVF journey are still happening but … I’ve heard ... just how challenging accessing it is. “It’s a very, very difficult process to go through for so many, the pandemic has made it even harder but we’ll work as hard as we can to try and get those day procedures back on and … I hope to be able to provide a positive update very, very soon.” Fertility Society of Australia president and Monash IVF medical director, Prof Luk Rombauts, said the industry had reached out to health authorities to find a way forward for the sector amid rising Covid cases. “While we understand the need not to add extra pressure on the health system during this difficult time, we can’t ignore the anguish and heartache that this has caused to so many of our Victorian patients,” he said. “It is particularly difficult for those patients who do not have time on their side, due to factors such as age and health conditions which are out of their control. “For some an extended period of time without IVF treatment may mean they will not achieve a pregnancy at all.” A Change.org petition calling for the reinstatement of IVF treatments in Victoria has gained more than 100,600 signatures online. “IVF is my only option of trying to have children,” one signee wrote. “I should not have that chance taken away and be told my treatment is considered elective. I didn’t choose to have PCOS, severe stage four endometriosis and adenomyosis. “These are all fertility-debilitating conditions and without IVF I have no hope having children. IVF is hard enough with having to worry about whether a cycle is going to be cancelled due to being classed as ‘elective’. IVF is not a choice.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Melbourne IVF medical director Dr Fleur Cattrall said IVF had continued safely during Victoria’s six lockdowns, including the Delta wave of the virus in 2020. “It’s been devastating to tell Victorian patients that they can’t start their IVF treatment for the next three months,” she said. “Many of these patients have already endured years of infertility struggles. Studies show the psychological impacts of living with infertility are comparable to the stress levels of patients diagnosed with cancer.” Other states including New South Wales have allowed IVF and fertility services to continue while suspending other elective surgeries. Prime minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday he believed there was “no choice” involved in infertility treatments, but it wasn’t a decision for the commonwealth to make. “It is a decision of the Victorian government and I appreciate the extreme pressure their hospital system is under and I can appreciate that this is a very difficult choice for the Victorian government,” he said. “But earlier on in the pandemic at national cabinet we said that IVF treatments were not elective procedures and should continue and I believe that should be done wherever possible and that should be such a last resort measure.” *Names have been changed to protect people’s privacy",News/Society,‘IVF is not a choice’: Victoria’s elective surgery restrictions cause heartache for patients,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/19/victoria-elective-surgery-restrictions-ifv-not-choice-patients
1/19/2022,"As ever, Ash Barty the person was understated. And in customary style, Ash Barty the tennis player was ruthless. Another qualifier down, another round deeper into the Australian Open women’s singles draw. This time her victim was Lucia Bronzetti, an Italian ranked 142 places lower than the Australian world No 1. She snatched two games off the Wimbledon champion, which was one more than Lesia Tsurenko managed in the opener. But it is really splitting hairs when the scoreline ends at 6-1, 6-1. This was as routine as it gets for Barty, a 52-minute stroll in the sun at Rod Laver Arena. She rolled out the wicked serve, the backhand slice and the top-spin forehand and calmly, almost quietly, slipped the win into her satchel she hopes will be full to the brim come the end of next week.  Next on the list on Friday is another Italian in 30th seed Camila Giorgi, before a potential fourth-round encounter with Naomi Osaka. “She [Giorgi] is an incredible ball-striker one of the most athletic girls out here,” Barty said. “Not afraid to stand on the baseline and put you under time pressure from the first strike. I will have to are have my running shoes on get the backhand slice out and bring in variation and see how it goes.” That variation was also on show on Wednesday, when Barty kept her opponent to seven points in the first five games and broke her five times en route to extending her unbeaten run in 2022 to six matches, having already won the season-opening Adelaide International. “I felt like we had a good preparation in Adelaide,” she said. “We played well, played throughout tough matches. [Coach] Craig Tyzzer is the master. He’s good in the business and spoilt to have him in my team. Grateful he has the tactical knowledge communication and the way we talk to each other is incredible. He’s going to love he’s on the big screen. I feel like our whole team works extremely well together. We’re enjoying our tennis and being able to produce some pretty good stuff.” The victory came on the Australian Open’s inaugural First Nations Day, of which Barty’s fellow Indigenous Wimbledon champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley is an ambassador. “She’s an incredible human being, I’m extremely lucky to call her a friend and know she’s only a phone call away,” she said. “We’re connected through our heritage. She’s an incredible woman who has paved a path and been able to guide so many of the Indigenous youth coming up in the last however many years through her work off the court. I love her to death.”",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty shows ruthless side in second-round demolition job at Australian Open ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/ash-barty-shows-ruthless-side-in-second-round-demolition-job-at-australian-open
