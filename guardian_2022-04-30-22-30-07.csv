4/30/2022,"Thousands of qualified nurses recruited by the NHS from overseas are stuck working in unskilled jobs because of unnecessarily difficult language tests, according to researchers. Nurses ​with British citizenship who have lived in the UK for ​years are among those in “regulatory limbo” because they ​cannot pass the language exams needed to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council​. The nurses have already sat ​competence exams in English, and often have years of experience working with patients in the UK. Of 857 surveyed by Salford university, more than 600 had British citizenship, which includes English tests, 79% had lived in the UK for over a decade and 17 held master’s degrees in nursing. But they are unable to practise as nurses because they can’t ​pass OET or IELTS language exams, despite in some cases having an NHS employer to vouch for their​ language skills. Jini Joy, 43, who came to the UK from India in 2007, said she had spent £3,500 on 10 attempts at the OET exam, which is designed to assess language proficiency for healthcare professionals. She passed the speaking and writing elements but struggled with the comprehension section, which requires candidates to read a text before answering 20 questions in 15 minutes. She is now working as an assistant practitioner at an NHS trust, dealing directly with patients. “We are doing almost exactly the same job as the nurses but for lower pay. It’s not fair,” she said. Critics say the exams demand an academic standard of reading and writing that many native English speakers – who typically need only a C at GCSE – would be unable to achieve. They are calling for an overhaul of the NMC’s testing requirements, which they say are “discriminatory” and worsen the UK’s nursing shortage by ignoring an “untapped doorstep resource”. The NHS is currently short of about 40,000 nurses and invests heavily in recruiting from overseas. Accepting alternative proof of language skills – such as three years working in a healthcare setting, an employer reference and completion of British citizenship exams – could allow an additional 3,000 qualified nurses ​from India ​who are already in the UK to be added to the register,​ ​according to researchers, ​as well as hundreds more from other countries, including Nigeria and the Philippines. Dr Dilla Davis, a lecturer in nursing at Salford, said the goal was not to “water down” standards and that safety was paramount: “The question is, is it fair? When you look at a native speaker, what is their literacy level and reading age? For the average person, it is not at a professorial level. But that is what we are asking of overseas nurses.” She added that the tests did not take into account the “cultural nuances of speaking”, while practical assessments did. Currently, nurses recruited from overseas are required to pass the OSCE competence exam in English as well as either the IELTS language exam, which can include questions on any subject, or the OET. Nurse and researcher Dr Agimol Pradeep, a liver transplant coordinator at King’s College Hospital, said many candidates were tripped up by the reading section. In the OET, they can be asked about anything from cancer treatments to cannabis use or genomics. “These are not everyday topics,” she said. The calls for reform are backed by high-profile figures including Andrew Foster, chair of Manx Care on the Isle of Man, and Peter Mount, a former NHS trust chair in Manchester, who have jointly written to the health secretary, Sajid Javid, calling for an urgent intervention. They claim there are “elements of racism, discrimination and exploitation” in the matter, with nurses wrongly “trapped into lower-grade” roles. “These are nurses who are considered good enough to give safe care to patients in care homes but are blocked from registered nurse jobs and appropriate salary for very poor reasons,” they wrote. Mount told the Observer it was wrong that qualified nurses who had proved themselves competent English speakers were being excluded from registration in the midst of a critical nursing shortage. “We’re not for a moment saying, ‘Have no language testing’. We’re saying, ‘Give credit for experience,’” he said. “We’ve got cases of nurses who’ve taken this 15, 16 times. Some have given up and gone to work for Tesco.” The Nursing and Midwifery Council said it was reviewing its English language requirements to ensure the approach was fair. It has set up an advisory group and scheduled a public consultation for the summer. Matthew McClelland, executive director of strategy, said: “It’s essential that everyone joining our register can communicate well in English, wherever they trained. “Nurses and midwives spend the most time with patients and people who use services, and effective communication is fundamental to high quality, person-centred care. “Over 17,500 professionals who trained outside the UK joined our register in the 12 months to the end of September 2021 alone, and the vast majority of them have taken one of the English language tests.”",News/Society,Overseas nurses barred from profession due to ‘discriminatory’ language exam,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/30/overseas-nurses-barred-from-profession-due-to-discriminatory-language-exam
4/30/2022,"Arcade Fire’s USP is a kind of neurotic ecstasy: everything’s terrible (especially the internet), let’s dance. Their muscular opening number, Age of Anxiety I, is proof of concept. Win Butler plunges into the crowd while Régine Chassagne rakes the room with handheld green lasers and merrily chants: “Anxiety!” Above them, on the backcloth, a giant red eye surveys the action. It’s a reference to Yevgeny Zamyatin’s We, the 1920s dystopian novel that inspired the title and theme of their new album. Arcade Fire have been banging the technosceptic drum for years (their 2007 song Black Mirror predated the TV show) but if they talk a lot about the vital importance of human connection in a digital era, then they also walk the walk. The stage is a throng of bodies jumping from instrument to instrument. There’s three of everything – guitars, keyboards, drum kits – not to mention the occasional double bass, accordion and keytar. It’s like the fully expanded Talking Heads lineup at the end of Stop Making Sense, but for the full two hours, and louder. The grand reopening of the refurbished Koko in London after a three-year silence is a comeback for the band, too. Like U2’s Pop 20 years earlier, 2017’s dance-pop symposium Everything Now was a bridge too far, met by muted reviews and stuttering ticket sales. The far superior We has been viewed as a course correction back towards apocalyptic rock but it’s less a retreat than a merger. The electro-disco throb and whoosh of Age of Anxiety II (Rabbit Hole) slides neatly between Reflektor and Creature Comfort in a body-moving sequence that is every bit as exciting as early anthems Wake Up and Rebellion (Lies). Like the new album, the setlist ties together every phase of their career and grants coherence to what has sometimes sounded like an identity crisis. Arcade Fire may be operating without the hi-tech shenanigans of their arena shows but they still have Chassagne, who is a human special effect and an inexhaustible engine of joy, whether she’s pounding the drums, busting out a dance routine with orange luminescent wrist bands or triggering a belt that radiates a skirt of red lasers. More than ever, it feels as if Robyn has formed a band with Jonathan Franzen. Butler’s constant striving for a transcendence that is just out of reach is probably what gives Arcade Fire their electrifying urgency but there is a fine line between inspiring the crowd to surrender to the moment and sounding like an exasperated dad who wishes that his kids would turn off their phones for one goddam minute. Before the gospel-like My Body Is a Cage, a rare pause for breath, he asks three times for silence. “I’m not trying to be an asshole,” he says quasi-apologetically. “I just think it would be beautiful if nobody talked.” He’s not wrong though. It is. Arcade Fire work hard to make you feel that, right here, right now, you are experiencing something unrepeatably wonderful.",Arts/Music,Arcade Fire review – maximalist wonder that roots you in the here and now,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/30/arcade-fire-review-maximalist-wonder-that-roots-you-in-the-here-and-now
4/30/2022,"Contained within 95 pages of dense legal jargon, the warning from Twitter to Elon Musk was clear: don’t use your considerable power on the social media platform to attack the company. The world’s richest man and owner-in-waiting of Twitter signed an agreement for the planned $44bn (£35bn) takeover last week confirming that he could tweet about the deal so long as “such tweets do not disparage the company or any of its representatives”. Yet hours later the self-described “free speech absolutist” was engaging with tweets criticising senior Twitter staff, including an interaction with a political podcast host who had labelled the company’s legal head, Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s “top censorship advocate”. The inevitable consequence for Gadde was one of the grimmer phenomena of social media: a pile-on. Comments included calls for her to lose her job and, in a typical example of unpleasant digital hyperbole, statements that Gadde would “go down in history as an appalling person”. Announcing the deal to buy Twitter last week, Musk said: “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.” Musk has a history of contentious tweets but his Gadde post fuelled concerns in some quarters about the Tesla chief executive’s idea of free speech. Will it come at the cost of protecting Twitter users from abuse, cyberbullying and extremist content? “I think that Musk’s conception of free expression is both contradictory and foolish,” says Jillian York, a free speech activist and the author of Silicon Values: the Future of Free Speech Under Surveillance Capitalism. “Absolutism on a platform like Twitter fails to take into account the very real harms that Twitter can cause as a global platform, for instance being used by malicious actors like Isis and rightwing extremists.” She adds there is a difference between the idea of freedom of speech as embodied by standing on a platform at Speakers’ Corner in London and online, where you can “scream into the void to billions of people”. She says: “Platforms like Twitter are a completely different animal and you’re talking about somebody’s ability to ruin someone’s life in an instant.” The Gadde post elicited a wave of expressions of support, and criticism of Musk, from current and former employees. A group of female Twitter employees, under the handle @TwitterWomen, posted “the women at Twitter are the best of us” while the platform’s former chief executive, Dick Costolo, accused the billionaire of “making an executive at the company you just bought the target of harassment and threats”. There is also speculation that Musk will allow banned figures back on to the platform, including former president Donald Trump, who has denied that he wants to return after his account was permanently suspended in January 2021. Nonetheless, The Wall Street Journal reported this weekend that Musk is “dismayed” that Trump remains banned. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a US-British campaign group, has said that reinstating people such as Trump, extreme-right pundit Katie Hopkins and InfoWars founder Alex Jones would mean that Twitter’s safety rules “don’t exist any more”. The deal, which is backed by the board but must be approved by shareholders, has also raised concerns about one person controlling such a major platform. Twitter is significant even though the majority of its 217 million daily users get their news elsewhere. In Europe only 9% of people use Twitter for news, rising to 12% in North America, 14% in the UK and 35% in Africa, according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ) at Oxford University. But those people who do use Twitter are the political and media equivalent of influencers – journalists, commentators, celebrities and politicians. “The fact that many politicians, powerful individuals and pundits are frequent users, and that some journalists feature what they say in their reporting, mean Twitter is clearly an important part of how the political and media agenda is set,” says Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of the RISJ. “In that sense, a rich business magnate owning it raises the same kinds of issues as wealthy individuals controlling influential news media or other social media platforms. It’s a political question how individual countries want to regulate such ownership.” The deal is not expected to face scrutiny from competition authorities in the US but politicians are starting to address the question of internet regulation, and the issues over free speech that come with it. Landmark laws are being introduced in the UK and the EU and they will have a direct impact on the shape of Musk’s town square. In another post-agreement tweet last week, Musk acknowledged that individual states’ conception of freedom of speech would trump his own. He wrote: “By ‘free speech’, I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.” But the law – in the UK and the EU – is about to change. In the UK, the government is introducing the online safety bill, which imposes a duty of care on tech companies to protect users from harmful content. Some of the content it covers is already banned by the likes of Twitter, specifically posts containing things that are criminal in the offline world, such as terrorist or child sexual abuse content. But it will also require major platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and TikTok to deal with “legal but harmful” content – in other words posts that fall below the threshold of criminality but can still cause psychological or physical harm. This has alarmed free speech advocates (York calls it “dystopian”) but Musk will have to abide by it – the British communications regulator, Ofcom, could fine companies up to 10% or their turnover for transgressions of the law. “Services that operate in the UK are subject to UK regulations. Online platforms are no different to services in other sectors. Once enacted, Twitter will need to satisfy Ofcom that they are complying with the duties to protect users,” says Maeve Walsh, a policy consultant who helped shape the regulatory framework behind the bill. At the same time, the EU is implementing the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires the major social media platforms to do more to tackle illegal content. This includes forcing them to allow users to flag such content in an “easy and effective way” so that it can be swiftly removed. “Twitter, even owned by Mr Musk, needs to moderate content to comply with EU rules. If he wants to do business in EU, that’s a fact,” says Christel Schaldemose, a Danish MEP and the chief negotiator on the DSA. In the US, content moderation has been a hotly debated topic for years among legislators. While there is some bipartisan support for reforms, the subject of how and whether platforms should be held liable for content published on their sites remains controversial. By “free speech”, I simply mean that which matches the law.I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 currently absolves platforms of responsibility for content posted by others. Both Trump and President Joe Biden have stated their support for a reform of section 230, albeit for different reasons. Republicans have claimed, largely without evidence, that rightwing voices are being censored while Democrats say platforms are hosting harmful content, disinformation and misinformation without consequences. But campaigners say reforming or repealing section 230 could do more harm than good: it could prompt companies to delete wide swaths of posts, even if they are not harmful, for fear of running foul of the law – perhaps in the process denying oppressed groups one of their most powerful platforms. “Section 230 is a foundational law for human rights and free expression globally,” says Evan Greer, the director of digital rights group Fight for the Future. “Regardless of what Musk wants to do, changing section 230 would make it even harder for platforms like Twitter to moderate harmful content through a human rights framework, and more likely that platforms would remove wide swaths of legitimate content in order to avoid litigation.” Also contained within the deal to buy Twitter is a $1bn break fee, which could be payable by either side depending on the circumstances of how the deal falls apart. As it becomes increasingly clear that implementing his free speech vision faces significant hurdles, Musk may consider it a fee worth paying.",News/Technology,The price of free speech: why Elon Musk’s $44bn vision for Twitter could fall apart,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/30/elon-musk-why-44bn-vision-for-twitter-could-fall-apart
4/30/2022,"The 80s weren’t easy for my parents. My mum is English and Dad is from Zambia, where he’d been a top engineer, but he couldn’t find work after moving to the UK – he was a window cleaner for a while. It was an honourable job, but he was always trying to find a way out. Scottish nature is stunning. We moved to Aberdeenshire when I was four and at weekends we’d take a picnic and an inflatable boat to the River Don. You take those moments for granted as a kid. Everybody’s a musician in Zambia. Visiting family there gave me a deeper understanding of myself. It was so alien being brown in Scotland. Culturally, I didn’t fully fit in either place, but for many mixed-race people that’s the life you settle with. You have to be a citizen of the world. Mum and Dad knew I loved music from a young age. We couldn’t afford tickets to Cinderella, so Mum cycled to work instead of taking the bus until she’d saved enough money. I watched The Little Mermaid again and again, and my dad wrote out all the lyrics of Under the Sea, so I could practise singing. My partner and I met when we collaborated on a track for my new record. Having her knowledge as a classical pianist was beautiful. Slowly we got closer… and here we are. It’s so nice to have a piece of music to mark how we met. Coming out this year taught me that you have to be yourself. I’m lucky to live in a place where I can announce my relationship with a woman. Everybody is spiritual. When I was younger I read the Bible and tried to find faith there. Now I think on a wider scale. Rihanna told me she liked my hair and I was so starstruck, I literally couldn’t speak and just stared at her. Next time, I’ll have a script ready. Receiving an MBE for my services to music was a proud moment. There’s rejection and hardship before you break into this industry, so recognition at any level is always lovely. Cutting my hair was probably the starting point of embracing myself. We try to control the natural things about ourselves because we’ve been told to be something else. Every part of my life now is authentic and it feels so refreshing. My mum has always said that you can’t please everybody and have to let go now and again. It’s a relief to let life flow. Pigeons scare me. I had a face-off with one once, and the pigeon won. It spread its wings, made the loudest sound ever and I fell and twisted my ankle. Everyone in my family laughs about it.

4/30/2022,"Western society has enthusiastically shaken off lots of the old, restrictive taboos that once policed behaviour. In fact, today the very idea of being “normal” has been exposed as a bit of a sham when it comes to sexuality, brain type, or even “life goals”. But there is one area where the pressure to conform is still woven through our expectations and conversations, as well as through the marketing images that surround us all: the ideal of motherhood. Now the American film-maker Therese Shechter is tackling what she believes is a pervasive bias in favour of women having babies. Her provocative new documentary, My So-Called Selfish Life, has already been admired at festival screenings, with Ms magazine describing it as a “striking and imaginative documentary, which addresses [an] oft-overlooked facet of reproductive justice”. On May 6, it will go out to the wider world on Show&Tell, a streaming platform for documentaries.Although Shechter never disparages parenthood, she knows it will ruffle feathers. “I don’t relish making anyone angry, but that’s what happens when you have an opinion. And this is important to talk about,” she says. “I am not evangelical in the least, and I’m not negative about people who want children.” Shechter describes herself as “anti-pronatalism”, which means she is opposed to the defining templates imposed on women, but not to the basic notion of raising a family. “It’s important to talk about this thorny question without pitting parent against non-parent,” Shechter adds. “It is just that women should now be treated like adults who know what is going to be good for us. At the moment we don’t have full body autonomy. There’s interference coming from what society values, from religious beliefs and from some bad science. All of it says it’s our job to have babies.” Shechter herself chose not to become a mother and, from this perspective, she interviews several women who feel the same, from the crusading 1970s feminist Marcia Drut-Davis, to Shanthony Exum, who has opted to live with a group of friends, rather than start a family. As BBC Radio 4 prepares a new reading to celebrate Bridget Jones, the fictional 90s “singleton” who had such entertaining neuroses, the pressure on young women remains strong. Last summer the British writer Emma John’s book Self-Contained came out to acclaim, while the columnist Nell Frizzell, author of 2021’s The Panic Years, launches her debut novel, Square One, this summer. A comedy, it focuses on the looming targets still set for women. Frizzell has also just made a radio documentary, Mother, Nature, Sons, about how her concern about climate change has affected her own view on parenthood. Is it actually selfish to consider having children when the future of the environment is so troubling? The whole guilt-ridden debate feeds directly into one of Shechter’s main arguments. “There are so many ways women are called ‘selfish’ or ‘narcissistic’, usually for doing what they want to do,” she says. “The attempt to limit our choices is also a good way to control society. Women are often accused of putting themselves first when they don’t want a baby. Yet then they are asked, ‘Who will look after you when you are older?’ as if that isn’t a selfish concept.” Some of the unconscious policing is done by what Shechter calls “concern trolling”, whereby women without children are offered sympathy, whether they need it or not. “Of course, there are many women who want children and cannot have them. I can’t speak for them, but I don’t think it helps for society to keep saying that having a child is the single thing that makes people the most happy.” Her film questions whether it can be coincidence that the idea of a ticking biological clock arrived just when women began to enter the workplace. In the 1970s any rejection of what Shechter calls a phoney biological imperative was regarded as radical and dangerous. Drut-Davis’s belief that motherhood was not going to be for her led to being interviewed for the leading US TV news show 60 Minutes on Mother’s Day in 1974. She was filmed telling her in-laws that she had decided not to have children, in a broadcast that changed her life. “I never regret what I did because I’ve learned through challenges,” she says this weekend. “I wish I knew more about pronatalism and how editing can affect how I was perceived. My then husband hardly was heard, although he was very animated during the long interview. He was edited out! I was the mean bitch breaking in-laws’ hearts, when he was equally in acceptance of the child-free lifestyle.” Drut-Davis recalls the show ending with the presenter apologising into the camera lens: “Pardon our perverseness in airing this on Mother’s Day.” In her book, John faces down the same insistent call to duty and the fear of an internal ticking clock. “I thought I’d got through my 20s and 30s without too much worry about being single or motherhood. But then I realised I had always thought of myself as just ‘pre-married’,” she says. “In my 40s there were a lot of internal narratives I suddenly had to deal with. Marriage and having children are the markers of adulthood. If you step off this conveyor belt, does that mean you are infantile? Are you irresponsible because you are not taking care of anyone else?” But then came an “eye-opening experience” for John in lockdown, as she cared for her parents during her mother’s final illness. “My sister was nine months’ pregnant with her second child and so a lot of it naturally fell to me. This is in many ways a traditional role for an unmarried daughter, but it also showed me a caring side to my nature and I realised I was not so selfish.” John points out that even today women are regularly celebrated only as wives or as mothers. And Shechter’s film also looks at this pernicious side of the traditional ways that women are validated. Her own mother, who appears in the film, does not approve of Mother’s Day, it is revealed, because it raises one woman above another. “My mother is a self-effacing person and she grew up in Europe, where the tradition was not such a big thing,” says Shechter, who is based in New York, “but she also rightly feels it is a problematic day for lots of people for many reasons.” The dressing up of motherhood in ribbons and bows, for Shechter, is tantamount to coercion. Fertile women, she argues, are placed on a pedestal by society as a way of duping them into accepting the difficult and limiting world of child-bearing. It is akin, as the pioneering American psychologist Leta Hollingworth set out more than a century ago, to the way that men are prepared for war. “In her brilliant essay Hollingworth showed there was also the same emphasis on service and sacrifice in compelling someone to enlist for something that was likely to lead to the loss of their life, since childbirth was the biggest killer of women at the time.” What then lies ahead today for a woman who does not stake her security in old age on creating a new family? For Exum, one of Shechter’s powerful screen interviewees, the prospect of growing old among friends is a more reliable one. “The assumption that a child-parent relationship will be perfect or easy is false,” she says, in explanation of her choice to live a childless domestic life with friends. “Like any relationship, it takes work to truly understand the other person and patience and openness to communicate and truly listen. I know some people who have fabulous relationships with their parents and children, while some have more fraught ones. Nothing is guaranteed, so I feel the assumption is the dangerous part.” My So Called Selfish Life (watch.showandtell), made by Trixie Films, is the third in a trilogy of documentaries by Shechter, each intended to dismantle common beliefs about womanhood. Her first was about power and feminism, and the second, sex and virginity",News/Society,The parent trap: why is it still seen as selfish to opt out of being a mother?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/30/the-parent-trap-why-is-it-still-seen-as-selfish-to-opt-out-of-being-a-mother
4/30/2022,"Dressed in a prim, billowing white dress, Mitski holds her microphone high over her head, bringing it down very deliberately towards her. The song she sings is called Working for the Knife, from her recent sixth album, Laurel Hell – her most commercial outing yet, full of lush 80s productions and electronic drama. And the mic is a dagger aimed at Mitski’s soft parts. Working for the Knife can be read as a generalised cry of defeat in the face of dehumanising work. More specifically, it relays Mitski’s own internal struggles as an artist. In 2019, the US singer-songwriter decided to quit music after one final concert, exhausted to the point of dissociating from gruelling tours and the expectation that, as a confessional female singer, nothing in her life was off limits. Having quit, force majeure thrust this intense, thoughtful artist – it’s no exaggeration to call Mitski a Lana Del Rey or Taylor Swift for watchful, yearning outsiders – back into the ring. Owing her record company one more album was probably the main driver. Then she had an unexpected pandemic TikTok hit. Mitski’s 2018 song Nobody – a cry of existential loneliness on a par with the Smiths – found her desperately flinging open windows to hear “sounds of people”. Although she wrote the song about an ill-considered solo holiday to Kuala Lumpur, TikTok unexpectedly made Nobody into a lockdown anthem, introducing her to a new generation of fans. The audience bellow it so loudly they drown Mitski out, something that happens often tonight. It turns out that she also found it unexpectedly difficult to stop turning her thoughts into tunes. So Working for the Knife – and the album that sits around it – is a glossy document of deep ambivalence and abject surrender. In that it far exceeds its grudging remit, it’s a close cousin of Charli XCX’s latest contract-fulfilling pop bomb Crash; there are shades, too, of Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear, a pointed double album addressed to his ex-wife, who stood to gain half the royalties. Mitski, it seems, has accepted her fate: “dying for the knife”. By the end of the song, she has crumpled to the floor. It has become rote to complain about artists complaining about being famous. But in Mitski’s case, this is just the latest chapter in a long and seething existential melodrama, in which this artist coolly interrogates selfhood over and over: who to be, how to be and, chillingly, sometimes, whether to be at all. All of these extremes of emotion are squeezed into taut songs and artful performances that draw from mime, Antonin Artaud’s theatre of cruelty and the ideas of RSC director Peter Brook. This daughter of a Japanese mother and American father moved around a lot as a child, spending time in Turkey, China, Malaysia, the Czech Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, code-switching as she went. If army brats and third culture kids had an unofficial poet laureate, it would be Mitski. But her work speaks intimately to anyone whose indoor world varies from that of the dominant culture outside. Her 2016 song Your Best American Girl – a euphoric mid-set bounce-along – confronts Mitski’s failed efforts to supersede differences in upbringing. “Your mother would not approve of how my mother raised me,” she sings tartly, “But I think I do.” Tonight, Mitski’s stylised performance ranges far and deep into her back catalogue, as though she were still saying goodbye. A paper aeroplane stands in for the real thing on Goodbye, My Danish Sweetheart, a deep cut from 2013. Even though her indie rock mid-period allowed Mitski to beat American boy suburbanites at their own genre, there is, perhaps, a touch too much of it tonight. It’s a boon for longtime fans: what devotee would not want to hear 2014’s Drunk Walk Home, the first time Mitski sang “fuck you and your money?” But it leaves less room for her other killer moves, like the more hypnotic Laurel Hell tracks where Mitski turns feral and menacing, inviting trouble in. This is an artist whose stylistic voice only grows stronger with every record. A white door stands at the back of the stage, teasing some of those darker themes from Laurel Hell. But that door is never opened; Mitski merely raps on it with her knuckles on one song, the bleak knockabout pop of Should’ve Been Me. That door may yet give in time; Mitski is not retiring. Having supported Lorde on tour in 2017, she is set to perplex more stadiums with Harry Styles later this year. “Until next time,” she specifies, in parting.

4/30/2022,"Like a deranged game of limbo, Republicans seem to be in competition to see just how low they can go. A couple of weeks ago a Republican in Tennessee was lecturing homeless people on how they should look at Hitler (who spent some time living on the streets) as an inspiration. This week, a Republican in Ohio is both-sidesing rape. On the one hand, Ohio state representative Jean Schmidt mused during an Ohio house government oversight committee meeting on Wednesday, rape is bad. On the other hand, you’ve also got to find the silver linings. “Rape is a difficult issue,” Schmidt said. “But if a baby is created, it is a human life and whether that mother ends that pregnancy or not the scars will not go away, period. It is a shame that it happens, but there’s an opportunity for that woman – no matter how young or old she is – to make a determination about what she’s going to do to help that life be a productive human being … That child can grow up and be something magnificent, a wonderful family person, cure cancer, etc.” As you will have gathered, Schmidt’s remarks on rape were delivered during a debate on abortion. Republicans in Ohio are trying to pass a “trigger ban” that would immediately criminalize abortion in the state, without any exemptions for rape or incest, if Roe v Wade is overturned by the supreme court. Because Republicans are extremely pro-life, as they love to remind us, the ban kindly makes an exemption for abortion in cases where it might save the life of the pregnant person. But you’ve got to get two doctors who aren’t professionally related to sign off on it first–which, of course, will be very easy to do when you’re in the middle of a medical emergency. You know where there’s absolutely no exemption? Abortion in cases where a child is raped. Schmidt’s remarks were delivered in reply to a Democratic colleague had specifically asked her if her bill would force a 13-year-old girl who is raped to have the baby. It’s this very specific scenario that Schmidt chose to present as an “opportunity”. This, let us remember, is a representative from a party which likes to present itself as a champion of “family values” and postures nonstop about protecting children from abuse. The Republican party is also the party with the idea that the left is intent on indoctrinating and brainwashing schoolkids with wacky ideas like “racism and sexism are bad”. Which is strange because, for a party that doesn’t want kids to be brainwashed, it sure loves to do a bit of a brainwashing itself. Back in 2010 when Schmidt was a congresswoman, she took it upon herself to lecture a group of elementary school students – some of whom were as young as six – about how abortion involves killing a child before its born and is wrong. That’s not brainwashing, folks, that’s religion! I’m not sure it’s really helpful to call the Republican party a “party” any more. That suggests that its ideas operate within a respectable and reasonable arena. Which, let’s be very clear, they don’t. The Republican party is becoming a full-blown extremist organisation: one that is intent on rolling back every single right that women and minorities have fought to achieve. And if you think calling Republicans “extremist” is, well, extreme, please tell me how else you’d like to describe a party that seem to think it is righteous and good to force a child to carry to term and give birth to a baby conceived by rape – and then, just to add insult to injury – want to ensure that there is no governmental support when it comes to raising that baby? What makes things worse is that these people aren’t just morally bankrupt hypocrites they’re dangerously effective hypocrites. They’re bad at moral consistency but they’re very good at consolidating power. Could the prehistoric woman have it all? She certainly tried to, according to a new book about the women in prehistory. Rather than there being a strict gendered division of labour, the book argues that the stone age was actually rather advanced with “cooperation between all members of the group, regardless of their gender or age.” Birds of a feather flock together! The advert comes after the death of 23-year-old Ashling Murphy, who was attacked while out running along a canal in Ireland, earlier this year. She wasn’t running at 2am (when very few women would feel safe running as anyone with a brain ought to realize) but in the afternoon. Births carried out at home or in community birthing centers increased by 20% from 2019 to 2020 according to a new study with non-white communities driving the rise. The increase for Black, non-Hispanic women was 30%, followed by 26% among Native Americans, 24% for Hispanic women and 18% for both Asian and white women. Someone tell that to British politicians please. Addressing a science and technology committee inquiry on diversity and inclusion Katharine Birbalsingh said “physics isn’t something that girls tend to fancy. They don’t want to do it, they don’t like it.” She added: “The research generally … just says that’s a natural thing. I don’t think there’s anything external.” The mind boggles. It’s taken almost a decade to do, but earlier this month Indonesian lawmakers passed a bill targeting sexual violence. The law expands the definition of rape to include rape between a married couple and acknowledges nine variations of sexual violence, including online sexual violence. A new study has discovered what every pet owner may already suspect: your dog’s personality may have little to do with its breed and popular stereotypes about dog breeds are not supported by science. Researchers couldn’t find, for example, a genetic basis for aggressive behaviors nor a link to specific breeds. It turns out “there is a huge amount of behavioral variation in every breed, and at the end of the day, every dog really is an individual”. There’s a lesson for humans there somewhere.

4/30/2022,"The wife of the Tory MP under investigation for allegedly watching porn on his phone in the House of Commons only found out when a reporter called her about the story. Sue Parish, 66, said she first became aware of her husband Neil’s suspension from the Conservative party when a journalist got in touch looking for a comment. “I didn’t know anything about it until he rang and said, ‘Oh, you know what I’m ringing about’,” she told the Daily Telegraph. “I didn’t know who was more embarrassed, actually, me or him. Poor chap.” It appeared the Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon had given his wife a satisfactory explanation for the incident and the couple were able to joke about it, despite the inquiry. “My wife is amazingly loyal and better than I deserve,” Neil Parish said, to which his wife replied “that’s for sure” while chuckling, according to the report. Sue Parish previously told the Times that the accusations were “all very embarrassing”, adding: “My breath was taken away, frankly. “People shouldn’t be looking at pornography. He would never just sit there with people looking. He would never just do that knowing [people were looking]. These ladies were quite right to be as [upset] as they were.” Describing her husband as a “normal … lovely person”, she said: “If you were mad with every man who looked at pornography, you would not have many wives in the world. “It’s degrading. It’s demeaning. But on the other hand it takes two to tango. There must be women posing for all this.” Her husband, a senior Tory MP of 12 years and the chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, had the whip suspended after becoming the fourth MP from his party since the last election to face claims of impropriety. He told the Telegraph it felt “almost as if a weight is lifted off me” now the allegations were out in the open. He said he had not yet spoken to Boris Johnson and added: “Whatever people may say, I’ve been a pretty hardworking MP and I shall carry on doing so until such time as I make a decision either to remain or to go.” When asked what happened, Parish said he had viewed the porn “by accident”, although he did not elaborate on how this had happened.",News/Politics,Wife of Neil Parish says she first heard of porn claims from reporter,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/wife-neil-sue-parish-first-heard-porn-claims-from-reporter
4/30/2022,"When it became clear to Liliia Fomina that the war raging outside her hometown of Zaporizhzhia would continue not just for days, but months or even years, she decided that she wanted to flee to the UK. A sponsor in Windsor was found, and on 18 March the 29-year-old applied for a British visa for herself and her five-year-old son Lev. The pair sheltered with friends of friends in a village near Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine, and waited: one week, two weeks, three weeks. By the time her visa finally came through, after almost a month of uncertainty, the lawyer had changed her mind. Instead of boarding a flight to Britain, Fomina and Lev travelled by coach and train to Berlin, where she had found a family via a Facebook group who had agreed to house them for six months. The journey took 32 hours. Less than 12 hours after arriving in the German capital last Monday night, she had obtained a provisional residence permit, got hold of a free sim card for her phone, opened a bank account, and found a free place at a church-run nursery for Lev, who is named after the Russian writer Tolstoy. By the end of the week, Fomina had also obtained German health insurance and been handed the first instalment of a monthly benefits payment of €616 (£516) for her and her son, as well as a one-off €294 payment to buy new clothes, all in cash. “The word of mouth on Ukrainian Telegram [social media] groups was that it would be much easier to integrate into German than British society,” Fomina told the Observer. “Our British sponsors seemed very friendly and willing to help, but there was very little available information about the benefits system or how easy it would be to find work. “After four days in Berlin, I’m 100% sure I made the right decision.” Seven years ago, Germany’s “refugee crisis” caught the attention of the world, when Angela Merkel’s government opened its borders to an influx of asylum seekers, most of them fleeing the war in Syria, triggering a rightwing backlash that saw the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) enter parliament for the first time. In the first two months of Russia’s aggression, 390,000 Ukrainians have arrived in Germany, more than twice the number of Syrians who were registered with Germany’s quota system in September and October 2015. Yet this time the word “crisis” is nowhere to be heard. Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine has seen Germany’s government dithering over shipments of arms and an embargo on Russian energy imports, to the frustration of its European allies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has at times looked more concerned with respecting the doveish traditions of his centre-left party and heeding the pleas of German industry than addressing a rapidly changing geopolitical situation. But in its dealings with an unprecedented influx of newcomers from Ukraine, Europe’s largest economy has been uncharacteristically unbureaucratic, drama-free and outward-looking. The number of arrivals in Germany is dwarfed by those in countries directly on Ukraine’s borders – especially Poland, where more people have found a shelter from the war than in all other European countries combined. Yet in Liliia Fomina’s Telegram groups there are many Ukrainians in Poland voicing concerns they could get trapped in poorly paid menial jobs, and the expectation is that many of her compatriots will make use of the EU’s 90-day visa waiver to move further west. Going by national governments’ official numbers, Germany is their most likely destination: more Ukrainians (almost 400,000) are already here than in other large European states such as France (51,000), Italy, (about 100,000) and Spain (135,000). Britain, outside the EU and with a slow-moving visa system in place, has taken in only about 27,000, although 86,000 visas have been granted. Unlike the Syrians who arrived in 2015, Ukrainians in Germany do not have to apply for asylum but can obtain a quick residence permit valid for up to three years, thanks to the previously unused paragraph 24 of the German residence act. Unless they opt for Berlin, which relocates those who haven’t found accommodation for at least six months before they arrive to other parts of the country, they are free to choose where to live, and can start working almost immediately. Those in non-regulated professions such as the care sector are likely to have their qualifications recognised without having to prove them in an exam. The overhauled system has helped people like Alina Shchukina, 35, who left Kharkiv with her eight-year-old son amid heavy shelling on 3 March. Within two weeks of arriving in Berlin, her host family had helped her get an interview to be a legal assistant a corporate law firm. The job offer arrived on the same day. “I was genuinely surprised because everything happened so quickly,” she said. “Germany makes it very easy for Ukrainians to get benefits. But I couldn’t have sat around waiting for the war to end. I am not that kind of person.” Activists who have spent years campaigning for a reform of Germany’s immigration and asylum laws are delighted. “Instead of looking at these refugees only as victims who are expected to return to their homeland as soon as they can, there’s a genuine effort to integrate them into the labour market,” said Katarina Niewiedzial, Berlin senate’s integration officer. “I dare not say it, but I think we’re witnessing a paradigm change.” The change is especially surprising because immigration authorities appeared to have been caught by surprise by the outbreak of a war that had been threatened for months. When thousands of Ukrainian refugees started arriving at Berlin central station in early March, volunteers complained they had been left to shoulder the burden. Andreas Ahrens, a pensioner from Hamburg, opened up his late father’s home in the northern German city’s outskirts to a group of Ukrainians in mid-March. “We didn’t have to think about it for long: it was a decision we made within a few minutes,” he said. “Syria and Afghanistan, those places feel very far away, but Ukraine is right on our doorstep.” For other Germans, religion, ethnicity and gender may also have been factors making them more willing to share their living space with refugees than in 2015. Seven years ago, two-thirds of asylum applicants in Germany were male, even though the gender balance among Syrian refugees in Germany has recently tipped the other way. Of the newly arrived adult Ukrainians who are receiving benefits in Germany this year, 83% are female. For the last two years of his life, Ahrens’s father had lived in the four-storey house on his own. As of last month, it provides a home to five mothers and eight children. “Whenever I walk around the neighbourhood now, I can’t stop noticing how many houses in our neighbourhood are standing empty and could shelter more people,” he added. “It’s madness.” Finding empty homes to permanently house the Ukrainian diaspora is going to be a challenge, especially in large German cities that are already suffering a chronic housing shortage, such as Berlin. Unlike the Syrians and Afghans who arrived before, Ukrainian passport-holders are not bound to the municipalities they have been allocated to, but can vote with their feet where they want to live and work. “The immigration system that Germany has developed for Ukrainian refugees is in many ways a desired outcome,” said Peter von Auer, a legal adviser to refugee rights advocacy group Pro Asyl. “We’ve spent years arguing that free choice creates a fairer system.” Tarek Alkouatly, 23, arrived in Germany from eastern Ghouta in October 2015, fleeing the war in Syria as an unaccompanied minor. After his arrival, he spent a night at Dortmund’s Fritz-Henßler-Haus, a youth centre repurposed as a temporary refugee shelter. Seven years later, Alkouatly is back at the same centre, this time as a volunteer, helping Ukrainians fill out forms in bureaucratic German and transporting food and blankets in his seven-seater car. “I came to Germany without speaking the language, and that was at times extremely stressful,” said the Syrian, who is currently completing his secondary school education while working as a courier in the evenings. “Now that I speak German, I see it as my duty to help.” “Ukrainians have seen war, bombs and death like us, wrought by the same enemy. If you’ve only seen war on TV you might want to help them, but not as strongly as when you’ve experienced it yourself.” Asked how he felt about Ukrainians being able to participate in German society without having to overcome some of the same the legal and bureaucratic hurdles that faced him and his compatriots, Alkouatly said: “If I am being really honest, it can feel a bit unfair sometimes. “But of course I am happy they have fewer problems. It would just be nice if that was the same experience of all those fleeing war in the future.”",News/World news,Ukraine refugees flock to Germany after being put off by UK red tape,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/30/ukraine-refugees-are-flocking-to-germany-and-shunning-the-uk
4/30/2022,"Afew were prepared to give Neil Parish the benefit of the doubt pending the result of the inquiry. But most people in the Devon market town of Tiverton on Saturday had very little sympathy for their MP. “He should just admit what he’s done and get out,” said Hannah Tucker, 32, a supermarket worker who was shopping with her husband, Liam. “The Tories are a joke. They get up to all sorts – and most of the time get away with it. They’ve to be stopped.” Liam, a highways technician, said it was never acceptable to look at the sort of material Parish is alleged to have viewed in the workplace. “The scandals keep on coming. I’ll never vote Tory.” Katy Oakley, 40, an ecologist, was walking through the town with her four-year-old daughter, Olive. “This sums up what everybody thinks about the government, another shocking incident in a long line. “I think it shows just how out of touch members of the elite are with normal society. They think they can get away with things that ordinary people couldn’t. “This isn’t brilliant publicity for our town – it puts Tiverton in a bad light. It’s not good for the country’s image abroad. And it’s not good for society.” Thomas, a middle-aged man selling candy floss in the town’s historic pannier market, said his wife would “slit my throat” if she caught him watching pornography. “If it’s proved he’s done it, he’s got to go. He’s a member of our parliament and he has to have the respect to do it properly.” The worrying thing for Thomas was that it did not come as a surprise. “To be honest, nothing surprises me now. That’s how bad it’s got.” Although Parish lives on his farm across the border in Somerset, he is a well-known figure in Tiverton. He was first elected 12 years ago and since then has doubled his majority. The Tory MP for North Devon, Selaine Saxby, said Parish had always been a loyal and supportive colleague. But she expressed shock: “Nobody wants to think of their MP sat on the green benches watching videos full stop, certainly not this kind of video.” Speaking on BBC Radio Devon, she also suggested he could be accident prone. “There isn’t a colleague that is more likely than Neil to have the kind of accident he has described. I think anyone who has slips of the finger or is a bit shortsighted as we get older will know the first thing we want to do is try to turn it off. That might involve peering at your phone quite intently.” Gillian Evans, the chair of Tiverton and Honiton Conservatives, would not talk, referring callers to Conservative HQ. Happily for the Tories on Mid Devon district council, which is based in Tiverton, councillors are not up for election this spring. “I guess that’s a good thing,” said Ray Radford, a senior Conservative councillor who is also the council chair. “I don’t really know what to make of it,” Radford added. “It’s taken us all by surprise. As far as I’m aware he’s an honourable MP who’s served the constituency well. We’ll have to see what the inquiry shows.” At the pannier market, wood turner Max Hall, 59, said it was simple. “If he is found guilty he should be sacked and if they can get back some of the money he’s been paid as an MP, they should. He seems to have shown a total lack of respect for everyone who has voted for him.” Hall’s wife, Jane, 56, added: “When people are scrimping and scraping, he’s sat there apparently watching porn. He should be sacked but he’s got Boris as his role model. He was having a party when people were dying.”",News/Politics,‘He’s got to go’: anger in Tiverton as local MP Neil Parish faces porn claims,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/anger-tiverton-local-mp-neil-parish-faces-porn-claims
4/30/2022,"Anthony Albanese will provide help for Australians on low and middle incomes to buy houses by giving eligible applicants a commonwealth equity contribution of up to 40% of the purchase price of a new home, and up to 30% for an existing home. The Labor leader will unveil the new $329m housing initiative as the centrepiece of Labor’s official campaign launch in Perth on Sunday. If Albanese wins on 21 May, Labor’s new shared equity housing policy will be implemented in addition to the Morrison government’s First Home Guarantee scheme. To qualify for help under the shared ownership scheme, eligible homebuyers will have to have saved a deposit of 2% and qualify for a standard home loan with a participating lender to finance the remainder of their purchase. Australians with a taxable income of up to $90,000 for individuals and up to $120,000 for couples will be eligible to participate in the program which Labor has called Help to Buy. Successful applicants will need to be Australian citizens and not current home owners. Labor says successful applicants for the scheme will also avoid the need to pay lenders mortgage insurance, which represents a saving of around $30,000. Home buyers under the scheme will have the option of taking additional equity in the property over the life of the home loan. They will not have to pay rent on the proportion of the house owned by the commonwealth. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The new scheme is modelled on programs that already exist in the UK and in some Australian states, including Western Australia, which has the Keystart scheme. Over time, the program is expected to deliver income for the commonwealth as the government recovers its equity and its share of the capital gain when the properties are sold. The new policy comes as the campaign conversation has shifted to the economy, rising cost of living pressures and home mortgage rates. A surge in inflation over the past 12 months confirmed in the latest official figures from the Australia Bureau of Statistics has led to speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia will increase interest rates during the election campaign, creating a political headache for the Morrison government. In a statement ahead of Sunday’s Labor campaign launch, Albanese said the new home ownership program would address an affordability crisis by cutting the cost of a mortgage by up to $380,000 in some parts of the country. He said Australia was in the grip of a housing crisis because of surging prices. The Labor leader noted the biggest drop in home ownership as a consequence of a lack of affordability was amongst Australians on low and modest incomes “who have been forced to give up on the great Australian dream”. Albanese said 40 years ago, almost 60% of Australian on low and modest incomes owned their own home, but because of price trends, the percentage of homeowners in those income brackets had fallen to 28%. He said after nine years in government, housing affordability had only gotten worse under the Morrison government. The shadow housing minister, Jason Clare, said Labor was pursuing the policy because it is “harder to buy, harder to rent and there are more homeless Australians than ever before”. He said the program would help Australians buy a home with a smaller deposit, a smaller mortgage and smaller mortgage repayments. “This will help a lot of Australians buy a home with a smaller mortgage that they can afford to repay, instead of renting for the rest of their lives”. Labor is launching its campaign in Perth for the first time since 1940 as part of an attempt to pick up three Liberal-held seats in the west – Swan (on a 3.2% margin), Pearce (5.2%) and Hasluck (5.9%). The party will also attempt to sandbag the ultra-marginal seat of Cowan held by Anne Aly. Sunday’s launch will be Albanese’s most significant campaign event since emerging from home isolation on Friday after a coronavirus infection. Albanese hopes electoral gains in WA will be the bedrock of Labor’s pathway to victory on 21 May. On the hustings in the west on Saturday, Albanese promised $125m in new funding for 135 locally made electric buses as part of a plan to shore up onshore manufacturing.",News/Australia news,Labor to help low and middle income earners buy home with shared ownership scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/labor-to-help-low-and-middle-income-earners-buy-home-with-shared-ownership-scheme
