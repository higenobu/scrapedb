3/7/2022,"Oil prices have soared more than 10% and are closing in on their all-time high levels after the risk of a US and European ban on Russian crude threatened a stagflationary shock for world markets. The global benchmark of Brent crude hit US$139.13 a barrel at the start of trading on Monday, a leap of more than $20 on Friday’s close of $118.03. The all-time of $147.50 was reached in July 2008 but some analysts think that mark could be surpassed because of the geopolitical impact of the Ukraine crisis. Although the price slipped back to $130, consumers still face higher household energy and petrol costs, while inflation will rise across the board if businesses are forced to pass on higher fuel expenses. The price of natural gas is closely linked to crude oil and is sure to lift again. Gas prices set a new record high mark on Friday in the UK, for example, when national balancing point (NBP) benchmark soared above 500p a therm. CHART OF THE DAY: The Brent crude oil market, since the launch of futures in June 1988 to today (nominal prices). The high today was $139.13 a barrel, still below the all-time high of $147.50 a barrel set in July 2008. #OOTT #Ukraine pic.twitter.com/VynyshFCt8 Stock markets are looking at big losses when Monday’s trading day begins, with the Nikkei in Japan down 1.50% in futures trade, the FTSE100 off 3.55% and the S&P500 down 1.25%. Having climbed 21% last week, Brent crude was further energised by the risk of a ban of Russian oil by the US and Europe. “If the west cuts off most of Russia’s energy exports it would be a major shock to global markets,” said Bank of America chief economist Ethan Harris. He estimated the loss of Russia’s 5m barrels could see oil prices double to $200 a barrel and lower economic growth globally. Commodity prices in general are having their strongest start to any year since 1915, Bank of America said. Among the many movers last week, nickel rose 19%, aluminium 15%, zinc 12%, and copper 8%, while wheat futures surged 60% and corn 15%. That will only add to the global inflationary pulse with US consumer price data this week expected to show annual growth at a stratospheric 7.9%, and the core measure at 6.4%. It leaves a tough decision for the European Central Bank when it meets this week against a backdrop of a sharply falling euro. The nightmare scenario of stagflation – where inflation combines with stagnating growth – looms for the world economy. “Given the potential for stagflation is very real, the ECB is likely to maintain maximum flexibility with its [quantitative easing] programme at €20bn through the second quarter and potentially beyond, thus effectively pushing out the timing of rate hikes,” said Tapas Strickland, an economist at NAB. “Higher inflation forecasts, though, mean rate hikes will be needed on the horizon.” With the outlook for European growth darkening, the single currency took a beating and fell 3% last week to its lowest since mid-2020. It was last down 0.6% at $1.0864 and risked testing its 2020 trough of about $1.0635. It has also lost a lot of ground against the pound, which now buys €1.214. The dollar was broadly firmer, supported in part by a strong payrolls report which only reaffirmed market expectations for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve this month. The dollar index was last at 98.812 having climbed 2.3% last week. Gold benefited from its status as one of the oldest of safe harbours and was last up 0.7% at $1,983 an ounce.",News/Business,Oil prices near all-time record as US and Europe consider ban on Russian crude,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/oil-prices-near-all-time-record-as-us-and-europe-consider-ban-on-russian-crude
3/7/2022,"A new code of practice for universities will aim to stop the practice of making “conditional unconditional” offers to avoid students making choices that are not “in their best interests”. The offers give students a place regardless of their exam results, but only on the condition they make the university their firm first choice. Their use has risen in recent years but was temporarily banned by the Office for Students – the body responsible for regulating universities – at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. After an 18-month review, Universities UK (UUK), which represents the sector, will publish its code of fair admissions on Monday, setting out how processes must support “student choice”. The code will say that universities should not make “conditional unconditional” offers, or offers with significantly lower grade requirements based on applicants making their institution a firm choice. The practice has been widely criticised over concerns that it demotivates students from working hard for their A-level grades and fulfilling their potential. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that they welcomed the “absolute clarity with which it reinforces the message that the use of so-called ‘conditional unconditional offers’ is unacceptable”. The code will also say that unconditional offers should be used in limited circumstances, for example where admissions are informed by interviews or auditions, and that incentives to students should not place “undue pressure on the decisions that applicants make, or the timescales in which they should make them”. Data published by Ucas in 2020 showed that in 2019 there were 35 universities and colleges where at least 1% of offers made were “conditional unconditional”. Universities will be expected to sign the new code but it will not be compulsory. A cross-sector group will evaluate how effective the code is after its publication. Prof Quintin McKellar, UUK’s vice-president for England and Northern Ireland, said: “The Fair Admissions Code of Practice allows universities and colleges to make a public commitment to prioritise applicants’ interests above all else.” The minister for higher and further education, Michelle Donelan, said: “These changes really help to put university applicants’ needs first. Prospective students should expect clarity from the provider and the course about quality, transparency and fair access.“I have long called for these much-needed changes to the admissions process such as increased transparency in advertising and also called out the use of conditional unconditional offers which only really benefit the university or college. “This code highlights the undue pressure this places on applicants to make a decision which may not be in their best interests.”",News/Education,Universities advised against ‘conditional unconditional’ admission offers ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/07/universities-advised-against-conditional-unconditional-admission-offers
