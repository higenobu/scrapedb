1/3/2022,"Sri Lanka is facing a deepening financial and humanitarian crisis with fears it could go bankrupt in 2022 as inflation rises to record levels, food prices rocket and its coffers run dry. The meltdown faced by the government, led by the strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, is in part caused by the immediate impact of the Covid crisis and the loss of tourism but is compounded by high government spending and tax cuts eroding state revenues, vast debt repayments to China and foreign exchange reserves at their lowest levels in a decade. Inflation has meanwhile been spurred by the government printing money to pay off domestic loans and foreign bonds.  The World Bank estimates 500,000 people have fallen below the poverty line since the beginning of the pandemic, the equivalent of five years’ progress in fighting poverty. Inflation hit a record high of 11.1% in November and escalating prices have left those who were previously well off struggling to feed their families, while basic goods are now unaffordable for many. After Rajapaksa declared Sri Lanka to be in an economic emergency, the military was given power to ensure essential items, including rice and sugar, were sold at set government prices – but it has done little to ease people’s woes. Anurudda Paranagama, a chauffeur in the capital, Colombo, took on a second job to pay for rising food costs and cover the loan on his car but it was not enough. “It is very difficult for me to repay the loan. When I have to pay electricity and water bills and spend on food, there is no money left,” he said, adding that his family now eats two meals a day instead of three. He described how his village grocer was opening 1kg packets of milk powder and dividing it into packs of 100g because his customers could not afford the whole packet. “We now buy 100g of beans when we used to buy 1kg for the week,” said Paranagama. The loss of jobs and vital foreign revenue from tourism, which usually contributes more than 10% of GDP, has been substantial, with more than 200,000 people losing their livelihoods in the travel and tourism sectors, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. The situation has got so bad that long queues have formed at the passport office as one in four Sri Lankans, mostly the young and educated, say they want to leave the country. For older citizens, it is reminiscent of the early 1970s when import controls and low production at home caused severe shortages of basic commodities and caused long queues for bread, milk and rice. The former central bank deputy governor WA Wijewardena warned the struggles of ordinary people would exacerbate the financial crisis, which would in turn make life harder for them. “When the economic crisis deepens beyond redemption, it is inevitable that the country will have a financial crisis too,” he said. “Both will reduce food security by lowering production and failing to import due to foreign exchange scarcities. At that point, it will be a humanitarian crisis.” One of the most pressing problems for Sri Lanka is its huge foreign debt burden, in particular to China. It owes China more than $5bn in debt and last year took an additional $1bn loan from Beijing to help with its acute financial crisis, which is being paid in instalments. In the next 12 months, in the government and private sector, Sri Lanka will be required to repay an estimated $7.3bn in domestic and foreign loans, including a $500m international sovereign bond repayment in January. However, as of November, available foreign currency reserves were just $1.6bn. In an usual approach, government minister Ramesh Pathirana said they hoped to settle their past oil debts with Iran by paying them with tea, sending them $5m worth of tea every month in order to save “ much needed currency”. The opposition MP and economist Harsha de Silva recently told parliament that foreign currency reserves would be -$437m by January next year, while the total foreign debt to service would be $4.8bn from February to October 2022. “The nation will be totally bankrupt,” he said. Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal made public assurances that Sri Lanka could pay off its debts “seamlessly” but Wijewardena said the country was at substantial risk of defaulting on its repayments, which would have catastrophic economic consequences. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa’s sudden decision in May to ban all fertiliser and pesticides and force farmers to go organic without warning has brought a formerly prosperous agricultural community to its knees as many farmers, who had become used to using – and often overusing – fertiliser and pesticides, were suddenly left without ways to produce healthy crops or combat weeds and insects. Many fearing a loss decided not to cultivate crops at all, adding to the food shortages in Sri Lanka. The government made a dramatic U-turn in late October and farmers are now struggling to cover the high costs of imported fertiliser without help. “The costs of cultivating paddy [wheat] have gone up astronomically … The government has no money for fertiliser subsidies. Many of us farmers are reluctant to invest money because we don’t know if we will make any profit,” said one farmer, Ranjit Hulugalle. In an attempt temporarily to ease the problems and stave off difficult and most likely unpopular policies, the government has resorted to temporary relief measures, such as credit lines to import foods, medicines and fuel from its neighbouring ally India, as well as currency swaps from India, China and Bangladesh and loans to purchase petroleum from Oman. However, these loans provide only short-term relief and have to be paid back quickly at high interest rates, adding to Sri Lanka’s debt load. Anushka Shanuka, a personal trainer, was among those who used to have a comfortable life but now is struggling to get by. “We can’t live the way we used to before the pandemic,” he said, saying the prices of vegetables had gone up by more than 50%. “The government promised to help us but nothing came, so we are just managing the best we can. I don’t know how much longer we can go on like this.”",News/World news,‘There is no money left’: Covid crisis leaves Sri Lanka on brink of bankruptcy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/covid-crisis-sri-lanka-bankruptcy-poverty-pandemic-food-prices

1/3/2022,"The global art market performed at record levels in 2021, with billions of dollars being paid for works by impressionist, postwar and contemporary artists, and much of it bought by people whose wealth comes from cryptocurrencies or other technologies. More than $2.6bn (£2bn) of art was sold in two weeks by leading auction houses in New York in November. Four works by Vincent van Gogh sold for $161m, including $71.4m paid for Wooden Huts Among Olive Trees and Cypress Trees.  In May, Jean-Michel Basquiat’s 1983 2-metre-tall painting In This Case became 2021’s single most expensive painting to change hands when it sold for $93m. The sale in November of 35 works from the Macklowe Collection – by Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, among others – totalled more than $676m. Landscape by Nicolas Party went for $3.2m, doubling the Swiss artist’s previous record. “The art market is certainly frothy. And I think the audience for art is larger than it’s ever been. We’re seeing record levels in the 277-year history of our company,” said Charles Stewart, the chief executive officer of auction house Sotheby’s. Art market experts say demand that was pent up in 2020 by the global Covid pandemic has released at the same time as sought-after artworks are being put up for sale. “There has been an extraordinarily high level of quality material coming to the market and that has drawn the attention of buyers,” said Stewart. It is not only paintings that are commanding enormous sums. Last month, the Hamilton Aphrodite, a Roman sculpture dating back to the first or second century AD, established a new world record for an ancient marble sculpture when it sold in New York for almost $25m, smashing its pre-sale estimate of $2m-$3m. Luxury auctions at Sotheby’s – including streetwear and skateboard decks as well as jewellery, watches, handbags, wines and whiskey – totalled more than $1bn for the first time in 2021. And a non-fungible token (NFT) of Everydays: the First 5,000 Days by Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as Beeple, sold for a record $69m in March, making him “among the top three most valuable living artists”, according to Christie’s. “It’s true that the market is performing at record levels, and certainly outperforming most people’s expectations,” said Katharine Arnold, the head of postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s. However, the market for old masters was less buoyant, with sales at auctions last month down almost 20% on comparable sales two years ago. According to the 2021 Contemporary Art Market Report, $2.7bn worth of contemporary art was sold at auction in the 12 months to June, representing a “stronger, more diverse and denser market than ever before”. Experts attribute the booming market to at least three factors, which may overlap: young “crypto-driven” buyers; the growth in the Asian market; and the belief that art is a good investment at a time of economic uncertainty. People who have made fortunes from cryptocurrencies and other technologies “are now participating at very high levels”, said Stewart. “They are young and they are global.” In November, Sotheby’s accepted live bids in the ether cryptocurrency – favoured by the digital art and NFT community – for the first time in the sale of two works by Banksy, Trolley Hunters and Love Is in the Air. They sold for $6.7m and $8m respectively. Cryptocurrency payments had become “a viable alternative to fiat currency”, said Arnold. In November, a cryptocurrency group amassed more than £47m, or 11,600 ether, in a few days on its online crowdfunding page in an attempt to buy a rare surviving copy of the US constitution. They were outbid by a hedge fund boss and art collector, Kenneth Griffin. Buyers from Asia accounted for 40% of sales in the contemporary art market in the year to June 2021, beating the US (32%) and the UK (16%). The Asian market has “effectively become the world’s primary zone for the exchange of contemporary artworks”, said the Contemporary Art Market Report. According to Sotheby’s and Christie’s, Asian buyers account for a third of major international sales. Last year Sotheby’s broke records for sales in Asia, reaching $1.1bn by the end of November. Another factor supporting this moment in the market was investors looking at “tangible works of art as stores of value” in a time of rising inflation, said Arnold. She added: “I don’t think this is a bubble, not at all. The conditions in the world at the moment are such that art continues to be a way of storing value. And there is constant wealth creation and new buyers entering the market.” There had been a 50% increase in millennials buying and bidding in Christie’s London sales in October, she said. “If the baby boomers were the ones buying aggressively in years past, we’re starting to see a generational shift, and that means that growth doesn’t only come from new markets like Asia, it also comes within the established markets as the younger generation steps in.”",Arts/Art and design,Crypto tycoons help drive global art market to record levels in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/02/crypto-tycoons-global-art-market-record-levels-2021
1/3/2022,"It’s rare that the quiet part is said out loud in British politics: the thing that arrives in a chilling soundbite a politician has let slip, or in correspondence leaked many years after those who wrote it leave power. If you have ever, for example, scoffed at the idea that the rightwing press has a hold on British politics, particularly over the Labour party, then an incident that took place 20 years ago may still your rolling eyes. Last week we learned that after Stephen Lawrence’s murder Tony Blair‘s Downing Street initially opposed an inquiry into police relations with minority ethnic communities.  The arguments for the government’s objection formed a checklist of the hesitations, prevarications and cynical cautions that still stalk efforts to confront institutional racism today. In his initial note recommending an inquiry, Jack Straw, then the home secretary, wrote, “There is clear disquiet, not least within the black community, about the issues raised by this case. I believe that the best way to address these, and draw something positive from this tragic case, would be to launch a broader inquiry into police relationships with ethnic minority communities generally.” Then he hedged, preempting what an uncomfortable proposition that was for Downing Street. “I am concerned,” he said, “that this should not be perceived as undermining the police but as an opportunity to identify and promote good practice.” But even that was not enough to reassure jittery colleagues. In the margins, an official whose identity was unknown addressed Blair’s policy adviser, Liz Lloyd, asking, “Is this sensible?” “No,” replied Lloyd. Others weighed in, saying “an inquiry would raise expectations” that would be hard to achieve, and “even with good presentation” the inquiry would “look like an attack on the police”. You will notice that all these concerns were about the optics rather than the substance of the issue, and the priority was protecting the police and not the Lawrence family or the ethnic minorities whose concerns they represented. Still, perhaps there is nothing that surprising about a government trying to tread carefully when it comes to something as profoundly unsettling as an investigation into police bias towards ethnic minorities. Perhaps there is nothing surprising in government officials defaulting to cost-benefit analyses; one hardly expects the ranks of advisers to be staffed with racial justice warriors instead of steely reputation managers. And Sir William Macpherson’s inquiry did eventually go ahead, such was the undeniable stench of it all and the pressure the Lawrence family wielded. But there is a kicker to the story, and in it we see how the cynicism of self-preservation prevailed at the expense of doing something long-term and substantive about race relations. Shortly before Macpherson published his report, Straw proposed a follow-up – an ambitious strategy that would prioritise race equality considerations in policymaking across government bodies. Yet taking on racial justice in such a direct manner was just too risky, too destabilising to the government. “A regulation nightmare,” said Blair. Angus Lapsley, an official in Blair’s private office, decided not to back a proposal that racist police officers should be dismissed (government was “cool” towards this suggestion, he said), not because the policy would be wrong, but because of how rightwing papers would react to it. Here is where the decibel level rises. “This could easily become a ‘Telegraph cause celebre’ if taken too far,” said Lapsley. Blair agreed, saying: “We do not want to go OTT on this.” The proposal was killed. There is a sort of sickening relief in seeing those sentiments – expressed behind closed doors – spelled out so matter of factly; in knowing for certain that concerns about racial injustice aren’t taken seriously not because they’re not believed but because they rock the boat. Indeed, the smothering of a broad, progressive race policy 20 years ago tells us much about where we are today, with a government proudly hostile to interrogating the true state of race relations. On ethnic minority matters, there is far more continuity between the Labour party and the Conservatives than there are material differences. Both parties share a notion that matters of race are merely a government liability and not something for which the government should take direct responsibility. Last year, that notion was manifest in the shape of the widely discredited report by the Sewell Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities. The denial and dishonesty in that document about the extent of the country’s institutional racism was just one step away from Blair’s timidity in front of the rightwing gallery. He passively did not want to upset the Telegraph and its reactionary contingent; today’s Tories actively want to please it. But what Labour and Tory leaderships have both exhibited is deference to a status quo that preserves racial hierarchies and refuses by default to acknowledge any criticism that might challenge Britain’s moral sense of self. Such is the slippery slope of “moderation”. An unquestioned assumption has developed that the left can prosper in this country only if it sheds “radical” notions of social justice and redistribution that are unrealistic and extreme – that are, in Blair’s words, “OTT”. The best we can hope for is that the good guys go about pursuing change incrementally and surreptitiously. This is an abdication of responsibility, but ultimately it’s worse than that. Lost opportunities to achieve racial equality don’t just throw ethnic minorities under the bus: they are also missed chances to shape the values of the country. Labour’s realpolitik on race may have saved a few fights and stabilised careers in the short term, but in the medium term it also has tilted the ground in favour of the right. And it has sent all of us, marginalised minorities and resentful majorities, hurtling down that slope towards an ever more fractious future.
