1/28/2022,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Danilo Masoni LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities are due a rebound after Wednesday's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, several indicators based on market levels and positioning are signalling. Share markets have taken a beating as investors have ramped up bets that an era of ultra-low interest rates and vast pools of liquidity that boosted risk assets is fading quickly. The Fed is expected to signal later in the day that it will embark on policy tightening with rate hikes and balance sheet cutbacks. Global stocks have lost 7% so far in 2022, with the Nasdaq Composite set for its worst start to the year since 1980 as high-flying technology shares fall out of favour. But many reckon markets may have found a temporary bottom. Goldman Sachs told clients the falls did not indicate a ""danger zone"" had been reached and that its risk indicator models suggest markets are nearing levels that are considered good entry points for longer-term investors. Citibank too advised investors to consider buying into market dips. Based on a series of 18 metrics it said the number of ""red flags"" on U.S. markets was far lower than before the 2008 crisis and the bursting of the dotcom bubble. Below are some more indicators signalling conditions for a bounce: 1/OVERSOLD TERRITORY Chartists have been watching the relative strength index (RSI) to gauge oversold conditions for U.S. indices after this month's ructions. A level below 30 is traditionally seen as indicating a selloff has gone too far and pointing to a short-term bounce. All three major U.S. benchmarks are trading below that level, and the Nasdaq 100 - which has shed $3 trillion in market value this year - fell all the way to the lowest since December 2018 at 25.4. ""U.S. markets are now looking oversold. I sense a rally,"" one UK-based trader said.

AAII https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbvgnwrgapq/AAII.JPG 3/TAKING PROFITS FROM SHORTS Net short positioning across U.S. benchmarks also points to a near-term bounce, potentially triggered by investors locking in profits from successful bearish bets. While the S&P has switched from net long to net short, Nasdaq positioning remains net short and according to Citi, the most ""negatively extended"". Recent selling was more sentiment-driven than linked to new macro data, the bank said, adding that Nasdaq futures positioning was a ""one-sided short with profit levels rapidly rising which could lead to a short-term rebound."" Overall, the futures flows picture implied ""weak conviction,"" they added. (Reprinted with permission of Citi Research. Not to be reproduced.)

The CBOE put-to-call ratio has hit its highest since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, signalling investors may be getting too pessimistic in the short term. Put options confer the right to sell at a pre-agreed price and calls allow holders to buy. putcall https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwxmkdpo/putcall.JPG (Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee in London and Danilo Masoni in Milan; Editing by John Stonestreet)",Business/Reuters•2 days ago,Market signals scream buy after world stocks tumble,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-signals-scream-buy-world-133429566.html
1/28/2022,"Rivian's stock has an electric amount of upside potential.  At least that is the good word from top Wall Street auto analyst at Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas.  The often headline-making Jonas — known for his bullish calls on Rivian rival Tesla — thinks Rivian's stock warrants at least a 160% surge from levels he believes are overly depressed. ""An IPO that preceded the December market top, the reality-check of supply chain bottlenecks (normal in auto land, perhaps not normal in tech land), and the gut-check of having partner Amazon exercise its right to secure EDVs from alternative vendors (Stellantis, Daimler) has shaken investor confidence and, we think, provides an excellent opportunity to gain exposure to a company, product cycle, and business model that we believe has a greater chance [of] being a winner in this industry than most other EV competitors. While Rivian is at a far earlier stage in its industrial journey than Tesla, we do not see this company as just a ‘concept stock’ either. The road to ramping production will be choppy, but we expect largely due to supply rather than demand,"" said Jonas in a new research note to clients.  Jonas has a $147 price target on Rivian.  Shares are down some 48% year-to-date to $53.94, swept up into the vicious interest rate fear driven rout in highly valued companies not earning any money. The company went public at a price of $78 a share on Nov. 15, 2021. It hit a closing high of $172 on Nov. 16.  Not helping market sentiment on Rivian is a mixed quarter out of Tesla on Wednesday night, a few weeks removed from its own earnings report.  Tesla shares plunged 12% to $829 on Thursday's session as Tesla said its business would be weighed down by supply chain challenges, mostly as it relates to semiconductor shortages. The company also said it would not unveil any new models this year. Rivian's stock plunged 10.7% in Thursday's trading in sympathy.  The upstart electric truck maker hasn't done much on its part to shake off the bears, either.  In late December, Rivian said it would delay its electric pickup and sports utility vehicle featuring larger battery packs until 2023. And earlier this month, Rivian revealed it missed its 2021 production target by making 1,015 EVs versus its expectations for 1,225 pickups and SUVS. Analysts see Rivian losing a whopping $5.2 billion in 2022 as it ramps up production.  ""While we are impressed with demand for Rivian's initial vehicle models, list of investors, and balance sheet/liquidity position, the stock's valuation, forthcoming competition in the electric truck/SUV space, and potential quality-related concerns keep us on the sidelines. Additionally, we do not foresee profitability until mid-decade at the earliest,"" CFRA auto analyst Garrett Nelson said in a note.   Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
