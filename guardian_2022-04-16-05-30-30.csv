4/16/2022,"Small boat arrivals on the Kent coast have expressed fears that they will be removed from the UK and transferred to Rwanda, after hearing the government’s announcement that asylum claims will be processed offshore. “If they send me to Rwanda, I will not go. I will die here, I will take my life,” Jemal, a new arrival from Eritrea, said. “Do you know how many thousands of miles I travelled to be here? How long I was in [the] desert …? To reach this point, to be here, we all had to make so many sacrifices. A lot of [people] lost their lives on the sea. I left my country now – I cannot go back to Africa.” “No one knows Africa like we Africans do,” another man from Eritrea said. “Africa is Africa – there is no freedom there. Rwanda is like Eritrea, it does not keep human beings safe. Here in Europe, you are free.” Of the group of 22 migrants, all said they would take their own lives, rather than face removal from the UK to Rwanda. “100%, people will lose their lives by themselves,” a man from Sudan agreed. “Some, they will go up to the hills [the cliffs] here, some they will go to the train, to the sea, to any place. This one is the human rights problem, not only in Rwanda.” “I don’t know where Rwanda is – all I know is it is dangerous there,” said a member of the group from Iraqi Kurdistan, gathering around a map. “Last night I could not sleep … thinking, thinking all the night what will happen to me. We do not know the culture in Rwanda. It is so different from what we know.” Many among the group said they believe that only new arrivals from Africa would be transferred to Rwanda; those from other nationalities felt confident they would not be sent there. “I come from Iran – the government, they will not send us to Africa … only Africans,” a man from Iranian Kurdistan said. The Eritreans and Sudanese said they also believed only Africans would be transferred to Rwanda, if the plans went ahead. The group had mixed views about whether the prospect of removal from the UK would act as a deterrent to those attempting to cross the Channel. “I think it will stop people from coming here,” an Eritrean man said. “Maybe they will decide to stay in France, maybe go to Germany, places like [that].” “People will always want to leave, they will always need to live safely,” another man said. Many said they thought the Rwandan government had struck the deal with the UK for economic reasons. “It is for money. Rwanda is a small country. It is a poor country. They need British money. It is only for this.” While all the new arrivals said they hoped the government would drop its plans, they thought there was a high likelihood they would go ahead. “Everything, it is easy for them. I think they will do it,” they agreed. “Money, it is not a problem here [in the UK]. It is a problem for Rwanda – that is why this is happening. But we hope, we hope, they will cancel it.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247.

4/16/2022,"The prime minister has been in trouble for so long I’d almost forgotten the Scott Morrison that surfaced this week – the Morrison that barnstorms around the country with impeccable message discipline. But in true Easter spirit, Campaign Morrison rose from the dead, locked and loaded for his next big May miracle. Anthony Albanese, not so much. After goading Morrison to call the election for a fortnight, the Labor leader fluffed his first pop quiz on day one – a damaging stumble for reasons that have been well ventilated throughout this week. The television news reports on the night of Albanese’s unemployment rate gaffe were beyond breathless – news anchors asked their travelling correspondents whether or not Albanese had just lost the campaign. On day one. It’s possible of course that a future Labor campaign review will conclude that Albanese lost the 2022 election on day one. But calling that eventuality on day one seemed brave given there’s a multitude of hours, days, nights and weeks between now and 21 May. The return of Campaign Morrison prompted me into a thought experiment. I’ve wondered at various points this week whether this Liberal leader, at his best, is the most effective political campaigner I’ve covered in my reporting lifetime. Morrison is better than John Howard, who was diabolically clever, but with an overhang of social awkwardness. Better than Julia Gillard, who struggled to be seen or heard in a misogynistic melange. Better than Malcolm Turnbull, who, in his exciting times, lacked a visage of non-threatening ordinariness. So better than them. That left me with the other two devastatingly effective campaigners I’ve studied at close range – Tony Abbott and Kevin Rudd. Abbott and Rudd, like Morrison, were ruthless and relentless. They were also intuitive. Morrison is more researched and rehearsed and mimetic than intuitive. But when it comes to campaign competence, this might be a distinction without a difference. I want to reassure you at this point my purpose here isn’t theatre criticism. There’s a substantive point coming. Morrison, Abbott and Rudd are an interesting professional trio, if we stop to think about it. All knew how to win elections. And all struggled with the critical bit that follows the campaigning: the governing – the bit that actually matters. Abbott, who only knew how to wreck, had no visible talent for the prime ministership at all. Given how atrocious he was, it was astonishing he lasted as long as he did. The progressive technocrat Rudd had a mind that never stopped racing. He went at everything like he was shot out of a cannon. This was the crux of his problem. It led to his removal from the top job, effectively on a backroom impulse. Morrison is a brusque managerialist of variable competence who lives to dominate. His organising principle is power. There’s no substantive agenda beyond it. As I said in a Quarterly Essay back in 2020, borrowing from Gertrude Stein – with Morrison, there is no there there. The first 12 months of the pandemic was a fruitful time for Morrison’s managerialism. That was the best of him. But as I said a week ago, the worst of Morrison is up there with the worst I’ve ever seen. The moral of these musings is simple. Some of our best political campaigners have been either deficient (Abbott), unmanageably chaotic (Rudd) or both obdurate and oddly directionless (Morrison). Yet voters learn this once the campaign ends. As these deficiencies are consequential, this feels like a trend we should have a close look at. But there are barriers to doing that. The first is, if we did that, seriously and systemically, we’d be pushing against the campaign lionisation complex, which has become an industry for both in politics and the media. We need to be honest about this. Campaigns are king. The whole ecosystem has become addicted to the sugar hits of engagement the political cycle serves up in orderly three-year cycles. To see the whole and not the part, we’d also have to better engage a voting public that only tunes in for election campaigns, and even then, only out the corner of one eye. This is tough because voters are disengaged because they lack the privilege (and that’s exactly what it is) of time to reflect. People also feel they have better things to do than think about the quality (or otherwise) of a political class from whom they feel alienated. Understanding these realities, and seeking to prosper inside them, Morrison spends a lot of time encouraging people to look away from the routine processes of deliberative democracy – activity he’s branded “bubble stuff” – a deeply insidious bit of marketing if ever there was one. So let’s agree that significantly disrupting the status quo would require a level of sustained engagement and good faith currently lacking in our democracy. Given that’s our present reality, let’s observe the following in good faith and good heart: here we find ourselves again, pounding along in the human horse race that stops the nation once every three years. We’ve entered a six-week campaign that someone wins and someone else loses. That’s the matrix we are in. So assessed within the reductionist and not entirely enlightening terms of that matrix, Campaign Morrison dominated the message war of the first six days through a combination of his own significant mental discipline and adulatory media amplification. Albanese contributed by failing to stick the dismount from the parliamentary theatre to the hellscape of the hustings. This week will have reminded the Labor leader that the hustings are no place for extemporising humans, and campaigns are no country for the messy ebbs and flows, concentration lapses or confidence dips that humans tend to exhibit. Given I strive to keep things meaningful, the times being so very serious, and democracy being so very precious, let’s also be attentive to what matters. Let’s be very clear that Campaign Morrison isn’t getting things all his own way. The Liberal party leader is being shadowed, as he should be, by the substantive deficiencies of his prime ministership; by his tendency to just slide on through and talk over people inclined to linger around the deficiencies. This story of Alan Tudge, a minister both in and out of the cabinet, and the mystery of the $500,000-plus payout from taxpayers to the former Liberal staffer Rachelle Miller, is absolutely extraordinary. Want details about any of that? Think anyone in the government might believe themselves accountable? Are you mad? Talk to the hand. Next question. Astonishing, too, that Morrison stood up this week in broad daylight and tanked the integrity commission he told Australian voters he’d constitute three years ago. I normally consider comparisons between Morrison and Donald Trump to be hyperbolic given Morrison still orienteers along a reality plane. But to ditch an important integrity pledge in plain sight, and blame everybody else, is Trumpian-level chutzpah. Perhaps the blast he’s copping as a consequence of this atrocity will prompt a campaign reset. But let’s be clear: Morrison declared this week that when it came to pressing ahead with the federal integrity commission, it would be his heavily criticised proposal, or nothing, which meant it will be nothing unless the coming election either consigns Morrison to history or forces him to bargain for the government’s political life. Then it might be something. But if Morrison has his way, it will be nothing. This is obviously very bad. But it actually got worse. In his quest to inoculate himself against a clear broken promise, Morrison also continued to run down the state body established in 1988 to investigate and expose corrupt conduct, and actively prevent it – the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. This was a “kangaroo court”. What Morrison told voters this week, in very clear terms, was that he believes in the clash of rights between the political class and the public, the political class should win. Politicians have more of a right to safeguard their reputations than the public has to a strong anti-corruption cop on the beat keeping close watch on the most powerful people in the country. Given the Morrison government is excoriated semi-regularly by the Australian National Audit Office, that position is deeply troubling. We can thank Morrison’s precision communications skills for laying this choice out so clearly. I’d encourage voters to reflect on that very carefully.",News/Australia news,Australia now remembers Scott Morrison can campaign. But will voters forget the past three years? | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/16/australia-now-remembers-scott-morrison-can-campaign-but-will-voters-forget-the-past-three-years
4/16/2022,"Anthony Albanese says he will legislate a national anti-corruption commission by the end of 2022 if Labor wins the election. Albanese’s commitment, to be confirmed on Saturday, follows Scott Morrison declaring this week he will only revive his government’s heavily criticised integrity commission proposal if Labor and the Senate are prepared to pass it unamended. The intensifying political battle over the integrity commission comes as the department of finance confirmed it had not briefed the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, or any other ministerial office about the details of a claim involving the former Liberal party staffer, Rachelle Miller. The Morrison government has been battling controversy this week over its stance on the integrity commission, and separately, its refusal to provide details about what was expected to be a payout to Miller of more than $500,000. On Thursday, Miller challenged the prime minister to publicly release details of the settlement payment she would receive after alleging harassment and bullying while working for senior ministers. The finance department said in a statement to Guardian Australia it had handled Miller’s claim at “arms-length from the government”. The statement said officials did not intend to comment on the details of any individual claim. “Notwithstanding Ms Miller’s release of correspondence, the Department of Finance continues to manage Ms Miller’s claim, which has not been finalised, and does not intend to provide any further public comment on this matter”. Miller worked previously for Alan Tudge and Michaelia Cash. Controversy over the government’s stance on the integrity commission, meanwhile, erupted in the middle of the week. Morrison pledged before the 2019 election to legislate a federal integrity body in the parliamentary term that has just ended. The prime minister broke that promise, failing to introduce his own proposal before the 46th parliament was prorogued. On the hustings on Wednesday, Morrison was asked – given his previous undertaking to create the body – whether he would promise to put his proposal to a vote in the next parliament in the event the Coalition won the 21 May election. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison declined to make that promise. “Our position on this hasn’t changed,” the prime minister said. “Our view has been the same – when the Labor party is prepared to support that legislation in that form, then we will proceed with it.” Retired judges on Friday criticised the Morrison government’s broken promise as a “massive policy failure”, saying the Coalition’s explanation for walking away from the pledge was “spurious”. A number of independents running against Liberals in metropolitan seats have made it clear that establishing a credible national integrity commission will be a key demand in the event any new government – Liberal or Labor – is seeking agreements for confidence and supply. The independent MP for Indi, Helen Haines, who has proposed her own model for an anti-corruption commission, blasted Morrison’s position this week. The crossbench independent said it was “nonsense” for the prime minister to claim that he could not proceed unless Labor agreed with the Coalition’s proposal without seeking any amendments. “It would appear we are in the same void as we were before,” Haines said. While Labor has not produced a fully fleshed out alternative proposal, the opposition favours a model with stronger powers than the Coalition’s integrity body. The Coalition’s preferred model would not hold public hearings during investigations into politicians or public servants. Labor’s proposal is a body that would have the power to investigate allegations of serious and systemic corruption that occurred before or after its establishment and the power to hold public hearings where the commission determines that is in the public interest. Albanese said Morrison had “delayed and obfuscated for over three years – and then this week it became clear he has absolutely no intention of honouring his promise to deliver a national anti-corruption commission at all”. “So the question for Mr Morrison is – why do you fear an anti-corruption commission? What is it you’re afraid they will find?”",News/Australia news,"Anthony Albanese commits to anti-corruption watchdog by end of 2022, if Labor wins election",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/16/anthony-albanese-commits-to-anti-corruption-watchdog-by-end-of-2022-if-labor-wins-election
4/16/2022,"The New South Wales government has sold off $3bn worth of social housing during its decade in power, while failing to meet its own targets for new properties. New figures released through parliament this week show that since it was first elected in 2011, the Coalition has sold off 4,205 social housing properties across the state. The sales have added about $3.5bn to the government’s coffers over the same period. But while the government said all of those funds were used to prove “more, and better” social housing stock, data for new social housing constructions reveal the government has fallen well behind its own targets for new dwellings. In 2016, the Coalition pledged to build 23,000 new social housing dwellings in the next decade as part of its Future Directions housing strategy. It committed to funding new social housing construction through the $22bn Communities Plus program. But eight years on, with more than 50,000 people on the social housing wait list in the state, the Communities Plus program has achieved only 10% of that goal. According to written answers provided by the government, only 2,393 social housing properties were completed under the program between 1 July 2016 and 31 December 2021. Other types of housing have also failed to make a dent in the government’s target. The figures provided by the government show that under the same program only 101 new affordable housing dwellings have been constructed since 2016. The government has spruiked a series of other social housing developments currently in the pipeline, including the Ivanhoe Estate in Macquarie Park in the city’s north-west. It is expected to deliver about 950 social housing and 128 affordable housing properties. Similarly long-mooted plans to redevelop the Waterloo South public housing estates will see about 847 social housing properties constructed – about 100 more than are currently on the site – as well as 227 affordable housing dwellings. The government said it had increased the number of “social homes” across the state by 10% since it came to power, though much of that stock is managed by community housing providers. It also conceded that because projects funded under Communities Plus “require major redevelopments and extensive relocations and, as such, are particularly complex” the construction of developments such as Waterloo were “taking some years to complete”. But a spokesperson from the Department of Planning said that some 7,282 “new social homes” had been delivered under the program as of June last year. “LAHC delivered or committed 545 affordable dwellings by last financial year – already above the Future Directions 2026 target of 500,” the spokesperson said. “The Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ), as of 28 February 2022 had also funded 2,921 new social and affordable homes across NSW through the Social and Affordable Housing Fund. “LAHC’s strategic asset recycling program identifies ageing housing that’s sold to fund the supply of more, new, fit-for-purpose social housing. Every dollar generated from a property sale goes back to LAHC to deliver more, and better, social housing for people in need.” But the government has faced criticism for failing to require a larger share of overall social housing in both of those projects. Because the government requires the Land and Housing Corporation – the body responsible for managing social housing – to be “predominately self-funded”, its major social housing redevelopments funded under Communities Plus employ a 70:30 mix of private and public housing. This week, the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, blasted what she called the “tragedy” of failing to secure more social housing in the Waterloo estate in the midst of the state’s housing crisis. “We’ve got a housing crisis in Sydney, and if we can’t have social housing on publicly owned sites, where are we going to have it?” Moore said. Labor’s shadow housing minister, Rose Jackson, has also criticised the government’s argument that social housing sales are redirected into new construction, saying that claim had been “completely debunked” by the failure to meet its own social housing targets. “This isn’t about delivering new housing, this is about selling off valuable government assets to make money for the budget bottom line,” she said. “The figure topping $3bn for the first time shows there is no slowing down the NSW government public housing privatisation agenda.” She said it was “appalling” the government had continued to sell off its social housing during the housing crisis.",News/Australia news,More than $3bn of social housing sold by NSW government since Coalition took power,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/16/more-than-3bn-of-social-housing-sold-by-nsw-government-since-coalition-took-power
4/16/2022,"Recently, my psychologist asked me to consider her assertion that “there is no true altruism” – in other words, no one is truly selfless. All of us are acting in our own interest no matter whether one has dedicated themselves to causes of equality, social justice and solidarity. My psychologist suggests, as many have, that a sense of living for something greater than oneself has significant mental health benefits and the recognition, respect and influence that comes from peers and society from serving others is – in fact – self-serving. It’s a paradox that the cost of utilising your power and privilege in support or standing with those with less – both against attacks from the ideological police on your own side and those who profit from the systems and structures you’re fighting to bring down – buys significant benefits for your own wellbeing and status. The story of Jesus that is central to the Christian celebration of Easter is interesting to consider in light of this concept. One with ultimate power and privilege – Jesus, called the Christ, spends his adult life serving the excluded, oppressed and marginalised people of his society, challenging the corrupt political and religious hierarchies that entrench inequality, poverty and exploitation, and then sacrifices his life through crucifixion at the hands of those authorities, only to rise from the dead to be worshipped as the glorified son of God and saviour of the world. Does the “no true altruism” analysis mean that this is then the ultimate act of self-interest? All the lateral and oppositional violence is worth it if you end up with your name in lights, crowned in eternal glory? Some iterations of the Christian religion – like the “prosperity doctrine” that teaches adherents that giving both financially and in “selfless” service to the church and community will lead to wealth on Earth followed by riches in heaven – suggest so. There is, perhaps, a deeper reading. Wellbeing is found in a sense of purpose; in being truly seen by others and validated as having worth to others and a community of people. It’s found in having the opportunity to be fully welcomed and accepted for who you are. Our society and the messages it communicates about what is celebrated and rejected impacts on our understanding of our self-worth; our families, religious institutions and the communities likewise communicate validation or rejection based on whether our lives meet their various expectations and standards. If we learn that power, wealth, status, body image or living according to social or religious norms are the measures of success as a human then the absence of those assaults our sense of self. If our agency to achieve those things is reduced due to systemic social and economic exclusion – patriarchy, racism, structurally maintained poverty, homophobia, transphobia and ableism – is exacerbated. Granted, we are all pursuing our own wellbeing. It is more important, then, to ask ourselves and others – those who have the ability to make choices about the communities and societies they live in – how their pursuit of wellbeing will impact others. If their path to self-worth is paved by the accumulation of wealth while exploiting workers and environment; if their sense of importance is built on denigrating and excluding those who they see as different or “less than” themselves, or if they are willing to sacrifice the collective good of humanity or the communities that comprise it then we should reject their vision of the future and their leadership outright. To put it more plainly – if your strategy for political victory is turning voters against their neighbour, if you see spending on universal quality child care, public education, mental health or raising the rate of income support for people without jobs as a burden rather than an investment, or if low wages and growing inequality are built in to your policy design and intrinsic to your political ideology then your driving purpose is not the wellbeing of the human collective. Your leadership will not make the well-being of most people better most of the time – because, simply, that is not what you are about. At the centre of every major world religion is a concept similar to the example of Jesus – that is, true life is found in living for others, or, “love others as yourself”. This is not a denial of the concept that we all have an intrinsic need to find security, wellbeing and acceptance for our individual selves – but rather that we’re all better off when anyone finds this through solidarity, generosity, inclusion and the pursuit of equality than through individualism, greed, exclusion and the use of coercive power. This concept should be at the heart of religious communities that follow the example of Jesus – that true “prosperity” is an end to economic, social, political and religious structures that enable one group of people to exploit others for their own power and profit; an end to the idea that one group of people are more worthy of inclusion in faith communities or society that gives them an advantage for personal, social and economic advancement – and at the heart of our decision making about who controls the levers of power that impact on all of us. “True altruism” may be impossible to find. But leaders whose driving purpose and individual wellbeing is centred in the pursuit of solidarity, inclusion, equity and the common good are those we should celebrate, support – and vote for when we have the chance.

4/16/2022,"Campbell Newman’s face is hard to miss. The most conspicuous figure in Queensland politics in a generation – the Liberal National party’s only state premier in more than 25 years – is, as the billboards say, back. The message to commuters who recognise his mug is simple: “New party, same man.” I genuinely don’t know if this is a positive or negative billboard. pic.twitter.com/fKvjPRxib6 The problem for Newman, who is running for the Senate for the Liberal Democrats, is the crowded field of fellow Liberal National party defectors and their various minor parties, mostly vying for the same block of disaffected rightwing voters. “It’s fascinating, this fragmentation or splintering of the LNP,” says Anne Tiernan, a professor of public policy at Griffith University. “It introduces a dynamic we haven’t really considered before, and a range of complexities and unknowns to the [Queensland Senate] election.” The newest entrant to the increasingly crowded field of restless former Liberal Nationals to the Senate race is George Christensen, the darling of the conspiratorial fringe. Christensen will take an unwinnable, but still influential, place on the One Nation ticket behind the party’s founder, Pauline Hanson. Hanson herself shot to prominence after being disendorsed by the Liberals in 1996. Then there’s mining billionaire Clive Palmer, an LNP life member, whose falling out with Newman in 2012 prompted the formation of his big-spending United Australia party. And up north, there’s Katter’s Australia party, yet to announce a Senate candidate, but still very much centred on the personality of Kennedy MP Bob Katter, a former National party state minister turned minor party leader. The contest is further complicated by the structure of the LNP’s ticket and the ever-slimming re-election chances of Amanda Stoker, the assistant minister for women, and a figurehead of the Christian right in Queensland. At best, Stoker is competing with these defectors for two Senate seats. But more realistically, as these parties chase the support of rightwing voters and those still seething about past Covid restrictions, there will likely only be room for one of them in the 47th parliament. The common wisdom is that the Liberal National party and Labor will each win two of six seats at the half-Senate election. That means the likely return of senators James McGrath, Matt Canavan, Murray Watt and Anthony Chisholm. At the 2019 election, Labor’s primary vote in Queensland dropped to 22.5% for the upper house – meaning the party only won a single seat, while gifting the LNP a third seat. Opinion polling suggests that scenario is unlikely to be repeated this time around. The Greens are running Penny Allman-Payne, a teacher from Gladstone. Tiernan says the crowded contest on the right could play into the hands of the Greens, whose support in Queensland has increased steadily in recent years. “The unintended consequence of [the crowd of rightwing candidates] running could be to seriously galvanise and mobilise the more progressive vote, including strategic voting in the Senate. “It wouldn’t take the Greens much to whip up some of that sentiment. People may be prepared to park their vote with the Greens to stop one of those last places inadvertently going to someone on that extreme end.” One of the more interesting elements of this race is how broadly unpopular some of the most competitive candidates are. Labor strategists say Hanson’s “unfavourables” – the number of people who disapprove of her and her policies – are extremely high. Her political longevity has been built by cultivating enough vehement support across Queensland to put her in the Senate mix. The same can be said about Palmer – whose $60m advertising spend at the last federal election garnered zero seats and 3.43% of the national vote – and Newman, the Icarus premier who won Australia’s largest-ever majority in 2012 and lost office three years later. Another eight years on, Newman is still a constant of Labor’s state campaigning. Successive LNP opposition leaders have found themselves tarred by association, then forced to distance themselves, turning Newman into a pantomime villain. “But being a pantomime villain hasn’t harmed Hanson’s political career,” pollster Graham Young, from the libertarian thinktank the Australian Institute of Progress, told the Guardian last year. “When you’re running for premier, you’re running for 50% plus one; when you’re running for the Senate, you’re running for a quota. I know people who are going to vote for [Newman] who would be stalwarts of the Liberal party.” The fragmentation of the LNP on its fringes was put into fresh focus this week by the defection of Christensen, who had increasingly embraced anti-vaccine and anti-government conspiracy theories while he remained a member of the government. At a conservative lobby group’s Christmas party last year, Christensen said he believed the LNP grassroots had become disconnected from elected representatives, adding: “I don’t know exactly how to fix that problem, but I know the only way that it can be fixed is to stay involved.” The subtext was that, for those who wanted the LNP to move further right, it needed warriors for the cause to fight internal battles. One of the great ironies of his move to One Nation is that it poses the greatest risk to Stoker, who herself has shared ultraconservative Christian views. One of Stoker’s supporters said he thought Christensen’s defection “doesn’t change anything other than his bank account or our national debt”. Other party figures are more cautious about the potential impact the defection might have – and whether it could act as a signal to wavering voters on the right fringe. “What’s clear is there’s a lot of pressure on conservative voters to support minor parties,” said one LNP figure. “We don’t really know what impact that will have, but in that environment Stoker’s chances are fading by the day.” Hanson had been considered vulnerable in 2022; the increased competition comes piled on top of a poor Queensland election result in 2020 and suggestions her party may not have the campaigning budget to match Newman’s fundraising network or Palmer’s personal bank account. In that environment, the final Senate seat – and the extent to which minor party candidates would bastardise the voting power of the far right – had been anyone’s guess. “Bolstering Hanson’s prospects in that tight race could be quite an important motivation [for the recruitment of Christensen],” Tiernan says. Tiernan says it will be interesting to see how the situation shapes the LNP campaign in Queensland and how it manoeuvres to keep voters, who might be inclined to support one of these minor parties, inside the tent. She says criticisms of Christensen as a traitor and an opportunist – including by Canavan and another former Nationals colleague, David Littleproud – show the extent to which they feel his defection is a threat to a state party undergoing an identity crisis since the merger of the Liberals and Nationals in 2008. Christensen himself said this week that he had once believed he should fight for conservative values from the inside. “I have been a believer of that line for a long, long while. “But a lot has changed over the last few years.

4/16/2022,"Travellers visiting friends and family for the Easter long weekend could be left without their luggage for days as airlines and airports continue to struggle with staff shortages. The busy holiday travel period combined with Covid isolation orders and a workforce cut and outsourced during the pandemic has resulted in chaotic scenes at airports across Australia, and many passengers arriving at their destinations without their luggage. Been in qld 30 hours. No idea where my bag is, and neither do @Qantas . Meanwhile, their CEO has earned $6507.85 since the plane landed. At Brisbane Airport waiting to pick up family. An announcement just told an entire flight from Melbourne not a single piece of luggage was loaded. All their bags will now arrive “in the coming days”. Happy Easter! Guardian Australia reported on Thursday that some planes were only being half loaded with checked luggage to ensure flights were not significantly delayed, with passengers told to expect their luggage in the coming days. “Decisions were made to have these flights depart without baggage to ensure that customers could get to their destination and not face long flight delays or cancellations,” a Qantas spokesperson said on Friday. The bags would be put on later flights and then sent to customers by courier. “We really appreciate people’s patience and understanding and apologise for the inconvenience,” the spokesperson said. My sister was on QF616 from Melbourne to Brisbane yesterday. Entire flight had no bags. They have not been couriered. She still has no bag and has not been contacted about when she can get it and can’t get through to Qantas. So that’s blatantly incorrect. Despite warnings from airlines and airports to get in early, long queues at check-in counters were reported again on Friday as more travellers set off on their long weekends. Customers had been warned to arrive three hours ahead of their flights as airports around the country expected to remain busy over the Easter and school holiday period. “Queues expected to ease towards midday and peak again into the afternoon,” Sydney Airport tweeted on Friday.

Spent $925 yesterday on replacing things as couldn’t wait any longer It is the second week in a row of airport delays, with the Easter long weekend adding to the delays experienced during the first week of school holidays. Michael Kaine, the national secretary of the Transport Workers’ Union, held a press conference with outsourced Qantas workers at Sydney airport on Thursday and linked the decision to outsource 2,000 baggage handling roles with the “catastrophic scenes” at airports. “Those 2,000 workers are ready, willing and able to come back to work but Qantas is not putting them back on, and now we’re seeing this panicked response,” Kaine told ABC. A Qantas spokesperson told Guardian Australia: “We reject the union’s claims that these disruptions are linked to the decision 18 months ago to outsource our ground handling at airports.” The spokesperson said between 20% and 50% of employees in some areas have been unable to work due to Covid-related staff shortages, and noted these issues were “happening across many areas of the aviation industry including in other airlines, in airport security screening and in other countries”. A Qantas spokesperson said Good Friday had been busy for the airline but travellers had heeded the message to arrive early. More than 200 head office managers volunteered to help out over the long weekend to ease the pressure. Sydney airport had forecast 79,000 passengers would pass through the airport on Friday, with 56,000, 62,000 and 72,000 predicted for the remainder of the long weekend. Geoff Culbert, Sydney airport’s chief executive, said the airport was “pulling every lever available” to ease the issues, including having senior staff working in the terminal to manage queues, but travellers have been urged to arrive two hours prior to their flight departure time. Monday is expected to be Hobart’s busiest-ever day for flights, with more than 81 planes coming and going. Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide airports have all reported passenger numbers not seen since prior to the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Additional security screening lanes were opened at Sydney’s Qantas domestic terminal on Good Friday, and Jetstar has begun using larger Boeing 787 Dreamliners for its Melbourne to Cairns and the Gold Coast routes. These planes are usually reserved for international flights. With the relaxing of coronavirus restrictions, Australians were set to spend $7.1bn this holiday season, according to research conducted by Roy Morgan.

4/16/2022,"Alie Benge, a writer, and David Coffey, a mental health worker, were browsing apartment listings in Barcelona and dreaming of a getaway when it hit them. The couple, both 33, had been planning an overseas trip for some time. When they looked at long term accommodation, they realised it was more affordable than what they were paying for shared flats in Wellington – a city with a reputation for chilly, ageing housing stock and soaring rents. “We were looking at places to stay on Airbnb – this is in Barcelona – and it’s cheaper than what I would pay here in Wellington,” David says. If they were paying so much, why not do so in one of the world’s biggest cities? “The cost of living here is horrific,” he says. “It gets to the point of, if you’re flushing money down the toilet … do you want to do that somewhere you’ve spent your entire life? Or do you want to go try something else, experience something else?” “Yeah,” Alie chimes in. “If we’re going to be paying a fortune for living costs, we might as well be doing that in London.” New Zealand has been an enviable haven through the heights of the coronavirus pandemic. Tens of thousands of residents flocked home in the first year of the outbreak – and many more wished to, but were locked out by tough border restrictions. In 2020, the country reported its largest net gain of citizens since the 1970s. Now, those fortunes are changing, with tens of thousands poised to leave. Government documents from this week estimated that 50,000 would leave over the next year, but the number could swell to 125,000 if the stacked-up young people who had delayed post-graduation trips left too. Each member of the exodus has their own reasons. Some, feeling burned out by the claustrophobia of pandemic life, are simply itching to try something new. A switch to remote work has freed some up to live offshore. Others are young graduates taking long-delayed “overseas experience” trips – a rite of passage for many middle class New Zealanders. But almost all of those who spoke to the Guardian said as well as the tug of big cities and new experiences, they were also being pushed by challenging circumstances at home: rising living costs, inflation, stagnant wages and an unaffordable housing market. “I’m at this point where I would love to have housing stability and that’s just not a possibility for me here,” says Rebecca, 39, a marketing worker in Auckland. She’s weighing a move to Melbourne, where she has a number of friends and wages are higher. House prices rose more than 27% last year, and hit an average of $1m, far beyond reach of many New Zealanders. “As a single person it’s impossible to buy,” Rebecca says. “It just kind of feels like I’m not really getting anywhere, to be honest.” “Through the pandemic and everything I was looking to buy a house and saving to buy a house – and that’s gotten harder and harder and also more depressing,” says David Coffey. While the market’s runaway growth is now slowing, rising interest rates mean some buyers are growing squeamish at the thought of unmanageable mortgage repayments. The country is also in the grip of a sharply rising cost of living: in March, food prices were up 7.6% from last year, with fruit and vegetable prices up 18%. For some residents, those are enough to tip them over into seeking greener pastures – and higher wages – in London or Australia. “I bought a lettuce the other day, and it was $6,” Rebecca says. “I’m sure it’s, you know, hydroponically grown, but it just feels like everything is getting harder and harder, and tighter.” Her sense of gloom is shared by many New Zealanders: according to polling in March, economic optimism was slipping: just 28% were optimistic about the economy and 53% pessimistic. Elle, a 30-year-old designer in Wellington, is moving to England with her partner next year. “The industry is very small in New Zealand, for designers. You can’t buy a house here. Job options are pretty limited, even in a city. It’s kind of like: where do you go for more?” For many, the easiest leap is to Australia, which doesn’t require work visas for New Zealanders and is by far the largest recipient of Aotearoa’s émigrés. Amy*, 42, is an events manager and single parent living in the South Island. She’s planning a move to Australia or the Pacific, where she says she can almost double her salary in the events or hotel management sector. As her son’s sole provider, she says, “I would quite like to earn more money, which is just not going to happen in the industry that I work in New Zealand. The main reason to go is so that I can just give my son better opportunities. “The timing for me is a combination of things. It’s not just the cost of living that’s forcing me to think about doing this – it’s [also] that I want to give my child some other experiences, and I’m at a point in my life where I want to be earning more money. If that means that we head off somewhere else, that’s what we’ll do.” “It’s not surprising to me that there’s an expectation of a return to the emigration of New Zealand citizens,” says Prof Francis Collins, director of the Te Ngira Institute for Population Research at the University of Waikato. “That continues a pattern that has been established for several decades, and has been particularly sharp in periods where either there are economic recessions, or where there are issues around inequality of opportunity.” New Zealand already has a startlingly high portion of its population living overseas – up to 1 million, or 20% of the resident population, the third highest in the OECD. In the past, Collins said, high emigration tended to happen during high unemployment. Now, however, unemployment is at just 3.2% – and a net loss could lead to shortages of skills in specialised areas. That could create challenges for the Ardern government, which earlier in its term was focused on an “immigration reset” to restrict “low skill” labour and ease pressures on housing or infrastructure. “When our borders fully open again, we can’t afford to simply turn on the tap,” minister Stuart Nash said in a May 2021 speech. “The pressure we have seen on housing and infrastructure in recent years means we need to get ahead of population growth.” Now, the government may face problems from the opposite direction – some sectors are already complaining of skills shortages from a lack of labour. Earlier in the month, Kiwibank projected net 20,000 migration losses, which the bank warned would hit economic growth. “It is concerning because we’re losing people from a tight labour market already,” Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr said. “We think it’s a big issue.” While economic factors are motivating many New Zealanders, some say they’re also simply feeling ready for change. Aotearoa’s isolation was an enormous advantage in pandemic management. But after two years of closed borders, disrupted supply chains and intermittent lockdowns, some are keenly feeling that isolation, and craving connection with the rest of the world. “I think there’s almost a kind of existential loneliness,” says Alie. “Not just [that] we’re all kind of lonely because we’ve been stuck in our homes, but also New Zealand has never felt smaller or further away from the rest of the world.” And, while most are planning to leave for at least the medium term, to spend several years overseas, they also believe they’ll one day be back. If absence does make the heart grow fonder, New Zealanders have had very little opportunity to be absent in the last two years. “When we decided we wanted to travel, I remember sitting there and thinking – I’d like to feel homesick,” David says. “It might sound weird. But I want to be at a distance, and appreciate New Zealand again.”",News/World news,"As New Zealand emerges from pandemic isolation, citizens queue up to leave",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/as-new-zealand-emerges-from-pandemic-isolation-citizens-queue-up-to-leave
4/16/2022,"Among the 40 federal treasurers Australia has had since 1901, there is an outstanding similarity: not one is a woman. About the same can be said for the leadership of other top economic bodies; the Productivity Commission, Asic, and Apra have never been led by women. Nor, in its 60 years, has a woman ever been governor of the Reserve Bank. These positions that impact the economy of the country, and the lives of its 25 million citizens, have never been filled by a female. The pipeline to these positions of power, and to top business and government boardrooms across the country, often involves the study of economics. But while there has been a push in recent years to get women studying in traditionally male-dominated Stem fields, the proportion of women studying economics has been in decline. New data and analysis from the Reserve Bank of Australia may have identified one of the roadblocks; female high school students believe they are worse at economics than they actually are. A pool of evidence on the “gender confidence gap” – the tendency of women to underestimate their intelligence compared to men’s self-estimation – already exists. This new research suggests, however, that this lower self-perceived ability may deter female students from pursuing economics beyond high school. And the impact of that falls not only on students, but also on the potential economic outcomes of the nation. “We are talking about the people who really hold the reins of power in Australia,” says Cherelle Murphy, EY’s Oceania chief economist. “If we don’t get female economists into the profession now, we are going to be facing another generation of leadership where there are too few females.” The RBA study asked 2,000 year 11 and 12 students across Australia to rank their understanding of economics on a scale of one to five. This found their self-perceived proficiency, which was tested against their real proficiency based on performance in a test of economic concepts. The results revealed “quite a striking contrast” between girls and boys, according to the RBA’s head of information, Jacqui Dwyer. Compared to almost half of male students surveyed, only 30% of female students reported a good understanding of concepts. Meanwhile, 35% of girls said they had only a poor understanding of concepts but only 20% of boys did the same. The study also found that students from lower socioeconomic postcodes rated themselves less proficient than their wealthier peers. But unlike students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds – whose self-perceived ability matched their actual ability – girls’ confidence was lower than their ability. Over the course of a generation, high school enrolment in economics has fallen by 70%. That fall has been most pronounced among female students, with RBA data suggesting a 78% decline in girls enrolling since 1992. There are now two boys to each girl studying economics at a school level in Australia. And at university, male students are again more likely to enrol, with numbers of female enrolments dwindling over recent decades. Today, women make up only 37% of economics students. Dr Leonora Risse, a senior lecturer in economics at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, says “the profession is at fault”. “The traditional way of teaching economics is theoretical, bland and disconnected from real-world problems like climate change and inequality,” Risse says. When teachers assert the subject as “just hard equations” and traditional male voices dominate classrooms, she says it becomes daunting and exclusionary. At 15 years old, Skye Dannaher was “reading everything, from Adam Smith to Marx to Piketty to Krugman.” “It took up pretty much all of my spare time, I was absolutely obsessed.” Dannaher, now 19, hoped to complete a PHD and work in economics research. “The way people interact with resources, how they distribute among themselves and build on them to create new things … I find it absolutely fascinating.” But their high school study of economics set those goals askew. “Being trans, I noticed an almost immediate shift in how I was perceived and my input in class” they say. Going from an all-boys school to studying as a female student at a co-ed school, Dannaher also perceived an instant subconscious devaluing of their own opinion, internalising the way they felt perceived by others. “In class, I would say something, and boys would say the same thing hours or days later, and they would get a warmer reception to having the same idea.” Ultimately, Dannaher felt “always underestimated”. “It all sort of made me temper my expectations of how I would be able to do studying economics at university,” they say. Dannaher now studies philosophy and history. The confidence gap, says Risse, is “a response to signals around us and the environment we are in”. In the US, an analysis of economic textbooks found that women were generally referenced in roles such as shopping or doing household chores, while men were overrepresented in positions of authority. Across her own teaching, Risse has observed the same in Australia. “Textbooks are meant to use real-world scenarios to illustrate economics in action,” Risse says. “They are evoking those traditional stereotypes within their pages.” Dawson says, within this culture problem, “you can’t be what you can’t see”. In Australia, just 15% of economics professors are women, for example. Women also make up only 18% of CEOs and 15% of board chairs. The RBA study found that the confidence gap for girls exposed to a female teacher was markedly reduced. Dr Rigissa Megalokonomou, a senior lecturer in the University of Queensland School of Economics, points to US research which found that girls exposed to “successful and charismatic women” who majored in economics are almost twice as likely to major in economics themselves. “With female role models, not only do girls perform better, but also have more confidence about their skills.” Risse says, though a girl “might love and be good at economics,” these environmental factors “subconsciously add up” to make women “doubt or question their legitimacy to be in the field”. “Many men that dominate our economic conversations are too confident they are right,” Emma Dawson, the executive director at Per Capita, says. “The system reflects the way they live in the world, and is set up to serve their interests.” Dawson points to an array of structural deficiencies that exist “often because men don’t necessarily see the issue”. Childcare, for example, is traditionally seen as a cost rather than an investment despite the returns the economy receives by spending on childcare. Then there is superannuation. The current average payout for women is a third of the payout for men, quantified by the Australian Human Rights Commission as just $37,000 compared with $110,000. Getting women into higher paying jobs earlier, supporting maternity leave super, and ensuring it is paid on every dollar so part time workers don’t miss out, are “all structural changes” Dawson says are needed to improve outcomes for women. While we fail to account for the female experience, Dawson says women will continue to be more likely to “accumulate poverty over a lifetime”. But the absence of female economists likely has consequences beyond ‘women’s issues’. Megalokonomou says “female economists bring a different perspective on different topics when included in the discussion”. Her research has observed a general trend of women economists being more likely to support government intervention, environmental regulation, and be concerned about issues of equality, for instance. The RBA survey also found female students are typically more interested in identifying problems to be solved, and in issues like globalisation and the environment, whereas male students tend to be more interested in topics such as the share market and production decisions. “Male and female students in high school have different questions they want to answer,” Dwyer explains. “And when girls don’t recognise these topics as in fact part of the field of economics, they don’t recognise that economics is for them.” The result, Megalokonomou says, is the “pattern of misrepresentation extending from schools to universities to business and government boards,” losing innovative perspectives across all economic discourse. “Those who study economics shape the discipline and make economic policies,” Dwyer says. “The more we can diversify the people that advise businesses, governments, and provide commentary … the more we will see a willingness to challenge orthodoxy.” Without that diversity in the profession, “we don’t have different perspectives on the sort of economic questions that are asked,” Dwyer says. “Nor do we have different perspectives on how these questions are answered.”",News/Society,Underestimated: why young women are shying away from economics,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/16/underestimated-why-young-women-are-shying-away-from-economics
4/16/2022,"Almost seven years after Victoria’s Labor government scrapped a billion-dollar contract to construct the East West Link, the project – once dubbed a “zombie” by the state’s treasurer – refuses to die. The federal Coalition has previously pushed the case for the project. But this time, it was the state opposition reviving it by announcing it would build the underground tunnel to connect Melbourne’s Eastern Freeway to CityLink if was elected at the November election. The opposition spokesperson for transport infrastructure, Matthew Bach, said the Coalition would continue to advocate for the toll road, despite voters rejecting it at two state elections. “I represent a large constituency in the eastern region, I talk to people in my area all the time about this road, who are fed up. They’ve been fed up for years, sitting in traffic on the Eastern Freeway,” he told reporters on Friday. In the scheme of East West Link announcements, it was a subdued affair. Neither the party’s state leader, Matthew Guy, or prime minister Scott Morrison – who was in Melbourne at the time – attended the event. The 2014 state election was dubbed a “referendum on the East West Link” by then prime minister Tony Abbott. The premier at the time, Denis Napthine, had vowed to build it while then-opposition leader Daniel Andrews promised to cancel the contract, describing it as “not worth the paper it’s written on”. If the election was indeed a referendum on the project, voters responded with a resounding no. Andrews won, making the Coalition the first single-term government in Victoria since 1955, and the contract was cancelled. In 2018, Guy gave new life to the project, proposing a modified route to minimise property acquisitions if elected. The Coalition went on to suffer a humiliating defeat with huge swings against the party, including in the eastern suburbs, where many drivers would have benefited from the East West Link. It’s not to say the East West Link cost the Coalition the election – an internal review found the ousting of Malcolm Turnbull as the federal party’s leader had a major impact, as did the party’s law-and-order-led strategy. But it was expected the proposal would be confined to the history books, given Andrews would be forging ahead with the North East Link, connecting the Eastern Freeway and the M80 Ring Road at Greensborough. Less than six months later and a week before the 2019 federal election, Morrison committed $4bn for the East West Link as part of his bid to retain seats in the eastern suburbs. The same suburbs that turned red in 2018 ended up sticking with the Liberals in 2019. The money remains in the federal budget, handed down last month, as a “contingency”, to be given to the first Victorian government prepared to deliver the project. Bach said the state could “immediately begin” construction using the funds. “Who doesn’t take $4bn to build a road?” he said. The announcement also works to counter the Victorian government’s argument that the state has been shafted by their federal counterparts when it comes to infrastructure funding. Earlier this week, Victoria’s transport infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, gave Barnaby Joyce a spray at their first meeting since the Nationals leader took over the portfolio at a federal level, telling him “Victorians are Australian taxpayers as well”. She said 6% – or $208m – of the $3.56bn in new infrastructure funding promised by the Morrison government is allocated to Victoria. Andrews on Friday said his government would forge ahead with the infrastructure that Victorians voted for. “I’m not here to be committing to projects that don’t stack up and committing to projects that Victorians have voted against,” he said. “With the East West Link, you lose money for every dollar you spend.” Indeed, the business case for the East West Link, put together in March 2013, found that for every $1 invested only 45 cents would be returned. An updated business case three months later showed a return of 80 cents. When wider economic benefits were factored in, the benefit cost ratio was $1.40. A 2015 report by the auditor general found abandoning the project was expected to cost more than $1.1bn but if the East West Link had proceeded to completion, the project would have cost in excess of $22.8bn. Meanwhile, Infrastructure Victoria’s latest strategy, released last year, found there was no “immediate need” for the East West Link due to other major projects being built. The advisory body suggested preserving the East West Link corridor for it to be delivered “if circumstances require”. It’s hard to see how churning out the same policy three elections in a row, with almost no changes, will help the Victorian Coalition win any extra votes. If anything, it makes them look like they aren’t listening to Victorians. But it might get their federal counterparts talking.",News/Australia news,Another election year leads to another Victorian debate about the East West Link proposal,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/16/another-election-year-leads-to-another-victorian-debate-about-the-east-west-link-proposal
4/16/2022,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Luke Harding travelled to Bucha and spoke to one resident who recounted the murder of her nephew, one of the casualties of the carnage wrought by Russian forces. Natasha Alexandrova was at home when three Russian soldiers banged on her front gate. It was 4 March. Vladimir Putin’s army had captured the city of Bucha, 18.5 miles (30km) north-west of Kyiv, after ferocious fighting. One unit parked itself at the bottom of Alexandrova’s street. She lived with her 26-year-old nephew, Volodymyr Cherednichenko, and his mother. The soldiers shoved Cherednichenko into their armoured personnel carrier. His mother brought him a warm coat and shoes. “They told us they were taking him into town for further interrogation and would bring him back after three days.” His body was found weeks later in a dank garden cellar. “They made him kneel and shot him in the side of the head, through the ear,” Alexandrova said. “He was wearing the same coat his mother gave him.” Martin Chulov examined Vladimir Putin’s appointment of a new general to lead efforts to reboot the invasion of Ukraine. Gen Aleksandr Dvornikov played a prominent role in the Syrian war, where forces under his command were responsible for widespread abuses against the civilian population and were frequently accused of committing crimes against humanity. Russia’s Syrian campaign was viewed by Putin as a success, and he awarded Dvornikov the hero of Russia medal, one of the country’s highest awards. Dvornikov, who has served as commander of the southern military district since 2016, faces a very different set of challenges in Ukraine, where the Russian air force does not control the skies and its ground forces have been seriously depleted by regular supplies of advanced weaponry that was unavailable to Syrian rebels. Russia is receiving munitions and military hardware sourced from Iraq for its war effort in Ukraine with the help of Iranian weapons smuggling networks, according to members of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and regional intelligence services with knowledge of the process, write Bethan McKernan and Vera Mironova. RPGs and anti-tank missiles, as well as Brazilian-designed rocket launcher systems, have been dispatched to Russia from Iraq as Moscow’s campaign has faltered in the last month, the Guardian has learned. An Iranian-made Bavar 373 missile system, similar to the Russian S-300, has also been donated to Moscow by the authorities in Tehran, who also returned an S-300, according to a source who helped organise the transport. Using the weapons-trafficking underworld would signal a dramatic shift in Russian strategy, as Moscow is forced to lean on Iran, its military ally in Syria, after new sanctions triggered by the invasion of Ukraine. The developments also have huge implications for the direction and volume of trade in the international weapons trafficking business. Bethan McKernan also wrote about the Ukrainians who narrowly escaped a missile attack and were left with devastating injuries. The evacuation train that was supposed to arrive in the Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk last Friday was late. Andrei Kovalov was standing on the busy platform waiting for the service that would take him west, far away from the fighting, which is on the verge of engulfing his home town of Bakhmut in Donetsk. The 45-year-old was among up to 4,000 other civilians at the train station that morning fleeing the advance of Russian troops across the country’s east. The war managed to find them anyway. Before the train to Dnipro pulled in, two ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station building, dropping deadly cluster munitions – illegal under international law because of the indiscriminate damage they cause over a wide area – all over the concourse and baggage hall. “I remember it very clearly. I thought I could hear a plane, and then I was thrown on the floor,” Kovalov said from his hospital bed in the Dnipropetrovsk region. “The first minute was total chaos. The emergency response tents caught fire, cars caught fire. There was blood and smoke everywhere.” In the hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, a longtime QAnon follower tweeted that approximately 30 US-funded ‘biolabs’ were dotted across Ukraine. Putin’s assault on Ukraine, he theorised, was really about stopping an American-orchestrated biological attack on Russia. He was just remixing an allegation Moscow had made for years: that the US was running a secret bioweapons programme and had Russia in its sights. But from that single tweet, the conspiracy theory quickly spread. Even before Fox News’s Tucker Carlson amplified the theory, the Canadian journalist Justin Ling had been watching it spread across the internet. He told Michael Safi that watching it gain momentum, he could see Russia’s techniques for amplifying disinformation in action.

As Shaun Walker and Andrew Roth write, a few days later she ventured into the village school, where she works as the deputy headteacher, and discovered the Russians had taken most of the computers, the projectors and other electronic equipment. “People saw them simply loading everything on to Ural trucks, everything they could get their hands on,” said Samson. A dozen houses on the village’s main street had been looted, as well as all the shops. Other villagers reported losing washing machines, food, laptops and even a sofa. Dan Sabbagh analysed Russia’s indiscriminate use of weaponry that has led to high numbers of civilian deaths. A Russian tank is filmed firing on apartments in Mariupol; evidence emerges that a cluster bomb was used to strike against the train station in Kramatorsk and concerns surface about the possible use of phosphorus in Ukraine’s cities. Moscow’s forces have been repeatedly accused of using indiscriminate weapons in cities throughout the seven-week-long Ukraine war, a disregard for civilian life that has already almost certainly led to thousands of unnecessary deaths. Concerns too circulate about an escalation of the conflict through the use of other banned weapons – but this is less certain. Britain’s Ministry of Defence is still investigating a report from earlier this week that chemical weapons were used by Russia in Mariupol, affecting three people.

Guardian Australia’s breakdown of pork barrelling commitments made since the start of the year shows that people in the northern Tasmanian seat of Bass have been promised a total of at least $5,493 per voter from the major parties – the highest amount on a per capita basis. The data shows the Coalition has promised $416m in spending for the seat since the beginning of the year, including a large infrastructure package announced in the budget. The figure includes the total of spending promises made by Labor and the Coalition that specifically target the electorate, such as a $15m aquatic centre promised by Labor. It also includes discretionary government spending, such as $336m to upgrade the east and west Tamar highways. The government is desperately fighting to keep Bass, held by Liberal MP Bridget Archer on a 0.4% margin, with Morrison visiting the division three times this year, including twice in the past fortnight. Albanese has made five visits since January, starting his official campaign there on Monday, where he announced a $1.5m health commitment relating to child hearing. Morrison visited Launceston on Thursday to make a $219m announcement for the forestry industry, including a $100m for an Australia-wide national institute for forest products innovation, with a central “hub” in Launceston, along with five others. Voters in the marginal NSW seat of Gilmore are also high up the list for the most pork barrelling, with a total of $3,700 per voter. The Coalition has promised almost $400m in projects to the seat, including the $353m allocated by the government for the Milton Ulladulla bypass in the budget, while Labor’s election commitments so far total about $80m. In a sign of the tense competition in the seat, the Labor candidate for Gilmore, Fiona Phillips, almost immediately matched a $40m road upgrade commitment made by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Liberal candidate Andrew Constance on the opening day of the campaign. Phillips has also pledged $6.5m to upgrade mobile phone black spots around the region, and $7.5m for a new library at Sanctuary Point. The marginal Labor-held seat of Dobell has also been a key focus of the Coalition campaign, with voters in the NSW seat promised $387m from the government as it seeks to flip it – the equivalent of about $3,200 per voter. In the opening week, Morrison has made about $260m in new commitments, while Labor leader Anthony Albanese has announced $190m. Safe Coalition seats in Western Australia have also been strong beneficiaries of government spending, with Durack in particular receiving huge sums towards infrastructure projects announced in the 2022 budget. The electorate, one of the largest in Australia, will also benefit from the Coalition’s increased defence spending with the announcement of a $244m upgrade to the RAAF base near Derby. Voters in the safe seat of Canning in WA have been at the receiving end of about $4,600 per voter as a result of large government road projects promised in the electorate, including upgrades to the Tonkin Highway. Canning is held by the Liberal MP Andrew Hastie on an 11.6% margin. Also in WA, David Goode, the Liberal candidate for the seat of Burt, and Ben Morton, the member for Tangney, announced $40m in federal government funding to upgrade a road intersection in the Perth suburbs. This essentially matches a Labor party promise for $35m for the same project made on 4 April. The Coalition is concerned it could lose several seats in the west given the popularity of the Labor state government, and the poor showing of the state Liberal party at the last election, which has depleted the party’s infrastructure on the ground. The seats in play include Pearce, Swan and Hasluck. Voters in Pearce have been promised about $1,360 per person, compared to $880 in Hasluck and $291 in Swan. In Queensland, the marginal seat of Leichhardt tops the list for the most spending commitments, with about $2,000 on offer per voter. This figure would be far higher if projects of state significance were included, with both leaders announcing significant funding commitments on the reef. In the seat of Flynn, which Labor is chasing as one of the seven seats it needs to form majority government, voters have been promised projects that break down to about $1,000 each. At the other end of the list are electorates such as Wentworth, which has not yet benefited from any election promises or new, discretionary government funds, despite being a marginal Coalition seat at threat from an independent candidate. There are 33 seats that have missed out altogether, with no election promises or spending commitments made by either major party since January. Unsurprisingly, 24 are safe seats, or 73%. Just under half of these (45%) are in NSW, despite NSW having 31% of electorates nationally. Guardian Australia is counting announcements that are either election promises, grants or government funding that we’ve termed “discretionary”. This usually means a government minister is the final decision-maker on the project. We’re discounting any announcements that are reannouncing old money or projects previously announced. Promises that stand to benefit an area wider than a single electorate are also not being counted here.

4/16/2022,"Last month, a courtroom watched a Queensland police officer break down in tears as she recalled meeting a desperate woman, Doreen Langham, in the days before her domestic violence killing. The officer, whose identity was suppressed by the coroner’s court, said she believed police required more training. She would have done things differently. “I wouldn’t have had so much reliance on her presentation to me, her demeanour,” the officer said. “I would have asked more probing questions. Could she provide messages to me? Did she have any further evidence of anything … that she could offer me? Was there any previous history between the two?” The deputy state coroner, Jane Bentley, is simultaneously investigating two separate domestic violence killings – Langham, and the deaths of Hannah Clarke and her three young children. Since the inquest hearings, public discussion has ultimately turned to the adequacy of police training and how it could be improved, particularly to allow frontline officers to better recognise the signs of coercive control. But there is an important subtext to that discussion that cannot be ignored. The idea that better training is a panacea is a convenient argument – one that is pushed most strongly by those who oppose a more serious examination of how police culture contributes to poor responses experienced by women seeking help. It is important to understand the history here. Numerous inquests and hearings over the past decade have seen police commit to reform, to better educate officers and to review policies and procedures. But still these problems keep arising. The inquest into the 2011 killings of Antony Way, Tania Simpson and her daughter Kyla, detailed how a police officer did not consider the killer’s prior controlling behaviour to be domestic violence. The coroner, Michael Barnes, found that “those charged with helping the family stay safe did not have processes that gathered the necessary information, nor the expertise to adequately interpret it”. In 2o15, the inquest into the death of Indigenous woman Elsie Robertson recommended “a review of training packages available to police officers, with a view to assessing the appropriateness and frequency of compulsory professional development opportunities relevant to domestic and family violence”. That same year the landmark Not Now, Not Ever report found that “training and specialised practice materials must be developed and made available to police and judicial officers, as well as frontline service delivery providers”. The Queensland government’s response to the killings of Clarke and her children was to establish a women’s safety taskforce, chaired by the former court of appeal president, Margaret McMurdo. Its first task was to look at criminalising coercive control. In doing so, the taskforce hit a complication. In an environment where police frequently misidentify victims and perpetrators – and where domestic violence cases now represent about 40% of all police jobs – creating a new non-physical offence risked amplifying, not solving, those problematic responses. This is of particular concern for Indigenous women and migrant women. In handing down its report on how to criminalise coercive control, the McMurdo taskforce delivered a key recommendation: that Queensland hold a royal commission to “examine widespread cultural issues within the Queensland Police Service relating to the investigation of domestic and family violence”. “A Queensland woman seeking police help to stay safe from a perpetrator enters a raffle – she may get excellent assistance, or she may be turned away,” the report says. “Unfortunately, the taskforce has … heard that many police officers right across the state are not responding to women’s complaints of domestic violence and this is putting women’s safety at risk.” Guardian Australia has consistently reported on the way police have failed women in Queensland. In particular, we have followed the case of Julie*, whose address was accessed by an officer and leaked to her violent former partner. Dani* privately prosecuted her former partner, who poured petrol on her, when police refused to bring charges. Lyla’s rape statement was placed in a shredder. In pursuing these stories, our reporting has not been “anti-police”. It has been aided and encouraged by many serving and former officers; people who deeply understand the way these issues are shaped by cultural issues within the police service. The Queensland government has yet to announce if it will fully implement the McMurdo report recommendations, which would mean holding a royal commission into police cultures, including examining whether to establish an independent law enforcement conduct commission. Women’s groups, some former senior police officers and respected domestic violence researchers have all supported the need for an inquiry. Senior police officers, and the influential police union, are strongly opposed. The union president, Ian Leavers, called the recommendation and the report “woke”. Leavers told the Clarke inquest last month that police lacked the proper training to deal with domestic violence incidents. More effective police training is clearly needed. But it is not a silver bullet that will immediately reform police responses. Nor is it an excuse for not finally listening to the voices of women, whose experiences have again and again demanded a proper inquiry, not another “patchwork” fix designed not to ruffle too many feathers.",News/Australia news,Better police training isn’t a silver bullet to address Queensland’s domestic violence problem | Ben Smee,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/16/better-police-training-isnt-a-silver-bullet-to-address-queenslands-domestic-violence-problem
4/16/2022,"Cheltenham racecourse said on Friday that it has started formal consultations with owners and trainers over the possibility of adding a fifth day to its big Festival meeting in March. A report in the Racing Post [£] suggests that the Jockey Club, which owns the course, could seek to squeeze even more money from its biggest cash cow from 2024. The Festival expanded from three days to four – Tuesday to Friday – in 2005 and speculation over the possible addition of a fifth afternoon has been a talking point in the meeting’s aftermath for several years. Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood, both Flat racing festivals in the summer months, are currently the only five-day meetings in the British calendar. Until now, however, the course has not conducted any formal consultation with interested parties, or set what appears to be a deadline – of this autumn – for a decision on the move, ahead of a switch to five days in just under two years’ time. The expectation is that two races would be added to the current 28, to create a meeting with six-race cards each day, rather than the current seven. The Racing Post’s report quotes Ian Renton, Cheltenham’s managing director, as suggesting that the track will “get people’s opinions so we can take a much more rational view on how people feel”, that it will “listen to everyone’s views” and that it is “not going to make any decision lightly”. Initially the consultation will include owners and trainers, but it is also likely to expand to the track’s annual members. Whether there will be any attempt to survey non-members who attended the Festival in recent seasons, to assess whether they might feel short-changed by six races in an afternoon rather than seven, is unclear. There will also be a host of practical issues for the course to address before taking any decision, including the running order for major races during a five-day Festival ending on Saturday. The Gold Cup is currently staged on Friday, the final day of the meeting, when it effectively has the British sporting field to itself. On a Saturday it would face stiff competition, both for attention and spectators, from Premier League football and Six Nations rugby. If the Gold Cup stayed in its now-traditional Friday slot, however, the Saturday card could risk becoming an afterthought. Further dilution of the Festival’s competitiveness will also be a concern, not least after a Grade One novice chase at this year’s meeting attracted just four runners, all from Irish stables. The lack of high-margin corporate hospitality business on Saturdays will also need to be factored into the calculations, along with the availability – or otherwise – of the thousands of casual staff required to work in the track’s bars and restaurants. The Cheltenham Festival has become the Jockey Club’s biggest money-spinner over the course of the last 30 years, and some fans will see the formal consultation on a fifth day as being motivated by little more than greed. The extent and sincerity of its “consultation” may be an interesting test of its claim to consider the long-term interests of racing as a whole, and not just its own bottom line. Nothing will dislodge Native Trail from the top of the betting for the 2,000 Guineas after his successful return in Thursday’s Craven Stakes at Newmarket, but two dual Group One-winning juveniles – Angel Bleu and Perfect Power – line up in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury on Saturday and Christophe Soumillon’s arrival to partner Perfect Power is an added attraction. Soumillon rode Perfect Power to victory in the Prix Morny and the Middle Park Stakes last season, the latter race being his first ride in Britain since the Royal meeting in 2019. It was classic Soumillon, as he emerged from behind a wall of horses after dropping in from a poor draw and then fired Richard Fahey’s colt through a gap to win going away. Perfect Power (3.00) has yet to race beyond six furlongs while Angel Bleu, successful in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere and Criterium International last year, is already a Group One winner at a mile. He has plenty of stamina on the dam’s side of his pedigree, however, and the seven-furlong trip should hold no fears. It is a slight surprise to find him chalked up as second-favourite and anything around 9-4 looks well worth taking. Musselburgh 1.32 Nine of the 10 runners are making their seasonal debut, but Desert Angel made a solid return to action in a well-run race at Wolverhampton last month and that might just tip the balance. Newbury 1.50 Raymond Tusk was value for more than his four-length margin at Doncaster last time and has a fitness edge on most of his rivals. Musselburgh 2.04 Track, trip and going look ideal for Gweedore, and Andrew Breslin takes off a useful 3lb too. Newbury 2.25 At the likely odds, Jumbly could be worth in interest to follow up an easy Listed win – in a useful time – in October, not least as her dam, Thistle Bird, improved with age throughout her career. Musselburgh 2.39 Many possibilities in a competitive sprint handicap but Makanah has plenty of form over track and trip, and has gone well fresh in the past.

4/16/2022,"Emma Hayes has said Fran Kirby “won’t be available for club or country for the foreseeable future” as doctors search for answers to the Chelsea and England forward’s fatigue problem. Kirby missed much of 2019-20 with pericarditis, a condition affecting the fluid-filled sac around the heart, but returned last season to collect player of the year awards from the Professional Football Association, the Football Writers’ Association and Women’s Super League. She had carried her sublime form into the new campaign but has not featured for club or country since February and, with four WSL games left and less than three months to the Euros, time is against her. Writing on social media, Kirby said: “I’m sad that I have to write to you all another message like this. With this being an ongoing issue throughout my career, it was time to put my health first. Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to message, I’m doing everything to try and come back once again. But until then, I will be Chelsea and the Lionesses’ biggest fan with you all.” “She’s been suffering a lot with fatigue,” said Hayes as Chelsea prepared for Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final at Arsenal. “I don’t have a definitive reason why that is, we don’t know, but we’re trying to get to the bottom of it and find the right solutions for Fran because this is something that’s been ongoing and, unfortunately, until we get to the bottom of it she won’t be available for selection.” The Chelsea manager added: “Forget the athlete, she’s a human being and she’s struggling and we’ve got to get to the bottom of that. Until we get to the bottom of it and understand some of the underlying reasons for that fatigue I’d just be speculating. We’re going through a process of elimination to try and determine why she’s struggling like she is … “This has been ongoing for a number of years, if I’m honest, and I think we need to give the time to find the right support so that we can come up with a diagnosis, and then with a diagnosis you can come up with the right strategies.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s Fran Kirby ruled out ‘for foreseeable future’ with fatigue problem,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/fran-kirby-ruled-out-for-foreseeable-future-with-fatigue-problem
4/16/2022,"Richard Moore, who has died suddenly aged 48, was an international bike racer and writer who enhanced the sports media landscape with the foundation of the Cycling Podcast, created with his fellow journalists Daniel Friebe and Lionel Birnie in 2013. The Cycling Podcast was born when Moore and Birnie were looking for work at the 2013 Tour de France, having lost a magazine writing gig shortly before it started. Offering a daily bulletin from the race, their deep knowledge, passion for the sport and contrasting presenting styles – the erudite Birnie, Friebe more intense, Moore the laid-back anchorman – made the podcast an instant hit with cycling fans. The trio had struck at the perfect moment: those were halcyon days for the sport in the UK after the magic season of 2012 when London had hosted the Olympic Games and Sir Bradley Wiggins had won the Tour de France, Chris Froome was set fair for four Tour wins in five years, and Yorkshire was about to host one of the most dramatic and popular Grands Départs the Tour de France has ever seen. By 2015, listener numbers had reached 30,000 and in 2018 the podcast received a bronze medal in the sport category of the British Podcast Awards. Birnie, Friebe and Moore turned it into a cottage industry in its own right, producing offshoots on women’s racing – the Cycling Podcast Féminin, which also won a bronze at the British Podcast Awards – gravel racing, bike tech and on the stories behind and around the Tour de France. They also branched out to cover the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a España, and there were popular stage shows as the three went on tour around the UK and Ireland; in addition there were books, mugs and tea towels. The show has had 48.4 million listens since its inception. Moore was born in Edinburgh, the son of Brian Moore, a management consultant, and Katherine (nee Hunter), a teacher. After studying at Stewart’s Melville college in Edinburgh, he went on to the University of Aberdeen, where he graduated in English literature and was vice-president of the wine society, or so he liked to tell those who travelled with him at the Tour de France. He caught the cycle racing bug from his father, and was Scottish junior road race champion in 1991. His career as a racing cyclist took him to international honours for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998, while he also rode major races such as the PruTour that year, where the team wore striking kit picked out in tartan and were managed by Philippa York, then known as the cyclist Robert Millar. After giving up racing in 1999, Moore turned to journalism, writing initially as a freelance for the magazine Cycling Weekly, and then the Scotsman, for which he covered the Tour de France for the first time in 2005. In contrast to recent successes of British cyclists in the race, in that year’s Tour there was not a single Briton on the start list. The UK’s best racer, the Scot David Millar, was serving a drug ban, so Moore was reduced to playing up the Scottish connections of the English-born Italian racer Dario Cioni to get space in the paper. His first book, In Search of Robert Millar, a biography of his erstwhile team manager, was published in 2007 and was longlisted for the 2008 William Hill sports book of the year. That was followed by Heroes, Villains and Velodromes (2008), the definitive account of how British track cycling dominated the 2008 Beijing Games, and Sky’s the Limit (2011), which detailed the formation of the British squad Team Sky in 2010. He co-wrote Sir Chris Hoy’s autobiography – the pair had been Scotland teammates in Kuala Lumpur and remained close – while his other cycling books, Slaying the Badger (2011) and Etape (2014), dealt with the Tour de France, the former being turned into a successful film. He earned praise for his other, non-cycling, books, The Dirtiest Race in History: Ben Johnson, Carl Lewis and the 1988 Olympic 100m Final (2012), and a biography of Usain Bolt, The Bolt Supremacy (2015). Moore had first appeared on a podcast with Friebe and Birnie to promote The Cycling Anthology, an annual book published by Birnie – they recorded in a London pub and were barely audible over the noise of their fellow drinkers. Having then opted to produce the daily Cycling Podcast from the Tour de France, they were well aware that with the other pressures of writing up each stage they would need some incentive to ensure they stuck to it; it was Moore who made contact with the electronics company Sharp – at that time co-sponsor to the Garmin squad – and drummed up a small amount of cash, “enough to make the commitment worthwhile”, as he put it. After an earlier marriage which ended in divorce, in 2012 Moore married Virginie Pierret, with whom he had a son, Maxime; in 2020 the family moved to northern France, where Moore died the night after reporting on the Gent-Wevelgem one-day classic. In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by his father.

4/16/2022,"The last day of the dinosaurs probably began as a morning like any other. On a sandbank bounded by a river and warm wet forests in what’s now the dusty North Dakota prairies, triceratops and tyrannosaurs laid eggs, roamed, did their late Cretaceous thing. Thescelosaurs and turtles swam in the river. Pterosaurs flew overhead and furry mammalian creatures burrowed underground. On one of the most important days in Planet Earth’s history, as only David Attenborough can so portentously pronounce it, life went on in abundance. Until an asteroid bigger than Mount Everest hit what is now Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with an explosion whose force was greater than that of a billion Hiroshima bombs. In less than two hours, the world as we never knew it was for ever changed. We don’t know exactly when the asteroid hit. But within 40 minutes, the consequences 2,000 miles away at Tanis – the name given to the Dakotan sandbank by the palaeontologists who have been digging there for a decade – were profound. Dinosaurs: The Final Day With David Attenborough (BBC One) recreates those last terrifying minutes as wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis and seismic waves ravaged the globe and all life at Tanis was swiftly entombed in sediment. For context, this was 60m years before we pitched (or rather stood) up. And we’re seeing in real time how that’s panning out. That’s just the last half-hour of Dinosaurs: The Final Day. And it’s disturbingly prescient for something that happened 66m years ago. I found myself sloshing back and forth, much like the Norwegian fjords mysteriously did in 2011 after an earthquake hit Japan, while watching this slick, gripping and elegiac feature-length documentary. Lurching from abject despair at our our contemporary role in this history to profound awe at our ability to unearth its deep mysteries. The signature Attenborough cocktail of feelings, then. One of my scribbled notes simply reads: “We are the asteroid.” Dinosaurs: The Final Day deftly uses state-of-the-art FX and a virtual production studio, which I no more understand than the Sauron-esque eye of the Oxfordshire synchrotron, where lead palaeontologist Robert DePalma takes his astonishing finds to be scanned. The point is to transport us back to the late Cretaceous so we can see for ourselves how the dinosaurs’ last days might have been. And how Attenborough would have looked (like a fish very much in water, naturally) having his chinos sniffed by our cute furry ancestors. Edge-of-your-seat stuff for some, but for me virtual FX in nature/science documentaries tend to induce the disappointment of fake flowers: never as stirring as the real thing. More exciting is the dig at Hell Creek Formation. Here, DePalma and his team are excavating a mass dinosaur graveyard entombed in a layer of crumbly rock. Happily, DePalma has Indiana Jones levels of magnetism, and can unearth a good line with as much class as he wields his trowel (and fedora). “It’s like trying to defuse a nuclear weapon while you’re in a rainstorm,” he drawls, brushing the mass death layer. While “performing surgery on a Cretaceous fish”, he discovers tiny balls of molten rock in the fish’s gill bars. They are ejector spherules propelled into the atmosphere by the asteroid, which “last saw the light of day when they were flying through the air 66 million years ago”. In a knot of amber, he finds spherules containing a perfectly preserved particle “of the bullet that killed the dinosaurs”. The asteroid itself. Wow. In another thrilling moment of this detective story set in deep time, the team uncover what has never before been found: the body of a dinosaur killed by the effects of the asteroid’s impact. “I think we got ourselves a dinosaur!” DePalma cries as they dig a square of sediment that, to me, looks like any other square of sediment. Hours later, the fossilised leg of a thescelosaurus, skin and tissue included, emerges, looking “like a Thanksgiving turkey”. The leg’s location, entangled in the “log jam” of Tanis’s mass death layer, which is where they found the meteorite-flecked amber and spherules, is proof enough. The dinosaur died as a result of the asteroid collision. After that Earth-shattering day, sulphur ejected by the asteroid blocked all sunlight. The planet was plunged into semi-darkness for a decade. Temperatures dropped dramatically. On land, the plants died and in the seas the plankton vanished. Three quarters of all species were wiped out. “Then,” says Attenborough, “came something wonderful.” Plant life returned, and with it, some of the smallest and most resourceful creatures, including our little furry ancestors who had survived the nuclear winter in their burrows. And Attenborough hasn’t given up, either. “We are unique in our ability to learn from the distant past,” he concludes. “Now we must use that ability wisely … to protect the millions of species for whom, alongside us, this planet is home.” ",Arts/Television & radio,Dinosaurs: The Final Day With David Attenborough review – a thrilling slice of time-travelling detective work,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/15/dinosaurs-the-final-day-with-david-attenborough-review-a-thrilling-slice-of-time-travelling-detective-work
4/16/2022,"Alot can change in a week in football but for Sean Dyche the problem was a lack of change in a decade at Turf Moor. His methods were tried and tested: play 4-4-2 and finish 17th or above. Dyche was the master of keeping unfashionable Burnley in the Premier League but the faith of the players and owners ran out. Ten of the squad that beat Chelsea on the opening day of the 2017-18 season and took them to a seventh-placed finish are still at the club. Some would see it as a sign of stability but others would argue the team have not evolved in that time, when the plan rarely changed week-to-week and season-to-season. Senior players grew frustrated that areas of weakness were not addressed in recent years, leaving the squad short of depth and in need of revitalising. Players such as Phil Bardsley have been kept on, rather than being replaced. Bardsley has appeared four times in two seasons in the Premier League, and not since February 2021. Dyche has not called on him in the league this season despite naming him on the bench on 24 occasions. It spoke volumes that with Ben Mee and Nathan Collins absent through injury and suspension respectively, the 31-year-old Kevin Long was asked to make his first appearance in 14 months for the club in the recent loss to Manchester City. Loyalty to players has always been important to Dyche but without Chris Wood his limited striking options have been highlighted. Ashley Barnes joined in 2014 and has a scoring record of less than one in every five games, including no goals this season; Matej Vydra’s best season at Burnley has brought him a grand total of three goals; Jay Rodriguez hit one in 31 appearances last season, following it up with two in 26 this time; and Wout Weghorst has one in 12 since joining in January. While the defence have kept their end of the bargain with seven clean sheets, the strikers have repeatedly fallen short in recent times, another source of frustration in the team. Dyche struggled to rally the players for a fourth relegation battle in six years, securing no wins between the end of October and mid-February. The team’s predictability was becoming a problem as other clubs evolved and spent more money to improve their sides while progress was limited at Turf Moor. Despite the poor results, the style and formation were kept the same with the confidence that it would eventually come good despite evidence to the contrary, leaving players disillusioned. The blame cannot be laid purely at Dyche’s door given that he worked within set parameters. Despite the takeover by ALK Capital last year, a deal which left the club £90m worse off, the budget has remained limited. Money has been spent on Collins, Connor Roberts, Maxwel Cornet and Weghorst, who was signed as a replacement for Wood. Newcastle paid £25m for Wood but Weghorst cost less than half that and was the only January arrival despite Burnley’s struggles. Other players were targeted but the club failed to get deals over the line, much to the chagrin of many at Turf Moor, leaving them light for the battle they face. Even in 2020-21 the only first-team player to sign was the central midfielder Dale Stephens, who has been unable to become a regular. Dyche leaves Burnley four points from a safe position with eight games to go after a pitiful loss against the Championship-bound Norwich. The problems of the club were laid bare at Carrow Road, where Weghorst was taken off after 56 ineffectual minutes to be replaced by Vydra, who has scored seven league goals in three and a half seasons at the club. Unsurprisingly, Burnley did not get back into the game; they managed four shots on target against a side who have conceded 63 times this season, to leave the players dejected for the final time under Dyche. The next manager will inherit a squad in Dyche’s mould and have to reinvigorate it in a short space of time. It is unlikely the style and formation will change much but a fresh approach in the dressing room is much wanted and needed with survival on the line. Dyche’s impact will not be forgotten. Two promotions and European qualification will be the on-pitch legacy that he leaves. Away from it, helping Burnley become a relatively stable Premier League side has allowed them to invest in a new training ground and he will forever be welcome in The Royal Dyche pub in the town.

4/16/2022,"There is a terrifying moment in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner where the crew of the mariner’s ship, lost at sea under a merciless sun, are visited by a mind-blowing vision: a ghost galleon containing only the figure of Death and a sad, pale woman. Alone on their putrid deck, Death and the sad, pale woman – who to be fair, probably expected something more along the lines of cabaret and a buffet – play an arbitrary game of dice for the lives of the (already dying) crew. Literary scholars have argued for centuries over the meaning of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem. And while there is no hard evidence Coleridge ever intended his vision as an allegory for the state of English men’s red-ball cricket in the late Joe Root captaincy era, well, the imagination is certainly a mysterious place. As Root’s resignation brings to a close the last two years of desiccated decline – no coach, no selectors, management speak everywhere but not a drop of leadership – it is hard to avoid the sense of something equally lonely and equally doomed in his final course through that dying sea as England’s Test captain. As of Friday morning there is at least some overdue closure. That last sad, pale figure has vacated the deck, all played out after 64 matches and five difficult years. And for all concerned Root’s resignation will bring feelings of relief above all. Most obviously for Root himself, whose time as captain has been remarkable on two fronts. First, for its basic longevity. In many ways the only significant, or even noteworthy thing about Root’s captaincy was the fact he managed to do it for so long. “Root holds the record for the most number of matches and wins as England Men’s Test Captain,” was the top line from the ECB, dishing up the usual spin and puff even here. This is technically true. But then if we’re going to play that game Root also holds the record for most losses by an England captain, and by some distance. Only two men have ever lost more games as Test captain of any nation in the history of cricket. Root’s loss-ratio is higher even than the pre-modern Mike Atherton era, when the playing XI was culled from whichever 12 names the selectors could scrawl on the back of a committee room menu after a particularly gruelling lunch. The numbers only ever tell a part of the story. But they do bring us on to the second remarkable thing about Root’s England captaincy: the fact it is still apparently necessary to have a debate about whether he was any good at it or not. The short answer to this is very simple. No. He wasn’t. This has nothing to do with the fact Root was, is and will remain a nice person and a gracious competitor. It doesn’t detract from the sublime quality of his batting, where he is on another plane, arguably England’s greatest of all time given his numbers in every format and the fresh air between Root and everyone else on the same pitch against the same attacks. But captaincy is a distinct and highly complex thing, and above all a matter of getting the best out of others. Five years on, it is still hard to pick out what a Root team was meant to look like, how it planned to win, what its defining features were outside of hysterical collapses with the bat and periods of drift in the field. Blame the players by all means. But those who have been in international dressing rooms will also point to the vital role of leadership when this happens. All teams run to some extent on vibes, energy, plans that become good plans just because everyone knows it’s the plan. There were obvious details too, like captaining spin bowlers, which remained an embarrassing blind spot. The use of Jack Leach in the first Ashes Test was up there, as howlers go, with allowing Jofra Archer to bowl a career-maiming 42 overs at Mount Maunganui. None of this was malice or a lack of application. Often Root just seemed a little too gentle up close, too agreeable to do the ruthless, risky things that amount to leadership. Often he would reply to difficult questions by saying the issue was “above my pay grade”, where in reality, nothing was above his pay grade, as the highest-paid individual in the history of England cricket. This was the frustration, and indeed the paradox of Root’s longevity; the sense of a leader helplessly caught up in wider tides of change. The most bizarre discussion around his extended departure has been the insistence that England’s team is so poor, its cricket so degraded, that the captaincy has become irrelevant, that what is happening here is an existential crisis in the red-ball game, that England do not deserve to seek out a slightly better Test captain. In reality it is remarkable what a difference those fine details can make, just as the England captaincy is not some holy garland to be clutched on to in perpetuity, or passed down only to those with the right sense of officer class permanence. Frankly Matt Fisher could have got the gig for the last 17 Test matches and England wouldn’t have done any worse. At least in its sense of drift Root’s England has captured the essence of the age. But his departure was essential for other reasons too. Mainly because this arcane old code has to have consequences and jeopardy – one win in 17 has to matter – or frankly the gig is up and what we’re left with is matches that simply die away, where Ollie Robinson is playing a lap sweep as his stumps explode and an Ashes series is euthanised gratefully out of existence. As for next things, Stuart Broad would be a hugely entertaining mistake. Ben Stokes will probably get it. And who knows, a little change of energy, a shifting of the deckchairs on the ghost ship deck might just draw a few more breaths of wind in those raggedy sails.",Sport/Sport,ECB’s statistical spin hides the fact that Joe Root was sunk as England captain | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/15/joe-root-england-captain-ecb-cricket-comment
4/16/2022,"Manchester United fans unhappy at the Glazer family ownership gathered outside the club’s Carrington training ground complex on Friday morning to mount a peaceful protest, with police called to bolster security. Two anti-Glazer banners were displayed and the crowd of about 30 people dispersed approximately half an hour before Ralf Rangnick held his weekly Friday media briefing at 1.15pm. The gathering comes before a planned protest on Saturday outside Old Trafford when the team host Norwich City. Asked about the protest Rangnick said: “We all know football is a game of passion and emotions. We can all understand – I can understand our supporters are disappointed with our standing in the table and the performance we showed at Everton [losing 1-0], at least after we conceded that first goal. “But I still believe our supporters are one of the best, if not the best, in England and as long as they protest in a peaceful way and support the team in the stadium, they have a right to express their opinion.” Organisers of Saturday’s demonstration have called for participants not to enter Old Trafford until 3.17pm – to represent a minute for every year since Malcolm Glazer purchased the the club. A United spokesperson said: “There was a small and peaceful protest outside the Carrington training ground today. We respect the opinions of fans and remain committed to strengthening our engagement with them.” Luke Shaw is unlikely to play again this season because of complications relating to ongoing treatment for the double leg fracture the defender suffered against PSV Eindhoven in 2015. “As it seems, he will be out for at least another four or five weeks,” Rangnick said. “It will be difficult for him to be available for the remaining seven games.” Fred, Scott McTominay, Edinson Cavani and Raphaël Varane are also injured. Meanwhile, Nemanja Matic has announced he will leave United at the end of the season. The 33-year-old has a year remaining on his deal but has decided he wants a fresh challenge having joined the club from Chelsea for £40m in July 2017. “After a great deal of thought, I have decided that this season will be my last with Manchester United. I have informed the board, the manager and the players of my decision,” Matic wrote on Instagram. “It has been a huge honour and a privilege to play for this great club. A big thank you to the fans for their unwavering support. I will now give everything until the end of the season to help my team-mates finish as strongly as possible.”",Sport/Football,Manchester United fans hold anti-Glazer protest at training ground,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/manchester-united-fans-hold-anti-glazer-protest-at-training-ground
4/16/2022,"The UN’s refugee agency has condemned Boris Johnson’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as “a symbolic gesture” that will be unworkable in practice. Speaking to the Guardian, Gillian Triggs, the assistant high commissioner at the UNHCR, said the proposed arrangement would only accommodate a few hundred people a year, making it extremely expensive as well as illegal and discriminatory. Ministers insisted on Friday that the scheme would save money in the “longer term”, despite a reported cost of up to £30,000 per person. But government insiders said the expected torrent of legal battles could leave it costing substantially more, with some predicting it could take two years before anyone was flown to Rwanda. Home Office sources said they were braced for judicial reviews and a wave of immigration tribunals over the lawfulness of attempts to offshore asylum seekers who arrive after travelling across the Channel on small boats. There are two appeal stages for judicial reviews and three for those seeking to challenge their removal through an immigration tribunal, casting in more doubt Johnson’s stated aim of removing people to the central African country in the next six weeks. Home secretary Priti Patel signed a “ministerial direction” authorising the policy to be implemented despite an objection on spending grounds from her department’s permanent secretary. A Home Office source said the ministerial direction was issued because the savings made in the long-term by the new policy could “not be quantified with certainty” but that Patel did not want to let “a lack of precise modelling” hold the decision back. Downing Street has said it expects that thousands of asylum seekers will be relocated within the first few years of the scheme. Triggs accused the UK of “attempting to shift its burden to a developing country” and warned that the arrangement signed off by Patel “would not comply with the UK’s international legal responsibilities”, adding: “All the indications are that it will be unworkable.” Triggs continued: “We want to end the vulnerability of people on the move to people-trafficking and of course we want to stop people drowning, but we strongly disagree with victimising the very people who need protection. There should instead be an increase in legal pathways to the UK.” The proposals seemed designed to appeal to anti-migrant sentiment in the UK, she suggested. “We are a politically neutral, humanitarian body – it’s not really for me to comment on the politics,” Triggs said. “But we are in an environment in which populist governments will appeal to their rightwing, anti-migrant sentiment and this would presumably be part of that.” Two former Tory international development secretaries on Friday voiced their opposition to the policy, and cast doubt on whether the government would successfully fly anyone to Rwanda. Rory Stewart told the Guardian there was a “very strong possibility it’s complete pie in the sky” and had been “rushed out to distract people” from the prime minister being fined by police for attending a party in Downing Street that broke Covid laws. Stewart, a minister under Theresa May, said that when he was in government, it was hard enough to remove citizens of some countries back to their place of birth. “It’s a completely extraordinary thing to be doing and I think legal challenges will mean they won’t make it on to the planes,” he predicted. Stewart, who visited Rwanda earlier in the month, said it was “one of the very poorest countries on Earth” and a “particularly extreme environment into which to put people”. The Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell also said it was an impractical, immoral and incredibly expensive plan. “The costs are eye-watering,” he told the BBC. “You’re going to send people 6,000 miles into central Africa – it looked when it was discussed in parliament before that it would actually be cheaper to put each asylum seeker in the Ritz hotel in London.” Triggs also warned that the UK was introducing a discriminatory approach towards refugees, offering an uncapped scheme for asylum seekers from Ukraine and a “draconian” system for refugees from other countries. “At the political level, we are seeing levels of discrimination,” Triggs said. “We are deeply concerned that the processes appear to be discriminatory. One of the fundamental principles of international law is is non-discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnicity or nationality.” Triggs hoped the popular support for Britons to house Ukrainian refugees would encourage the government to rethink its proposals. She said: “We saw an outpouring of sympathy and generosity by the British people themselves. So we see this announcement as out of character with British values. We hope that the public response will help to ameliorate the negative aspects of this proposal with Rwanda.” Johnson was also sent a letter by 150 British organisations supporting refugees that warned the plan would “cause immense suffering” and “result in more, not fewer, dangerous journeys – leaving more people at risk of being trafficked”. The signatories, including the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, LGBT+ refugee advocates Rainbow Migration and HOPE not Hate, said Rwanda had “a poor record on human rights” and the most vulnerable people were set to “bear the brunt”. Alf Dubs, a Labour peer who was a child refugee, told the Guardian he expected there would be “quite a battle” over the issue. The Bishop of Durham, who also sits in the House of Lords, has signalled his opposition to the policy, saying it is “wrong in so many ways”. Home Office minister Tom Pursglove defended the Rwanda initiative, saying it would “crush” the business model of people smugglers and lower the costs of housing all those that arrive in the UK illegally, which he said ran to £5m per day. He said on top of the £120m already committed to fund the scheme, “we will continue to make contributions to Rwanda as they process the cases, in a manner that is similar to the amount of money we are spending on this currently here in the UK”. Pursglove added: “But longer term, by getting this under control, it should help us to save money. “We are spending £5m per day accommodating individuals who are crossing in hotels. That is not sustainable and is not acceptable and we have to get that under control.”",News/UK news,UN refugee agency condemns Boris Johnson’s Rwanda asylum plan ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/un-refugee-agency-condemns-johnsons-rwanda-asylum-plan
4/16/2022,"Former White House aide Stephen Miller testified on Thursday to the House select committee investigating January 6 about whether Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol, according to a source familiar with the matter. The virtual deposition, which lasted for roughly eight hours and was earlier reported by the New York Times, also touched on Miller’s role in the former president’s schemes to overturn the results of the 2020 election and return him to office, the source said. Miller was Trump’s top domestic policy adviser and chief speechwriter. His appearance made him the latest Trump White House official to speak to the select committee, a day after Trump White House counsels Pat Cipollone and Pat Philbin talked to the panel for the first time. House investigators asked Miller about the language in Trump’s speech at the rally that took place at the Ellipse on January 6, a speech that Miller helped draft, the source said. The select committee focused on the use of the word “we” throughout Trump’s speech, which it believes had the effect of encouraging the crowd to march to the Capitol in order to pressure Congress to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win, the source said. Trump used the term repeatedly over the course of his 75-minute speech, including when he told his supporters “we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue … and we are going to the Capitol.” The remarks, House investigators reportedly believe, amounted to an effort by Trump to encourage his supporters to march from the Ellipse to the Capitol on a false pretense, in the hope that they would disrupt Congress from certifying Biden as president. That determination has come in part after the select committee reviewed Trump’s private schedule for that day, which showed there were no plans for the former president to join such a march, and that he was to be back to the White House, the source said. Proof of bad intention on the part of Trump could bolster the select committee’s claim in the filing that he engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States by seeking to obstruct a lawful function of the government by deceitful or dishonest means. Miller contested that characterization, and told the select committee the use of the word “we” in Trump’s remarks was not an effort to incite the crowd to storm the Capitol but a rhetorical tool used in political speeches for decades, the New York Times reported. The panel is in possession of the speech and several draft versions, the source said. Miller, who testified pursuant to a subpoena issued in November, helped draft the speech with two other Trump aides – Vince Haley and Ross Worthington – who have also been subpoenaed. The select committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Miller’s testimony. Over the course of the extended deposition, House investigators asked Miller about his role in a brazen scheme to pressure legislatures to send slates of pro-Trump electors to Congress on January 6 in battleground states actually won by Biden, the source said. The select committee also asked Miller about the former president’s claims about election fraud. Miller told the select committee that the election had been stolen, and raised several instances of the supposed fraud, the source said. Miller’s appearance was at times heated and adversarial, the source added. Miller invoked executive privilege to some questions concerning his conversations with Trump, and only testified in response to the subpoena and after protracted negotiations involving his lawyer.",News/US news,Ex-Trump aide Stephen Miller testifies to House January 6 panel for eight hours,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/15/stephen-miller-january-6-deposition-trump
4/16/2022,"“Labour is definitely due a comeback now,” said Wakefield market stall owner Mohammad Javed. After coming to the area from Pakistan aged 16, he has spent the last four decades observing life in the town centre from his busy high street spot. “I’ve seen the rise and fall of this town, I know the locals, and I’m telling you – the Tories have outstayed their welcome.” Javed said he was not as critical of the Conservatives as many of his customers and fellow stall owners, but that he would never consider voting for them after the local Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan was this week convicted of assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008. “It’s shocking and appalling,” Javed said. “Add to that the inhumane foreign policy – the announcement that asylum seekers will be sent to Rwanda for processing – and you’ve got a completely untrustworthy party.” Like many Wakefield residents, his feelings about the former MP are tied into an overall distrust and disillusionment with those in power. After Ahmad Khan’s resignation, the fight for the marginal red wall seat is on. It will be a significant test for the leadership of Keir Starmer, offering the possibility of the first Labour byelection win from the Tories in a decade, and a possible indication of the way the wind is blowing before May’s local elections. Tony Murray, a lifelong Labour voter who grew up in Wakefield, gave up his membership and voted Conservative when Jeremy Corbyn became party leader. Now he says he will be going back to Labour. “For me, Partygate did it,” he said. “I lost someone during the pandemic and I can’t abide the double standard the Tories have shown. I feel so let down.” Cliff and Lisa Wright share Murray’s frustration, but feel Labour would not be able to address the economic challenges the local area faces. “The town is in desperate need of change and regeneration. We think the Ahmad Khan news will definitely swing sentiment to the left, but personally we’ll be sticking with the Conservatives. Let’s not let one bad apple spoil the whole barrel.” Their daughter, Danielle Wright, who grew up in Wakefield and is a dentistry student at Newcastle University, strongly disagreed, citing Partygate and Priti Patel’s foreign policy as the main reasons. “The Tories made a mockery of the Covid rules. Those photos of Johnson and Co socialising in the middle of lockdown were a real knife in the back for the rest of us,” she said. “As for Patel and the Rwanda deal, how can she be so hypocritical as to introduce rules so harsh they would prevent her own family being in the UK?” Walking through Wakefield, it is clear this is a place trying to redefine itself after decades of post-industrial decline. Boarded-up pubs and social clubs jostle alongside brand new branches of H&M and Zara. Artisan food shops and boutiques are popping up amid dilapidated warehouses. Michael Graham, Labour councillor for Wakefield West, believes this tension presents a real opportunity for the area. “Wakefield has been without an MP for the best part of a year,” he said, as Ahmad Khan faced legal proceedings. “And in response, its people have pulled together. They want better for their town. “Following Ahmad Khan’s conviction, some serious questions have to be asked. And regarding the Rwanda plan, I’ve already had a handful of emails this morning from constituents describing the decision as ‘nonsensical and cruel’.” Labour held Wakefield from the 1930s until Khan’s victory in the 2019 general election and Graham believes the shift to the right happened because people were not feeling heard, but he is optimistic over Labour’s chances of byelection victory. Without Corbyn’s leadership and after Brexit, amid a cost of living crisis, he argues Wakefield is “very winnable”. “The cost of living crisis is a major issue for people in my constituency,” he said. “Token tax rebates aren’t enough. I went to the food bank yesterday and there were people there who had never set foot in a food bank and never thought they would have to. Wakefield deserves better.” Graham shared stories of constituents who have been in touch outraged over the “tone deaf” decisions Tories have made in recent weeks and months, and insists these decisions have left even the most ardent of lifelong Conservative voters undecided about which way to vote. In a quiet corner of the town centre, Howard and Linda Greensmith seem to sum up the mood in Wakefield: “This is a Labour town, filled with Labour people. On election day, everything is to play for.”",News/Politics,Wakefield’s disillusioned residents say it is time for political change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/15/wakefields-disillusioned-residents-say-its-time-for-political-change
4/16/2022,"The bodies of women and girls have long been a battlefield in war. This week, the UN’s high representative on sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, warned that reports of attacks in Ukraine were increasing exponentially, while Sima Bahous, executive director of UN Women, called for an independent investigation into sexual violence there. The brutal accounts of assaults by Russian troops have chilling echoes of wars elsewhere. According to the UN, there were heightened levels of conflict-related sexual violence last year. Rape is one of the most common atrocities in wartime, though in some wars it is particularly widespread and even systematic. The vulnerable – such as disabled people – are often targeted. And war puts women at increased risk even when they have fled the conflict zone, or when a conflict has ended. Ms Patten fears that a humanitarian crisis is turning into a trafficking crisis, and the UN refugee agency has urged the UK not to allow single men to host lone Ukrainian women following predatory approaches. Yet despite its prevalence, sexual violence is one of the least understood, reported and punished crimes in conflict. Stigma and fear – including of the reaction of their own families and communities – prevent victims from coming forward. Men and boys are attacked too and may be even more reluctant to disclose what has happened to them. Survivors know that their attackers are unlikely to suffer any consequences, while they must live with trauma, punitive social costs and often long-term damage to their health. The broader difficulties of pursuing perpetrators in what some have termed an “age of impunity” – so visible in Russia’s actions from Grozny to Aleppo – are well documented. But it is also true that rape has not been treated with the same gravity as other offences. It was not listed in the indictments for the Nuremberg trials, and the Tokyo tribunals never addressed the Chinese and Korean women forced into sexual slavery by Japanese troops. There was no justice for the estimated 2 million German women raped by Soviet soldiers after the country’s defeat. The hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi women held in rape camps by Pakistani troops in the 1971 war never saw their attackers punished. The 1949 Geneva conventions specify that “Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault.” But it is only relatively recently that a fuller understanding of the crime has emerged, treating it not as the “spoils of war” or extension of an existing culture of sexual violence, but as a weapon used to terrify, dehumanise and even destroy the enemy. In the 1990s, the horror of the systematic rape of Bosnian women and Rwandan women led to the successful prosecution of rape as a crime against humanity and then as an act of genocide, at the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. But members of Islamic State have yet to be punished for systematic sexual violence towards Yazidi women. Prosecutions for rape in conflict remain extremely rare. As foreign secretary, William Hague launched a high-profile initiative to prevent sexual violence in war zones, but attention – and funding – ebbed after his departure. Liz Truss was right to renew the UK’s commitment. Experts have called for specialist training of lawyers and psychologists at all tribunals. The Global Survivors Fund, launched by Nobel peace laureates Dr Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, seeks to improve reparations. But above all, what is needed is the international will to address the issue, with increased financial and political backing for bodies such as the international criminal court, and a determination to prioritise tackling sexual violence.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on ending rape in war: endemic but largely unpunished | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-ending-in-war-endemic-but-largely-unpunished
4/16/2022,"This week the Indigenous Sámi people of Norway celebrated a historic event: the return to the village of Karasjok (Kárášjohka in the northern Sámi language) of a rune drum that had been confiscated in 1691 from a Sámi man who was tried for witchcraft. At the time, the Nordic colonisers of the Arctic were energetically Christianising the Sámi population, whose animist spirituality depended on a sense of connectedness with the lands they inhabited and the animals with which they interacted. Rune drums, made from birchwood and reindeer skin, helped a noaidi, or shaman, to enter a trance and walk among spirits. They could also be used to divine future events: insight was gained by noting where, when the drum was struck, a ring moved in relation to the symbols painted on its surface. This particular noaidi drum – there are many examples in museums in Sweden, Germany, the UK and elsewhere – happens to be particularly well documented. The court transcripts survive, including a detailed account given by its owner, Poala-Ánde, of its uses. He claimed, poignantly, that “he wanted to help people in distress, and with his art he wanted to do good”. A verdict was never reached in the trial since, before it could be handed down, Poala-Ánde was brutally murdered. The confiscated drum was sent to the authorities in Copenhagen and passed into the royal collection, becoming part of the National Museum of Denmark. Over the past 40 years, during which time the drum has been on loan to the Sámi Museum in Karasjok, the Sámi people have been arguing for ownership to be formally handed over to the institution. After an appeal to Queen Margrethe of Denmark, that has at last happened. “I feel,” said Silje Karine Muotka, president of the Sámi parliament in Norway, “that [Poala-Ánde’s] power is with us as we continue to take ownership of our own history for future generations.” The Sámi people – whose population of 60-70,000 is scattered through Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia’s Kola peninsula – have long been the victims of internal colonialism, their views sidelined in the rush for natural resources, whether timber, nickel or even wind power. Now they find themselves on the frontline of climate crisis, with rising temperatures affecting Arctic weather patterns, ecosystems, and traditional ways of living such as reindeer herding. But, with a revival in political self-consciousness, and a young generation taking back the dwindling Sámi languages and taking pride in their culture, the people of the Sápmi nation are taking their place among a network of Indigenous peoples from around the world, notably those from the Amazon, who are increasingly being recognised as holders of knowledge that may yet help the wider world tackle climate crisis. Later this month, too, Sámi artists will step on to the global stage when they exhibit in the Nordic pavilion – renamed this year the Sámi pavilion – at the world’s most celebrated international art event, the Venice Biennale. The Sámi drum is a powerful symbol of a people insisting on the validity of their belief systems – systems that tell us that humans, animals and land are intimately connected, and that harm to one means harm to all.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on returning a Sámi shaman’s drum: a sign of hope | Editorial ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-returning-a-sami-shamans-drum-a-sign-of-hope
4/16/2022,"In almost all other tennis careers, players tend to have the benefit of making their first mistakes in relative silence. The first steps on a new surface usually take place in the anonymity of the ITF circuit or in the back courts of a lower level tour event – they learn, they grow, and then eventually they thrive on their terms. It is fair to say that such avenues are no longer open to Emma Raducanu. On Friday she was charged with finding her feet on clay as the No 1 player for her country against the dominant nation in the sport. Moments earlier, her teammate, Harriet Dart, had managed to win just one game in the opening rubber. The pressure was undeniable. Yet she rose to the moment admirably, recovering from doubtful deficits in both sets through the strength of her grit and perseverance, eventually overcoming No 50 Tereza Martincova 7-5, 7-5 to win on her Billie Jean King Cup debut and keep Great Britain in contention. Earlier in the day, Marketa Vondrousova opened the tie by eviscerating Dart 6-1, 6-0, meaning the BJK Cup Qualifier with the Czech Republic is finely poised at 1-1 ahead of the final day. “This one means so much to me because it is my first match in the Billie Jean King Cup,” said Raducanu afterwards. “To represent my team and come out here for my first professional match on a clay court is really amazing. We are still in this battle. It’s all to play for tomorrow.” As the attritional exchanges took hold in frequent gusts of wind, Martincova continually picked apart the Raducanu forehand, challenging her to dictate off her weaker wing while grinding her down. It slowly worked as Martincova broke serve at 4-4 and generated a set point as she attempted to serve out the set. But as the match wore on, Raducanu searched for solutions and she found them. She began to implement more topspin into her strokes, throwing up loopy balls to arrest the momentum of rallies or dragging Martincova off the court with additional width. Raducanu saved the set point at 5-4 and reeled off three tough games to take the set. In the second set, however, her level dropped as she fell down 1-4 with two breaks. But this time Raducanu pulled her game together by continuing to disrupt Martincova by varying the trajectory of her shots. In the numerous exhausting games that followed, including a manic game at 4-4 on Raducanu’s serve that included nine deuces and four break points, she slowly pulled back to win. “I’ve [been] playing really good tennis for a set, maybe a set and a half, then my energy dips,” she said. “And then I find myself in an absolute battle and it lets me down. But today I feel like it’s another step in the right direction because I’ve managed to overcome that. So that does give me a lot of confidence.” Raducanu arrived in Prague with a 2-5 record in 2022 and this is the highest ranked opponent she has even taken a set off since the US Open semi-final. A personal step forward for her, it also puts her team in an interesting position as she returns on Saturday morning to face Vondrousova as the clear underdog. In the opening rubber, Vondrousova responded to losing her opening service game by reeling off 12 games in a row to dismantle Dart in 55 minutes. For Dart, the challenge would have been extremely difficult on any surface, but on clay against the 2019 French Open finalist, who is an artist with the drop shot, it was simply overwhelming. The one-sided result leaves captain Anne Keothavong with a decision to make about whether to play Dart again, Katie Swan or particularly the promising but completely inexperienced 20-year-old Sonay Kartal. “I believe we’ve got a good chance,” said Keothavong. “We came here as underdogs. The Czechs still are the heavy favourites but we will review how both matches went todayand put all the game plans in place. It requires the players to be able to execute under pressure, but they will be as well prepared as possible.” As Keothavong finished, Raducanu leaned forward with a mischievous smile on her face to address no one in particular: “The Brits love being underdogs, by the way,” she said.",Sport/Sport,Raducanu battles past Martincova as Britain level Billie Jean King Cup tie ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/emma-raducanu-shows-spirit-against-tereza-martincova-to-level-billie-jean-cup-tie
4/16/2022,"When you are faced with opposition on the level of this St Helens side – arguably the best of the modern era, though that is a discussion for another day – it is those little glimmers of hope which hurt the most. By the end, Wigan’s race in the latest instalment of rugby league’s richest rivalry had long since been run, with a ninth defeat in 10 against their greatest foes from across the Billinge Hill somewhat of a formality. The final scoreline underlines the dominance St Helens have on everyone else in Super League, and that includes a Wigan side who are almost certainly their greatest obstacle to a fourth consecutive title as things stand. Yet it is just how ruthless the reigning champions are when their backs are against the wall which sets them apart. Wigan had played their part in a thrilling opening quarter, and arguably even deserved to take the lead in front of a sellout crowd of 17,980. Jai Field’s try which made it 4-0 in the Warriors’ favour had threatened a much closer derby than we ended up with. There would have been cautious optimism, perhaps even hope, among the thousands of travelling Wigan supporters that they could grind out what would have been a famous victory against their great rivals. Throw in the fact that St Helens’s Morgan Knowles, arguably the best forward in Super League, left the field with a head knock and never returned, and you wondered what was in store here. But in the end, this ruthless, metronomic rugby league juggernaut did what they always do. They responded to those moments of adversity, clicked through the gears and, by the time the full-time hooter had sounded, they had once again underlined their superiority in one-sided fashion. After that Field try, St Helens scored 22 unanswered points either side of half-time to vanquish the hope which may have briefly accrued in the minds of Wigan supporters. “This group did what they do every week,” Kristian Woolf said. “They hung in, they didn’t get frustrated and eventually we found the points we needed.” Both major derbies on Good Friday went the way of the home sides, with Hull Kingston Rovers further suggesting they are now the dominant club by the banks of the Humber after a deserved 16-4 victory against Hull FC. Here, Field’s early try put the Warriors ahead but St Helens responded to going behind superbly as Konrad Hurrell’s flick pass sent Tommy Makinson across in the corner. That levelled the scores at 4-4 but, with half-time approaching, St Helens began to up the intensity. As they piled the pressure on the Warriors, it felt like an inevitability when they eventually went ahead as Makinson and Jonny Lomax combined to send the latter across. Makinson converted, before adding a penalty on half-time to make it 12-4 and, despite a promising start, Wigan suddenly found themselves two scores behind. “When they got opportunities they took them, they were clinical,” Wigan’s coach, Matty Peet, said. “In the second half they were much better and we failed to hold them.” There were only 10 points scored in that second half but they all went St Helens’s way. The first try after half-time was crucial in the context of the game, and it went to the hosts when Mark Percival teed up Joe Batchelor. Sam Powell was then sent to the sin bin for a dangerous tackle which could see him banned for an extended period and, when he was off the field, Percival pounced on a loose pass to make absolutely sure that, as it has been so many times in recent years, this would be St Helens’s day.",Sport/Sport,St Helens win one-sided derby as Mark Percival piles misery on Wigan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/st-helens-win-one-sided-derby-as-mark-percival-piles-misery-on-wigan
4/16/2022,"As someone of mixed Scottish and English heritage who was brought up in a town with a large population of people with a Scottish background, I found Rory Scothorne’s article interesting (An independent Scotland would need a national anthem – but what would it be?, 9 April). But he does not make clear enough the main problem with Flower of Scotland. It is about a battle that took place nearly 700 years ago, when the Scottish king beat the English one. It is blatantly anti-English. This is also one of the main problems with Scottish nationalism. It seems that the main desire of its proponents is to put one over the English. If Scotland and its people want to move forward as a nation, they should choose an anthem that looks forward, not back.Gordon GlassfordCorby, Northamptonshire  I’m sure I won’t be alone in advocating for Michael Marra’s Hermless to be the new national anthem. Marra’s advocacy of the virtues of quietism in part reflects his Dundonian background; in a city of independent wage-earner women, male partners could be relegated to the role of “kettle bilers”, while the women went out to work in the city’s mills. Being everything a national anthem shouldn’t be, Hermless’s advocacy of never causing “bother” is just perfect for a new day. If you’re Scottish and you haven’t heard it, I can only ask, “whit’s wrang wi’ ye?” For the non-Scot, there’s Loudon Wainwright’s anglicised version, Harmless; he describes Marra’s song as the greatest ever written.Alistair RichardsonStirling  As a Scot who has long lived in various countries and is now retired in France, I have an occasional twinge of nostalgia for my homeland. But a recent conversation with friends revealed that many feel Flower of Scotland is too dirge-like. I do not know the other songs cited in Rory Scothorne’s article, but I would vote for Scotland the Brave – the lyrics are so evocative. While not being martial, it competes favourably with the stirring La Marseillaise, which, despite a certain bloodthirstiness, comes in high on any list of uplifting anthems.Veronica StiastnySt Romain-en-Viennois, France  National anthems should celebrate the culture and ethos of a country, not the killing of a neighbour. Hamish Henderson’s wonderful Freedom Come All Ye was suggested by the Scottish nationalists as an anthem, but Henderson disapproved as he wanted Scotland to be internationalist, not narrowly nationalist. Perhaps a future anthem should reflect internationalism more than nationalism.John MorganTullibody, Clackmannanshire  Rory Scothorne has missed an obvious candidate. Written by Robert Burns to a very singable tune, the last verse of A Man’s a Man For A’ That avoids the taint of anti-English sentiment. It stands alone as one verse (though the rest of the poem is worth knowing) and is undeniably forward-looking. The last two lines sum up what we should all strive for: “That man to man, the world o’er / Shall brothers be…”Eli CurrieEdinburgh  Surely the best suggestion is The Ball of Kirriemuir (AKA Four and Twenty Virgins). I am sure Scottish MSPs would happily link arms and bellow it out to the Queen. Scotland could become the only country whose national anthem could not be televised before the watershed.Martin GuhaBlackheath, London  Reading Rory Scothorne as an Englishman who lived in Scotland for 20 years and has often thought about this, Hamish Henderson’s song is a good choice. But may I suggest Rolling Home to Caledonia, as sung by the Whistlebinkies in 1988.

4/16/2022,"Michael Marmot (Studying health inequalities has been my life’s work. What’s about to happen in the UK is unprecedented, 9 April) raises a grim spectre for the health of the poverty-stricken in the UK. However, the warning given in his article is not unprecedented, even if the dire consequences are. Forty-two years ago, the Black report on inequalities in health found that there were differences in mortality rates across the social groups, with those in lower social groups suffering higher rates of mortality. It also found inequalities in access to health services, with low rates of uptake by the working classes to preventive services in particular. It was ready for release by the then Labour government in early 1979, but sat on by the succeeding Tory government until August 1980. The only hope in the 42 years since then was Gordon Brown’s 1998 Sure Start programme, which aimed to tackle poverty and health by trying to give children the best possible start in life. I’d like to hear what Marmot feels are the reasons why the public psyche is largely oblivious to the poverty and health cause and effect. Is it the grip of illiberal “liberal” capitalism or the fact that Tory governments just have no idea how people actually live?Jonathan HauxwellCrosshills, North Yorkshire  Michael Marmot’s account of the increasing levels of inequality and poverty in this country is an indictment of all our politicians for failing to give priority to the most needy in our society. I think of the passage in St Matthew’s gospel in which Jesus praises those who feed the hungry, welcome the stranger, clothe the naked, care for the sick and comfort the prisoner: “as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me”. Our duty is clear, as is the duty of our politicians, who should be judged on one thing above all others, their treatment of “the least” in our society. I can think of no better manifesto promise than a commitment to “the least”, the people Marmot characterises as unable to meet their basic needs.Peter PhilpottPatrick Brompton, North Yorkshire  Michael Marmot’s hard-hitting and accurate description of the impact of poverty on both mental and physical health is essential reading, especially for politicians, policymakers and clinicians. He emphasises that “the essentials of life include whatever is necessary to take your place in public without shame”. A lack of essentials leads to poorer mental health, and this applies to all citizens, including people with learning disabilities, asylum seekers and other excluded groups. Marmot makes a good case for universal basic services. In wealthy Britain, no one should be dependent on charity to live and to belong – isn’t this what levelling up should be about?Sheila HollinsFounder and chair, Beyond Words  Michael Marmot says that scarcity “reduces intellectual bandwidth”. That in turn leads people to make bad choices. Another terrifying thing about the times that we live in is that the bad choices include not voting or – worse, if possible – voting Conservative, for the very same people who created the poverty that you suffer from and who will make it worse.Jeremy CushingTaddyforde, Exeter  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/16/2022,"Your article (Shelf-promotion: the art of furnishing rooms with books you haven’t read, 8 April) reminded me that Myles na gCopaleen (AKA Flann O’Brien), who wrote for the Irish Times, spotted this trend a long time ago and suggested a service that might provide a useful income for today’s impoverished students. He’d visited the house of a newly married friend – “a man of great wealth and vulgarity” – who’d just “paid some rascally middleman” to stuff his library full of books as “some savage faculty for observation” had told him that respectable people had lots of books. The trouble was that these books were all pristine, betraying the philistine owner. That led Myles to suggest a book-handling service: the man obviously needed “a person who will maul the books”. In fact, there could be several degrees of book-handling, from the low-cost (four leaves in each to be dog-eared, and a tram ticket, cloak-room docket or other suitable bookmark inserted), to the high-end, which would have pencilled marginalia added (“Yes, but cf Homer, Od, iii, 151”; “I remember poor Joyce saying the very same thing to me”; and even forged messages of gratitude from the author – “From your devoted friend and follower, K Marx”).Karin BarryLondon  What a useful article, particularly for those of us with too many books looking for a home.

As Nick Rennison says in his book 1922, for poetry lovers “the great event” of October that year was the publication of AE Housman’s Last Poems. Twenty-six years after the appearance of A Shropshire Lad, the new collection attracted widespread critical acclaim. For JC Squire, writing in the Observer, the 41 poems contained “scarcely a line which is not perfectly musical, scarcely a word which is not accurate and necessary”. Sir Andrew Motion, in his foreword to the Housman Society’s commemorative edition, identifies themes shared with the modernists, but which are also revealed in the “self-conscious beauty” of both phrase and cadence.

The original family name was Chaika (“Seagull”) before it was changed to the more noble-sounding Chaikovsky by the composer’s grandfather, who eventually moved to Russia. Tchaikovsky’s Ukrainian origins were hardly celebrated by the Soviets nor today’s Russians. On 2 April, Russian missiles were blasted at the city of Kremenchuk, the birthplace of Pyotr Ilyich’s great-grandfather, Fedor Chaika, a Cossack who served in the Zaporozhian army.

4/16/2022,"Pep Guardiola has advised his players to “sleep, sleep, sleep” before Manchester City’s FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Saturday. The game will be City’s second against Jürgen Klopp’s team in seven days after Sunday’s Premier League draw and their third game of the week after Wednesday’s attritional draw at Atlético Madrid. Although Guardiola would prefer a less congested schedule, he has no complaints about City competing on all fronts at the defining end of the campaign. “It happens for one reason: because we’re fighting for all the titles,” he said. “That is good news; I’m saying that with a big smile, it’s not that I am grumpy. I’m so happy to live that. It’s not an ideal situation but where in this world is an ideal situation? “Look what happens two, three hours away from here [the Russia-Ukraine war]. So for tomorrow I say to my players: ‘Have good food, sleep a lot, take a nap. Sleep, sleep, sleep – a lot of hours, as many hours as possible, then good food and tomorrow at 3.30 we will be there [for the kick-off].” Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker are serious doubts after respective foot and ankle injuries they sustained in Madrid. “They didn’t train today,” Guardiola said. “We’ll see tomorrow but apparently it’d be so [too] close after what happened on Wednesday. He [Walker] had a big twist, and he is getting better but we will see the process for the next hours and next days for the next games.” Zack Steffen has been City’s domestic cup goalkeeper in place of Ederson, the club’s No 1. Guardiola has not decided whether the American will start against Liverpool. “I am going to think about it,” he said. “We still have until training tonight [Friday] and then speaking with the doctors and physios regarding the condition of many players. Tonight or tomorrow morning I’ll decide but of course in the FA Cup normally we play Zack.” This is City’s fifth FA Cup semi-final under Guardiola, though they have reached only one final. “This is an incredible achievement and shows our consistency,” he said. “But we didn’t perform well in these semi-final games [that were lost]. Hopefully we can perform a little bit better.

4/16/2022,"Russia sent a formal warning to the US not to send more arms to Ukraine or it could face “unpredictable consequences”, it has been reported. According to the Washington Post, Moscow sent a diplomatic note, a démarche, warning that US and Nato deliveries of the “most sensitive” weapons systems to Ukraine were “adding fuel” to the conflict there and could bring “unpredictable consequences”. A spokesperson said the state department ddid not confirm any diplomatic correspondence as a matter of course, and made clear that the US would continue to send arms to Ukraine. “What we can confirm is that, along with allies and partners, we are providing Ukraine with billions of dollars worth of security assistance, which our Ukrainian partners are using to extraordinary effect to defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked aggression and horrific acts of violence,” the spokesperson said. The Russian embassy in Ukraine did not respond to a request for comment. The US is preparing to send the latest $800m (£610m) tranche of military aid to Ukraine, bringing to $2.6bn the total since the start of the war. The Biden administration has also made clear that it was sending increasingly heavy and sophisticated equipment, including helicopters, aerial and marine drones, and long-range 155mm howitzers, while training Ukrainian soldiers in their use. The US is also sending additional anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles of the sort that have contributed to the war effort so far in Ukraine. The Ukrainians claim to have sunk the Russian Black Sea fleet flagship Moskva on Thursday using Ukrainian-developed Neptune missiles. The UK has promised to send more anti-ship missiles to replenish stockpiles.

4/16/2022,"It’s strange that the silly but mostly tolerable horror Choose or Die was an acquisition rather than a homegrown Netflix original given how much it seems algorithmically modeled for the notoriously formula-obsessed platform. It stars Asa Butterfield, an in-house star thanks to the success of Sex Education. It’s contemporary-set but baked in 80s nostalgia, something that also inspires the aesthetic of the aforementioned comedy series as well as the entirety of long-running hit Stranger Things. It also focuses on a cursed video game, making it a close cousin to the streamer’s interactive Black Mirror hit Bandersnatch. It’s a film destined to live its days in the “if you like” container. It’ll probably fare well there as fans of the above might find just about enough here to play with although they might, like me, be a little surprised at just how nasty this quickie horror is, made with closer attention to the gore quotient than any level of creativity. It’s part of the cursed tech subgenre that expanded after the success of Gore Verbinski’s surprisingly effective remake of Ringu, later retitled The Ring. It led to more similarly plotted Asian horror remakes, such as One Missed Call, Pulse and Shutter, and then also a string of US copycats, like Feardotcom, Unfriended and Stay Alive, a 2006 flop that saw a group of teens playing a deadly video game. We’re in similar, yet mildly more proficient, territory here with the discovery of a dusty 80s game called CURS>R (the film’s original title), that coerces players into making genuine life-or-death decisions. It’s found by 80s-obsessive Isaac (Butterfield), compelled by the idea that the $125,000 prize money might still lay unclaimed and further seduced by the recorded voice of Freddy Krueger himself, Robert Englund, at the end of the hotline. His friend, and object of affection, Kayla (relative newcomer Iola Evans) is less convinced but living on the breadline has her willing to take a chance, struggling to get by on a measly cleaner’s wage. And so it begins. What’s vaguely refreshing about this admittedly rather ho-hum set-up is that Kayla isn’t the hands-on-hips scold she might have been in another more cliche version of this story but the one who boots up the game herself to play. She’s as tech-savvy as Isaac and the film’s main, plot-propelling protagonist. The first encounter with the game sees Kayla playing in an empty diner, forced to watch a flirty waitress eat glass in front of her. It’s a bracingly nasty scene, automatically cluing us into the torture porn-adjacent territory we’re in, far from what we might have expected (there’s a whiff of the far superior Escape Room films here which exist firmly in the world of PG-13). But while the gore is impressively visceral and well-realised, the rest of it is a few steps behind. It’s an overwhelmingly British film, shot in London with local actors (there’s a bookending appearance from Eddie Marsan while soap stalwart Angela Griffin also pops up), that’s bizarrely set in an unnamed US city, forcing everyone into at times laughably shoddy Ay-meh-reek-uhn accents. It’s a baffling misstep, clearly made for commercial reasons, that adds a layer of amateurishness to what’s otherwise a solidly directed first feature for Brit Toby Meakins. He doesn’t quite take enough advantage of his reality-shifting game sequences (the Englund voice cameo serves to remind us just how wild Wes Craven made those nightmares way back when) but it’s a cut above the average Netflix genre guff. The script, from TV writer Simon Allen, acts as mostly just pedestrian framework for the game scenes, which thankfully do arrive quite often. The specifics of the plot make little to no real sense, even in the moment, but that won’t much matter to the sleepover crowd, who’ll be too distracted by the nasty noise of it all. Don’t understand how a malevolent curse ties to game code? Who cares, here’s a teenager eating his arm! In a choice between coherence and cruelty, it’s an easy win.

4/16/2022,"Joe Root called time on his five-year tenure as Test captain on Friday as English cricket undergoes a leadership reshuffle that is expected to see Rob Key take over as managing director of the men’s team. Key, the former Kent captain who has worked as a commentator for Sky since his retirement from playing in 2015, is understood to be in advanced negotiations for the role made vacant by the sacking of Ashley Giles in February, with an announcement tipped to follow the Easter bank holiday. And one of the first jobs in his in-tray will be to decide on a new Test captain for the three-match series against New Zealand in June – with Ben Stokes the favourite – after Root took time out to consider last month’s 1-0 defeat to West Indies plus a run of just one victory in his last 17 outings as captain. Root said: “After returning from the Caribbean tour and having time to reflect, I have decided to step down as England men’s Test captain. It has been the most challenging decision I have had to make in my career but having discussed this with my family and those closest to me; I know the timing is right. “I am immensely proud to have captained my country and will look back on the past five years with enormous pride. It has been an honour to have done the job and to have been a custodian of what is the pinnacle of English cricket. I have loved leading my country, but recently it’s hit home how much of a toll it has taken on me and the impact it has had on me away from the game.” Root, 31, steps down after 64 Tests in charge, 27 victories and 26 defeats – all three of which are records for an England captain – and will return to the ranks as a batter. Jimmy Anderson, writing on Instagram, expressed his gratitude and added: “I can’t wait to see him back out in the middle where I’m certain he’ll cement himself as one of the all-time greats.” Stokes, the current vice-captain, appears the likeliest successor in a thin field and led the side for a home Test in 2020 when Root was on paternity leave. It would be a huge challenge, however, both as an all-format all-rounder and a player who last summer took time out for mental health reasons. This is something Key – or a surprise late candidate from left field – will have to consider when making his choice. The 42-year-old, who won 15 Test caps between 2002 and 2005, would also have to appoint a new head coach after Chris Silverwood, like Giles, paid the price for England’s 4-0 Ashes defeat in Australia. It may well be that given a bulging fixture schedule, and a 2022-23 winter that sees Test and white-ball tours overlap, separate head coaches for the two men’s teams are required. Key, in his role as a pundit, has previously advocated such a split but for performance reasons, chiefly. Speaking on Sky’s Cricket podcast in February, Key said: “I would split the coaching. Not because it’s a lot of work but because it’s two very different teams at two different times. The [white-ball] team could do with a facilitator coach who can just keep delivering what they’re doing but challenge them. The Test team needs a completely different style of coach – a driver of culture and environment. The biggest thing is the mentality, which I think has been very poor.” Key’s appointment would also see England likely move on from Anderson and Stuart Broad, having supported the decision made by Strauss, the interim managing director, to leave the pair at home during the recent Caribbean tour. He is in favour of giving them a farewell in front of their home supporters this summer but believes their ongoing presence in the team would block others. “Do they get in the team on merit? Absolutely,” Key said. “Do I think they’ll be the ones to take us into this new era and get us to No 1 in the world? No I don’t. They can’t help if they’re monopolising the new ball. [But] they certainly deserve a proper send-off.” Strauss is overseeing the recruitment process for the managing director of men’s cricket but had scant few candidates to assess, with Marcus North, Ed Smith and Mike Hesson, the former New Zealand head coach, among those to turn down the opportunity to further their initial conversations over the role. Key, though lacking in direct experience, had an all-encompassing role during his nine seasons as Kent captain, often dealing with contract negotiations, and has also sat on the England and Wales Cricket Board’s cricket committee. The former batter is an original thinker on the game and, though popular among the current generation of England cricketers, has stated he would crack down on the player power that previously led to some missing Test matches to feature in the Indian Premier League and saw last winter’s tour of Pakistan cancelled.",Sport/Sport,Rob Key ready to lead England reshuffle after Root resigns as Test captain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/joe-root-resigns-as-england-test-cricket-captain-after-torrid-run
4/16/2022,"As rabbis and members of the British Jewish community, we are utterly appalled by the government’s inhumane plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for offshore processing. Such a policy flies in the face of Jewish values, and would be a cruel, moral failure to those in urgent need of protections. It is particularly disturbing that such plans have been announced shortly before our community celebrates Passover, a festival where Jews recall our journey to safety from Egypt. As we prepare to read the story of Exodus, it is deeply unsettling that the government is seeking to deprive the opportunity of freedom to those fleeing modern-day tyrants. Such proposals also bring to mind unpleasant memories of the overseas internment of Jewish refugees in the second world war. This policy was a grave error: we urge the government to learn from this historic mistake, uphold international refugee law and ensure all those seeking safety in the UK are treated with dignity and respect. If the government is serious about preventing small boat crossings, it should act to introduce safe and accessible routes to sanctuary in the UK. Seeking to replicate Australia’s disastrous offshoring system in Rwanda, a country frequently condemned for its appalling human rights record, would be a terrible abdication of responsibility. We urge the government to instead stand up, fulfil its moral duty, and protect, not punish, those fleeing conflict and persecution.Dr Edie Friedman Executive director, the Jewish Council for Racial Equality, Rabbi David Mason Muswell Hill synagogue, Rabbi Dr Jackie Tabick Reform Judaism, Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg Senior rabbi, Masorti Judaism, Rabbi Alexandra Wright Senior rabbi, Liberal Jewish synagogue",News/World news,Plans to offshore asylum seekers to Rwanda are cruel and disturbing | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/plans-to-offshore-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda-are-cruel-and-disturbing
4/16/2022,"Hugh Grant is leading a renewed attempt to prove phone hacking took place at the Sun, even as Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper continues to maintain no illegality took place there. The actor has followed Paul Gascoigne and Sienna Miller in bringing a so-called “Sun-only” phone-hacking claim, specifically alleging that illegality took place at the daily tabloid in the 2000s. Rebekah Brooks, the current chief executive of Murdoch’s News UK business, was editor of the Sun during the period in question. Murdoch’s News UK company has already paid out millions of pounds to settle claims from the likes of Miller and Gascoigne about the alleged activities of Sun journalists, ensuring the accusations are not heard at trial. “I suspect it is to some degree damage limitation,” said Nathan Sparkes, the chief executive of Hacked Off, which campaigns for tougher press regulation. “In the case of the Sun it is most likely because they are trying to avoid a full-blown court case in which lots of other details could emerge, which they don’t want coming up.” More such cases are expected in future, presenting a growing headache for Murdoch’s business as it attempts to move on from the phone-hacking era and instead focus on the imminent launch of its Piers Morgan-fronted news channel, talkTV. Morgan has himself faced ongoing accusations – which he strenuously denies – that he must have known about the practice while editor of the Daily Mirror in the 2000s. Hugh Grant’s case is awkward for News UK because the company has always said its illegal activity took place exclusively at the News of the World, the Sunday outlet it closed down in 2011 after 168 years. This has left the Sun in the unusual position of maintaining that it did not hack phones, while at the same time choosing to pay out enormous sums in damages and legal fees – albeit without any admission of wrongdoing – to people who claim otherwise. The ongoing cost of the legal action has hit the value of the Sun as a business and left it nursing enormous financial losses. The company recently failed in an attempt to shut down the ongoing legal process that makes it relatively easy for alleged phone-hacking victims to bring claims. With thousands more potential victims waiting in the wings, the legal action relating to phone hacking could now stretch into a third decade – potentially adding to the hundreds of millions of pounds that have already been paid out by Murdoch’s company. Among the individuals who have brought fresh phone-hacking claims against the company in recent weeks are the government minister Zac Goldsmith, his mother, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, the football manager Alan Pardew, the former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, the Spice Girl Mel B, Atomic Kitten’s Liz McClarnon, the actors Gillian Anderson and Kate Winslet, the boxer Joe Calzaghe and the Steps singer Lisa Scott-Lee. Grant, who settled a phone-hacking case against the News of the World in 2012, is unusual in being one of a relatively small group of people who can bring a separate claim specifically against the Sun. In a complicated legal arrangement, the still-publishing Sun and the defunct News of the World are owned by the same parent company, which means it can settle cases against the latter on the condition that victims cannot bring a separate claim against the former. But individuals who secured some of the first phone-hacking settlements in the early 2010s – such as Grant – were not asked to agree to such terms. This allows them to file a second case against the Sun. Reach, the current owner of the Daily Mirror, is also facing lengthy and ongoing legal claims for historical phone-hacking offences at its tabloid newspapers. Prince Harry also has a case working its way through the courts alleging wrongdoing at the Sun, the News of the World and the publisher of the Mirror. Sparkes, whose organisation is pushing for a public inquiry into the relationship between the media and the police, said: “The background of hacking is not only the practice itself but also the cover-up and the culture that enabled it to happen. It may have happened a long time ago but there’s no evidence the culture has fundamentally changed.” News UK has been approached for comment.",News/Media,Hugh Grant brings phone-hacking claim against the Sun,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/15/hugh-grant-brings-phone-hacking-claim-against-the-sun
4/16/2022,"In a city of innovation and a country considered the Silicon Valley of Europe, it was James Maddison who electrified Leicester City’s path to a first European semi-final, his equaliser sparking a comeback victory on a memorable night in Eindhoven, but he was not the only one to impress. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, the homegrown midfielder who spent last season on loan at Luton, was name-checked by the PSV manager, Roger Schmidt, as Leicester’s outstanding talent and the full-back Ricardo Pereira slotted in the winning goal two minutes from time to tee up a Europa Conference League tie against Roma. Then there was Wesley Fofana, whose performance was so typically peerless, quietly hoovering up in defence and pouring cold water on PSV attacks, it has become the norm. But it would be wrong to gloss over Fofana’s abundant class. The defender, who turned 21 at the end of last year, returned to first-team action only last month in the previous round, scoring at Rennes after seven months of rehabilitation from a broken leg and damaged ankle ligaments, some of which he spent building strength in the sandpit at Leicester’s sprawling 185-acre Seagrave training base. Fofana used his pace to get teammates out of trouble and plays with a maturity that belies his years. After Philipp Max got in down the left flank, Fofana rushed in to extinguish the danger before dragging his teammates up the pitch, and seconds before Maddison equalised he curtailed a PSV attack. On the hour, he cleanly raked the ball clear of Cody Gakpo and earlier ate up ground to block Eran Zahavi’s route to goal. The good news for Leicester is that Fofana, who harbours ambitions to play for France, recently signed a new five-year contract. “His anticipation as a defender is top – he just has an in-built brain for the game, his reading of the game is great,” said Brendan Rodgers. “With all due respect, he has no respect in terms of [when he is] on the field. He defends forward, he is aggressive and in my experience working with world-class players, they have got great human qualities outside of the field but when they’re on there, they’re super-aggressive and that’s exactly what he is.” After the game, the Leicester chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, who took in the game alongside his brother and vice-chairman, Apichet, and the director of football, Jon Rudkin, made his way to the dressing room to congratulate the players. Maddison reserved special praise for Fofana, who is fasting as he observes Ramadan. “I said to him at the end: ‘It takes a big heart to do that, that lung-busting run back on the counterattack, to put in the challenge, win the foul, all while he’s fasting; he deserves credit for that,” Maddison said. “He hasn’t eaten or drank all day, played a full 90 minutes … he was letting us attack, shutting down counterattacks.” Rodgers praised his players for not resorting to “playing frightened football” when they trailed and no one embodied that better than Fofana, who exhibited composure in a frenetic game alongside his sidekick Jonny Evans, another player welcomed back from injury. Maddison put in the kind of performance that will surely edge him closer to an England recall and his 14th goal of the season means Harry Kane and Tammy Abraham are the only Englishmen to have outscored him this campaign. At a time when the former key Leicester pillar Harry Maguire is enduring a rough ride at Manchester United, Fofana continues to exude calm. His performances for Saint-Étienne against Neymar and Kylian Mbappé in the French Cup convinced Leicester to make their move and the £30m they paid 18 months ago, which Rodgers predicted would prove a bargain, is beginning to look a real snip. “He is unbelievable,” the Leicester manager said. “He is a very, very talented young player. You think again, he hasn’t eaten all day … it was only midway through the game that he started to get some food on. He is a phenomenal talent and one that will go right to the very top of the game.”",Sport/Football,‘He is unbelievable’: cool Fofana fires Leicester’s hopes while fasting,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/wesley-fofana-fires-leicester-hopes-while-fasting-rodgers
4/16/2022,"After decades struggling with failing sewage infrastructure, the majority-Black city of Mount Vernon, New York, is getting a significant funding package aimed at preventing unsanitary backups in homes and stopping pollution from leaking into local rivers. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, announced on Friday that the state will dedicate $150m toward projects that include repairing and replacing the city’s collapsing sewage pipes. Some of the funding is set aside for families affected by the sewage failures. It would also help bring the city into compliance with federal court orders to stop raw sewage from pouring into the Bronx and Hutchinson rivers, which flow south into New York City’s Bronx borough, as the Guardian reported last year. “In too many communities of color like Mount Vernon, critical water infrastructure has been left to fall into disrepair, but today we are setting an example for the nation by advancing environmental justice, improving quality of life for residents, and addressing decades of disinvestment,” Hochul said in a statement. Mount Vernon, which is in Westchester county and just a 30-minute train ride from Grand Central Station in Manhattan, is one of America’s most extreme examples of what happens when infrastructure problems fester. The city sits atop a century-old network of wastewater pipes meant for a population much smaller than today’s 74,000 residents. Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard previously told the Guardian that the city has lacked the funding to revamp its infrastructure and has treated its sewage pipes like a “hot potato passed from administration to administration”. This city has far more Black residents – and far lower household incomes – than the rest of Westchester county. The Biden administration has pointed to such communities as places that would benefit from huge investments in infrastructure. Maintenance problems in Mount Vernon began to spiral out of control in recent years. By 2020, when Patterson-Howard took office, at least 1,000 families were at risk of sewage backups in their houses, and pipes were collapsing all over town – faster than the city’s sewer crew could keep up. The federal government and the state had also sued the city, ordering it to figure out how to stop sewage from polluting local waterways. Officials in town estimated that overhauling the sewers might require between $100m and $200m – a sum they said the city could not meet on its own. Mount Vernon’s public works commissioner, Damani Bush, previously said reporting by the Guardian had “set fire” to the case, helping unite stakeholders interested in solving the sanitation problems. Patterson-Howard worked with environmental authorities and lawmakers to secure the new funding for her city’s wastewater network. “Rebuilding our infrastructure is critical to the economic, social and physical health of the community,” she said in a statement. The initiative also sets aside $7m to fix one of the city’s most visible emergencies, located along the densely populated Third Street corridor. With pipes buried too deep to reach with run-of-the-mill municipal equipment, this pain-point in the city’s network no longer allows sewage to flow. The city placed a bypass pump the size of a small car in the middle of the busy street, to force human waste through the pipes. The fix was meant to be temporary. More than a year later, it’s still pumping. A pilot program will launch as part of a new initiative that will let some households get resiliency upgrades to their pipes. Several residents in Mount Vernon told the Guardian that their basements or garages flood with foul-smelling sludge during rainy weather. The city has previously received smaller funding packages to address its sanitation problems, including a $10m grant earlier this year to target river pollution.",News/US news,Majority-Black city gets $150m to fix sewage crisis from New York state,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/15/mount-vernon-sewage-funding-majority-black-city-new-york
4/16/2022,"The Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, has derided the Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, for owning vast media platforms as Musk himself attempts to buy the vast media platform Twitter. Talking at a Ted conference in Vancouver, Musk accused Zuckerberg of having too much control over public debate given his ownership of Meta, which is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media sites. “As for media sort of ownership, I mean, you’ve got Mark Zuckerberg owning Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, and with a share ownership structure that will have Mark Zuckerberg XIV still controlling those entities,” said Musk, seemingly referring to King Louis XIV, the “Sun King” whose wealth and power were legendarily vast. “We won’t have that at Twitter,” added Musk, who is currently bidding to buy Twitter for more than $40bn after failing to join their board of directors this week. Of his potential ownership, Musk has said that he wants to keep the maximum number of shareholders. He currently owns 9.1% of Twitter. According to the Daily Mail, Musk also said he wants to keep Twitter’s algorithm open-source and transparent, as well as allow the site to err on the side of free speech versus censorship. Musk added that Twitter could act as an “inclusive arena for free speech”. News of Musk’s potential Twitter ownership has not gone over well with many Twitter employees. As reported by the Washington Post, while Twitter is a fairly liberal workplace, Musk has frequently caught flak for mocking gender pronouns and sharing Covid-19 misinformation. Tesla has also faced multiple lawsuits for racial discrimination and sexual harassment. “Musk taking over Twitter would be a nightmare for many employees that have worked under the [former Twitter CEO] Dorsey and Twitter regime,” said Daniel Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, to the Post.",News/Technology,"Zuckerberg has too much social media power, says wannabe Twitter boss Musk",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/15/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-sun-king-louis-xiv
