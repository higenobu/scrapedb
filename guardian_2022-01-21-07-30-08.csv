1/21/2022,"Snapchat has announced new efforts to combat drug dealing on the platform, changes that come as drug-related deaths among US high school and college-aged youth are exploding. The company said it has improved automated drug detection systems, enhanced partnerships with law enforcement, and launched a new portal educating users on the dangers of drugs.  “Our position on this has always been clear: we have absolutely zero tolerance for drug dealing on Snapchat,” the company said in a blog post announcing the move this week. “We have a unique opportunity to use our voice, technology and resources to help address this scourge, which threatens the lives of our community members.” The new steps come after the CDC warned in late 2021 of a major spike of drug overdoses driven by fentanyl, with young people being the most impacted. The cheap, synthetic opioid is up to 100 times more potent than heroin and is often mixed into counterfeit pills that young people buy on social media, mistaking them for pharmaceutical drugs. Fentanyl fatalities rose to more than 93,000 in 2020, a 32% increase from 2019. According to a recent Guardian analysis of federal data, youth under 24 have been the hardest hit, with drug deaths up by 50% in that age group. “Every drug you try now is a game of Russian roulette,” Shabbir Safdar, director of the Partnership for Safe Medicines, a non-profit fighting pharmaceutical counterfeits, previously told the Guardian. Pills labelled as Oxycontin, Percocet, Xanax or Adderall are readily available on platforms like Snapchat, Instagram and Craigslist, studies have shown. A recent report from the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) found that Instagram offers an instant “drug pipeline” for kids that enabled them to find drugs with just a few clicks. Snapchat said it increased its proactive detection of drug sales by 390% in the past year, increasing them by 50% in the last quarter alone. It added that when its systems detect drug dealing activity, the account is promptly banned and the creator blocked from creating new accounts on Snapchat. The company said it has increased collaborations with law enforcement and improved response times to law enforcement inquiries by 85% over the past year. In its blog post, Snap said it is working with experts to continually update the list of slang and drug-related terms blocked from search results on Snapchat. Other platforms should also take measures to put a stop to the massive rise in online drug dealing, said Christine Elgersma, a senior editor at children’s safety non-profit Common Sense Media. “This is not just a Snapchat problem,” she said. Indeed, Instagram executive Adam Mosseri faced questions about the issue in a 2021 congressional hearing. “Why are children’s accounts even allowed to search for drug content to begin with, much less allowed to do so in a way that leads them to a drug dealer in two clicks?” asked the Republican senator Mike Lee of Utah. “Accounts selling drugs or any other regulated goods are not allowed on the platform,” said Mosseri. Instagram has previously said said it uses technology to proactively take down a huge number of drug-related posts. Parents of children who died of fentanyl overdoses previously shared with the Guardian screenshots of Snapchat accounts selling pills. One woman, Perla Mendoza, said her 20-year-old son died in September 2020 after buying fake Xanax. “It was one deadly pill that was strong enough to kill four adults,” said Mendoza, who hopes that other parents will get a chance to warn their children before it’s too late. “I feel like a lot of parents are like: ‘My kids aren’t into that.’ Well, neither was mine,” she said. “But that’s what kids are getting.” Erin McCormick contributed reporting",News/Technology,Snapchat fights drug dealing on app amid surge in youth overdose deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/snapchat-steps-combat-drug-dealing-on-platform
1/21/2022,"Comments by Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell regarding Black voters in the US have gone viral online and sparked widespread outrage.  The Kentucky Republican was speaking after Republican senators once again blocked Democrats’ voting rights legislation on Capitol Hill on Wednesday evening. Speaking to reporters after the bill failed and the Senate rejected a change to the filibuster rule that could facilitate its passage, McConnell was asked for his message to voters in minority communities who are concerned that voting restrictions being enacted in many states will keep them from the ballot box without new federal laws. “The concern is misplaced, because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans,” McConnell said. In fact, studies indicate that voting restrictions, like those passed by 19 states in the past year, disproportionately impact voters of color. Democratic Illinois congressman Bobby Rush swiftly called out McConnell’s comment, saying in a tweet: “African Americans ARE Americans. #MitchPlease” One of Rush’s Democratic colleagues, Diana DeGette of Colorado, echoed that assessment, describing McConnell’s comment as “disgusting”. “African-American voters ARE AMERICANS & to suggest otherwise is about as racist as it gets,” DeGette said in a tweet. African Americans ARE Americans. #MitchPlease https://t.co/N3dSsQ9Jqn pic.twitter.com/SRnTTVJdJ4 Former Kentucky state senator Charles Booker, who is campaigning for the US senate against Republican Rand Paul, tweeted: “I am no less American than Mitch McConnell” and also said: “I need you to understand that this is who Mitch McConnell is. Being Black doesn’t make you less of an American, no matter what this craven man thinks.” Pastor and activist Talbert Swan quipped that he “can’t qwhite put my finger on” what distinction McConnell might be drawing, tweeting: “I wonder what’s the difference he sees between ‘African-American voters’ and ‘Americans.’” And Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, argued that McConnell’s words were not a slip of the tongue but were instead an accurate reflection of the Republican party’s mindset toward Black voters. “Mitch McConnell’s comments suggesting African Americans aren’t fully American wasn’t a Freudian slip – it was a dog whistle. The same one he has blown for years,” Kenyatta said.

1/21/2022,"Now you see him, now you don’t. Liverpool surged into the final of the Carabao Cup on a chilly evening in north London, and will face Chelsea at Wembley at the end of February. By then they will almost certainly have Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané to call on again, and so Diogo Jota will simply be able to retreat once more into the background, which is how you suspect he likes it. Jota is the sort of player you tend not to notice until the critical moment, which is exactly how he managed to hurt Arsenal here. Jota popped up with an early goal to settle Liverpool’s nerves and a second late on to settle them again, both expertly assisted by Trent Alexander-Arnold. In between, however, the second leg of this semi-final was fiercely and evenly contested, as Arsenal threw everything at their last chance of a trophy in 2022 and Jürgen Klopp’s side mustered all their street-fighting experience to hold them at bay.  Ultimately Arsenal were just a little blunt when it mattered most. Ben White should have done better for the second goal. Alexander Lacazette squandered perhaps Arsenal’s best chance. And the right-back Takehiro Tomiyasu was rushed back from injury and given a torrid evening by Jota on a dewy, slippery surface. Here, as against Brentford at the weekend, Jota started on the left. This is probably his best role: it allows him to get the ball in space, use his quick feet to cut inside and get shots away through heavy traffic. Not that there was very much traffic to speak of as he advanced on Aaron Ramsdale in the 19th minute to score the first goal of the tie. A gorgeous, flowing move had taken Liverpool the length of the field, from deep in their own territory to the edge of the penalty area, and left Arsenal temporarily short on numbers. This is where Jota is in his element. Prowling, shuffling, teasing Tomiyasu and eventually turning him inside out, he drifted inside and rolled a shot past Ramsdale with all the measured delicacy of a red into the middle pocket. And having weathered an early spell of Arsenal pressure, with Lacazette hitting the bar and Gabriel Martinelli getting the better of Alexander-Arnold, it felt like a crucial goal: the point at which Arsenal’s pretty buildup play collided with Liverpool’s superior cutting edge. So it proved in a tense, tactical first half during which Liverpool gradually began to draw the sting from Arsenal. On the touchline Mikel Arteta was directing Emile Smith Rowe like an air-traffic controller, urging him forward to press Liverpool high, ordering him back into midfield to make himself available for a pass. But Liverpool were winning the midfield battle. Curtis Jones was having a fine game, Fabinho pulled off a brilliant slide tackle to deny Martinelli when he was about to shoot, and with Jordan Henderson plugging the gaps Liverpool looked more and more secure as the half went on. Martinelli was still an occasional menace, and Martin Ødegaard brought the crowd to their feet with a couple of sumptuous passes from deep in his own half. But by and large Liverpool were able to keep them at arm’s length, and as the teams disappeared down the tunnel Arsenal badly needed to supplement their style with a little substance. The crowd raised the volume in the second half and so did Arsenal. Arteta camped out on the edge of his technical area and demanded more speed, more thrust, more running, more of everything. Smith Rowe buzzed up and down the pitch, desperately trying to make things happen. Lacazette had a good chance to equalise on 49 minutes but lifted the ball over the bar with Andy Robertson breathing down his neck. The problem, as ever at this threadbare time of year, for Arsenal was personnel. Even with the unexpected return of Thomas Partey from the Africa Cup of Nations, Arteta’s bench was painfully thin, with five academy youngsters and Eddie Nketiah the only attacking option. Only with 18 minutes to go did Arteta finally make his first changes. Meanwhile, Liverpool were still creating. Ibrahima Konaté hit a post with a header from an Alexander-Arnold corner. The 17-year-old winger Kaide Gordon, thrown into the biggest game of his life with a ringing endorsement from Klopp, sliced the ball over from 10 yards after another mesmerising run from Jota. The game was beginning to get spiky. Konaté, a half-time substitute, earned a yellow card for grappling Lacazette to the ground; Fabinho was probably lucky to escape the same fate for a scything challenge on Bukayo Saka. Alexander-Arnold was heckled for taking an age over a corner. But it was a measure of just how edgy Liverpool were becoming: for all their promise going forward, here was a team now fumbling and fidgeting for the final whistle. But with 14 minutes to go, Arsenal’s resistance was finally broken. The magnificent Fabinho won yet another ball in midfield. The inspired Alexander-Arnold lofted it hopefully forward again. And once again the brilliant Jota took a gamble, made the run, brought the ball down on his chest and lobbed it over Ramsdale to make the game safe. The final insult came when Partey was sent off for a high tackle on Fabinho: another suspension, another needless absence. But the wider battle had long since been lost.",Sport/Football,Diogo Jota double sinks Arsenal and sends Liverpool into Carabao Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/20/diogo-jota-double-sinks-arsenal-to-send-liverpool-through-to-carabao-cup-final
1/21/2022,"An American fugitive who is believed to have faked his own death to evade a rape charge has been arrested after skipping his extradition hearing in Scotland. Nicholas Rossi, who used several aliases while on the run from US authorities, was wanted by Interpol in connection with the alleged sexual assault in Utah in 2008.  The 34-year-old was arrested using the alias Arthur Knight at the Queen Elizabeth University hospital in Glasgow on 13 December last year after he almost died from Covid. He was expected to appear at Edinburgh sheriff court on Thursday for his extradition hearing but failed to attend and a warrant was issued for his arrest, the Mail Online reported. A Police Scotland spokesman said: “Officers arrested a 34-year-old man in the Woodlands area of Glasgow today, Thursday, 20 January 2022, in connection with an arrest warrant. He is due to appear at Edinburgh sheriff court on Friday.” David Leavitt, Utah county attorney, said: “We again express our gratitude to the law enforcement agencies for their diligent efforts in this matter to bring this individual to justice. “We do not comment on extradition proceedings or on the details of the work done in the course of this ongoing investigation.” Utah prosecutors previously said the alleged fugitive “fled the country to avoid prosecution” and “attempted to lead investigators and state legislators in other states to believe that he was deceased”. Rossi used many aliases while on the run, including Nicholas Alahverdian, Nicholas Alahverdian Rossi, Nicholas Edward Rossi, Nicholas Alahverdian-Rossi, Nick Alan, Nicholas Brown, Arthur Brown and Arthur Knight. It was reported by several media outlets in 2020 that Nicholas Alahverdian had died on 29 February 2020 from non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The website EverLoved.com claimed that his body was cremated, while his ashes were supposedly scattered at sea. Rossi reportedly used the alias while living in the US state of Rhode Island and was involved in local politics. The Utah rape charge came as part of a review of historical sex assault cases where DNA evidence kits had not been tested.",News/UK news,US man who faked death to evade rape charge rearrested after skipping hearing,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/us-man-who-faked-death-to-evade-charge-rearrested-after-skipping-hearing
