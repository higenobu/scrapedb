1/15/2022,"A CBS photographer captured stunning footage of looted packages along an LA railway line. The video appears to show the extent of theft from train containers near a Union Pacific terminal. Sources told CBS that Union Pacific container locks are easy to cut, making theft relatively simple. Thousands of empty, looted packages strewn along Los Angeles railway lines have been caught on video, highlighting what appears to be chronic theft from cargo containers. CBS Los Angeles photographer John Schreiber posted a series of videos in a Twitter thread on Thursday, saying he had headed to the tracks in the Lincoln Heights area of the city after hearing about thefts from trains on the local police scanner. At Lincoln Heights — a densely-populated area in central LA — train tracks converge on a Union Pacific (UP) terminal as well as a United Parcel Service (UPS) customer center, where trains unload their cargo. Schreiber estimated that at least one in five of the containers he saw on the tracks had been targeted, with doors open and locks cut. ""There's looted packages as far as the eye can see,"" he wrote. He reported having found packages from UPS and Amazon strewn across the tracks. Schreiber also found items like Epi Pens and COVID-19 test kits. Such items weren't considered valuable enough to take by thieves, CBS LA reported. Further videos from Schreiber's show the ground densely littered with cardboard and opened packages on either side of the tracks. UP agents have primary responsibility for policing the tracks and the areas alongside them. According to CBS LA, police don't respond to reports from the area unless UP asks for help, which they said it rarely does. LAPD's interactive crime map shows no reported thefts in the area. Unnamed sources also told CBSLA that the locks on Union Pacific containers are easy to cut, which alongside the lack of police involvement makes thefts more straightforward. Union Pacific did not immediately respond to Insider's out-of-hours request for comment, but told CBS LA it is ""very concerned"" about the increase in thefts. According to Schreiber, the area had been cleaned up by staff twice in the last three months, giving a sense of the sheer volume of thefts taking place. In its statement to CBS LA, UP said it has taken action against the problem. ""We have increased the number of Union Pacific special agents on patrol, and we have utilized and explored additional technologies to help us combat this criminal activity,"" it said. ""We also will continue to work with our local law enforcement partners and elected leaders.""

1/15/2022,"LUCKNOW, India (AP) — Tens of thousands of devout Hindus, led by heads of monasteries and ash-smeared ascetics, took a holy dip into the frigid waters of the Ganges River in northern India on Friday despite rising COVID-19 infections in the country. Hindu pilgrims congregated at the Sangam, the confluence of three rivers — the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati — in Prayagraj city, 200 km (124 miles) northeast of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh, to participate in the Magh Mela festival, one of the most sacred pilgrimages in Hinduism. They bathed in the Ganges waters, a ritual Hindus believe will wash away their sins and free them from the cycle of death and rebirth. A similar gathering at a Hindu festival last year in the Himalayan town of Haridwar, in neighboring Uttarakhand state, helped spread the delta variant that ravaged the country and made India one of the world’s worst-hit countries. Epidemiologists described the festival as a “superspreader event.” Coronavirus infections, fueled by the omicron variant, are rising fast throughout India. The country reported over 264,000 new infections on Friday but hospitalizations remain relatively low. Millions of Hindus are expected to throng the festival for the next 47 days. Many of them will stay on the banks of the Ganges for a month leading the life of an ascetic, with the belief they will receive salvation. It has raised concerns that pilgrims could get infected and take the virus back to their cities and villages in other parts of the country. Already, 77 policemen and 12 cleaning staff deployed for the event have tested positive for the virus. “This is going to be a superspreader. The government should not allow a congregation of people in such a large number because religious congregations in the past two years were found responsible for spreading the deadly virus all across the country,” said Utkarsh Mishra, a lawyer who has filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court asking that the festival be canceled. Mishra said only locals and heads of important Hindu monasteries should be allowed to take part in the ritual. Fearing a rise in infections, authorities in neighboring Uttarakhand state have already banned a similar gathering. Health experts earlier appealed for the festival to be canceled in Uttar Pradesh state too, but the government went ahead saying safety rules would be followed. Shesh Mani Pandey, a senior official in charge of the event, said only those who have taken two doses of the COVID-19 vaccines and have vaccination certificates would be allowed to join the ritualistic bathing. He said pilgrims will be allowed to enter the festival site after going through thermal scanning at the entry gates. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party say the festival has been allowed despite rising infections because the government isn’t willing to anger Hindus — they are the party’s biggest supporters — ahead of crucial state elections in Uttar Pradesh.
