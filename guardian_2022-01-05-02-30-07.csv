1/5/2022,"European gas prices have risen by more than 30% on Tuesday, adding to mounting concerns about the rising cost of heating a home, as supplies that usually come into Europe from Siberia continued to flow eastwards for the 15th day in a row. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied using Russia’s vast gas resources to turn the screw on Europe, after gas coming through the Yamal-Europe pipeline reversed direction three days before Christmas.  Data from the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border on Tuesday showed that the eastwards flow of gas has increased, with volumes hitting almost 9.9m kilowatt hours an hour (kWh/h), up from 5.8m previously. Eastbound volumes via the Yamal-Europe pipeline hit almost 9.9m kWh/h at the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border on Tuesday morning, the data showed, up from 5.8m previously. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said last month that Germany was reselling Russian gas to Poland and Ukraine rather than relieving price pressure, blaming German gas importers for the reversal of flows and soaring prices. The German government has declined to comment on Putin’s remarks. The benchmark Dutch front-month gas contract was up 32% at €95.20 (£79.40) a megawatt hour (MWh) by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, with the day-ahead contract up €29 at €95.50 MWh. The UK’s wholesale natural gas benchmark, the National Balancing Point, was up 38% at 236p a therm. Europe has been at the heart of an energy crisis since last year, when the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions put huge demands on depleted stocks of natural gas. Benchmark prices have more than quintupled since January 2021, squeezing consumers and companies and threatening the region’s economic recovery. In the UK, energy suppliers have warned that average gas bills could rise to more than £2,000 a year in April, when a cap on prices is revised upwards, piling pressure on the government to act to bring prices down amid a broader cost of living crisis. Expectations for colder weather in Europe were contributing to upward pressure on prices, but the low Russian gas flows were the main driver, a trader said. Separately, the Opec+ cartel of oil-producing nations resolved to press ahead with plans to increase output, signalling their optimism that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will have only a short-term impact on global growth. The 23-member alliance, led by Opec member Saudi Arabia and non-member Russia, stuck to a plan for a modest output increase of 400,000 barrels a day in February. The increase is part of a gradual unwinding of the 10m barrel-a-day production cuts made in 2020 as travel and transport slowed dramatically. Brent crude rose 50% last year as the global economy began to recover from the depths of 2020 and has rallied so far in the early days of 2022, trading 2% up above $80 (£59) on Tuesday. The US had urged Opec and its allies, led by Russia, to increase output to help keep a lid on prices in order not to dampen the nascent demand for fuel and slow that recovery. While the oil-producing nations opted for a slower increase than the US has called for, any rise in the volume of crude they pump indicates confidence that Omicron is not causing demand for fuel to plummet. In a technical report, Opec said the variant would be “mild and short-lived” and was upbeat about economic prospects. “This is in addition to a steady economic outlook in both the advanced and emerging economies,” the joint technical committee report said.",News/Business,Gas price hike of more than 30% stokes home bills fears for Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/gas-price-hike-of-more-than-30-stokes-home-bills-fears-for-europe
1/5/2022,"Lawyers for Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre, who has long accused the royal of sexual abuse, faced off in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, in his attempt to dismiss her civil lawsuit.  The arguments via videoconference came a day after the unsealing of a 2009 settlement between Giuffre and the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Reporters missed up to 15 minutes of arguments. A teleconference number only provided audio at 10.15am, after proceedings began. Giuffre, who accused Epstein and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell of sexual abuse and forcing her into sex with Prince Andrew at age 17 – an accusation he vehemently denies – received $500,000 in her settlement with the late financier. Using Giuffre’s maiden name, the settlement contains a provision releasing “second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia Roberts, including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. Andrew has contended that this clause bars Giuffre from suing him. He is not mentioned by name in the settlement agreement. On Tuesday, the judge, Lewis Kaplan, asked Andrew’s lawyer, Brad Brettler: “What is a ‘potential defendant’?” Brettler said: “A potential defendant is someone who could have been named in this lawsuit but was not. Prince Andrew could have been sued in the 2009 Florida action. He was not. Therefore, he was a potential defendant and releasee.” Later, Brettler said: “I don’t even understand how there could be any question as to whether ‘other potential defendants’ had a meaning. Clearly, Ms Giuffre intended to release a broad category of individuals including royalty, including businessmen.” Brettler also said Epstein “would never want to have to be dragged into a lawsuit were she to sue Prince Andrew later”. Kaplan said: “We don’t have Mr Epstein here to say that’s in fact what his view was.” He also said Epstein might have wanted to grant the broadest release possible, or might have intended to provide the narrowest release possible. At the end of the proceeding, the judge said: “You’ll have a decision pretty soon.” Epstein, who also counted former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among influential associates, killed himself in custody in New York in 2019. Maxwell, 60, was convicted on sex trafficking charges last month. Her lawyers have said they will appeal. Andrew has been dogged by his links to Epstein and Maxwell and by the Giuffre suit. On Tuesday, Rettler reiterated what was said in a 29 October court filing: “Giuffre settled her sex trafficking and sexual abuse claims against Epstein in 2009. In doing so, she provided Epstein with a general release of all claims against him and numerous other individuals and entities. “To avoid being dragged into future legal disputes, Epstein negotiated for this broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit – or lack thereof – to any such claims.” That filing also said: “Because Prince Andrew is a senior member of the British royal family, he falls into one of the expressly identified categories of persons, ie, royalty, released from liability under the release agreement, along with politicians, academicians, businessmen and others allegedly associated with Epstein. “As a third-party beneficiary of the release agreement, Prince Andrew is entitled to enforce the general release contained therein.” David Boies, appearing for Giuffre, argued that the parties on the agreement could handle their agreement as they jointly wished, “at least so long as the third party has not reasonably relied to their detriment on what they have promised”. Boies also said there was no “reasonable” evidence Andrew knew about the agreement before being sued by Giuffre. As part of the litigation, Giuffre’s lawyers have requested documents including proof of Andrew’s now famous claim that he cannot sweat. Giuffre has alleged that the prince was “sweating profusely all over me” at a London nightclub on an evening when, she claims, they had sex. Andrew told the BBC that could not be true, saying: “I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.” He also said that on the night cited by Giuffre, he brought his daughter Beatrice to a late-afternoon children’s party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, Surrey. The prince says he was then at home with his children all night. Oral arguments in the attempt to dismiss Giuffre’s case took place amid sustained and damaging fallout over Andrew’s links to Maxwell and Epstein. Maxwell, the daughter of the late British press baron Robert Maxwell, was convicted on five counts for luring girls as young as 14 into Epstein’s orbit for him to sexually abuse.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew’s lawyers fight to dismiss Virginia Guiffre lawsuit in court,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-lawsuit-arguments
1/5/2022,"Reinfections should be included in Covid figures for the UK as soon as possible, scientists have said, amid warnings that up to 15% of Omicron cases could be people who have had coronavirus before. At present, daily Covid case figures – which reflect the number of infections picked up by testing – do not include reinfections for all countries of the UK.  While figures for Wales do include multiple cases for the same person, provided the positive tests are more than 42 days apart, this is not the case for England, Scotland or Northern Ireland. However scientists have said that with the proportion of cases that are reinfections growing, such figures should be urgently updated. “The reinfection rate was fairly low with Delta, but is higher now, both because prior infection provides little protection against Omicron, and there is a bigger pool of people with prior infection,” said Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge. According to a report released by researchers at Imperial College London last month, the risk of reinfection with Omicron is more than five times higher than with Delta. Speaking on the Today programme on Tuesday, leading epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College said between 10% and 15% of Omicron cases are reinfections. The figure chimes with data released by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which found that of 116,683 people identified as having an Omicron infection in England between 1 November and 18 December last year, 11,103 – or 9.5% – had previously tested positive for Covid more than 90 days ago, and hence would be identified as being reinfected. The Guardian understands that reinfections were not included in the case figures published on the government’s dashboard at the start of the pandemic as it was uncertain at the time whether it was possible to be reinfected and, if it was, the interval between infections. Tim Colbourn, professor of global health systems, epidemiology and evaluation at University College London (UCL), said the case data should now be updated. “I think reinfections should be added to the dashboard as soon as possible as they will be a growing proportion of cases going forwards,” he said. “10-15% now sounds plausible and I’m sure the [proportion] will increase over the coming weeks as immunity from prior infection and vaccination wanes.” Prof Christina Pagel, director of UCL’s Clinical Operational Research Unit, agreed that the proportion of all Covid cases that are reinfections will continue to grow, although the rise is going to be modest now that Omicron is the dominant variant in the UK and the lower reinfection rates with Delta are no longer part of the overall case picture. Pagel added that in order to understand how quickly an immune-evasive variant is spreading, it is important to include reinfections. “As more and more people get infected, given current policies, over the longer term it’s going to be rare to find someone who’s never had Covid,” she said, although she added many people who have had an infection will never have had a test. The Guardian understands the UKHSA is planning to include reinfections in case data from the end of the month, however Pagel – who is not involved with the dashboard –said the task is not simple. “My understanding is that most of the complex, interlinked, data tables that underlie the dashboard need to be changed to include reinfections and that is just a massive job,” she said.",News/World news,Scientists call for Covid reinfections in UK to be included in case figures,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/scientists-call-covid-reinfections-uk-be-included-case-figures-omicron

1/5/2022,"A jury has been urged to “be on the right side of history” by acquitting four defendants accused of criminal damage over the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston. In closing speeches at Bristol crown court on Tuesday, barristers for the accused argued that the statue, which stood over the multicultural south-west city for 125 years, was so indecent and potentially abusive that it constituted a crime.  “Make no mistake members of the jury, your decision is not just going to be felt in this court room or this city,” said Liam Walker QC, representing Sage Willoughby. “It will be reverberate around the world. I urge you all to be on the right side of history.” Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, are accused with “others unknown” of helping to tie ropes around the statue’s neck and using them to pull it from its plinth in Bristol during a Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June 2020. They are on trial alongside Jake Skuse, 33, who is accused of helping roll it to Bristol harbour, where it was thrown into the River Avon. All have argued that their actions were justified by the offence the statue caused. “Each of these defendants were on the right side of history, and I submit, they were also on the right side of the law,” said Walker. “Colston’s deeds may be historical, but the continued veneration of him in this city was not. The continued veneration of him in a vibrant multicultural city was an act of abuse. “Colston’s statue normalised abuse. It condoned the shrugging acceptance of racism. It celebrated the achievements of a racist mass murderer. The continued existence of that statue was a racist hate crime.” Tom Wainwright, representing Ponsford, suggested that the historical significance, and hence the value, of the statue had been increased by its toppling – that rather than destroying history, those on trial had “created history”, while at the same time correcting the record on Colston’s crimes. “You may think it would bring the criminal justice system into disrepute if a person were convicted of criminally damaging something by adding value to it, by improving it,” Wainwright said. “Ask yourselves: what value did this statue have before 7 June 2020, and what value does it have now?” Closing for the crown, William Hughes QC told jurors that it was not Colston who was standing trial. “We made it clear when we first addressed you at the start of this case that we didn’t dispute that Edward Colston’s history was awash with his hands-on involvement with the slave trade,” Hughes said. “You have heard detailed, highly emotive evidence in that regard from David Olusoga. We are not apologists for Edward Colston but he and those of his ilk are not on trial.” Hughes said that despite the wide-ranging evidence heard of Colston’s, and Bristol’s, involvement in the slave trade; the impact of the statue on the city’s current black residents; and the failure of local politicians to take action, the trial was “not a public inquiry”, not about politics or emotions. “This trial is about cold hard facts and it is fundamentally about the rule of law,” Hughes said. “If we can simply pull down what offends us regardless of the views of others then what statues, institutions or buildings are next, you might ask.” Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Willoughby all deny criminal damage.

1/5/2022,"Only 7% of confirmed victims of trafficking from overseas have been granted leave to remain in the last five years according to new data disclosed to the Guardian. A Home Office data shows that 447 out of 6,066 confirmed trafficking victims who requested leave to remain between April 2016 and June 2021 were granted it – 7%.  Meanwhile, 4,695 confirmed trafficking victims had their applications for leave to remain in the UK rejected, according to the response to a freedom of information response request by the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC). In the remainder of cases a decision is still pending. The government has repeatedly pledged to protect trafficking victims. But charities have documented that some of those removed from the UK and returned to their home countries have fallen back into the hands of their traffickers or have been vulnerable to being picked up by new traffickers. A landmark high court judgment in October 2021 said that all confirmed trafficking victims should be granted leave to remain in the UK. Ahmed Aydeed of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, the lawyer who brought the high court case, expressed concern about the new trafficking data. “Victims of trafficking, experience a profound loss of their sense of safety and security. A reliably safe environment is a pre-requisite for recovery. By refusing, en masse it seems, leave to remain to victims, the home secretary is re-traumatising survivors and putting them at risk of being re-trafficked.” The SRC has also obtained freedom of information data which reveals that the delay in processing asylum claims has reached the highest figure for two decades with 83,733 people waiting for an initial decision on an asylum claim with 56,520 of them – including 3,796 Afghans – waiting for more than six months for an initial decision. The SRC says the newly released data is evidence of a system that is failing asylum seekers and victims of trafficking. They have shared the data ahead of the second reading of the nationality and borders bill in the House of Lords on Wednesday. SRC campaigners have urged the Lords to vote down the controversial bill which proposes “offshoring” asylum seekers to third countries while their claims are processed and imposing criminal penalties on asylum seekers who travel across the Channel in small boats to claim asylum in the UK. The new bill also proposes narrowing the grounds for discretionary leave to remain for trafficking survivors which has led to fears among anti-trafficking campaigners that very few modern slavery survivors will be allowed to remain in the UK. Graham O’Neil of the SRC said: “There is a real crisis in the chronically slow asylum decision system that awaits them. It entraps women, men and children into state-enforced poverty limbo for years. This is even when they are from high refugee recognition countries like Afghanistan, Syria and Iran. We urge the Lords to dismantle the bill, and for the government to scrap it, and invest in swifter better asylum decisions.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “A significant proportion of asylum claims in the last year should have been made in a first safe country, rather than people risking their lives making dangerous crossings, facilitated by people smugglers. “This, as well as an overall increase in claims, has led to asylum applications taking longer to be resolved and impaired our ability to focus resources on those who come to the UK via safe and legal routes and are in genuine need of our protection. “The government is committed to tackling modern slavery and providing support and protection to the victims of this heinous crime. The nationality and borders bill will go further than ever before in putting modern slavery victims’ rights into law, including granting temporary leave to remain for victims.”",News/UK news,Revealed: just 7% of trafficking victims given leave to remain in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/trafficking-victims-leave-to-remain-uk-data
1/5/2022,"Stephen Colbert returned to his first Late Show of 2022 – “an unprecedented third straight year of 2020” – with an update on Covid’s Omicron variant, which surged across the US over the holidays.  In the past week, the US logged more than 400,000 new cases of Covid each day, tripling from two weeks ago. “That is awful – the only thing that should be tripling over the holidays is my BMI,” he joked. The Omicron surge wreaked havoc on holiday travel – airlines cancelled more than 12,000 flights between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day, and New York City suspended several subway lines due to staffing issues. “What? Closing the subway because of the germs is like closing Broadway because of jazz hands,” Colbert observed. Partly in response to widespread staffing shortages, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week cut the isolation time for Americans who test positive from 10 days to five. “They also say you can swim right after you eat, breaking a mirror only gives you four years bad luck, and stepping on a crack won’t break your mother’s back, but her back will just be very disappointed,” Colbert quipped. Some have raised suspicions about the timing of the policy change, as just days before the announcement, the CEO of Delta Air Lines asked the CDC for a five-day isolation guidance. “Well, that’s just longstanding policy: if your business is named after a variant, you get to make one rule,” Colbert joked. On the Late Show, Seth Meyers celebrated Twitter’s permanent suspension of Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account for repeatedly posting Covid misinformation. Greene, a rightwing extremist and conspiracy theorist, had tweeted recently that vaccines were “failing and the Democrats are tyrants … The entire effort should be focused on life saving treatments and returning life to normal … Wide open. No masks. No mandates. No discrimination.” “We all want to get back to normal!” Meyers exclaimed. “You’re the ones who want to live with this endless cycle of misery and death and just let a highly contagious respiratory virus ravage the country. That’s not normal. The rest of us just want to slow the spread of Covid and get back to something that’s actually normal. “Regardless of how you feel about the ethics of kicking politicians off Twitter, it’s just a huge quality of life improvement, like when Trump got kicked off Twitter,” Meyers added. “Trying to live in a world where people like Trump and Greene are constantly screaming insane shit on Twitter is like trying to have a conversation with a friend on the street next to a jackhammer.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon also rang in the new year with a sense of pandemic dread. “I like having new year’s resolutions because you can just make them up as you go, sort of like the CDC rules on Covid,” he joked. The host also remarked on the blizzard which hit Washington DC on Monday, stranding Joe Biden on Air Force One when the runway’s mobile staircase got trapped in snow. “The last time DC was hit with that much whiteness it was January 6,” said Fallon. “Seriously, there hasn’t been that much white powder since Jeff Bezos’s new year’s party.” Fallon then returned to the CDC’s recommendation change for Covid isolation from 10 days to five days. “A lot of Covid regulations keep changing the longer the pandemic goes on,” he said. “For example, back then, doctors said to cough directly into your elbow. Now doctors say ‘just have fun out there’. “Also back then, you had to wash your hands for as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice,” he joked. “But now you can sing it at the speed Applebee’s employees do when you can tell they’re not really into it.”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on 2022: ‘An unprecedented third year of 2020’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/04/stephen-colbert-2022-omicron-late-show-recap
1/5/2022,"One of the biggest television wishes I harbour for this year is the end of true-crime documentaries. Ever since Netflix’s Making a Murderer hit big in 2015, the genre has found itself crashing from new low to new low. The majority of true crime shows since then have been grubby and exploitative – so quick to rush towards sensationalist thrills that they teeter on the brink of idolising criminals at the expense of victims. If I never watched another true-crime documentary, I’d be the world’s happiest boy. So it’s irritating to discover that the first big true-crime documentary of the year is one of the best I’ve seen. The Hunt for Bible John (BBC Two) is technically not new – it aired on BBC Scotland late last year – but its BBC Two debut this week should bring it wider attention. If it does, it will be absolutely warranted.  The Hunt for Bible John tells the story of Scotland’s most notorious series of murders. In 1968 and 69, three young women were killed. All three had been dancing at Glasgow’s Barrowland Ballroom, and all three were found beaten and strangled. The nickname came from witness reports of the killer quoting from the Bible. The murderer has never been caught. In other hands, this could easily have become just another true-crime documentary, trading on nothing but cheap gratification and bloodlust. What’s so impressive here is how keenly the series wants to fit the murders into a wider societal context. A long introductory tract is dedicated to the state of Glasgow in the 60s. Grim and dark and still bomb-damaged from the war, it is a city in total collapse. Running water is scarce, open drains burble human effluent in the streets. The one escape, we are told, is dancing. This took place in venues such as Barrowland: dark, heady clubs where young men and women could meet and forget the outside world. The clubs were a hive of anonymity – married men apparently made a point of visiting, twisting off their wedding rings in the toilets then hitting on girls under assumed identities – which provided perfect cover for Bible John – a tall, well-spoken man who reportedly liked to recite Old Testament verse. Reportedly is the key word. The secret of The Hunt for Bible John is that it isn’t really about Bible John – we’re shown a handful of suspects, but they’re quickly tossed aside – but about how utterly out of their depths the detectives were. The purported iniquity of the dance clubs meant that witnesses were loth to reveal themselves. The media coverage of the murders quickly whipped up a fearful hysteria that spread across the city. To this day, nobody can be completely sure if all three murders were committed by the same man. The best parts of The Hunt for Bible John show the police’s desperate attempts to try anything that could bring the murderer to justice. For the first time in Scottish history, newspapers ran an artist’s impression of Bible John. He was the subject of one of Britain’s first photofits. Places of worship were scoured, since you can’t get a nickname like Bible John without regularly attending church. They created a psychological portrait of the man. They flew in a clairvoyant from Belgium. Anything that could possibly stick was tried, and all to no avail. Fans of David Fincher might know where this is going. One key touchpoint here is Zodiac – a film about another real-life serial killer who was never caught – with the show even going as far as to use songs from its soundtrack. Another is Mindhunter, Fincher’s series about the birth of the FBI’s Behavioural Science Unit. Mindhunter depicted a crucial turning point in the understanding and capture of serial killers as we know them; their compulsions, their motivations, their patterns. If Glasgow detectives had had the benefit of this expertise, Bible John might not have managed to evade justice so effectively. But his murders took place just before this development, in a city that had been all but written off. The police never stood a chance. With everything we have now – improved knowledge of serial killers and advances in forensic technology – surely many, if not all, of these murders could have been prevented. This is the real message of The Hunt for Bible John, and it’s chilling. Less than a week in and we already have the best true-crime documentary of the year. Now, please: nobody make me watch any more of them. The Hunt for Bible John is on BBC Two on Tuesday 4 January at 9pm and is available via BBC iPlayer.",Arts/Television & radio,The Hunt for Bible John – is this the best true-crime documentary ever made?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/04/the-hunt-for-bible-john-is-this-the-best-true-crime-documentary-ever-made
1/5/2022,"The former chief executive of Swedbank has been charged with fraud, market manipulation and the unauthorised disclosure of inside information, after an investigation into a large-scale money laundering scandal in the Baltics. Birgitte Bonnesen, who was sacked as chief executive two years ago when the scandal came to light, “repeatedly spread misleading information” that the bank did not have any issues with its anti-money laundering (AML) processes in Estonia, according to Sweden’s Economic Crime Authority.  Thomas Langrot, the chief prosecutor and head of the investigation, said Bonnesen either intentionally or through gross negligence disseminated misleading information about the state of the bank’s anti-money laundering measures. This was despite Bonnesen having access to unpublished information about “extensive and serious shortcomings” about the system and information about “extensive suspicious transactions/customers”. An official report by law firm Clifford Chance, commissioned by Swedbank, found that the bank had carried out €37bn (£30bn) of transactions with a high risk of money laundering between 2014 and 2019. Langrot said there was evidence of a “cover-up” at Swedbank to stop the money laundering problems becoming public. “I have chosen to primarily prosecute for gross fraud, but there is a secondary claim regarding gross market manipulation,” said Langrot. “The misleading information gave a false impression that Swedbank did not have, or had, problems with AML processes in the bank’s operations in Estonia.” Last year, Swedbank said it would not file claims for damages against its former top executive and board. Swedbank and Danske Bank, Denmark’s biggest bank, remain under criminal and civil investigation by US regulators over money laundering scandals amounting to hundreds of billions of euros through their branches in the Baltics.

1/5/2022,"Spain and Belgium have almost treble Europe’s average number of robberies, topping its robbery league, according to a Eurostat report. The figures, compiled from 2016-2019, before the pandemic, show robberies fell in Europe by 11% over the period, with an average of approximately 55 for every 100,000 people.  In Belgium there were 146 police-reported robberies per 100,000, with 134 in Spain. The UK, at that point still in the EU, came third, with a score of 132, with Portugal fourth at 108. Hungary, at 7.4 per 100,000 people, had the lowest number of reported robberies. The Eurostat report covers the EU, the EFTA countries, as well as some EU candidate countries and potential candidate countries. While current pan-European figures have yet to be compiled, the pandemic, through a combination of lockdowns and the collapse of tourism, has seen a drastic fall in most crimes in countries with high crime rates, while it has had less impact on countries where crime was already low, such as Hungary. This has especially been the case in Spain where, compared with 2019, street robbery in 2021 fell by 34% and robbery with violence by 22%. In Barcelona the figures were 56% and 32% respectively, twice that of Madrid. As Barcelona is Spain’s – and, indeed, Europe’s – bag-snatching capital, this suggests the decline in tourism has been a decisive factor. In 2018 crime was up 17% in Barcelona, the highest increase in Spain, with an average of 12 robberies an hour, most in areas popular with tourists, according to Spain’s interior ministry. Other factors are Spain’s high youth unemployment, with more than 40% of under-25s unemployed in some regions. The relative impunity regarding petty theft is also seen as a contributing factor. The theft of goods worth less that €400 is treated as a misdemeanor punishable with a small fine. Repeat offenders are simply fined again as the offences are not cumulative. Nonetheless, the Economist’s 2021 Safe Cities Index ranked Barcelona as the fourth safest city in Europe and 11th in the world. Copenhagen was listed as the world’s safest. While robbery and pickpocketing have decreased dramatically during the pandemic, Spain’s drug-related crime is up 10% and sexual offences rose in 2021 by 9.2%, government statistics show. The 4.8m thefts across Europe in 2019 was the lowest figure since 2010, while the 1.1m drug-related crimes were the highest since 2008. Car thefts and homicide were down while there was an increase in assaults and sexual crimes. Some 36% of all intentional homicide victims in 2019 were female, with over 40% in Germany, Croatia, Denmark and the Czech Republic.",News/World news,Belgium and Spain top Europe’s pre-pandemic robbery league ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/belgium-and-spain-top-europes-pre-pandemic-robbery-league

However, the data shows that 148,725 cases were reported on Tuesday for England alone, up from 137,541 the day before, but below the peak of 162,572 reported on New Year’s Day. These figures do not include cases that are reinfections. The data released on Tuesday shows that there are 15,044 Covid patients in hospital in England, up from 9,546 the week before. The number has also risen in Scotland, over the same period from 599 to 1,147. Data was not reported for the number of Covid patients in hospital in Wales or Northern Ireland on Tuesday. The government also said a further 48 people had died in England within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 174,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.

1/5/2022,"Sometimes on a Monday or a Tuesday after work, I could really do with a G&T. Or a solitary chilled beer. Sometimes it’s just that kind of night. But if it’s a Monday or a Tuesday, the rule is this: no. Not after a hard day. Not out with friends. Not if there’s a half-full bottle of impeccably chilled pinot in the fridge. No.  Which isn’t to say that Wednesday to Sunday is a raging bacchanalian festival of booze. Rather, designating two unchanging, no-excuse-accepted alcohol-free days a week has had positive knock-on effects through the week. There are fewer times I drink alcohol at all, even on my “permitted” days, and on those days I do have alcohol I drink less. I thoroughly enjoy a glass of this or that, but sticking within the government’s not-long-ago revised down alcohol guidelines is easy. Drinking alcohol in Australia is often an all-or-nothing affair: teetotal rates (up until last year) have been steadily climbing, while a quarter of us exceed the single-session recommended limits at least once a month. It’s the latter kind of event which often leads one to swear off the stuff – particularly after the revelry of the new year. Abstinence, surely, must be the answer! An alcohol-free January! No – dry July! And so the months roll. But, for those who do not have problematic drinking levels, yet want to reduce their alcohol intake, what of a half-arsed abstinence? “Any reduction in alcohol consumption can have short- and long-term physical and psychological benefits,” says Dr Nicole Lee of the National Drug Research Institute at Curtin University. “With people who drink regularly, when they reduce their drinking many find they sleep better, they can think more clearly during the day and they lose a bit of weight. Your heart, liver, stomach and brain will thank you.” While any reduction is good, Lee says that we should probably aim for a little better than my two-day rule. Ensuring three or four days a week are alcohol-free would make keeping within the recommended weekly intake easier. “Everyone is different,” she says. “Whatever helps you to maintain a reduction in drinking days is a good thing. You might need to try a few different strategies before you find one that’s right for you.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: cutting down on alcohol – ‘your heart, liver, stomach and brain will thank you’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/easy-wins-cutting-down-on-alcohol-your-heart-liver-stomach-and-brain-will-thank-you
1/5/2022,"Around one in 10 Australians – 2.7 million people – suffer from asthma, a chronic condition involving inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This can cause breathing difficulties, wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. Understandably, fear of triggering symptoms often leads to exercise avoidance. Some people avoid it due to a high symptom burden; others have exercise-induced asthma. Even people not in these categories live in fear of exacerbating symptoms, says Dr Sarah Valkenborghs from the University of Newcastle.  But this can be a catch-22. “With avoidance of sport and exercise comes de-conditioning,” says exercise physiologist Bridget Nash from Body Smart Health, adding that physical inactivity can also worsen symptoms. “For anyone with asthma, it is highly recommended to continue regular exercise to avoid this deconditioning cycle.” All people with asthma should benefit from an exercise program when taking the right precautions, according to the Australian Association for Exercise and Sports Science. Some might even excel – about 7% of Olympians overall and 25% of Olympic swimmers have asthma. Here are some general recommendations for taking the plunge – but it’s important to first consult with a health professional for individually tailored advice and an asthma management plan. Most research on exercise for asthma has focused on aerobic activities. But Valkenborghs says increasing muscular strength will also deliver a multitude of benefits and is considered relatively safe. “The thing with strength training is you don’t increase your breathing that much at all.” The most relevant study on strength training for asthma found that diaphragmatic breathing was as effective as aerobic exercise in improving lung function. This involved putting weights on the stomach and breathing deeply from the belly to lift the weight up and down. “A lot of individuals with asthma take shallow breaths, using the muscles of the neck to expand the lungs rather than taking deep breaths using the diaphragm,” Nash says. She recommends the upper body strengthening exercises lat pulldown or row through to her clients to promote better and deeper breathing. Indoor classes may help avoid potential outdoor triggers such as cold air, pollution and pollen. Yoga or Pilates are good choices, according to Nash. “Slowing down and focusing on good-quality breathing will help make sure we are getting those deep, full breaths in,” she says. “As you start to feel more confident, you can start to incorporate with some moderate-intensity strength training to help with global strength and other co-morbidities.” Aerobic exercise is highly recommended for improving asthma-related outcomes such as quality of life, asthma control, air flow, lung function and inflammation. When ready to move to more vigorous activities, Valkenborghs says spin and Hiit classes are a good option; or aqua aerobics, which would be ideal for people whose symptoms aren’t triggered by chlorine. For any aerobic exercise, she says, a 10–15-minute warm-up with low to moderate activity can help prevent sudden irritation to the lungs. There are plenty of free activities, of course. Even walking is very beneficial, says Valkenborghs, especially for someone with asthma who wants to embark on an exercise program and is a bit deconditioned or unfit. “It’s low risk for inducing asthma and can prepare the muscles and bones for future high-intensity exercise.” As physical activity and fitness levels improve, they can start increasing the intensity by progressing to low-level interval training with intermittent walking and jogging, and later building up to a continuous jog or run, stop, run, stop. Cycling is also a good option. Swimming is ideal, especially at the beach for people triggered by chlorine. The air above the water contains virtually 100% humidity and in warm weather can provide minimal provocation to the lungs. Scuba diving has long been a definite no-no for people with asthma, says Valkenborghs, although a small percentage of people with well-managed symptoms might get a doctor’s clearance. Nash says make sure to have your Ventolin when trying a new activity, and seek professional advice on breathing techniques.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: with asthma,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/how-to-move-with-asthma
1/5/2022,"In mid-June 2020 in Melbourne, Asher’s next door neighbour complained about the plants their 12-year-old son was growing in an empty car space in the apartment complex. The body corporate threatened to fine them. In the midst of solo parenting their son through lockdown number two, it was the last straw. Asher decided to move out. To the country. It wasn’t an easy decision - it meant leaving behind the career they’d carved out over a decade, but “it’s a compromise and being a parent is a relationship that’s two-sided”.  The pandemic completely upended Asher’s plans for their son, and themselves. And while not all of us have moved the world for our kids, there are many things about the past two years that may well have changed how we parent, and our relationship with our children, permanently. John, a father of three from Melbourne, remembers back in the very anxious early days his 10-year-old daughter asked if they were going to die. He cried. “We changed then. Less news. More time spent focusing on our kids’ welfare.” Many parents are hollowed out by the anxiety they’ve carried for their children for the past two years while trying to mask their own. Hushed conversations about vaccines, diving to turn the news down as a kid’s eyes grow wider, attempting to empathise with a childhood plight we never had to deal with. There’s nothing quite like the rictus smile of a parent attempting to convince a child that another Zoom birthday is a really good time. “This is one of those times when the experience that children are having, parents are dealing with it themselves at the same time,” says the CEO of the Australian Childhood Foundation, Dr Joe Tucci, a psychologist and social worker. “It’s a lack of being able to control and plan, and we’re dealing with this existential threat in front of, and alongside, our children. As a result, parenting has become a far more adaptive process.” But as parents continue to grapple with the fallout of trauma – their own and their kids’ – some are realising that what they’ve learnt over the past two years has real and lasting value. “The pandemic reset the importance of just being able to spend time with your children,” says Nick Tebbey, national executive officer of Relationships Australia. “People drew real strength from that, and were almost surprised by how much they enjoyed their time together.” The national body, in partnership with Griffith University in Queensland, are in phase 2 of the Australian component of their Families Unlocked study to “look deeper at the medium- to long-term impacts of the pandemic on relationships and family life”. Some of the initial findings of the study show that while around two-thirds of people were anxious about their children’s wellbeing, those sorts of feelings weren’t mutually exclusive from a feeling of “we like being together”. “One of the things that we’re told over and over again is that people don’t want to lose that time,” says Tebbey. “Irrespective of all those other pressures and concerns and anxieties, there was something there that people really held on to.” Of course, not every family cuddled around a jigsaw together, and as has been well established, some experienced an uptick in acute stress, financial pressure and domestic violence during lockdowns. But the desire for a continuation of more time with kids, regardless of their age, seems to cut across the vast majority of parents, even accommodating for the vastly different experiences of the pandemic. For many, Tucci says, the pandemic has reminded us that time together can be a sanctuary, not just for kids but for their parents. “And doing nothing together is even better,” he says. “There was a dad that I would see at the park near our house quite regularly during lockdowns. All he was doing with his three-year-old was lying down in the grass. They’d pick up a leaf and then they’d put it into a pile, and then they’d pick up another leaf and put it into some other pile. This is all they did. The kid was delighted.” Some parents speaking to the Guardian had thought a lot about why they actually liked having their kids at home, given it was often also stressful and unpredictable. Some had a sense of making up for lost time, given their kids had spent a lot of time at daycare, other parents of older kids realised they genuinely enjoyed their teenagers’ company. Tebbey says there is now a much broader awareness of mental health among parents. They’ve been present to read the ripples, to observe their children far more closely. “Parents have become more attuned to their kids’ needs … because they’ll have noticed that small things set them off,” says Tucci. Patrick, a father of a seven-year-old, definitely feels “like I understand my kid more”. After home schooling one-on-one, “you pick up things you never noticed”. A 2021 study shows Australian fathers stepped up to do more childcare and housework during the pandemic, and as a result, more evenly shared the stresses and anxiety that comes with those roles too. Pre-pandemic, Patrick’s wife was the primary carer, but that changed to half and half during lockdown. Whether the more evenly distributed roles remains a trend across parents remains to be seen, but so far for Patrick it’s sticking. As for what Patrick learned about his son, who is autistic, the year taught him that his son is capable of more than he had thought. “Even small things to prove his independence, like getting his own dinner or being able to speak in more complex ways.” For Patrick, it’s been a wonderful thing to watch. “He is more capable than I give him credit for.” Extra time together taught Patrick to change his expectations of his son, and many other parents told the Guardian their kids surprised them in different ways, including realising they could be vulnerable around their children without the sky falling in. Emily, a single mother of an 18-year-old and a 10-year-old who did her fair share of home schooling while in lockdown in regional Victoria, feels like she’s learnt “to be more honest with my kids about my own feelings and circumstances”. “It’s been a realisation for parents to know how much their children know,” Tucci says. “You suddenly realise how much your life is on show to them.” Emily reckons she’s a more intuitive parent than she was, more inclined to centre her children’s needs. “Don’t want to go to school? Maybe that’s OK.” This is big for someone like Emily. She comes from a “very, very education-oriented” family – her parents are both teachers – but the past two years has taught her “the importance of understanding my kids as individuals rather than as part of the education system as a whole”. “A lot of parents gave up trying to maintain that school frenzy of doing everything,” Tucci says. “And schools were gentler, too. They just sort of … slowed down. They were noticing what their children needed and their children just needed space. They needed time. They needed to play and they needed relationships, which is what kids have always needed.” This combination of letting go and a faith in intuition may have resulted in a renewed sense of confidence among parents in their own skills. In a global study of more than 5,000 people across the US, UK, France, Germany, India, Singapore, China and Brazil, 61% said they felt much or somewhat more confident in their parenting skills now than before lockdowns. “Certainly during the pandemic, you could never subcontract out your responsibilities for your children to their teachers or their social groups or anything,” says Tebbey. “It really came down to you as the parents. We’ve seen now that we can play that more active role and be more invested in what our children are going through.” But can parents continue to carve out time, and go gently, as the world around them rapidly speeds up again? “If there’s opportunities for companies and businesses to think creatively about different work weeks or work hours for parents, for families, it’ll benefit everybody,” says Tucci. The Australian Childhood Foundation’s 2020 report A Lasting Legacy: the impact of Covid 19 on children and parents highlights the need for governments at all levels to have “a stronger focus on parental well-being and family functioning”. Support should come in different forms – ranging from online resources to connection with other parents through online communities, to professional advice at times when parents need it. “It’s a potential legacy,” Tucci says. “I don’t think parents did relax our expectations. We broadened our expectations. Now we can appreciate that ability to do stuff that’s just nonsensical, like just putting leaves into piles.” After a rocky start with the move, Asher’s son’s new veggie patch is thriving. And Asher felt their relationship with their son shift. He saw the effort Asher was making with the relocation – the tradies, movers, re-enrolling in school – and began helping. “Unasked. Sometimes bringing in laundry or helping with dishes.” “We grew closer,” says Asher. “I’m not sure if he knew before that he’d always come first no matter what. I think he thought he was part of my whirlwind, but didn’t know he was central to it all.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I understand my kid more’: how the pandemic changed parenting,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/i-understand-my-kid-more-how-the-pandemic-changed-parenting
1/5/2022,"When the world first met Angus and Julia Stone, it was as a duo. The sibling act began releasing gentle folk-pop music in 2006, swiftly finding global success with hits like Big Jet Plane. The pair still make music together (their latest album, Life is Strange, arrived in 2021) but also have solo projects. Apart, their sounds have diverged: Julia released a record full of bright, shimmering pop music in April 2021 while Angus makes blissed-out rock as Dope Lemon. This Friday 7 January, Angus returns with his third album under the moniker, titled Rose Pink Cadillac.  Essential to every record Angus makes is a particular guitar: a 1960s Telecaster given to him by his father. Here, Stone tells us about that “holy grail” instrument, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. When we last toured the States, [Apple co-founder] Steve Wozniak would fly in to different shows we were playing. It was so cool seeing him at the front of the barrier – the biggest legend to walk Earth, singing all the lyrics to the tunes we had written. There was one show where we were chilling backstage and Steve came up and told me he wanted me to have something special, which he only had a few of. It was four [fake] $2 bills he had created back in the day. They have sneaky little markings on them that he only told me about. They look like a real bill – down to a tee – and would pass if put in circulation, but because they were created by the man that invented Apple, they are very precious to me. He’s a legend, by the way – salt of the earth and a good storyteller. After shows, backstage, there would always be a group around him as he spoke. It was dope to see the legend live on. I’d also have to grab a special gift given to me by my beautiful sister Julia on my 30th birthday. It is a geometric crystal hanging light, made by an incredible artist called Asaf Zakay. It’s worth its weight in gold but it also signifies our time together, spending our 20s travelling the world and sharing what we created. It’s a piece of magic – a little portal to our relationship as brother and sister. A gift given to me by my parents for my 21st. I grew up with this guitar that was basically regarded around the house and town as the holy grail of guitars: a unique 1960s Telecaster. I have never seen another like it in my many years on the road and we’ve been around some of the world’s most storied guitarists who would gawk at it. When we toured with Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham and the gang were tripped out. It was my dad’s very first guitar that he bought off his guitar teacher. It lives on basically every record I’ve ever released. It’s become a defining sound of my albums and will stay that way for many more to come. The item I most regret losing is a cowboy boot someone nicked from backstage in Amsterdam. They only took one, which was strange. So I have the other to be like “damn, one day we will reunite you with your comrade”. I hope whoever took it has some flowers growing in it, on a windowsill, somewhere in a small cobblestone street in Holland, and are enjoying it as much as I enjoy the one I have at home.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Three things with Angus Stone: ‘I most regret losing a cowboy boot, nicked backstage.

1/5/2022,"Nick Kyrgios will arrive in Sydney later this week with a lowly rankings status he has not borne since his stunning breakout performance at Wimbledon back in 2014. The Australian started a summer critical to his ability to retain a place on the main ATP Tour in unfortunate circumstances when forced to withdraw from a tournament in Melbourne on Tuesday.  It means he will slide outside the top 100 for the first time since his run to the Wimbledon quarter-finals as a teenager ranked No 144 eight seasons ago. On a live estimate Kyrgios now sits at 115, but it is possible that will dip further by the next official rankings release on Monday, just a week out from the Australian Open. The 26-year-old cited asthma as the reason for his inability to take to the baseline against Slovakian Alex Molčan at Melbourne Park in an ATP 250 tournament on Tuesday night. “I’m really sorry that I’ve had to pull out from this Melbourne Summer Set event,” he said in a statement. “I have been feeling run down and unwell for four days. I have had several Covid tests over the last few days which all came back negative. I don’t feel 100% so I need to take this week to be ready for Sydney next week.” Melbourne can be a problematic city for asthmatics and breathing issues are not to be trifled with, particularly when the pandemic is raging again in Australia due to the Omicron variant. It is hoped the six-time ATP Tour titlist will be able to take his place as a wildcard in another ATP Tour tournament in Sydney. But there are several ramifications resulting from his withdrawal from the season-opening match. His fans in Melbourne miss an opportunity to see an athlete who, at his peak, is an entertainer blessed with the weapons to trouble any of his peers on the tour. As per his profile, the Canberran had been allotted the prime-time match on Rod Laver Arena despite the all-star card for events being held in Melbourne in the opening week. Reigning Australian Open champion Naomi Osaka, dual Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and 20-time major winner Rafael Nadal were among the champions in action on Tuesday. But Kyrgios retains box-office appeal, particularly in Australia, and the host broadcaster was clearly keen to showcase the local star in front of the biggest possible audience. It means that unless Kyrgios can find some momentum in Sydney, he will return to Melbourne short of match-fitness following two restricted seasons in 2020 and last year. This could be problematic given the 2015 Australian Open quarter-finalist finds himself in a fight to stay in touch with the top 100, let alone return to it. The right-hander has demonstrated in the past he is more than capable of performing off an interrupted preparation. Despite limited match play leading into the Australian Open last February he was able to make it to the 3rd Round. The former world No. 13 edged talented Frenchman Ugo Humbert, who defeated Daniil Medvedev in an ATP Cup rubber this week, before testing US Open champion Dominic Thiem in an engrossing encounter on his favourite court at Melbourne Park. Kyrgios said recently that he is not motivated by his ranking. Nor, as he has stressed many times, is he driven by a desire to claim a grand slam title. But the Australian’s best tennis has traditionally come on the biggest stages in sport, with the enigmatic right-hander riffing off the energy he can draw from crowds that flock to see him. The problem is he may not feature on those stages for some time, and instead find himself in off-Broadway tournaments around the world, unless he performs well over the next three weeks. The Laver Cup star has 90 ranking points to defend at the Australian Open and should he fail to make a run next week in Sydney, or make at least the 3rd Round at Melbourne Park, Kyrgios will find himself firmly in the rankings wilderness. No matter the talent of a player, being ranked outside the top 100 can be a difficult spot to rebound from, as he will know from the trevails of at least a couple of his close friends on the tour. Andre Agassi managed to do so, using his extraordinary ethic to effectively reignite his career when enjoying stunning success in his 30s, but he is an exception. Murray, who returned from a career-threatening hip injury in February last year using a protected ranking, is finding it a tougher task. Despite some good signs at times during the 14 singles tournaments he played last year, the Scot was only able to rebuild his ranking to 134 by the end of the 2021 season and was beaten in Melbourne by Facundo Bagnis 6-3 5-7 6-3 in the opening round on Tuesday. Thanasi Kokkinakis, another who showed great promise as a teenager, produced some strong results when playing almost an entire season for the first time in years. Yet the South Australian was only able to improve his ranking to 171 in 2021, in part due to the rankings protections the ATP put in place during the pandemic. While Murray was able to play on the main tour using an injury-protected wildcard and wildcards, Kokkinakis spent much of the season on the secondary Challenger tour. Because of his profile, Kyrgios would also draw sponsors’ invitations to smaller ATP Tour tournaments. But if he is unable to succeed this summer, it is plausible one of Australia’s brighter talents will be forced to qualify for the next grand slam at Roland Garros in late May.",Sport/Sport,Heat is on Nick Kyrgios’s critical summer as Australian Open looms | Courtney Walsh,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/heat-is-on-nick-kyrgioss-critical-summer-as-australian-open-looms
1/5/2022,"Still Life is a quiet British film with a mighty heart. Written and directed by Uberto Pasolini (best known as a producer of The Full Monty), it tackles the subject of loneliness with the lightest of touches. John May (Eddie Marsan) is a man who notices. His job at a local London council depends on it: part detective, part chief mourner, it falls on him to track down the next of kin of residents who died intestate and, invariably, alone. Over 22 years, May’s role has expanded to include organising, attending and writing the eulogies for the funerals of his “clients”. He pieces together their lives by observation – a birthday card here, a dent in a pillow there – and creates a life for them in words and music.  Marsan inhabits the role of May with very few words and even fewer gestures. His presence is a stillness in the centre of the camera lens while life in all its noisy chaos goes on around him. Background noise is turned up a notch – traffic, bird song, distant voices – as if to emphasise the quietness of his own life. Marsan himself is probably one of the best character actors you’ve never heard of. Known in the UK for his television and film appearances – including in Mike Leigh’s 2008 feature Happy-Go-Lucky, and in the US for crime drama Ray Donovan – he received the best British actor award at the 2014 Edinburgh international film festival for his portrayal of May, his first role as the romantic lead. Romance is not a part of May’s daily life. He lives alone in a tidy council flat devoid of any personal touches. He is shocked to learn that his latest client – left for weeks before being found – lived opposite him. “A loner,” says his unsympathetic boss Mr Pratchett (The Crown’s Andrew Buchan). “You know the type.” The death of this fellow loner – William Stoke – affects May more than any of the others. When May is “let go” from his council job shortly after, he asks for more time to arrange a suitable send-off for Stoke. Pratchett grudgingly allows him a few days, unpaid, to complete this last case. May’s dogged research leads him to an estranged daughter named Kelly (Downton Abbey’s Joanne Froggatt) living in Truro, Cornwall. She too lives alone, and the two strangers share the unspoken empathy of lonely people. They meet up again at a cafe a few days before the funeral to go over the arrangements. Kelly Stoke can hardly fail to be touched by the thoughtfulness of the man sitting across from her. As her train leaves the station, she asks John if he would meet her after the funeral for a cup of tea. From that moment on, May’s demeanour changes. His blank expression takes on a sweetness bordering on a smile. For the first time, a gentle guitar score can be heard above the now-muted sounds of the train running on its tracks and the cries of children in the park. He is now an active participant in the world that surrounds him, not a passive onlooker. The camerawork in Still Life conveys the loneliness of the main character and that of his “charges” in this dialogue-light film. Its title is reflected in the painterly still shots and vignettes of the empty spaces they leave behind. Small gestures take on a poignancy that makes parts of it almost unbearable to watch. The final controversial scene has divided reviewers and led to accusations that it undoes all the goodwill built up to that point. The sceptical are outraged and the sentimental are moved by it: either way, it’s worth investing the 88 minutes it takes to reach the end of this moving, unpretentious gem of a film.",Arts/Culture,Still Life: 2013’s big-hearted gem is a all the lonely people,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/05/still-life-2013s-big-hearted-gem-is-a-salute-to-all-the-lonely-people
1/5/2022,"Waters off Sydney are undergoing an extreme marine heatwave with temperatures likely at their highest levels on record for January. Satellite data is showing the ocean surface off the coast of Sydney at 3C above normal, with swimmers and surfers reporting conditions that feel more like February and March than early January.  Prof Moninya Roughan, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales and an expert in marine heatwaves, said the hottest water was covering an area of about 200sq km. Roughan is waiting until new data becomes available in the coming weeks from a long-term ocean temperature monitoring station at Port Hacking, where temperatures have been observed since the 1950s. But she said: “It appears now to be reaching those record levels and will likely be the hottest January on record. It’s an extreme marine heatwave.” She said there were three factors behind the extra heat. Global heating was pushing up background temperatures in the ocean, a La Nina weather system was helping transport warmer waters south, and atmospheric conditions were also playing a role. “Marine heatwaves are having severe consequences on ecosystems and they can kill habitats,” she said. She said the warm belt of water off Sydney was still attached to the East Australian Current – the 100km-wide belt that runs south from the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland to the area off Sydney. She expected a large eddy would break off from the tip of the current and take warmer waters south of Sydney. “I expect that water will hang around and push south over the coming months,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prof Rob Harcourt, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, regularly surfs off Sydney beaches. “It’s been over 21C in the water for over a month now. Everyone that surfs has been talking for weeks about how it’s felt more like February and March than December [when the heat started to build].” He said the warmer water was likely bringing bull and tiger sharks into the area and also farther south. Other species would also likely be arriving on the warmer waters.

A lot of animals that live in cooler waters, like seals and sharks, have a habitat that’s shrinking fast and the implications are hard to measure, but it’s likely to be dramatic.” He said in recent weeks whale sharks had been spotted north of Sydney and tiger and great white sharks had been seen feeding off a sperm whale carcass on the state’s far south coast. “Whale sharks do come down the coast but they’re rare,” he said. Whale sharks are a great tourist attraction in Western Australia, but are rarely seen off the other side of the country. 🐋So it was an unexpected thrill for two New South Wales fishermen when they had a very personal encounter with one of the gentle giants. @AirlieWalsh #9News pic.twitter.com/Bj67mgsc5C He said warm water arriving on the current was nothing new, but this arrival was particularly early and was unusually warm.

1/5/2022,"Hospitals workers in New South Wales have vented their anger at being left on the frontline with seriously depleted levels of staffing amid a major surge in Covid cases, as nurse-to-patient ratios are cut and others face shortages on their intensive care wards. “The light at the end of a tunnel is a fricking train at the moment,” said Gil Wilson, a senior nurse at the Lismore Base hospital and a NSW Nurses and Midwives Association delegate. “We can’t see an end to this.”  The regional hospital, which serves a large area of northern NSW as the main Covid treatment centre, recently added an 18-bed intensive care unit. Staffing levels, though, didn’t increase in tandem. “Why didn’t we change it to be able to be staffed to be able to take, say, 10 or 12 ventilated patients?” Wilson, who has worked as a nurse for 32 years, said. “Now we’re only staffed to take four and that’s why I’m going into pulling an extra shift this afternoon.” Northern NSW includes some of the state’s anti-vaccination pockets. The Byron Bay region, for instance, was only about 85% double vaccinated as of 20 December, among the lowest rates in the state, according to federal government statistics. ICU nursing requires skills that can’t be whipped up “with a couple of days’ training”, Wilson said. Such nurses “operate the machine that’ll breathe for you, they calibrate the machine so it can replace your kidneys, they can operate multiple drug infusions to keep your heart and other organs functioning, and monitor you the whole time”.Covid has also made life harder for staff, who have to don full personal protective equipment “sweating your arse off for a full eight-hour shift”, he said, adding “it requires a great deal of effort to turn somebody who has a breathing tube in and a heap of other tubes”. On Tuesday, NSW set a record for daily cases with 23,131 new infections reported – almost 28% of those who came forward for testing in the previous 24-period. Those in hospital with Covid jumped 16% on the previous day, to 1,344, while those in ICU rose almost 10% to 104, the state government said. Hospital staff said that existing service levels were barely meeting current needs even before an expected spike in new hospitalisations in the coming weeks. The NSW health department was approached for comment. At Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred hospital, as many as seven ambulances were lined up at the emergency department on Tuesday afternoon, with a makeshift tent providing cover for an overflow of about a dozen would-be patients. “It’s going smoothly,” one security guard said. “The tent is for priority patients.” Hospital staff, though, declined to comment directly to Guardian Australia. “Not interested,” said one hospital worker when approached. “I’m in a hurry.” A NSW Health spokesperson said the department had more than 140,000 staff, and that since 2011 it had increased the workforce by almost 25,000 full-time equivalent staff, with a further 8,300 full-time workers to be added. “All local health districts have well-developed workforce surge and demand management plans in place, and our networked hospital system ensures patients can be transferred or redirected to other hospitals where necessary, including private hospitals,” the spokesperson said. The Northern NSW district had “sufficient intensive care beds across the three major hospitals in Grafton, Lismore and Tweed, with plans in place to surge staffing and ICU capacity, if and when required”. Michelle Rosentreter, an ICU nurse at another major metropolitan Sydney hospital and also a NSW Nurses and Midwives Association delegate, said emergency departments had become the “Covid frontline”. “We would argue that the frontline is actually your GPs and their community testing clinics, access to free rapid antigen tests or PCR testing,” Rosentreter said. “As they start to close down – which is what the government is doing because it’s obviously costing them too much money to look after public health – those consumers come in directly to the emergency departments. “That’s putting an incredibly big strain on our hospitals because our workforce is significantly reduced. We don’t have the capacity to constantly treat these numbers.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ideally, one nurse should serve three emergency department beds at most, with as many as 20 patients processed per shift. “At the moment, it’s one [nurse] to 10, one to 20 [beds]” at Rosentreter’s hospital.Rosentreter has herself been waiting for five days for the results of a PCR test to be returned after her daughter – also a nurse – contracted Covid. Staff who are not showing symptoms have been recalled to work but there remains “a huge risk” they will infect others, whether patients or staff, she said. “There’s no setup in the workplace for them to remove the mask in order to have a drink of water or have something to eat,” she said. “So basically, you do your whole shift and avoid everybody, keeping on your PPE.” While the health system had some surge capacity, in order to cope with winter flu outbreaks, there had been insufficient investment for a long period, she said. “Our political leaders always told us we have a very robust, healthy and well-ranked health system. But in reality, it has been a system over the years, pre-pandemic, that has been grossly under-resourced with shackles on recruitment and budgets. “We’re looking at the real face of burnout now.

1/5/2022,"The federal government has pledged $316.5m for a new Indigenous cultural precinct in Canberra that would include a long-awaited national resting place for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ancestral remains. The proposed centre, to be called Ngurra, which means home, country or place of belonging in different Aboriginal languages, will incorporate a learning and knowledge centre and the relocated Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (Aiatsis).  It will be built on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin on Ngunnawal country in Canberra within the parliamentary triangle that includes other prominent national institutions. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the centre would become a “place of national pride and significance” and hailed its proposed location as demonstrating the “importance and reverence this institution should hold”. “Ngurra is the realisation of a long-held desire to have a home for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and histories at the heart of our nation,” Morrison said. “It will be a national landmark of the highest order, standing proudly for us all to celebrate, educate, reflect and commemorate.” A national resting place for ancestral remains was formally recommended to government in 2014 when an advisory committee for Indigenous repatriation completed the national resting place consultation report. Two parliamentary committees have since endorsed the recommendation. The project, which underwent a $4.7m business case process after the May budget, would be built “fully in accordance” with the proposal developed by Aiatsis. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Aiatsis chief executive, Craig Ritchie, said he was “super excited” the project was going ahead and he hoped work could begin by the end of the year. He said the aspiration of the precinct was to shift the story of Indigenous Australia away from a focus on disadvantage to one that highlighted the “richness of our cultures, the sophistication of our world views and its relationship to country and place”. “There is a deeply ingrained way of thinking about Indigenous Australia that is defined by disadvantage, and that challenge is real, but it is not who we are,” Ritchie told Guardian Australia. “We wanted the opportunity to do more than just recite grievances, but really showcase the brilliance of First Nations cultures in a way … that all Australians have access to.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Morrison said the centre would give Australians and international visitors “a deeper appreciation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ diversity and cultures, and the richness this offers our country”. “This new world-class facility will contribute to our continuing journey of reconciliation, where Indigenous Australians can tell their stories, in the way they want, for all visitors to have a greater understanding of our shared history,” the prime minister said. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said the new learning and engagement centre – and the exhibitions, research and curation that would occur at Ngurra – would result in “significant acts of truth-telling”. “At its heart will be a national resting place where the remains of Indigenous Australians taken from their country will be cared for until they are able to be returned to their communities,” Wyatt said. “In instances where provenance has been forgotten or erased, they will be cared for in perpetuity with dignity and respect.” The relocation of Aiatsis, which has spearheaded the project, will also make accessible the world’s largest collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural and heritage items. “Ngurra will provide a new perspective on our shared history, as a significant moment for truth-telling, and a new place where the diversity of Indigenous Australia and one of the world’s oldest living cultures will be celebrated,” the minister said. The earmarked site is on Commonwealth Place on the primary axis in the parliamentary triangle – between Old Parliament House and the Australian War Memorial.

1/5/2022,"This week, Scott Morrison insisted the provision of rapid antigen tests for those without symptoms or who have not been told to get tested by authorities should be left to the “private market”. Having referred to what he called more “casual uses” of rapid tests, the prime minister said: “We’re at another stage of this pandemic now where we just can’t go round and make everything free.”  While some state governments – principally New South Wales and Victoria – last week said they wanted to distribute rapid antigen tests free to the general public, they later watered down these commitments. However, some governments overseas have taken a very different approach when it comes to rapid tests. Here are some examples. Perhaps the best known example to most Australians, the UK government offers people access to free self-administered rapid antigen tests through the National Health Service. They are provided free through local pharmacies, with residents able to obtain a “collect code” and then pick them up. Individuals can also grab two packs of seven rapid tests from community locations such as libraries. And they can also be ordered through a home delivery service. The NHS website notes people might wish to do a free test when they “mix with people in crowded indoor places” or “visit someone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19”. These are examples of what the Australian government views as “casual uses” for such tests. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some Australians in the UK have noted the contrast between the two systems. “It’s been so good that they’re free,” says Jordan Marshall, an Australian living in London. “My partner’s a paramedic so we’ve been quite proactive about testing.” Marshall says she’s probably used about 20 rapid tests over about three months, with many of those in the lead up to Christmas. “While there’s been supply issues, the fact that we can get boxes delivered to the house means you can have greater level of confidence you’re not out there spreading it in the community,” she says. Just collected another free pack of 7 from local pharmacy. Order via NHS App and show code - 1 per day. Can’t believe Australian Govt hasn’t ordered enough and expect people to pay. What about those living in below poverty line payments like JobSeeker? pic.twitter.com/gboZXT6t43 Just ordered a packet of rapid tests online. For free.Supplies have run down during Omicron, but in theory each household can do this this every day here in the UK.Hundreds of millions of tests sent out so far. For free. https://t.co/82aqJWL2z2 pic.twitter.com/l48itUfiMg My brother’s mail this morning, living in the UK outside of London. Free from the government. State capacity is a thing. pic.twitter.com/h4rYM9aGlW The Singaporean government sent households 10 free rapid antigen tests in the mail between October and December. It undertook a similar process, providing six tests per household, between August and September. The government also has a program that offers free rapid testing kits to employers, who then provide them to workers. By October, 11,000 businesses had signed up, reports the Straits Times. Tests that are sold at retailers are also now considerably cheaper than those currently on offer in Australia, where tests had cost between $10 and $15 each, but have since exploded to as much as $30 to $40 a pop in some cases. From 10 December, it was reported that Singaporean retailers were stocking “Flowflex” tests at $5 each, while a pack of five cost $24. Singapore is distributing free Antigen Rapid Tests for Covid-19 to all households. Ours arrived in the mail today. https://t.co/MIAkmlyPDl pic.twitter.com/PPUDxykFDN Watching this thread makes me once again so happy to be in Singapore. Our ART tests are everywhere. Our oximeters were delivered for free by the government months ago. We're ready for omicron. (We probably have all been going through it tbh, with ART tests at home who knows). https://t.co/nWRrbUJyUP Home rapid test kits are considered a “controlled item” in Malaysia and supply is controlled by the government. They are sold at pharmacies with a capped price of $6.60, though they are often cheaper than that. Aliya Ahmad, a Pakistani Australian visiting her parents who live in Malaysia, says tests tend to cost between $2 and $6 each. “The pharmacies and chemists are all over the place, at least in the city where I live,” Ahmad says. “Also, while I can only really speak for what I’ve been observing myself, it seems like general practice to take one before going to a big gathering or a house with elders.” Rapid antigen tests in Malaysia are set at govt regulated prices to stop price gouging and are super cheap and everyone takes one before going to persons house or event or gathering and everyone wears masks and sanitises and checks in and it’s nice to be back 🥺 Since late last month, France has made self-administered rapid tests available at supermarkets. They are subject to price controls, meaning they cannot cost more than $8 per test. The government urged residents to use the tests before New Year’s Eve celebrations.

Citizens can obtain four of these tests per month, though this was expanded to six tests in December during the lead up to Christmas. Self-administered rapid antigen test kits are also available in shops, generally for about $4-6 per test. A negative rapid test is required to enter some venues throughout Portugal.

No fuss and no arguing about “freedoms”. pic.twitter.com/dLqXPIL7CU Some Canadian provinces, such as Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan, have offered free rapid tests through local distribution centres. In the case of Nova Scotia, 400,000 tests were reportedly handed out in December through local libraries (the population is about 970,000), though the initiative concluded late last month. Ontario, home to Toronto, is offering a free take-home rapid test to residents as part of a holiday testing blitz that will last into this month. The federal government also has a program offering free rapid tests to businesses. Germany offers free rapid antigen tests once a week at testing centres. Self-administered take-home kits are also available at pharmacies and, according to Bloomberg, were on sale for as little as about $2.50 in November. The US has been hit by a shortage of rapid tests in many places and costs are broadly comparable with Australia. In some cities, free tests are available to the general public for pick up, subject to supply. For example, Washington DC residents can pick up a free home rapid test from local schools. #WashingtonDC says it will deliver a free rapid test to any resident who asks for one https://t.co/iMVAd1r3oX The Biden administration intends to distribute 500m rapid test kits free of charge to people to use at home. It’s expected the tests will be sent out from this month. It should be noted that, like Australia, many of these countries have been hit by supply shortages. The Guardian reported that the UK’s free rapid tests system has been hit by supply issues that frustrated residents over the holiday period. And, unlike some other countries, high-quality PCR tests do remain free in Australia, though the government is now trying to limit them to people who are symptomatic or high-risk close contacts. With the Australian system under massive pressure, it has become incredibly hard to get a test and some results are taking as long as five days to come back. National cabinet is expected to determine concessional arrangements that might give some Australians access to cheaper rapid antigen tests on Wednesday. Some states are also set to provide more details about their plans to distribute some free rapid tests, though these will likely only apply to certain vulnerable groups.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison opposes free rapid antigen tests.

1/5/2022,"An “unprecedented” number of people have withdrawn from Australia’s overseas diplomatic postings during the pandemic, an internal government document has revealed. At the same time, a drop in the number of Australians travelling abroad “has not led to a reduction in consular cases around the world”, according to the detailed briefing provided to the new head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was released under freedom of information laws with some pages redacted.  Officials also said the department wanted to “tell a more compelling story about its value in delivering government priorities” – a phrase that is likely to be code for ensuring it can win budget battles for extra funding and to avoid budget cuts. Australia already has a smaller diplomatic network than similar countries, the document shows. The 51-page incoming operational brief was prepared for the new secretary, Kathryn Campbell, who took up the post in July. It shows the number of positions at Australian embassies and high commissions has declined in recent years, with Dfat employees on overseas postings dropping from 897 in June 2017 to 833 in June 2020. Dfat reduced the number of positions for locally hired staff at Australia’s 113 overseas missions from 2,419 to 2,106 over the same period. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In an implicit warning against cuts, the document said: “Our global network is smaller than those of comparable economies and, on current number of posts, we are second last in the G20 (Saudi Arabia ranks last) and 20th in the OECD (behind countries such as Belgium, Hungary, Greece and Chile).” The document said Australia was focused on the Pacific, with the opening of new posts in the Marshall Islands, French Polynesia and Niue over the past two years. “In the midst of heightened strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific and an international order under intense stress, a strong diplomatic network is essential for protecting and advancing Australia’s national interest.” The document gives an insight into how the pandemic has “reshaped the department’s operations, both in Australia and across the overseas network”. “The overseas network is under pressure following an unprecedented number of posting withdrawals and declining interest in postings in the Covid-19 environment,” the department told Campbell, the former head of the Department of Social Services. “As at 8 July 2021, 148 staff had terminated their posting early, or withdrawn before deployment, due to Covid-19 related concerns.” As of the same date, there were 40 active Covid cases and 554 recovered cases across all Australian government staff posted abroad, accompanying dependants, locally engaged staff and contractors in the overseas network – a significantly higher number of known cases than the ABC reported in April.

Workload pressures and a lack of travel options had reduced the use of annual leave, “adding to fatigue and risk of burnout”. The document did not go into detail about the department’s handling of tens of thousands of Australians stranded abroad during the pandemic, although it noted the Australian National Audit Office was investigating the issue, including “our capacity to learn from our response”. It cited the $120m promise in the May 2021 budget to increase Australia’s consular capacity and provide support to vulnerable citizens affected by travel restrictions. Dedicated staffing for consular and crisis response services had increased to 210 staff. “Individual consular cases remain at the pre-pandemic level of about 1,200 cases active (or open) on any given day: comprising approximately 350 welfare cases, 170 deaths, 240 arrests and 240 prisoners. The most sensitive of these cases require careful, daily management.” The consular emergency centre responded to about 7,000 calls, 4,000 emails and hundreds of text messages each month, it said. The department manages 280 active social media accounts globally, with a total of about 4.6 million followers, according to the document. During the pandemic the department scaled up “the provision of regular high-quality social media content” for use by Australian embassies. “The Dfat you are inheriting is very different to that which your predecessor took up in 2016,” the department told Campbell, who took over from career diplomat Frances Adamson, now the South Australian governor. The document said Dfat was a leader across the Australian public service on gender equality, but analysis of five years of data showed increases in the number of staff who identified as LGBTI or as Indigenous were “starting to flatline”. The number of staff who identified as having a disability had “stagnated” around 3.5%, and the number of employees from non-English-speaking backgrounds had fallen. “As the department responsible for representing Australia to the world, we should reflect the community we represent and the global environment in which we operate,” the document said. Large portions of the section on integrity and fraud control were redacted, but the document said the department faced “changing and increasing risks”, and more than 90% of fraud cases were reported from the development program. A section of the document about freedom of information was also partly redacted, as disclosure would “have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of an agency”. The uncensored part noted the department had processed 18% more FOI requests in 2020-21 than the year before, but it was “defending a further 42 decisions before the Information Commissioner, and two complex matters before the court”. Campbell was also given a detailed policy brief, but this was blocked from release on the basis it would damage Australia’s international relations.",News/Australia news,"Australia loses ‘unprecedented’ number of overseas diplomats during pandemic, document reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/australia-loses-unprecedented-number-of-overseas-diplomats-during-pandemic-document-reveals
1/5/2022,"The Catholic church’s failed attempt to argue it was not responsible for a priest’s abuse of a five-year-old, because it took place during after-hours “social” visits, has been slammed as “ruthless” by the survivor and an “affront to common sense” by a judge. In December 2021, the Victorian supreme court handed down a judgment finding the current diocese of Ballarat was vicariously liable for the abuse of the boy, who cannot be named, by Father Bryan Coffey in Port Fairy in the early 1970s.  The survivor’s lawyers, Ken Cush & Associates, say the ruling is a landmark win that will help countless other survivors. Coffey abused the boy during pastoral care visits to his home on two occasions in 1971. The critical issue in the case was whether Coffey, an assistant parish priest, could be considered a formal employee of the diocese at the time, thereby making it vicariously liable for his actions. The church argued Coffey was not a formal employee and so it could not be held liable for his actions. It also said Coffey’s home visits were “social outings” not connected to his work for the church. The judge in the case, Justice Jack Forrest, described the suggestion as “sheer nonsense”. “It is, in my view, both inconceivable and an affront to common sense to suggest (as the Diocese put it) that these visits to parishioners’ houses and [the survivor’s] home were unconnected with Coffey’s pastoral role within the Church and merely social outings separate to his role as an assistant priest,” he said. The court found the abuse occurred and that the diocese was vicariously liable for Coffey’s actions. Forrest found Coffey was not a formal employee of the church, given the absence of any formal employment contract or arrangement, and the lack of immediate control or supervision by the diocese of his work. But it found the diocese was still vicariously liable for the abuse due to the close nature of relationship between the bishop, the diocese and the Catholic community in Port Fairy; the diocese’s general control over Coffey’s role and duties; and the fact that Coffey had a pastoral role in the town, which included home visits. It found the relationship between the survivor, his family, Coffey, and the diocese was one of “intimacy and imported trust in the authority of Christ’s representative, personified by Coffey”. “I am also satisfied that Coffey’s role as a priest under the direction of the Diocese placed him in a position of power and intimacy vis-à-vis [the survivor] that enabled him to take advantage of [the survivor] when alone – just as he did with other boys,” he said. Forrest found that the survivor had failed to prove negligence on the part of the diocese, given there was no evidence it had any actual knowledge of Coffey’s misconduct or any evidence that would lead to an inference that the diocese should have known of Coffey’s proclivities. The court awarded the survivor $230,000. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the survivor said the church’s approach to the case had caused him significant distress. “They weren’t giving anything away,” he said. “They wanted to drag me through it, and they dragged me through it.” He had been cross-examined for three days and forced to relive painful memories, including the sudden death of both of his parents in a car crash in 1985, in a way he thought was irrelevant to the case. The argument that the home visits were not connected to Coffey’s work as a priest, the survivor said, was “ruthless”. “That really upset me, because you know, I was always brought up that a priest is a priest, 24 hours a day,” he said. “We always had priests and nuns visit the house, and the nuns were never out of their habits when they came to the house. The priest was never out of his clerical tie when he visited the house.” “They just tried to argue their way out of it.” Ken Cush & Associates special counsel Sangeeta Sharmin said the ruling, for the first time, provided a binding authority that allowed a diocese to be held vicariously liable for the abuse conducted by its priests. “This verdict, along with the courage our client has shown in fighting for the rights of that five-year-old version of himself, will help countless other victims of church abuse in the future,” she said. “As it should be, because dioceses need to take responsibility for the men they placed in these communities, asked their congregations and donors to trust, and who people looked to for spiritual guidance. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The argument will no longer be able to be used as a shield by Catholic institutions, and our efforts in striving to give abuse victims a voice has finally culminated in this landmark decision.” The church and the office of the current bishop for Ballarat, Paul Bird, were contacted for a response.

1/5/2022,"No wonder journalists have slated it. They’ve produced a hundred excuses not to watch the climate breakdown satire Don’t Look Up: it’s “blunt”, it’s “shrill”, it’s “smug”. But they will not name the real problem: it’s about them. The movie is, in my view, a powerful demolition of the grotesque failures of public life. And the sector whose failures are most brutally exposed is the media. While the film is fast and funny, for me, as for many environmental activists and climate scientists, it seemed all too real. I felt as if I were watching my adult life flash past me. As the scientists in the film, trying to draw attention to the approach of a planet-killing comet, bashed their heads against the Great Wall of Denial erected by the media and sought to reach politicians with 10-second attention spans, all the anger and frustration and desperation I’ve felt over the years boiled over.  Above all, when the scientist who had discovered the comet was pushed to the bottom of the schedule by fatuous celebrity gossip on a morning TV show and erupted in fury, I was reminded of my own mortifying loss of control on Good Morning Britain in November. It was soon after the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, where we had seen the least serious of all governments (the UK was hosting the talks) failing to rise to the most serious of all issues. I tried, for the thousandth time, to explain what we are facing, and suddenly couldn’t hold it in any longer. I burst into tears on live TV. I still feel deeply embarrassed about it. The response on social media, like the response to the scientist in the film, was vituperative and vicious. I was faking. I was hysterical. I was mentally ill. But, knowing where we are and what we face, seeing the indifference of those who wield power, seeing how our existential crisis has been marginalised in favour of trivia and frivolity, I now realise that there would be something wrong with me if I hadn’t lost it. In fighting any great harm, in any age, we find ourselves confronting the same forces: distraction, denial and delusion. Those seeking to sound the alarm about the gathering collapse of our life-support systems soon hit the barrier that stands between us and the people we are trying to reach, a barrier called the media. With a few notable exceptions, the sector that should facilitate communication thwarts it. It’s not just its individual stupidities that have become inexcusable, such as the platforms repeatedly given to climate deniers. It is the structural stupidity to which the media are committed. It’s the anti-intellectualism, the hostility to new ideas and aversion to complexity. It’s the absence of moral seriousness. It’s the vacuous gossip about celebrities and consumables that takes precedence over the survival of life on Earth. It’s the obsession with generating noise, regardless of signal. It’s the reflexive alignment with the status quo, whatever it may be. It’s the endless promotion of the views of the most selfish and antisocial people, and the exclusion of those who are trying to defend us from catastrophe, on the grounds that they are “worthy”, “extreme” or “mad” (I hear from friends in the BBC that these terms are still used there to describe environmental activists). Even when these merchants of distraction do address the issue, they tend to shut out the experts and interview actors, singers and other celebs instead. The media’s obsession with actors vindicates Guy Debord’s predictions in his book The Society of the Spectacle, published in 1967. Substance is replaced by semblance, as even the most serious issues must now be articulated by people whose work involves adopting someone else’s persona and speaking someone else’s words. Then the same media, having turned them into spokespeople, attack these actors as hypocrites for leading a profligate lifestyle. Similarly, it’s not just the individual failures by governments at Glasgow and elsewhere that have become inexcusable, but the entire framework of negotiations. As crucial Earth systems might be approaching their tipping point, governments still propose to address the issue with tiny increments of action, across decades. It’s as if, in 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed and the global financial system began to sway, governments had announced that they would bail out the banks at the rate of a few million pounds a day between then and 2050. The system would have collapsed 40 years before their programme was complete. Our central, civilisational question, I believe, is this: why do nations scramble to rescue the banks but not the planet? So, as we race towards Earth system collapse, trying to raise the alarm feels like being trapped behind a thick plate of glass. People can see our mouths opening and closing, but they struggle to hear what we are saying. As we frantically bang the glass, we look ever crazier. And feel it. The situation is genuinely maddening. I’ve been working on these issues since I was 22, and full of confidence and hope. I’m about to turn 59, and the confidence is turning to cold fear, the hope to horror. As manufactured indifference ensures that we remain unheard, it becomes ever harder to know how to hold it together. I cry most days now.
