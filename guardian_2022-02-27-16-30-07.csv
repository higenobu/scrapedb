2/27/2022,"China’s decision to abstain on Friday night at the end of the UN security council vote condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine may be a source of deep frustration in the west, but it will also send a nervous tremor through the Russian ministry of foreign affairs that China’s protection is not unconditional. UK-based diplomats, looking at the stance adopted by China in the middle of the week, were expecting Beijing to join Russia in voting against the US-sponsored motion, but in common with the United Arab Emirates and India, it abstained, leaving Russia isolated in deploying its veto power as a permanent member of the security council. At one level, the vote represents the line of least resistance for China, and can be seen as a reversion to the safety of China’s long-standing support for the inviolability of borders, and advocacy of non-interference in the affairs of sovereign states. But there are tentative signs that China is uneasy at being seen to defend Putin’s methods, and the potential disruption to the world economy. Putin may have shown his respect for China by delaying the invasion until after the Winter Olympics, but China was not consulted about the invasion. Chinese diplomats ridiculed forecasts of an invasion, and left many citizens in situ. The deeper partnership agreement signed with Russia on 4 February, the opening day of the Beijing Winter Olympics, was predicated on no invasion. China benefits from the existing world order, and finds the instability unsettling. The prospect of Russia being cut out of the Swift payment system may benefit Chinese efforts to build an alternative, but the short-term disruption is worrying. It was noticeable, for instance, on Friday that Russia offered high-level talks with Ukraine in Minsk, albeit on unacceptable terms, after a conversation between Putin and President Xi Jinping. Before the vote, the Chinese foreign minister took three calls from the foreign secretary Liz Truss, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, and Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic counsellor to President Emmanuel Macron. China said in those calls it reiterated its support for non-interference, and the UN charter, but also expressed sympathy with Russia’s sense that it was threatened by Nato’s five successive rounds of expansion. But even if China contorts itself by stubbornly refusing to describe Putin’s actions as an invasion, it has edged closer to including Russia in its criticism. China on Friday emphasised that “it is absolutely imperative that all parties exercise necessary restraint in order to prevent the situation in Ukraine from deteriorating or even getting out of control. The safety of ordinary people’s lives and properties should be effectively safeguarded, and in particular, large-scale humanitarian crises have to be prevented.” Ukraine, it said, should be a bridge of communication between the east and west, not the frontline of confrontations between major countries. That, by implication, suggests China would favour Ukraine being a neutral state. The risk for Russia is that if it descends into pariah status, it will be left as a supplicant rather than a future partner with China. Within 10 years, Europe will have freed itself from dependence on Russian gas and oil – that has become a matter of urgent imperative in Rome and Berlin. Russia will be reliant on China as a customer. There is a further danger for Russia. China prides itself on its influence in Africa. All the African representatives on the security council voted against Russia. The Kenyan ambassador did so by insisting that he had opposed previous western military interventions. Further wider tests of African opinion are imminent. Washington wants Russia’s culpability to be tested further before the 193-member general assembly at which all members vote. A broad alliance is forming behind Ukraine’s cause. In a debate on Wednesday countries from Guatemala to Turkey to Japan condemned Russia’s embrace of the separatist self-proclaimed republics, or voiced support for Ukraine. In 2014, after the Russian capture of Crimea, the general assembly adopted a resolution declaring Russia’s referendum in Crimea invalid. It received 100 votes in favour, 11 against and 58 abstentions, while two dozen countries didn’t vote. The issues will be slightly different if there is a further vote, but the invasion has been more overt than 2014, social media more pervasive and China, its status growing on the world stage, finds it less easy to hide. With greater power perhaps will come greater responsibility.",News/World news,Ukraine: what will China do?

2/27/2022,"On 24 February, the armor of the “enlightened autocrat” that had housed Vladimir Putin for the previous 20 years cracked and fell to pieces. The world saw a monster –crazed in its desires and ruthless in its decisions. The monster had grown gradually, gaining strength from year to year, marinating in its own absolute authority, imperial aggression, hatred for western democracy, and malice fueled by the resentment engendered by the fall of the USSR. Now, Europe will have to deal, not with the former Putin, but the new Putin who has cast aside his mask of “business partnership” and “peaceful collaboration”. There shall never again be peace with him. How and why has this come to pass? In the final film of Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy, when Frodo Baggins has to throw into the seething lava the cursed Ring of Power, the ring which has brought so much suffering and war to the inhabitants of Middle Earth, he suddenly decides to keep it for himself. And, by the will of the ring, his face suddenly begins to change, becoming evil and sinister. The Ring of Power had taken total possession of him. Even so, in Tolkien’s book, there’s a happy ending … When Putin was put on the throne of Russian power by an ailing Boris Yeltsin in 1999, his face was rather sympathetic, attractive even – and his rhetoric was entirely sound. It seemed to many that the man ascending the heights of the Russian pyramid of power was an intelligent official devoid of pride and arrogance and a modern individual who understood that post-Soviet Russia had only one possible path into the future: democracy. He talked about democracy quite a bit in his interviews back then, promising the citizens of the Russian Federation continued reforms, free elections, freedom of speech, the observance of human rights by the authorities, cooperation with the west, and, most importantly, a constant rotation of those in power. “I have no intention of holding onto this chair!” he said. In Russia, as everyone knows, people still believe in the words and appearances woven by their rulers. And, back then, this man was “an individual pleasant in every respect”, as Nikolai Gogol wrote of his protagonist in Dead Souls: open to discussion, seeking to understand everyone, serious, but not devoid of humor or even the ability to make fun of himself. Furthermore, certain politicians, intellectuals, and political theorists, who are now fierce opponents of Putin and his system, supported him, some of them even passing through the doors of his campaign headquarters to help him win the coming elections. And he did. But the fatal Ring of Russian Power was already on his finger and doing its insidious work; an imperial monster began to take the place of this handsome, lively individual. In Russia, power is a pyramid. This pyramid was built by Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century – an ambitious, brutal tsar overrun by paranoia and a great many other vices. With the help of his personal army – the oprichnina – he cruelly and bloodily divided the Russian state into power and people, friend and foe, and the gap between them became the deepest of moats. His friendship with the Golden Horde convinced him that the only way to rule the hugeness of Russia was by becoming an occupier of this enormous zone. The occupying power had to be strong, cruel, unpredictable, and incomprehensible to the people. The people should have no choice but to obey and worship it. And a single person sits at the peak of this dark pyramid, a single person possessing absolute power and a right to all. Paradoxically, the principle of Russian power hasn’t even remotely changed in the last five centuries. I consider this to be our country’s main tragedy. Our medieval pyramid has stood tall for all that time, its surface changing, but never its fundamental form. And it’s always been a single Russian ruler sitting at its peak: Pyotr I, Nicholas II, Stalin, Brezhnev, Andropov… Today, Putin has been sitting at its peak for more than 20 years. Having broken his promise, he clutches onto his chair with all his might. The Pyramid of Power poisons the ruler with absolute authority. It shoots archaic, medieval vibrations into the ruler and his retinue, seeming to say: “you are the masters of a country whose integrity can only be maintained by violence and cruelty; be as opaque as I am, as cruel and unpredictable, everything is allowed to you, you must call forth shock and awe in your population, the people must not understand you, but they must fear you.” Judging by recent events, the idea of restoring the Russian Empire has entirely taken possession of Putin. Alas, Yeltsin, who came to power on the crest of the wave of Perestroika, did not destroy the pyramid’s medieval form, he simply refurbished its surface: instead of gloomy Soviet concrete, it became colorful and was covered over with billboards advertising western goods. The Pyramid of Power exacerbated Yeltsin’s worst traits: he became rude, a bully, and an alcoholic. His face turned into a heavy, motionless mask of impudent arrogance. Toward the end of his reign, Yeltsin unleashed a senseless war onto Chechnya when it decided to secede from the Russian Federation. The pyramid built by Ivan the Terrible had succeeded in awakening the imperialist even in Yeltsin, only a short-lived democrat; as a Russian tsar, he sent tanks and bombers into Chechnya, dooming the Chechen people to death and suffering. Yeltsin and the other creators of Perestroika surrounding him not only didn’t destroy the vicious Pyramid of Power, they didn’t bury their Soviet past either – unlike the post-war Germans who buried the corpse of their nazism in the 1950s. The corpse of this monster, which had annihilated tens of millions of its own citizens and thrown its country back 70 years into the past, was propped up in a corner: it’ll rot on its own, they thought. But it turned out not to be dead. After coming to power, Putin began to change. And those who initially welcomed his reign gradually understood that these changes didn’t bode well for Russia. The TV channel NTV was destroyed, other channels began to pass into the hands of Putin’s comrades-in-arms, after which a regime of strict censorship came into effect; from that point forward, Putin was beyond criticism. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the head of the richest and most successful company in Russia, was arrested and imprisoned for 10 years. His company Yukos was looted by Putin’s friends. This “special operation” was designed to intimidate the other oligarchs. And it did: some of them left the country, but the rest swore allegiance to Putin, some of them even becoming his “coin purses”. The Pyramid of Power was vibrating and its vibrations stopped time. Like a huge iceberg, the county was floating through the past – first its Soviet past, then only its medieval past. Putin declared that the collapse of the USSR was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century. For all clear-headed Soviet people, its collapse had been a blessing; it was impossible to find a single family unscathed by the Red Wheel of Stalinist Repressions. Millions were annihilated. Tens of millions were poisoned by the fumes of communism – an unattainable goal requiring moral and physical sacrifices by Soviet citizens. But Putin didn’t manage to outgrow the KGB officer inside of him, the officer who’d been taught that the USSR was the greatest hope for the progress of mankind and that the west was an enemy capable only of corruption. Launching his time machine into the past, it was as if he were returning to his Soviet youth, during which he’d been so comfortable. He gradually forced all of his subjects to return there as well. The perversity of the Pyramid of Power lies in the fact that he who sits at its peak broadcasts his psychosomatic condition to the country’s entire population. The ideology of Putinism is quite eclectic; in it, respect for the Soviet lies side by side with feudal ethics, Lenin sharing a bed with Tsarist Russian and Russian Orthodox Christianity. Putin’s favorite philosopher is Ivan Ilyin – a monarchist, Russian nationalist, anti-Semite, and ideologist of the White movement, who was expelled by Lenin from Soviet Russia in 1922 and ended his life in exile. When Hitler came to power in Germany, Ilyin congratulated him hotly for “bringing the Bolshevization of Germany to a halt”. “I categorically refuse to evaluate the events of the last three months in Germany from the perspective of German Jews … The liberal-democratic hypnosis of non-resistance has been cast off …” he wrote. However, when Hitler declared the Slavs to be a second-class race, Ilyin was offended and the Gestapo soon took him into custody for the criticisms he’d begun to level. He was then rescued by Sergei Rachmaninov, after which he left for Switzerland. In his articles, Ilyin hoped that, after the fall of Bolshevism, Russia would have its own great führer, who would bring the country up from its knees. Indeed, “Russia rising from its knees” is the preferred slogan of Putin and of his Putinists. It was also taking his cue from Ilyin that he spoke contemptuously of a Ukrainian state “created by Lenin”. In fact, the independent Ukraine was not created by Lenin, but by the Central Rada in January 1918, immediately after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by Lenin. This state arose because of Lenin’s aggression, but not thanks to his efforts. Ilyin was convinced that if, after the Bolsheviks, the authorities in Russia were “[to become] anti-national and anti-state, obsequious toward foreigners, [to dismember] the country, [to become] patriotically unprincipled, not exclusively protecting the interests of the great Russian nation without any regard for whorish Lesser Russians [Ukrainians], to whom Lenin gave statehood, then the revolution [would] not end, but enter its new phase of perishing from western decadence.” “Under Putin, Russia has gotten up from its knees!” his supporters often chant. Someone once joked: the country got up from its knees, but quickly got down onto all fours: corruption, authoritarianism, bureaucratic arbitrariness, and poverty. Now we might add another: war. A lot has happened in the last 20 years. The president of the Russian Federation’s face has turned into an impenetrable mask, radiating cruelty, anger, and discontent. His main instrument of communication has become lies – lies small and big, naively superficial and highly structured, lies he seems to believe himself and lies he doesn’t. Russians are already accustomed to their president’s lie-filled rhetoric. But, now, he’s also inured Europeans to those lies. Yet another head of a European country flies to the Kremlin so as to listen through their traditional portion of fantastical lies (now at an enormous, totally paranoid table), to nod their head, to say that “the dialogue turned out to be fairly constructive” at a press conference, then to just fly away. Merkel admitted that, in her opinion, Putin lives in his own fantasy land. If that’s so, what’s the point of seriously engaging with such a ruler? He’s not a writer or an artist, he has to live in the real world and be responsible for every single one of his words. For 16 years, Merkel, who grew up in the GDR and should therefore understand Putin’s true nature, “has established a dialogue”. The results of that dialogue: the seizure of certain territories in Georgia, the annexation of Crimea, the capture of the DPR and LPR, and now: a full-scale war with Ukraine. After the war with Georgia and the seizure of its territories, the “peacemaker” Obama offered Putin … a reset of their relations! Which is to say, c’mon, Vladimir, let’s forget all of that and start from scratch. The result of that “reset” was the annexation of Crimea and the war in Eastern Ukraine. Putin’s inner monster wasn’t just brought up by our Pyramid of Power and the corrupt Russian elite, to whom Putin, like the tsar to the satraps, throws fat, juicy bits of corruption from his table. It was also cultivated by the approval of irresponsible western politicians, cynical businessmen, and corrupt journalists and political scientists. “A strong and consistent ruler!” This bewitched them. “A new Russian tsar” was, for them, something like Russian vodka and caviar: invigorating! During this period of time, I met many admirers of Putin in Germany, from taxi drivers to businessmen and professors. One aged participant in the student revolution of ’68 confessed: “I really like your Putin!” “And why exactly is that?” “He’s strong. Tells the truth. And he’s against America. Not like the slugs we’ve got here.” “And it doesn’t bother you that, in Russia, there’s monstrous corruption, there are practically no elections or independent courts, the opposition is being destroyed, the provinces are impoverished, Nemtsov was murdered, and TV’s become propaganda?” “No. Those are your internal affairs. If Russians accept all of that and don’t protest, that must mean they like Putin.” Ironclad logic. The experience of Germany in the ’30s didn’t seem to have taught such Europeans anything. But I hope most Europeans aren’t like that. That they know the difference between democracy and dictatorship – between war and peace. In his lie-filled address, Putin called the attack on Ukraine a “military special operation” against “Ukrainian aggressors”. Which is to say: the peace-loving Russia first annexed Crimea from the “Ukrainian junta”, then unleashed a hybrid war in eastern Ukraine, and is now attacking the whole country. Pretty much exactly like Stalin with Finland in ’39. For Putin, life itself has always been a special operation. From the black order of the KGB, he learned not only contempt for “normal” people, always a form of expendable matter for the Soviet Moloch-state, but also the Chekist’s main principle: not a single word of truth. Everything must be hidden away, classified. His personal life, relatives, habits – everything has always been hidden, overgrown with rumors and speculation. Now, one thing has become clear: with this war, Putin has crossed a line – a red line. The mask is off, the armor of the “enlightened autocrat” has cracked. Now, all westerners who sympathize with the “strong Russian tsar” have to shut up and realize that a full-scale war is being unleashed in 21st-century Europe. The aggressor is Putin’s Russia. It will bring nothing but death and destruction to Europe. This war was unleashed by a man corrupted by absolute power, who, in his madness, has decided to redraw the map of our world. If you listen to Putin’s speech announcing a “special operation”, America and Nato are mentioned more than Ukraine. Let us also recall his recent “ultimatum” to Nato. As such, his goal isn’t Ukraine, but western civilization, the hatred for which he lapped up in the black milk he drank from the KGB’s teat. Who’s to blame? Us. Russians. And we’ll now have to bear this guilt until Putin’s regime collapses. For it surely will collapse and the attack on a free Ukraine is the beginning of the end. Putinism is doomed because it’s an enemy of freedom and an enemy of democracy. People have finally understood this today. He attacked a free and democratic country precisely because it is a free and democratic country. But he’s the one who’s doomed because the world of freedom and democracy is far bigger than his dark and gloomy lair. Doomed because what he wants is a new Middle Ages, corruption, lies, and trampling on human freedoms. Because he is the past. And we must do everything in our power to make this monster remain there – in the past – for all time, together with his Pyramid of Power.

2/27/2022,"Footage captured by a CNN crew of the deployment of a T0S-1 heavy flame thrower system which was filmed being transported towards the Ukrainian border on Saturday has focused increased attention on what weapons Russia is beginning to deploy and how indiscriminate they are. The TOS-1, nicknamed the “Buratino” – the Russian version of Pinocchio – for its big nose, is one of the most feared weapons systems in Russia’s conventional armoury, a multiple launch rocket system mounted on the chassis of a T-72 tank capable of firing thermobaric rockets which use oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. First deployed by the Soviet military in Afghanistan, the TOS-1 was used most recently in Syria. The deployment of the TOS-1 comes as Russian forces and separatist allies have already used the indiscriminate BM-21 “Grad” multiple launch rocket system during the course of their invasion of Ukraine including in the country’s east and in the country’s south. They appear to have been deployed around Kharkiv where images of a destroyed BM-21 and a dead Russian serviceman have circulated. The Bellingcat investigative website has also been collecting evidence of the suspected use of Uragan and Smerch cluster rockets and their submunitions from the current fighting in Ukraine. The use of both multiple launch rocket systems and cruise missiles against civilian areas during the invasion has already been condemned. “The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general. She warned: “Some of these attacks may be war crimes. The Russian government, which falsely claims to use only precision-guided weapons, should take responsibility for these acts.” While many of the weapons systems so far used during the Russian invasion have been largely conventional – including versions of the T-72 tank and BMP3 armoured fighting vehicles – and Mi8 and Ka-52 helicopters, concern has been raised over the Russian use of Kalibr cruise missiles, particularly against built up areas. There have been reports of Kalibrs – which can be fired from ships, aircraft and submarines – being used against Kyiv and also against the southern port city of Odesa.

2/27/2022,"Social media influencers are often maligned for their vapidity, but as the Russian army moves across Ukraine some of Russia’s biggest digital influencers have become beacons of resistance. Many are speaking out about their unease at the speed and brutality with which the Russian president is leading his country to war. Ukrainian influencers, meanwhile, are also braving the risks of attack from the advancing army to make sure to document the horror of war in mainland Europe. Some of Russia’s biggest names in the digital sphere have spoken out against war. The daughter of Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s press secretary, posted a message reading “No to war” on her Instagram story, before quickly deleting it. Max Galkin, the husband of Alla Pugacheva, and one of Russia’s biggest stars, posted a black square on Instagram and the message “Нет войне!” (“no to war!”) to his 9.4m followers. Fashion designer Svetlana Taccori took time out of Milan fashion week to post a photo holding a Ukrainian flag and the same message. Influencer Lova Olala painted the Russian and Ukrainian flag on each cheek and the caption “I have nothing to say”. The independent Russian journalist Ilya Varlamov has posted regular photos and videos highlighting Russian brutality, calling for a cessation of violence in Ukraine.

To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Niki Proshin, a 27-year-old Russian TikToker with 750,000 followers, started posting about the invasion of Ukraine as soon as Russian troops crossed the border. He posted a single video to TikTok addressing the many questions he received from his followers asking for his thoughts on Ukraine. He spoke out about the war, and about his anger that Vladimir Putin launched the attack at night. “Showing my opinion publicly helps foreigners understand Russian people more and helps to keep the bridge between normal people outside of Russia, and normal people in Russia,” says Proshin. He followed it up with another video, taken live at street protests in his home city of St Petersburg. Yet many of his friends spoke out, choosing to post images of black squares on Instagram or videos speaking out against the invasion. “The current situation touched us much more than the events of the last year,” he said. Xenia Tchoumitcheva, born in the Russian mountain city of Magnitogorsk, chose a black and white picture of an espresso as the backdrop for her pronouncement on the invasion. “In my veins run both Russian and Ukrainian blood,” she wrote. “I don’t have any political knowledge nor opinion, but all I can say is: I am always against war and for the people,” she wrote to her 2 million followers. The risk for Russian influencers, celebrities and journalists in speaking out against the Russian dictator is obvious – those who don’t toe the government line can find themselves arrested or worse, as those being arrested for protesting on the streets in Russia know well. But considering their reach, a well-timed statement to millions on Instagram or TikTok can inflict considerable reputational damage to Putin’s claims of unity behind his cause. “This is something pretty common that comes from both Ukrainian and Russian influencers,” says Roman Kolodko, chief operating officer of eastern European influencer marketing agency Mediacube, which represents a number of Russian and Ukrainian creators. Kolodko spoke as he fled Ukraine for Poland. “Many big influencers are in Ukrainian cities that have been and are being attacked right now, and they need to spread their word,” he added – and those who aren’t have family there. Ukrainian influencers who remain in the country have adapted their content to match the changed circumstances of their new lives under the shadow of invasion. Until yesterday, Anna Prytula’s Instagram feed looked like any other relatively large influencer’s: impossibly perfect cakes, overflowing bouquets of flowers and oodles of boxes and bags from Louis Vuitton lined the frame of her feed. Her lifestyle was lapped up by her million followers, 71% of whom are Ukrainian, and 16% of whom are Russian. Then Russian boots trampled over Ukraine, and alarmingly close to Prytula’s home city of Lviv. Suddenly Prytula’s posts changed. Gone were the impossibly glam photos outside luxury hotels; in their place, a stark red square with white text: “at 5am Russia is attacking the territory of Ukraine”. Her Instagram stories changed soon afterwards from glimpses into her glamorous life to footage of missiles raining down over her homeland, pleas to Nato to intervene, and advice on how to find help and where to hide. #NoToWar - was just posted by the daughter of the Kremlin Press Secretary, Lisa Peskova. pic.twitter.com/sJFA6byMUV As reality intrudes into the western order’s way of thinking about Russia’s attitude to risk, so too has the hyperreal, polished world of social media has been hit with a reality check. Ukrainian travel blogger Elena Mandziuk showed her million followers how to make molotov cocktails on her Instagram stories. Mary Furtas, a Ukrainian entrepreneur with nearly 55,000 followers, pivoted her profile to post overtly political pleas on 19 February. On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, like Prytula, she posted a similar red square. The text, however, was different: “Every Russian is responsible for this,” she wrote. It hasn’t escaped TikTok users’ notice that the app’s For You feed has been filled with videos about events in Ukraine. Most people who study it believe the TikTok algorithm rewards people who are speaking about current events. Some of those are legitimate, informative videos – Ukrainian-British TikToker Marta Vasyuta has shared with the world the destructive aftermath of Russian attacks from around the country, acting as a one-woman content curation desk fuelled by righteous anger – but others are chasing likes. The app has struggled with misrepresentative or outright faked live streams and videos that are designed either to confuse or to capitalise on interest in Ukraine. But those who are authentic will continue posting content – and for good reason. Proshin, the Russian TikToker who felt he had to speak out, says his posts aren’t political, but instead connect at a human level with the rest of the world. “I hope we’ll make people understand that ‘Russian people’ is not equal to the Russian government,” he says. “Some Russian people support the political decisions of our government, but from my personal perspective, they’re a minority. In this situation, ‘Russia’ equals ‘people who can make decisions’. The majority of my friends have no power to make decisions.”",News/Media,The first TikTok war: how are influencers in Russia and Ukraine responding?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/26/social-media-influencers-russia-ukraine-tiktok-instagram
2/27/2022,"“Iwill not pretend this will be painless,” Joe Biden warned Americans before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And as the war disrupts already hard-hit international trade, US consumers are likely to soon see just how painful the consequences of the conflict will be in the US. Inflation is already at a 40-year high in the US and, depending on the length and depth of Russia’s war, any further disruption could cause prices to rise at the pump and perhaps on store shelves. The invasion could also have potential long-term implications for Biden’s green energy transition since a significant amount of key metals are mined and produced there, including nickel, palladium and aluminum. While US-Russian trade is relatively small, the country is home to a broad range of natural resources, from crude oil to wheat. Prices for those natural resources soared following Russia’s incursion, although most are off the highs they hit when the invasion began. On Thursday, Nymex futures prices for the most active crude oil and gasoline contracts – an indication of the future cost of buying oil – spiked to their highest levels since July 2014, with the US benchmark West Texas Intermediate briefly touching $100 a barrel and reformulated gasoline prices rising as high as $3.07 a gallon. Wheat prices continued their climb on Friday as fighting continued. Chicago Board of Trade wheat prices were trending higher before Russia’s invasion, but spiked higher still on Thursday and Friday, rising at one point to their highest level since April 2008. Russia and Ukraine collectively are known as Europe’s breadbasket, responsible for 30% of the world’s export supply of wheat. Much of that is shipped through the Black Sea to the Middle East and African countries, which take advantage of lower prices and shipping costs from the region. Uncertainty regarding Russian president Vladimir Putin’s intention are inflating commodity prices across the board, but wheat prices also remain high because of significantly tight global supplies. Dry weather conditions in the US and in other top-growing regions globally limited harvests, and the Covid pandemic increased demand while snarling logistics. In addition to poor weather, many US farmers preferred to plant corn and soya beans versus wheat because of persistently low prices, with sowings last year at 100-year lows. Low global wheat stocks will make it harder for other countries such as the US, Canada and Australia to cover a possible global shortfall out of Ukraine, “and now you have a war in that area. Where this (prices) will go is a major, major question mark,” said Sean Lusk, vice-president of the commercial hedging division for Walsh Trading. With inflation up 7.5% in January over last year, higher food and energy costs are already the two biggest concerns consumers have right now, said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Wealth Management. Food prices rose 7% year-over-year in the January consumer prices index report, while energy costs gained 27%. The ramifications of Russia’s invasion are most likely to appear first at the gas station. Further increases in energy costs come as the world is already dealing with critically low energy inventories. Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, says the current futures prices for gasoline could translate to $4 a gallon for retail prices in a few weeks, up from the current national average of $3.54. “That’s going to be an enormous political problem,” Hatfield said. US crude oil production is slowly increasing, but it won’t be enough to make inventories rise, said Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials and energy at consultancy Third Bridge. Part of the US’s problem is refinery capacity, which fell by a 1m-plus barrels a day during the pandemic, limiting how much fuel can be produced. That could be a problem for the summer driving season when demand peaks. “We’ve got a couple months here to see if we can build enough product inventory to meet that demand,” he said. The Federal Reserve was poised to raise interest rates next month to combat higher inflation, but the Russian conflict adds to the central bank’s problem, Haworth said, which will have to weigh a geopolitical shock with an aggressive attempt to tame inflation. One long-term implication if the Russian-Ukraine war continues is how commodity producers and end-users grapple with the global push for clean energy investment. Russia is a major nickel miner, a metal used in battery production, and aluminum, used in most industrial products. It also is a top palladium producer, used in catalytic converters. So far, western nations haven’t targeted commodity exports and Russia hasn’t stopped sales. But the commodity experts point out there’s been several years of low capital investment across the complex, which led to reduced inventories, even before Covid messed up supply chains. Building infrastructure, such as new mines, takes years. Roland Harris, portfolio manager for the commodity index strategy at VanEck, says the energy transition story is going to play out over a number of years, meanwhile, supply issues will take a while to work out. He thinks inflation will be much longer-lasting, whether it’s trade disputes or countries trying to secure their own national resources. That’s going to hit US consumers long-term at a time where prices are already high. “We’re seeing the end of globalization. Trade friction, countries trying to secure resources, all those things are inflationary,” he said.",News/Business,US inflation is at a 40-year high.

Troy was big-hearted, kind, the best fisherman around, a devoted father who cared for the kids during the day after long night shifts as a firefighter.

His doctor prescribed OxyContin, and that was the beginning of the end. “Everything just went downhill,” Stephanie said. Troy suffered a decades-long battle with opioid use disorder.

Stephanie is one of more than 138,000 claimants alleging that the Sackler family and its company, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, contributed to the ongoing opioid epidemic. The Sacklers deny wrongdoing. Facing about 3,000 lawsuits, Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019, but not before Sackler family members took more than $10 bn from the company over the course of a decade. This case, brought by states and victims of opioids, is now being settled in bankruptcy court. But it is proving difficult to settle. A previous agreement was blocked in December. After intense negotiations, the Sackler family is now offering $6 bn in settlement negotiations, paid out over several years. The family insists on civil liability protection, however, which would essentially mean they can never be sued in civil courts over opioids ever again – an unusual step that scuppered the last deal. Such measures are typically used in bankruptcy court to help restructure a company, but they aren’t used to protect the owners from liability when they’re not declaring bankruptcy themselves, as in this case. “That’s clearly the sticking point,” said Regina LaBelle, former acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and current director of the Addiction and Public Policy Initiative at Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute, “being able to bring action against the Sacklers personally in the future.” While most parties have agreed to these terms, some are still holding out. A federal bankruptcy judge, Shelley Chapman, who is mediating the settlement, has asked for an extension until the end of the month. A stay against other claims during the settlement negotiations is set to expire in early March. Previously, the Sacklers offered $4.55 bn, but eight states and the District of Columbia objected to that amount. The family has now added nearly $1 bn, as well as proceeds from the sale of international drug companies. The additional funds would not go to victims, like Stephanie Lubinski, but to governments for law enforcement and health care costs associated with opioids. Victims are set to receive a total of $750 million – about $5,000 each. More than 500,000 Americans have died from overdoses in the past two decades. “Any of these people who lost their lives or were affected by addiction, no amount of money is going to compensate them. No amount of money,” LaBelle said. “Absolutely, it’s not enough – the $750 million is a joke,” said Ryan Hampton, the former co-chair of the creditor’s committee representing victims in the settlement, who is in recovery himself. “It should have been double that, at a minimum.” But if a settlement isn’t reached, it seems unlikely that this many victims will be able to form a new settlement before other claims are made. Those whose lives were harmed by opioids “stand to lose the most in these negotiations if they fall apart,” he said. “There is going to be a settlement or some sort of a civil action that the Sacklers are going to have to take. The underlying factor here is whether victims are going to receive any sort of direct compensation out of that settlement.” If this settlement dissolves, other states could bring their own claims, edging out victims entirely, he said. “​​There’s a possibility that one state recovers all of the sack of money and doesn’t share it with the rest of the states and certainly doesn’t share it with the victims who have claims,” Hampton said. “There needs to be a settlement and a conclusion to this bankruptcy that does not exclude the $750 million for victims. That would be a crime in itself if this entire thing falls apart and victims receive nothing.” The bankruptcy process is, “unfortunately, not ideal for meting out justice for people in this type of litigation in particular, where you have real people with human stories who have been affected by the actions of this company,” LaBelle said. “I can’t believe we’re this far down the road and we’re still trying to get justice to people who are affected,” she said. But “if we’re able to resolve this and get money to states and local governments and individuals so that we can start building the type of addiction system that we need in this country, then we can start moving forward.” In this settlement, Purdue would be restructured as a public benefit corporation that produces naloxone, a medication reversing opioid overdoses with soaring prices for harm reduction groups last year. “Reducing the harms associated with opioid use disorder certainly has to be part of the calculus,” LaBelle said. “It’s an ongoing saga that we haven’t gotten to the end of yet, and we need to start healing people. We need to start moving forward.” As Troy Lubinski’s opioid use disorder continued through the years, it affected everything. He stopped making mortgage payments, unbeknownst to his wife, and they lost their house. He pawned any possessions of value. When he finally went into substance use treatment, Troy told the doctor he was taking 40 pills a day – a revelation that shocked his wife. “I just fell on the floor, in a fetal position,” Stephanie said. “How did I not know? How was I not there for him? How did I not know this was all going on?” But the treatment didn’t keep him from opioids for long, and after that, he became paranoid and delusional, Stephanie said. “I felt so bad for him, because that was his reality. And you can’t defend yourself against things that aren’t real.” Troy moved away, and Stephanie filed for divorce to protect what little she had left, though she still refers to him as her husband. “I still felt like he was gonna come back to us,” she said through tears. Troy did move back, and for a brief, hopeful time, it seemed he had finally changed. But then something shifted in him once more. Troy took his own life in September 2020. Stephanie had already joined the settlement by then, but after Troy died, she needed his story to be told. “I needed to write the letter, you know, instead of just a claim number,” she said. “I believe the Sackler family should know what their greed has caused. They should know the name, Troy Lubinksi, and the many, many others that have lost their lives to OxyContin,” she wrote in a letter to the judge presiding over the settlement. But she didn’t join the settlement to memorialize Troy. Nor is she doing it for herself. In 2017, Stephanie was diagnosed with a rare stage-4 cancer. She was given three to five years to live. She is pressing the Sacklers for restitution because she wants to leave something behind for their kids, who were now young adults. “I filed for them,” Stephanie said. “My kids deserve it after everything they’ve been through, everything they’ve lost. “I knew I wasn’t going to be around to see anything. But I wanted them to have something.”",News/US news,OxyContin victims fight for their share in Purdue bankruptcy case,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/oxycontin-victims-sacklers-perdue-pharma-bankruptcy-opioid-crisis
2/27/2022,"Jason Au took this picture in a shopping mall atrium one Sunday afternoon in Hong Kong in December 2020. At the beginning of that month, with Covid cases rising again, restrictions had been reintroduced that encouraged all residents to stay at home and limited groups to two people. Each group had to be 1.5 metres from one another. The shadows on the floor of the shopping centre created a natural grid for this social distancing. Au’s photograph was part of a series that saw him shortlisted last week, from among 156,000 entrants, for this year’s Sony World Photography awards in the architecture and design category. Au has been taking pictures seriously since 2017. He is drawn to environments, he says, “that can create a geometric context”; the sunlit shopping centre matrix was perfect for his purposes, and the Covid regulations added to the formal symmetries. Through his lens, he suggests, he waits to “see people look trapped and lost inside an artificial geometric labyrinth without realising it – perhaps this is a metaphorical view of urbanity and the hectic contemporary way of life in modern cities like Hong Kong”. That vision, always in black and white, seems a personal response to the clamour and colour of his city; Au’s camera looks for moments of stillness and clarity, finding ways to control the chaos. “Photography is a realistic art form,” he says. “However, black and white has the quality to strip away realism. You’re looking straight into the forms, gestures and soul of your photographic subjects.” In recent years, street scenes from Hong Kong have been synonymous with occupation and youthful protest; in this sense, though Au insists on an aesthetic rather than a political intent, his locked-down images, from the long year of indoors, appear doubly poignant.

2/27/2022,"27 June 1842, a date no one has ever celebrated, marked the real birth of modern New York City. On that date, people passing a new 150m-gallon reservoir that stretched from Sixth to Seventh Avenue and between 79th and 86th Streets suddenly noticed it was filling up with water. The flood had traveled 34 miles, from Westchester county. The Lenape, the original residents of Manhattan, survived for thousands of years on water from streams and ponds. But their Dutch and British successors polluted all those sources and the ground water too. By the beginning of the 19th century, New Yorkers were adding brandy or gin to every glass of water – as a disinfectant. The surge in population that began when the Erie Canal was completed in 1825 made a new source of water essential. Cholera epidemics in 1832 and 1834 plus the great fire of 1835 finally convinced the city to approve a gigantic expenditure of $8m, which ballooned to $13m before the project was completed. On that fateful 27 June, Mayor Robert Morris, members of the common council, a 78-year-old John Jacob Astor and 15,000 other New Yorkers formed a gigantic crowd around the gushing waters. Troops were called out to deliver a 34-gun salute: one blast for each mile the water had traveled. The festivities continued with the grand opening on 4 July of the Murray Hill Distributing Reservoir at 42nd Street, later the site of the New York Public Library. In October an even larger celebration featured a seven-hour parade which ended downtown at a new fountain in front of City Hall, its center jet shooting water 50ft into the air. Governor William Seward toasted the way “today the pure mountain stream gushes through” the city’s streets “and sparkles in its squares”. Daniel Levy’s sprawling new history of 19th-century New York, Manhattan Phoenix, is subtitled “The Great Fire of 1835 and the Emergence of Modern New York”. The author argues, a little implausibly, that it was that conflagration that gave birth to the modern city. But he is thorough enough to include a detailed description of a much more important water project, the Croton Aqueduct, and passing references to the equally crucial Erie Canal, which determined New York’s status as the premier American metropolis. Levy does a fine job of charting New York’s explosion after 1835, when Manhattan had 268,089 people and Columbia University 100 students. He reminds us regularly that so many of the shortcomings some think of as 21st-century problems have been in the city’s DNA for hundreds of years. In the late 1820s, the “richest 4%” controlled nearly half of New York’s wealth, the top 1% almost a third. An Episcopalian reverend named William Muhlenberg railed against “that inordinate spirit of money making, which marks our country in general, and its commercial cities in particular”. Twenty years after Pierre Charles L’Enfant laid out Washington DC “with ovals and diagonal” layouts, the New York commissioners chose a rigid grid of perpendicular streets and avenues. They did so, Levy writes, because they were “focused entirely on growth. In the New York Sunday Dispatch, a young Walt Whitman complained that ‘streets cutting each other at right angles are certainly the last things in the world consistent with beauty of situation’.” Seven years later, Whitman identified the “general principle, that in New York City, among all ranks, except the poorest, there is a habit of occupying houses outrageously and absurdly too expensive”. Already, in the middle of the 19th century, working-class New Yorkers were being priced out of Manhattan and exploring the Bronx and Brooklyn. Levy celebrates many of Manhattan’s earliest glories, including Alexander Stewart’s Marble Palace, the world’s first real department store, which included a four-story atrium and plate-glass windows. He also has a wonderful description of the lengths that New York went to in order to lure Charles Dickens to visit. “Tickets at $5 a piece were sold to 3,000 revelers to welcome the novelist appropriately. One hundred forty chefs and kitchen staff worked for three days to prepare 50 hams, 50 tongues and an astonishing 38,000 oysters, which were by far the city’s most popular food. As Dickens circulated around the room with his wife Catherine, musicians serenaded him with God Save the Queen and Yankee Doodle.” At times, Levy’s descriptions become so detailed one wonders if he felt compelled to include every single fact he uncovered about the city he adores. But anyone who shares his enthusiasm for America’s most important city will treasure this book, for its good judgement and its many unexpected pleasures.

2/27/2022,"Australian basketballer Nathan Sobey has appealed to the public for information after his Olympics bronze medal was stolen from his home in Brisbane. The Boomers and Brisbane Bullets guard was part of the national team that won Australia’s first men’s basketball medal at last year’s Tokyo Olympics by beating Slovenia to bronze. But Sobey on Sunday revealed his house had been broken into overnight and the medal taken. “Unfortunately last night, our house was broken into and my bronze medal was stolen along with some other small things,” he tweeted. “If anyone out there has any information please let us know.” The Boomers posted a similar message to the team’s official Instagram account. The achievement was particularly cherished for the 31-year-old because he had not originally been included in the squad but earned a call-up thanks to his terrific NBL season with the Bullets. Following the Boomers’ win in Tokyo, Sobey and Matthew Dellavedova posed as doctors and talked their way into a hospital in Japan’s capital city to present severely injured teammate Aron Baynes with his bronze medal. It comes as Ben Simmons deals with back soreness as the Brooklyn Nets’ new acquisition prepares to make his 2021-22 debut. Nets coach Steve Nash confirmed before Saturday’s game with the Milwaukee Bucks that the three-time All-Star has encountered “just a little soreness in his back”. “It’s not like an injury,” Nash said. “It’s just kind of like as he’s returning to play, his back’s flared up a little. It’s not like a long-term thing.” The Nets acquired the 6-foot-10 guard/forward along with Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and two future first-round picks in a Feb. 10 trade that sent 10-time All-Star James Harden and Paul Millsap to the Philadelphia 76ers. Simmons, the No 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft, has not played since the 76ers fell to the Atlanta Hawks in last season’s Eastern Conference semifinals. He demanded a trade last summer.“He hasn’t played a game since June,” Nash said. “I think that’s just a part of his process of returning to play. As you ramp up, you’re a little bit susceptible to certain things, as you would be with muscle soreness or tightness.” While speaking to reporters after the trade, Simmons said he hoped to play again by the time the Nets visit Philadelphia on 10 March.",Sport/Sport,Australian basketballer Nathan Sobey has Olympic bronze medal stolen,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/27/australian-basketballer-nathan-sobey-has-olympic-bronze-medal-stolen
