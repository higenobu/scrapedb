4/13/2022,"It was a shock but also a logical end point, the surprise that you knew could be coming. Although a visibly stunned Thomas Müller insisted after full-time on Tuesday that “an [equalising] goal wasn’t in the air”, Samuel Chukwueze’s late goal for Villarreal that ousted Bayern Munich from the Champions League was a sucker punch via a predictable route. Although on paper Bayern had breezed past Red Bull Salzburg in the last round, they had diced with danger – Kingsley Coman equalising late in the first leg after Salzburg had worn themselves out. Matthias Jaissle’s young team even had the better chances early in the Allianz Arena return before shooting themselves in the foot defensively. Unai Emery’s Villarreal had the experience and sang froid that the Austrian champions hadn’t. Domestically in recent weeks, Bayern have offered Borussia Dortmund routes back into the Bundesliga title race that Marco Rose’s side haven’t been good enough to take. Part of the issue has been Julian Nagelsmann’s stubbornness. Bayern have played some undeniably fantastic football this season but they have often looked careless – and given the sheer recklessness of some of the team’s play under Hansi Flick, that’s saying something. It has felt for some time that they have been playing with one attacking midfielder too many, although that has been partly to do with the four-month absence of the recently returned Leon Goretzka, and Nagelsmann has not seen fit to change. “I’ve been asked the question 1,734 times in the last few weeks,” he said after a recent draw at Hoffenheim. When it mattered, his team were too easy to cut through, while lacking attacking fluency with Leroy Sané and Serge Gnabry not in their best form. Whether Nagelsmann has the squad to change tack between games is the question. Personnel is the main issue, and the main mitigating factor for the coach. “Better challengers must be added” to the first XI players, wrote Kicker’s Karlheinz Wild on Wednesday. “It’s going to be a difficult job. Finance dictates unwelcome constraints … and imagination is required for structural reforms.” Improving the squad is one thing. Doing it when Robert Lewandowski, Manuel Neuer, Müller and Gnabry are out of contract in 2023 is even trickier. Losing Gnabry, the present and the future at 26, is unthinkable. The issue, though – which bleeds into the other potential renewals for the experienced cornerstones of the team – is that it will cost Bayern, particularly in the wake of Coman signing a new deal in January estimated to pay him €17m a year, before bonuses. The scenario of Bayern coughing up for all of Gnabry, Neuer, Müller and Lewandowski is difficult to envisage. It’s the policy that led to Niklas Süle signing for Borussia Dortmund from this summer – much to Nagelsmann’s displeasure – and has always been thus at Bayern, with that willingness to set limits prompting the exits of Toni Kroos and David Alaba in the past, for example. You can’t pay everybody what they want. That means some tough choices await and the work of Hasan Salihamidžić, who has never universally convinced as sporting director and frequently clashed with Flick on squad planning, will be under scrutiny too. Bayern TV after drawing Villarreal, with sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic chuckling along: “Let’s put it this way: it’s a very manageable draw.” *chuckles* HT @mxnu1893 pic.twitter.com/wUUOaAiw1x There is a need, as Nagelsmann has agreed with the club’s decision makers, for a big defensive restructure. Dayot Upamecano, who gave another shaky performance in the return against Villarreal, is taking time to settle, and it is legitimate to ask whether Lucas Hernandez and Benjamin Pavard have truly justified their significant transfer fees (the former remains, by some distance, Bayern’s record signing at €80m). The departures of Alaba and Jérôme Boateng last summer stripped the defence of a great deal of experience and Nagelsmann has been juggling expectations while dealing with that. This is the first major test of Oliver Kahn since he was elevated to the CEO position. Bayern are so associated with strength and continuity off the pitch that it has been easy for the rest of Europe not to notice the profound changes in the club’s boardroom. Kahn will be expected to act decisively to move on from the disappointment – although Nagelsmann, a long-term project for the club, is likely to be safe. As Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Philipp Selldorf pointed out on Wednesday, the former powerbrokers Uli Hoeness, and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge “will be listening carefully” to Kahn’s forthcoming public statement. “We lost it in the first leg,” said Nagelsmann on Tuesday night. Bayern’s inability to react to that setback means they must move quickly to retain their place among Europe’s elite.",Sport/Football,Bayern Munich face uncertain future after exit that wasn’t such a shock,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/bayern-munich-uncertain-future-champions-league-exit-lewandowski-neuer-muller-gnabry-nagelsmann
4/13/2022,"Scott Morrison has effectively abandoned his promise to establish a federal anti-corruption watchdog, confirming he would only proceed with legislation in the new parliament if Labor agreed to pass the Coalition’s heavily criticised proposal without amendments. Morrison pledged before the 2019 election to legislate a federal integrity body in the parliamentary term that has just ended. The prime minister broke that promise, failing to introduce his own proposal before the 46th parliament was prorogued. On the hustings on Wednesday, Morrison was asked – given his previous undertaking to create the body – whether he would promise to put his proposal to a vote in the next parliament in the event the Coalition won the 21 May election. Morrison declined to make that promise. “Our position on this hasn’t changed,” the prime minister said. “Our view has been the same – when the Labor party is prepared to support that legislation in that form, then we will proceed with it.” The prime minister has attempted to inoculate himself from criticism about breaking an election promise by saying he tabled the integrity commission proposal in the parliament. Tabling an exposure draft, which is what the prime minister did, is not the same as introducing finished legislation to the House of Representatives or the Senate that is then debated and voted on. As well as repeatedly fudging what happened in parliament, Morrison has also created the impression the proposal can only proceed if Labor agrees to its passage without amendments. All governments routinely introduce legislation for debate without any undertaking that it will be passed by the opposition. Labor favours a stronger model than the Coalition’s proposal. Morrison’s lack of urgency on the issue created tensions within government ranks. Late last year, the Tasmanian Liberal MP Bridget Archer crossed the floor to support independent MP Helen Haines’ bill to establish a federal integrity commission. Archer accused the government of “inertia” over the issue. At that time, Archer said she was “perplexed” at her own government’s failure to release a revised bill almost three years after it was promised before the last election. While Morrison clearly wants to move on from the issue, he will face renewed pressure from crossbench independents if the coming election is close enough to deliver a hung parliament. A number of independents running against Liberals in metropolitan seats have made it clear that establishing a credible national integrity commission will be a key demand in the event any new government – Liberal or Labor – is seeking agreements for confidence and supply. Haines blasted Morrison’s comments on Wednesday. “Mr Morrison broke an election promise to introduce an anti-corruption commission and his pathway to creating one is still as vague as it was in the last parliament,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The crossbench independent said it was “nonsense” for the prime minister to claim that he could not proceed unless Labor agreed with the Coalition’s proposal without seeking any amendments. “It would appear we are in the same void as we were before,” Haines said. Rex Patrick, who is attempting to hold his current South Australian Senate spot, said if voters returned him to parliament he would reintroduce Haines’s bill in the upper house. “The prime minister had three years to move on this yet he never actually introduced his bill into the parliament,” Patrick said. “He always knew it was a political fraud that wouldn’t stand up to scrutiny.” Patrick said Morrison’s comments on Wednesday were “perhaps a rare expression of honesty – he really has no interest in a federal independent commission against corruption and only wants to shift blame on to others for that failure”.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison effectively ditches his promise to establish a federal anti-corruption commission,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/scott-morrison-effectively-ditches-his-promise-to-establish-a-federal-anti-corruption-commission
4/13/2022,"West Ham’s European hopes have suffered a blow after scans revealed that Kurt Zouma’s ankle injury could rule out the defender for the rest of the season. Zouma has not travelled to France for Thursday’s Europa League quarter-final second leg against Lyon and is unlikely to make a swift return. The commanding centre-back was forced off during the first half of West Ham’s 2-0 defeat by Brentford last Sunday and tests have indicated that the France international is facing at least a month on the sidelines. West Ham, who drew 1-1 with Lyon in last Thursday’s first leg, will continue to assess the injury and are holding on to hope that the initial prognosis is overly pessimistic. Zouma has been a key player since his £29.8m move from Chelsea last summer and David Moyes will be desperate to have him back for the run-in, especially as Angelo Ogbonna is out for the season with a knee injury. The prospect of being without his favoured centre-back pairing against Lyon will be a major worry for Moyes. Craig Dawson has not let anyone down since coming in for Ogbonna but there are concerns over Issa Diop’s form. Diop struggled after replacing Zouma in the 29th minute against Brentford and was at fault when Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring. The worry for West Ham, who are sixth in the Premier League and still in with a chance of qualifying for the Champions League, is that they were leaky when Ogbonna and Zouma were out at the same time earlier this season. Dawson and Diop were an unconvincing partnership in central defence. Another complication for Moyes is that West Ham will also be without Aaron Cresswell against Lyon after the influential left-back was controversially sent off during the first leg. Cresswell gives the team balance on the left and his set pieces are a dangerous attacking weapon. Ben Johnson is in line to fill in for the 32-year-old. Moyes could tweak his system to counter Lyon’s threats. A back three is a possibility and there is a chance that Declan Rice could drop back from midfield to bolster West Ham’s defence. Lyon, 10th in Ligue 1, have injury worries over their goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and their key midfielders Tanguy Ndombele and Houssem Aouar. Ndombele, on loan from Spurs, scored Lyon’s equaliser in the first leg",Sport/Football,West Ham fear Kurt Zouma could be out for rest of season with ankle injury,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/west-ham-fear-kurt-zouma-could-be-out-for-rest-of-season-ankle-injury-lyon-europa-league
4/13/2022,"Amid the debate over the war in Ukraine, there’s widespread agreement on one point: the carnage and destruction will continue – not just for weeks, but for months or, according to some western officials, years or even decades. Eventually, however, this war, like all others, will conclude, but not before Russia or Ukraine, perhaps both, become convinced that the losses – in blood and treasure – are unbearable and success beyond reach. Perhaps Vladimir Putin calculates that Ukrainians’ desire to end their suffering will force them to accept peace on his terms and that if they haven’t yet it’s because he hasn’t pounded their towns and cities enough. But the pain could just as well increase Ukrainians’ determination to keep fighting. Countries have endured horrific hardships in wartime. Putin surely understands this. Like all Russians, he learned as a schoolboy about the sacrifices Soviet civilians and soldiers made during “the great patriotic war”. Before the invasion, he may have believed that Ukrainians lacked that sort of mettle. By now he must know that their tenacity has not eroded and that news of widespread Russian atrocities – in Bucha, Trostyanets and elsewhere – has in fact increased it. Although Ukrainians’ morale could dissipate if significant military defeats make it impossible, or futile, for their army to continue fighting, that has not happened yet. Despite the Russian army’s overwhelming superiority in troops and firepower, Ukraine has inflicted substantial losses. Thousands of Russian troops have been killed and numerous tanks and armored vehicles destroyed. Russian commanders have been forced to abandon the northern offensive aimed at Kyiv. Moreover, because continuing western military aid provides Ukraine’s army the means to keep fighting, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy isn’t under pressure to accept a deal that concedes large swathes of Ukraine’s south and east to Russia. And Putin, despite his army’s lackluster performance and the bite of western sanctions, shows no signs of giving up. He seems confident that something that can be packaged and sold as victory remains feasible and that the military setbacks can be overcome. He may be wrong, but don’t count him out just yet. Though we can’t know which side will decide that it cannot continue fighting or when it will reach that conclusion, we are in a better position to anticipate the agenda of a diplomatic endgame and the obstacles to a political settlement. Unless it faces imminent defeat, Ukraine will reject any agreement that does not require Russia to abandon all the territories it has occupied since 24 February. Having endured hell, Ukrainians will denounce as capitulation any deal that does not include that provision unless it is necessary for their country’s survival. The problem is that Putin will insist on terms that enable him to demonstrate to Russians that a war he depicted as essential to safeguarding their country’s security was worth it. Coming home empty-handed will damage his political standing and, barring a turn in the war that’s disastrous for Russia, his calculations won’t change. Then there’s the matter of Ukraine’s postwar status. Before the war, there were proposals for a lengthy moratorium on Ukraine’s membership in Nato, even Ukrainian neutrality. But Russia showed no interest in the former, and Ukraine rejected the latter on various grounds. Nato supported Kyiv’s stance. In the weeks preceding Russia’s invasion, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, stated, repeatedly, that the decision Nato made at its 2008 Bucharest summit to welcome Ukraine was irrevocable. What he didn’t explain was why Ukrainians were kept waiting for nearly 14 years, angering Russia but leaving Ukraine unprotected at the time of its greatest peril. Because both Ukraine and Nato rejected neutrality, we can’t know whether it would have averted Russia’s invasion. Putin had other demands, but they concerned Nato’s eastern front. What he wanted from Ukraine was a binding renunciation of the Atlantic Alliance. Ukrainians have now learned a bitter truth: Nato wasn’t serious about admitting them; its members were too divided to muster the necessary 30-0 vote. Furthermore, rather than having improved Ukraine’s chances for membership, Russia’s invasion may have diminished them. Zelenskiy’s coming to terms with these realities may explain his reconsideration of neutrality. Kyiv has discussed the idea in talks with Moscow but insists that its neutrality must be guaranteed by countries that commit, through a formal agreement, to defend it from attack, including through military intervention. The guarantors mentioned by Ukrainian officials include Nato members: the United States (no surprise there), Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Poland. Their responses have been vague at best. None has declared its willingness to assume the responsibility, and the British have already rejected any pledge resembling Article V of the Nato treaty. Yet having been invaded by Russia, Kyiv won’t embrace neutrality unless it includes an ironclad insurance policy. A political settlement also depends on Nato’s objectives. Will the alliance specify the conditions Russia must fulfill before sanctions can be lifted and agree to lift them, even if in stages, once Moscow delivers? Or will it refuse to clarify terms and timelines? Does Nato seek Russia’s withdrawal from Ukrainian territories occupied after 24 February or to maintain the sanctions indefinitely in order to diminish Russia’s power, and perhaps even precipitate “regime change”? Short of outright military defeat, which is hard to imagine, Russia won’t give something in exchange for nothing. Nato seems divided on these questions. Some members, most likely Poland and the Baltic states, want Ukraine to resist compromises because it is fighting for Europe’s security, not merely its own. But if Nato seizes the war as an opportunity to deliver body blows to Russia it will surely prolong it and increase the number of Ukrainian deaths. Plus, the longer the war continues, the greater the risk that it could spread beyond Ukraine and lead to a clash between Nato and Russia – one in which nuclear weapons could be used. It is within Putin’s power to wind down this war, but what Nato does matters as well.

4/13/2022,"Operation Mincemeat was the bizarre real-life scheme cooked up by British intelligence in 1943 to fool Nazi Germany into thinking the allies planned to invade Greece and Sardinia, rather than their actual target, Sicily. The corpse of a tramp was dressed up as fictitious “Capt William Martin” and carried elaborate bogus plans for this nonexistent invasion; the body was dumped into the sea so that it would wash up in Spain where the British were confident this phoney intelligence would be obediently passed to the Germans. Screenwriter Michelle Ashford has adapted the nonfiction bestseller by Ben Macintyre about this extraordinary adventure and John Madden directs, with Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen playing the stiff upper lipped chaps in charge, Ewen Montagu and Charles Cholmondeley. And Johnny Flynn plays naval intelligence’s brightest spark: Lt Cdr Ian Fleming (the future creator of James Bond, who possibly had the idea in the first place) in an entertainingly tongue-in-cheek performance. In many ways, the most important figure here is the MI5 clerk Jean Leslie (played by Kelly Macdonald) whose photo was placed on the body to be the fake captain’s imagined “girlfriend”. Leslie’s supporting role is part of the way this film is striving for a rather modern emotional intelligence: it is less callous and more caring about the wretched homeless man being used in this way, and the leading players are pondering, like artists, their creation and the light he casts on their own stress and loneliness. It is a bit different from the previous film about Operation Mincemeat, The Man Who Never Was (1956), which was adapted directly from Montagu’s own published memoir, and created a human-interest angle with an entirely fictional and slightly noir-ish subplot about a pro-German Irish spy who investigates the phoney girlfriend, played by Gloria Grahame. Did the real Operation Mincemeat do any good? This film doesn’t commit itself, but hints at all sorts of spycraft double-bluff which may finally have done the job. This is another of the “home front wartime” Britfilms, such as Munich: The Edge of War, Their Finest, The Imitation Game and Darkest Hour, all probably inspired by the Oscar-winning success of The King’s Speech, which have their emphasis on domestic morale, strategic ingenuity and political shenanigans, rather than battlefield action. Operation Mincemeat is watchable enough, but perhaps can’t find a fictional way into the stranger-than-fiction outrageousness of the scheme itself.

4/13/2022,"The English may be suspicious of foreigners but we sometimes need them to explain us to ourselves. Detlev Piltz, a German lawyer, became an anglophile as a 16-year-old schoolboy when he spent a month in the home of a Cotswold vicar, whose infant daughter Theresa would grow up to become prime minister. The English, he thinks, are a “wondrously wacky people”. And what especially fascinates him is our class system, the nuances of which he has been studying for half a century. He thinks it’s the elephant in our room, something we don’t talk about, or which we pretend doesn’t exist. For a politician to admit to having a privileged background is “political suicide”; even Labour, once the party of the proletariat, finds class an uncomfortable subject. MPs may talk of levelled up, one-nation togetherness but they know it’s unattainable. “Class is the enemy of equality,” Piltz says, but that’s no reason to knock it. To his mind, England isn’t class-ridden but class-enriched. For 200 pages he lays out his case, broadly distinguishing between the “hard” markers of class (education, occupation and income) and the “soft” (everything from clothes and furnishings to cars, holidays, sport and shopping bags). But it’s in the middle section of the book that the fun begins, as he updates Nancy Mitford, Jilly Cooper and The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook with exhaustive lists of the things that denote our place in the pecking order. Piltz’s lists are provocative. Intentionally so, perhaps: if he isn’t invited on to chatshows to defend his findings, I’ll throw away my brown shoes, which I shouldn’t be wearing anyway (“In London shoes are only black … Brown shoes are best kept for tramping the hills”). Many of his markers look well past their sell-by: does anyone still say “spiffing” and “dash it”? And does Piltz seriously believe that the “majority of English citizens” look up to hereditary peers? His book has little sense of how race, gender and social media have changed the rules. He does try to be even-handed but his prejudices invariably show through. On upper/lower differences when it comes to clothes, for example, it’s “look stylish” versus “look like a fashion victim”; with conversation, “dialogue/monologue”; and with vacations, an “activity holiday” as opposed to “binge-drinking and getting sunburned”. Discretion is always preferred. “Sartorial perfection and overgrooming are the trappings of a spiv,” we’re told, which also holds true for gardens: it doesn’t do to be neat and tidy. Once the fun with lists is over, Piltz returns to his defence of the status quo. Hierarchies are inevitable. Meritocracy doesn’t work: when everyone has the same chance, the losers have only themselves to blame – or as the exiled Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky puts it: “If a man is not an oligarch, something is not right with him.” Fat-cat salaries shouldn’t be resented since CEOs are “vital for society as a whole”. At 400-plus pages, Piltz is nothing if not thorough. He includes some great quotes and such gems as the 2015 Country Life list of the 39 attributes that make a gentleman (they include “turns his mobile to silent at dinner” and “can sail a boat and ride a horse”). How sweet that a German lawyer should find us so charming! It’s just a pity he’s so in thrall to our upper echelons. And that he welcomes Brexit as an expression of English patriotism and courage. To which the average reader of the Guardian (a newspaper he’s not too keen on) may be tempted to say: “Bullshit!” – or, as a proper gentleman would put it: “Pish tosh!” England: A Class of Its Own – An Outsider’s View by Detlev Piltz is published by Bloomsbury (£20).

4/13/2022,"There’s a lot more to Simon “Will from The Inbetweeners” Bird than meets the eye. As he’s said himself, he’ll probably never quite get away from his role at the posh one with the briefcase in three Channel 4 series and two films of Iain Morris and Damon Beesley’s teenage-angst-ridden sitcom. Although he had a damn good try as slightly less annoying son, Adam, in six series of Channel 4’s gone, but not forgotten, Friday Night Dinner. Bird made his West End debut in 2017’s The Philanthropist with Charlotte “Ghosts” Ritchie, Lily Cole, Tom Rosenthal and Matt “Toast of London” Berry. In a three-star review, the Guardian’s Michael Billington described Bird’s performance as: “Funny rather than sad. Previous inhabitants of the role, including Alec McCowen and Simon Russell Beale, have made me think of Chekhov. Bird, sitting with knees locked firmly together and a compulsive grin on his face, evokes memories of Mr Bean.” Bird’s first outing as a director came in 2020 with coming-of-age comedy drama Days of the Bagnold Summer, written by Bird’s wife, Lisa Owens, based on the 2012 Joff Winterhart graphic novel and starring Earl “Son of Nick” Cave, Monica “W1A” Dolan, Rob “Uncle Bryn” Brydon, Tamsin “Episodes” Greig, and Tim “Sidekick Simon” Key, with a score by Belle and Sebastian. In a four-star review, the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described the film as “charming” and “gently satisfying”, which is saying something considering Bradshaw’s middle name is “not easily impressed”. Now Days of the Bagnold Summer is getting a physical release for the first time (remember those?) – chock full of exclusive Winterhart artwork, interviews, video essays and, of course (unless the disc has fallen out), the film itself.

4/13/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden has accused Russia of carrying out genocide in Ukraine, saying that Vladimir Putin is “trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian”. Biden has been consistently outspoken in denouncing Russia’s wholesale killing of Ukrainian civilians, labelling Putin a “war criminal” in mid-March. Multiple investigations are under way into Russian atrocities in Ukraine, which include the razing of Mariupol and the executions of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. The prosecutor at the international criminal court in The Hague opened a case in February saying there was “a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine”. Proving a case under the 1948 Genocide Convention requires an “intent [by the accused] to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. What did Biden say? “More evidence is coming out of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we’re going to only learn more and more about the devastation. We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.” What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 49 of the invasion. A gunman wearing a gas mask filled a crowded New York subway car with thick black smoke from a canister and opened fire on morning rush-hour passengers, injuring more than 20, including 10 with gunshot wounds. A hunt was under way yesterday after the shooter fled the scene. A 9mm semi-automatic handgun and extended magazines, a hatchet, a black garbage can, detonated and undetonated smoke grenades and a key to a U-Haul van were also found at the scene, authorities said. Officers located the vehicle, which will be examined by a bomb squad. Injured passengers sustained bullet wounds, smoke inhalation and the physical effects of panic. Nobody was reported to be in life-threatening condition. Biden said on Tuesday afternoon: “We’re not letting up until we find the perpetrator.” He thanked professional first responders and civilians who rushed to help their fellow travelers amid the panic. Do we know anything about the suspect? As of late Tuesday night, officials had no one in police custody, but authorities named Frank James, 62, as a person of interest in connection to the shooting. A $50,000 reward has been offered for information. An “insidious and coordinated” effort between lawmakers and extremist groups is under way to undermine American democracy, according to a new report. On Tuesday, the nonpartisan civil rights organization National Urban League released the annual report in its analysis series The State of Black America. The report, called Under Siege: The Plot to Destroy Democracy, outlines the “conspiracy and the urgent case for a national mobilization to protect and defend our most sacred constitutional right”. It focuses on four main tactics that it says are used in this effort: gerrymandering, voter suppression, misinformation and intimidation. In 2021 alone, 20 states everaged census data to redraw congressional maps, it noted. The new maps proposed by Republican state lawmakers “are no more than modern-day gerrymandering that strips voting power away from communities with Black and brown voters”, the report said. What else does the report say? “The burden of these laws – strict photo ID requirements, the elimination or restriction of Sunday voting, voting by mail and early voting, and the closing of polling locations – overwhelmingly falls on Black voters,” Marc Morial, the president and chief executive of NUL, said in the report. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, have been given fixed-penalty notices for contravening their own Covid law, becoming the first sitting prime minister and chancellor to face sanctions for breaking the law. Johnson has rejected furious calls to quit. A former Xinjiang detainee has arrived in the US to testify over repeated torture he says he was subjected to in one of China’s mass detention camps. Ovalbek Turdakun was given special authorization to enter the US after he alleged he had been imprisoned without a fair trial and tortured repeatedly. A Twitter shareholder is suing Elon Musk for failing to disclose that he had bought a substantial stake in the company, affecting share prices. The Tesla chief executive acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter but it took several weeks for him to reveal this, violating federal law requiring disclosure within 10 days. Sherri Papini, the northern California woman charged last month with faking her kidnapping in 2016, admitted she had made up the story that prompted a frantic search and international headlines. She accepted a plea bargain with prosecutors yesterday and said she was “deeply ashamed”. Warhol’s portrait of Marilyn Monroe, probably his most recognised work, will go on auction at Christie’s in New York in May. If Christie’s has got its estimate right, it will sell for about $200m (£150m). That will make it the most expensive 20th-century work of art ever auctioned. The current record is held by Picasso, so Andy will be established as bigger than Pablo and therefore the greatest artist of the modern age – at least according to an equation of artistic and monetary value he himself invented. A shocking new docu-series thrusts the highly unregulated and dangerous world of cosmetics into the spotlight. Not So Pretty, a new HBO Max documentary series from the investigative film-makers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, looks at toxic chemicals in the beauty industry and the lax regulation, lack of oversight and corporate lobbying that allows for routine US consumer exposure to dangerous substances. Sixteen young people are suing the state of Montana for failing to protect their generation from irreversible harm brought by the climate crisis in what will be the first youth-led climate case to make it to trial. Their case, Held v State of Montana, argues that state lawmakers have prioritized the business interests of the fossil fuel industry over their future. Experts say a decision in favor of the 16 youth plaintiffs could have sweeping implications across the US. In terms of elusiveness, it is the Bigfoot or Loch Ness monster of the bird world, so rare and undetectable that the US government declared it extinct last year. But the ivory-bill woodpecker is, in fact, still alive and pecking in the forests of Louisiana, a team of researchers has claimed. A series of grainy pictures and observations of the bird, which had its last widely accepted sighting in 1944, show that the furtive woodpecker is still holding on in the swampy forests of the US south.

He’s got a slightly awkward charm, like a nerd trapped inside the body of the first XI captain; he’s absolutely determined that the audience has a good time, to the extent of asking them to stand up for Blame It on Me (he’d had them standing for Paradise, but he took too long between songs and everyone sat down), and he’s got hooks so plentiful he could go long-line fishing with them. These are songs that have been laboured over. Hooks as indelible as Cassy O’s don’t get written by accident, and you can hear the cleverness in the way the chords under the chorus shuffle their order rather than directly repeating: hooks under hooks. He’s spoken often about his mental health, and it rises up in his lyrics – in the lecture he gets from a friend in Pretty Shining People about being afraid to embrace the world; the references to anxiety in Get Away – but these aren’t just sad lyrics in cheerful music. They’re sad lyrics in music designed to feel like sunshine. This is so much the case that being at the gig rather feels like listening to a succession of holiday ad soundtracks. During Blame It on Me, when the brass section are invited off their platform to cavort awkwardly around the stage to a Latin breakdown – pop’s internationally recognised symbol for “Let’s party!” – it even looks like a holiday ad. The songs – inspired by trips abroad – are filled with travel, and you rather wonder if he and his co-writer, Joel Pott, simply realised that people like being reminded of their hols, and set out to recreate that feeling again and again. They’re not afraid to remind you of other songs: Green Green Grass, from his forthcoming third album, has a chorus a stone’s throw from Quinn the Eskimo; the chorus of Paradise, with its burbling bass, scratching guitar and references to “hot sun” sounds like a Graceland outtake. This is all ruthlessly professional songwriting, but that’s pop: ruthless professionalism delivers hits, and there’s no sign of them stopping for Ezra.

4/13/2022,"A senior US military general has warned during a visit to Australia that China’s offer to deepen security ties with Solomon Islands will come with strings attached, suggesting the Pacific island country may come to regret the planned deal. “My parents told me if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” the commandant of the United States Marine Corps, general David Berger, said on Wednesday. Berger was cautious when asked about longstanding US concerns relating to a Chinese company’s lease over the port of Darwin, stressing it was a sovereign decision for Australia as part of its yet-to-be-completed national security review. Ahead of a trip to Darwin, the site of increasing rotations of US Marines, Berger said: “If it’s not of concern to Australia, then it’s not of concern to me.” Berger’s visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity by the US and Australia attempting to head off a proposed security agreement between China and Solomon Islands, which could allow regular visits by the People’s Liberation Army Navy. A leaked draft from last month raised the possibility China could “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”, while Chinese forces could also be used “to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. The prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, has sought to allay concerns, saying his country has no intention of allowing a Chinese naval base. But Sogavare has also said it is “very insulting to be branded as unfit to manage our sovereign affairs”. Speaking in Canberra on Wednesday, Berger said the US needed to show humility in its outreach to Pacific nations, but also needed to be open about the potential long-term consequences. Berger reflected on the fight for control of Guadalcanal in Solomon Islands during the second world war, when the US and allies sought to prevent Japanese forces from gaining a foothold in the strategically important location. “A lot of things change in warfare. Not geography. Where … Solomon Islands are matters. It did then and it does now,” Berger said at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. He said the proposed agreement was “just another example” of China seeking to broaden and expand its influence. He raised concerns about “the way that [it] happens and the consequences for the nations” involved. Sogavare has argued Solomon Islands pursues a “friends to all and enemies to none” foreign policy, but Berger implied countries making agreements with Beijing might regret it down the track. “We should illuminate, we should draw out into the open what this means long term,” Berger said. “This is, in other words, an extension of ‘hey we’re here with a cheque, we’re here with money, we’d like to improve your port or your airfield or your bus station’. And that just sounds so great, until a year later or six months later.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The US plans to reopen its embassy in Solomon Islands, a move the nominee for US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, has said “can’t come soon enough”. Berger acknowledged there were limits to US insights in Pacific island countries, so the US needed to rely on allies such as Australia. “We’re not going to have always the best view, the clearest picture,” he said. “We have to understand the neighbourhood and we’re never going to understand it as well as Australia.” Earlier, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, denied that the US had conveyed any concerns that Australia had dropped the ball in the region. Morrison said the Australian government was continuing to raise concerns with Solomon Islands without acting in a “heavy-handed” way. Australia’s minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja, met with Sogavare in Honiara on Wednesday and “asked Solomon Islands respectfully to consider not signing the agreement” with China. Seselja suggested Solomon Islands “consult the Pacific family in the spirit of regional openness and transparency”. Australia would work with Solomon Islands “swiftly, transparently and with full respect for its sovereignty”. “We welcome recent statements from prime minister Sogavare that Australia remains Solomon Islands’ security partner of choice, and his commitment that Solomon Islands will never be used for military bases or other military institutions of foreign powers,” Seselja said. Sogavare has previously said Solomon Islands welcomed “any country that is willing to support us in our security space”. But Matthew Wale, the leader of the opposition, has argued the deal “would make the Solomons a geopolitical playing field” and “further threaten the nation’s fragile unity”.",News/World news,US military leader warns Chinese security deal with Solomon Islands sounds ‘too good to be true’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/us-military-leader-warns-chinese-security-deal-with-solomon-islands-sounds-too-good-to-be-true
4/13/2022,"Ten months into football club ownership and the question that comes up with most frequency is: “Are you enjoying it?” Normally this would be a straightforward question to answer and yet it struck me as surprisingly difficult until I had the time to think properly about it. Football is both of and for our communities, holds up a mirror to our society and gives us a unique window into human behaviour and psychology. On occasion it offers a powerful metaphor for the things in life worth striving for and an opportunity to be part of what Jon Yates, in his book Fractured, calls the “common life”: moments of shared experience that are not dependent on class, education, race or any other variable but become the moments that allow us to see beyond the boundaries and prejudices that our politics are often reinforcing. Football has the ability to remind us of our collective power and the sense of community. But when I am asked whether I am enjoying the experience of football ownership, the short answer is “no”, in part because of the lack of rationality in the game. It’s not enjoyable on a day-to-day basis but neither should it be. In the same way that some people have an obsession with “happiness” or “success” as a goal in life, consistent enjoyment is unattainable and undesirable as a permanent state. As Victor Frankl stated in his seminal work, Man’s Search For Meaning: “Don’t aim at success – the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue.” The last 10 months have been a massive opportunity to learn, to connect, to be challenged and to be part of a community’s story that is bigger than our own. The moments of joy are rare, but intense. Jordan Maguire Drew’s last-minute equaliser against Halifax, John McAtee’s absolute peach of a volley against Altrincham, Gavan Holohan’s perfect first goal for the club versus Chesterfield. The intensity and frequency of these emotions often hijack our rationality and undermine our long-term thinking, the parts of our brain that are underdeveloped compared with our emotional, intuitive brains. In this way, the game offers an important way to think about the biases, our search for certainty and the place for our emotions in decision-making. We know much more about decision-making from recent advances in evolutionary biology and modern psychology. I really like the analogy by Jonathan Haidt, who stated that our rational mind is like a rider on the back of an elephant, where the elephant represents our emotions and intuitions and the rider represents our rational thought. When you lose 1-0 at home, that runaway elephant insists we sack the manager, while the rider tries to hold on and whispers in the elephant’s ear that we worked hard, played well and there’s always next week. At Grimsby we had the best start to the season since 1982 and then, from late October, we went 10 games with only one win in the National League. “Attribution bias” is falsely crediting capabilities retrospectively to actions. It assumes that when you are winning you are skilful and capable but as soon as you start losing you suddenly become a failure and you are talentless. The attribution of talent and then its inverse in such a short space of time clearly makes no sense, particularly for people who have years of experience in the game. When we looked at the differences in performances between the blocks there was not a lot of difference in work rate and goal chances. We lost most games by a single goal and failed to score. Whether we choose to admit it or not, luck and chance play a more significant role in our lives and we often underestimate their impact. Yet, in the space of 90 minutes of play it should be clear to anyone who has ever watched a game that there are multiple possible worlds that play out differently if a player is not injured, if a decision goes a different way or if a goal goes in rather than a ball hit the post. It is a constant reminder of the fragility of reality that small changes in variables can affect massive differences in outcome. Alongside the acknowledgment of the multiplicity of life we need more empathy and perspective. I normally sit high in our largest stand and watch the game from a vantage point where you can see the whole game’s mathematical possibilities – all of the spaces and options available at all times to all players. The following week I was on the opposite side of our ground, five rows back, almost pitch level, experiencing the game close to as a manager would see it. The difference was staggering. Closer to the action there was a much more singular view of the play and I felt much more empathy for the players and staff because your perspective dictates the amount of actual space you can see rather than possible options. We hardly ever think of what the manager, player or – dare I say it – referee is actually seeing rather than all of the options we can see in a stadium or on TV. Perspective is everything and yet we hardly ever consider that. In football and in life, when emotions are high it’s hard to detach from our passion and engage rationally. It’s even harder to have empathy for those actually in the game observed from high in the stands. Ten months in and it seems clear that if we want to build something that will last then ownership requires a more rational element to match the emotion that the game generates. I also believe we need to think about our individual perspective and have more empathy for those around us. If we can do that, maybe we could all enjoy the game a bit more.

4/13/2022,"Nurses are being flown in from interstate to ease staffing shortages at a far western New South Wales aged care facility where four residents have died with Covid over the past fortnight. The fourth death at St Anne’s in Broken Hill was confirmed on Wednesday after the outbreak first hit the facility in late March, with 30 people so far testing positive. The chief executive of Southern Cross Care Broken Hill, Zoe Tonkin, said two of the residents who died after testing positive were believed to be recovering and had returned negative tests before their deaths. She said the facility was now bracing for the “worst-case scenario” after a case in the Alzheimer’s unit was confirmed on Tuesday. “We knew if it got in there it would whip through like a wildfire … that’s what’s happened in other aged care facilities,” Tonkin told Guardian Australia. “We feared that if Covid was to get into this facility, in particular, that would be extremely hard to maintain. Our facility has shared bathrooms, bedrooms.” Positive patients were being moved into an isolation wing and visitation had been limited to residents in palliative care. The outbreak at St Anne’s, as well as throughout the broader community, had placed extra pressure on staff. “We’ve had lots of support from our staff – I will never be able to repay them for their work,” Tonkin said. Ten nurses from across the country are being sent to the centre to make up for those isolating or furloughed. The secretary of the Health Services Union NSW, Gerard Hayes, said the situation at St Anne’s was representative of what was happening across the state as aged care facilities struggle to find and keep staff as cases surge. “There’s not enough staff in the system on a good day,” he said, calling on the federal government to take swifter action. “It’s a perfect storm in relation to a great need and very little supply.” He said the pandemic had “demoralised” workers and pushed them to their limits. “It’s put them through physical and psychological stress that most workers should never have to deal with,” Hayes said. Of the more than 25,400 aged care residents who have tested positive to Covid so far during the pandemic, 10,443 have been in NSW – the most of any state. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to the most recently available federal government data, 643 aged care residents have died from Covid in NSW since January 2020. The deaths at St Anne’s would shock the community, the deputy mayor of Broken Hill, Jim Hickey, said. “This is really upsetting for our community because we’re quite an ageing population here,” he said. “It’s a tight-knit community and we all know each other, so it would affect a lot of people. Four deaths would affect a lot of people in Broken Hill, for sure.” Until this year, Broken Hill had largely been spared major Covid outbreaks but the return of tourists after Sydney restrictions were lifted before Christmas has seen cases surge. More than 550 people have tested positive in the Far West local health district over the past week. “Although that’s great for our economy, it’s probably not great for our health service and if the health service becomes inundated here, where we’re fairly isolated, it could become a very big problem depending on how bad it gets,” Hickey said. “It’s quite scary.”",News/Australia news,Broken Hill nursing home bracing for ‘worst-case scenario’ after four residents die from Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/broken-hill-nursing-home-bracing-for-worst-case-scenario-after-four-residents-die-from-covid
