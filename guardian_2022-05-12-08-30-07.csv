5/12/2022,"Pep Guardiola said Kevin De Bruyne is reaping the rewards of adding a selfish streak to his game after his four-goal haul propelled Manchester City to within touching distance of a fourth Premier League title in five seasons. Guardiola’s side destroyed Wolves 5-1 to restore their three-point advantage over Liverpool with two games to play and the City manager admitted that the marquee signing of Erling Haaland will only help them to increase their goals tally. Raheem Sterling registered City’s fifth six minutes from time and De Bruyne hit the post with a minute to spare. “I’m so disappointed with him because he missed a fifth goal, with [hitting] the post,” Guardiola said, smiling. “I know he is always a guy who is so generous and always has the sense to make an assist but this season I think he has the sense to be prolific and score goals. “He won the game against Chelsea [in January], he scored against [Real] Madrid and he has been decisive scoring goals and at the end this makes the greatest [players]. I’m very pleased for him because of course scoring four goals in the decisive part of the league is so important. “We’ve spoken during the years – ‘You have to arrive to the box, you have to be close to the box and you have to score.’ This season I think was the year that he has done better and better. Hopefully he can continue not just this year but for the rest of his career. “I have the feeling that now he is starting to enjoy goals. Before it was just assists and now I have the feeling it is: ‘I like it when my teammates come to hug me because I scored a goal.’ I think it is good.” De Bruyne scored a 17-minute first‑half hat-trick and added his fourth on the hour. Phil Foden also hit the woodwork late on. The only sour note for City was further defensive injuries, with Rúben Dias, John Stones and Kyle Walker already out for the rest of the season. Guardiola confirmed that both the 37-year-old Fernandinho, who started at centre-back, and Aymeric Laporte, who was replaced by Nathan Aké because of a knee problem, are doubts for the trip to West Ham on Sunday. “We have incredible problems in behind and against [Michail] Antonio, [Jarrod] Bowen and [Manuel] Lanzini and all their mates it will not be easy,” the City manager said. “At the same time it doesn’t matter what happens, we are going to find a solution and of course we’re obviously going there to win the game.” Guardiola said he has been delighted with his side’s emphatic response since they exited the Champions League against Real Madrid. “You always doubt about how they [will] react but we have done it the way we have the last month for five years. We have done it many, many times. My players didn’t change one second and the results are not going to change my opinion about that. The people say it is a tragedy or a big success, but I don’t play this game.” Jürgen Klopp described Haaland, a £51m signing from Borussia Dortmund, as a “beast” and Guardiola said he is looking forward to helping the Norway forward, whose father, Alf-Inge, played for City, to settle in Manchester. “Big congratulations to the club, he is signed for the next years, he is a young talented player, I’m very pleased he decided to come and join us,” Guardiola said. “Next season we are going to work together and hopefully he can settle – help him to settle as soon as possible in terms of Manchester and a house. I am pretty sure he is going to adapt quickly to the way we want to play. It is a decision for the club to make a good sign for the future.” Carlos Cachada – the Wolves first‑team fitness coach who led the players from the sidelines in the absence of the head coach, Bruno Lage, who has coronavirus – conceded the best team won. “I think it was a fair result,” he said. The Portuguese wing-back Chiquinho, who made his first start, said: “It was a very difficult game. We tried everything, but they are a strong team and they’ve proven on the pitch that they are better than us.”",Sport/Football,"Kevin De Bruyne reaping rewards of selfish streak, says Pep Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/kevin-de-bruyne-reaping-rewards-of-selfish-streak-says-pep-guardiola
5/12/2022,"Sadiq Khan has announced a commission to examine the effectiveness of the UK’s drug laws, with a particular focus on those governing cannabis. The London drugs commission, to be chaired by Lord Charlie Falconer QC, a former lord chancellor and justice secretary, was one of Khan’s manifesto pledges in his re-election bid last year. The mayor of London’s office said a panel of independent experts in criminal justice, public health, politics, community relations and academia will be assembled to consider evidence from around the world on the outcomes of various drug policies. Khan is now on a four-day visit to the US to promote investment in London to support its recovery from the pandemic. The trip has also included a fact-finding mission to Los Angeles to see the impact of the city’s decision to legalise cannabis in 2016. Khan has visited a cannabis dispensary and cultivation facility, met licensed retailers and growers, and spoken with officials from the Los Angeles Police Department and the city’s local government. California legalised the recreational use of cannabis after a public ballot that passed with the approval of 57% of voters, although individual counties and cities can still choose to ban its sale. Supporters said the move would create a market for safe and regulated cannabis while reducing the power of criminal gangs. The law change led to a fall in cannabis-related arrests – from 13,810 in 2016 to 6,065 in 2017 – but critics have pointed out that the illicit market continues to thrive, with up to 90% of all sales still coming from unlicensed sellers. London’s commission will aim to assess the best methods to prevent drug use, the most effective criminal justice responses, and the public health benefits of different approaches. University College London has been appointed to provide research and analysis on the implications of any potential change in policy. The commission will not consider class A drugs. Once it has completed its work, it will make policy recommendations for City Hall, the government, the police, the criminal justice system and public health services. Announcing the commission, Khan said he believed it would help “tackle drug-related crime, protect Londoners’ health and reduce the huge damage that illegal drugs cause to our communities”. He added: “The illegal drugs trade causes huge damage to our society and we need to do more to tackle this epidemic and further the debate around our drugs laws. “That’s why I am here today in LA, to see first-hand the approach they have taken to cannabis.” Falconer said: “I’m honoured to have been appointed chair of the London drugs commission. We need rigorously to identify what is the best approach to reduce harm to our communities. “A national debate is long overdue. We aim to make recommendations to bring about effective and lasting change.” The Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, said that decriminalisation of cannabis offered “historically marginalised communities opportunities for healing, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation” in a growing industry. “Cities have so much to learn from one another, and I applaud mayor Khan’s thoughtful approach as London moves forward,” he said.",News/Society,Sadiq Khan launches commission to examine cannabis legality,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/sadiq-khan-launches-commission-to-examine-cannabis-legality
5/12/2022,"We are instructed to meet at a secret Brighton location for this site-specific show by the company dreamthinkspeak. For some of us that invites the usual anxieties: when will we be told of our meeting place? (Four hours beforehand when the e-ticket arrives, in my case.) What is the show about? Why are we asked to register on a website called ARK-22? The whys and what-fors are not immediately answered when we receive an induction into the night’s events, which are inspired by Dostoevsky’s novel The Possessed and are created and directed by Tristan Sharps. We will be travelling in small groups called “cells”, and will receive instructions via little laptops that we wear around our necks. My fellow cell members are Brightonites who have taken part in dreamthinkspeak shows before and tell me it is, in their experience, a “leap into the unknown”. They are right, though there seems to be more guidance than usual because our laptops on this night are glitchy. We do receive some messages from a character called Cyrus (Azaan Symes) who we follow around town. We are told of a family tragedy that led to Cyrus’s initiation into an underground social justice movement called ARK-22 (aha!). It is, he says, an activist group aiming to overturn parliamentary democracy, which he brands elite and self-interested, and to install “direct democracy” instead. Cyrus’s arguments around social inequality are idealistic but compelling, and we find ourselves following him through the city to a meeting house, a pub and into Brighton’s historical centre including the museum and pavilion. We encounter other activists from ARK-22, collect parcels and witness a hostage situation. Sometimes it seems as if we are just traipsing, though the route shows poverty and homelessness in the city as well as Brighton’s heritage and wealth, which we are reminded was built on slavery. Along the way we hear other personal and intensely told stories from activists and these moments are full of drama – more dramatic than the action itself. We also hear the persuasive words of a police officer (Antonia Draper) who informs us of ARK-22’s violence. We must decide whether to be snitches or to side with the actions of ARK-22 in our silence. The experience demands complicity or compliance. In our group we discuss not only direct democracy and the ethics of violent activism but also our jobs and – ironically – house prices in Brighton. There is a final, riveting debate between the leader of ARK-22 and a rich governess (Rachel Heaton). My sympathies for ARK-22 waver when the value of the people’s vote is discussed and the shadow of the European referendum hovers, unspoken. How easily can direct democracy be manipulated or corrupted? But the show’s greater theme of systemic inequality and political abuses of power could not be more relevant now amid poverty in Britain and the aftermath of Partygate. If the action feels weak at times, the issues are potent and linger in the mind. And as much as it is a voyage into the unknown, it returns us to the ills of our society, and those at its margins.

5/12/2022,"People working in entertainment and performing arts are twice as likely to experience depression as the general population, according to a review of more than 100 academic studies. The impact of Covid restrictions on theatres and other venues in 2020 and 2021 had exacerbated contributory factors such as job insecurity and low pay, said the actors’ union, Equity, which commissioned the review. Antisocial working hours, time away from home and lack of support from people in positions of authority also fuelled anxiety and depression. The review, carried out by Dr Lucie Clements, examined 111 academic studies relating to mental health in professionals and students in the performing arts sector over the past 20 years. Two studies, one focusing on actors and another on ballet dancers, showed depression to be twice as likely in performers than in the general population. Other papers found that 24% of ballet dancers reported experiencing anxiety, along with 32% of opera singers, 52% of acting students, 60% of actors and 90% of rock musicians. Among the general population, 6% of individuals are thought to experience anxiety in any given week. More than seven out of 10 workers in the sector are freelance, with irregular hours of employment, coupled with an expectation to be flexible and available when work does arise, according to the review. Antisocial working hours and late-night performances may lead to disruption to sleep or inconsistent sleep routines – a known risk factor for mental health problems. “The inconsistency of touring and pressures of time travelling, erratic working schedules (including evenings and weekend performance) and chunks of time working away mean a lack of time for loved ones, family or social life,” says the review. “Musicians, for example, spoke of going months without seeing their children. This is important since support from loved ones is known to be one of the most significant protective factors for mental health.” According to one study, 83% of actors said financial stress was an issue at least “sometimes”, with 30% experiencing financial stress as a constant issue. Many performers juggle multiple jobs to make ends meet. As well as employment-related issues, the review found that the impact of portraying intense emotions and repeatedly depicting extreme situations such as death or rape can contribute to poor mental health. Worries about how an individual’s performance would be received by others was also a contributory factor. Another was pressure to conform to aesthetic ideals, “such as for female actors and dancers to be slender …. Weight pressures and eating disorder risk were directly related to both depression and anxiety in dancers … [and] anxiety, depression, and stress were all correlated with disordered eating in musicians, including vocalists.” Paul Fleming, Equity’s general secretary, said: “This landmark study confirms in concrete terms what Equity members have known for years: those working in the entertainment and performing arts industries are likely to experience poor mental health. There are a range of contributing factors, but it’s abundantly clear that the harmful impacts of precarious work, low pay and poor working conditions are fuelling this collective crisis.” In response to the review’s findings, Equity has launched a mental health charter with five key demands aimed at improving mental health and wellbeing among performers. They include improving pay and work-life balance, adopting safeguards and risk assessments in the workplace and ensuring historically marginalised groups are not excluded from good practice. Equity also calls on the government to invest in mental health services to reverse a decade of underfunding.",News/Society,"People in performing arts twice as likely to have depression, Equity finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/performing-arts-depression-equity-covid-job-insecurity
5/12/2022,"British universities are producing a greater depth of world-leading research than previously realised, the results of a large exercise examining the output and real-world impact of 76,000 academics in the UK suggests. The findings of the research excellence framework (REF), looking at work produced from 2014–2021, is based on rating nearly 186,000 pieces of academic research, with the results used to divide up about £2bn in annual government funding. According to experts, the results show that Oxford and University College London are likely to get the largest share of government research grants based on the high proportion of their departments rated as “world leading”. But the overall results showed a small decline in the proportion of top-class research by the “golden triangle” of Cambridge, Oxford and London universities, and showed larger pockets of high-quality research at smaller institutions. The University of Northumbria was one of the biggest winners, with its research output in areas allied to health, such as nursing and engineering, receiving high proportions of top ratings. Andrew Wathey, Northumbria’s vice-chancellor, said his university’s increase from 52nd to 28th in market share of future funding “moves us clearly into territory formerly the preserve of the Russell Group” of universities as a global force in research. “Northumbria is the first modern university to cross the clear blue water that separated the old and the new parts of the sector, and others are following,” Wathey said. The two-year-long peer review found that 41% of research submitted was worthy of a “world leading” rating of four stars, while 43% received three stars as “internationally excellent”. The 2014 REF rated 22% of research as world leading but senior leaders said the increase was the result of improved submissions and changes in how the exercise was run. Reforms since 2014 forced universities to include all academic staff with significant research involvement in their submissions. But it also them gave greater flexibility in how many pieces of research could be submitted for each member, including for staff whose careers had been disrupted during the period. For the 2014 REF, about 52,000 academics submitted 190,000 pieces of work, while in 2021 76,000 staff submitted 185,600 pieces of research, including books and journal papers. David Sweeney, the executive chair of Research England, said the reforms had made it impossible to compare the results. “I think we are seeing that research in the UK continues to be very, very strong, and perhaps a little bit stronger. But this is about a different measure,” he said. Prof Dinah Birch, who chaired the REF’s arts and humanities review panel, said the differences were far-reaching. “This is a different exercise and lining up the REF 2021 results against those of 2014 will be misleading,” she said. Birch said a “dizzying variety” of research was submitted. “Everything from the fiction of Anthony Trollope, to the nature of the particles that make up the substance of the universe, to the identification of new materials for manufacturing innovation,” she said. Rankings calculated by Research Professional News, a specialist publication that tracks funding, found that Oxford’s “market share” of funding was likely to fall from 6.24% in 2014, after the previous REF, to 5.7%. The rankings also showed that Lancaster and Loughborough universities had better results than two members of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities, with Lancaster above Queen’s University Belfast and the London School of Economics. Sarah Richardson, editor of Research Professional News, said the REF outcomes were crucial in giving universities access to longer-term, more flexible streams of “quality-related” funding. “It’s crucial for universities and researchers because it pays for their ongoing costs, like salaries and early-stage seed funding for projects, and it helps them to plan for and invest in research capacity, rather than just financing research project by project,” Richardson said. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said the REF was a drain on staff time and resources, describing it as “emblematic of a research culture obsessed with arbitrarily designating institutions or departments as winners or losers”.",News/Education,Oxford and UCL tipped to win lion’s share of grants in UK research audit,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/12/oxford-and-ucl-tipped-to-win-lions-share-of-grants-in-uk-research-audit
5/12/2022,"Nurses are judged to make the biggest contribution to society in Britain, ahead of doctors and teachers, a poll of the public has found. YouGov asked a representative sample of 1,805 adults which group from a list of five types of professionals contributed the most to society. Nurses topped the table (chosen by 16%) with doctors and teachers in joint second (12% each). Next came scientists (6%) and engineers (4%). “The public knows that nursing staff go above and beyond in all they do for patients and those in our care,” said Pat Cullen, general secretary and chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), which commissioned the research. “These findings show how much the public revere, admire and value nursing staff.” Nurses’ special place in British esteem is well established. They have topped the pollster Ipsos Mori’s veracity index – an annual survey of which professional groups the public trust most to tell the truth – every year since they were first included in 2016. In the most recent edition last December, 94% of those surveyed said they trusted nurses to be truthful, ahead of librarians (93%), doctors (91%) and teachers (86%). Advertising executives had the lowest trust rating, at just 16%, followed by politicians and government ministers (both 19%). Ruth May, England’s chief nursing officer, said: “It is fantastic to read that the public considers the work nurses do so highly. No doubt their tireless work throughout the pandemic and to this day has had a huge part to play in that.” However, the YouGov survey also found that 70% of Britons think there are too few nurses to give patients proper medical care. The most recent NHS figures show that the health service in England is short of almost 40,000 nurses. Miriam Deakin, the director of policy and strategy at the hospitals body NHS Providers, said: “Workforce shortages in the NHS are the most pressing concern for trust leaders and colleagues across health and care. “We have 110,000 vacancies in trusts alone, high levels of burnout and worrying numbers of staff resigning from the service.” Meanwhile, the four home nations’ chief nursing officers are backing a new campaign called Here for Life, which aims to raise awareness of the roles nurses and midwives perform and the skills they deploy. It is also intended to encourage potential recruits to consider becoming a trainee. “The Here for Life campaign is about highlighting that careers in nursing and midwifery are highly skilled and require a combination of professionalism, commitment, knowledge, competence and compassion. “We hope that future generations of nurses and midwives will be inspired by these stories and make the choice to join the professions,” said Prof Jane Cummings, the chair of the RCN Foundation, which is running the initiative.",News/Society,Nurses top UK poll on who makes biggest contribution to society,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/nurses-top-uk-poll-on-who-makes-biggest-contribution-to-society
5/12/2022,"Welcome aboard: now beat this. Manchester City knew they were getting a purring, relentless, blond machine of a player who uses strength, speed and guile to breach defences in equal measure before marking the fact with a zen-like pose. They just did not realise Kevin De Bruyne would tick every single one of those boxes on the week Erling Haaland agreed to address their need up front, such as it is. The Belgium international replicated his new colleague’s trademark celebration after burying his third goal and if it was an act of kinship then it was also a reminder that, for all the understandable excitement around their new toy, City want for virtually nothing when De Bruyne is fully plugged in. As De Bruyne stood with arms outstretched and fingers pursed, Phil Foden dashed across the Molineux turf to join in. Foden shook his head, a wry chuckle splashed across his face, and it did not take a professional lip-reader to interpret the comment he directed to someone out of shot. “What is this guy like, eh?” was the gist. It was a reaction matched by those who were merely spectating from the sidelines: disbelief on the one hand; on the other, awareness that nobody should put such feats beyond a footballer who continues raising the bar six weeks before his 31st birthday. The received wisdom is that a perfect hat-trick takes in left foot, right foot and header. Left foot, left foot and left foot fitted that description well enough in the case of De Bruyne’s first three. There was something for everyone: a precise, angled finish across José Sá for the first; an opportunistic capitalisation on the Wolves keeper’s uncertainty for the second; the third rasped into the far corner from range after a surge between two defenders. It is well documented that De Bruyne’s left side is his weaker one, although everything is relative. The story goes that, as a child, he caused so much damage to the garden of a friend’s family when cracking balls here and there with his right foot that he was only allowed to play if he promised to stick to his left. Wolves were left to curse the family’s horticultural pride but they were hardly the first. In the summer De Bruyne scored a similar effort to the last of his strikes here for Belgium, helping them past Denmark. His version of average is most people’s interpretation of the spectacular. “It’s just [a case of] whenever you get the opportunity, don’t hesitate,” De Bruyne said when questioned, beside the Molineux pitch, about his excellence with that less celebrated limb. “I’m never afraid to shoot with the left; even if it doesn’t go in, it creates a problem for the opposition. If you miss you miss, it doesn’t matter, you make mistakes in the game and you go again.” The point about causing problems was fair. When, towards the end of the game, a left-foot strike went slightly off beam it still rapped Sá’s upright. “It should have been five, to be honest,” the errant shooter lamented. His willingness to have a crack only told part of the story. Perhaps more instructive was the fact that two of De Bruyne’s four goals came after he had attempted to set somebody else up. Number two stemmed from a perceptive pass on the turn towards Raheem Sterling, who could not quite connect but was present enough to draw a convenient ricochet off Sá. A right-footed fourth came after he had fed Foden, whose cross towards a poised Sterling was deflected into his path by Rayan Aït-Nouri. “I have the feeling he is enjoying scoring goals, not just making assists,” Pep Guardiola said, and there was something delightful about the fact De Bruyne had been able to capitalise on his own generosity. Selfless yet ruthless: it is a devastating combination and should have yielded at least one assist, Foden hitting the post in the second half after De Bruyne had played him in. Two minutes into the game De Bruyne had swung a delicious, teasing cross inches beyond a sliding Foden. It was an early signal that he was operating close to the point of maximum expression, but hardly even counts as an appetiser. Was this the complete individual performance? It was pretty close, and in one sense capped when De Bruyne was booked in the last quarter-hour for a cynical check on Aït-Nouri. He had committed a similar, unpunished tactical foul on Chiquinho during the first half. Even in producing one of the season’s most memorable displays he had paid heed to the darker arts that play their own smaller, if less important, role in City’s success. De Bruyne’s stock in trade, though, is the sublime. “I didn’t even know,” he claimed of the fact he just happened to have mimicked Haaland’s yogic celebration. “I just did it because I’d scored three.” He is famously as unassuming as they come, but anyone would forgive him a meditation on his own excellence.",Sport/Football,Kevin De Bruyne sets Manchester City standard Erling Haaland must match | Nick Ames,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/11/kevin-de-bruyne-sets-manchester-city-standard-erling-haaland-must-match
5/12/2022,"More than half of people hospitalised with Covid-19 still have at least one symptom two years after they were first infected, according to the longest follow-up study of its kind. While physical and mental health generally improve over time, the analysis suggests that coronavirus patients discharged from hospital still tend to experience poorer health and quality of life than the general population. The research was published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine. “Our findings indicate that for a certain proportion of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors, while they may have cleared the initial infection, more than two years is needed to recover fully,” said the lead author, Prof Bin Cao, of the in China. Until now, the long-term health effects of Covid-19 have remained largely unknown, as the longest follow-up studies to date have spanned about a year. The absence of pre-Covid-19 health status data and comparisons with the general population in most studies also made it difficult to determine how well patients with Covid-19 have recovered. For the new study, researchers sought to analyse the long-term health outcomes of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors, as well as specific health impacts of long Covid. They evaluated the health of 1,192 participants with acute Covid-19 treated at Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 7 January and 29 May 2020, at six months, 12 months and two years. The average age was 57 at discharge. Assessments involved a six-minute walking test, laboratory tests, and questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life, whether they had returned to work and healthcare use after discharge. Health outcomes at two years were determined using an age, sex and comorbidities-matched control group of people in the general population with no history of Covid-19 infection. Six months after initially falling ill, 68% of the patients reported at least one long Covid symptom. Two years after infection, more than half – 55% – still reported symptoms. Fatigue or muscle weakness were those most often reported. Regardless of the severity of their initial illness, two years later, one in 10 patients – 11% – had not returned to work. Two years after initially falling ill, the patients were in poorer health than the general population, with 31% reporting fatigue or muscle weakness and 31% reporting sleep difficulties. The proportion of non-Covid-19 participants reporting these symptoms was 5% and 14% respectively. The Covid-19 patients were also more likely to report a number of other symptoms including joint pain, palpitations, dizziness and headaches. In quality of life questionnaires, Covid-19 survivors also more often reported pain or discomfort and anxiety or depression than non-Covid-19 participants. The authors acknowledged limitations to their study. Being a single-centre study from early in the pandemic, the findings may not directly extend to the long-term health outcomes of patients infected with subsequent variants, the Lancet Respiratory Medicine said. Like most Covid-19 follow-up studies, there is also the potential for information bias when analysing self-reported health outcomes. “Ongoing follow-up of Covid-19 survivors, particularly those with symptoms of long Covid, is essential to understand the longer course of the illness, as is further exploration of the benefits of rehabilitation programmes for recovery,” said Cao. “There is a clear need to provide continued support to a significant proportion of people who’ve had Covid-19, and to understand how vaccines, emerging treatments and variants affect long-term health outcomes.”",News/World news,"Half of Covid-hospitalised still symptomatic two years on, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/covid-hospitalised-long-symptomatic-two-years-on-wuhan-study
5/12/2022,"Hundreds of organisations, including drug companies, private healthcare providers and universities, have breached patient data sharing agreements but not had their access to patient data withdrawn, a report reveals. “High risk” breaches were revealed to have occurred at healthcare groups, pharmaceutical giants and educational institutions including Virgin Care, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Imperial College London, during audits by NHS Digital, according to an investigation by the British Medical Journal (BMJ). This means these organisations were handling information outside the remit agreed in data contracts and may be failing to protect confidentiality, the journal said. In one instance, local NHS commissioners allowed sensitive, identifiable patient data to be released to Virgin Care without permission from NHS Digital. When auditors tried to get access to Virgin Care to check their compliance, they were denied access for several weeks and the company refused to delete the patient data, the BMJ reported. Records about mental health, including children and young people, those with learning disabilities, diagnostic imaging and other confidential patient data was being processed outside the scope of objectives agreed with NHS Digital, at an address that had not been agreed, and without a data sharing contract. A spokesperson for Virgin Care said it had “robust data protection in place”. “It is outrageous that private companies and university research teams are failing to comply,” said Kingsley Manning, the former chair of NHS Digital. “How is it that these organisations can be so lax with data?” The BMJ’s analysis of NHS Digital audits found that in the past year 33 organisations were audited and each one had breached data sharing agreements. Hundreds more have been found in breach since audits began in 2015. GSK was found to be at high risk regarding “compliance, duty of care, confidentiality, and integrity” by NHS Digital’s auditors in December 2021. It had breached the terms of its data sharing agreement with NHS Digital in 10 ways, including allowing four unauthorised GSK data analysts in North America to access the patient data. GSK also processed and stored NHS patient data in locations that had not been declared, according to the BMJ. A GSK spokesperson told the Guardian the company had “worked hard” to ensure “all of their recent audit findings have been fully addressed”, adding: “This is reflected by NHS Digital’s decision to reassess GSK’s risk rating as ‘low’.” A health research unit at Imperial College London was also deemed high risk in August 2021. Identifiable, sensitive patient data was not encrypted while in transit between the primary datacentre and the back-up site. Two doctoral students were also given unauthorised access to the data supplied by NHS Digital, the BMJ reported. Imperial College London said it “fully accepted” the findings of this audit and had “quickly put in place an action plan to tackle the matters raised”. None of the organisations had their access to NHS Digital’s data curtailed in light of the breaches. NHS Digital said it was working with the organisations to rectify problems. “These breaches will damage public trust that data is being handled safely and securely,” said Natalie Banner, the former lead for the Understanding Patient Data initiative hosted by Wellcome. “The current system is failing to protect data adequately and a major policy shift and investment is needed.” Phil Booth, coordinator of campaigning group medConfidential, called for real consequences if companies, commissioners and research teams breach their agreements, warning that breaches of data sharing contracts would otherwise be meaningless. He said: “These contractual requirements aren’t just for fun: a single data breach could include sensitive information about millions of patients.”",News/Society,"Hundreds of organisations breached patient data rules, reveals BMJ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/11/hundreds-of-organisations-breached-patient-data-rules-reveals-bmj

Under cross-examination on Wednesday, Person 11 agreed the AFP had twice asked him to submit to a formal interview concerning his actions while deployed to Afghanistan. Person 11’s lawyers responded on his behalf to the AFP, saying he “respectfully declines the offer to participate in a record of interview as part of the AFP investigation into his conduct during ADF operations in Afghanistan”. Nicholas Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, put it to Person 11 that he was concerned by the AFP investigation because “there’s a risk that investigation may turn into a prosecution”. Person 11 told the court: “To the best of my knowledge, I’m just aware they wanted to question me, that’s what the statement says. I’m not aware of an AFP investigation.” Owens said Person 11 was “refusing to accept the obvious fact” he was being investigated by the AFP over war crimes allegations. “I respectfully disagree with you Mr Owens,” he said. Person 11 was interviewed three times by the inspector general of the Australian defence force, the court heard on Wednesday. He was excused from a fourth interview on mental health grounds. Owens alleged Person 11 had come to court in the defamation action to give false evidence in order to derail an AFP investigation into possible war crimes. Owens put it to Person 11 he was motivated to lie because if Roberts-Smith won his defamation action the chances of charges being laid against him would be lessened. “That is not true,” Person 11 said. Owens put it to Person 11 he had also come to court to demonstrate loyalty to Roberts-Smith, understanding that if either he or Roberts-Smith testified against the other, it would prove “almost insuperable” to their own cases. “I put to you that you have come here to give a false account of Darwan because you realise that the truth would have very serous adverse consequences for both you and Mr Roberts-Smith?” “That’s not true,” Person 11 replied. “The truth would have the opposite effect. The truth, I hope, will prevail, and it will clear [us].” The court also heard on Wednesday that Person 11’s lawyers had been organised for him by Roberts-Smith. Documents tendered to the court showed Person 11 had accrued more than $125,000 in legal fees, but he said he was unsure who was paying the bill. “I’m not aware of any arrangement about who is picking up the tab. I understand it’s an extensive amount of work,” Person 11 said, but he did not know the details of his legal liabilities. “I have not seen invoices.” Last month, invoices were tendered before the court showing Channel Seven was being billed for Person 11’s legal fees. The court has previously heard the legal bills for some soldiers called as witnesses by Roberts-Smith were being paid for by Channel Seven, a publicly listed company and Roberts-Smith’s employer, until the arrangement was revealed in court, after which Channel Seven requested the fees be paid by Australian Capital Equity, the private company of the Seven chairman Kerry Stokes. The chief operating officer of Australian Capital Equity is James McMahon, a former commanding officer of the SAS.

Person 11 denied this: “There are allegations of [Roberts-Smith] as a war criminal and against me as a war criminal, yes, but we each have our own paths to tread to clear our names.” The alleged murder of Ali Jan is the most notorious allegation of this complex defamation trial – the newspapers allege as part of their defence the murder was a “joint criminal enterprise” between Roberts-Smith and his subordinate, Person 11. Roberts-Smith and Person 11 have both denied the allegation, telling the court they opened fire on the man – an insurgent spotter – after they discovered him hiding in a cornfield and carrying a radio in his hand. Earlier on Wednesday, Person 11 said he had felt hurt that Person 4, formerly one of his closest friends in the SAS regiment and the best man at his wedding, had made allegations he was involved in an unlawful killing in Darwan. “I was aware in 2018 that Person 4 had said certain things which had given rise to these allegations, and I felt incredibly hurt that someone who was so close for a number of years, who had been a mentor and good friend, not just professionally and personally, would say such things that would cause such grief and heartache.” Person 11 said he had severed his friendship with Person 4, but denied he was angry with him. “I pity him, I feel for him. He was a great friend, a great man. I know that he struggles, I understand his struggles.” Person 11 remains in the witness box in the trial before justice Anthony Besanko.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith: SAS soldier tells defamation trial he refused to be interviewed by AFP about Afghanistan,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/ben-roberts-smith-sas-soldier-tells-defamation-trial-he-refused-to-be-interviewed-by-afp-about-afghanistan
5/12/2022,"Had Celtic appointed Mark Lawwell as head of recruitment 12 months ago, with Rangers in the midst of title celebrations, the cacophony from an irate supporter base would have punctured eardrums. As the son of Celtic’s former and longtime chief executive Peter Lawwell, there would have been guilt by association in the eyes of paying customers. Seeking a 10th title in succession, Celtic had not so much meekly surrendered to their city rivals as imploded. Mark Lawwell was indeed hired by Celtic, days ago and to barely a murmur. Ange Postecoglou endorsed the choice. Postecoglou’s photograph was used in the club media story that confirmed the move. The manager’s status in the eyes of Celtic’s following is such that he could add Ally McCoist to his coaching staff and supporters would find a reason to nod in agreement. Celtic, from such a weak position at the point of Postecoglou’s arrival, are the champions of Scotland once more. Postecoglou can do no wrong. All things Lawwell are pertinent here, with the Celtic regime of recent times deserving to be treated by history far more fairly than was once the case. Dermot Desmond, the principal shareholder, is another who was vilified as Celtic toiled on the field. Desmond’s pursuit of Eddie Howe was ultimately a failure but football has a habit of throwing up unorthodox tales of glory. Celtic hit upon Postecoglou, who has proven the perfect fit. This has been a period of concerted domestic success for Glasgow’s green half, with the Premiership campaign of 2020-21 the clear exception. Rangers will point to their off-field meltdown of 2012 as mitigation for playing clear second-best over a decade. Not only was that scenario not at all of Celtic’s doing, the Ibrox club continued to spend vast sums on player wages while scuttling about in the lower leagues and later seeking to win back the main title. Since Rangers won the 2011 top flight, Celtic have secured 22 major trophies, including the Scottish Cup of the same year. Rangers will cite the claiming of a league flag that matters – no Scottish club has won 10 in a row – but the overall picture serves as a reminder of which club is the country’s dominant force. That should not be taken as a dismissal of Postecoglou, who having arrived from Yokohama F Marinos has transformed the atmosphere around Celtic and flown past a Rangers team not at all weakened after winning the league. This, moreover, amid a Celtic squad rebuild. Postecoglou has been a welcome addition to the scene on umpteen levels. His refusal to berate referees, patronise opposition managers or delve into the kind of small-time soundbites that Old Firm managers can lapse into is to his credit. Postecoglou keeps himself very much to himself, including within Celtic’s training complex, but there are endearing tales of kind acts in the background that paint the Australian in a positive light. In a football sense Postecoglou wants to know what opposition teams are likely to do without giving any hint of altering Celtic’s approach because of this. In time, especially with a Champions League campaign upcoming, this could be portrayed as a lack of versatility that will cost Celtic but for now he presides over a group with complete belief in their coach. Plan A has worked. Thirty-one league games unbeaten – Celtic endured a rocky league start as Postecoglou found his feet – illustrates the momentum that swept Rangers aside. Desmond and the Celtic board have complete faith in Postecoglou’s ability to identify signings, which means substantial summer transfer backing is a near certainty. In Kyogo Furuhashi, Postecoglou has delivered Scotland’s most gifted attacking player. Top-six Premier League teams pondered a move for Matt O’Riley from MK Dons while sceptical over whether the midfielder could make the leap from League One. Celtic’s £1.5m purchase of O’Riley looks certain to pay off by way of a significant profit. Much is made of Celtic’s front‑foot, high-octane play, which can be a joy to watch. Yet there is a steeliness to this team that is widely underplayed. Key moments in this title race include Tony Ralston’s 97th-minute winner at Ross County in mid-December and Celtic’s 2-1 win at Ibrox in early April. On both occasions fortitude won the day. Celtic will celebrate this title in the knowledge of how readily they were written off before a ball was kicked. How little we all knew. The green-and-white grip on the Scottish game is such that excitement and anger over events of a year ago look a little silly now.",Sport/Football,Ange Postecoglou is the perfect fit for Celtic and now has title to prove it | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/ange-postecoglou-perfect-fit-for-celtic-title
