12/13/2021,"The UK’s Covid alert level has been raised, indicating substantial pressure on the NHS, amid concerns over the rapid increase in Omicron cases. The decision to move from level 3 to 4 was taken following advice to ministers from the UK Health Security Agency, the UK chief medical officers and NHS England’s national medical director.  They said: “The emergence of Omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services. Early evidence shows that Omicron is spreading much faster than Delta and that vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from Omicron is reduced.” Level 4 is defined by the government as “a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation; transmission is high and direct Covid-19 pressure on healthcare services is widespread and substantial or rising”. Announcing the decision, the chief medical officers and the NHS England medical director said the NHS was already under pressure unrelated to Covid and “with a variant spreading with increased transmissibility and reduced vaccine effectiveness, we are likely to see this pressure rise soon”.

12/13/2021,"Government whips are braced for a major rebellion by Tory MPs over new plan B Covid restrictions due to come into force this week, against a backdrop of anger over rule-breaking Christmas parties. The restrictions are set to pass – but only thanks to support from Labour. Ahead of the Commons votes on Tuesday on mask-wearing, working from home and Covid passports, these are the camps that are set to oppose at least some of the measures.  Hardliners There are seven Tory MPs whose have become serial rebels on Covid restrictions, with their refusals to back the government stretching into double digits. Though they have not opposed every measure since the pandemic began last spring, they have generally judged ministers to be imposing disproportionately tough curbs that are not based on evidence. This hardline cadre of libertarians includes former cabinet minister Esther McVey and the chair of the 1922 Committee backbench group, Graham Brady. The latter wields particular influence among others in the party, and his standing up to Downing Street has helped embolden others to do the same. Other notable senior MPs who have held firm against what they see as unnecessary restrictions are William Wragg, the chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, and Charles Walker, a member of two committees that look at House of Commons procedures and sign off restrictions for politicians, staffers and others who work in the Palace of Westminster. Walker was so incensed about extending Covid regulations in March 2021 – a year after they had been in force – that he took to claiming he would carry around a pint of milk as a symbol of his protest. He said the milk could represent opposition to “the roaring back of a mental health demon brought on by lockdown”, “a loss of career or job or business” or “this country’s slide into authoritarianism”. The hardliners are of a view that the country must learn to live with Covid and that a cycle of fresh restrictions whenever a new threat is thrown up by the pandemic is not a sustainable way to live, nor the right way to govern the country. Vocal but tempered critics Then there is a more sliding scale of around three dozen Conservative MPs who take different issue with Covid restrictions. Some have raised concerns over the isolation policy for people identified as close contacts of a positive Covid case, citing the “pingdemic” last summer, while others have been more muted about domestic restrictions but feel strongly about barriers to international travel, whose efficacy has been questioned. Mark Harper, chair of the Covid Recovery Group, has been fairly agnostic on the recent reintroduction of compulsory masks in more settings, but much more vocal about the idea of vaccine passports. Steve Baker, deputy chair of the same group, has said the Conservative party needs to be truer to its belief in the freedom of the individual, and accused ministers of a “creating a miserable dystopia”. Another Tory MP – and a former health minister – Steve Brine, claimed the idea that ministers accepted the country would have to learn to live with Covid was “dead”. This group of vocal but tempered critics of Covid restrictions were sometimes more accepting of measures, but have become increasingly determined to speak out against the government’s approach in the run-up to winter, fearful that plan B is a slippery slope towards lockdown and concerned that people will not be able to see family and friends over Christmas. Newbie rebels While many Conservative MPs have supported all Covid restrictions, the number who will rebel this week is set to rise considerably. Previously fairly loyal and keen to keep No 10 happy and their ministerial hopes alive, some are preparing to rebel over plan B. Many are from the 2019 intake and include Lee Anderson, Matt Vickers and even Jill Mortimer – who was only elected in a byelection in Hartlepool seven months ago. Others are more resolutely opposed to the idea of vaccine passports, though they have been watered down by the government to include proof of a recent negative test result to gain access to some venues. However this has still not won over many. Another new-intake MP, Alicia Kearns, said she “cannot justify introduction of Covid-19 passports just in case and without the data”. Around six Tory MPs who act as ministerial aides are also known to be opposed to vaccine passports, and are either trying to get permission to miss the vote, given Labour’s support means it will definitely pass or, if not allowed, plan to abstain or vote against the plan – and be prepared to lose their job. Jacob Young, the new MP for the red wall seat of Redcar, is said to be among them.",News/World news,Who are the rebel Tory MP factions that plan to oppose plan B Covid restrictions?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/who-are-the-rebel-tory-mp-factions-that-plan-to-oppose-plan-b-covid-restrictions
12/13/2021,"Boris Johnson will deliver a televised address to the nation at 8pm on Covid booster vaccines amid growing concern about the highly-infectious Omicron variant. The prime minister’s intervention follows a further 1,239 cases of the variant being confirmed on Sunday in the UK – nearly double the number reported the previous day.  There are major worries in Whitehall at findings by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) that having two doses of a Covid vaccine offers less defence against symptomatic infection from Omicron than the current dominant variant, Delta. Johnson is not expected to announce any new Covid restrictions. Cases have also recently increased to levels not seen since England’s third lockdown, with 58,194 new infections reported on Friday – the most since 9 January. The figure dropped on Sunday, reflecting the usual weekend effect, to 48,854. While ministers were relatively relaxed about higher case levels because the link between infection and serious illness – including hospitalisations and deaths – had been severely weakened, they now fear Omicron could have changed the equation. Earlier on Sunday, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, revealed there were patients being treated in hospital with Omicron. He told Sky News that the variant was “highly infectious” and that “very quickly Omicron will be the dominant variant in the United Kingdom and probably the rest of the world”. Zahawi said Johnson would be saying more on Sunday about speeding up the rollout out of booster jabs, adding: “It is now a race between the booster and that protection and the Omicron variant.” The number of true Omicron cases that have not been discovered or sequenced yet is likely to be up to 10 times higher than the number of confirmed cases, Zahawi also said.",News/World news,Johnson to address nation at 8pm on booster jabs amid Omicron concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/johnson-to-address-nation-on-booster-jabs-amid-omicron-concerns
12/13/2021,"Sale produced an archetypal game of two halves in their Heineken Champions Cup win over the Ospreys to leave the Sharks’ director of rugby Alex Sanderson happy with victory but far from satisfied. Sanderson saw his team race into a 21-3 half-time lead, but they did not score after the break as their discipline imploded. Sale conceded a mammoth 18 penalties and received two yellow cards.  It meant the Gallagher Premiership side missed out on a bonus-point win. The Ospreys went into this game on the back of hearing their hooker Ifan Phillips had suffered life-changing injuries in a road traffic accident and they struggled badly to start with but their response in adversity was admirable. “We are very happy with the outcome, but there are some things we could have done a lot better,” said Sanderson. “An 18-4 penalty count and playing with 14 men makes it tough. “We were clinical at times and back to our best with our physicality, but we couldn’t get a foothold in the second half and it was penalty after penalty. I’m disappointed not to score four tries because I felt we were good for it.” The Ospreys warmed up with Phillips’s name on the back of their shirts as fundraising efforts to support the 25-year-old in his post-rugby career continue. Phillips’s injuries mean he will not play again. The Ospreys head coach Toby Booth described the buildup to this game as an “emotional week” and his team were caught cold by Sale’s physicality. The Sharks’ power game was too much for the Welsh side to handle and Rohan Janse van Rensburg, Ewan Ashman and Jean-Luc du Preez all powered over in the first half. The watching Wales head coach Wayne Pivac would not have been impressed with two of his potential Test centres in Owen Watkin and Michael Collins both missing tackles for Van Rensburg’s try. AJ MacGinty kicked all three conversions with Gareth Anscombe booting an Ospreys penalty. A yellow card for Lood de Jager before the break for taking out Morgan Morris following repeated Sale maul infringements pointed to future Sharks problems and so it proved. In the second half, the breakdown became a total farce as both sides piled into the contact area knowing the Italian referee Andrea Piardi’s decision making was swinging back and forth. With the England flanker and captain Tom Curry and his twin brother Ben in their back-row, Sale were always going to be a menace at the breakdown, but they kept on conceding penalties. Tom Curry was forced off injured in the second half, but Sanderson allayed any serious concerns. “Tom is carrying an old man’s back at 23,” he said. “He took it through the autumn and if he needs a bit of time off to freshen up, we’ll give him that. “The breakdown got a bit messy and we could look to blame the referee, but we have to look at our own actions first.” The Ospreys were much better in the second half and had the dominant scrum, a platform from which they scored when the captain Rhys Webb threw a long pass to wing Luke Morgan who dived over in the corner. The Wales fly-half Anscombe was forced off at half-time and his replacement Josh Thomas kicked the conversion and a penalty. Ben Curry was the second Sale player to be sin-binned late on. But their defence saw them hold out for the win although Sanderson will know his team can improve significantly from this display. The England scrum-half Raffi Quirke thought he had grabbed a bonus-point try late on after chasing a long kick, but the score was ruled out even though he seemed to have beaten Collins to the ball. “It would have been magical to get a bonus point, but when you are betting on millimetres, it’s pretty desperate,” said Sanderson. His opposite number Booth said: “It’s been an emotional week, for sure. It wasn’t spoken about as a motivator but, in a perverse way, that performance almost epitomised Ifan as a guy. “He’ll be the first to say he’s not the tallest, but he’s plucky and I thought our performance was plucky. He always got stuck in and made the best of it. I suppose our performance looked a little bit like that.”",Sport/Sport,Sanderson unhappy to miss bonus point as Sale sink Ospreys in Champions Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/ospreys-sale-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
12/13/2021,"Two asylum seekers caught up in a mass stabbing attack at a Glasgow hotel have issued a high court claim against the Home Office and their accommodation provider, the Guardian has learned. The men, one of whom said he reported concerns about the attacker to hotel management the night before the stabbings, are also calling for an independent investigation.  On 26 June 2020, Badreddin Abadlla Adam, a 28-year-old asylum seeker from Sudan, stabbed six people including a police officer at the Park Inn hotel in Glasgow before police shot him dead. One of the two asylum seekers now bringing a challenge lost his spleen in the attack and is on lifelong medication as a result. His asylum claim was refused in July this year and he is appealing against the decision. The other had supported Adam as he witnessed his mental health deteriorate after he was moved, along with 320 other asylum seekers, from self-contained accommodation into hotels at the start of the pandemic. On the evening before the attack, Adam told him that he wanted to stab people, he said. The asylum seeker reported this to hotel management and said he believed the threat was credible. The next day he was woken by the sound of the fire alarm and when he opened his bedroom door he saw people lying on the ground in pools of blood. This man is awaiting a decision on his asylum claim. Both men say they do not blame Adam for the attack because his mental health had declined sharply. But they expressed serious concerns about alleged failings by the Home Office and the housing contractor Mears. The evidence provided to the high court shows how tensions at the Park Inn hotel built before the attack. Many asylum seekers experienced worsening mental health. Some reported feeling dehumanised by their treatment and said if they raised concerns about mental health they were told to “open the window” or “have an orange” while others were told to return to their home country if they did not like Britain. Witnesses to the attack said they were traumatised and some had nightmares, PTSD and flashbacks. The asylum seeker who was stabbed said he was now fearful of going out and felt abandoned by the Home Office and Mears. The second asylum seeker said they were made to feel like criminals when interviewed by police. He told the Guardian: “I would like to see asylum seekers getting better treatment instead of being prisoners in hotels. I really do not blame Badreddin for what he did, he was in a very bad state. I blame the Home Office and I blame Mears. They did not listen enough.” Sheroy Zaq, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is bringing the high court challenge, said: “Vulnerable people continue to die whilst accommodated by the home secretary and her associated private contractors, and this will likely continue unless and until lessons are learned. All that the claimants seek, which ought to be uncontroversial, is that a lawful investigation takes place into such tragedies, as opposed to what appears to have happened to date; the home secretary marking her own homework by way of an internal and unpublished review.” Dylan Fotoohi, of Refugees For Justice, a group founded after the attack and an interested party in the case, said: “Thousands have suffered physical and psychological damage in these hotels. This tragedy was preventable. The underlying cause is the dysfunctional and unaccountable way asylum accommodation is managed. An independent inquiry is needed so that lessons can be learned.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Following the incident at the Park Inn hotel we commissioned an internal review to assess the circumstances, in line with routine procedure, however a Scottish fatal incident investigation remains ongoing. We take the welfare of those in our care extremely seriously.” Police Scotland assistant chief constable Steve Johnson said: “The circumstances are being independently investigated by the police investigations and review commissioner under the direction of the lord advocate, therefore we are unable to comment further.” Mears was approached for comment.",News/UK news,Men bring court claim against Home Office over Glasgow hotel stabbings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/12/glasgow-hotel-stabbings-court-claim
12/13/2021,"Allen and Unwin  I keep thinking about the formal gambit on which Scary Monsters is built: it is a book with two faces. Quite literally: it has two covers, two sets of end pages, and it forces the reader at the outset to choose where they begin. It’s a device more complex and consequential than it first seems, because there’s only one opportunity to read one section of the novel unencumbered by the other, to read innocently. And because the sections could each, in theory, stand alone, and because the ties between them are allusive and never overt, the connections and conclusions a reader might draw are up for grabs. It’s an inventive and playful book, funny and heartbreaking, and beautifully accomplished. – Fiona Wright Read more: Michelle de Kretser turns the novel upside down: ‘My aim was to play with form’ Pan MacMillan There are memoirs that tell extraordinary personal stories and hold the reader’s attention because, well, the stories are extraordinary. Then there are memoirs that take it to another level, threading greater meaning through the narrative thanks to the supreme skill, grace and intellect of the writer. In Amani Haydar’s hands, the terrible story of the murder of her mother by her father becomes so much more than that: she transforms it into a thoughtful meditation on memory, culture, patriarchy, intergenerational trauma and, ultimately, hope and renewal. This book is stunning. – Lucy Clark Read more: ‘I was filled with dread’: after her father killed her mother, Amani Haydar found words to heal Text publishing In her third volume of edited journals, How to End a Story: Diaries 1995-1998, Helen Garner covers the implosion of her third marriage. Almost unbearably intimate, her forensic reports on the tensions between two writers and her slowly breaking heart have operatic intensity. After the controversy of The First Stone, with no room of her own, she struggles to write and examines herself in therapy. Yet amid misery, she finds joy and silliness, and sees Sydney with an ever-curious Melburnian eye. The diaries throw light (and shade) on the career of a great Australian writer who can shape an archetypal drama from life’s daily mess and knows exactly how to end a story. – Susan Wyndham Read more: Helen Garner: I always liked my diary better than anything else I wrote Allen and Unwin Debut books of short stories can follow something of a pattern: some pyrotechnics to show range, potentially autobiographical elements, a singular perspective or worldview that separates the author from the pack. But while all of this is true of She is Haunted, this book is a true original, with skilled, delicate power and an unforgettable mix of raw humour, fantastical digressions and melancholy insight. Reviews of debut fiction often lean on phrases like “prodigiously talented” and “bursts on to the scene”. Again, these are true of Paige Clark but don’t do her justice. This is one of the most enjoyable, memorable Australian books of this year. – Michael Williams Read more: Paige Clark: ‘My husband finished his album from hospital. His death taught me how to live’ Hardie Grant Torres Strait Islander author and activist Thomas Mayor introduces readers to his poignant collection of father-son letters by writing how colonial institutions have taught his people to “hate themselves”. Resounding postcolonial stereotypes – such as the caricature of the hopeless Indigenous parent perpetuated by an infamous Bill Leak cartoon five years ago – have further demonised and demoralised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men. Mayor’s book offers a positive counter-response in which First Nations men, writing mostly to their children (but sometimes to their fathers), lay bare the generational legacies of the “colonial stain” of self-criticism through reflections of what it means to nurture and love one another across the generations. These are heartfelt and deeply moving essays that all men can learn from. – Paul Daley Black Inc Sean Kelly’s first book initially doesn’t sound that promising: a biography of Scott Morrisson, for which the subject has not granted the author access. But for Kelly the obstacle is the way. Without Morrison, Kelly can create a narrative that is not dependent on the self that the prime minister wants to show. Instead his book probes Morrison’s absence: that is the absence of a story, of an inner life, of the ability to empathise, and ultimately of the ability to lead. With a variety of literary references, including Joan Didion and Janet Malcolm, Kelly has crafted an intelligent, thoughtful book that ultimately doesn’t just reveal Morrison to us but shows us the “real Australia”. – Brigid Delaney Self-published No Aussie publisher was bold enough to take a chance on Michael Winkler’s debut novel, so Winkler published it himself. Thank the literary gods he did, for Grimmish arrives with its wildness untamed and excesses untamped. This “exploded nonfiction novel” begins with the true-life tale of Joe Grim, a fin de siècle boxer famed for his capacity to endure round-after-round of punishment; a human punching bag. Around Grim’s bruised and bruising life, Winkler crafts a fable of masculinity, pain, art-making and madness. JM Coetzee has called it “the strangest book you are likely to read this year”, and he’s spot on. Grimmish has all the makings of a cult classic. It’s grotesque and gorgeous, smart and searching. And did I mention the talking goat? – Beejay Silcox Allen and Unwin 2021 has been a great year for fiction for me – particularly by Australian writers. Wild Abandon stands out as a favourite because at the peak of such an exhausting, depleting time it was an absolute delight to read something so lush and full of energy. I’ve always loved Bitto’s writing, but her joy in experimenting with craft and character shines through on every page of this. And while there is something expansive and liberating about Will’s journey from Australia to New York to the deep heartlands of America, there is also genuine pathos, and an understanding of the endless search for connection that drives so many of us. This book is wondrous. – Bec Kavanagh Read more: Wild Abandon by Emily Bitto review – a thrilling, irreverent take on the great American road trip UQP Chelsea Watego is inspired by two great contemporary philosophers, Audre Lorde and bell hooks. The result is a book that only Watego could have written, a galvanic critique of colonial complacency and institutional racism in Australia. Watego herself experienced a trial by fire in academia, when a piece she wrote for an academic journal heavily criticising a white author’s book was pulled from publication and resulted in defamation threats (the piece is reprinted here). The penultimate chapter, Fuck Hope, is essential summer reading. Another Day in the Colony is a wonderful continuation of the critical race and feminist critiques of thinkers such as Jackie Huggins, Lilla Watson, and Aileen Moreton-Robinson. – Declan Fry Read more: Another Day in the Colony by Chelsea Watego review – a fierce manifesto for First Nations to flourish Black Inc In suburban 1980s Melbourne, 16-year-old Karuna falls pregnant. Enraged, her mother confines the teenager to their commission flat, where she yearns for escape and independence. This claustrophobic, epistolary novel is beautifully nuanced in exploring the chasm between mother and daughter, especially where culture is concerned – Pung writes with empathy for both characters, even if the mother’s actions appear outwardly monstrous. As with her other works of fiction and nonfiction, Pung’s handling of race and class is impressive, providing great insight into the complexities of both. One Hundred Days isn’t always an easy read, but it is an important and moving one. – Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen Read more: ‘Teenagers can deal with tough things’: Alice Pung on the complexities of race, class and motherhood Text publishing Krissy Kneen was raised on a “strict diet of fairytales”, the frayed threads of her family history always woven into fables. The chief mythmaker was her Slovenian grandmother, Lotty: a mystical, matriarchal woman who spurned any probing inquiry into her obscured past. After Lotty’s death, Krissy is liberated to unearth the kernels of truth in her grandmother’s tales, to discover the lineage of her ancestors and where she might overlap with them – “skin to skin, blood to blood”. This peripatetic memoir is an absorbing chronicle of that journey, with Krissy travelling with Lotty’s ashes from Australia to Slovenia to Egypt. It’s an intimate tale of identity – as well as of bodies, inherited trauma, and memory – and is its own heady cocktail of truth and lore. – Jack Callil Read more: The Three Burials of Lotty Kneen by Krissy Kneen review – memoir as both fairytale and defiant truth Penguin Random House This brooding novel from Briohny Doyle tells the story of a young mother on the brink of breakdown, struggling to manage the needs of her neuro atypical son and hounded by the memories of sexual assault and harassment she experienced as a teenager. Doyle sets this core narrative against the backdrop of a town slowly drying up – both figuratively and literally – unable to withstand economic and climate pressures. Then, a single, horrific act rocks its people to the core.

If you eat and you care about the environment and food supply chains, Chan’s exposition of this enormous part of Australia’s economy and culture – not to mention actual landmass – is an urgent wakeup call. Her knowledge of policy in this area is without peer; her prodigious storytelling abilities and analysis make this subject timely, relevant and readable. – Lucy Clark Hear more: Gabrielle Chan on why you should definitely care about farming – podcast Text publishing Given the various traumas and societal failures that have dominated our news cycle for the better part of 2021, Bodies of Light – Jennifer Down’s vast novel of grief, institutionalisation, pain and loss – might not feel like an easy recommendation for the reader seeking escapism or respite. But if you’re feeling robust enough to give over to the forensic, immersive story of one woman’s attempts to survive tragedy over many decades, the rewards are considerable. Bearing witness to Maggie’s abuse, to her thwarted and often heartbreaking efforts to escape her past and ultimately to overcome it may leave you wrung out, but Down is a beautiful writer and this epic novel is first and foremost about strength and resilience. – Michael Williams Read more: Bodies of Light by Jennifer Down review – remarkably empathic tale of vulnerability Self-published No book this year moved me half as much as Emma Do and Kim Lam’s brilliant history of outwork in Australia. Written by Do and illustrated by Lam, it tells a story of Australia during the 80s and 90s, when Vietnamese migrants and refugees struggling to find regular employment became outworkers. The result is a stunning portrait of resilience despite adversity; of small wins and larger injustices, and of little reprieves in the face of larger marginalisation. It is an intimate look at what it means to cultivate a life, a family, a home: how care is the basis upon which our existence depends, in both the smallest and largest parts of our lives. When Do observes that “everything you wear has passed through skilled hands”, the larger analogy is impossible to miss.

No writer has documented her own life more obsessively than Mears, the dazzling Australian author who wrote, loved and lived passionately, until her death at 51 from multiple sclerosis in 2016. Brennan brings scholarly discipline and an appreciative open mind to her subject’s nonconformist life: her turbulent relationships and complex sexuality, her debilitating illnesses and search for alternative treatments, her travels to a Venezuelan mountaintop and into the Australian bush. All was in service to literature, as Brennan shows in her sensitive reading of award-winning stories and novels, ending with the triumphant Foal’s Bread. – Susan Wyndham Scribe Black and Blue is the extraordinary kind of memoir that has you laughing and then, in the next paragraph, feeling like all the wind has been taken out of you with shock. Veronica Gorrie tells her story of growing up as a Gunai/Kurnai woman in Australia, and then going on to be a police officer in Brisbane where she witnessed and was the target of personal and structural racism. Her voice is so clear and sharp it feels at times like she is talking directly to you and she has a unique gift of threading a story with small details and sideways routes that add to the odd charm of the book. It is a story of great resilience but also of great love, in her family and also in her community. – Bridie Jabour Read more: ‘I had not one friend in the job to debrief with’: life as an Indigenous police officer Scribe It says something about the past year that the books I found myself most lost in were set among the hippy idealism of the 70s: Allison Gibbs’ Repentance, Jonathan Franzen’s Crossroads (don’t @ me) and Miles Allinson’s In Moonland among them. In Moonland – Allison’s second novel – is a generational saga that begins in modern-day Melbourne, when new father Joe becomes fixated on learning about his dead father Vincent. But the most escapist bits are set in the past: vivid, dreamlike scenes spent with Vincent, who gets lured into the ashram/cult of the magnetic mystic Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (AKA Osho) in India in 1976. It’s by no means a hopeful read, but it’s beautifully written and took me to another world, another time. Which: yes please. – Steph Harmon Allen and Unwin The two protagonists of Love Objects are both such kind-hearted but complicated characters, witty and brittle and bruised by the world, that they have stayed with me all year. Nic is cheeky, a bit offbeat, and so full of compassion that it almost hurts. Her niece Lena is feisty but riven with doubt, and entirely unprepared for who and what she encounters in the adult world. Love Objects is about their relationship, and about family and care – but it’s also about class and how it carries across generations, as well as the choices and outcomes it makes available or closes off, despite our cultural insistence to the contrary. – Fiona Wright Read more: Love Objects by Emily Maguire review – a compassionate, harrowing portrait of a hoarder Allen & Unwin The brilliant intensity of this memoir grabs you by the scruff in its opening pages and doesn’t let go. Novelist Kathryn Heyman takes the reader back to her early 20s when, fleeing a traumatic sexual assault and subsequent court case, finds work as the only female deckhand on a fishing trawler in the wild and stormy Timor Sea. It’s cinematically dramatic, yes, but also measured, as Heyman intersperses her compelling narrative of personal transformation with broader reflections on her childhood, on male violence, class, and the redemptive power of language to describe the world and her place in it. Along the way she places stepping stones many women will recognise – from everyday insults to serious assaults – all of them rising to a sense of cold, implacable fury that builds throughout. In a lesser writer’s hands it could have been overplayed, but Heyman is meticulous with pacing and structure. – Lucy Clark Read more: Kathryn Heyman on writing her ‘white hot’ memoir – and finding refuge on the Timor Sea UQP Predominantly set in Melbourne – for Tony Birch a place of struggle, grief and violence, but also community, quiet generosity, and kindness – Dark as Last Night gives the reader 16 carefully crafted short stories. Like much of Birch’s oeuvre, central to this collection is the experience of children and the ties that bind siblings. The way love and care is shown contrasts with the difficulties of resolving past hurt and present grief.

Instead, Wilson considers the things that mark us – death, grief, rage – and what a joy it is to watch his compassionate mind at work. Reviewing Wilson’s book for Guardian Australia, Bec Kavanagh observed: “he writes with an expectation that people can do better, and provides plenty of opportunities for them to do so”. It’s this generosity – this open-hearted trust – that makes As Beautiful As Any Other so potent. “Once the question of being alive had been answered, I had to figure out how I wanted to live,” Wilson writes.

Through these lenses, this polyphonic book-length essay makes a compelling argument for solidarity, resistance and rebellion. Crawford’s background as a zinemaker is evident through her inventive approach here – some pages have only a single line, and some simply an empty box. Part of the experience and pleasure of reading No Document is choosing how to. Crawford has taken risks with form, and it’s paid off – despite the book’s slim size, it’s expansive in thought and an utterly original work of creative nonfiction. – Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen Scribe In her past books, Laura Elizabeth Woollett has dwelled on the actions of “bad men”. In The Newcomer, she turns her gaze from perpetrators to their victims. When a young woman is found murdered in the small community of Fairfolk Island, her mother is distraught. But the deceased wasn’t always easy to like, and her actions in her time on the island mean not many are inclined to delve into her death. Woollet poses many questions in The Newcomer, including what makes a sympathetic female victim, how grief can consume us, and where the line is drawn between loyalty to a place versus justice for a person. – Zoya Patel Read more: The Newcomer by Laura Elizabeth Woollett review – murder in a Pacific island paradise Duke University Press An Australian based in the UK, Ahmed is a founding figure of affect theory, as well as a highly regarded queer and critical race theorist. Complaint! is fueled by intimate experience: in 2016, Ahmed left her post at a British university over its treatment of sexual harassment. Complaint! comprises interviews with forty students, academics, and administrators variously involved with formal complaint procedures, not only around sexual harassment, but sexism, racism, and bullying. The result is a collective intervention full of humour and a sardonic intelligence, as Ahmed describes how sharing class notes is a way to recognise that “an incident, an event, a one-off, has a longer history”. She concludes by reminding us how a single act of complaint can set off a chain reaction, leading to the creation of collectives for shared experience, shared critique and, ultimately, shared change. – Declan Fry",Arts/Books,"The 25 best Australian books of 2021: Helen Garner, Alice Pung, Tony Birch and more",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/13/the-25-best-australian-books-of-2021-helen-garner-alice-pung-tony-birch-and-more
12/13/2021,"I guess the joke’s on me because I still watch it, but I don’t find Succession as compelling as everyone else seems to. The plot goes nowhere, the interpersonal relationships coast along at the same level of sociopathy, and the whole thing feels like being beaten over the head with a big hammer labelled: “Get this – power corrupts!”  Yeah, yeah, I know. We all know. The only reason I don’t find the Second Gilded Age label compelling for our time period is that it has connotations of sublime luxury, whereas the current world seems suffused with a depressing sense of drab crapness. Gold just isn’t the appropriate textural signifier of our ugly, tasteless post-postmodernity. I have similar aesthetic problems with using the word “nepotism” to describe what happens in Succession, even though it’s accurate. Nepotism comes from the Italian for nephew, nipote, and originated with medieval popes who elevated their nephews to the cardinalate. Why, I asked myself, did popes care so much about their nephews? Well, at least sometimes because they were “““nephews”””, that is, illegitimate sons. A grubby practice, but one I picture happening within the brocade-strewn, oil-painted, marble-ceilinged context of pre-Enlightenment Vatican splendour. A grand, sacrilegious form of corruption. Compare this to the adult Roy children, dressed like mid-tier real estate agents, slinging uncool compound swear words (“He’s a slime badger!”) at each other in a grey corporate boardroom with low-pile polyester carpeting, while their grizzled old psychopath dad rolls his eyes and wonders where he went wrong. It’s just not the same; it’s degraded, ugly, crap. The label “nepotism” marks a boundary between acceptable and unacceptable forms of favouritism. At the acceptable end, we could think of things like using some money to buy your child a birthday present while other children don’t have enough food to eat. (Unless you’re Peter Singer, in which case that’s right out). We generally accept that family relationships create a set of duties by which the parent is bound to maximise the child’s health, wellbeing and future prospects; if a parent doesn’t do that, we consider them a deadbeat or a failure. When do family duties turn into nepotism? Well, somewhere between the birthday gift scenario and Waystar Royco. Precisely where? When preferencing your own child over another affects the common good. The power of compound interest combined with nepotism produces economic inequality, a material harm; rampant nepotism causes lowered trust in authority and social structures, because it undercuts the value of legal equality. This second harm is a purely modern one. In pre-industrial societies, the bonds and duties of family were how economic and political activity was organised. Nobody would think it immoral for the local artisanal chair maker to take his sons as apprentices into the chair-making business — in fact it would be weird if he didn’t. Only the cracking-apart and reorganising of those economic kinship structures produced a world in which the common charge of nepotism even makes sense. It’s instructive that the original perpetrators were popes, not merchants or kings, because religious authority could be compromised by petty worldliness in a way business and politics couldn’t. Making your illegitimate son a cardinal somewhat cheapens the divinely-instantiated structure characteristic of the church, doesn’t it? Your Holiness, are you absolutely sure it was God who inspired you to appoint the kid you had with a servant girl to a position in the ecclesiastical hierarchy? In more recent times, nepotism is apt to manifest as embedded patronage matrices of mates. The most powerful of these, the ones embedded in government, put on a big show of respect for “the electorate” out the front, but you don’t have to peer very far round the back to see that the revolving door is never still. I think there really is a difference in kind between institutionalised “jobs for the boys” networks and the type of friend-favouring everyday people might do in helping someone they know score an interview or a role. The powerful are motivated by just that — securing and maintaining their own control. It’s not just high-value altruism when a politician stacks an authority with their allies, it’s quid pro quo. See enough of this and you feel like you’re being told one long aristocrats joke where the punchline is “Democracy!” Nepotism is a thoroughly attested human pastime, it’s meritocracy that is weird – the idea that an individual person can be severed from their familial context, evaluated against an objective set of standards, and assigned a societal position on that basis – is freaky and new. To be honest I’m not that into meritocracy either. Sure, I enjoy the fruits of the economic rationalisation process the same as everyone else, but there’s a part of me that is very attracted to the idea of simply being given a track in life. If we could somehow combine that with an egalitarian distribution of material resources, I’d be into it. Nobody gets to be the Queen because your mum was the Queen, but maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if I’d been inducted into my dad’s vocation (playing bass in extremely niche 1980s post punk bands – cool, right?). The problem with nepotism as depicted in Succession isn’t really the nepotism per se; it’s how emotionally hideous and alienated everyone is. On one hand we have a small group of genetically affiliated incompetents depicted with more power than the president, but on the other hand, they’re all extremely unhappy! It’s like an advertisement for bloodless, liberal meritocracy. Sounds great! Just give me a second to bite down into this cyanide capsule. The original nipotes, though, make nepotism look pretty groovy. Your father loves you and wants you to be happy, you get to be a cardinal, everyone still believes in a loving God, and your chamberpot is probably inlaid with Italian malachite. I think there’s something nice there to be re-appropriated, even if nobody wants the wholesale reconstruction of the First Estate.

12/13/2021,"Boys are running in rows of three down the court. Legs, shouts, the smack of bouncing balls. As one boy passes to another, the third fans out to take the next pass, then he leaps and dunks. Some boys are already in flight and soaring towards the basket when they take the ball, almost delicately, then slam it through the hoop. On the side a man in a blue tracksuit watches intently, but not so much that he fails to see a boy trying to slip unnoticed into the gym, a hard thing to do when you are 200cm tall.  The boys training at the Police Citizens Youth Club in the Blacktown suburb of Shalvey “Akuei!” Mayor Chagai calls out. “Why are you late?” The boy, hands in the pockets of his black tracksuit pants, looks uneasy. He missed a train connection at Granville, he mumbles. “You’re coming from Campbelltown? What time did you leave?” “Ten-thirty,” says the boy. That is four-and-a-half hours ago. To be fair, Campbelltown is almost 50km from here, but Chagai is not satisfied: “Why didn’t you leave at 8?” Akuei shrugs, looks down, and says quietly: “Mum was at work.” “And you had to look after the kids, right?” Chagai’s tone softens. “All right.” But then: “Why didn’t you text me? You text next time you’re going to be late. OK, jump in.” Akuei enters the line, waiting to join the boys flowing in waves down the court. “I wanted him to explain to me what was going on,” Chagai, the founder of the Savannah Pride basketball club, says. “If he gets a job and turns up late, then doesn’t communicate to the boss why he’s late, then he won’t have that job.” Chagai, who left his village in South Sudan at the age of seven and wandered across three countries before arriving in Sydney in 2006 as a 22-year-old refugee, wants to teach his players not only how to dribble and dunk a ball but how to study and work and take their place in society. He is trying to develop not just good basketballers, but fine human beings. The story unfolding in this spare gymnasium in Blacktown, a western Sydney municipality that contains some of Australia’s most disadvantaged urban areas, is about more than sport. It is about how a community and a country are built. Start with map and compass in George Street, in the Sydney CBD. Head 30km west and a little north, upriver. At Parramatta, strike west for another 10km, up a hill or two, down another. When you reach the heart of a wide open plain, nearer to the Blue Mountains than the sea, you’re in Blacktown. It’s not a journey that many Sydneysiders who live closer to the sea ever make. Which is a shame, because the joke that journalist Joanne Vella remembers being made in the newsroom of The Blacktown Advocate might well be true: “You haven’t been to Australia till you’ve been to Blacktown.” More than 4 million people have arrived in Australia in the past 25 years. Most newcomers have moved to the big cities, but few have moved into the inner cities, which have become gentrified, increasingly monocultural, and locked up by prohibitive housing prices. Instead, recent migrants have had to look to the urban fringe. Lueth Awan arrives for training As a result, an unprecedented transformation of Australia’s population has occurred out of sight of policymakers, captains of industry, arts and culture leaders, academics and journalists. This century Blacktown has received three main streams of migrants: refugees from South Sudan, Bhutan and Afghanistan, among other places; people of Pacific Island background and Māori; and migrants coming on skilled visas, mainly from the Indian subcontinent. The largest overseas-born groups today are the nearly 26,000 residents born in India – Blacktown’s most common surname in 2015 was Singh, followed by Smith and Jones – and 22,000 in the Philippines. Blacktown also has more people born in South Sudan than any other municipality in Australia. These migrants followed other waves of migrants since the second world war: first the British and Irish, then other Europeans, including Italians, Hungarians, Poles and Maltese, the last of whom came, in many cases, to work in the market gardens on the city’s edge. Blacktown also contains Australia’s largest urban Indigenous population, of about 10,000 people. It includes members of the original Darug people, but most Indigenous residents moved to Blacktown from regional New South Wales after 1960. Joseph Amelsom Blacktown’s population of nearly 400,000 numbers about 180 different national backgrounds, with more than 40% of people born overseas. As late as the 1950s the municipality was mainly countryside. That means nearly everyone, apart from the Darug, is in one way or another a recent migrant. It is Saturday afternoon at the Police Citizens Youth Club in the Blacktown suburb of Shalvey. The under-18 squad of the Savannah Pride basketball club has been training for 15 minutes, but Chagai – or “coach,” as players call him – has been taking training sessions since five in the morning. All Saturday and on weeknights he trains groups from under-12 to open age – about 250 players in all, including 20 girls. The players are mostly South Sudanese, but there are also Islanders, Lebanese, Chinese, Serbians, Italians and Anglos. One white boy from the Central Coast played just one game against Savannah Pride, in which his team was smashed. He was so impressed that he asked Chagai if he could join, and now makes the two-hour journey to Shalvey every weekend to train. Chagai keeps all his players’ numbers in his phone, and often those of their parents, too. Savannah Pride runs a homework club (suspended during the pandemic) and Chagai gets parents to send him school reports. Any student suspended from school is temporarily banned from games against other clubs. But if a player overdoses and ends up in hospital, or does something that lands him in a police cell, Chagai will turn up to take him home. This club in western Sydney has caught the eye of the basketball world. American scouts have swooped on Savannah Pride, recruiting 23 of its players to play college and high school basketball in the United States. Duop Reath, who represented Australia at the Tokyo Olympics, played for a time with Savannah Pride. Chagai has featured in The New York Times and on the ABC’s Australian Story, and is the subject of a planned movie. Joe Mantegna, head coach of Blair Academy, a basketball boarding school in New Jersey, has said that Savannah Pride is “impacting more people than most of us ever do in a lifetime”. Pachong Malok Over two Saturdays at the Shalvey PCYC gym, Chagai tells me a little of his long journey from the savannah of Africa to the streets of Sydney. As he speaks of the friends he lost along the way he seems to be carrying sorrow, but when he talks about the game he loves, his face lights up, almost grows mischievous. He has two sides, but they come from the same place. Sport, he says, must be fun, or young people will not play. Even more importantly, players who enjoy the game can learn to take risks and believe in themselves. The best players are great, Chagai says, not because they have skills or fitness, but because they make good decisions, free of fear. Chagai wants his players to play instinctively, to trust themselves and their teammates. Confidence in the game can lead to confidence in work and in life. He learned all this, he says, in his journey through Africa, as a refugee. At the age of seven, Chagai left his South Sudanese village, where his family herded cattle. Over the next 15 years he trekked to Ethiopia, then to the world’s biggest refugee camp, Kakuma in Kenya, then back to South Sudan as a child soldier for the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army. He left his village with a cousin to avoid war but war followed him. Bombs fell and battles exploded around him and his companions. Many died of illness or hunger, drowned, or were eaten by wild animals. “Nearly all the people I knew at that time are dead,” he says. “No food, no sleep, hide in the swamp, dig the roots of plants to eat. No day, no night, all time was the same. Someone can be walking around and in the next few minutes, dead. As long as you breathe, that’s all you know.” In Kakuma, which he reached at the age of nine, he discovered he had a rare gift for basketball, and the courage to play it. He had seen fear kill people, make them give up and drown, or die of thirst. But in the savannah, with wild animals all around, he had overcome his fear. What, then, did he need to fear on a basketball court? As Chagai speaks, a small boy waits respectfully at a distance: could he go home? “Have you called your mum?” Chagai asks. The boy shakes his head. “Here,” Chagai hands the boy his phone. “He’s new, very shy,” Chagai says. “A lot of kids have no parents, or no dads, a lot of single mums. I see myself in them.” After getting back to South Sudan as a teenager, he played in Kenya, Uganda, Egypt. His talent was spotted, and he was offered scholarships to the US, Spain and France. Then he fell during a tournament and badly broke an arm. His dream of a basketball career in the US died with that fall. He accepted a refugee visa for Australia, and arrived in Blacktown in 2006. Every refugee is unlucky, but while camps in some countries were peaceful, the same cannot be said for the South Sudanese, whose journey to Australia was marked by violence, hunger and war. Their arrival presented Blacktown with the biggest test of its multiculturalism in its history. From the mid-2000s, groups of young black men could be seen hanging around the Blacktown CBD. They were part of a rapidly growing South Sudanese population in the municipality. The council felt frustrated that neither the federal nor state government had provided any notice – let alone funding – to help it manage the change. Many locals were also unhappy. Some demonstrated in the street, with ugly signs. “There was a real fear at the time,” says Michelle Rowland, who was a Blacktown councillor in that period and is now MP for the federal seat of Greenway, which covers half of Blacktown. “Council got this constant feedback: ‘There are all these tall, dark people standing around and I feel intimidated. This is not the Blacktown I used to know, I don’t feel like I belong here any more.’ I always thought it was bizarre: doesn’t everyone stand around? You’re just noting that they’re black. But the fact that it never boiled over into race riots was really lucky. Some non-government organisations stepped in to help but a lot of the work fell to the local area command of the police.” The local commander, Mark Wright, had taken the Blacktown job in 2008 with a brief to reduce youth crime, especially at the station and Westpoint mall. Westpoint had just become the first shopping centre in Sydney to ban students during school hours. Groups of young people were stealing with abandon, businesses were leaving the mall. On Thursday nights, crowds of young people would come by train from across Sydney and gather on the fourth floor of Westpoint to watch young men of all backgrounds trade punches. Wright says it was known as “fight night”. Former Blacktown commander Mark Wright Wright began by pulling leaders of ethnic communities, schools, welfare bodies, churches and a Westpoint manager around the same table. He asked them one question: what do we do? Out of those meetings emerged many ideas and one coalition: Com4Unity (coming together for unity). The most important initiative came from youth workers, who polled 2,500 young people around the train station and mall about activities they wanted to see in Blacktown. People said they wanted more opportunities to dance, perform and play music. As a result, Switch, a dance and music showcase, was held on the same Westpoint floor where “fight night” used to occur. Critically, the event was run by young people themselves. “I still get goose bumps when I think about it,” Wright says. “Rotary had the barbecue going, the mayor would be sitting in the front row, and you’d have 300 or 400 young people singing, dancing – that top floor was pumping.” Atem Mayol After Wright left his job in 2014, and other Com4Unity leaders also moved on, the initiative did not survive. Yet the impact on Blacktown seems to have lasted. “Mark [Wright] had a very big role in transforming Blacktown,” says Om Dhungel, who sits on the NSW police multicultural advisory council. “Blacktown station used to be very scary in some way. Young people standing around; you had to navigate through them so you didn’t get pushed. That’s all changed.” When Chagai arrived in Australia in 2006, he found the country strange, hostile. He and about 10 other young South Sudanese formed a basketball group, but whenever they tried to play a scrimmage game at the PCYC in Blacktown, one particular police officer would kick them out. A Parramatta stadium also kicked them out. I ask him why he thought that happened. “We were different, and we were black.” When the group tried to play scratch games on outdoor courts around western Sydney, groups of boys would appear and challenge them to a game. Often the boys were Islanders but some were Lebanese, Aboriginal, Caucasian. The Sudanese always won, which often caused fights. Sometimes the boys would leave and return with baseball bats, even knives. Chagai was spending all his time pulling away his boys, who wanted to fight back. He was near despair. One day a Sudanese leader in Blacktown, Ajang Deng Biar, called him. The multicultural liaison officer at Blacktown police, Assefa Bekele, wanted to meet the basketballers. Warily, Chagai and seven other young men agreed to attend a meeting with police commander Wright. In the meeting Wright got straight to the point: what did the players need? Chagai said they needed just one evening on a basketball court and basketballs, as they had no money. Wright said he would arrange a month’s trial at the PCYC. If there were fights or other troubles, they were out, but if the trial went well, police would extend it. Chagai asked: when is this going to start? “Right now,” said Wright. And he, Biar, another Sudanese leader, Mary Mamur, and the players left the meeting and walked through the streets of Blacktown to the PCYC. Wright booked them in. He also booked a meeting for two days later, at which he laid out the new approach to the officer who had banned the Sudanese. Bekele took the players to Rebel Sport in Westpoint and bought them two basketballs. Joseph Amelsom The trial was a success. Wright helped the group secure a three-year grant from the Department of Immigration to pay four part-time salaries. He also joined the Savannah Pride board, and is now chair. “What started out as a mentor relationship has become much more than that,” says film-maker Brendan Fletcher, who is making a movie on Savannah Pride. “Mayor has no family here, and very few elders in Sydney who can play that role for him. Mark is one.” Basketball NSW and the Women’s World Cup have asked the club to run a trial “dads and daughters” program focusing on South Sudanese families. Involving girls is a challenge, Chagai says. “We are trying to build up, but Sudanese parents do not like their daughters playing sport or being too long out of the house.” Chagai says Sudanese boys receive more attention because their struggles have been more visible, but “a lot of girls are suffering mentally – they just hide it”. Chagai has to return to coaching. I talk to others on the sidelines of the gym. “Coach is really tough, but it’s to get the best out of us,” says Isaac (Achek) Chol, an 18-year-old player whose uncle is Deng Adut, the criminal lawyer from Blacktown who was the 2017 NSW Australian of the Year. Chol says that Chagai “doesn’t sing out, but he tells us straight up when we’re being lazy, and if you don’t like it, tough”. Chan Deng This year Chol got into Macquarie University, but to study business administration, not law, as he had hoped. He was downcast, but Chagai told him not to lose heart; he could transfer later. “He’s definitely made me more resilient,” Chol says. “Mayor is a beautiful, beautiful man,” says Kasia Rettig, a Polish immigrant whose 15-year-old son, William, plays with Savannah Pride and coaches its younger boys. “My boy doesn’t see his father. Mayor has been like a father to him.” Savannah Pride began as a South Sudanese club. But in 2015 three players who went to boarding school in Bathurst asked if they could bring two white friends, Will and Daniel, to training; those players are still with the club today. Through word of mouth and socialising after games, players from other African backgrounds joined, and some Iraqis, too. A Ghanaian had an Indian friend – could he come along? Two Islander boys joined after Chagai and Joe Tau, the youth worker who had helped to run Com4Unity, organised three camps to diffuse longstanding conflicts between boys of Sudanese and Islander backgrounds. In time, Savannah Pride became the diverse club it is today. Mayor Chagai says that Australia remains a “very tough” environment for South Sudanese people, yet over the years he has become an optimist about Blacktown. Mayor Chagai talking to the team at the end of the training session He says that when he first arrived in Blacktown, “people would spit on us, call us cockroaches. The police would harass kids – I wrote so many letters to Mark Wright about it. Now we Africans have got achievements in sport, people have gone to university, joined the police force. In Blacktown, we still have a few racists, but they are being outnumbered by people who are willing to say, ‘Blacktown is a better place now.’ That’s an amazing thing that has happened.” Chagai says he will never forget something Lorraine Landon, a Savannah Pride board member, told him 10 years ago. “I was very upset. I kept hearing, ‘These refugees are bad.’ I said to Lorraine, ‘When are we going to become accepted in this country?’ “She said, ‘Mayor, this a bad part of people who feel entitled to say that only they are Australian. It’s not fair, it’s not good, but you have to be resilient. It happened to the Italians, the Vietnamese, the Chinese. You have to fight through it, and it will fade away. But it will never go away if people don’t fight through it, positively. Australia is a great country that welcomes everyone. It will welcome you.’ “I felt so deeply about what Lorraine said,” Chagai remembers. “I thought, ‘That’s true’.” Chagai has sat with young men charged with serious crimes, who have asked to see him from their cell. “It takes a village to raise a child is an African proverb,” he reminds me. Just the other day, one of his players, Akol Mawein, texted him from the University of Oklahoma, where he is on a scholarship worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mawein sent Chagai a photo of him mopping the floor at the Blacktown PCYC with an Islander boy, an Aboriginal boy and a couple of white boys. People in Oklahoma did not know where he came from, Mawein texted. “This is the place where I started bouncing a ball when I was 10.” Chagai first called his club Star Basketball, but six years ago, he gave it the name it has today. He wanted to honour the friends he had lost. He was the lucky one. He had survived the savannah. He wanted others to survive it, too. “We share some fates with the wild animals,” he says. He still remembers watching the animals gather on the savannah, under the shade of the trees. “They just sit there together. We, too, are a group of people getting together – as a group, as a family, as a pride.” This article is based on a narrative paper on Blacktown written for the Scanlon Foundation Research Institute.",News/Australia news,‘Blacktown is a better place now’: how a former refugee and coach built pride in his community,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/blacktown-is-a-better-place-now-how-a-former-refugee-and-coach-built-pride-in-his-community
12/13/2021,"Cookbooks are my go-to gift. It’s a medium I know and horde for my own use, so instinctively it’s a love I want to share. I was always told “it’s the thought that counts”, and going that extra distance at this time of year adds that extra halo effect.  Shopping local and independent is a mantra for some. The plight of the indie bookseller is a precarious one and Christmas can be, as with other small retailers, a lifeline. Spare a thought for culinary booksellers – such as Books for Cooks, based at Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne – who also sell online. They can be niche treasure troves – yes, you’ll likely find that latest big-name release, but also books long out of print, or even an antiquarian selection for those wanting to mine the de rigeur dishes of the 19th century. If you’ve time on your hands and a thirst for op-shops, dive into a less curated selection in search of a preloved classic, or a gift that just didn’t land with its recipient last year. I’ve uncovered everything from original Elizabeth David paperbacks, and Len Deighton’s Observer cookstrips classics the Action Cookbook and Ou Est Le Garlic, to as-new modern must-haves like Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi’s Jerusalem in charity shops. Writing cookbooks isn’t a sure thing financially. Increasingly you’ll find authors selling direct via their website or Instagram page. Buying this way is a win for you, as you’ll most likely land a signed copy and maybe some merch, while for them it’s a bigger margin. Making a good choice is knowing your recipient. I like to be bold with choices and open new culinary pathways to friends and family. Say, a veggie deep-dive like Alice Zaslavsky’s In Praise of Veg for the open-minded yet committed meat eater who thinks veg always takes second billing; or, conversely, Meat: The Ultimate Companion by Anthony Puharich and Libby Travers for a lapsed vegetarian. Early in my relationship with my now wife I tested the theory, buying her a copy of Fergus Henderson’s The Whole Beast. She had spent decades as a vegetarian but was tentatively exploring an omnivorous diet. It still has pride of place among a sprawling cookbook collection. The line between books and magazines is blurring, like most media these days, with increasing numbers of mooks, high-end quarterlies and journals. These are spaces where new voices or little-heard perspectives can be found, and a subscription or bundle can be the gift that keeps on giving. Look to publications like Colournary, founded to “amplify the voices of First Nations, Black and People of Colour through the lens of food and culture”, and publishers like Somekind Press, whose lo-fi paperback approach has resulted in a catalogue of page-turners from many of Australia’s most exciting venues, like Pipit, Tom McHugo’s, Ester and Lankan Filling Station. Further mining that rich vein of talent, Cartilage produces recipe card journals with $10 of the $15 cost going back to the venue – a venture that was borne out of a will to help the hospitality industry during Covid, and could have legs beyond it. For food lovers, it’s worth thinking beyond recipe books. A work of narrative non-fiction that outlines real issues can be a refreshing contrast to the gloss of lifestyle-led picture books. I’m thinking Richard Flanagan with Toxic, Matthew Evans with Soil and Gabrielle Chan and Why You Should Give a F*ck About Farming. And finally, call me the cookbook Grinch but with only a few exceptions (namely Nigel Slater’s The Christmas Chronicles) festive themed books should be avoided, especially if you live in Australia. Why? Ultimately, their destiny is to be flicked through and left untouched until next Christmas.

12/13/2021,"The Australian government is on track to deliver deficits totalling nearly $240bn over four years, an estimated improvement of $100bn since the last budget, a respected economic forecaster says. With the government due to publish a budget update on Thursday, Deloitte Access Economics has released its own predictions for an improved bottom line, arguing the economy has been recovering much faster than Treasury assumed seven months ago.  Deloitte says the rapid uptake of vaccines will deliver a “more reliable” economic recovery – but warns that the budget will remain under pressure because government spending on aged care, disability and mental health is still “in catch up mode”. With the government preparing for an election by May, and with both major parties already stepping up their campaigning, this week’s budget update will set the scene for a battle on competing economic visions. The government has brought forward next year’s budget to March, apparently to allow it to deliver a major economic statement before officially launching an election campaign, but Scott Morrison retains the option of going to the governor general any time after the summer break. The budget delivered in May this year estimated an underlying cash deficit of $106.6bn in 2021-22, followed by years of red ink including a shortfall of $57bn in 2024-25. Those four years of deficits added up to $342bn. Deloitte, in a new forecast released on Sunday night, predicted deficits totalling $239bn over the same four-year period – on the proviso that the Omicron variant “doesn’t send many Australians back into lockdown for lengthy spell”. “Our latest assessment is that Thursday’s budget update will reveal lower cash underlying deficits to the tune of $103bn,” said the Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson. “That’s remarkable, given everything that’s gone wrong in the seven months since the budget was released, including Delta’s dawn, iron ore’s collapse, and multi-billion dollar rescue packages.” Deloitte argued that the economy had been recovering faster than Treasury previously assumed. “Even when Delta locked down half the population, the damage to the economy was just a fraction of that in mid-2020,” it said in a statement. “Given that the best way to repair the budget is to repair the economy, that combination of resilience and recovery is helping the budget get its mojo back.” Australia’s surge in vaccinations since early August was “really good news for both the economy and the budget”, according to Deloitte’s analysis, because it indicated the country’s “path from here on is safer and more reliable than that of less vaccinated nations”. The upbeat assessment also reflects a difference between Deloitte and Treasury on a key economic indicator. Deloitte said Treasury’s budget-time assumptions “saw the nominal economy travelling at crawl speed across an unusually long period of time”. While Treasury predicted national income growing at an annual average rate of just 2.8% across the six years between Covid arriving in 2019-20 and the end of 2024-25, Deloitte puts this measure at 4.2%. Richardson said the budget recovery was “remarkable” but “not enough”. “A range of commissions and reports indicate that Australia government spending is still in catch up mode for aged care, disability and mental health,” Richardson said. “And at the same time the world has become more dangerous for Australia, so Defence costs have some catch up ahead too. That says the budget will be under pressure for some years to come.” Richardson said if voters heard “costly promises from politicians in the months ahead” they should treat them with “considerable caution”. The government has attempted to put economic recovery at the centre of its re-election pitch. On Sunday, while announcing that booster shots would be available after five months, the health minister, Greg Hunt, said the Coalition knew “how to give people the best chance at the life of their choice”. He argued Labor would have “no control of the budget”. But the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, argues Covid has “shone a cold, unflinching light on some hard truths about our economy and its vulnerabilities”. At a campaign-style rally last weekend, Albanese pledged to deliver a “stronger, fairer and broader economic recovery” with a focus on secure, well-paid jobs. He said re-electing the Morrison government would ensure “a second decade of stagnant wages that don’t keep up with rising bills”.",News/Australia news,"Australia to improve budget bottom line thanks to rapid vaccine uptake, Deloitte predicts",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/australia-to-improve-budget-bottom-line-thanks-to-rapid-vaccine-uptake-deloitte-predicts
12/13/2021,"At the end of a second year of interrupted schooling thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, Victorian teachers are circumspect. “Last year, we got away with it,” says Melissa*, a primary school teacher in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.  “Everyone was quite worried about the kids, so we really worked hard to make sure they didn’t fall behind. I destroyed myself; the parents, for the most part, pushed themselves as hard as they could. This year, there was a lot of fatigue.” By the time the Delta outbreak hit in June and New South Wales and Victoria went into lockdown, the “novelty” of remote learning had worn off. When students returned to school in October, the effects of 18 months of broken and remote schooling had compounded, Melissa says. “Almost none of my students have moved from where they were in the middle of the year,” Melissa says of the children she teaches in grades prep, one and two. “Nobody can tell the time, nobody can do fractions, nobody can spell anything and nobody can write. If there’s one thing they won’t do for their parents, it’s write. They’ve had two years on and off of just not being taught spelling.” Melissa is not alone in such observations. The preliminary Naplan results released in August were trumpeted by the Victorian government as evidence that the state’s students had defied the interruptions of the pandemic on their schooling. Teachers and researchers alike are awaiting the forthcoming release of the more granular data this month. But there is scepticism that those detailed results will tell the whole story, especially as – since the tests were performed in May – they will not encompass the most recent extended lockdowns in NSW and Victoria, which, anecdotally, were some of the hardest. And they cannot measure the level of social understanding or personal growth in students, or show the overlapping of family circumstances, socioeconomic conditions, social status and temperament that contribute to how individual children learn. Tim* teaches in a Catholic primary school in Melbourne’s south-east. He says he’s worried most about his incoming grade twos. “Overall the remote learning plan was good, but in some places kids were more disadvantaged – where English is their second language, where the kids didn’t have laptops or the internet, or they had dual-income families working essential worker jobs and their parents were not able to support them with remote learning – that was very difficult,” Tim says. While the children’s learning suffered, he says, more concerning is the fact they have had two deeply formative years without the intensive socialisation of school. “When we came back to school after the last lockdown, the kids couldn’t interact with each other properly,” Tim says. “They didn’t know how to take turns, or how to have respectful interactions. They’d been online for so long they had trouble focusing on real people. They might have said things they didn’t mean while online that they wouldn’t have said to someone’s face.” Tim and Melissa both say that their young students needed intensive social and emotional learning activities when they returned to the physical classroom, as they grappled with the behavioural expectations that came from learning and interacting with other people in the same physical environment. Malcolm Elliot, president of the Australian Primary Principals Association, tells Guardian Australia that this is something primary teachers are seeing across the board in places where remote schooling was prolonged. “We’ve seen plenty of examples of children who have gone backwards in their socialisation. Where they had made progress in learning how to collaborate, work with others, and be in the school environment, this has declined. There’s a period of catch-up certainly needed there,” Elliot says. Older children with more capacity for self-direction seemed to better cope with online learning than younger children, but Elliot warns that this depends a lot on highly variable individual circumstances. “Many students have been in circumstances that have been far from ideal in lockdown periods. Students experiencing disadvantages have become no less disadvantaged during the pandemic,” Elliot says. “The circumstances between people vary markedly. There are children in our community, and we have to open our eyes to this, for whom school is their safe place and their home is not a safe place. They will have experienced setbacks in their learning. Some students, particularly socially, will go backwards.” John Hattie, emeritus laureate professor at Melbourne Graduate School of Education, says the key lesson from Covid schooling so far is “don’t presume”. “Every kid deserves to be evaluated and assessed on their own merits,” Hattie says. “Don’t presume that certain categories of kids did better or worse. So-called gifted kids, for example, overly depend on their teacher – they are often very compliant and reliant on their teacher. They suffered in Covid too.” Hattie says we ought to be asking why, from the data made available so far, remote learning appeared to work so well in so many cases. It would be a mistake, though, to presume it worked for all children. “I’m not Pollyanna in believing that Covid was brilliant; it wasn’t. But there’s no question for the majority of kids, though, the key issue [with remote schooling] was [its effect on] friendships. So I’m not going to ever advocate for distance learning, but I do think that a lot of the stuff we learned from Covid should be applied going forward.” Critically, Hattie says, schools shouldn’t be too hasty to return to old habits. “There’s a massive move to rush back to the old normal. Most children know how to play that game, but there’s a large percentage of children who aren’t well-served by the old normal. What an incredible opportunity to learn from Covid about what makes a difference to those children.” The Victorian government has provided money for tutoring to help catch up any students that have fallen behind, which has been gratefully received by schools. It shakes down to an allocation of about $15-$18k per school, though, which means the programs can only target a small cohort or subject. Elliot seeks to reassure parents who might feel responsible for their child’s learning gaps due to their circumstances during lockdown. “Parents shouldn’t feel like they’ve done anything wrong, provided they’ve been kind and thoughtful and loving towards their kids during this time. Any deficit in learning can be repaired and may not take as long as we think.” Still, teachers aren’t expecting smooth sailing ahead. “I don’t know how long it will take to catch kids up because it depends on how interrupted next year is and that depends on Covid,” says Melissa. “In a normal year, really going for it, six months and I think they’d be fine. But that would assume a normal year where everyone’s not tired and families are stable. Everyone planned for a normal year this year and then it didn’t happen. I don’t feel like I can look ahead to a normal year.” * Names have been changed for privacy reasons",News/Australia news,Skipping class: have Victorian students fallen behind because of remote learning?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/skipping-class-have-victorian-students-fallen-behind-because-of-remote-learning
12/13/2021,"After a Gold Coast man who bludgeoned his teenage girlfriend to death escaped a murder charge by arguing he had been provoked by her tales of infidelity, the Queensland government decided to step in. “Other than in exceptional or extreme cases you can’t rely on words, or conduct that consists substantially of words,” the state’s then attorney general, Cameron Dick, said in 2011.  “We need a change to the law … just because you say something it doesn’t mean that you should be killed.” A decade later, another Queensland man, Arona Peniamina, also convinced a jury his spouse’s suspected infidelity had provoked him into ending her life in a jealous rage. The government’s reforms had not prevented him from successfully arguing he was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder, because he had been provoked. As had occurred more than a decade earlier, convincing a jury he had been provoked meant Peniamina would therefore be subjected to a lesser sentence. As the Queensland supreme court judge Peter Davis noted, Peniamina had spent the days leading up to his wife’s death investigating her contact with another man. Peniamina’s case led to more questions about how the Queensland justice system was failing women, and another review of the law as it relates to the use of provocation as a defence in murder cases. Peniamina successfully argued that the suspicion of infidelity provoked him to start assaulting his wife, Sandra Peniamina, and that he was further provoked when she picked up a knife to defend herself. “There are instances where this would help those who were provoked and were protecting themselves,” Sandra’s sister, Carnetra Potter, who is now looking after the couple’s four young sons, told the Courier Mail. “But it in this case did not work in our favour. I believe the [law] should be looked at as a whole.” The attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, agreed, saying the wide-ranging work being done by the state’s women’s safety and justice taskforce would include an examination of the defence of provocation in domestic, family and sexual violence cases. The taskforce did not respond to a request for comment about when the review could be completed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Queensland remains one of the few Australian jurisdictions which allows a partial defence of provocation, allowing the crime of murder to be reduced to manslaughter. As the New South Wales court of criminal appeal justice Anthony Johnson said in April, the partial defence “has attracted criticism”, leading to review and reform during the past two decades. It had been abolished in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and most recently in South Australia, Johnson said. The ACT and Northern Territory have restricted the use of provocation as a defence but not abolished it entirely. Johnson’s comments were made as he denied the leave to appeal application of Warren Francis Rogers, who attempted to argue “extreme provocation” was a factor when he used a pillow to smother his wife of 40 years, Anne Rogers, to death. As he later explained to his son-in-law, Rogers killed her after a fight started because of he was upset by a non-sexual relationship she had with another man. “I’m not a bad person, I just snapped, you know?” Rogers said. “I just snapped … she pushed me too far.” While Rogers’ application was rejected, and NSW does not allow the partial defence of provocation, its unique model is considered problematic by some experts.

The laws were designed to significantly reduce the number of cases under which provocation could be argued, but leave it open as a defence for cases that met a four-staged test, to ensure that victims of prolonged family violence, for example, could use it as a defence should they kill their abusive spouse. Provocation can be considered in sentencing if a person is found guilty of murder. “The government is satisfied that the bill strikes a careful and appropriate balance between restricting the defence and leaving it available for victims of extreme provocation, including victims of long-term abuse who kill their abuser,” the then NSW attorney general, Brad Hazzard, said in introducing the bill. A select committee was established in parliament to examine the laws after the case of Chamanjot Singh, who stood trial for murder after cutting his wife’s throat. Singh claimed during his trial that his wife, Manpreet Kaur, provoked him by telling him she had never loved him and was in love with someone else, and threatening him with deportation. He said he lost self-control and should not be found guilty of murder but of manslaughter, and the jury agreed. In her 2017 research, Dr Kate Fitz-Gibbon, an associate professor at Monash University, found that in the decade before the reforms were introduced, there were 20 convictions finalised in the NSW supreme court for manslaughter by reason of provocation. The majority of these cases involved intimate partner homicide motivated by relationship separation or infidelity, she found. Fitz-Gibbon found that the NSW reforms would eliminate many of these scenarios of what she called “jealous man provocation”. She told Guardian Australia that the Peniamina case was a clear reminder of why the partial defence should be scrapped, as, by its nature, it operated “to facilitate victim blaming narratives”. “We have seen time and time again throughout Australian criminal law history that the partial defence has been successfully utilised by men who have killed their female intimate partners to avoid full accountability for their lethal actions. “It would be naive to think that the abolition of the partial defence of provocation is the entire solution. “We must continue to challenge cultures within our legal system that allow for the proliferation of gendered narratives whereby women are ultimately blamed for their own deaths.” She said that some Australian jurisdictions were currently progressing reforms that would better ensure men who committed fatal intimate partner violence they are held to account. But that did not mean that such offences should be subject to mandatory sentences, as these measures meant men who often raise provocation to mitigate their sentences. “The partial defence of provocation must be abolished in every Australian state and territory, it has no place in our legal system.”",News/Law,‘Jealous man provocation’: the fresh Australian bid to end legal defence used by men who kill their partners,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/13/jealous-man-provocation-the-fresh-australian-bid-to-end-legal-defence-used-by-men-who-kill-their-partners
