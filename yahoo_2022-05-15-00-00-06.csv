5/15/2022,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's President Katalin Novak at her inauguration ceremony on Saturday condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and said her first trip would take her to Poland, in an apparent gesture to mend relations with Warsaw. Hungary's rejection of sending weapons shipments to neighbouring Ukraine and its opposition to a planned European Union embargo on Russian oil imports has weighed on relations between Budapest and Warsaw, whose two nationalist governments have been long-time allies in the EU. Novak, a former Fidesz party lawmaker and ally of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, was elected to the largely ceremonial post of president in March, shortly before Orban won another landslide victory in elections on April 3. Hungary's first woman president, Novak has served as deputy chair of Fidesz and was family affairs minister in Orban's previous government. ""On Tuesday, 17 May, I am travelling to Warsaw to meet the President of the Polish people. Mr. President, dear Andrzej (Duda), I thank you for the opportunity to talk as befits friends!,"" Novak said in her inauguration speech. ""We condemn Putin's aggression, the armed invasion of a sovereign state. We say eternally no to every effort aiming at the restoration of the Soviet Union,"" she added. She said the war in Ukraine was also ""fought against us peace -loving Hungarians"", adding that Hungary demanded that war crimes be investigated and punished. Orban has also condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine but has avoided personal criticism of President Vladimir Putin and has been strongly opposed to any sanctions on Russian energy. Dependence on Russian oil in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia poses the biggest obstacle to an embargo deal that the European Commission, the EU executive, proposed in early May in response to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

5/15/2022,"Greene and Massie have voted against almost every bill passed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The only bill Greene voted for was a non-binding resolution expressing support for the people of Ukraine. At times, the duo have been the only votes against bills that otherwise had unanimous support. Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky have voted against nearly every single bill passed in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a review by Insider of recent House roll call votes. The only exception was a non-binding resolution passed on March 2 in support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, which Greene supported. Massie, meanwhile, joined Republican Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Matt Rosendale of Montana in voting against it. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in late February, Congress has scrambled to respond to what has quickly become the largest land war in Europe since World War II. Insider identified 19 bills â€” ranging from non-binding resolutions, to sanctions packages, to military aid authorizations â€” the House has passed since Russia's invasion began in late February. They include a mixture of new pieces of legislation, as well as previously-introduced resolutions in support of countries besieged by Russia. Some of those measures have attracted substantial Republican opposition in the House, including 57 votes against the recent allocation of $40 billion in additional aid to Ukraine, 56 votes against a bill pushing for debt relief for the besieged country, and 63 votes against a resolution reaffirming US support for NATO. Others have attracted opposition from the left flank of the Democratic Party as well, including a ban on the importation of Russian oil, a bill allowing for the seizure of Russian elites' assets, and a bill aimed at countering Russian and Chinese influence in Eastern Europe's telecommunications networks. But Greene and Massie stand alone in the breadth of their opposition to bills aimed at countering Russia, and they were the only members of Congress to vote against three otherwise-unanimous bills aimed at financially targeting Russia and Belarus. On Thursday, Washington Post columnist Paul Kane asked Greene about her many votes against Ukraine-related bills. Greene posted a clip of the exchange on her official Twitter account and slammed the media as ""obsessed with another country."" ""I feel very sorry for the Ukrainian people, but I was elected to represent my district in Georgia,"" said Greene, listing off concerns about border security, inflation, gas prices, and the baby formula shortage. ""Has it stopped Putin? Let me ask you, has Vladimir Putin stopped his war in Ukraine because of all these sanctions? No, not at all."" She went on to articulate an argument she's made in a couple of different op-eds: that ""globalists"" have a financial interest in perpetrating a war in Ukraine, and that the US must push for a negotiated settlement of the conflict. ""I'd argue MTG has explained why she is opposed to these measures far more extensively than anyone who supports these measures,"" Greene's communications director, Nick Dyer, wrote in an email to Insider. â€”Rep. Marjorie Taylor GreeneðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@RepMTG) May 12, 2022 For Massie, a libertarian who has served in Congress since 2012, the opposition to measures concerning foreign affairs is typical and part of a long-standing record. He was the only Republican to vote present (rather than against) the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, the only member of Congress to vote against extending sanctions on Iran in 2016, the only member of his party to vote against a resolution condemning the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement against Israel, and the only Republican to vote against sending an additional $1 billion in Iron Dome funding for Israel, joining several progressive Democrats in doing so. Massie recently boasted abut his voting record on the Ukraine-related bills, arguing that they ""prolong the war, waste tax-payer money, and increase domestic food and energy prices."" â€”Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) May 12, 2022 Here's a full list of the 18 bills the duo voted against: March 2 - Suspending Energy Imports from Russia Act March 9 - Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act April 5 - Resolution reaffirming support for NATO April 6 - Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act April 27 - Assessing Xi's Interference and Subversion Act April 27 - Protecting Semiconductor Supply Chain Materials from Authoritarians Act April 27 - Ukraine Religious Freedom Support Act April 27 - Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act April 27 - Georgia Support Act April 27 - Resolution in support of Moldova's democracy, independence, and territorial integrity April 27 - Transatlantic Telecommunications Security Act April 27 - Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act April 28 - Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act May 10 - $40 billion in additional emergency support for Ukraine May 11 - Russia and Belarus Financial Sanctions Act May 11 - Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act May 11 - Isolate Russian Government Officials Act May 11 - Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition Act of 2022 Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie have voted against almost every single bill passed by the House to counter Russia's invasion of Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-thomas-massie-133054557.html
