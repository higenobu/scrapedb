4/21/2022,"When my husband was diagnosed with a terminal illness, we decided to consolidate our various pensions so I would only have one provider to deal with after his death. Since December, he’s been trying to transfer a pension pot from Phoenix Life to Nest. Nest confirmed it had contacted Phoenix, but that, frighteningly, Phoenix had no record of his policy. He resent the information to Nest, but it again said Phoenix had no record. Phoenix in turn denies receiving any requests and requires us to prove they had been made. My husband’s aggressive cancer has given him little time to get his affairs in order, and this is his final act to try and care for me. But there’s been not a shred of empathy nor inclination to help.JB, Nottingham Before I could intervene, your husband’s policies were finally identified and the transfer completed. Both companies continued to blame each other for the three-month ordeal, and you still wanted answers as to why you had been caused such needless anguish. Thus began another month-long saga. Nest insisted it provided Phoenix with the necessary information in December and January. Phoenix claimed both contained incorrect information, so were rejected. In the meantime, your husband sadly died, so I tried again to wrest the facts from both companies and got them to communicate directly with each other. Only then, after five weeks’ toing and froing, did Nest discover it was at fault all along. Staff had sent the two transfer requests to the wrong provider within the Phoenix group. Phoenix provided correct details but Nest failed to resubmit the request. Instead, Nest wrote to your husband, less than three weeks before his death, to inform him Phoenix had no record of his pension policy. It was Phoenix which, after you called it and explained the circumstances, contacted Nest and urged it to make the request. The funds were transferred five days later. Nest has pledged to offer appropriate compensation. David Barnes, Nest’s director of scheme operations, says: “We are deeply sorry for the distress this has caused and share our apologies unreservedly; this was the result of human error in our back-office team. It falls far short of the high standards of customer service we seek to provide. “Nest is an organisation which aims to listen and learn from its experiences with members. We’ll be working with our team to ensure this does not happen again.” Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

4/21/2022,"Quarantine hotels for inbound travellers to the UK during Covid have cost the taxpayer more than £400m, a National Audit Office (NAO) investigation has found, including almost £100m in unpaid room bills and fraud. While the government expected the hotels’ costs would be covered by the occupants, it has emerged that the taxpayer has been left responsible for more than half of the £757m bill. The rooms were for those travelling to the UK from high-risk “red list” countries during the pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care, which issued a £385m contract to Corporate Travel Management to run the hotels, told the NAO that about £74m of bills covering rooms and Covid tests have not been paid. Another £18m has been fraudulently reclaimed in credit card chargebacks, but only two cases have been investigated or challenged. The losses were revealed in a NAO report on how the UK managed cross-border travel during the pandemic. The report found that travel rules and border policy were incoherent, confusing and costly, and the government had no way of evaluating if they were worth it. Among other policies reviewed by the NAO were passenger locator forms, introduced in June 2020, for inbound travellers to state where they would be staying and isolating. The report found that since September 2021, less than 1% of the forms were checked by border force officials. The information given was entirely down to self-declaration, while “checks by private-sector carriers focused on the existence rather than the accuracy of data”. The UK Health Security Agency, which had a £114m contract for home visits to check if travellers were self-isolating, could not confirm whether 33% of those required to isolate actually did so. The NAO also criticised the government’s attempts to create a market for Covid-19 testing. It said the DHSC had “limited oversight of the market it created, and service to the public has sometimes been poor”. In February at least 369 private firms offering PCR tests were listed on the government website, with stated prices ranging from £15 to £525. The NAO said the firms “often marketed themselves as being government approved”, but the government listing gave “minimal assurance that they can provide the services”. Between February 2021 and January 2022, the rules for the border were changed at least 10 times. The report said that “poor communication of some measures created uncertainty”, with “minimal notice” causing operational problems for carriers. The NAO found that the government “did not adopt good practice” or have any holistic assessment of the risks of its system, “nor ever stated how its competing objectives of managing Covid risks and reopening travel should be balanced and prioritised”. While departments monitored their own spending on cross-border travel measures, there was no central government tracking of the total, despite costs of at least £486m. The NAO added: “As it has not developed a set of performance measures to track the effectiveness of the measures it has deployed, and with no evaluation of the additional costs incurred, government cannot demonstrate its implementation measures have achieved value for money.” Meg Hillier MP, chair of the public accounts committee, said policy had been “more reactive than proactive, and led to a confusing mishmash of different parts and programmes”. She added: “There was little evidence of a guiding mind behind its approach and poor communication meant the public were often bewildered by the travel advice. “Monitoring those entering the country relied on goodwill, rather than good data. Government never really got a handle on the numbers, nor whether its border measures were working effectively. “Over two years since the pandemic began, government has still not got its house in order. With cases still high and removal of travel restrictions, government cannot afford to be complacent,” said Hillier. Leisure travel was initially banned in March 2020, followed by a system of travel corridors opened in summer 2020 that was replaced by a “traffic light system” in May 2021, with various levels of testing and isolation required. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said the government had had to make changes at short notice during the pandemic but now had “an opportunity to ensure that it develops a systematic approach to managing any future travel measures, applying the learning from Covid-19”. A UK government spokesperson said: “The pandemic was an unprecedented challenge and we acted swiftly and decisively to implement policies designed to save lives and protect the NHS from being overwhelmed. “As the report notes, considerable efforts were made across government to put border measures in place that helped to protect the UK from arriving cases of Covid-19. These measures bought vital time for our domestic response to new and concerning variants, contributing to the national effort to contain and manage the virus.”",News/World news,"UK quarantine hotels cost taxpayer £400m, watchdog finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/uk-quarantine-hotels-cost-taxpayer-400m-watchdog-finds
4/21/2022,"Lifeboat crews and lifeguards around the UK and Ireland saved more than a person a day from drowning in 2021, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has said. The charity saved 408 people last year, an increase of 59 on 2020. Lifeboats were launched 8,868 times, and crews helped a total of 12,903 people – the equivalent of 35 a day. The RNLI is launching its Mayday Mile campaign, encouraging people to complete a mile’s walk or run in May to raise funds for the charity. RNLI lifeboat crew members will complete the first mile on Southend pier, wearing their uniforms. Pete Emmett, the charity’s head of engagement, said: “The RNLI has been saving lives at sea for almost 200 years. We’ve seen a significant increase in the number of people around the UK and Ireland needing our help over the last year, and we are so proud that our brave lifesavers have been there to save them. But running a 24/7 lifesaving emergency service is expensive and costs are rising, which is why we’re calling on people to support our lifesavers. “Every Mayday Mile completed will help give our lifesavers everything they need to continue to keep people safe this summer and beyond. It’s so easy to get involved and to have fun whilst saving lives – last year we saw miles covered on climbing walls, space hoppers, paddleboards and wearing wellies filled with baked beans. We hope to see many more people take up the fundraising challenge this year.” In January the RNLI said it was on course for its highest annual fundraising total in its history, after a rise in public support in response to rightwing attacks the charity faced for saving the lives of asylum seekers crossing the Channel. It raised more than £200,000 in a single day after hitting back at criticisms such as Nigel Farage’s claim that it was a “migrant taxi service”.",News/Society,RNLI reports rise in lives saved last year to more than one a day,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/21/rnli-reports-rise-in-lives-saved-last-year-to-more-than-one-a-day
4/21/2022,"There are games of football that feel like the inevitable product of their circumstances: system against system, the attacking and defensive patterns predetermined days in advance, the result telegraphed from the moment the first ball is kicked. Then there are the games in which Granit Xhaka runs the midfield, a mass brawl breaks out in the closing minutes and Eddie Nketiah scores twice against a team currently sanctioned by the UK government. Chaos, farce, or high entertainment? Probably a mixture of all three. As shirtless Arsenal fans clambered over each other in the Shed End, as a fuming César Azpilicueta remonstrated with some of the few Chelsea supporters who were left in the ground, it was tempting to write this off as a classic slice of freak Premier League, a crunch London derby with all the logic and ambience of a Carabao Cup fourth-round tie. Chelsea remain well ahead in the race for Champions League football. Thomas Tuchel sent out a weakened, experimental XI. Their attentions are understandably divided at the moment. Perhaps this was simply a case of victory going to the team who cared more. But pick through the bones of Chelsea’s third consecutive home defeat and there are signs of legitimate concern. Most obviously you fear for that defence, so impregnable and well drilled earlier in the season, but which has already conceded more goals in 2022 than it did in the first 10 months of 2021. Even Thiago Silva’s introduction at half-time failed to blunt Arsenal’s threat on the counter-attack, the prevailing mood of panic that seems to grip Chelsea every time someone vaguely decent runs at them. And yet, even in the wake of a four-goal trouncing, it felt like a convenient scapegoat had already been identified. Barely a minute before he was substituted to a chorus of boos from his own fans, Romelu Lukaku was making a decisive run to the near post, in anticipation of a cross from Timo Werner. Werner failed to see him and instead cut the ball back into space. And in a way that little exchange summed up Lukaku’s season at Chelsea, a season of misunderstandings and misalignment, in which a £97.5m striker has somehow become the emblem of everything wrong with the club. Certainly you sense that the fans would feel no great nostalgia for Lukaku should Chelsea cut their losses and get rid of him in the summer. Lukaku is an old 28, with more than 600 games in his legs for club and country and lacking some of the pace and sharpness of his early years. He has not scored a league goal in four months. In the last fortnight alone he has missed decisive chances against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final. In the long run, Werner and Kai Havertz and even Armando Broja – on loan at Southampton – are probably more valuable. Even Tuchel, you feel, has reconciled himself to the essential disposability of his record signing, claiming before the FA Cup semi‑final on Sunday that Lukaku was “not fit enough for the intensity of our game”. Meanwhile you can also sense Tuchel’s apathy in the way he talks about Havertz, a player he genuinely seems to love: “He gives us volume, he covers a lot of metres in high intensity, he loves to create overloads and half‑spaces.” Lukaku, by contrast, is described in the terms of a pure finisher: a man who if he is not contributing goals is basically useless. “Of course we want to serve him,” Tuchel said of him earlier this year. “But sometimes he needs to do service as well.” And so Lukaku finds himself in the invidious position of having to adapt to a team that in many ways has moved beyond him, a conventional striker in an unconventional team. Here he ran and he scurried, he toyed with the offside trap, he drifted deep and into the channels. He missed a good chance when the score was still 0-0. He executed a delightful nutmeg on Gabriel early in the second half. And yet for the most part, the ball was inevitably funnelled somewhere else, moved in patterns he is no longer equipped to interpret. This is, lest we forget, a man who scored 24 times in Serie A last season. Who may well go on to break the all-time record for international goals. Who will probably go on to do an excellent job for another club, one built more explicitly around his target-man strengths. In the meantime there will probably be new Chelsea owners within a matter of days, at which point virtually every asset will be evaluated and given a shelf life. With a little time and little love, Lukaku could still thrive at Stamford Bridge. But it’s becoming increasingly clear he has neither.",Sport/Football,Misunderstandings and misalignment mar Lukaku’s season at Chelsea | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/20/misunderstandings-and-misalignment-mar-lukakus-season-at-chelsea
4/21/2022,"Former US president Donald Trump appeared to storm out of an interview with Piers Morgan after he was questioned about losing the 2020 election. A dramatic 30-second advert for Morgan’s new show – Piers Morgan Uncensored to feature on Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTV – also showed the former president calling the presenter “dishonest” and “a fool”. During the interview, Trump, 75, appears to become agitated when Morgan tells him that the 2020 election was “free and fair” and that “you lost”. The former president responds: “Only a fool would think that”. Morgan then asks Trump if he thinks he is a fool, he replies: “I do now, yeah.” The 45th president appeared defensive throughout the preview, at one point telling Morgan: “I think I’m a very honest man, much more honest than you, actually.” He also told the presenter “I don’t think you’re real” when Morgan told him he had failed to produce “hard evidence” to support unfounded and disproved claims of widespread electoral fraud in 2020. Trump is thought to be preparing his own third run for the presidency after losing out to Joe Biden two years ago. The advert, which promises “the most explosive interview of the year”, ends with Trump appearing to walk out on Morgan, telling the camera crew to “turn the camera off”. The 75-minute show will be screened on Monday at 8pm, the launch day of Murdoch’s new television enterprise. Although his News UK says TalkTV will not be a traditional rolling news channel and will also feature entertainment, documentaries and sports programming, the bedrock of its output is likely to come from current affairs discussions. Morgan will reportedly be paid £50m over three years to host the daily talkshow, which will be streamed on Fox Nation in the US and also air on Sky News Australia. Speaking after hiring Morgan in September, Murdoch said: “Piers is the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire. Piers is a brilliant presenter, a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling.” It comes as Morgan announced he will also be returning to ITV for the first time in more than a year, as a guest on the Lorraine show on Saturday. Last year he left ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain after an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s interview with Oprah Winfrey.",News/US news,Donald Trump appears to storm out of Piers Morgan TV interview in advert,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/donald-trump-appears-to-storm-out-of-piers-morgan-tv-interview-in-advert

John M Phillips, an attorney for Manigault Newman, tweeted pictures of the ruling by a court arbitrator, Andrew Brown. The total due to be paid by the Trump campaign was $1,310,873.48. Phillips wrote: “$1.3m attorney fee and cost order against the Trump campaign issued! (Highest known prevailing party attorney fee assessment against a president or presidential campaign).

Fired from that role, in 2018 she published a tell-all memoir, Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House. The book contained explosive claims including that the then president was a “racist” who used the N-word repeatedly. In its review, the Guardian said that though the book was “light on policy”, it had “all the ingredients of a great novel; power, sex, race and money”. Manigault Newman also released audio recordings of Trump officials. Trump sued her for violating a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. He lost the case in September 2021. The New York Times said Phillips provided it a copy of the ruling in which the arbitrator, Brown, wrote that Manigault Newman “was defending herself in a claim which was extensively litigated for more than three years, against an opponent who undoubtedly commanded far greater resources”. Trump did not immediately comment. Manigault Newman tweeted: “First year law student vs [the 45th president’s] entire legal team. (David vs Goliath) … Now pardon me as I get back to studying for my contract law final exam.” Trump faces extensive legal woes elsewhere, including investigations of his business affairs and of his attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat by Joe Biden. He has lost other cases over NDAs, including one involving a former campaign worker who said Trump forcibly kissed her. Also on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent in 2016, filed a motion seeking the dismissal of a lawsuit in which Trump accuses her of a racketeering conspiracy in connection with that election.

4/21/2022,"Boris Johnson has cast doubt on the prospects for a negotiated peace in Ukraine, comparing it to holding talks with a “crocodile”, as he flies to India to discuss the conflict with prime minister Narendra Modi. Speaking on a plane en route to India, where he will seek to deepen trade ties, as well as discussing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the prime minister suggested it would now be impossible for Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government to trust Russia in any talks. “I think it’s very hard to see how the Ukrainians can negotiate with [Russian president Vladimir] Putin now, given his manifest lack of good faith, and his strategy, which is evident, which is to try to engulf and capture as much of Ukraine as he can and then perhaps to have some kind of negotiation from a position of strength, or even to launch another assault on Kyiv,” he said. “I really don’t see how the Ukrainians can easily sit down and come to some kind of accommodation,” he added. “How can you negotiate with a crocodile when it’s got your leg in its jaws?” Instead, Johnson said Nato would “keep going with the strategy” of supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself. He suggested president Zelenskiy had what he called a “pretty maximalist position” of wanting to see Russian troops expelled from their current positions in Donetsk and Luhansk, adding, “on Crimea they’re not so maximalist”. Johnson played down the prospects that he could persuade Modi to toughen India’s stance on Ukraine – though he said he would press the importance of ditching what he called “Putin’s hydrocarbons”. India, which buys military equipment from Russia, abstained on a UN motion condemning Putin’s actions in Ukraine in early March. “I’ve already talked to Narendra Modi about Ukraine and actually the Indians have condemned what happened in Bucha, they have been quite forceful in what they have said,” the prime minister said. “But the UK in particular has to recognise that there is a historic relationship that India has with Russia, I think we have to be alive to that.” As he embarked on a trip that will take in Gujarat and New Delhi, Downing Street announced £1bn of bilateral investments, claiming these would create up to 11,000 jobs in the UK. However, the investment includes a string of small-scale projects, the smallest of which, from Qure AI Technologies, will create just 15 jobs. The largest, from electric bus firm Switch Mobility, will create 4,000 jobs “across the UK and India”. Number 10 also highlighted an agreement that will allow OneWeb, the taxpayer-backed space company, to launch its satellites from India. He said: “As I arrive in India today, I see vast possibilities for what our two great nations can achieve together. From next-generation 5G telecoms and AI to new partnerships in health research and renewable energy – the UK and India are leading the world.” The government laid out plans for an “Indo-Pacific tilt” in the UK’s foreign policy in its strategic defence review last year; but the approach has been questioned since Russia launched its devastating invasion in Europe. But Johnson insisted: “I’m completely clear about this: it’s a good thing for us to be doing. India is our great partner,.” Speaking before the trip, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “We see our role in India as not to seek to lecture and point fingers from the sidelines, but to engage with them constructively as we have done in recent years – to talk to them about potential possible alternatives, on things like energy, on things like security and defence, so we can broaden the coalition of partners who are moving away from any remaining dependence on Russia.” Amid the continuing Partygate scandal, Number 10 is keen to demonstrate that the prime minister is focused on bread and butter issues, including advancing the UK’s economic and security interests abroad. He will visit business and cultural sites during the two-day tour, as well as holding bilateral talks with Modi. The two nations are aiming to agree a free trade agreement by the end of 2022, with two rounds of talks already having taken place and another happening next week. In the past, hopes of a trade deal have foundered on India’s desire for a more liberal visa regime to allow its citizens to enter the UK. On, the plane, Johnson dropped a heavy hint that he might be willing to compromise. “On immigration I’ve always been in favour of having people coming to this country. We have a massive shortage in the UK, not least in experts in IT and programmers. We’re short to the tune of hundreds of thousands in our economy,” he said, adding, “we need to have a professional approach but it has to be controlled.” Johnson is under pressure to secure post-Brexit free trade agreements, after hopes of a swift deal with the US evaporated, with Joe Biden’s focus elsewhere. OneWeb, which was rescued by the UK taxpayer with the enthusiastic backing of Johnson’s former adviser Dominic Cummings, had turned to Elon Musk’s SpaceX for help, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ruled out its previous launch site in Kazakhstan.

The electric car manufacturer reported $18.8bn in revenue for Q1 of 2022, up 81% from a year earlier. The report beat analyst expectations of $17.8bn, sending Tesla shares up 4% in after hours trading. The company acknowledged in a statement that challenges including a large increase in prices for some of its raw materials coupled with supply chain issues have “remained persistent”. “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,” Tesla said in a statement. Those issues have been exacerbated by Covid-19 outbreaks, chip shortages, and the crisis in Ukraine. Tesla has in response raised prices of its products in China, the US, and other countries. Wednesday’s report came as Musk took the market on a rollercoaster by revealing this month that he had quietly become a major shareholder in Twitter and then offering to buy the company outright. There are concerns that Musk may sell some Tesla stocks or borrow against additional Tesla shares to finance his $43 bid to buy Twitter. The results also come amid several legal challenges for the founder and his company. On Wednesday, Musk requested a federal judge allow him to speak freely about a lawsuit accusing him of deceiving Tesla shareholders, which was settled this week. The settlement included a gag order that Musk and his attorneys called unconstitutional. Tesla is also facing multiple discrimination lawsuits. Investors will be watching to see Musk’s outside interests, including his bid for Twitter, affect the entrepreneur’s ability to successfully run Tesla, said Alyssa Altman, analyst at the consultancy firm Publicis Sapient. “It is critical that he continues to instill confidence that he has his hands on the wheel and is driving the complex business of Tesla in the right direction,” she said.

4/21/2022,"Wisden has suggested that the senior executives of the England and Wales Cricket Board who are due to share a £2.1m bonus pot should return or refuse to accept the money after an “annus horribilis” for English cricket. Cricket’s annually published reference book says in its latest edition that the “ethics of the bonus scandal were as bad as the optics” amid job losses and a variety of sporting and administrative failures. Elsewhere the English domestic game is labelled “tone-deaf” on racism, the nation’s attempt to win the Ashes is described as “hapless”, the players involved were “knackered”, and public optimism about the team’s prospects was “completely delusional”. But the 159th edition of the Almanack, published on Thursday, will not be miserable reading for everyone involved in English cricket. There is some praise for the inaugural Hundred, said to have “changed the face of women’s cricket in England”, while despite the failures of the men’s Test team one of their players is named the leading cricketer in the world for the third successive year, with Joe Root following Ben Stokes, who received the accolade in both 2020 and 2021. The Almanack’s 1,536 pages will be difficult reading for many at the ECB and beyond. “Can there ever have been a bigger gap between what English cricket hoped to be and what it was – between reality and fantasy?” Lawrence Booth, the Wisden editor, writes. “Early in 2022, a long-planned assault on the Ashes ended with all-out surrender. Before that, a racism scandal brought to light by the courage of Azeem Rafiq made the game look unwelcoming, and worse. There was little to cherish.” The most savage criticism, however, is reserved for Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief, and the other executives whose £2.1m bonus pot was exclusively revealed by the Guardian last year. “As the annus horribilis took shape, this felt more and more wrong,” Booth writes. “Harrison, remember, had presided over 62 job losses; he had used procedural excuses to defend his failure to intervene [in the racism scandal] at Yorkshire; and, the Ashes up in smoke, he had blamed the domestic structure on the (usefully anonymous) Professional Game Group, and the international calendar on administrators in faraway lands. Of his own shortcomings, he had less to say. “The ethics of the bonus scandal were as bad as the optics. But there was an exit strategy, if only Harrison would recognise it: the bonus should either be returned, allowing the ECB to re-employ some of the staff whose work still had to be done, or used to broaden the game’s diversity. If, by now, he has resigned or refused the money, we applaud. If not, there is still time to undo at least part of the damage.” Ollie Robinson, the English bowler who only nine Tests and 10 months into his international career is named among Wisden’s five cricketers of the year, is also mentioned in the editorial on the racism crisis after his Test debut last June was marked by a tearful apology for historical tweets. “For the ECB, scrambling to be on the right side of history, the timing was horrific,” Booth writes. “As Yorkshire’s mishandling of the Rafiq affair went from bad to abysmal, the scale of the crisis became clear not through solecisms from the past, but clumsy attempts to navigate the present. “Middlesex chairman Mike O’Farrell told the DCMS committee in January that diversification of the dressing-room had been hampered by an Anglo-Caribbean love of football, and Anglo-Asian preference for education. The effect of all these comments was insidious, and the message to those on the game’s margins unambiguous: cricket’s mainstream remained tone-deaf. And if they weren’t paying attention on a subject as important as this, what else had they missed?” Devon Conway, the New Zealand batter who made his Test debut alongside Robinson at Lord’s last June and scored a double century in his first innings, is named among the five cricketers of the year, alongside India’s Jasprit Bumrah and Rohit Sharma and Dane van Niekerk, the South African who led the Oval Invincibles to victory in the first women’s Hundred. Van Niekerk’s compatriot Lizelle Lee, who scored 632 runs at an average of 90 across 11 one-day internationals in 2021, is named the leading female cricketer in the world.",Sport/Sport,Wisden calls on ECB to return £2.1m bonus pot after ‘annus horribilis’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/wisden-calls-on-ecb-to-return-21m-bonus-pot-after-annus-horribilis
4/21/2022,"Boris Johnson has been forced to abandon efforts to block an inquiry into whether he misled MPs over Partygate lockdown breaches, instead urging rebellious MPs to delay any investigation. Government whips scrambled on Wednesday night to derail a Labour motion designed to trigger a Commons inquiry into whether Johnson lied about rule-breaking in Downing Street – including the potential release of hundreds of damaging messages and photographs. Amid a growing backlash from Tory MPs, the government privately conceded it could not whip them to block an inquiry by the Commons privileges committee. It instead tabled a motion to delay the inquiry until after the publication of the final Partygate report by Sue Gray, a senior civil servant. Johnson’s MPs were put on a three-line whip to back the new amendment. The prime minister, who flew to India for a trade visit on Wednesday, will swerve the debate and vote on the motion on Thursday. His allies had earlier briefed that they were prepared to force Tory MPs to vote down the motion from Labour and other opposition parties. But even among frontbenchers there was palpable disquiet that MPs should be forced to block an investigation into the prime minister, who received a police fixed-penalty notice last week. One minister admitted it would be hard to justify Johnson avoiding an investigation for potentially misleading parliament, saying: “If it’s the same process every MP faces, then why should it be different for the PM?” A government spokesperson said: “The government has tabled an amendment to Labour’s motion which says that consideration of this matter should take place after the conclusion of the police investigation and the publication of the Cabinet Office [Sue Gray] report, allowing MPs to have all the facts at their disposal.” A Downing Street source insisted it was not a wrecking amendment but said “now is not the time” to consider the issue. Asked whether the government had been at risk of losing Thursday’s vote, they said “no”. A privileges committee inquiry could be highly damaging even if Johnson is ultimately not formally censured. It would include the right to demand more than 300 photographs believed to have been collated by the original inquiry into rule-breaking by Gray, which have been passed to the Metropolitan police. Sir Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, told the BBC he would “probably” abstain at Thursday’s vote but said he would not vote with Labour. “As much as I am deeply annoyed at what went on in No 10, I am also not in a position where I have much goodwill towards a Labour party who, in my view, failed to advance any form of arguments or raise any of its own concerns about the consequences of a 20-month lockdown.” Thursday’s motion gives four examples of Johnson assuring MPs, including him being “repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken”. The motion also says the inquiry should begin after the conclusion of the Met investigation, with Johnson expected to receive at least three more fines for breaches in the coming weeks. Labour sources said they had drafted the motion to allow the least possible wriggle room for Tory MPs. “This is not our first rodeo,” a senior aide said. “They’re looking for a life raft to try and desperately hold on to.” A former Tory minister insisted they would refuse to vote against the motion unamended, saying: “How can I say he’s completely innocent but there’s no need for an investigation to prove it?” Another MP said he had warned whips there would be at least 30 abstentions unless they devised an off-ramp. A number of Conservative MPs said they had privately urged whips to come up with a solution. “It’s untenable for me to vote to block an investigation if I’m to defend the PM with my constituents,” a backbencher said. Some had urged Johnson to get ahead of Starmer’s ploy by referring himself to the privileges committee to dispel suggestions of another cover up. “If you can’t escape it, you might as well get on the front foot,” said one. Government sources said that option had been rejected. But throughout Wednesday MPs continued to make the argument that Johnson should allow the investigation to take place. A former cabinet minister asked: “How on earth could anyone oppose it?” They said the government should wave the motion through and then “kill it off” in the committee. Labour also moved to blunt arguments from the Tory whips that a Partygate inquiry would be prejudiced because it would be chaired by Labour’s Chris Bryant, a fierce critic of the prime minister. One MP said Johnson had dubbed it “the Bryant committee”. On Wednesday Bryant recused himself from any future inquiry because of his past comments criticising Johnson. The Guardian understands Bryant went to see Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 group, on Wednesday and told him he would recuse himself, prompting relief among backbench Tories that they could vote for the motion. In an open letter to colleagues, Bryant said he believed he would have been able to chair the inquiry fairly but that it was important for the committee to be seen to proceed “without any imputation of unfairness”. Labour sources said Bryant’s recusal had damaged Johnson’s argument that the proposed investigation was entirely politically motivated. The Tory MP Bernard Jenkin is expected to chair any inquiry in Bryant’s absence. Speaking to journalists on the flight to India, Johnson emphasised that he had more important priorities than the inquiry into lockdown breaches. “You’re better off talking about things other than politicians themselves,” he said. “The best thing to do for the people, for parliament, is to get on and focus on the things we were elected to do.” But the Partygate inquiry row inflamed memories of the Owen Paterson sleaze scandal, where furious MPs told Johnson they had been humiliated by attempts to change the parliamentary disciplinary system last year for MPs in order to protect the former cabinet minister from censure. A Labour source said: “It’s clear Tory MPs are done defending the widespread criminality we’ve seen in No 10 … That’s why Tory whips obviously knew that they couldn’t vote this down. They clearly haven’t learnt a thing from the mess they got into over Owen Paterson. Boris Johnson is trying to rig the rules to deflect from his own law-breaking. Any Tory MP who votes for this is voting for a cover-up.”",News/Politics,PM abandons efforts to block inquiry on misleading Commons over Partygate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/boris-johnson-abandons-efforts-block-inquiry-on-misleading-commons-over-partygate
4/21/2022,"Newcastle’s startling metamorphosis continued as Miguel Almirón’s exquisite first-half goal not only elevated Eddie Howe’s renascent side to the security of 40 points but secured a sixth successive home victory. That run equals a record set in 2004 here, back in the days when Tynesiders were “walking in a Robson wonderland” during Sir Bobby’s tenure. Eighteen years on Howe’s team remain a work in progress but, bolstered by Bruno Guimarães’s midfield excellence, are almost unrecognisable from the strugglers Steve Bruce failed to coax a single win out of before his replacement by Howe in November. Yasir al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s chairman, who had flown in from Saudi Arabia, made a congratulatory dressing room visit. It was the first time he had dropped in since offering a pep talk in very different circumstances following an FA Cup defeat by League One Cambridge in January. “Yasir very much enjoyed sharing the moment with the players tonight,” Howe said. “We were excellent, we kept our heads – and what a finish from Almirón. It’s amazing; when we were first here we struggled for one win, let alone six.” Newcastle’s cause was helped by meeting Crystal Palace on an evening when Patrick Vieira’s players were initially well below their best and seemed emotionally drained by their FA Cup semi-final defeat against Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday. “We have a young group of players who have to learn to bounce back after those sort of defeats and we struggled in the first half,” said Vieira. “We didn’t compete well enough.” He and Allan Saint-Maximin did not always see eye-to-eye when they were manager and player at Nice. Evidently anxious to prove a point to a coach he believes under-valued his talent, Saint-Maximin was heavily involved but, perhaps trying too hard to emphasise his work ethic, saw repeated first half dribbling manoeuvres fall apart at the vital moment. If he were still his manager, Vieira would doubtless have told him to keep his head up. Instead Palace’s manager was increasingly preoccupied with his current team’s repeated, rather slapdash, concessions of possession as Newcastle dominated. Few visiting fans could complain when Almirón scored in the 32nd minute. Seconds after being visibly annoyed having been embroiled in a scuffle with the until then anonymous Wilfried Zaha, the usually easy-going Paraguayan forward regained his composure to receive a clever dropping through ball from Guimarães wide on the right. Having used his head to bring it under seamless, highly skilled, control, Almirón shrugged off Tyrick Mitchell before taking a steadying touch and sending a sublime angled left-foot shot swerving into the top corner, evading Vicente Guaita’s outstretched fingertips on its subtly curving route. Talk about channelling your anger. Considering that it prefaced a goal he would have treasured scoring himself, Zaha surely had reason to regret his painful, yet apparently galvanising, pinch of an adversary’s arm. After spending the early part of Howe’s tenure on the sidelines, Almirón is making the best of a very rare first-team run facilitated by Ryan Fraser’s injury and began the second period in similar vein. When Saint-Maximin slalomed beyond a series of defenders and, remembering to look up, played in Guimarães the Brazil international, in turn, cued up the match-winner. On that occasion Almirón’s shot was blocked but Vieira’s expression suggested he would have relished throwing off his managerial anorak, jogging on to the pitch and turning back time by seizing control of central midfield, putting Guimarães in his place along the way. With Joelinton having failed to make the most of a glorious headed chance after connecting with Matt Targett’s free‑kick, Palace’s manager decided change was imperative and had duly made three substitutes by the hour. James McArthur’s 60th-minute introduction changed the game by finally making things extremely tough for Newcastle’s midfield. Finally Palace – and Zaha – finally woke up. If Howe looked somewhat relieved to see Zaha shoot wide after dodging three markers, he had reason to be grateful to Dan Burn in the wake of the centre‑half’s fine interception to deny a goal for Jean-Philippe Mateta. Yet despite Martin Dubravka needing to save the suddenly lively Odsonne Édouard’s header and Zaha curling inches wide in stoppage time, Almirón had already done enough to ensure Rumayyan would be smiling as he stepped into the dressing room.",Sport/Football,Almirón stunner sinks Crystal Palace and takes Newcastle to 40-point mark,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/newcastle-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
4/21/2022,"Manchester City are leaders again after showing the relentlessness required to wrest the top spot back from Liverpool, who had 24 hours at the summit after beating Manchester United. The title race is now a six‑match shootout. City had diced with squeaky posterior time by not scoring until the 53rd minute. But then Riyad Mahrez bundled home and the champions were on their way. Before that nerves had jangled, fans counting each failed attack against a clock that was ticking towards two dropped points, at least. Not now. And if City beat Watford here on Saturday Liverpool will have to stew overnight on a four-point deficit before their Merseyside derby with Everton at Anfield. This was Pep Guardiola’s 250th City victory in 344 games in all competitions: the quickest in top‑flight history. But the manager’s focus is solely on what is ahead. “We have to win all the games to be champions,” he said. “It’s not necessary to tell that to the players, they feel it. We’re competing with one of the best teams ever in Liverpool. [Our chances] depend on fatigue and injuries.” Nathan Aké and John Stones are new fitness concerns, joining Kyle Walker. “Aké twisted his ankle, John felt something muscular. It was important for Ruben [Dias] to get minutes,” Guardiola said of the Portuguese, who replaced Aké at half-time. After being an unused substitute in the FA Cup semi-final defeat against Liverpool on Saturday, Kevin De Bruyne started against visitors who arrived in fine form after consecutive wins against Arsenal and Tottenham. Graham Potter could be proud of these results: they took his side 15 points clear of the drop zone and made them all but mathematically safe. He would feel only chagrin, however, when a Robert Sánchez chip went across the No 1’s goal straight to a lurking Mahrez as City pressed in numbers. The Algerian drew his foot back to shoot but a Moisés Caicedo slide tackle expertly took the ball and not the man in a situation in which it would have been easy to give away a penalty. Brighton, as so many do, hoped to hit City on the break. And they did when Solly March killed a high delivery, tussled with João Cancelo and found Pascal Gross in the inside left channel. When the latter crossed, City were in disarray for a moment. But Stones recovered and his team engineered their own counter, one that, though it foundered when the excellent De Bruyne tapped to Mahrez in the area, was a warning to Brighton of how lethal City are from any position. This was underlined when Bernardo Silva received from De Bruyne and tried a clever lob which was tipped away by Sánchez. City were cruising along in third gear but had no opener to show for their dominance. Balls punted into Brighton’s area by Silva and Cancelo were overhit and Guardiola might have started to think about a half‑time team talk focusing on the need for ruthlessness. De Bruyne had run the match thus far and a simple stab of the ball from him into Brighton’s area allowed Ilkay Gündogan to hit the ball goalwards. Lewis Dunk’s block saved his team, and so as the second half began Liverpool remained leaders. The longer Brighton’s resistance held the more City might tense up. The crowd sensed the same. Three corners came and went, one of them volleyed wide by Rodri and another returned to De Bruyne who booted the ball straight out. But suddenly, a surge of relief. De Bruyne – who else? – made a swashbuckling run that drove those in yellow back. The ball came to Mahrez, who finished with the help of a deflection, and City celebrated. Guardiola was now in arm-waving mode, semaphoring Silva and Foden to pull wide and hectoring Aymeric Laporte. Soon, Foden’s speculative hit bounced off Enock Mwepu and past Sánchez to double the lead, and City could relax. From that point this was an exercise in control for City, and it came with a sweet third. The flick from De Bruyne that created Silva’s goal was as sublime as the finish from the Portuguese forward was emphatic. Manchester City had refused to blink. Whether they or Liverpool do first in the coming weeks will be defining.",Sport/Football,Mahrez breaks tension as Manchester City beat Brighton and return to summit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/manchester-city-brighton-premier-league-match-report
4/21/2022,"Times are changing at Stamford Bridge. Even Arsenal, who once dreaded a trip to this corner of west London, have lost the fear. There is nobody of Didier Drogba’s ilk to bully their defenders into submission these days and, as a measure of how readily Mikel Arteta’s players accepted the challenge of breathing life back into their Champions League challenge, nothing summed it up more than Bukayo Saka converting the penalty that finally dashed Chelsea’s hopes of stealing a point. It was a moment of huge significance for Saka, who had not taken a spot-kick since missing the decisive one when England lost to Italy in the Euro 2020 final. There were no nerves from Arsenal’s brilliant young winger. Saka was full of belief after tormenting Chelsea’s faltering defence and his steel under pressure meant that Arsenal, who had a point to prove after three successive defeats, could celebrate going level with fourth-placed Tottenham with six games left. The race for fourth is alive. Out of nowhere, Arsenal have momentum again. They have another opportunity to kick on when they host Manchester United on Saturday and, for all that their youthful inexperience threatens to hold them back, there is every chance they will come to look back on this victory over Chelsea as a defining moment in their development. This was a vibrant performance, made all the more impressive by the fact Arsenal did it without Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney. There was an excellent display in attack from Eddie Nketiah, who grabbed his first league strikes of the season. Emile Smith Rowe took his goal beautifully. Saka never stopped running and Granit Xhaka was strong alongside Mohamed Elneny in central midfield, where Chelsea’s lack of urgency left them open to Arsenal’s counterattacks. Chelsea, who have conceded 11 in their last three home games, could have no complaints. For the second time in four matches Thomas Tuchel withdrew Andreas Christensen at half-time but the change had no effect. Chelsea, who are only five points above Spurs, were far too unfocused and it spoke volumes that Tuchel was reduced to criticising the pitch when he analysed the error from Christensen that led to Nketiah opening the scoring. All is not well at Chelsea. They had to endure Arsenal’s fans laughing at the 10,000 empty seats in the home areas and the night ended with César Azpilicueta, Tuchel’s captain, remonstrating with one of his own supporters. Tempers were frayed. The home crowd would also vent their frustration at Romelu Lukaku when the £97.5m striker was replaced after 60 sluggish minutes. There were a few boos for Lukaku and it is difficult to see much of a future for him at Chelsea. Arsenal’s prospects looked brighter. They wore black armbands in remembrance of their former chief scout Steve Rowley who passed away at the age of 63, and were ahead after 13 minutes. The goal summed up Chelsea’s difficulties after resting Thiago Silva and starting Malang Sarr in place of the injured Antonio Rüdiger. A punt from Nuno Tavares had Christensen running towards his own goal and flailing under pressure from Nketiah, who was eager to impress after starting instead of Alexandre Lacazette. Christensen, who is expected to join Barcelona on a free, was all over the place. The centre-back’s backpass was underhit and Nketiah, who is out of contract at the end of the season, ran on to beat Édouard Mendy with a cool finish. Arsenal soon proceeded to hand out a few gifts of their own. Ruben Loftus-Cheek quickly won possession high up the pitch and Timo Werner equalised after letting fly with a shot that spun past Aaron Ramsdale thanks to a heavy deflection off Xhaka. Yet the equaliser did not alter the pattern of the game. There was danger every time Saka ran at Sarr and Marcos Alonso on the right, and Chelsea were soon behind again. Xhaka rescued Rob Holding from a mess of his own making before calmly bringing the ball out from the back, Saka and Martin Ødegaard combined well and Smith Rowe fired past Mendy. Back came Chelsea, though, equalising again on 32 minutes. This time Ben White was at fault when he gave the ball away to Mason Mount and appealed for a free-kick. Jon Moss was not interested in White’s complaints and Mount crossed for Azpilicueta to peel past Tavares and prod the ball beyond Ramsdale. Yet Chelsea were still a mess. After 57 minutes Azpilicueta misplaced a pass and Tavares attacked. The left wing-back found Nketiah and, when Silva, Sarr and N’Golo Kanté failed to clear, the striker prodded the ball past Mendy. It was another self-inflicted wound. Tuchel tried to respond, replacing Lukaku with Kai Havertz, but there was no way back. Arsenal pushed on the break and the points were theirs when Azpilicueta conceded a penalty for fouling Saka, who finished confidently. Arsenal sensed a power shift.",Sport/Football,Eddie Nketiah double hands Arsenal vital win amid Chelsea chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
4/21/2022,"The verdict on whether Richarlison made a crucial or costly contribution against Leicester may not be returned until Everton’s final league position is decided but, having stared at a damaging defeat from the fifth minute to the 92nd, Frank Lampard understandably took the optimistic view. Richarlison could have had a hat‑trick in a game where Leicester’s superiority in possession failed to translate into clearcut opportunity beyond Harvey Barnes’s early goal. The Brazil international had to settle for a scuffed stoppage-time equaliser instead, bringing relief to a tense Goodison Park with the 50th goal of his Everton career. Chances were going begging, hope was fading and Burnley were looking at the possibility of dragging Everton into the relegation zone when the substitutes Salomon Rondón and Dele Alli combined to set up Richarlison’s strike. The first draw of his Everton reign drew no complaints from Lampard. “A late goal that gets you a draw like that feels like a real positive,” the Everton manager said. “It was a difficult game but we deserved it; not on possession but on chances. We were too open and allowed Leicester to play in the first half. The second half was different. We fought for it. “The spirit is there and the players showed it. This is not the time for pretty patterns or philosophy. We have to show fight and character to stay in this league and we showed that tonight.” Leicester started with a freedom and confidence that Everton’s predicament does not allow, although were ultimately left to lament dropping more points from a winning position. The early lead helped, of course, along with the seven changes that Brendan Rodgers made from the stoppage-time defeat at Newcastle on Sunday. The Leicester manager replaced his entire back four and recalled James Maddison, Barnes and Kelechi Iheanacho. Lampard was forced into his attacking switch. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was ruled out of the game, plus the Merseyside derby at Anfield on Sunday, having felt “a small sensation in his quad in training”, according to the Everton manager. The squad has been plagued by recurring injuries this season and the trials of Calvert‑Lewin, who was still searching for sharpness following a quadriceps problem that had sidelined him for four months, have been a major factor in Everton’s decline. The visitors immediately served notice of their ability to pierce Everton’s defence. Merely 25 seconds had elapsed when Ricardo Pereira’s threaded pass sent the impressive Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall clean through on goal. Séamus Coleman recovered with a vital challenge to spare his team from the worst possible start, injuring his thigh in the process, but the worst was only delayed. Leicester cut through again with ease from their next attack. Kasper Schmeichel picked out Pereira in space on the right with a precise clearance. The right‑back exchanged passes with Youri Tielemans before releasing Maddison, who considered his options on the right and centred for Iheanacho. The striker’s shot deflected off the lunging Yerry Mina, who was making his first start since 8 February, and fell to Barnes, who steered his first goal in 10 games through the legs of Coleman and in off the far post. Everton were passive in the face of Leicester’s comfortable passing game in the first half and too deep to apply serious pressure on the visiting defence. From their first meaningful attack, however, Lampard’s team should have equalised. Anthony Gordon escaped down the left and crossed hard and low across the Leicester six-yard box. Richarlison, unmarked at the back post, prodded badly wide with only Schmeichel to beat. The Brazilian missed another glorious chance in the 83rd minute when heading Gordon’s corner wide from six yards out. But he made amends when his team needed it most. The introduction of Rondón and Alli improved Everton as an attacking threat and ensured Richarlison was no longer isolated. Coleman had just missed another clear opening for the hosts when Alli broke down the right and crossed low towards Rondón. The ball rolled under the forward’s feet to Richarlison, whose scuffed shot struck Pereira and sailed into the far corner. Goodison erupted. Rodgers, visibly irritated by his team’s failure to finish off one of several excellent counterattacks in the second half, was deflated. “Performance-wise we were excellent,” the Leicester manager said. “But we needed a wee bit more composure in the final third to close the game out. We were in some great positions and it was just demanding more quality. “This is our fourth game since Everton had that great result against Manchester United. This is a young team and I am delighted with how they played.”",Sport/Football,Richarlison denies Leicester to earn late relief for Everton in survival bid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/everton-leicester-premier-league-match-report
4/21/2022,"Good morning. The first leaders’ debate marked a turning point in this year’s election campaign, with the rivalry between the two major parties set to increase in the coming weeks. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese clashed over the NDIS, refugee boat turnbacks and China’s security agreement with Solomon Islands in the debate. The pair traded barbs over over the China-Solomon Islands deal, with Anthony Albanese labelling it a “Pacific stuff-up” and Scott Morrison accusing him of siding with China. During the debate, which the Labor leader won by swaying 40% of the audience over the prime minister’s 35%, Morrison focused on the handling of the economy while Albanese accused the government of “not pursuing any significant economic, social or environmental reforms”. In other election news, locals in the Sydney seat of Wentworth say the Coalition under Morrison is deeply unpopular and there’s only one hot topic up for discussion: “It’s all about bloody climate change,” one says. Australia’s coal export boom will come to an abrupt end because of an “imminent and substantial” drop in purchases by China, and coalmining communities should brace for the change, according to Jorrit Gosens, the lead author of a new study. Gosens said while both major party leaders were telling voters Australia’s coal exports had decades to run, the peer-reviewed paper forecast Chinese imports would fall in the next two the three years. “We do hope with this [study] that folks in coal mining regions, industries and governments also look at those results and figure out that they need to be a little bit more hasty with their plans to reduce their dependency on the coal mining industry,” he said. Vladimir Putin said Russia had successfully conducted a test launch of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new addition to its nuclear arsenal. Putin said it would provide rivals with “food for thought”. Russia’s nuclear forces will start taking deliveries of the missile this year, once testing is complete. About 6,000 civilians trapped in Mariupol have been able to leave but officials said there were far fewer than hoped, as an ultimatum by Russia to Ukrainian fighters holding out in the city to surrender passed its deadline. The Australian War Memorial is pursuing a new sponsorship deal with the arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin despite criticism from veterans, historians and retired staff that the deal would be “degrading to the memory of our war dead”. Victoria and New South Wales will ease Covid restrictions for close contacts from Friday, a move that has been welcomed by business leaders, but split epidemiologists, some of whom are concerned it sends the wrong message at a time when daily infections remain high. The Australian Rail Track Corporation’s has proposed 200 drainage control areas over parts of the inland rail, after years of flood concerns raised by locals and experts. The aged care sector has questioned the Coalition’s claims that the home care workforce has grown 13% since November, saying the figures appear at odds with the “severe staffing challenges” it is experiencing. The Morrison government’s promise to spend $7.4bn on building a series of new dams is probably “the biggest pork barrel in history”, says the author of new research that claims other investment would deliver significantly better economic outcomes and more jobs. A UK court has formally approved the extradition of WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange to the US on espionage charges, in what will ultimately be a decision for the UK home secretary, Priti Patel.

Producers of the movie Rust have been handed the maximum fine for safety lapses before what authorities called the “avoidable” shooting death of the film’s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins.

The art style was born when the family, who were traditionally roving musicians and singers of devotional songs and stories, were asked by the anthropologist Haku Shah to write down the songs to preserve the cultural tradition. The head of the family, Ganesh, could not write, so Shah suggested he draw the stories instead.

4/21/2022,"The actor Juliet Stevenson has made an 11th-hour plea to Conservative MPs voting on the government’s controversial immigration bill on Wednesday to “be brave and vote with your heart, not with your party membership card”. Stevenson has urged MPs who are backing the nationality and borders bill to instead back Lords amendments in support of refugees. However, on Wednesday night MPs backed plans to offshore asylum seekers and introduce a two-tier refugee system. Eleven Conservatives voted against the government and backed giving asylum seekers the right to work including Father of the House Sir Peter Bottomley, William Wragg, vice-chair of the 1922 committee, Steve Baker and former cabinet ministers Robert Buckland, David Davis and Andrew Mitchell. Mariam Kemple Hardy, head of campaigns at Refugee Action, said: “These plans will heap further misery on refugees and will do nothing to stop Channel crossings or break up people-smuggling gangs. “We need a refugee system that provides protection, not punishment. That means creating more routes for people to reach safety in the UK and an effective and fast asylum system built on compassion and justice.” The government now faces a third defeat in the Lords next week before the bill returns once again to the Commons Earlier on Wednesday, Stevenson was one of a group of celebrities and refugees who boarded a boat on the Thames decorated with blue and yellow bunting in solidarity with Ukraine, orange hearts in support of refugees and a large blue and yellow banner saying: “Vote to protect not punish refugees.” Refugees from Ukraine and other conflict zones were joined by celebrities including Stevenson, Robert Rinder, the model Lily Cole, author Kathy Lette and comedian Deborah Frances-White. The boat sailed around a stretch of the Thames that is overlooked by the Houses of Parliament in the hope of catching the eye of MPs and persuading them to not support the bill. Stevenson, who is hosting a Ukrainian refugee named Dartsa and her six-year-old daughter, Orysia, both of whom joined her onboard, is a longstanding advocate for refugee rights. She said that while government was on a “downward trajectory” in terms of attitudes to refugees, the public was clearly headed in the opposite direction. “The nationality and borders bill is the most brutal piece of legislation to have ever gone through parliament,” she said. Stevenson, Dartsa and Orysia say the two families are getting along well and have bonded with the family dog, Millie. Stevenson said doing something practical like hosting was helping with “processing the horror” of what was happening in Ukraine. Dartsa said: “It was a great relief to come to the UK with my little girl and know that we are safe from the terrible war in our country. Of course, it is not easy and I worry all the time for all those back home. But my family back there and I are so grateful to Juliet and her family for opening their door to us. I can only hope that nobody has to experience what we are now, but this welcome is a huge comfort at such an awful time.” Rinder, whose grandfather was a Holocaust survivor, said that protecting and welcoming refugees was “an absolutely fundamental part of British values”. “We need to have a humane, sensible and fair policy towards refugees,” he said. Wednesday’s event was organised by Together With Refugees, a coalition of more than 400 organisations across the country, who support refugees fleeing war and persecution. The coalition is calling for a better approach to supporting refugees that allows people to seek safety in the UK, no matter how they came here and ensures people can live in dignity while they wait to find out if they will be granted asylum. Together With Refugees had called on MPs to vote to accept amendments to the bill, including scrapping the proposal to punish refugees who arrive in the UK on a boat across the Channel or in the back of a lorry. MPs are also being urged to agree that the government must publish an annual target for the number of refugees it will resettle in the UK. Campaigners would want this target to be at least 10,000 refugees from around the world each year.",News/World news,Tory MPs ignore celebrity entreaties and back immigration bill,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/vote-with-your-heart-juliet-stevenson-joins-protest-against-uk-immigration-bill
4/21/2022,"The double life of British boxing continued in typically surreal and jolting fashion on Wednesday afternoon at Wembley Stadium. A strictly controlled and initially respectful press conference to publicise Tyson Fury’s world heavyweight title defence against Dillian Whyte on Saturday night began less than an hour after the controversial boxing management company MTK Global confirmed it will cease operations at the end of this month. MTK had been founded in 2012, under the original name of MGM, by the notorious Daniel Kinahan who has been under investigation for years amid allegations that he leads a drugs cartel. Last week the US Treasury imposed stringent sanctions on Kinahan and offered a $5m reward for information that would result in his arrest and conviction on a long list of serious criminal charges. The US government also warned that anyone in boxing who retained ties with Kinahan would be implicated. Fury and hundreds of boxers in Britain are known to have had close working relationships with Kinahan in recent years. Many of these fighters have traded under the MTK banner. Once the gravity of the US government response to Kinahan emerged the already deeply scarred boxing landscape began to crumble. The demise of MTK is no surprise as its statement on Wednesday afternoon confirmed: “Since leading promoters have now informed us that they will be severing all ties with MTK and will no longer work with our fighters, we have taken the difficult decision to cease operations at the end of this month … our priority in the weeks ahead will be to ensure that our world-class boxers are supported to find new partnerships.” Thirty-six hours earlier Bob Yalen, MTK’s chief executive, had announced his resignation. Yalen, who had worked with the company since 2018, said: “The pressure of the last few weeks has been particularly intense. I need to consider the impact on myself and my family.” Yalen is an American and he had been shaken by the intervention of the US government and their law-enforcement agencies. Meanwhile Fury had stressed to the media, during an open workout on Tuesday afternoon: “It’s none of my business … it’s got nowt to do with me.” When pressed to discuss MTK, with the company yet to announce its imminent closure, Fury also denied that he retained any links with the organisation. “I have never been sponsored by MTK ever,” he said. When reminded that he used to be part of the MTK stable and had worn their logo, he responded bluntly. “That was from 2017 until 2020. Three years and that was it. Done. End of.” There was no mention of MTK’s collapse at his press conference with Whyte. Instead, the heavyweights praised each other and spoke relatively fondly and amusingly of how they had worked together at three of Fury’s training camps – starting in 2012. “He’s a good fighter,” Fury said. “A good, strong, solid man. He has a good punch with good power. He’s knocked out lots of men. He definitely needs a lot of respect.” It was only at the end of the media conference that a more usual sense of heavyweight chaos returned when John Fury, Tyson’s belligerent father, started shouting and threatening Dean Whyte, the challenger’s brother. The two real fighters, Fury and Whyte, stepped in to act as peacemakers. “Tyson’s dad needs to relax,” Whyte said afterwards. “I told him: ‘John calm down, you’re an adult. You keep shouting and screaming like a child, relax. This is my and your son’s day. Old man, take it easy.’” Twenty minutes later Whyte was less relaxed as, on the Wembley pitch, he became involved in an extremely tense exchange with Mauricio Sulaimán, president of the WBC. Whyte believes the WBC has favoured Fury unfairly as its champion and broken its own rules. He will receive only 20% of the fight purse, which is a record $41,025,000 (£31m), and Whyte insists he will eventually win his dispute with the WBC and Fury’s team at the court of arbitration for sport. Sulaimán defended Kinahan robustly this month – only to make a complete U-turn this week as he absorbed the shock of the US sanctions against the exiled Irishman who is based in Dubai and continues to deny all wrongdoing. Fury met a small group of British boxing writers after the official press conference, where no journalists had been allowed to ask any questions. He was invited to comment on MTK but his promoter, Frank Warren, intervened swiftly to say that all related queries had been “dealt with yesterday”. There was no such respite for MTK Global. “As a business we have faced unprecedented levels of unfair scrutiny and criticism since the sanctioning by the US government of Daniel Joseph Kinahan,” its statement claimed. “It is a matter of public record that Mr Kinahan’s involvement in MTK ceased in 2017, and, despite repeated reassurances in this regard, unfounded allegations about his ongoing association with us and our fighters persist.” Yet in May 2020 Sandra Vaughan, who was Yalen’s predecessor, said in an interview that Kinahan advised fighters to sign management deals with MTK and operated as an independent adviser to some of their boxers. MTK also released a statement in 2020 that delighted in a new partnership between Kinahan and the Dubai-based KHK Sports, which had appointed him as its special adviser: “This is a monumental move for KHK Sports and MTK Global. Both organisations have been making substantial waves in the international combats sports landscape and, combined, the sky is the limit in what they can achieve.” The sky has now fallen in on MTK and other boxing companies and individuals might suffer a similar fate in the coming weeks. In the meantime, as the net tightens around Kinahan and his associates, the small matter of a world championship scrap between Fury and Whyte will break out at Wembley late on Saturday night. “We’re going to treat you all to a hell of a barnstormer,” Fury promised.",Sport/Sport,"MTK Global, boxing company founded by suspected crime boss Kinahan, folds",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/boxing-company-mtk-founded-by-suspected-crime-boss-daniel-kinahan-folds
4/21/2022,"It was billed as a match between two presidential candidates – one who inspired fear and the other loathing. In the much-anticipated debate on Wednesday night, Marine Le Pen set out to show the French should not be afraid to give her a chance to run the country, while Emmanuel Macron was determined to fix his image of the man the French love to hate. Above all, both were anxious to show they understood the daily lives and worries of their compatriots over a range of subjects including the effects of the war in Ukraine, healthcare, pensions, Covid, Europe, taxes, immigration, ecology and the cost of living. The two-and-a-half hour exchange, screened on television, radio and online from 9pm local time, began civilly with a smiling Le Pen saying she would be the president of “respect and common sense”. Le Pen had drawn lots to speak first and opened by addressing the cost of living crisis, which polls show is the number one concern for French voters. She spoke of reducing taxes permanently to give French families between €150 to €200 (£125 to £166) extra each month per household. “An absolute priority for the next year will be giving back the French their money,” she said promising to reduce VAT on fuel and energy. Macron, looking more serious, said his approach to “people’s anger about struggling to make ends meet” was to freeze prices during the cost of living crisis as an emergency measure. “This is more efficient than a drop in VAT,” he added. “And you voted against it.” “I want something lasting, like leaving the European electricity market, not something temporary,” Le Pen said in response. The first real clash came over salaries, when Macron dismissed Le Pen’s suggestion she would increase wages by 10%. “The president doesn’t decide salaries, that’s down to employers,” Macron said. “You are trying to make people believe you will increase salaries by 10% and it’s not true.” “And you are trying to make people believe you will increase bonuses,” Le Pen hit back. The face-off was a challenge for both. Le Pen could not stop herself smirking and appearing to mock Macron as he spoke, and Macron could not shake his habit of explaining policies in detail in headteacher fashion. Macron is an experienced and sharp debater, which Le Pen is not. While he struggled to correct her “incoherent” proposals with facts without sounding patronising, she relied on soundbites and emotive expressions of “astonishing”, “shocking”, “unacceptable”, jumping from one subject to another and floundering on details. There were the expected hot topics: Macron mentioned Russia, claiming that Le Pen’s well-publicised loan from a Russian bank with links to the Kremlin made her “dependent” and influenced her political decisions. “You cannot defend the interests of France because your interests are linked to Russian powers,” Macron said. “In 2015 you took out a loan with a Russian bank and you still have not paid it back.” This prompted Le Pen, a cat breeder in her spare time, to show her claws. “He knows I am a free woman, I am a patriot. I have always defended France and the French. Always and in all circumstances,” she said. The exchange was equally fractions over France’s future relationship with the European Union. Le Pen has said she wants to say in the EU but create an alliance of European nations, which would sideline the European Commission. Macron said this was the equivalent of Frexit by stealth. Le Pen said: “You have a narrow vision of France as a continental power, but it should once again become a global power.” The debate, while animated, became increasingly tetchy and combative. When Macron called Le Pen “climate sceptic”, she batted back calling him a “climate hypocrite”. “Stop confusing everything, Madame Le Pen,” he said. “Stop giving lessons Mr Macron,” she retorted. With everything to win or lose, Macron, 44, had to avoid sounding arrogant and headmasterly and Le Pen, 53, had to appear calm, credible and above all moderate to win over the 40% of floating voters who did not support either in the first round 10 days ago, especially the 7.7 million who voted for the radical left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The face-off was moderated by two journalists well known to French audiences, and each candidate had equal time to answer questions on a range of subjects and their policies. The debate is a big event in French presidential elections since it was introduced in 1974. Only Jacques Chirac refused to debate his second-round rival, the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, in 2002, saying to do so would legitimise Le Pen’s extreme views. After a disastrous performance in the 2017 presidential debate, Le Pen was far better prepared this time. She had been advised to play the mother of the nation – advice she failed to take in 2017. Five years on, Macron is no longer the political arriviste and was able to carry his arguments with the weight of presidential experience, albeit with mixed results. Other thorny issues were Le Pen’s plans to ban the Islamic headscarf in public places, exempt the under-30s from income tax and hold a referendum to bypass the constitution to clamp down on immigration and introduce nationalist French-first policies for jobs, benefits and healthcare. Le Pen was more comfortable on her specialist subject, crime and insecurity: she lamented the increased “barbarity” in the country and blamed it on “anarchic and massive immigration”. She promised to “rearm the police” and toughen up the legal system creating 25,000 extra prison places. “I have a lot to say on this issue,” she said when reminded of her time limit. Macron said he had already created thousands of new police and gendarmes and promised to reform the legal and prison systems. Allowed to return to the subject, Le Pen promised to tackle Islamic extremism with a new law and called for a “Republic that is proud of itself and not ashamed”. Radical mosques had to be closed and those migrants considered a security risk deported. “I am for the banning of the headscarf in the public place, it’s a uniform imposed by Islamic extremists,” she added. Macron replied: “What is worrying is that you go from terrorism to Islam and on to foreigners, you are confusing all the problems. In the housing estates, what you saying will cause civil war. It is very serious.” Much of the debate was technical. The question of pensions and the official retirement age is an extremely complicated issue that is difficult to clarify in a television clash. The debate ran 20 minutes over the two-and-a-half hours. It ended on a remarkably civilised note. Macron finished by thanking Le Pen for the debate saying “I respect you as a person...though we have sincere disagreements.” Le Pen chose a more vigorous summing up, promoting her programme for “the French, for all the French”. The latest opinion poll from Ipsos suggests Macron has a 12 point lead over Le Pen for the second-round vote, with him winning with 56% and her on 44%, with a 1.1% margin of error. However, 13% of those voters did not say for whom they would vote. Of those who said they would abstain or vote blank, 43% said they may change their mind on the day.",News/World news,Macron and Le Pen go head-to-head in French presidential debate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/macron-and-le-pen-go-head-to-head-in-french-presidential-debate
4/21/2022,"The double Olympic champion Katie Archibald has sharply criticised the transgender policies of the International Olympic Committee and other sports bodies – saying they have not only let down female cyclists by underplaying biology but left trans women, such as Emily Bridges, facing intense scrutiny. Archibald, who won the second of her cycling gold medals in Tokyo last year alongside Dame Laura Kenny in the Madison, said it was wrong for governing bodies to ignore the science that shows trans women who have gone through male puberty have a retained advantage in strength, stamina and physique. However, she also expressed deep sympathy for Bridges, who broke the junior men’s 25-mile record before transitioning in 2020, saying she was only following the rules of cycling’s governing body, the UCI, before it decided to block her racing as a woman last month. “It is my opinion that the international governing bodies of several sports have let down transgender athletes, in particular transgender women, with their inclusion policies,” Archibald said in a statement. “These policies have put the athletes, their involvement in sport, and their personal lives under intense scrutiny when all the athletes have done is follow the rules and enter a category they were encouraged to enter.” Archibald made it clear that she and other females were also being let down by the unwillingness of sports to accept the importance of biology. “I feel let down by the International Olympic Committee who tell me there should be no assumed advantage for an athlete with a gender identity different to their sex,” she said. “I read this and hear that my world titles, my Olympic medals, and the champions jerseys I have at home, were all won in a category of people who simply don’t try as hard as the men. That losing to male androgenisation is not about biology, but mindset. They are wrong. She added: “The retained advantage of people who have gone through male puberty in strength, stamina and physique, with or without testosterone suppression, has been well documented. “Cycling’s global governing body, by its president’s own admission, knows this. But they chose to delay action until it became sadly personal for one rider. That wasn’t fair.” Bridges, who came out as a transgender woman in October 2020, continued to compete as a male during her transition, and in February won the men’s points race at the British Universities’ championships. She had met British Cycling’s previous requirement – that riders in the female category have had testosterone levels below five nanomoles per litre for a 12-month period prior to competition – in time to register for the omnium at the British championships in Derby, but the UCI did not grant a switch in licence. In her statement Archibald also called on governing bodies of sports such as cycling, triathlon and rowing to come together to develop policies based on science, while also making their sport more welcoming for trans athletes. “But I’d like us to do all this without sacrificing one of the foundational pillars of sport: fairness.”",Sport/Sport,Katie Archibald claims IOC unfair to female cyclists and trans women,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/katie-archibald-claims-ioc-unfair-to-female-cyclists-and-trans-women
4/21/2022,"The UK will “reform” the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol if the EU will not, Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned, raising the possibility of a dramatic intervention after the assembly elections in a fortnight’s time. The Brexit opportunities minister said he could not reveal any more due to the sensitivities of the Stormont election in Northern Ireland, where tensions have flared over the protocol. He told MPs on the EU scrutiny committee that the protocol was written in such a way that it could be “superseded”. “That is really important to understand because a lot of commentary that says: ‘Well, we signed it and therefore surely we should accept it lock, stock and barrel.’ That’s absolute nonsense. “We signed it on the basis that it would be reformed. And there comes a point at which you say: ‘Well, you haven’t reformed it and therefore we are reforming it ourselves.’ And the United Kingdom is much more important than any agreement that we have with any foreign power,” he told MPs. Asked what moves he had in mind in relation to reforms, he said: “I think I oughtn’t say any more with elections going on,” but added that “the wheels are in motion”. “We can do what we want, ultimately,” the Brexit opportunities minister told MPs in relation to clause 38 (b) in the EU Withdrawal Act 2020 which underlines parliamentary powers in domestic law. His comments come amid rife speculation in Northern Ireland industry circles that the government is planning an “internal market bill 2.0” a reference to the controversial 2020 attempt to unilaterally tear up some of the protocol. That move was abandoned after government claims it would only breach the international Brexit treaty in a “specific and limited” way were denounced by opposition parties and some leading Conservative figures. Rees Mogg was being questioned about reforms to EU retained law and the so called Brexit reforms bill. He revealed that not all the 1,500 EU laws the government wanted to remove or change would be in the bill as a “trade off” to getting it ready in time for the Queen’s speech. But he said some changes would be definitely included, such as streamlining of procurement rules which, pre-Brexit, required public bodies to tender across the EU, and to data protection laws. He also hinted that the UK would not be following a new EU move to put speed limiters on cars as some reports have suggested. “It is not a policy that has received collective agreement,” he said. Rees Mogg’s comments on Northern Ireland comes as the EU and UK continue to negotiate a revised version of the protocol with a deal already agreed and approved to remove barriers blocking the sale of British medicines in NI which observes EU trade rules under the protocol. Sources close to the talks say progress is not expected until after the assembly election with hopes a deal could be done on one of the main sticking points – customs paperwork.",News/Politics,"UK will ‘reform’ Northern Ireland protocol if EU will not, says Rees-Mogg",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/brexit-uk-northern-ireland-protocol-jacob-rees-mogg
4/21/2022,"The two finalists in France’s presidential elections faced off in a live TV debate that could be crucial in persuading wavering voters – particularly on the left – four days before the decisive second round vote. Here are some of the highlights of what was, on the whole, a far more civilised exchange than their encounter five years ago: Asked to open the debate by stating what kind of president she would be, Marine Le Pen says she would be “a president of daily life, of the value of work … A president of national fraternity, uniting the national around a collective project. Another choice is possible,” she says. Macron says he has traversed a “difficult time” with the country, a time when “fears, concerns are there”. He aims to continue to do so because “I believe that we can make our country more independent, and stronger”. Cost of living crisis: Le Pen says seven out of 10 people feel their purchasing power has fallen over the past five years. She says she will cut taxes, reward hard work, and help those who are vulnerable. I will “give the French their money back”, she says, to the tune of €150-200 a month per household. Macron says purchasing power has risen under his presidency but admits “life is becoming more expensive”. He says it is more effective to cap prices than to cut taxes, and notes that Le Pen voted against price caps in parliament. He also notes that Le Pen’s promise to raise salaries by 10% is not in her gift: “It is employers who decide that.” Macron adds that his government’s measures have kept inflation significantly lower in France than in its EU neighbours. Foreign policy: Le Pen congratulates Macron on the steps he has taken to help the people of Ukraine “in the name of France” but questions EU sanctions on Russia, which she says “will do enormous harm to the French people”. Macron counterattacks, raising Le Pen’s support for Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the fact that her party has taken out Russian bank loans. “You are dependent on Russian power, and Mr Putin”, Macron says. Le Pen insists, vehemently, that the loans do not mean she is influenced by Moscow: “I am a perfectly free woman,” and reminds Macron that he received the Russian leader in Versailles. On Europe, Macron says: “You still want to leave the EU, you just don’t say it any more.” Le Pen denies this: “I want the European Commission to respect sovereign nations – I want to change the EU, not leave it.” Macron accuses her of disguising her true intentions: much of her programme, he says, would be in breach of EU laws and principles: “You cannot change the rules of a club of 27 members all by yourself, just because you are Marine Le Pen. Your project is a project that would shrink France.” Social policy: On the controversial subject of pensions, Macron suggests progressively extending the retirement age to at 65 by 2031, with exceptions for particularly hard physical jobs. Le Pen calls this “an insufferable injustice”; she says she will place the retirement age at between 60 and 62, with 42 years of contributions required for a full state pension. Macron says her plan is not feasible. Le Pen attacks the president’s “appalling economic record”, dubbing Macron “the Mozart of finance”. She is sceptical about Macron’s claim to have cut unemployment from 9.6% to 7.4%; he defends it with international data. Macron also says he is “pretty proud” of his government’s emergency economic measures to support jobs and businesses during the pandemic and demands to know what Le Pen would have done instead. Environment: Le Pen says a prime cause of the climate crisis is the global free market; she says her “entire project” is built around “localism”. Macron says she is not logical: fossil fuels are a major contributor to global heating, but she is proposing to cut the VAT on petrol and diesel. He accuses Le Pen of being a climate sceptic, observing: “There is not a single ecological proposal in your project.” He criticises her proposal to dismantle windfarms that have already been built and ban future ones. Digital: Le Pen says a European Google “should have been launched years ago”. Macron says France is the country that “produces the most start-ups” in Europe, but adds that Google, Apple and Amazon were born in the US “because of the size of the American market. France’s market has to be all of Europe; anyone who does not like Europe cannot develop digital champions.” Crime: Le Pen says crime and security is “an absolutely essential issue. The situation in the country is really very bad … We are confronted with real barbarism.” She says this is one reason why she will hold a referendum on immigration because “uncontrolled immigration is one of the main contributory causes of crime in this country”. She demands firmness from judges and 25,000 more cells in the country’s prisons. Macron says his government had “kept its promises”, creating 10,000 jobs in the police and increasing the justice budget by 30% in the past two years. Secularism: Asked about her promise to ban the wearing of the hijab in public, Le Pen insists she is not anti-Islam but “opposed to the Islamist ideology”. She says Macron’s policies against Islamism “has not been effective”. The hijab is “a uniform imposed by Islamists” and should be banned in public. Macron says he would never ban signs of religious belief in public because doing so would be contrary to France’s constitution: “You will incite a civil war if you ban the veil,” he said. “It makes no sense. It is confusing all the problems; confusing Islam with Islamism.” He says France, “the home of the Enlightenment”, would be the first country in the world to ban religious signs in public space. Immigration: Le Pen says she will revise the French constitution through a referendum that would introduce a national priority for jobs and benefits, as well as cancelling automatic citizenship rights for children of non-nationals born in France, changing the asylum process and the naturalisation rules. Macron says none of this could be accomplished without the cooperation of third countries. Governance: Macron says referendums can be a good idea but insists that the referendum on citizenship and immigration “is not constitutional”. Le Pen insists her plan is constitutional: “Only the people are sovereign,” she says. “You are proposing to change the constitution without going through parliament,” Macron says. Conclusions: Macron says the debate was “sincere” and the two candidates had “respectful disagreements”. He says the elections on 24 April was “a referendum for or against the EU, for or against the environment, for what we are.” Le Pen addresses “the French people”, praising her project as “viable, and, I believe, vital”.",News/World news,Macron-Le Pen debate: key moments in the French election head-to-head,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/macron-le-pen-debate-key-moments-in-the-french-election-head-to-head
4/21/2022,"Home Office staff have threatened to strike and drawn comparisons to working for the Third Reich over Priti Patel’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, it has emerged. Comments on an internal online noticeboard include calls for industrial action to stop the policy and concern from a staff member of 20 years who feels “deep shame” and is considering their position. One anonymous civil servant drew a comparison to serving under Adolf Hitler. In a reference to the post-second world war Nazi trials at Nuremberg, they wrote: “The words ‘I was only obeying orders’ are echoing down through history to me and making me queasy.” They were later chastised by a colleague for making “absurd comparisons”. It comes as a Conservative MP challenged the government’s plan to build a processing centre for asylum seekers in a small North Yorkshire village. The internal comments, first disclosed by Mail+, reveal that dozens of staff have voiced their opposition to the agreement with Rwanda, which was signed off by the home secretary this week and has been applauded by Boris Johnson. One Home Office staff member asked whether staff would have a duty to campaign against the policy. “Do we have a responsibility to not just leave, but to organise and resist? We cannot simply wash our hands and walk away,” they wrote. Another asked: “I find the government proposal totally unethical and it impacts directly upon my workstream. As a civil servant can I refuse this type of work in contravention of my own ethics?” Another said: “I’ve worked for the Home Office for 20 years. There’s been some ups and downs in that time. But this announcement has made me feel deep shame and is the first time I am considering my position here and whether I need to get out of this department.” Another stated: “Can the permanent secretary and seniors give staff any advice on coping with our conscience with these sort of policies? I don’t feel safe telling people I work for the Home Office any more and now just make up a nondescript role in another government department when asked what I do for a job.” The report has been confirmed as accurate by a Home Office source. The comments will be put to the Home Office permanent secretary, Matthew Rycroft, during an online group call for staff on Thursday. In a further development, the local Tory MP has challenged plans for a new centre at the former RAF base Linton-on-Ouse, announced as part of the government’s new migration measures. Kevin Hollinrake, representing Thirsk and Malton, initially suggested he was sympathetic to the plans. But on Wednesday, after meeting Patel, he called for the proposal to be reversed and threatened to support a judicial review if it is not. “The current proposal of 1,500 young men in an open camp in the heart of a small rural village is not workable, sustainable or acceptable,” wrote Hollinrake in a letter to the home secretary. “It simply cannot be that availability of a site dictates the appropriateness of the location,” he said. Some Conservative MPs raised concerns over the Rwanda policy on Wednesday as they debated the government motion to disagree with Lords’ amendments to the nationality and borders bill. Simon Hoare, the MP for North Dorset, said: “A safe route clearly would kill the evil traffic of people-smuggling at a stroke. That’s one way of dealing with it. “I fail to see how moving people to Rwanda is going to in any way disrupt this money-making scheme which these people traffickers have. They’re just going to use different routes to land people on our shores. I’m just not getting it, I’m afraid.” The Conservative former minister Sir Bob Neill suggested using the £120m paid initially to the Rwandan government to improve the UK’s system for handling claims. “Can I make the point that the salary of an immigration tribunal judge, first tier tribunal judge, is £117,000. If you put on costs, even most generously, that’s about £200,000. “Look at the £120m so far committed to the Rwanda scheme; there’s about 600 first tier tribunal judges could be bought for that, or any number of hundreds of Home Office case workers. Would that not be an alternative, actually to invest in the current system? … That would be a constructive alternative, surely,” he said. Tom Pursglove, the junior migration minister, replied: “That of itself will not solve this issue and I genuinely believe that the approach that we are taking through the comprehensive plan will shift the dial, will change the dynamic and will ultimately help us to shut down these evil criminal networks.” A Home Office spokesperson, said: “The Home Office is committed to constructive and open conversations with staff on our policies. However, personal attacks are unacceptable and we will remove comments from our channels that are disrespectful, break our guidelines or contravene the Civil Service values of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality.”",News/UK news,Home Office staff threaten mutiny over ‘shameful’ Rwanda asylum deal,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/20/home-office-staff-threaten-mutiny-over-shameful-rwanda-asylum-deal
4/21/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article is for people watching Moon Knight on Disney+. Do not read unless you have seen episodes one to four. Considering my role here as the writer of this Moon Knight recap, I know I am supposed to be the one offering insight, explaining plot developments, searching for clues and positing the odd theory, so I understand it’s not that helpful when I kick things off by asking: “What on Earth was that about”? But really, what on Earth was all that about? I was merrily watching Oscar Isaac playing second fiddle to May Calamawy in his own show and thinking about how, even though the series wasn’t going in the direction I thought it would, I was still really enjoying it. It seems like a very long time ago that we saw Moon Knight fighting rampaging hellhounds on the streets of London – or Moon Knight at all come to think of it – but the Tomb Raider/Uncharted adaptation of the opening 35 minutes of this episode were a blast, and certainly better than Tom Holland’s actual Uncharted adaptation. And then BAM. Just as I didn’t see Marc’s bullets in the chest coming, I wasn’t expecting things to go all One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, either. They were all there, in the “psychiatric hospital” – and I’m using quote marks as I don’t believe it’s really a hospital … Bek the henchman, Crawley the living statue without his makeup, annoying Donna and the fake police officers Billy and Bobbi. The whole gang. Then Harrow showed up as the doctor. Thankfully, Marc smelled a rat, even in his heavily sedated state, seeing one too many details in the room for it to be coincidence – the cane, the Egyptian artefacts, the drawing of Khonshu, the repeated line about not being able to help him, those awful sandals – and made a dash for it. At this point, the hospital being a construct, a trick played by Harrow, seemed certain. When Marc smashed that window, I was fully expecting the desert to be on the other side of the door, reminiscent of the scene in The First Avenger when Captain America realised he wasn’t in the 1940s and escaped into modern-day New York. But no, the illusion, if it is an illusion, runs deeper than that. This episode, The Tomb, asked more questions than it answered. How can Marc and Steven meet when they share a body? How can Taweret, the Egyptian goddess most closely associated with fertility, childbirth and rejuvenation, be there? Judging by the hippo’s cheery greeting, she’s happy to see Marc and Steven, and has possibly even seen them before, or knows who they are, but, given the way the episode cut to black with them screaming, they were just as confused as us viewers. Of course, it could be that everything we’ve seen in the three-and-a-bit episodes leading up to this point happened only in Marc’s head, but that seems the least likely explanation. Prior to all this, we got nearer the truth about Layla’s father, although there is still more to come on that front. We know that Abdullah was an “archaeologist on a mission”, and was working with a team in the desert when Marc’s partner got greedy and killed them all. All plausible, but who was Marc’s bloodthirsty partner? Is it going to be another person – and if that is the case, I don’t believe it’s a character we have already met. More likely, it’s the so-far-hinted-at maniacal third personality we may have caught a glimpse of in Cairo in episode three. Overall, I thought it was the strongest episode of the series so far. The danger with introducing a character like Moon Knight, with no obvious ties to the MCU, is that it feels rootless, given that one of the biggest draws to Marvel films and TV series is the connectivity. Now, four episodes in, while we’re still adrift, but we’ve learned enough about Marc, Steven, Layla and Harrow to feel invested. I didn’t miss Moon Knight or Khonshu in this episode, although I might start asking questions if their absence goes on much longer. With two episodes to go, I’m still not sure what the end point will be, but I’m going to stick around to find out – and not just because I am writing these recaps and it’s my job to do so. The actor playing Dr Steven Grant in Tomb Busters was Joseph Millson, best known for long stints in Peak Practice and Holby City. He was also Alan Jackson in The Sarah Jane Adventures. Jeff Lemire’s 2016 Moon Knight comic run had a storyline where Marc woke up in a psychiatric hospital only to be told that he’d been there for years and that he wasn’t Moon Knight. The hospital later transpired to be a fake and that Ammit, in disguise, was one of Marc’s doctors. Could that be what’s going on here? Who or what was in the third sarcophagus in the hospital? Taweret has never appeared in any Moon Knight or Marvel property before, making this her debut across all formats. The scene where Layla and Harrow speak about her father was written in because Calamawy and Ethan Hawke wanted to spend more time on screen together. Hawke apparently went away after shooting one day and had the whole conversation mapped out by the following morning. The location of Alexander the Great’s tomb is an enduring mystery, with more than 140 official attempts to find it. In 2021, Egyptian officials claimed they had found it in Siwa, near the Libyan border. What did you think? Is the institution in Marc’s head, or a trick played by Harrow? Will Khonshu be freed and give Marc back his powers?

4/21/2022,"The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he hoped military alliances like Nato could be ultimately disbanded, saying they could create “greater danger” in the world. In comments that are likely to inflame further tensions with Labour HQ, Corbyn said he did not blame Nato for the Russian invasion of Ukraine but that it had to be looked at in historical context. Corbyn is currently suspended from holding the Labour whip after comments made in the wake of the Equality and Human Rights Commission report into antisemitism in the party under his leadership. The Islington North MP said that people should “look at the process that could happen at the end of the Ukraine war” and questioned: “Do military alliances bring peace?” “I would want to see a world where we start to ultimately disband all military alliances,” he told Times Radio. “The issue has to be: what’s the best way of bringing about peace in the future? Is it by more alliances? Is it by more military buildup? “Or is it by stopping the war in Ukraine and the other wars … that are going on at the present time, which are also killing a very large number of people? And ask yourself the question: do military alliances bring peace? Or do they actually encourage each other and build up to a greater danger? “I don’t blame Nato for the fact that Russia has invaded Ukraine. What I say is look at the thing historically, and look at the process that could happen at the end of the Ukraine war.” The former leader said he would be “supporting Ukraine’s right to defend itself” if he was PM but would be focused on encouraging dialogue. Asked whether he backed Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he said: “I’ve never met him. I don’t know … I think he speaks well and I admire that.” Corbyn said the decision not to readmit him as a Labour MP was a “wrong, totally unjustified decision” by Labour leader Keir Starmer. Starmer told the Guardian last week that further comments by Corbyn, including his support for the Stop the War Coalition, had made his readmittance more difficult, saying he expected all Labour MPs to be supportive of Nato and not to draw “false equivalence” between Russia and Nato. Those comments led to a swift rebuttal from the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who said there had been commitment to Nato under Corbyn’s leadership. “A commitment to Nato has been Labour policy democratically determined by party conference and accepted by every Labour leader for inclusion in every Labour manifesto, including by Jeremy Corbyn, since Nato’s inception,” he tweeted. “If we can’t be honest in our assessments of Nato’s performance, lessons for how it performs its role in the future will never be learnt. On this basis I see no reason why Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t meet these new conditions for entitlement to the Labour whip.”",News/Politics,Jeremy Corbyn would like to see Nato ‘ultimately disband’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/jeremy-corbyn-would-like-to-see-nato-ultimately-disband

A murder investigation has been launched after the bodies of a man and woman in their 60s and another man in his 50s were discovered in Spring Gardens, Bourne End on Tuesday evening. All three victims were understood to be known to each other. Officers from Thames Valley Police were called to reports of a disturbance at the property shortly before 9.55pm. A spokesman said the evidence suggested a “serious assault” had occurred. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the killings. Senior investigating officer DS Kevin Brown, of the major crime unit, said: “The next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers, our thoughts remain with them at this most difficult time. “We are in the very early stages of this investigation and we are dealing with a very complex inquiry, which appears a targeted attack. We are not looking for anyone else in connection with it. “We would ask anyone who may have heard a disturbance or who may have seen anyone or anything unusual in or around Orchard House or Spring Gardens between 5pm and 10pm yesterday to please come forward and call 101, quoting reference 2037 of 19/4/2022.” He added that a crime scene would remain in place for a number of days and that the public would see an increased police presence in the area.

4/21/2022,"After two days on the stand in a $50m defamation case brought by Johnny Depp against his former wife, the actor concluded his narrative of their marriage by testifying Wednesday that accusations of domestic violence brought by former wife Amber Heard had destroyed his career. “When the allegations were made,” Depp told the court, “when they were circling the globe, telling people I was a drunken, cocaine-fueled menace who beat women, suddenly in my 50s, it’s over. You’re done. “No matter the outcome of this trial, the second those accusations were made against me, and they metastasized as fodder for the media, I lost,” he said. “I lost, and I’ll carry that for the rest of my life.” Depp’s courtroom exploration of his marriage, which will now be turned over to Heard’s lawyers for cross-examination, had earlier reached what in movie terms might be termed a climax as jurors in Fairfax, Virginia, viewed a photograph of the actor’s partially severed finger. Depp testified that Heard had become enraged when he had started drinking in Australia during the filming of one of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise films and had thrown a bottle of vodka at him, severing the top of his finger. “Blood was pouring out,” he said. “I think I went into some sort of … I don’t know what a nervous breakdown feels like, but that’s probably the closest that I’ve ever been. Nothing made sense.” Depp said he had hidden in a bathroom, and was later taken to a hospital where he told doctors the digit had been caught in large accordion doors. “I lied because ... I didn’t want to disclose that it had been Ms Heard that had thrown a vodka bottle at me and took my finger off,” he told the court in his lawsuit against his former wife. “I didn’t want to get her in trouble. ” During Depp’s second day of testimony, jurors also heard of events that marked the the end of their relationship, soon after Depp’s mother died in hospital. “I decided to call Amber and tell her that my mom had died that day. I said, ‘Look, I’ve made a decision and I think it’s the best thing. I’m going to file for divorce.’” He said that he told Heard he would not cite irreconcilable differences or any abuse in the relationship and went to their penthouses to collect some of his things while Heard was at Coachella. But Depp’s security guard told him it wasn’t a good time and showed the actor a photo on his phone of human waste on his side of the bed that was human fecal matter. “It was so outside, it was so bizarre and so grotesque that I could only laugh,” Depp said. Asked whether it was possible that it belonged to the couple’s teacup Yorkies, the actor said no. “I lived with those dogs for many years,” he said. “It was clear. That did not come from a dog. It just didn’t.” Heard later explained that it was the dogs’ “fecal delivery”. Depp said he could not accept that. Later, he said, Heard was on the phone with the artist iO Tillet Wright saying “the wonderful point of just how funny it was” that Depp thought the delivery was hers. Depp earlier recalled how Heard subjected him to an “endless parade of insults”, how he had “wanted to try to make it work, to help her. The Amber Heard I knew was not this opponent. She wasn’t my girl, she’d become my opponent.” Frequently the focus of their conflict, he said, was his drinking. “She’d been pretty brutish about telling me I needed to stop drinking,” Depp said, telling the actor he was “weak, a complete mess, an alcoholic ruining everything”. Depp said the exchanges frequently escalated into full-scale arguments. “Her need for conflict and violence erupts out of nowhere,” he said. “I learned to deal with it exactly as I did as a child, which was retreat.” The court in Fairfax, Virginia, has yet to hear Heard’s version of events but over a day and a half of Depp’s testimony so far, jurors have been given a tour of an unstable celebrity marriage colored by addiction. Depp is suing Heard for $50m, accusing her of defamation after she alleged violent domestic abuse. At issue throughout much of their marriage, Depp said, was Heard’s anger at his inability to stop using substances. At one point, he convinced Heard to stay at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills hotel while he attempted to come off a brand of potent prescription opioid painkillers, under the care of his doctor. “You won’t have to sit around ‘Mr Shakey’,” he told the jury he had said to his wife. He continued in his second day of testimony: “She wasn’t happy with it but she did eventually leave. So for a few days I sat around in a metal chair with one song on a loop so I could focus on the lyrics and the power of the song to help me get through it.” On another, after returning from Boston where he had been filming the movie Black Mass in May 2014, Depp said he paid for Heard and her friends to stay at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, while he again attempted to kick his habit. He had not been drinking to excess on the plane, where Heard alleges that an assault took place, but had taken two painkillers and locked himself in the bathroom to avoid her badgering, he said Depp testified that he had suggested Heard also stop drinking and taking drugs, which Depp has itemized as wine, ecstasy, mushrooms, and “a high-velocity speed”. Through this extended life story, Depp has weaved in aspects of his history with other women. Heard has said that the first time she was assaulted was when Depp slapped her in 2013 after she mocked a tattoo that had once said “Winona Forever” – a reference to the actor and former girlfriend Winona Ryder – but had since been changed to “Wino Forever”. “It didn’t happen,” he said of the alleged assault. “Why would I take such great offense to someone making fun of a tattoo on my body? That allegation never made any sense to me.” Heard, he suggested was jealous that Depp had not had himself inscribed with her name. Despite the difficulties in their brief marriage, Depp maintains that he never assaulted Heard, the allegation that goes to the heart of the defamation he claims she made in a 2018 Washington Post column. On Wednesday, he repeated that denial saying that his disputes with Heard would never cause him to hit her. “Violence isn’t necessary,” Depp said. “Why would you hit someone to make them agree with you?

4/21/2022,"The UK, US and Canada have staged a coordinated walkout of a G20 meeting in protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, amid growing risks of division between leading nations hitting the world economy. Representatives from the three countries left the session as Russian delegates spoke at the meeting in Washington. Sources said the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, and a senior Treasury official were among those to leave the talks. The walkout at the session, which was taking place on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings, came amid growing fears that a breakdown in international relations would severely undermine the global economy’s recovery from the pandemic and add to soaring inflation, pushing millions more people into poverty worldwide. In comments made shortly before the protest, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, warned 75 years of development gains were being put at risk by a splintering of international cooperation. Asked about reports of a potential walkout at the G20 meeting, Georgieva said the world had reached a “watershed moment” for global partnerships to tackle a range of issues including the pandemic, war in Ukraine, the climate emergency and rising poverty. “There are clearly very, very unsettling facts we have to deal with. I can say honestly I never thought that I would live through another war in Europe on the scale this one takes place,” she said. “We also recognise how interdependent we are. Just make the list of questions – no country can solve [them] on its own. It is so obvious that cooperation must and will continue.” The walkout came as western leaders challenged Russia’s membership of the G20 group of leading economies, which includes the US, UK, France and Germany, as well as powerful developing countries including China, Brazil and India. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, tweeted that UK representatives had walked out of the meeting. “We are united in our condemnation of Russia’s war against Ukraine and will push for stronger international coordination to punish Russia,” he said. Sources said the UK, US and other western nations were pushing for a consensus position on Russia’s continued membership of the G20 and had questioned the attendance of Kremlin representatives. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, told attendees she disapproved of a senior Russian official’s presence, according to Reuters. The US Treasury said earlier on Wednesday that Yellen met with Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the finance minister of Indonesia – which currently holds the rotating presidency of the G20 – to emphasise that there would “be no business-as-usual for Russia in the global economy”. Mohamed El-Erian, a former deputy director of the IMF who is now president of Queens’ College, Cambridge, said the flare-up showed the G20 was not functioning as an international body. “The future of multilateralism is at risk at a time when we need it most,” El-Erian said as he called on governments to continue to work together through alternative means. “The G20 is too divided, and lacks continuity. Its always been a puzzle to me why it doesn’t have a secretariat. You go through presidency by presidency – it changes every time. So very little gets done,” he said. “The one exception was the April 2009 London summit under Gordon Brown, that was the one exception. The G7 is too narrow in terms of membership. In terms of your existing tools it is a reformed and revamped IMF and World Bank.” The IMF said on Tuesday that risks to the global economy were growing as Russia’s war in Ukraine drove up inflation. The Washington-based fund said the war had increased the risk of a more permanent fragmentation of the global economy into geopolitical blocs. Such a “tectonic shift” would entail high adjustment costs for the global economy, it said.",News/World news,"US, UK and Canada walk out of G20 meeting over war in Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/us-uk-and-canada-walk-out-g20-meeting-war-in-ukraine-russia
4/21/2022,"Downing Street has gone into open battle with the Church of England over its condemnation of the Rwanda deportation scheme, with No 10 officials doubling down on Boris Johnson’s claim that archbishops were being unfairly critical. The prime minister reportedly told Conservative MPs on Tuesday evening that senior clergy had criticised plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda more than they had condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was not denied by No 10. On Wednesday morning a senior Church of England branded the comments a “disgraceful slur”. With Johnson declining to apologise, the office of Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, insisted he would continue to speak out about the policy on “moral and ethical grounds”, setting the ground for an ongoing row. A series of prominent Church of England figures defended Welby and the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, with one saying those who questioned their right to criticise the controversial Rwanda scheme “need to acquaint themselves with the most basic rudiments of Christianity”. Johnson, addressing Conservative MPs at a meeting on Tuesday, was said to have criticised the church and the BBC for being more condemnatory of the asylum policy than of Russia. Speaking to journalists on the plane on Wednesday night as he travelled to India, Johnson defended his criticism of Welby and the BBC.“I have a very good relationship with the archbishop. All I was saying was that I think we have an excellent policy to try and stop people drowning in the Channel. I was surprised to find it criticised,” he said. “What I said was I thought was very mild, and I was very surprised. All I said was I thought the policy was misconstrued on the BBC and by some parts of the clergy. That’s what I said. I had just come off phone to Paul Kagame {the Rwandan leader] who was making that exact point to me. I thought it has been misconstrued. As far as I understand it, it was all alright until the [BBC Radio 4’s] Today programme piled in.” Quizzed by Keir Starmer during prime minister’s questions (PMQs) earlier, Johnson vehemently denied attacking the BBC over its Russia coverage, calling this “completely without any foundation whatever”. But he pointedly did not deny the condemnation of the church and bishops, and declined Starmer’s invitation to apologise, saying only that he had been “slightly taken aback” by vehement criticism of the plan in Welby and Cottrell’s Easter sermons, with the former calling the Rwanda policy “opposite of the nature of God”. Speaking after PMQs, Johnson’s press secretary said she could not comment on remarks made at a private meeting but refuted that Johnson criticised the BBC for its coverage of Ukraine. Asked what Johnson thought about the church’s criticisms of the Rwanda plan, as against its comments on Russia, she said: “You heard him answer the first point, where he said he was surprised to be criticised for a policy that is designed to end deaths at sea that are a result of people being exploited by criminal gangs.” The Church of England’s head of news, John Bingham, said if the reports of Johnson’s comment were true it was a “disgraceful slur” and that both archbishops had strongly condemned Russia over the war on Ukraine. A statement by Welby’s office said both he and Cottrell, as well as other faith leaders, were “gravely concerned by proposals to send migrants overseas”, adding: “They will continue to speak out against these plans on moral and ethical grounds.” Both archbishops “have condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an act of great evil and spoken out repeatedly against it”, it added. Rev Richard Coles, the vicar of Finedon who is also a prominent radio presenter, said it was perfectly valid for the archbishops to criticise the policy. “People who question the archbishop of Canterbury’s right to criticise government policy need to acquaint themselves with the most basic rudiments of Christianity,” said Coles. “Christianity always insists, or should insist, that we uphold the dignity of every person, and I don’t think this policy is one that fully respects the dignity of people who are seeking asylum in this country.” Alan Wilson, the bishop of Buckingham, insisted criticism of the Rwanda policy was not overtly political. “One of the things all of us who preach the word of God do is expound the scriptures, and when you look at the Christian scriptures, again and again and again they tell us to be generous to the stranger within your gate, to the person you’ve never met,” Wilson said in an interview on Premier Christian Radio. He added: “Yes of course there should be criminal sanctions against people traffickers, and of course there should be a proper police reaction to all forms of crime, but to take it out on the most vulnerable people in the world is silly,” he said of the government’s Rwanda asylum policy. Jayne Ozanne, a member of the church’s General Synod, who was formerly on a government advisory panel on LGBTQ+ issues, said Johnson “has shown himself to be devoid of a conscience and frankly would do well to seek advice from the archbishop and listen to his counsel, before asking for both his and the nation’s forgiveness”.",News/Politics,No 10 goes into battle with archbishops over Rwanda asylum plan ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/pmqs-boris-johnson-denies-bbc-criticism-no-justin-welby-apology
4/21/2022,"The looks on the Tory frontbench said it all. Dominic Raab, Alok Sharma, Liz Truss and Sajid Javid could barely bring themselves to even glance at Boris Johnson. Their eyes were dead, their faces expressionless. Just wishing they were anywhere but in the Commons for prime minister’s questions. Beam me up. Realising they were stuck in their leader’s own nightmare. Partygate wasn’t going away any time soon. It would be with them for months yet. Slowly dragging everyone down with it. The Convict’s shame was now their shame. Johnson was keen to move on. He was desperate to talk about the cost of living crisis – even though it’s getting worse by the day under his government. At this rate, half the country will be eating from food banks by the end of the year. That’s if anyone can afford to use a cooker. Anything but focus on his own criminality. Boris had made an apology of sorts the evening before. It had been devoid of any real contrition, but so what? It would have to do. Real repentance would suggest a desire to change. And he felt no such thing. All The Convict was really sorry for was having got caught. The law was never meant for people like him. But it was never going to work out so easily for Johnson. There would be more fines for far more serious offences. Tory MPs who had gone out on a limb to defend him for his birthday party – the kind of gathering that the prime minister had said was illegal on an almost nightly basis during his lockdown press conferences – would now find themselves thrown under a bus as they were asked to explain all the other piss-ups. Keir Starmer was in no mood to let Johnson off the hook. He began with a simple question. One to which he knew The Convict had no answer. Why had he accepted Allegra Stratton’s resignation? If there had never been any parties, as he had frequently told MPs, why was there any need for her to leave No 10? Boris mumbled incoherently and tugged The Toddler Haircut. His face was pasty and he was looking like carrion. It’s a surprise no one has suggested he goes for his own good, never mind the country’s. This was a visceral cross-examination. The Labour leader used to try to keep PMQs on a strictly professional working basis. The forensic semi-detached lawyer. But now he makes no attempt to conceal his hatred and contempt for Johnson. It drips like acid from every sentence. And is all the more deadly for it. It’s not the rambling, shambolic dislike that Boris has for Starmer and anyone else who dares challenge him. It’s directed with laser precision. After listing others who had paid for their rule-breaking with their jobs, Starmer returned to Johnson’s behaviour the previous day. Having put on a show for the TV cameras in the Commons of apologising for having been found guilty of breaking the law – it’s still not clear if he really believes he broke a law, or if he thinks the law applies to him – he showed his true colours in a private meeting of Tory MPs. The struggle of being on his best behaviour for two hours had been too much and The Convict had let rip. He’d never really been guilty of anything. The rules were stupid and he’d be sure to give a piece of his mind to whoever had made them. Worst of all were the BBC and the archbishop of Canterbury, who had been tougher on the government’s immigration policy than they had on Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Johnson confected outrage. Starmer was nothing but a Corbynista in an Islington suit, he blustered. It still didn’t work when he tried the line a second time. No one believes Starmer is a Corbynista and it was Johnson who used to own the £3.75m Islington house. Up until the point he got slung out for having yet another affair. Lying and deceit are The Convict’s life-blood. He then did a bit of PR for the Rwandan tourist board. The country was basically one big holiday camp and if his plan did have a fault, it was that refugees would be clogging up Kent beaches in their desperation to get a free air ticket to Kigali. But even then, the Rwandans would be thrilled to get so many immigrants. It was almost as if he believed that immigration could be beneficial to a country. Then The Convict turned his attention to the BBC. He had never said the BBC was biased in its journalism. It had just been a story invented by the … er, Daily Telegraph. Tell that to the prime minister’s press spokesperson, who briefed the hacks. Tory MPs who had only just got used to the idea that the Beeb were evil lefties who should have the licence fee withdrawn looked understandably nonplussed by this sudden reversal but chose to roll with it. Everything was a lie, he insisted. He had been slandered. The irony of Boris accusing others of lying didn’t escape anyone. By now Johnson was careering out of control and he barely survived the rest of the session as one opposition MP after another pointed out that he couldn’t be trusted to tell the truth about anything. Even the most vocal Tory backbenchers fell silent as it gradually dawned on them that their champion was now their liability. They just wanted it all to stop. But it had barely just begun. There was only one ending to this. And it wouldn’t be pretty for The Convict.",News/Politics,Starmer makes no attempt to conceal his hatred and contempt for The Convict,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/starmer-makes-no-attempt-to-conceal-his-hatred-and-contempt-for-the-convict
4/21/2022,"When Graham Phillips first moved from London to Ukraine, the Nottingham-born civil servant set up a personal blog that mixed reviews of brothels with observations about everyday life in Kyiv. A decade later, the pro-Kremlin YouTuber finds himself accused in parliament of potential war crimes after interviewing a fellow Briton captured by the Russian army. Prime minister Boris Johnson told MPs he was concerned by Phillips’ “propaganda messages” featuring Aiden Aslin, a British national who has spent the last four years living in Ukraine and serving with the country’s armed forces. Aslin’s local MP Robert Jenrick went further, saying Phillips’ video showed his constituent “handcuffed, physically injured and being interviewed under duress for propaganda purposes”. He said it was a breach of the Geneva conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war and that “the interviewer Graham Phillips is in danger of prosecution for war crimes”. Aslin was captured by Russian forces while defending the besieged city of Mariupol, although it remains unclear how he ended up being interviewed by Phillips. The two men are both originally from Nottinghamshire: 28-year-old Aslin hails from the town of Newark-on-Trent, just a short drive outside Phillips’ home city. Yet it took a conflict on the other side of Europe to bring them together – albeit on different sides. While Aslin moved to Ukraine, met a local woman and joined the country’s armed forces, Phillips took a very different route and has long been a favoured mouthpiece for pro-Russian breakaway governments in the Donbas region. He has received medals from the Russian state for his reporting and toed the Russian line, suggesting in recent weeks that Ukraine is run by Nazis and the massacre of Ukrainians in Bucha was staged. Phillips insists his work is self-funded and regularly solicits donations from his 264,000 YouTube subscribers, but he also earns money from YouTube adverts paid for by major western companies. On Wednesday morning people attempting to watch Phillips’ potentially Geneva conventions-infringing interview with Aslin were greeted with paid-for adverts featuring Piers Morgan talking about his show on the forthcoming TalkTV channel and promotions for Müller yoghurt. YouTube has so far declined to take down Phillips’ videos, despite calls from politicians to remove the channel. His rise from obscure Brit abroad to figure of national political interest was unlikely. According to a 2014 interview with BuzzFeed News, Phillips first went to Ukraine when travelling as an away fan to an England football match. Aged 30, he quit his job at the now defunct government Central Office of Information and moved full-time to the country where he reinvented himself as a journalist. When Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Phillips found himself drawn to the country’s pro-Moscow separatist groups in the east of the country. His prolific self-recorded clips on YouTube were a relative novelty at the time and delighted Russia, with the Kremlin-backed RT news channel briefly using him as a freelance journalist – although he never gained full-time employment with the outlet. His detention by the Ukrainian government on the outskirts of Mariupol gained him notoriety, but he soon slipped out of the public eye as western interest in the conflict receded. His uploads became infrequent, often focusing on visits to Crimea, and he attracted only a few thousand views. One clip saw him boast about being the only western journalist to attend a tour of Russia’s “legendary Black Sea fleet” and taking a small boat to look at the power of the flagship Moskva. That flagship has since sunk, appearing to have been hit by Ukrainian missiles. During the pandemic Phillips was in the UK, filming himself at anti-Black Lives Matter protests in central London. As recently as February, he uploaded a video in central London opposite the Houses of Parliament. The level of scaffolding on the Elizabeth Tower suggests it was recorded at the same time, meaning he was in Britain when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. He subsequently managed to return to Russian-held areas of Ukraine, despite few airlines flying to the region, becoming one of the few western individuals filming videos from the occupied territory alongside Russian forces. How he ended up in a room interviewing Aslin remains unclear – although it has given him the profile he has always seemed to crave.",News/World news,"Who is Graham Phillips, the YouTuber accused of ‘war crimes’?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/who-is-graham-phillips-the-youtuber-accused-of-war-crimes
4/21/2022,"Before escaping on an official visit to India on Wednesday, Boris Johnson ensured that headlines were dominated by his spurious attacks on the archbishop of Canterbury and the BBC, rather than his own egregious behaviour during Partygate. Deflection and bluster are, increasingly, what gets Mr Johnson through the day. This strategy of evasion is usually complemented by an earnest plea that he should be allowed to get on with delivering the priorities of the British people. At Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, “fixing the energy crisis” was identified as one of the key areas Mr Johnson could focus on, if only people stopped harping on about him flouting the Covid laws he set. The prime minister at least alighted on the right issue to make his rhetorical point. But far more than the usual Johnsonian cant will be needed to deal with the truly alarming scale and implications of spiralling fuel costs. Testifying to MPs on Tuesday, the CEOs of Britain’s major energy companies reported unprecedented levels of calls from customers who fear they will not be able to pay their bills. Further vertiginous price rises in October – when Ofgem is expected to again raise the price cap – could place 40% of households in fuel poverty. In the words of the CEO of ScottishPower, Keith Anderson: “It has got to a stage now where the size and scale of it is beyond … what this industry can deal with. I think it needs a massive shift … in the government policy and approach.” There is naturally an element of industry self-interest here: energy bosses have no wish to be exposed to bad debts during a crisis that the money-saving expert Martin Lewis has warned could lead to civil unrest. But the central thrust of the CEOs’ analysis, shared by fuel poverty campaigners, is entirely correct: a perfect storm of economic factors, primarily related to the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, requires significant government intervention to protect people from the consequences of a broken market. This could be some kind of deficit fund to help poorer households, as proposed by Mr Anderson, or another form of subsidy. But as families face unsustainable headwinds, proper economic support is imperative. At the same time, if the country is to meet its net zero obligations, the government must be more proactive in shaping a green transition that can cut bills by reducing energy use. Labour’s promotion of a £60bn scheme to insulate homes shows what could be done by a government without ideological hang-ups regarding state intervention. In Italy, where the government has offered a 110% tax credit on energy-efficient home renovations, 150,000 new jobs have been created since 2020. There is no evidence that Mr Johnson or his beleaguered chancellor, Rishi Sunak, wish to engage with any of this. Instead, the government has chosen to offer minimal support to vulnerable households, and temporary rebates based on the flawed assumption that the fuel price rises amount to a short-term spike. Its recently published energy strategy – delayed as Mr Sunak haggled over the cost – conveniently focused on long-term nuclear goals which may or may not be realised, ignoring the current cost-of-living crunch altogether. If Mr Johnson really wishes to “deliver on the people’s priorities”, his administration will need to snap out of its siege mentality, stop seeking out bogus dividing lines and get ahead of this crisis before it is too late.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on spiralling fuel bills: Johnson must get a grip | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/20/the-guardian-view-on-spiralling-fuel-bills-johnson-must-get-a-grip
4/21/2022,"Even by the standards of China’s overzealous censors, suppressing a hashtag that simply quoted its national anthem was striking stuff. The opening line – “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!” – had been deployed to express the growing anger and distress in Shanghai as what was supposed to be a short, sharp lockdown stretched on for weeks, with gruelling results for individuals as well as damaging effects on the economy. On Wednesday the city eased restrictions somewhat, with millions allowed to leave home for the first time in weeks. Yet even if the worst proves to be over in the financial centre, experiencing China’s biggest outbreak since the virus first emerged in Wuhan, concerns about the country’s insistence on a zero-Covid strategy will persist. Outside China, the attention has been on the draconian nature of restrictions, with reports of the separation of small children from their parents, people dying from other medical problems because they could not access help, and the beating to death of a dog whose owner had apparently been sent to a quarantine centre. Plenty in China have lambasted the inhumanity, but it is also the inefficiency of authorities which has shocked. An international, sophisticated metropolis is asking why officials insisted there would be no lockdown until the last minute, leaving residents no time to prepare; why the testing and isolation process appears beset by confusion; why conditions are so poor in crowded quarantine centres; and why food is in such short supply. Officials have admitted “difficulties”. Delivery remains at the centre of the party’s legitimacy, even if nationalism has become an increasingly potent force. Many citizens looked at the huge death tolls elsewhere and concluded that zero-Covid was the right course. China was the first major economy to reopen and grow; much of the country has gone about its business as usual since last spring. For obvious reasons it is very hard to gauge public opinion – still less what that opinion might be without the omnipresent censorship and propaganda. But Edelman research suggests that trust levels in the central government in early 2022 were the highest in a decade. Shanghai’s experiences have cracked the glossy surface of authoritarian competence. To let the virus loose now, with low vaccination rates among older people, and reliance on the less effective domestically produced vaccine, would be likely to result in significant disruption and death. Because China’s death toll is so extraordinarily low – due in part to the manner of reporting – many people see less reason to be vaccinated, but also less reason to be locked down. At least some residents are asking whether, thanks to vaccines, there is a wiser middle path between letting the virus rip and attempting elimination, which seems increasingly futile thanks to the highly transmissible Omicron variant. But Xi Jinping’s personal endorsement of zero Covid, and the expectation that he will break precedent by claiming a third term as China’s leader at this year’s party congress, makes a change of course look extraordinarily unlikely before then. Stability is all. Shanghai’s struggle is not an existential issue for the party. It has survived far worse. But about 45 cities – many large, but less well-known and well-connected – are under some form of lockdown. Each one is likely to erode a little further the confidence of citizens. The zero-Covid strategy comes at a cost for the leadership as well as those it rules.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on China’s zero-Covid strategy: no way out? | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/20/the-guardian-view-on-shanghais-lockdown-the-costs-of-zero-covid
4/21/2022,"A Ukrainian marine commander fighting in Mariupol has said his forces are “maybe facing our last days, if not hours”, as another Russian ultimatum to the remaining Ukrainian troops in the besieged port city to surrender or die expired with no mass capitulation. “The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one,” Serhiy Volyna, a commander from the 36th separate marine brigade, said in a video message posted on Facebook. “We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us. We ask them to use the procedure of extraction and take us to the territory of a third-party state.” Vastly outnumbered Ukrainian forces have formed a stubborn pocket of resistance in the Azovstal iron and steelworks – a sprawling mass of tunnels and workshops spread over four square miles in the south-east of the city and the last holdout of troops defending Mariupol. Russian-backed separatists said shortly before a 2pm (11am GMT) Wednesday deadline that just five people had surrendered. Similar surrender demands earlier this week were ignored. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said an estimated 1,000 civilians were sheltering at the plant. He said he remained ready to swap Russian prisoners of war in exchange for safe passage for the trapped civilians and Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian troops said on Tuesday the Russian military had dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of the plant and hit a makeshift hospital where hundreds were staying. Serhiy Taruta, the former governor of Donetsk and a Mariupol native, said 300 people, including wounded troops and civilians with children, were sheltering at the hospital. The reports could not be independently verified by the Guardian. Moscow is edging closer to full control of the city in what would be its biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February. Relentless bombardment and street fighting have left much of it pulverised, killing at least 21,000 people by Ukrainian estimates. Those who haven’t managed to flee have been trapped for weeks without power, running water and other supplies. Ukraine announced plans on Wednesday morning to send 90 buses to evacuate 6,000 civilians from Mariupol, saying it had reached a “preliminary agreement” with Russia on a safe corridor, for the first time in weeks. None of those earlier agreements succeeded on the ground, with Moscow blocking the convoys. On Wednesday evening the Donetsk regional governor said fewer buses than planned had reached the city. “People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got on to the buses,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said, providing no figures. Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said on Wednesday that 100,000 civilians remained in the city, and that about 40,000 civilians had been forcibly moved to Russia or Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine. Boychenko urged residents to leave if they could. “Do not be frightened, and evacuate to Zaporizhzhia, where you can receive all the help you need – food, medicine, essentials – and the main thing is that you will be in safety,” he said. The fall of Mariupol, the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron, steel and heavy machinery, would be an economic blow to Ukraine and a symbolic victory for Russia. The town is a large port city and a base for Ukrainian armed forces. Taking control would give Moscow a land corridor from the Donbas to Crimea. The long-anticipated large-scale military operation in the Donbas and second phase of the war began on Monday with Russian forces carrying out one of the biggest barrages of missile strikes since the beginning of the invasion. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Russia was focusing on advancing towards the strategically important Donbas city of Sloviansk, but “so far they are not succeeding”. So far, according to Ukrainian officials, the frontline in Ukrainian-controlled Donbas is holding. The Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov described Kreminna in northern Luhansk – which was seized by Russian forces on Tuesday – as a “weak spot”. Moscow’s troops frequently attack Ukrainian positions from all sides, said Zhdanov, and were occupying jumping-off points on three sides of the Donbas region: north, east and south. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said Russian forces may be able to take some territory because of superior numbers and artillery. It stressed, however: “Russian operations are unlikely to be dramatically more successful than previous major offensives around Kyiv. The Russian military is unlikely to have addressed the root causes – poor coordination, the inability to conduct cross-country operations, and low morale – that impeded prior offensives.” On the diplomatic front, a UN spokesperson said on Wednesday that the UN secretary general António Guterres has asked to meet Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy in their respective capitals. The UN has been largely marginalised in the crisis, in part because the war has divided the UN security council permanent members: the United States, France, Britain, China and Russia. China has refused to condemn the invasion, depicting Russia as a victim of western efforts to weaken it. On Tuesday a group of more than 200 former senior UN officials wrote to Guterres, warning him that unless he did more personally to take a lead in trying to mediate a peace in Ukraine, the UN risked not just irrelevance, but its continued existence.",News/World news,"Ukrainian commander in Mariupol says forces ‘facing last days, if not hours’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/humanitarian-corridor-out-of-mariupol-agreed-with-russia-says-ukraine
4/21/2022,"My partner has been emailing and having phone conversations with a former female friend. She contacted him (which he told me about at the time) and they’ve been emailing daily since – he did not divulge their continued correspondence. I found out because I glanced down at his phone whilst we were in bed a couple of weeks ago and saw a message saying “Morning Sweetpea xx” from her to him. We have had difficult times in the past with him lying and having “private” conversations with former girlfriends, colleagues etc, but only the night before he’d said how lovely it was to be able to be honest and open and have nothing hidden, and it was the first time he’d been in that position in a relationship. I feel sad and disappointed and have lost respect for him. He says that my behaviour (being quiet and withdrawn) is only hurting me. He seems to have a different understanding of “open and honest” and doesn’t think he’s acted in opposition to that because it’s platonic (she lives quite a long way away and lives with her partner). But I think he kept it a secret and if it was purely platonic, he would have told me. I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer last year (and I know that it’s difficult for him as well as me) but since then he’s had “platonic” contact with three female colleagues and this former friend. He’s very affectionate, loving and kind. How do I get past this, and should I? Eleanor says: As a pretty good rule: someone who doesn’t know they’re doing anything wrong doesn’t know to keep it a secret. I remember reading about a therapist who’d worked with hundreds of post-affair couples in a career that spanned back to the 60s, when most affairs started in the office. She said the moment worth paying attention to isn’t the first touch or the first kiss. It’s the first time people keep a secret from their partners. One person says something to the other that they’d prefer their partner never heard, or conspires to conceal where they really were or why they went. The secret creates a sealed bubble that their partner isn’t let into – a relationship with someone else underpinned by the mutual knowledge that the space between them is secret; private. Whether or not those two people ever kiss, something interesting has already happened. Something stands in need of explanation. Of course, sometimes the explanation is just that the partner at home is sufficiently jealous that being candid about innocent contact still feels like too much of a risk. But that doesn’t sound like what’s going on here. You say this has been an issue several times already. You know what I know – people say good morning when they’re in fairly constant contact; they use affectionate names like “sweetpea” when they’re being affectionate. This is causing you enough consternation to want to write to me. To me, it sounds like he’s stoking a crush in a way he knows you’d be unhappy about. That doesn’t automatically mean that he or the relationship aren’t worth your time. Conflicts like this happen, and can be worked on. But you’ve had a huge ordeal with your diagnosis recently and you’re entitled to be judicious about how much of anything you “work on” just now. In particular, it would be a real shame if you keep being the only person in this relationship who recognises a flirtation for what it is. There are all kinds of open conversations you could have about why he wants to do this – maybe he likes the flattery, maybe he wants to feel young and unattached to combat the fear of being neither, maybe you’re right to notice some connection with your diagnosis. But – and this is important – these are not yours to figure out alone. If you’re trying to understand this while he’s six blocks behind you denying that there’s anything puzzling, that won’t work, and it isn’t fair. Perhaps a place to start is to ask yourself: If this never changed or kept recurring, would you want to stay in the relationship? If the answer is “no”, the next question is: will he work with you to honour that preference? Getting stuck in an empirical back-and-forth won’t help either of you. The question isn’t what exactly is right or wrong by the technical letters of monogamy. The question is whether this relationship can be one where you both feel safe and cared for.

4/21/2022,"“I’m sitting in the box, [Cristiano] Ronaldo’s family’s box, next to Georgina, his wife, watching the game,” says Alistair Edwards. “And then after the game Ronaldo comes in and he invites us to his house, so you go to his house. So it’s in those times I think, ‘yeah, life has been pretty good’.” That would seem an understatement, especially in the context of the Australian coach’s inglorious exit from Perth Glory in 2013. And in the past few years, life has indeed been pretty good. Edwards has been almost a forgotten man in A-League Men’s coaching circles since his stint in charge of the Glory ended prematurely due to a difference in views between he and owner Tony Sage over the direction of the club. Not that he has any regrets. He has since visited Ronaldo’s house in Turin – when the Portuguese star played for Juventus – and wines and dines with super agent Jorge Mendes in high-end Barcelona restaurants. Perhaps the biggest surprise in all of this is not the fact Edwards enjoying such an existence, it is that he is doing so because he is the technical director of a club not in Europe but Asia. Malaysian side Johor Darul Ta’zim, better known around the continent as JDT, is the very definition of a super club. Within the space of a decade they have transformed themselves from a state-owned, middle-of-the-road Malaysian Super League club to one of the true glamour outfits of Asian football. Rolls Royce limousines, private jets and pre-season tours in Dubai – everything JDT does screams luxury and excess. To understand the size and scale of this new powerhouse, simply watch its recently produced anthem, Pioneers. The music video’s frontman? Snoop Dogg. The sight of the iconic West Coast rapper in a JDT kit dropping lyrics like “I’m in it like JDT S N double O P bout to kick it on fresh grass” feels like a trick on the eyes. But it is not, because this is JDT. And it is all due to the vision – and let’s be honest, the money – of one man: Tunku Ismail ibni Sultan Ibrahim, the Crown Prince of Johor. Better known as TMJ, he is a man with a contact book as thick as any in world football and who counts Ronaldo as a personal friend. TMJ had the funds and the plan, and one of the first people he tasked with executing it was Edwards, a former player of the old Johor FA team in the 1990s and something of a legend in the oil-rich southern Malaysian state bordering Singapore. Edwards was entranced by his vision and ambition, but knew Malaysian football well enough to come at it with a healthy dose of scepticism. “Because when he talked about what he wanted to do,” Edwards says, “like dominate Malaysian football, build the best infrastructure in Asia, play in the Asian Champions League; when you’re looking at a Malaysian team, to play in the Champions League has never been done before. “And when I was here, in the 1990s, nothing much had changed from that [time] in terms of the football. Everything was the same, the way it’s run and everything. It wasn’t really moving, but TMJ was starting to move it. So when he was explained to me what his plans were, they looked incredible.” The club’s home ground, Larkin Stadium, was dilapidated. Soon enough it was completely refurbished, inside and out, into one of the best in Southeast Asia. Plans were unveiled for a 40,000-seat, state-of-the-art stadium the likes of which Malaysia had not seen before, and in 2020 the Sultan Ibrahim Stadium opened. This month the venue will host Group I of the AFC Champions League, which sees JDT pitted against continental giants Kawasaki Frontale, Ulsan Hyundai and Guangzhou Evergrande. In their opening game on the weekend, under manager Benjamin Mora, they beat Chinese Super League side Guangzhou 5-0. On Monday night they stunned South Korea’s 2020 champions Ulsan 2-1, and sit top of the group entering Friday night’s third match against J1 League leaders Kawasaki This stadium and this stage is where JDT, champions for eight straight seasons in Malaysia, now comfortably sit. Edwards’s role at the club has changed over the years. Similarly to when he worked for Football Federation Australia as Joeys coach, much has centred around creating and developing the academy structures to develop a pipeline of talent – one that is showing early signs of bearing fruit. “We set up the academy from basically scratch,” 53-year-old Edwards says. “So now we have an academy from under-12s all the way through our under-21s … it’s a proper academy in terms of the players come in at 11 years old and they live there, they go to school there, they have all the nutritionists and everything.” “Our JDT II team, which is playing in the second division, 12 of the players in the squad are from the academy. In our first team there’s four players that are regularly training with the first team and three of them regularly playing, like Arif Aiman. [He’s] the youngest in our group [and] he’s amazing. He’s 19 years old, we plucked him up when he was 15 or 16 from the national program here, where he was playing in the second team, by the way. “So we bought him in here and he played in our under-19 team and JDT II, and to cut a long story short he was probably our best player last year and he’s 19 years old. So that’s the kind of thing that is happening because of all the great work that TMJ has done.” As glowing as Edwards is of TMJ, the same is true in reverse. “He’s a legend in Johor football,” the Crown Prince says, “and has been contributing to the system for a very long time, both as a player and now technical director. Him being in the organisation inspires many young people at the club to do well. “As technical director, he is key to our youth development programme and keeps a keen eye on our JDT academy, which has grown tremendously in recent years.”",Sport/Football,"Cristiano Ronaldo, Snoop Dogg and Asia's glamour club – the second coming of Alistair Edwards | Paul Williams",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/cristiano-ronaldo-snoop-dogg-and-asias-glamour-club-the-second-coming-of-alistair-edwards
4/21/2022,"Sangita Jogi’s illustration Women Partying, a joyful depiction of an all-girl disco nightclub, looks very much like something you might see in Teen Vogue. In reality, it’s on the wall at the National Gallery of Victoria, as part of a new exhibition highlighting new acquisitions from contemporary Indian artists in rural, regional, and Indigenous traditions, some handed down for centuries. What is unique about 19-year-old Sangita is that she works in a style practised only in her family: Jogi art, an energetic drawing style using in black ink on white paper, featuring detailed patterns and large, complex composition. It’s been practised for three generations of the Jogi family – which is to say, it’s startlingly modern. “What’s distinctive about this family, as opposed to others, is that they haven’t inherited this style,” says Wayne Crothers, senior curator of Asian art at the NGV. “It’s come out of them preserving their narrative traditions or their singing and performing traditions.” “I was inspired by the idea of women celebrating,” Sangita says of her work. “Women are so burdened, and women who are poor, even more so. So I just thought of making a work about the opposite scenario – of women enjoying themselves”. The Jogi artform started with Sangita’s parents, Ganesh and Teju. Their family name derives from their community, the Jogi, in rural Rajasthan. Untrained in visual art, the Jogi were traditionally roving musicians, singers of devotional songs and stories. Their music also had a practical function. “The Jogi were the alarm clocks of earlier times,” says Minhazz Majumdar, a New Delhi curator who worked with the NGV on the exhibition. “They’d sing songs at the crack of dawn … we always had a barter system going, somebody would pay them.” By the 1970s, urbanisation was making such a livelihood increasingly untenable. Then severe drought hit. Facing crop failure and famine, Teju and Ganesh were forced to move to the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, in search of work – often dangerous, low-paid manual labour. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning It was then that Ganesh met anthropologist Haku Shah, part of a wave of Indian scholars and curators seeking to preserve cultural traditions threatened by the pace of social change. Shah urged Ganesh to record the narratives in Jogi songs, to protect them from being lost to history. Ganesh could not write, so Shah suggested he draw the stories. “He was so scared he would break the pen at first,” says Majumdar – she’s worked with the family for over 20 years – “and now, the children do it in their own style.” Ganesh and Teju had 10 children, of whom six have survived; all of them paint and draw. “Drawing is like a meditation, like a healing space for me – I lose myself in my drawings, in creating all the details … they make me forget my struggles,” says Prakash, Sangita’s older brother. In his intricate work Cityscape (2017), Prakash depicts his home in Ahmedabad the way he saw it as a child; tall apartment blocks, puffing smoke towers, and masses of tiny human figures scurrying between them, uniformly intent on their business, ignoring the fish and turtles in the Sabarmati River that winds through the city. A close look reveals every figure is unique – they all have different socks, or hair, or eyes. Prakash is teaching his teenage son to draw in the Jogi style; nobody in the family sings any more, except Teju and Ganesh. But while the Jogi family’s pivot to a whole new medium is dramatic, all the art forms featured in the exhibition are undergoing rapid transformation. “A lot of these families, who have been practising these works for centuries and centuries, it’s been more within the domestic context,” says Sunita Lewis, project officer at the NGV. “But the last few decades, they’ve been changing the medium, or they’ve been changing the themes, in order to make them a commodity and reach a far wider audience than just their own communities.” “Commodity” is a word curators often shy away from, but these artists aren’t hobbyists or members of India’s urban middle class. Art is their livelihood: if their traditions are to survive and stay relevant, they need a market. Sujuni, a style of embroidered quilt, was traditionally a way for women to reuse scrap fabric for practical gifts; now, they’re made for display to sell on the international art market, providing village women with a livelihood. Contemporary sujuni work often features motifs of women’s independence like laptops and mopeds. Similarly, Madhubani art originated with murals painted in homes for significant events like marriage and childbirth; now, Madhubani artists are working on paper in order to sell or display their art internationally, tackling themes like climate change, female foeticide, and Covid-19. Artists are also increasingly signing their work – something that wasn’t always done in the past, or demanded by collectors. Most of the older works in the NGV exhibition are by unknown or unrecorded artists. “The fact that the market has woken up is making it easier now to promote these artists as artists, and not as nameless, faceless carriers of tradition,” Majumdar says. But, she concedes, increased interest from the art market doesn’t always translate into a secure future for artists. For the most part, the Jogi family are still pretty much where they were 20 years ago – except Sangita, who recently moved away from Ahmedabad. She lives in rural Rajasthan with her husband, and she’s just had her first child – a girl. Sangita has never been dancing in a nightclub. Women Partying, she says, was based on parties she’s seen in movies and TV, and her imagination. “My style is more fantasy-like, compared to my family,” Sangita says. “I draw what I would like to see – empowered women enjoying life.” And, she says, she’s teaching her daughter to draw.

4/21/2022,"Each time News Corp turns its sights on a new target, Twitter campaigners blame an unprecedented “Murdochracy” for the dire state of our political culture. Yet we need to remember that every significant social movement in Australian history has faced vocal – and sometimes overwhelming – opposition from the mainstream press. In 1856, when stonemasons working at the University of Melbourne marched through the city demanding the eight-hour day, the Melbourne Herald attacked them as “stupid mischievous blockhead[s]” engaging in “childish and useless perambulations”. During the campaign against the Vietnam war, the Daily Telegraph urged citizens to avoid the moratorium demonstration like “a plague spot”, warning that anyone who attended took “a share in the mob’s blind recklessness, and that is a needless moral burden which no sane man will care to shoulder”. After police attacked the first gay liberation Mardi Gras in 1978, the Sydney Morning Herald published the names of all those arrested, more or less guaranteeing their victimisation by employers and landlords. If you try to change society, you necessarily challenge those invested in the status quo. Almost by definition, you must take on the corporations that benefit from the world-as-it-is – a category that, since at least the last 150 years, has included the various media empires. That’s why, during most of the 20th century, newspapers, as a matter of course, urged their readers to vote conservative. “The Australian presses,” writes Nick Economou, “privately owned and, for a large part of their history, subject to the authoritarian style of individual proprietors who saw intervention as the right of proprietorship, had a long record of never endorsing the Australian Labor Party.” When the Melbourne Herald – the pre-eminent title in the Herald and Weekly Times stable – backed Bob Hawke in 1983, its decision broke a century-long run of anti-Labor editorials. Back then, newspaper endorsements mattered – or, at least, they mattered considerably more than they do now. Before the internet, Australians possessed few choices for news. If you lived in a metropolitan region, you opted between two or three daily papers and you tuned in to a handful of TV and radio stations. The jingle with which Melbourne’s Channel Nine promoted its newsreader Brian Naylor captures something of the power that journalists once possessed. “I know everything I need to know,” it ran, “because Brian told me so.” No contemporary outlet would dare make a similar claim to a monopoly on relevant information. How could they? Today, the internet’s become the main source of news for Australians – and the diversity on offer dramatically reduces the authority of any particular outlet. A survey found only 43% of Australians trusted the media, the only major institution distrusted by the majority of the population. The popular scepticism about the media pertains particularly to the outlets most associated with rightwing culture wars, with, for instance, another study in 2021 showing how few people trusted the Daily Telegraph. Yes, the rightwing media still wield power – but not nearly as much as they would like us to believe. Think of the coverage of Anthony Albanese’s “gaffes”. His campaign could only be derailed by gotcha questions because Labor’s “small target” strategy partly rested on placating News Corp so as to avoid even the hint of controversy. Hence Albanese’s willingness to endure the Daily Telegraph’s humiliating pop quizzes about his wokeness or lack thereof. By refusing to fight for an agenda of its own, Labor’s allowed the media to set the terms of debate. It didn’t have to be like that. When Adam Bandt snapped “Google it, mate” at a reporter trying to catch him out on statistics, the answer resonated with a public disdainful of stunts and shenanigans. Likewise, when pundits attacked Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, he simply attacked them back, consciously cultivating hostility from a deeply unpopular media class on the basis it would boost his own stocks. In Victoria, Dan Andrews developed a different strategy with the lengthy press conferences he staged during the pandemic. The aggressive questioning Andrews received did not dent his standing; on the contrary, live footage of journalists questioning him won the premier considerable sympathy. Even in the past, the conservative media has often proved impotent against those prepared to take it on. In 1856, the stonemasons’ “useless perambulations” meant that Australian workers enjoyed the eight-hour day long before most comparable countries. The anti-war campaigners forced the government to withdraw from the cruel war in Vietnam; the gay rights movement grew and grew and grew, with the SMH eventually apologising for its coverage. Today, Jack Waterford correctly describes the Murdoch media as a “paper tiger”, noting that its titles failed, despite concerted campaigning, to swing the vote in elections in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. He adds: “They often fail to set the agenda as well. It appeared, for example, that the moral panic about African gangs – supposed to have made every Melburnian afraid to go out at night – caused a backlash – making many voters disgusted at the thinly disguised racial basis of the campaign and swinging instead to Labor. At the height of the Dictator Dan disturbances, with the Herald Sun (and the Australian) virtually inciting an uprising against Melbourne’s lockdown, the popularity of the premier, Daniel Andrews, seemed to actually increase.” Mind you, paper tigers may as well be real if we cower under our beds in fear of them. Obviously, it’s a good thing that so many people feel passionate about improving the media. We can and should demand a different approach. At the same time, progressives can’t use the media as an alibi for our own failures. The best reporting in the world won’t change society for us. If we want to win, we have to actually fight.

4/21/2022,"The National party’s candidate for the marginal northern New South Wales seat of Richmond told worshippers at a Pentecostal church that her “ultimate goal” in politics was to “bring God’s kingdom to the political arena”. The comments by the endorsed Nationals candidate, Kimberly Hone, have emerged alongside a series of old social media posts described by her opponents as “repulsive”, and include a post with a broken Facebook link from 2017 that says “one way to avoid domestic violence is to marry well”. Hone’s past Twitter posts include articles that describe transgender surgery as “mutilation”; articles questioning the parenting abilities of lesbian couples; articles that question human-made global heating; and claims in 2014 that “integration has failed”. Hone appears to have deleted dozens of detailed blogs and videos on these same issues, but some Twitter posts remain online. On the National party’s website, Hone is described as “the mother of three young girls and a small businesswoman”. The profile does not mention the enterprise she runs with her husband is a “ministry” that advises Christians in business, or her previous work as a chaplain and a church youth leader. Guardian Australia has spoken to local Nationals members who said they only recently became aware of Hone’s conservative religious views and her past involvement with minor political parties in Queensland, including a period as a state office-bearer of the defunct Family First party. She has also previously supported the rightwing Australian Conservatives. Historical social media posts show Hone seeking to contact people who were “passionate about making an impact in government” and “taking the political mountain for Jesus”. A YouTube video of Hone speaking at the Living Waters Pentecostal church in the electorate last year shows her telling worshippers: “I’m so glad that you don’t trust your government any more”. “I’m so glad that you are worried about the vaccination, that you no longer trust medical science, because you are asking questions about what happens after death,” she said. “The public are asking these great questions. The harvest is ready. I’m having amazing conversations with people, even in the political arena, who have been working on government places for decades and all of a sudden they don’t like the government. They don’t know what they’re doing there. This is a great place. “How do we bring God’s kingdom to the political arena? How do we change the mountain, from the inside out, not the outside in. “The ultimate goal for me is … I want to bring God’s kingdom to the political arena. And I want God’s kingdom to penetrate the political mountain.” On Wednesday, Hone told Guardian Australia: “My motivation in running for parliament is to represent the best interests of the people of the Richmond electorate, and any suggestion otherwise is absurd. “There is nothing wrong with being a Christian and running for parliament. I stand by my faith and I ask that be respected, as I respect the beliefs of others.” Party members say they have written to federal leader Barnaby Joyce to complain that Hone’s anti-government comments reflect poorly on the Nationals, who have been part of the government for nine years. They also claim Hone’s views are “out of step” with most local branch members and the local community, and that they believe the candidate had not been upfront about her underlying motivations when seeking preselection. Richmond was once National and Country party heartland – an agricultural area represented by three generations of the Anthony family for more than 50 years. But the seat, which is centred on Tweed Heads, Byron Bay, Ballina and the hinterland, has become very socially progressive in recent decades. The outgoing NSW Liberal MP Catherine Cusack, who lives in the area, this week endorsed the Greens candidate for Richmond, Mandy Nolan. Cusack told the Guardian that Hone’s candidacy is indicative of the way elements of the Christian right had been able to gain a foothold in the National and Liberal parties in recent years. “These people are a wrecking ball through the Liberal and National parties,” Cusack said. “They destroy moderates who cross the floor, they destroy trans people, and they do it in the name of God. It’s so destructive. It’s not liberal values, but it’s also not Australian values. “This would be the last electorate where those sort of views would work.” The Labor MP Justine Elliot has condemned Hone’s posts as “repulsive” and “deeply offensive”. Elliot holds the seat by about 4% from the Nationals. But her strongest challenge at the upcoming election could come from Nolan, who is running for the Greens. Nolan said the region was inclusive and celebrated diversity. “The people of the northern rivers deserve someone who is guided by science and compassion.”",News/Australia news,NSW Nationals candidate tells congregation of her aim to ‘bring God’s kingdom’ to politics,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/nsw-nationals-candidate-tells-congregation-of-her-aim-to-bring-gods-kingdom-to-politics
4/21/2022,"The aged care sector has questioned the Coalition’s claims that the home care workforce has increased by almost 15% in a matter of months, saying the figures appear at odds with the “severe staffing challenges” it is experiencing. Aged care providers have repeatedly warned of the staffing crisis facing the sector, including in critically important home care services, where staffing issues have compromised the ability to provide some forms of support to older Australians in their own home. In response, the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said this week that the home care workforce had actually increased by 15,000, from 115,854 to 130,472, in the five months since November, which would represent a 13% increase to the total workforce. But the peak body for the aged care sector, Leading Age Services Australia, said it had seen no figures reflecting such a significant boost to the home care workforce. “We are not aware of any data that reflects this level of growth in the home care workforce,” its chief executive, Sean Rooney, told the Guardian. “We would be keen to find out more about the figures the minister has quoted and just where these workers are coming from. “Providers report to LASA that they continue to face severe staffing challenges due to the pandemic so it is difficult to see where these workers are coming from.” Asked for more detail about the figures, Colbeck’s office said they reflected data provided directly to the minister via the My Aged Care weekly reporting system. They reflected an increase in staff from “115,854 from 3 November 2021 to 130,472 to 13 April, 2022”, the spokesperson said. “This figure takes into account workforce fluctuations,” the spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The latest publicly available, official dataset on the home care workforce is the Australian Bureau of Statistics aged care workforce census, conducted in late 2020. It found the total workforce in the Home Care Packages Program (HCPP), designed for more complex care needs, was 80,340. For the Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP), which funds less complex care, the total workforce was 76,096. The combined workforce across both was 156,436, including 123,048 direct care staff. Colbeck’s office said the figure he was using related to HCPP only. The census said that 57% of CHSP providers reported a decrease in volunteer levels and 28% reported a decrease in personal care workers due to the pandemic. The majority of HCPP providers reported no change in staffing levels due to Covid, while 21% reported a decrease, and 18% reported an increase. The issue of aged care staffing is shaping as a significant issue for both parties in the next weeks of the campaign.

The Coalition promised 80,000 new home care packages and $338.5m to expand, train and upskill the aged care workforce in the last budget. Labor has promised nurses in every residential care facility 24/7, significant funding to improve nutrition for aged care residents, and improved transparency and accountability for providers. “Aged care workers are despairing,” Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday. “This is tough work. It’s physically demanding. They [are] faced with circumstances whereby they’re in an aged care home and they have three buzzers going at once. Which person do they go to?” Both major parties have made promises to fund pay rises for the sector and the Coalition has accused Labor of announcing nothing for home care specifically. Aged and Community Services Australia, an industry peak group, says the sector is suffering “a serious workforce shortage”. “Attracting home care and other aged care workers has become even more difficult through the pressures of the past two years,” Acsa’s chief executive, Paul Sadler, told the Guardian this week. In home care, the total number of workers is not the only issue putting strain on the system. Providers have reported huge staff turnover, even while staffing levels remain relatively stable, and continuing low average hours worked per worker.",News/Australia news,Aged care sector questions Coalition claim home care workforce has grown by almost 15%,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/aged-care-sector-questions-coalition-claim-home-care-workforce-has-grown-by-almost-15
4/21/2022,"Almost all of Australia’s fuel supply is imported, leaving the country vulnerable to shortages, a thinktank has warned in a new report accusing the government of not doing enough to reduce and replace demand. As the war in Ukraine puts the global fuel supply in sharp focus, the Australia Institute found that 91% of Australia’s fuel in the 2021 financial year was imported (including 68% imported as refined crude, as well as 71% of the fuel refined here). According to the report, released on Thursday, Australia’s largest suppliers are Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and China. While International Energy Agency (IEA) guidelines require Australia to hold 90 net import days’ worth of fuel, the report said the country only holds 68 IEA days of reserve – and based on average daily consumption over the past year, current stocks are only expected to last 32 days. Though the federal government has promised to meet IEA guidelines by 2026, the report revealed it plans to do this not by increasing reserves, but by including barrels of liquid fuel in transit or on ships docked in foreign ports. During a crisis, the Australia Institute suggested, supply issues could hold up Australia’s fuel elsewhere – as seen with delays to Covid-19 vaccine orders during the pandemic. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “There is no guarantee of these oil supplies reaching Australia within any particular time frame,” the report said. Part of the issue has been the decline in domestic production capacity. In a decade, Australia has gone from 20 operating oil refineries to two. According to the report, Ampol’s Lytton refinery and Viva’s Geelong refinery have capacity to produce less than a quarter of the volume of petroleum products consumed by the country in 2018-19. The report said not enough work had been done to reduce fuel demand. If every passenger vehicle in the nation’s current fleet was a pure electric vehicle, 33% of imported oil could be replaced with domestic electricity; and even if only a quarter were electric, the report said, 8% of total imports would not be needed. Just 0.8% of Australia’s new vehicle sales in 2020 were electric, compared to the global average of 4.2%. “Australia is an international laggard when it comes to fuel efficiency,” the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said in a statement. “Weak fuel standards and an absence of a national electric vehicle policy leave Australia among the least fuel-efficient fleets in the OECD, and far behind the rest of the world in electric vehicle uptake.” Merzian warned that supply for transport fuels is a national security problem. “High petrol prices are already hurting Australians,” he said. “The only long-term solution is getting off oil. This involves increasing fuel efficiency and transitioning to electric vehicles.” The report called for the federal government to release the Liquid Fuel Security Review’s final report, provided to the government at the end of 2019, as well as publishing an electric vehicle strategy, a national energy security strategy, setting targets to ban internal combustion engine passenger vehicles by 2030 and targets for reduction of transport emissions by 2050. In March, a spokesperson for the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said there had been “significant changes to the fuel market both domestically and internationally since the interim liquid fuel security review was compiled”. They also said the government had taken proactive measures to enhance domestic fuel security, including subsidising both refineries until at least mid-2027 and increasing onshore diesel stocks by 40%.",News/Australia news,"More than 90% of Australia’s fuel imported – leaving country vulnerable to shortages, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/over-90-of-australias-fuel-imported-leaving-country-vulnerable-to-shortages-report-says
4/21/2022,"The easing of Covid restrictions in Victoria and New South Wales has been welcomed by industry groups, despite concerns from some epidemiologists that it sends the wrong message at a time daily infections remain high. From Friday, people in both states who live with Covid-19 cases or are deemed close contacts will no longer have to quarantine for seven days, provided they have no symptoms. Instead, they will be required to undertake rapid antigen tests, wear masks while indoors, work from home where possible and avoid high-risk settings such as aged care and hospitals. In Victoria, patrons will no longer need to show proof of their vaccination status to enter hospitality or entertainment venues, and check-in QR codes will no longer be required anywhere. The state also dropped mask requirements in primary schools, early childhood centres, hospitality, retail and events, bringing it largely in line with NSW and Queensland. However, Victoria is keeping vaccination mandates for key workers at this stage, while in NSW it has been lifted for all but aged care and disability workers. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, welcomed the announcements, telling reporters in Adelaide: “They are getting back to normal. Hallelujah.” Industry groups also praised the Victoria and NSW governments, describing the scrapping of the seven-day isolation for household contacts as an enormous relief for businesses severely affected by staff shortages. “The removal of these isolation requirements in NSW and Victoria are an important step on the path towards living with Covid and are an example for the other jurisdictions to follow,” the Australian Retailers Association CEO, Paul Zahra, said in a statement. “We’re one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, and into the third year of this pandemic. The days of overzealous Covid rules are over.” The Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Paul Guerra, said the announcements put “Covid-19 in the rear-view mirror”. Tim Piper from the Australian Industry Group said it was “the next step in us moving closer to a more ‘Covid normal’ situation”. The views among epidemiologists, however, were mixed. Prof Mike Toole from the Burnet Institute said he was disappointed by the announcements, saying daily Covid cases were far too high to justify the changes. “I don’t think it’s been thought through particularly carefully. I don’t think there’s a clear strategy. I don’t know what our objectives are any more,” he told Guardian Australia. “The message that it sends on Friday is basically that it’s all over, the pandemic is in the past tense. And it’s clearly not. Anyone who looks at the numbers knows it’s not in the past.” Toole said Australia currently had one of the world’s highest rates of new cases a day, averaging dozens of deaths daily. “How can you say we’re entering a new phase of the pandemic when we reported 50,966 new cases [on Wednesday]?” he said. “People are still living in the belief that Australia somehow avoided the worst of the pandemic, they don’t seem to mind the fact that more than 4,000 people have died from Covid in less than four months this year. That’s twice as many as the combined number of deaths in 2020 and 2021.” Victoria recorded 14 deaths and 10,628 new infections on Wednesday, while NSW recorded 15 deaths and 15,414 cases. Authorities in both jurisdictions are confident they have passed the peak of the latest Omicron wave. University of Melbourne epidemiologist Prof Nancy Baxter said the further easing of restrictions would mean the country would not be able to reduce its daily case tally before heading into winter. “If we relax all restrictions, what we’re going to find is we have a plateau – a high number of cases on an ongoing basis – that leads to a lot of hospitalisation, significant amount of death and a lot of long Covid,” she told ABC News Breakfast. “That’s what we’re setting ourselves up for by basically wanting to act like it’s 2019.” Australian National University infectious disease expert Prof Peter Collignon, however, did not expect there to be a huge spike in cases because of the changes, citing high vaccination rates and a large proportion of the population having already had the virus. “The vast majority of the Australian population have had a booster already with either the vaccine or a natural infection, so I think from the point of view of hospitalisation and death, it won’t be as bad as I was expecting this winter,” he said. “Will we see cases? Yes, we will. I don’t think we’re going to see another huge peak, though.” Collignon said Australia has reached a new phase in the pandemic, thanks to vaccination uptake, the milder Omicron variant and the availability of new treatments. “Our outlook as far as death and serious disease is concerned is much, much better than it was a year-and-a-half ago, which allows us to change how we react to it,” he said. The head of the epidemiological modelling unit at Monash University, Dr James Trauer, agreed. “These sorts of changes are reasonable and I think the mix is right,” he said, adding that boosting third and fourth vaccine doses should be the primary focus of authorities going forward. “As restrictions come off, we need to have a positive, proactive response around vaccination to make sure we get high coverage, which I think should be done through a health promotion approach and moving away from vaccine mandates.” Trauer also urged governments to think about how they will manage the virus in the long-term. “We’ve got a federal election just around the corner, it’s just the right time to be talking about what sort of sustainable things we can do to invest in public health going forward,” Trauer said. “I was hoping that the pandemic would be a bit of a wake-up call that we really need to have a health system that’s focused on preventive care, that’s focused on marginalised and vulnerable groups and that doesn’t always run right at capacity, which is what we had before the pandemic.” The secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Luke Hilakari, urged workplaces to maintain Covid-safe plans to protect their workforce and encouraged any workers with symptoms to stay at home. “While we might have gone through the peak, we certainly don’t know what’s around the corner, and for some people Covid has had life changing, devastating effects.”",News/Australia news,Epidemiologists split over easing of Covid restrictions in NSW and Victoria,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/epidemiologists-split-over-easing-of-covid-restrictions-in-nsw-and-victoria
