3/22/2022,"If there’s a universal language of pop right now, then Fred Again speaks it fluently, translating ideas into worldwide smash hits for artists such as Ed Sheeran, George Ezra and Charli XCX. Stepping out from the backroom, the south London 28-year-old, born Fred Gibson, is opening a tour built around last year’s one-two punch of Actual Life parts 1 and 2, two personal, sample-heavy solo albums recorded at the encouragement of mentor Brian Eno. “I so appreciate you being here, so please don’t think that I don’t if I don’t say anything,” warns Gibson, hands clasped, early on in the set. He’s a low-key and smiling presence in a brown tracksuit surrounded by synths, keyboards and drum pads. Instead, the communication comes from a screen behind Gibson – videos captured seemingly from his phone, short bursts of text message. The set is described as “a sort of diary from April to December 2020”. Digital intimacy coupled with broad-brush sentimentality is in keeping with Gibson’s production style. The beats may be as polite as meeting an in-law, but on tracks like Kahan (Last Year), the blend of wintry piano and soulful, Auto-Tuned vocal samples are highly affecting. “This is going to super dampen the mood,” says Gibson unconvincingly as the room nevertheless loses its roof. That track, coupled with the crisp stadium house of Blessed Madonna collaboration Marea (We’ve Lost Dancing) directly speak to the isolation of lockdown, and as such the audience response is pitched higher than normal. Couples kiss, lads grasp their mates tightly. Future historians curious about pop’s response to the pandemic could do worse than look here as pop’s imperial producer grapples with loss and lockdown.

3/22/2022,"A 17-month-old girl who died after a dog attack at her home in Blackbrook, St Helens, on Monday has been named by Merseyside police as Bella-Rae Birch. Neighbours have spoken of their shock after the toddler, described as a “beautiful little girl”, died after being mauled by a newly acquired dog. Police were called to an address at 3.50pm on Monday afternoon after a report that Bella-Rae had been attacked in her own home by a dog. The child was taken to hospital where she died from her injuries. Speaking outside the house Supt Steve Brizell said the toddler had lost her life in the “most unimaginably terrible circumstances and our thoughts, first and foremost, are with the family and wider community”. Specialist family liaison officers were providing support, he said. The incident had left “a family and a community grieving and in complete shock”. Brizell said the dog, which has been put down, had been with the family for a week after it had been bought. It will be forensically examined to determine its breed and to establish whether it was permitted under the Dangerous Dogs Act. “We are working to identify all the previous owners of the dog so we can establish its history.” A neighbour, Joanne Foster, said: “She was such a beautiful little girl, toddling about. I’d see the family in passing, just to say hello, and they were always very pleasant.” She said she first saw an ambulance arrive at the house followed by about 10 police vehicles. “I saw them bring the dog out. I couldn’t tell what breed it was but from the back it looked like a staffordshire bull terrier or pit bull.” Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said she got home at about 4.30pm to find the area busy with police. “It is usually very quiet here and safe for children, but when you hear something like this has happened it is so distressing,” the neighbour said. Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed events in Bidston Avenue, or has information about the dog, to come forward. Anyone with information can contact Merseyside police via its social media desk, @MerPolCC, or “Merseyside police contact centre” on Facebook, with reference 22000196837.",News/UK news,Toddler killed in dog attack named as Bella-Rae Birch,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/toddler-st-helens-dog-attack-named-bella-rae-birch
3/22/2022,"Record numbers of UK manufacturers are raising prices as the war in Ukraine gives an added twist to inflationary pressures, the latest snapshot of industry has shown. The employers’ lobby group, the CBI, said 82% of firms were expecting to raise prices in the coming months against just 2% predicting a fall. The balance of 80% in March was up from 77% and the highest since the CBI began asking the question in its industrial trends survey in 1975 – a previous period in which soaring energy costs prompted a surge in the annual inflation rate. Cost pressures have been building on manufacturers for the past year, with the March 2022 balance of 80% up from 20% a year ago. News of the increase in the strains on industry came before Wednesday’s release of the official inflation figures from the Office for National Statistics and the spring statement on the economy from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The CBI called on Sunak to take the opportunity to help energy-intensive companies and consumers struggling with cost of living pressures. Annual inflation stood at 5.5% in January but is expected to be close to 6% in February and to rise further to about 8% in April. The CBI said cost and price pressures were coming at a time when industry’s order books – both for domestic and overseas customers – were strong. Total order books matched the record level seen last November, while export order books were reported to be above normal to the greatest extent in three years. Anna Leach, the CBI deputy chief economist, said: “This survey highlights strong order books and output growth, but the cost pressures facing manufacturers have been amplified by the conflict in Ukraine. “The government must use tomorrow’s spring statement to provide relief to both energy-intensive industries and vulnerable consumers. “To deliver a fundamental reset to UK growth, we need to see significant action to incentivise investment, a key driver of productivity growth and the only way to sustainably increase real wages. A permanent successor to the super deduction will ensure that economic resilience and growth go hand in hand.” Sunak announced the super deduction – a two-year tax break to encourage firms to invest – in his March 2021 budget. It allows firms to offset 130% of capital spending on plant and machinery against profits but the scheme comes to an end next year.",News/Business,Record numbers of UK manufacturers raise prices as Ukraine war hits costs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/uk-manufacturers-prices-ukraine-war-cbi-rishi-sunak-spring-statement
3/22/2022,"The former prime minister David Cameron finally popped out of his shepherd’s hut last week, to inform the world, proudly, that he had been volunteering at his local food co-op, the Chippy Larder, and was about to drive to Poland with supplies they had collected. For now, try to park the fact that refugee services across eastern Europe have repeatedly said that what they lack is cash, and they would much prefer a wire transfer to have-a-go-heroes making pointless journeys with a van full of stuff that Poland already produces. Because the more striking thing was the audacity of Cameron’s volunteering, which was swiftly pointed out by Zarah Sultana MP – food bank use went up by 2,612% while he was prime minister. There are so many ways he could have been socially useful without rubbing our nose in the poverty he had created (he could have volunteered at a dog’s home, for instance, or worked with bees) that this can only be interpreted as trolling. But that is what a lot of life under the coalition and, later, Conservative government felt like: policies that didn’t make sense because they were cruel but not, from a government perspective, even especially thrifty. This would then be followed by a deliberate provocation – Iain Duncan Smith, saying that it was perfectly easy to live on £53 a week, actually; or Lord Freud chiming in to say that food bank use was on the rise because the food was free, and demand for free goods was potentially infinite. Seeing Cameron up to his old nose-thumbing tricks makes me think that causing outrage was one of the tactics all along. That figure – the rise of 2,612% – doesn’t quite tell the whole story, partly because it’s a bit too huge to get your head round, but mainly because the truth is simpler. Before 2010, food banks were not a thing. Food stamps were seen as a peculiar unkindness devised by the Americans, to strip the low-waged of dignity. There were niche experiments with a copycat system in the UK for asylum seekers – where their absolutely meagre benefits were delivered on an Azure card, with which you could buy bread but not, for instance, crayons. But the general principle of social security was that if you couldn’t afford to feed your children or, for that matter, yourself, something had gone wrong. Without a doubt, there were people before 2010 for whom things had gone wrong, who were struggling to put food on the table – the Trussell Trust food distribution charity had been going since 1997. But food banks weren’t an essential element of social security, they were an emergency stopgap for people in very difficult and, crucially, rare circumstances. If one million people had been using them (as they were by 2015), or two-and-a-half million (as they are now), that would, previously, have been understood as the system not working. This, by the way, has been perfectly obvious to all of us, since austerity began. There was no shortage of people who looked at their policy proposals – of cutting benefits, imposing sanctions, bringing in universal credit with its huge time-lags – and joined the dots to say, this will cause real, life-changing, possibly life-threatening hardship. The thing that took us absolutely ages to catch up with, however, was that the hardship wasn’t a bug – it was a feature. So we kept having fresh conniptions about the heartlessness, which they kept stoking with fresh insensitivities, evidently thinking: “When are these doughnuts going to get it? We’re no longer in the business of ‘heart’.” The Tories were much more rational, in a way, than any of their opponents. They were just doing what they do. We were like people whose corner shop had turned into an estate agent, going in every day, yelling that we couldn’t find the sausages. Even knowing all that, even having lived the past decade, I still can’t get over the image – David Cameron, in a food bank, grinning.

3/22/2022,"The Metropolitan police’s ability to tackle corruption is “fundamentally flawed”, the policing inspectorate has found in a damning report into the Daniel Morgan murder. The report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services was ordered after an independent panel criticised the Met for failings over the Morgan murder, where corruption hampered the hunt for the killers of the private eye. Morgan was found dead in 1987 in a pub car park in south London with an axe in his head. No one has been convicted of the murder. The force was accused of “indifference”, despite decades of promises. Thirty-five years on from the murder, the Met had still not learned all the lessons, the inspectorate found. The inspectors found the Met:  Failed to properly supervise more than 100 recruits with criminal convictions or criminal connections, to lessen the risk they may pose. Those convictions include handling stolen goods, possession of drugs, assault and theft.  The Met does not know if those in highly sensitive posts, such as child protection, major crime investigation, and informant handling, are vetted to the right level.  More than 2,000 warrant cards issued to former officers who are now not entitled to hold them are unaccounted for.  Monitoring of IT systems, which helps identify potentially corrupt staff, remains weaker than it should be.  Hundreds of items such as drugs, cash and exhibits are missing, with the arrangements and policies for keeping them safe branded as “dire”. In once case the security code for a store was written on its door at one police station. Matt Parr, HM inspector of constabulary, said: ”Corruption is almost certainly higher than the Met understands.” Parr added: “It is unacceptable that 35 years after Daniel Morgan’s murder, the Metropolitan police has not done enough to ensure its failings from that investigation cannot be repeated. In fact, we found no evidence that someone, somewhere, had adopted the view that this must never happen again. “We found substantial weaknesses in the Met’s approach to tackling police corruption. The Met’s apparent tolerance of these shortcomings suggests a degree of indifference to the risk of corruption. “We have made several recommendations for change. If public confidence in the Metropolitan police is to be improved, they should be among the commissioner’s highest priorities.” The findings from the inspectorate were so serious that several weeks ago the headlines findings were briefed to the home secretary, Met commissioner and London mayor. The panel that looked into Morgan’s murder, set up by the government, reported last year and found the Met to be institutionally corrupt. In part that was because the force was slow to hand over documents requested. HMICFRS concluded the Met was not institutionally corrupt and any hampering of the inquiry was not deliberate. But it was critical.The inspectorate said: “We concluded that, at least until recently, the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] has often shown a reluctance to examine, admit and learn from past mistakes and failures.” “We concluded that the adverse matters …..bore the hallmarks of limited resources allocated to the maintenance of professional standards, professional incompetence, a lack of understanding of important concepts, poor management or genuine error, rather than dishonesty. “We found no evidence of any deliberate or coordinated campaign to intentionally frustrate the panel’s work. It follows that we would not describe the MPS as institutionally corrupt based upon the evidence we have seen.” The inspectorate said the Met had had enough warnings: “There are multiple serious areas of concern, including in relation to the ways in which the MPS responds to allegations of corruption, which must be addressed to secure public confidence in the MPS. “It is essential that the MPS should be more open to criticism and prepared to change where necessary, including by implementing our recommendations. A further failure to do so (without good reason) may well justify the label of institutional corruption in due course.” Reports into potential failings that allowed Wayne Couzens to join the Met are expected later this year. While a serving Met officer, he used police powers to kidnap and murder Sarah Everard in March 2021.",News/UK news,Daniel Morgan murder: damning report condemns Met police,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/daniel-morgan-damning-report-condemns-met-police
3/22/2022,"A group of leading supermarkets, including Asda, Sainsbury’s, and Waitrose, has written to the regional government of Andalucía, warning that plans to allow more strawberry farms near one of Europe’s largest protected wetlands could risk “the reputation and the long-term development of the region”. Last month, rightwing MPs in the southern Spanish region ignored protests from the central government, the EU, Unesco and several ecological groups by voting to “regularise” 1,461 hectares (3610 acres) of land near the Doñana national park. The move – described by WWF Spain as a “mortal blow to the already over-exploited aquifer that gives Doñana life” – means farmers who have sunk illegal wells and built illicit plantations on the land will be able to legitimise their operations. Juan Manuel Moreno, the regional president and a member of the conservative People’s party, has argued the legislation will allow authorities to more closely monitor the water tapping that has been going on for years. But environmentalists disagree – as do some of the huge agri-food companies that buy their strawberries and other red berries from the Huelva and Doñana regions near the protected wetlands. In their letter to Moreno, the companies warn that any attempt to modify a 2014 plan that placed a moratorium on new farms in the area could prove hugely damaging. “The existing special plan is an important tool to ensure more sustainable cultivation at the origin of the supply chain,” they say. “We are concerned that the proposed changes undermine this goal and endanger the Doñana national park.” The letter – which was co-ordinated by WWF Spain and also signed by Tesco, Lidl, Aldi, Morrisons, Spar and the Innocent drinks company – calls on the regional government to “refrain from the proposed modification”. “Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure the sustainability of water and soil management in Doñana in the long term,” write the signatories. “Should this not succeed, we believe that the reputation and the long-term development of the region as a supply area are at risk.” The letter follows a similar call from Spain’s environment minister, who said the move risked damaging Spain’s international reputation, undermining efforts to tackle the climate emergency, and could result in the EU taking costly legal action. “Given the enormous harm, both economic and environmental – not to mention the damage to Spain’s image abroad – I … call on you to abandon this process before the Andalucían parliament, which could prove so damaging for Spain,” Teresa Ribera said in another letter to Moreno in February. “No one should think that we’re going to erode our natural jewels by as much as a millimetre,” Moreno said in January. “We’re going to protect it because that’s what the law tells us to do, and because that’s what we want to do.” Water supplies to Doñana, where marshes, forests and dunes extend across almost 130,000 hectares in the provinces of Huelva, Seville and Cádiz, have declined drastically over the past 30 years because of climate change, farming, mining pollution and marsh drainage. Doñana is visited by millions of migrating birds each year and is also home to a major population of endangered Iberian lynxes. Berries play a huge role in the local economy. Between January and June last year, Huelva’s exports of soft fruit – almost 20% of which are to the UK – were worth €801.3m (£678m).",News/World news,UK supermarkets urge Andalucía against huge strawberry farm expansion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/uk-supermarkets-urge-andalucia-against-huge-strawberry-farm-expansion
3/22/2022,"The four UK nations and the Republic of Ireland are likely to be confirmed as hosts of Euro 2028 in a fortnight after no other countries bid to stage the tournament. A deadline for submissions is set for Wednesday, but barring a late unexpected entry, the UK-Ireland bid will be the only one on the table. This means the process of confirming the hosts can be expedited, with a meeting of Uefa’s executive committee on 7 April providing the opportunity to rubber-stamp the decision. Potential rivals have fallen away after the five nations confirmed interest enthusiastically supported by the tournament organisers, Uefa. Italy is expected to bid for Euro 2032 instead, and a potential Russian bid has been made impossible following the invasion of Ukraine. With Wembley able to host the final, and other matches to be held in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and elsewhere in England, the tournament offers Uefa the closest thing to a guarantee of sold-out stadiums and the chance to recoup money lost to the pandemic. A decision to determine the number of nations competing in 2028, with an increase from 24 countries to 32 deemed likely, will be made by Uefa before the end of the year. The five nations prioritised a bid for Euro 2028 after deciding to drop plans to stage the World Cup in 2030. The UK government had expressed a strong desire to host the World Cup but a feasibility study conducted by the English FA found “many areas of uncertainty” with the proposal. The bid has not been damaged by the disorder that marred last July’s Euro 2020 final at Wembley.

3/22/2022,"The rapper Kid Rock said Donald Trump once asked him for advice about US policy on Islamic State and North Korea. In an interview with the Fox News host Tucker Carlson broadcast on Monday night, the musician also discussed “cancel culture” – claiming to be “uncancelable” – and the coronavirus pandemic. On the latter, referring to Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, he said: “Fuck Fauci.” “You speak for many when you say that,” Carlson answered. Because of his role in the federal response to a pandemic which has killed more than 972,000 in the US, Fauci, 81, has faced threats to his security and that of his family. Kid Rock has described himself, to the Guardian, as “definitely a Republican on fiscal issues and the military, but I lean to the middle on social issues”. “I am no fan of abortion,” he said, “but it’s not up to a man to tell a woman what to do. As an ordained minister I don’t look forward to marrying gay people, but I’m not opposed to it.” He also said he “played Barack Obama’s inauguration [in 2009] even though I didn’t vote for him. I didn’t agree with his policies, but there was an exciting sense of change in the air. That promise hasn’t been fulfilled – the country is more divided than ever.” In the aftermath of the Trump presidency, such judgments have been borne out. Carlson, Kid Rock’s interlocutor on Monday, has emerged as a particularly divisive primetime presence. In a friendly interview timed for the release of a new album – Kid Rock wearing a “We the People” cap, Carlson in V-neck sweater and khakis – the subject turned to the musician’s friendship with Trump. In a famous picture from 2017, the rapper was shown in the Oval Office, behind the Resolute Desk, with Trump, the rock musician Ted Nugent and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential nominee. Palin said she invited the rightwing rockers “because Jesus was booked”. “I was there with [Trump] one day when he ended the caliphate,” Kid Rock, 51 and born Robert Ritchie, told Carlson in reference to US efforts against the Islamic State. “He wanted to put out a tweet … I don’t like to speak out of school. I hope I’m not. But … the tweet was, and I’m paraphrasing, but it’s like, you know, ‘If you ever joined the caliphate, you know, trying to do this, you’re going to be dead.’ “He goes, ‘What do you think?’ [I said] ‘Awesome. I can’t add any better.’ But then it comes out and it’s … reworded and more political, to look politically correct. And just, ‘be afraid’.” He also said he and Trump were once “looking at maps. I’m like, you know, like, ‘Am I supposed to be in on this shit?’ Like I make dirty records sometimes. I do. “‘What do you think we should do about North Korea?’ I’m like, ‘What? I don’t think I’m qualified to answer this.’” In four years in office, Trump both threatened and met with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. No progress was made in ending the US standoff with the nuclear-armed dictator. Some online critics wondered whether Trump really asked Kid Rock what to do about North Korea. But after Kid Rock’s White House visit with Nugent and Palin in 2017, Nugent told the New York Times the group discussed “‘health, fitness, food, rock’n’roll, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, secure borders, the history of the United States, guns, bullets, bows and arrows, North Korea, Russia and a half-dozen other issues”. Speaking to Carlson, Kid Rock also praised Trump for speaking “off the cuff”. “See now, if you watch a Joe Biden interview, and you watch a Trump interview, there’s no comparison. And Trump speaks off the cuff. “I understand what it’s like, sometimes you get it wrong. But I would way rather hear somebody come from here [the heart] and get it wrong once in a while.”",Arts/Music,Kid Rock says Donald Trump sought his advice on North Korea and Islamic State,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/22/kid-rock-donald-trump-north-korea-islamic-state
3/22/2022,"My husband has a big penis and every time we have sex my fourchette tears. We use silicone lubricant (water-based dried up too quickly) and avoid certain positions, to no avail. That is the only advice I have ever found online and I am too embarrassed to ask my GP for help. This has only been a problem with my husband, not previous partners. Is there anything else we can do to avoid injury? It has reduced our sex life greatly, as it makes me nervous to initiate anything – my husband is very understanding and gentle, and we do oral or manual stimulation, but I miss the intimacy of penetrative sex. We have been together almost 10 years and the tearing is getting worse over time. Stop allowing penetration until you can fix this. The tearing and pain will probably get even worse; in fact you may already be suffering from vaginismus, which is where your vagina fails to become open and lubricated in preparation for sex because previous pain has set up a protective reflex. There are a number of options to make your sex life comfortable and pleasurable again. First, do not allow the prospect of discussing your husband’s big penis stop you from getting help. You are not alone; many couples have such a problem and fail to receive help for the same reason. You may need treatment for vaginismus or a course of self-dilation – a good sex therapist can help you with this.
