12/27/2021,"Storm Arwen came hurtling down from the north at the end of November, causing a tsunami of trees to crash to the ground across Scotland, northern England and parts of Wales. Winds of 100mph flattened conifer plantations like dominoes; large country houses lost 250-year-old oaks; and gardeners grieved for uprooted magnolias and rhododendrons. Three people died and more than 9,000 were left without power for more than a week in bitterly cold weather. Phones were down, roads were blocked and people had trees coming through their roofs. “You weren’t going anywhere,” remembers Heather Swift, the Woodland Trust’s Cumbria site manager, who has been assessing the tree damage in the area.  Storm Arwen has brought about dramatic changes in the landscape, but such upheaval also presents an opportunity to increase forest diversity, expand the provision of wildlife-rich dead wood and create more variation within plantations, say experts. “We think they’re disasters, and momentarily they are, but in the grand scheme of things, this is natural,” says Swift. Many compare the damage to the “great storm” of 1987 that ravaged the south-east of England and London when 115mph winds uprooted 15 million trees, except Arwen seems to have attracted less attention, perhaps as it affected less populated parts of the country. “It was similar in terms of scale of damage, the disruption it caused and size of trees that went down,” says Swift. “There have been some mighty fine trees that have gone down, and there was nothing wrong with them. Huge, beautiful oaks just laid flat on their sides.” Estimates suggest that 8 million trees have been affected in Scotland and 4 million in England, although it will take weeks to work out the full extent of the damage. Currently there are no estimates available for Wales. The National Trust is the largest single custodian of ancient and veteran trees in Europe, and for some properties in the north of England, this was the worst storm in 40 years, with an estimated £3m in damage across sites nationally. Staff were left devastated after losing trees and gardens they’d spent whole careers looking after. “To lose so many in such a short period, I think that’s what is so heartbreaking … Trees are just as important to many of our properties as historic buildings and collections,” says John Deakin, head of trees and woodlands at the National Trust. More than 50 trees were uprooted at Bodnant Garden in Conwy, including the tallest redwood in Wales, which stood at 51 metres and was expected to reach double that height. The Wallington estate in Northumberland saw half its veteran trees blown over. Storm Arwen had a disproportionately large impact on trees because it came from the north, rather than the south-west, which is the prevailing wind direction. Trees are adapted to withstand winds piling in off the Atlantic by anchoring their roots in a specific way and putting on wood in particular places. Woodlands also naturally have smaller trees on the south-west so they are more aerodynamic in strong winds, but this means they are ill-prepared when the wind switches direction and they are battered square on. After the 1987 storm (which did come from the south-west) there was a rush to clear away all the fallen trees, but conservationists say the mess left behind transformed our understanding of woodland ecology, highlighting the benefit of diverse, scruffy, open habitats within woodlands. The response to Storm Arwen will be different from the 1987 storm, and as many fallen trees will be left as possible, say conservationists. “It’s now part of our cultural and historical landscape – clearing it all up kind of obliterates the memory of it,” says Swift. She plans to reroute footpaths around some fallen trees, rather than removing them. The National Trust will leave fallen trees if they are not negatively affecting tenants or posing a risk to visitors, seeing the stricken lumber as another chapter in the story of their properties. This could have significant biodiversity benefits. In wild, natural woodland a quarter of wood is dead, but in most managed woodlands this is less than 10% as people clear it away. The aftermath of Storm Arwen is an opportunity to leave dead and decaying wood in situ, creating rich and underserved wildlife habitats as a result. “We really have a history of overgardening, perhaps seeing some of these natural habitats as untidy … We’ll leave as much [dead wood] as we possibly can,” says Deakin. Storm damage creates opportunities to build more structure and diversity into woodlands in a way that might not have happened before, he says. High winds are likely to hit the UK more frequently and with more strength as the climate crisis goes on because warm air holds more moisture which fuels storms, and so these rare events will become more common. Conservationists and foresters are working out how they can reduce the damage when the next storm hits. The National Trust is looking to move towards more natural tree management. Ancient oaks, for example, lower their branches as they age to make themselves more stable. Sometimes people might overplay the need to take limbs off trees from a health and safety perspective, but the risk of being hit by a fallen branch is incredibly low, says Deakin. “Overzealous intervention is not going to do a tree any good at all. It’ll make it more susceptible to many different factors of which storm damage is one.” Many trees that were knocked down were single-species, single-age conifer plantations, which are more vulnerable to storms than native, mixed woodland. “Over the next 50, 100 years, the forests we’re producing now will be much more diverse … They’ll be better adapted for Storm Arwen-type events and more generally climate change,” says Doug Howieson, Scottish Forestry’s head of operational delivery, who has been working with trees since the 1987 storm. The benefits of work being done since Storm Arwen will be seen in decades to come. “The trees that we plant today, we will not see mature, but people in the future will appreciate our work,” says Howieson. In the meantime, forestry and conservation organisations are urging the public to stay away from damaged trees as they can be dangerous.

12/27/2021,"What do you look for in a video game? Excitement? Immersive escapism? A sense of achievement? Or to be reduced to a blubbering mess? My youngest daughter, Sharkie, said I would get all of that from What Remains of Edith Finch. So I leap into the game, not even angry that the title doesn’t have a question mark at the end. The most intense gaming experience I ever had was crying during Final Fantasy VII on the PlayStation. You know the bit I’m referring to, don’t you? Genuinely great things in life make you cry, whether they be movies or songs, first loves or sports-final defeats. Laughing is easy. We laugh every day, even when things aren’t actually funny. But crying takes something special, such as Aeris dying, or Terry Jacks singing Seasons in the Sun, or the finale of Buffy Season 2, or watching Mr Holland’s Opus on a plane when you are drunk.  I cried at all of that, but I never cried at the births of any of my children. I always thought that made me a terrible parent from day one, and this is what is going through my mind as I play Edith Finch, which is about a family whose children all die in strange circumstances. That’s our biggest fear as parents, isn’t it? As we flounder in the ocean of our parental failings, we cling to that one rock: at least we haven’t killed them. And that’s what makes it impossible for me to enjoy this game. That’s not to say I don’t admire many things about it. The individual styles of each death story are beautifully varied, from scenes in heartrending POV to others drawn through a retro Viewmaster. This is art coded on to a constantly changing gaming canvas. I would go as far as to say the section where one of the brothers slowly loses the will to live working in a fish cannery is the most creative video game level I have ever seen. I like the pace, too. Great art cannot be rushed, and here you’re always walking: it’s probably the slowest game I’ve played since Lords of Midnight on the ZX Spectrum. This means I can consume a sliced turkey and cream cheese bagel while I play, the kind of lunch you simply cannot eat while playing Call of Duty. But I can’t escape from the fact that most of the gameplay in What Remains of Edith Finch revolves around kids dying. Kids of all ages. From teenagers hit by storm debris to a baby drowning in a bath. For an angsty middle-aged parent, this is far more upsetting to watch than any claret-ejaculating Mortal Kombat fatality. And it’s all so avoidable! Basically all of the deaths in this game come down to bad parenting. One character dies from food poisoning after eating stuff left lying around. No! I spent so much of my life cleaning out fridges and putting safety locks on cupboards precisely so that didn’t happen. I am that parent who is obsessed with predicting what can go wrong. I put rubber on the edges of every countertop. I made all my kids wear bicycle helmets in the house when they were learning to walk. My children turned me into such a paranoid parenting wreck, they killed off all the wanton joy of being an irresponsible 90s lad. You can’t do anything to save the characters in Edith Finch; you just have to watch their individual tragedies. That’s kind of the point of the story, but for me this is as frustrating as watching Titanic. Actually, it’s worse, because you are not just watching them die, you are unwillingly steering them towards their demise. I have spent 23 years as a parent trying not to get my kids killed. I really don’t want to play a game where I can’t save them. While What Remains of Edith Finch didn’t give me escapism, achievement, immersion, or the emotional release of my own tears, it did make me conduct an extensive health and safety recce of our house and dig out the old bicycle helmets for the kids. Even though they are now aged 15, 17 and 23.",Arts/Games,"As a parent obsessed with my kids’ safety, I have discovered the video game from hell | Dominik Diamond",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/27/as-a-parent-obsessed-with-my-kids-safety-i-have-discovered-the-video-game-from-hell

12/27/2021,"“When all this is over …” These words started so many wistful sentences during Britain’s lockdowns of 2020. They carried the weight of our hopes and fears and grief and loss. When all this is over, we should have a national day of mourning for everyone and everything we’ve lost. When all this is over, we should honour our collective sacrifice by “building back better”. When all this is over, we should have a huge party and celebrate being able to dance and hug and feel free again. But for anyone who still doubted it, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant brings home the difficult truth: the moment isn’t going to come “when all this is over”. The pandemic isn’t like a war, to be survived until the day when peace is made, and we can all exhale and begin picking up the pieces. It’s a new reality that will, at best, gradually fade into the background as the threat recedes and our coping strategies improve.  The problem is that our bodies aren’t designed to cope with this. As Emily and Amelia Nagoski point out in their book Burnout, our stress response is designed to help us run away from lions. It is something we are supposed to move through: it has a beginning, a middle and an end. One reason so many of us struggle with our mental health is that modern life is full of chronic stressors that we can’t run away from, so we get stuck in a constant loop of edginess and fear. And the pandemic is the ultimate chronic stressor. When lockdown was lifted, instead of being told to “stay home”, we were encouraged to “stay alert”. But nobody can stay alert for two years straight, at least not without consequences. I learned this the hard way when I burned out at the end of July. Like many people, I thought I could just plough on through the pandemic and still meet my own wildly unrealistic expectations of myself. In my case, this meant juggling parenthood with writing my first solo book and taking on a new senior leadership role. As it turned out, I was spectacularly wrong. After several months wrestling with anxiety, depression and fatigue, I finally faced up to reality and decided to step away from the new job. It was wrenching, but I just couldn’t ignore the message my body was giving me: I had to slow down. When I went public with my situation in November, I was overwhelmed by the outpouring of supportive messages. It helped me enormously, but also made me a little sad: it seemed to confirm my hunch that so many others were struggling too, yet were no longer seeing those struggles validated in the public discourse. Now, instead of being given space to process our collective trauma and let our minds and bodies heal, we have been plunged into more uncertainty. December is notoriously a month when the pressure to have fun can itself become a source of stress, when family tensions flare and relationships are strained. This year, the weight of expectation to make up for lost celebrations, alongside the risk of spreading the new variant and the prospect of further restrictions, vaccine disagreements and traumatic memories of 2020 are likely to put this on steroids. I’m sure that there are people out there who embraced the summer’s return to normality; who had moments of catharsis and collective joy at festivals or weddings or gatherings, and enough rest and relaxation on summer holidays; who are feeling recharged and ready to deal with whatever the pandemic throws at them. But I’m also sure that I’m not the only one whose experience has been very different. For many clinically vulnerable people, “freedom day” was anything but freeing, with the acceptance of sky-high infection rates making their lives even more restricted and dangerous. Those dealing with poverty or unemployment have faced cuts to universal credit and the tapering of support schemes, with many being pushed into debt. Frontline health and support workers are drained and traumatised. Even for those of us in more privileged positions, the experience of “freedom” may still have been one of fear and uncertainty, bookended by the chaos of the “pingdemic”. Navigating daily life involves new layers of administrative and emotional complexity. Sending children to school entails repeated cycles of cold symptoms, testing and isolation. Travel plans are haunted by the spectre of last-minute cancellations. As a result, many are facing the “Omicron emergency” feeling broken and exhausted, our resilience worn down by two years of unrelenting demands. The country faces a deep mental health crisis, with nearly a quarter of a million people expected to develop PTSD and dramatic rises in anxiety and depression. At least a million adults are suffering with long Covid. In Germany, people struggling with such conditions can apply to go on a “Kur” – three weeks of treatments at a spa. In the UK, where mental health services are stretched to breaking point, you are doing well if you manage to get a phone call. I am incredibly lucky that I had the financial and social safety net to weather my burnout. Even so, I still had days when I doubted whether I would bounce back. I saw with terrifying clarity how easily someone can slip into a downward spiral of unemployment, debt and mental ill-health. I felt angry that we have built a society that allows this. Such times call for leaders with emotional sensitivity, but instead we have the misfortune to be stuck with leaders who are emotionally stunted, too often adding to our pain and fear instead of calming it. Revelations about Downing Street parties prompted a wave of grief and rage from those who felt this made a mockery of their own heartbreaking sacrifices. We have been told it is now our individual responsibility to manage our own Covid risks, even as government decisions fuel those risks in ways we cannot control. Instead of feeling held by something larger, we are constantly being given the message: you’re on your own. So what can we do? We might not be able to deal with our stressors, but we can find ways to deal with our stress, calm our nervous systems and make our bodies feel safer. We can tell ourselves that we’re not alone. Above all, this festive season, we can give ourselves and each other what our government steadfastly refuses to give us: the acknowledgment that we are hurting and doing our best in impossible times; gentleness, patience and kindness; a sense of safety and stability in an unsafe world. We can find refuge in our fundamental connectedness, our belonging to each other and to the Earth. In the words of the Nagoski sisters, “The cure for burnout is not self-care. It is all of us caring for each other.” Christine Berry is a freelance writer and researcher based in Manchester ",Opinion/Opinion,I thought I could plough through the pandemic without burning out.

12/27/2021,"2021 was the year that America’s democracy came under attack from within. Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the election results, a push that culminated in the 6 January assault on the capitol, ultimately failed. But the lies the former president spread about fraud and the integrity of the 2020 results have stuck around in a dangerous way. False claims about the election have moved to the center of the Republican party.  Republican lawmakers have seized on the fears created by those baseless claims and weaponized them into new laws that make it harder to vote. Between January and October, 19 states enacted 33 laws to restrict voting access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. But Republicans haven’t stopped there. There is now a concerted effort to take more partisan control of election administration. Trump is supporting election deniers in their efforts to take control of key offices that control the rules of elections and counting of ballots. That push has elevated fears that Trump is laying the groundwork for another coup in 2024, when supporters in those key roles could help overturn the election results. All of these actions are taking place against the backdrop of the once-per-decade redistricting process, which Republicans dominate in many states. Republicans are taking full advantage of that power, drawing districts that will entrench their control of state legislatures and win congressional seats for the next decade. Joe Biden has described this attack as “the most significant test of our democracy since the civil war.” But Democrats in the US Senate have been unable to pass two bills with significant voting rights protections. Whether or not Biden and Senate Democrats can find a way to get those bills through Congress looms as a major test of his presidency. Here are the ways that voting rights emerged as the most important story in American politics in 2021: When state legislatures convened at the start of 2021, many moved quickly to enact new laws making it harder to cast a ballot. Many of these new measures targeted voting by mail, which a record number of Americans used in 2020. One of the most high profile battles was in Georgia, a state Trump targeted with baseless claims of fraud after a surprising loss to Biden there. Republicans enacted a law that requires voters to provide additional identification information on both absentee ballot request forms and the ballot itself. They also restricted the availability of absentee ballot drop boxes, a popular method of returning ballots in 2020. The law also criminalized providing food and water to people standing in line within 150ft of a polling place. In Florida, Republicans enacted a new law that also restricts the availability of ballot drop boxes, imposes new rules around third-party registration groups, and makes it so voters have to more frequently request absentee ballots. The fight over new voting restrictions exploded in July, when Democrats in the Texas legislature fled the state for several weeks, denying Republicans the quorum they needed to pass new voting restrictions. Republicans eventually succeeded in passing a law that banned 24-hour voting, established regular citizenship checks for voter rolls, made it harder to assist voters , and empowered partisan poll watchers at the polls. A staggering number of Americans continue not to believe the results of the 2020 election. A September CNN poll found 36% of Americans do not believe Biden was the legitimate winner of the election. Trump has fueled that disbelief by continuing to make claims of irregularities that have already been debunked. Republicans in several states continue to call for the “decertification” of elections, something that is legally impossible. Republicans in some places have gone even further, authorizing unusual post-election inquiries into election results. The most high-profile of those reviews was in Arizona, where Republicans hired a firm with no election experience, called Cyber Ninjas, to examine all 2.1m votes cast in Maricopa county, the most populous in the state. That monthslong effort, which included a hand count of every single ballot, was widely criticized by election experts, who noted that the firm had shoddy methodology and its leader had embraced conspiracy theories about the election. Ultimately, the Cyber Ninjas effort affirmed Biden’s win in Maricopa county. Republicans elsewhere have embraced similar reviews. In Wisconsin, Republicans in the legislature have hired a former Republican supreme court justice to examine the election, but that effort has been marked by sloppiness and accusations of partisan bias. “This is a grift, to be clear,” Matt Masterson, a former top official at the Department of Homeland Security, who closely works on election administration, said in December. These efforts have been coupled with an even more alarming effort in Republican legislatures to empower lawmakers to alter election results. Lawmakers in seven states, including Michigan, Arizona, Missouri and Nevada, introduced 10 bills this year that would empower them to override or change election results, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Some of the bills would allow partisan lawmakers to outright reject election results, while others would allow for post-election meddling in the vote count. Over the last year, there’s been a surge in election administrators who have left their positions because of threats and harassment. Experts are deeply concerned about that exodus and say that it could make room for more inexperienced, partisan workers to take over the running of elections. Ben Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer, said earlier this month the effort was an attempt to take election administration “from the pros” and give it “to the pols”. Trump has also endorsed several candidates who have embraced the myth of a stolen election to be the secretary of state, the chief election official, in many states. So far, he’s made endorsements in GOP primaries in Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada – all key swing states that could play a determinative role in 2024. At the start of each decade, state lawmakers across the US draw new congressional and state legislative districts. In 2020, Republicans dominated the down-ballot races that determine who gets to control the redistricting process. And this year, they’ve used their power remarkably powerfully. In Texas, where 95% of the state’s population growth was from non-white people, Republicans drew maps blunting the political power of minorities. They drew no new majority-minority districts, instead giving Republicans an advantage at winning the state’s two new congressional seats. Republicans have also moved to shore up their advantage in politically competitive states like North Carolina, Ohio, and Georgia. Democrats are gerrymandering the states where they have power, like Illinois and Maryland, but control the redistricting process in far fewer places than Republicans do. These rigged districts will insulate Republicans from threats to their political power for the next decade. One of the biggest frustrations of the first year of Biden’s presidency has been that Democrats have not been able to pass two key pieces of voting rights legislation through Congress. One bill would set a minimum of access across the country, guaranteeing things like 15 days of early voting, as well as prohibiting partisan gerrymandering. The second bill would re-establish a critical piece of the 1965 Voting Rights Act requiring states where there is repeated evidence of voting discrimination to get voting changes approved by the federal government before they go into effect. There is growing frustration that Biden has not pushed hard enough to get rid of the filibuster, which Republicans have relied on to stall those bills. Democrats have pledged to find a way around the filibuster next year.",News/US news,Democracy under attack: how Republicans led the effort to make it harder to vote,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/27/democracy-under-attack-trump-republicans
12/27/2021,"The government has quietly backtracked on proposals to require every shop, office or factory in England to install at least one electric car charger if they have a large car park, prompting criticism by environmental campaigners. The original plan required every new and existing non-residential building with parking for 20 cars or more to install a charger. However, the Department for Transport (DfT) has now revealed it will only require chargers be installed in new or refurbished commercial premises amid fears over the cost for businesses, according to a response to a consultation.  The move has prompted concern in the car industry and among experts that public charger access will lag behind demand, as sales of electric vehicles accelerate ahead of the 2035 ban on sales of new fossil-fuelled internal combustion engines. A quarter of new cars bought in the UK in November can be plugged in to recharge, according to industry data. Greg Archer, the UK director of Transport & Environment, a campaign group, said: “Car parks are an ideal place for drivers of electric cars without driveways to charge. By failing to require commercial buildings with car parks to install a small number of charge points, the government has missed a simple opportunity to level up the charging available for less affluent drivers who park overnight on the road. “It is inexplicable that a government committed to phasing out conventional cars has failed to follow through and implement its own proposals from more than two years ago, and instead say it needs longer to consider the options.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans last month for a charging point to be required for every new or refurbished residential building from next year amid great fanfare, saying the regulations were “world-leading”. However, the decision to drop the requirement for existing non-residential buildings means the UK could fall behind the EU, which is introducing a rule for existing buildings to install cable routes for chargers after 2025. The government could still introduce more ambitious requirements for existing car parks – such as mandating a minimum number of chargers per parking space. The Office for Zero Emission Vehicles is considering comments on a separate consultation that closed last month on the future of transport regulations. The DfT’s consultation response said it wanted to find “a more tailored approach” for existing non-residential buildings. Despite worries over the financial costs, the cost of about £1,500 for installing a charger point can be recouped within a few years by charging users for electricity. The DfT declined to share the identities of those who objected to the policy on cost grounds. The consultation responses showed the most common objection was a lack of ambition for the number of charging points for larger premises. Only a “small number of respondents raised concerns about who would pay”. The DfT said it would draft an alternative policy. All the large UK supermarket chains, led by Asda, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, have already started installing electric car chargers to try to lure shoppers – who can top up on energy while they shop. A DfT spokesperson said: “We have recently introduced world-leading legislation which requires new homes and non-residential buildings, such as offices and supermarkets, with associated parking to have charge points installed. “This will see the installation of up to 145,000 new charge points across England each year, ensuring consumers are able to buy homes ready for an EV future, and more charge points are available at shops and workplaces. With about 80% of all EV charging happening at home, this is a significant step forward as we accelerate towards our net zero targets and power up the electric revolution.”",News/Environment,Plans in England for car chargers in all commercial car parks quietly rolled back,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/27/plans-in-england-for-car-chargers-in-all-commercial-car-parks-quietly-rolled-back
12/27/2021,"Here’s one to ponder while gazing at another dull and drabby December sky. Can colour affect sporting performance? Tiger Woods certainly thinks so. “I wear red on Sundays because my mom thinks that’s my power colour,” he said, while blasting his way to 15 majors. So does Sir Alex Ferguson, who famously changed Manchester United’s grey kits at half-time during a 1996 defeat to Southampton because, he claimed, his players had struggled to pick each other out. Meanwhile, for more than 15 years a battle has raged in sober journals over whether a red uniform can provide a winning edge – and whether other colours lead to a disadvantage. Newspapers, including the Guardian and New York Times, have also reported on the latest developments with breathless fascination. “Red is the tint for winners,” we wrote in 2005. “When all else is equal, a sporting strip of scarlet is enough to tip the balance.” Our report highlighted a highly influential study in Nature that examined combat sports at the 2004 Olympics and found that across 19 of 29 weight classes in boxing, taekwondo, Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, red had more winners than blue.  According to the academics the colour red had provided a slight yet robust enough advantage to tilt the outcome. Meanwhile in 2008 a separate team of academics made another startling claim: that teams wearing red not only won more titles in English football between 1946 and 2003, but they won more at home and had a higher average league position relative to derby rivals in the same city who wore other colours. There was even a theory to explain this apparent phenomenon, rooted in evolution and culture, and linking red to dominance and a tendency for aggressive behaviour. As the Guardian explained in 2005: “Redness indicates anger, testosterone and male aggression in humans, mandrills and sticklebacks. In experiments, red leg bands have helped ringed birds win a higher place in the pecking order. Red plays a big role in signalling superiority throughout the animal world.” It might sound plausible. Perhaps even enticing. However a new study, Red Shirt Colour Has No Effect on Winning in European Soccer, published in the January 2022 journal of Psychology of Sport and Exercise crashes a large torpedo into the red superiority hypothesis. First researchers reanalysed the original 2008 study on English football and found some of the assumptions and conclusions “flawed”. Then they made a detailed statistical analysis of Premier League results between 1992-2018 to see whether red made a difference in more recent years but found “no evidence for the alternative hypothesis of a colour effect on percentages of home wins, points per game, and average ranking”. That wasn’t all. The academics at the University of San Diego and the German Sport University then looked at matches in Portugal, Germany, Netherlands, France and Italy over the last 20 years. Once again they discovered a team’s kit colour did not significantly impact their expected performance. “Overall with the statistics that we have, it’s a lot more likely that that null hypothesis is true: that there aren’t any colour effects,” explains one of the report’s authors, Dr Philip Furley. “And so it’s about 10 times more likely that across all the data, that there is no colour effect, as opposed to there is a colour effect.” Another of the report’s authors, Nadav Goldschmied, says the findings reflect a wider pattern. “It sounds like a good story, that wearing red can make a difference,” adds Goldschmied, who has tried to find evidence of the effect of red superiority in men’s and women’s NCAA basketball without success. “But it isn’t supported empirically.” That, though, isn’t the end of the matter. A second area of discussion focuses on whether wearing certain colours affects visibility. Intriguingly the theory developed after researchers noticed those wearing blue over white appeared to win more judo bouts at the 2004 Olympics in Athens than would be expected by chance. Their explanation? That those in white stood out more against the background of fans and therefore their movements were more easily detected by opponents. Yet when other researchers looked at judo in the 2004 Games they found no advantage to those wearing blue. Meanwhile a third area of research, examining how umpires unconsciously react to a team’s kit, suggests that teams in black might be penalised more often. The theory is that black is associated with malevolence, and thus professional players wearing the colour are deemed to be more aggressive. And, intriguingly, one major study, looking at 25 seasons of NHL penalty-minute data, appears to back it up. It found that teams wearing black were handed more penalty minutes, while white jerseys were uniquely associated with less aggression in contrast with coloured uniforms. What’s more, for the 10 teams that switched to – or from – black uniforms, the effect was marginally significant as well. Even so, it pays to be cautious here. So many things that go into a referee’s decision in a team sport – from home advantage to the aggression levels of the players themselves – that great care has to be taken into separating those effects. Claudio Gentile would still be Claudio Gentile whether he wore white or black. So would Gary Lineker. So where does all this lead us? As a major review into 33 studies dealing with the link between colour and sporting performance noted last year, there is a “highly ambiguous pattern of results” in this nascent discipline often due to small sample sizes and questionable research methods. However its conclusion is clear: “The current state of affairs leads us to doubt the possible sway uniform colours have over sport performance and subsequently game outcome.” And don’t tell Tiger, but the assumed superiority of red looks dead.",Sport/Sport,Like a red rag to a Tiger: can shirt colours really affect results in sport? | Sean Ingle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/27/like-a-red-rag-to-a-tiger-academics-argue-on-shirt-colour-affecting-results
12/27/2021,"Instead of more medals, more compassion. Instead of extraordinary superheroes, brilliant human beings. Instead of a chest-beating accompaniment to “the best ever” chant, simple expressions of pure joy. What a fascinating year of sport, where what happens on the pitch is now much more connected to what happens off it. And what incredible leadership from sportsmen and women across the world who have gone beyond the traditional boundaries of the sporting world to show us a better way to think, behave and connect. In the Euros Gareth Southgate demonstrated that compassion and care play a central role in high performance, on and off the pitch. He emphasised the importance of ensuring players felt a sense of belonging to the England team as a precondition for delivering their best performance on the field of play, operating at a deeper level than simple team formation and match tactics. He invested as much in those who sat on the bench, those who shared the touchline with him and those who supported the team behind the scenes as he did in those who took to the pitch. And he had no problem reaching out and comforting opponents towards whom he felt instinctive empathy and connection.  The recognition of Simone Biles as Time magazine’s athlete of the year and recipient of the BBC lifetime achievement award in a year when she won fewer medals than ever before in her career signals a significant shift. Are we, at last, starting to see beyond the shallow, short-term glimmer of those round inanimate metallic objects and realising that lasting success might look very different, with greater impact and lasting value far beyond any metal discs? Biles’s courage to step back under the global spotlight in Tokyo and put her own mental and physical health first sent shockwaves round the traditional “win at all costs” sporting world. In perhaps her swiftest and most agile of moves, she undercut our entrenched macho narratives around pain, sacrifice and drive to be the best at all costs and exposed them for what they are – made-up narratives that diminish rather than enhance performance, controlling mantras that constrain rather than inspire athletes. Biles has emboldened those who seek to reset the old heroic language that persists at both grassroots and elite levels of sport. There is much to do to continue to break it down. Eddie Jordan’s much quoted yet nonsensical comments that Lewis Hamilton lost the last race of the F1 season because he had become “too sporting and too nice” showed how easy it remains to perpetuate this shallow approach. If you stop to think for a second about his comment, you realise the inherent contradictions and lack of meaning: is he suggesting that Hamilton was “nasty” for the seven years when he won his championship titles? Did he become nice all season, or was it just during the last lap of the last race of the season? It would be good if we could all pause for a moment and think before repeating any of this sort of nonsense. Hamilton’s integrity in an incredibly difficult and controversial situation should be lauded – it is there, not on the podium, that he offers the most powerful lessons. In other sports we have found further examples of athletes who have played their part in breaking down these old heroic myths. Ben Stokes and Naomi Osaka stepped up to show that they were willing to use their platforms to lead sport in a different direction (and to cope with the inevitable social media drubbing that accompanies such bold, fresh thinking). Their actions also served to highlight the woeful lack of leadership by managers and directors across sporting organisations. I hope those designated leaders will take time to reflect on the potential of sport to lead positive social change, affect attitudes and inspire young people to do more than become “heroes”, and take strides to catch up with these brilliant athletes. The maturity of the next generation of sportsmen and women is as breathtaking as their performances. The unashamed joy that Sky Brown and Emma Raducanu take in their sport regardless of their results resets the foundations in a way that is desperately needed by a sporting world that has been plunging into a credibility crisis, whether through shocking doping, repugnant corruption or simply the latest round of “win at all cost” incidences. There is a striking humanity through sport that this new generation of role models are opening up: their language is different, humility shines through, no more “I’m the best” chanting, no more talk of “crushing opponents” and “destroying the opposition”. Sport has always offered us a way of seeing human possibility played out in the context of multiple challenges and opportunities, hopes and fears, luck and risk, skill and grit. It is a world that we all relate to as we too seek to explore what is possible in our own lives. In one of the most challenging years in memory, it is refreshing to see sportsmen and women offering us fresh thinking, a new approach and a better way to succeed that could serve us all well on and off the field in the years ahead.

12/27/2021,"On the southern Mediterranean coast, nestled in the shadow of the Rock’s sheer limestone cliffs and its tangle of wild olive trees, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX) is quietly preparing for a corporate takeover that could have global consequences for the former naval garrison. Less than half a mile away, next to the blue waters of Gibraltar’s mid-harbour marina, the peninsula’s regulators are reviewing a proposal that would prompt blockchain firm Valereum to buy the exchange in the new year – meaning the British overseas territory could soon host the world’s first integrated bourse, where conventional bonds can be traded alongside major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin.  It is a bold move for a territory of just 33,000 people, where the financial sector – which accounts for roughly a third of Gibraltar’s £2.4bn economy - is overseen by a regulator staffed by 82 employees. If all goes to plan, the enclave could become a global cryptocurrency hub; if the controls set by the small team of regulators fail, it risks reputational damage and ultimately diplomatic sanctions that could threaten its economy. While countries including China and the UK have either banned or openly warned against investments in crypto assets, Gibraltar has bucked the trend, having committed to formally regulating cryptocurrencies in an attempt to future-proof the territory’s status as a financial hub. It comes as Gibraltar struggles to shake off a reputation as a global tax haven, with the government having sued a Spanish newspaper in an attempt to restore its global standing. Albert Isola, Gibraltar’s minister for digital, financial services and public utilities, says that while Gibraltar was a tax haven 20 years ago, the territory has now overhauled its tax and information sharing policies. The introduction of crypto regulation is having a similar effect: rooting out bad actors and providing assurance to investors, he says. “If you wanted to do naughty things in crypto, you wouldn’t be in Gibraltar, because the firms are licensed and regulated, and they aren’t anywhere else in the world,” Isola says. Gibraltar’s regulator has so far approved 14 cryptocurrency and blockchain firms for its licensing scheme, attracting the attention of ex-Sirius Minerals chairman Richard Poulden, who chose Gibraltar for Valereum’s crypto-exchange project. Valereum, he says, is trying to harness a cryptocurrency sector that is worth roughly $3.5tn (£2.6tn) – roughly the combined value of all companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Poulden is the chairman of Valereum, which is based in Gibraltar and focuses on providing technology for linking mainstream conventional currencies such as the pound and the dollar with crypto assets. It will be a major task to overhaul an exchange that is currently staffed by only three employees, and will require a change in Gibraltar’s regulations to govern how crypto is going to be traded on the GSX. But Poulden says his firm is leaning on technology, rather than people, to weed out any bad actors. He says running anti-money laundering checks on cryptocurrencies is “not vastly different from running it on currency from any any other source. And indeed, in some cases, because you can trace back through the blockchain and see exactly where that money has come from, it can actually be substantially easier than trying to find where a block of funds in a bank has come from.” Other countries will be watching closely. Neil Williams, London-based deputy head of complex crime at Reeds Solicitors, ssays: “If it’s a success, you’d certainly think that other jurisdictions would look to follow, because it’s an ever increasing valuable commodity.” However, experts have warned that Gibraltar could face sanctions by countries such as the US if its regulators end up giving legal approval to crypto firms that – even inadvertently – give a pass to money launderers, black market criminals or kleptocrats who prefer the anonymity of crypto assets. It comes amid concern at major global financial regulators, including the Bank of England, over the rapid development of crypto assets and the potential consequences for consumer and investor protection, market integrity, money laundering and the financing of terror groups. “It could enable or facilitate money laundering, sanctions evasion, terrorist financing, so everyone’s wary of that as well,” says Charlie Steele, a partner at forensic accounting firm and consultancy Forensic Risk Alliance and a former US justice department official. “Regulators worldwide, almost all of them really, are approaching it from a position of deep scepticism … so it’s a little outside that strain of thinking for a country to welcome them in to buy a stock exchange.” . A month before Valereum announced its bid for the GSX in October, the head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, declared that as an asset class, crypto was “more like the wild west…rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications”, raising further concerns over the possibility of criminal funds seeping into the mainstream financial system. Lax anti-money laundering (AML) controls have resulted in jurisdictions such as Malta being grey-listed by the world’s money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog (FATF), for lacking basic financial safeguards. It could seriously damage Malta’s economy and has been a stark warning for other countries and territories that might be tempted to let regulations slip. Meanwhile, Singapore has had to U-turn on its approval for the standalone crypto exchange Bitget. It suspended the exchange earlier this month for promoting a digital currency involved in a high-profile dispute over branding, having used an unauthorised image of K-pop band BTS to allegedly maximise its profits. “If this starts to look like everyone ran to Gibraltar to get away from real regulators, it’s going to not go well for them,” Steele warns. If anti-money laundering or sanctions rules are broken or evaded, “there’s lots of things they could do, and lead internationally through the FATF, to make things hard on Gibraltar. You’ll see that the FATF can impose all kinds of measures, which will require its members to put limits on business with that country,” he adds. But Gibraltar insists that it has welcomed crypto firms with its eyes wide open, having consulted on its regulation for the sector for four years before introducing it in 2018, helping it to secure a reputation as “Blockchain Rock”. By filtering through and licensing firms, says Isola, they weed out bad actors. “I don’t understand how there can be any increased risk in Gibraltar, when you can go to any other European country today and run exactly the same business without being supervised, without being licensed, and without being regulated. So how can we be more exposed by regulating them? It’s completely the opposite,” Isola says. He stresses that the country’s regulator has approved applications for only 14 firms over three years, a number that he claims speaks to the rigours of the licensing scheme. “It’s hardly a gold rush,” he says. “The knee-jerk reaction for any commentator when it comes to blockchain-based innovations – particularly when it involves a small jurisdiction like Gibraltar – is ‘Oh my God, risk, alarm and all the rest of it,’” says Tom Keatinge, director of RUSI’s Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies.“I do think it’s very important to understand the capacity of the jurisdiction before jerking knees, and the reason I say that is because of all the small jurisdictions on the planet, the one that has invested the most time and effort in understanding the opportunity posed by blockchain is Gibraltar.” The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission declined to comment on the Valereum deal.",News/Technology,‘Blockchain Rock’: Gibraltar moves to become world’s first cryptocurrency hub,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/27/blockchain-rock-gibraltar-moves-to-become-worlds-first-cryptocurrency-hub
12/27/2021,"Financial markets are poised for a bumpy ride in 2022 in the face of soaring inflationary pressure, rising interest rates and ongoing disruption to international supply chains caused by the Omicron variant of coronavirus, experts have said. Analysts and financial investors said Omicron’s emergence had raised the prospect of a stagflationary start to the new year, with weaker levels of economic growth despite intensifying price pressures in already stretched supply chains. The winter energy crisis will also weigh on Europe’s economies.  “Covid vaccines and treatments will take some of the edge off any social disruption we may face, and while many businesses have learned to trade through the stops and starts of the pandemic, a return of substantial winter restrictions [in the UK] and abroad would be a blow for the global economy,” said Laith Khalaf, the head of investment analysis at AJ Bell. If the pandemic does ease in 2022 as hoped, central banks are expected to raise interest rates or cut back on their multitrillion-dollar quantitative easing bond-buying stimulus programmes to try to rein in inflation. The US Federal Reserve said this month that it anticipated raising borrowing costs three times in 2022, which could spook markets and weaken a recovery that is already expected to slow in 2022. “High inflation has central banks feeling the heat, but by late 2022 we see a very different backdrop, with stagnation a bigger risk than stagflation,” said analysts at the Japanese bank Nomura. Victor Golovtchenko, of the online broker Think Markets, said the US Fed was in the unenviable position of choosing between “persistently high inflation numbers, and persistently overvalued financial markets”. Joost Beaumont, a senior fixed income strategist at the Dutch bank ABN Amro, said the coming year would be choppy for markets as a result. “We expect tighter global financial conditions, in particular from Fed rate hikes and rising US rates to again trigger bouts of volatility in markets.” AJ Bell’s Khalaf said the bond market must face a day of reckoning eventually, unless monetary policy never normalises. “It might be a gradual deflation rather than an explosive rupture, but it does look like a question of when, not if. Long dated government bonds would be most in the firing line, so bond investors could seek to protect themselves by looking to shorter dated bonds, higher yielding markets, and strategic funds that employ a flexible approach,” Khalaf said. The Bank of England is also expected to raise interest rates in 2022, perhaps two or three times, having unexpectedly lifted its main interest rate to 0.25% at its December meeting despite concerns over Omicron. “In a very different modus operandi from the last pandemic resurgence, central banks are now on a firm tightening road,” said George Lagarias, the chief economist at Mazars. “We believe that for 2022, investors should at the very least be prepared for more volatility.” Surging energy prices in Europe and Asia drove inflation higher this year, as supplies struggled to meet demand after the easing of lockdown measures over the summer across advanced economies. Inflation is expected to stay elevated in the short term but could then drop back through the year. Bill Blain, a market strategist and the head of alternative assets at Shard Capital, said investors had not priced in the winter energy crisis that is driving up bills and forcing some factories to suspend work. “Markets are vastly underestimating just what higher power prices are going to do to corporate earnings and growth across the globe,” he said. Europe is particularly vulnerable, while power outages and “industrial dislocation” in China could cause fresh supply chain chaos, Blain added. High-growth but low-profitability tech stocks may fare badly in a world of higher inflation and rising interest rates. The share prices of many of those pandemic winners such as Zoom and Peloton have already fallen back from record highs in 2021. Paul Craig, a portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said extreme growth-oriented stocks may continue to struggle. “We are potentially witnessing the end of the valuation bubble in emerging startups, hyper-growth and companies wearing tech clothing, and it would not be a shock to see more pain going into 2022,” he said. The US economy could stutter if Joe Biden does not get his $1.75tn (£1.31tn) Build Back Better legislation through the Senate, where the Democratic senator Joe Manchin is blocking the package. A slowdown or worse in China could also jolt markets in 2022. “Despite Beijing’s recent shift in policy stance, we expect growth to weaken further in spring 2022 on a worsening property sector, rising costs of the zero-Covid strategy, an export downturn and widespread factory closures before and during the Winter Olympics,” said Nomura, which fears “the worst is yet to come”. “We expect Beijing to take more decisive action to arrest the downward spiral in spring 2022, and growth could bottom out after that,” Nomura added. Weaker growth in the world’s second largest economy could pull commodity prices down. Oxford Economics predict iron ore prices will end 2022 below current levels, while Beijing is expected to press its steel industries to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Higher vaccination rates, particularly in emerging markets, will be crucial to fighting the pandemic and easing supply chain bottlenecks, said Seema Shah, the chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “In 2022, governments in emerging market [EM] countries accelerating the pace of vaccination should become more tolerant of Covid and ease strict containment policies. This means some Covid-driven activity surges for EM still lie ahead, providing a promising opportunity to extend the reopening trade. It also likely implies less frequent factory and port closures,” Shah said. There is also the risk of geopolitical turmoil on the horizon; with Russian troops massing at the Ukraine border, increased tensions between Taiwan and China, and elections in the US and France. Will Hobbs, the chief investment officer at Barclays Wealth and Investments, said: “The straits of Taiwan have been hotting up, as has Ukraine’s border with Russia. Right now, many will argue that the liberal democratic model is the one that looks a little more rickety. Upcoming elections will continue to be nervy affairs for a while yet – US midterms and French presidential elections are the ones to watch in 2022.” Most Wall Street banks have forecast that equities will keep rising in 2022, adding to strong gains in 2020 and 2021. Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, has a positive outlook on stocks for the start of 2022. “Global economic growth is likely to remain above trend for the first half of 2022, monetary policy is still accommodative, even if emergency support measures are being scaled back, and we expect 10% growth in global corporate earnings in the year ahead,” he said. But strategists at Bank of America predicted a slightly negative year, as “there are too many similarities between today and 1999-2000 to ignore.” The UK still stands out as cheap and unloved compared with other markets, said Alex Wright, the portfolio manager of Fidelity’s special situations fund. That could mean further takeover action in the next 12 months, if overseas predators pounce on undervalued UK companies. “UK equities remain significantly undervalued compared to global markets and reasonably valued in absolute terms. This has been reflected in a meaningful uptick in M&A activity, which has been a key contributor to performance for our funds. We are likely to see more bids if valuation discounts compared to overseas companies do not close,” he said. But dangers abound as the new year approaches. “The three main risks lie in a policy mistake causing financial havoc, a disorderly energy transition seeing a surge in selected commodity prices, and a nasty variant escaping vaccine protection,” analysts at Generali Investments said.",News/Business,Global financial markets brace for a bumpy ride in 2022 ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/27/global-financial-markets-brace-for-a-bumpy-ride-in-2022
