A woman identified by social media mourners and South Florida TV stations as Shandell Harris. The 30-year-old Miami woman was on the Michael-Ann Russell Jewish Community Center pool deck for her daughter’s swimming lesson when the child’s stepfather shot Harris dead around 2:12 p.m., Miami-Dade Det.

4/4/2022,"Sen. Roy Blunt said he would oppose Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court. The senator contended that Jackson would view the Constitution ""as a more flexible document."" ""I won't be supporting her, but I'll be joining others in understanding the importance of this moment,"" he said. Sen. Roy Blunt on Sunday said that he would not vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, while at the same time all but conceding that she would receive the necessary votes in the upper chamber to be approved. Blunt — the retiring Missouri Republican who had been seen as a potential swing vote — said during an interview on ABC's ""This Week"" that Jackson was ""certainly qualified, but added that he had concerns about her judicial philosophy. ""I think she's got a great personality ... I think will be a good colleague on the court. But the judicial philosophy seems to be not the philosophy of looking at what the law says and the Constitution says and applying that, but going through some method that allows you to try to look at the Constitution as a more flexible document, and even the law. And there are cases that show that that's her view,"" he told host George Stephanopoulos. He continued: ""I think she's certainly going to be confirmed. I think it will be a high point for the country to see her go on the court and take her unique perspective to the court, but I don't think she's the kind of judge that will really do the kind of work that I think needs to be done by the court."" Blunt last month told Politico that he wanted to support the groundbreaking nomination, but would ultimately make his decision based on judicial temperament. ""My early inclination was: I'd really like to vote for the first Black woman to go on the court,"" Blunt told the publication, but added that his views would come down to her ""view of what the court does and their view of what the law is all about."" While on ""This Week,"" Blunt said that despite his ""no"" vote, he recognized the significance of Jackson's milestone. ""I won't be supporting her, but I'll be joining others in understanding the importance of this moment,"" he told Stephanopoulos. Jackson, who last year was confirmed as a judge on the US District Court for the District of Columbia, was nominated by President Joe Biden to the high court in February after Justice Stephen Breyer announced that he would step down from the Supreme Court at the end of the current term. So far, virtually every Democrat has indicated that they will support Jackson, and with 50 votes, plus the backing of Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the judge is set to be confirmed later this week. Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,"GOP Sen.

4/4/2022,"By Justyna Pawlak and Krisztina Than BUDAPEST (Reuters) -Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban scored a fourth consecutive landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his ambition of a conservative, ""illiberal"" state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's close ties with Moscow. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine had appeared to upend Orban's campaign in recent weeks, forcing him into awkward manouvering to explain decade-old cosy business relations with President Vladimir Putin. But he mounted a successful campaign to persuade his Fidesz party's core electorate that the six-party opposition alliance of Peter Marki-Zay promising to mend ties with the European Union could lead the country into war, an accusation the opposition denied. Surrounded by leading party members, a triumphant Orban, 58, said Sunday's victory came against all odds. ""We have scored a victory so big, that it can be seen even from the Moon,"" he said. ""We have defended Hungary's sovereignty and freedom."" Preliminary results with about 98% of national party list votes counted showed Orban's Fidesz party leading with 53.1% of votes versus 35% for Marki-Zay's opposition alliance. Fidesz was also winning 88 of 106 single-member constituencies. Based on preliminary results, the National Election Office said Fidesz would have 135 seats, a two-thirds majority, and the opposition alliance would have 56 seats. A far-right party called Our Homeland would also make it into parliament, winning 7 seats. His comfortable victory could embolden Orban, 58, in his policy agenda which critics say amounts to a subversion of democratic norms, media freedom and the rights of minorities, particularly gay and lesbian people. Conceding defeat, Marki-Zay, 49, said Fidesz's win was due to what he called its vast propaganda machine, including media dominance. ""I don't want to hide my disappointment, my sadness ... We knew this would be an uneven playing field,"" he said. ""We admit that Fidesz got a huge majority of the votes. But we still dispute whether this election was democratic and free."" The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sent a full-scale election monitoring mission for the vote, only the second such effort in an European Union member state. ONE-PARTY RULE One of Europe's longest-serving leaders, Orban has emerged as a vocal supporter of anti-immigration policies and an opponent of tough energy sanctions against Moscow. Critics say he has sought to cement one-party rule by overhauling the constitution, taking control of a majority of media outlets and rejigging election rules, as well as staffing key government posts with loyalists and rewarding businessmen close to Fidesz with lucrative state contracts. Still, he wins favour with many older, poorer voters in rural areas who espouse his traditional Christian values and with families who benefit from a host of tax breaks and price caps on fuel and some foodstuffs. The election comes at a time when global energy woes and steep labour shortages in the region have fuelled inflation increases throughout central Europe. Consumer price growth reached an almost 15-year high of 8.3% in February in Hungary. Critics say the public perception of the war has been influenced by state-controlled media which have amplified Orban's accusations that an opposition-led government would support sanctions on Russian gas shipments and put Hungary at risk by shipping weapons to Ukraine. With voting under way throughout Hungary, Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, while Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies there with calls for new sanctions against Moscow. Orban has condemned the Russian invasion, which the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"" and has not vetoed any European Union sanctions against Moscow even though he said he did not agree with them. But he has banned any transport of arms to Ukraine via Hungarian territory, facing criticism from his nationalist allies in Poland, and said benefits of close ties with Russia include gas supply security. His victory, however, is a relief for Warsaw's nationalist Law and Justice government which has relied on his backing in Brussels to counter penalties over rule of law breaches.

4/4/2022,"(Reuters) -Satellite images show a 45-foot-long trench dug into the grounds of a Ukrainian church where a mass grave was found this week after Russian forces withdrew from the town of Bucha, a private U.S. company said on Sunday. Reuters journalists who visited Bucha on Saturday saw bodies lying on the streets of the town, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of the capital Kyiv. A mass grave at one church was still open, with hands and feet poking through the red clay heaped on top. Ukraine accused Russian forces on Sunday of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town, one of many recaptured by Ukrainian troops as Russia regrouped for battles in eastern Ukraine. Russia denied the allegations, calling them a ""provocation"" by Ukraine. Maxar Technologies, which collects and publishes satellite imagery of Ukraine, said the first signs of excavation for a mass grave at the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints were seen on March 10. ""More recent coverage on March 31st shows the grave site with an approximately 45-foot-long trench in the southwestern section of the area near the church,"" Maxar said. Reuters could not immediately verify the images. It was not clear if the images disseminated by Maxar were of the same church visited by Reuters journalists on Saturday.
