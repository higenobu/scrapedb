1/14/2022,"In the first chapter of this novel a hit man remarks to himself: “No one realises how much hit men owe to Hollywood scriptwriters.” But how does the author know? The throwaway joke, along with an unashamed obsession with verbally recreating and namechecking the mise-en-scène of streaming TV drama, is typical of the book’s effervescent playfulness. Hervé Le Tellier, after all, is the current president of Oulipo, the French “workshop of potential literature” whose past masters included Raymond Queneau and Georges Perec. And what he has done here would delight his forebears with its paradoxical nature: he has written an Oulipan bestseller, a Prix Goncourt-winning novel that has already shifted a million units on the continent. Each chapter of the book’s first section introduces a different cast member, mainly French or American, in a different novelistic or televisual style (deftly handled in Adriana Hunter’s clever translation). After the hit man, Blake, we meet a writer, Victor Miesel, followed by film editor Lucie, architect André, musician Slimboy, six-year-old Sophie and her pet frog, lawyer Joanna, and mathematicians Adrian and Meredith. Victor’s story is a hilariously deadpan satire on the Parisian literary scene: his two unbestselling novels glory in the titles The Mountains Will Come to Find Us and Failures that Missed the Mark, while he also “translates entertaining English-language bestsellers that reduce literature to the status of a minor art for minors”. (He commences work on a book entitled The Anomaly, because of course he does.)  Other tableaux are by turns amusing and affecting: Slimboy is a Nigerian pop star wondering whether he can come out as gay; David is diagnosed with an aggressive cancer; André and Lucie were once an item but no more. Adrian and Meredith are tipsily flirting at a faculty party at MIT, where “there’s some tequila in the Turing Room, in the cupboard behind the felt pens”. Here is Meredith considering Adrian: “For a statistician, he’s a dreamer. He has green eyes that make him look like a number theorist, even though he has long hair like a game theorist, and wears the Trotskytising small steel-rimmed glasses of a logician and the holey old T-shirts of an algebraist.” It has been a bravura 100 pages of introductions and emotional or comedic complications before the conceptual inciting event happens. Air France flight AF006 from Paris to New York emerges from the turbulence of an unexpected storm to the bafflement of air traffic control, and is redirected to a secret military base. Why? Because it’s exactly the same flight as one that already landed at JFK after emerging from a storm three months ago. Not just the same flight number but the same plane, with the same people on it. And guess what links all the characters we have met so far. There are now two copies of Blake, Victor, Lucie, Joanna, and all the rest – except Adrian and Meredith, who are instead whisked off to consult for the American government on what this might mean, while the interlopers are sequestered in a Hollywood movie hangar. At length the assembled brains trust (you’d cast Jeff Goldblum in a shot) decides that the most likely explanation is that we all live in a simulation. Not like The Matrix, where humans are real but enslaved by machines; instead, we ourselves are nothing more than computer programs, running in some vast simulation overseen by an alien civilisation of unimaginable technological capability. The boffins explain this by reference to Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom’s “Simulation Argument”, though something very similar was a pan-galactic religion known as “The Truth” in Iain M Banks’s sci-fi universe. If it is the truth, though, what does this sudden duplication of an aircraft full of people mean? Maybe it’s a test, characters suppose. How will humanity know if it has failed? As the intelligence and military types argue the toss, the rest of the novel follows the characters as, in different situations, they meet their doppelgangers. Would you share your life with the person who also thinks they are you? Would you claim them as a long-lost twin? Or would they need to disappear? After a suitably ludic ending, we are left with an after-echo, a feat of fiction informed by other fictions. Le Tellier describes a world flattened by the unbearable lightness of representation (where some still remember a time “when too many photos hadn’t yet killed photos”). Does he mean to make a sly case that the great god Netflix has become the default way for us to interpret the world? In any event, it seems fitting that the novel’s screen adaptation rights have already been sold. From TV has The Anomaly arisen; to TV shall it return.

1/14/2022,"Twenty new “pandemic billionaires” have been created in Asia thanks to the international response to Covid-19, while 140 million people across the continent were plunged into poverty as jobs were lost during the pandemic, according to Oxfam. A report by the aid organisation says that by March 2021, profits from the pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and services needed for the Covid response had made 20 people new billionaires as lockdowns and economic stagnation destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of others.  From China, Hong Kong, India and Japan, the new billionaires include Li Jianquan, whose firm, Winner Medical, makes personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers, and Dai Lizhong, whose company, Sansure Biotech, makes Covid-19 tests and diagnostic kits. The total number of billionaires in the Asia-Pacific region grew by almost a third from 803 in March 2020 to 1,087 by November last year, and their collective wealth increased by three-quarters (74%), the report said. The report said the richest 1% owned more wealth than the poorest 90% in the region. Mustafa Talpur, campaigns lead at Oxfam Asia, said: “It is outrageous and highly unacceptable that poor people in Asia [were left at] the mercy of the pandemic facing severe health risks, joblessness, hunger and pushed into poverty – erasing the gains made in decades in the fight against poverty. “While rich and privileged men increase their fortunes and protect their health, Asia’s poorest people, women, low-skilled workers, migrants and other marginalised groups are being hit hardest,” he added. In 2020, an estimated 81m jobs disappeared and loss of working hours pushed a further 22–25 million people into working poverty, according to the International Labour Organization. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific region’s billionaires saw their wealth increase by $1.46tn (£1.06tn), enough to provide a salary of almost $10,000 (£7,300) to all those who lost a job. Covid has claimed more than a million lives in just Asia, and countless more deaths will result from increased poverty and disruptions to health services. The report said women and girls were more likely to have lost jobs or income. Women are also more likely to work in frontline roles, putting them at further risk; in the Asia-Pacific region, women account for more than 70% of healthcare workers and 80% of nurses. In south Asia, people from lower castes do the bulk of sanitation work, often without protective equipment, and face poverty and discrimination that prevent them from accessing health services. The pandemic has exacerbated this, said Oxfam. The wealth gap is set to grow. Credit Suisse forecasts that, by 2025, there will be 42,000 more people worth more than $50m in Asia-Pacific and 99,000 billionaires. The number of millionaires by 2025 is projected to be 15.3 million, a 58% increase on 2020. Both the World Bank and IMF have said that coronavirus will cause a significant increase in global economic inequality. Talpur said: “The political system is protecting the interests of the tiny rich elite. Governments have consistently failed to work for the majority during the pandemic. It was the juncture of global solidarity, but rich countries and big pharmaceutical companies turned away their faces.”",News/Global development,"Covid created 20 new ‘pandemic billionaires’ in Asia, says Oxfam",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/14/covid-created-20-new-pandemic-billionaires-in-asia-says-oxfam
1/14/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s Australian visa has again been cancelled just days before the start of the Australian Open. On Friday, the Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke, exercised a personal power to cancel Djokovic’s visa, likely to result in the world No 1’s deportation and putting him out of contention for the grand slam tournament barring an against-the-odds court victory.  The decision means that Djokovic could be effectively barred from re-entering Australia for three years unless he can show in future bids that compelling circumstances exist, such as compassionate or Australian national interest grounds. In a statement Hawke said he cancelled the visa “on health and good order grounds, [and] on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so”. Hawke brushed off the Australian government’s loss in court on Monday, indicating Djokovic had his visa restored only on “procedural fairness grounds”. Hawke said he had “carefully considered information provided” by Djokovic, his department, and the Australian Border Force. “The Morrison government is firmly committed to protecting Australia’s borders, particularly in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.” The decision follows comments from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday that he expects authorities to apply the policies of the government that non-citizen non-residents must be double vaccinated or have an acceptable medical exemption. Djokovic arrived in Australia on the evening of 5 January. He believed that a visa granted on 18 November and an exemption approved by Tennis Australia’s chief medical officer and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. After late-night questioning at Melbourne airport, Djokovic’s visa was initially cancelled by a delegate of the home affairs minister last Thursday, on the basis a recent Covid infection by itself was not sufficient for an exemption from Australia’s strict vaccination requirements. The delegate concluded that, since he was unvaccinated, Djokovic posed a risk to public health. But on Monday, a federal circuit court judge restored Djokovic’s visa, concluding it was unreasonable for the Australian Border Force to renege on a deal to give him more time at the airport to address the exemption issue. Government lawyers immediately put the world No 1 on notice that the immigration minister could still exercise a personal power to again cancel the visa. Djokovic faced a nervous wait, with questions about his travel in the fortnight before arriving in Australia and attendance at events after his positive Covid diagnosis of 16 December. Der Spiegel also claimed anomalies suggested the positive result could have been negative or dated 26 December. On Wednesday, Djokovic conceded his agent made an “administrative mistake” when declaring he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia and acknowledged an “error of judgment” by not isolating after he tested positive for Covid. The fresh decision to cancel the visa likely leaves the Australian Open without one of its biggest stars and Djokovic – who was seeking a record-breaking 21st grand slam triumph – unable to defend the title he has won nine times.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic: Australia cancels tennis star’s visa ahead of Australian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/novak-djokovic-visa-cancelled-tennis-2022-australian-open-immigration-minister-australia
1/14/2022,"Novak Djokovic has fallen victim to the latest harsh application of border policies by an Australian government, but he still only has himself to blame. On Friday the Morrison government’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, took the momentous decision to again cancel the world No 1’s visa, very likely to trigger deportation despite Djokovic’s win in court on Monday .  Now Djokovic’s only hope would be a second Hail Mary court case, made all the harder by the God-like powers given to the minister in Australian law and a slower, steadier process of decision that has consumed the whole week. When Djokovic landed in Melbourne late on the evening of 5 January, he thought a visa and a medical exemption approved by Tennis Australia’s chief medical officer and an independent Victorian government board would guarantee him a shot at his 10th Australian Open and record 21st grand slam. But his fate was sealed by a hardening view in the Australian government and its Border Force that a recent Covid diagnosis was itself not enough to enter the country quarantine-free, and an error on his immigration paperwork that took days to come to light. Djokovic challenged his visa cancellation in the federal circuit court, winning because the judge agreed it had been unreasonable of Border Force to renege on a deal to give him more time to address the exemption issue. First set Djokovic. He took to Melbourne Park, ensuring familiar images of him on Rod Laver arena’s Avatar-blue court that seemed to promise another shot at grand slam greatness. Even public opinion – so long set against Djokovic for his refusal to be vaccinated to play a tournament in one of the world’s most locked down cities during the pandemic – seemed to swing back his way. Transcripts of his interview with Border Force, released in court documents, painted the picture of a weary traveller who stayed cool and calm despite being genuinely bewildered as he thought he’d done everything right. Or as judge Anthony Kelly put it: what more could this man have done? Accepting the loss on procedural grounds, the government’s lawyer warned the minister was still considering the nuclear option of re-cancelling his visa. Technically, the old ground of possible risk to public health was enough to do so, although it could be construed as a churlish response demonstrating the government was always out to get Djokovic. But momentum swung against Djokovic when it was noted that his presence in Belgrade for Christmas suggested a declaration he hadn’t travelled in the fortnight before his flight to Australia from Spain was wrong, to say nothing of his public appearances in the days after his positive test on 16 December. Djokovic’s Wednesday statement conceded error in his paperwork, blamed an agent who had filled it out, and acknowledged an “error of judgment” attending an interview and photo shoot after he received his result. That statement sealed his fate: giving new impetus to cancel his visa and further harming his public image for exposing others to Covid back in Serbia. The politics of this decision will be mixed. Some will think it an overreaction for a government trying to normalise the inevitability of endemic Covid cases, and Serbian-Australians will be furious. But time and time again Australian governments have been rewarded for keeping people out, and the prime minister’s “rules are rules” refrain last week showed this is where the Coalition thinks the balance of public opinion lies. Yes, the decision is harsh, as most travellers’ declarations are not subjected to this level of scrutiny. Yes, it will have an enormous impact on Djokovic and his quest to be recognised as the greatest male singles player of all time. But still, the judge’s question can now be answered easily enough. What more could Djokovic have done? Get vaccinated; isolate while awaiting the result of a PCR test instead of doing an event with children (even if, as Djokovic claims, he felt fine and rapid antigen tests came back negative); stay in isolation after being notified of a positive result instead of doing an interview and photo shoot; and answer the form correctly. While it seems bizarre that the minuscule risk of one unvaccinated man entering a country overrun by Omicron could justify deportation, harshness – and even cruelty – are the hallmarks and organising principles of Australia’s border policies. The decision was Hawke’s to make, but it’s worth noting Morrison proudly displays an “I Stopped These” trophy of a boat in his office, and once complained the relatives of deceased asylum seekers received taxpayer funded flights to attend their funerals. Donald Trump remarked to another Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, “you are worse than I am”, intending it as a compliment on Australia’s refugee policies. A system that crushes the hopes and dreams of refugees and asylum seekers who did nothing except seek safety in Australia was always going to be able to find a way to crush those of a man who has hit plenty of unforced errors.",Opinion/Opinion,"What more could Novak Djokovic have done?

1/14/2022,"Somebody Somewhere, a spiky and endearing seven-part HBO series created by and starring the comedian, actor and singer Bridget Everett, begins in the quiet aftermath of loss. Sam, a 40-something woman played by Everett, is struggling to adjust to life in her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas (also Everett’s hometown), where she returned a year prior to take care of her beloved sister Holly during an illness.  Six months after her death, Sam works as an unenthusiastic grader of standardized tests and sleeps on Holly’s couch; she still can’t bring herself to touch Holly’s bed. Sam is a void, turned inward and speaking little, a fuck-up to everyone other than a sympathetic coworker and former high school classmate, Joel (Jeff Hiller), who remembers her as a “big fucking deal” in their show choir days (hence the BFD title of the first episode, written by Patricia Breen and directed by executive producer Jay Duplass). Quiet is not how one would describe Everett, a fixture on the New York comedy scene as a bawdy, thunderous performer of alternative cabaret (signature ribald songs include titties, what I gotta do to get that dick in my mouth? and keep it in your pants song). HBO has billed Somebody Somewhere as a “coming-of-middle-age” story and that’s pretty accurate – both for Sam, reeling from the loss of the only person who seems to have understood her, and for the 49-year-old Everett, in her first leading series role after years of bit parts (perhaps most famously on Inside Amy Schumer). Everett’s stage persona is larger than life – her operatic voice, her libido, her body and especially her boobs, with which she has been known to motorboat audience members. Sam, by contrast, is a repressed, unconfident alter ego of the brash performer, a fictionalized vision of what might be, had Everett not left the “Little Apple” for the big one, or was tampered down instead of emboldened. Sam lumbers between her snooty sister Tricia’s (Mary Catherine Garrison) house and her parents’ farm, stuck and unsure, dressed down in oversized clothes, alone. She is a singer at heart and the author of Everett’s own dirty songs, but afraid of the grief music will expose. Sensing her potential, Joel, a gay Christian with his own complicated relationship to his hometown, invites Sam to his “choir practice” – a deceptively titled celebration of music and queerness and a haven for the town’s misfits. The first episode’s climactic scene, as with half the episodes of the series, is a moving musical number: Sam, with Joel’s coaxing, embraces the stage for the first time in years. The moment, played to convincingly high stakes by both Everett and Hiller, cements the two central romances of the series: Sam’s re-embrace of singing, and thus her more honest self, and the tender, tart, altogether winning friendship between her and Joel at an age when most adults seem to eschew making new platonic confidantes. Both relationships are a joy to watch blossom, even if they’re not always the most exciting. One’s enjoyment of Somebody Somewhere depends somewhat on your threshold for backseat plot – there are buried resentments and secrets, tense conversations and occasional blowups, but little external conflict or antagonism. For the most part, everyone on the show (even Tricia) is a good person at heart doing their best, trying to communicate and making small realizations along the way. Though filmed in Illinois, the show’s many interstitial shots of cornfields and a cutesy college town street (Manhattan is home to Kansas State University) effectively conjures a midwestern town: warmhearted, a little sleepy, unassuming and full of characters if you know where to look, such as Sam and Joel’s friend Fred Rococo, the master of choir practice ceremonies played by the New York drag king, Murray Hill. The main draw, though, is Everett, whom I would watch do anything after imbuing Sam with this much bruised charisma. For all her walls, which Everett never lets us believe are anything but shaky and ill-fitting, Sam has an undeniable and magnetic maternal side – not in the sense of literally having kids, whose absence leaves Sam feeling judged by her town’s faith and family milieu, but in caring for others. She is a disarming, unvarnished support for her teenage niece Shannon (Kailey Albus), the person who convinces her father Ed (an excellent Mike Hagerty) to convince her alcoholic mother Mary Jo (Jane Brody) to give rehab a try. When she lashes out at Joel after a particularly painful afternoon at the receiving end of Tricia’s judgments, it only takes a day for her to make amends with self-effacing vulnerability. “I don’t think I’m really friend material,” she says. Joel disagrees, as do I. Welcoming Sam – wounded and warm, subdued and obnoxious, finally open to new friends – into your life for seven half-hour chapters is a breeze, as natural as Sam’s final command of the karaoke mic.

1/14/2022,"Munich, based on the Robert Harris novel, is a German-British TV production that was filmed in Germany and subsequently in England in late 2020. I was invited to join the crew as an on-set stills photographer for the UK leg of shooting. We started in Liverpool, which was doubling for 1930s London. The historic Liver Building, which stood in for Gotham city in the forthcoming Batman movie, made a very convincing Whitehall. The production later moved south to Amersham in Buckinghamshire where we shot in historic houses used as sets for Chequers and Downing Street.  Liverpool doubled for 1930s London – with the historic Liver Building making an impressive substitute for Whitehall George MacKay running down ‘Whitehall’ [the side of the Liver Building. The camera is ahead of him on a makeshift tricycle George MacKay makes sure his young co-star feels at ease director Christian Schwochow gives notes to actors At this point in the pandemic, England was in tier four, which made for a strange but fascinating experience. After months shielding in London and seeing barely anyone, it was overwhelming to be near so many other people. Overwhelming and at times bizarre when, after so much isolation, I’d suddenly find myself surrounded by more than 100 masked supporting artists in immaculate 30s period dress. Extras at the Downing Street set at Elstree Studios. This set is also used, with slight period modifications, for The Crown. Right: extras on set at Elstree The streets of Liverpool were almost entirely deserted, which meant that the period details, classic cars and authentic costumes made for a convincing illusion. Classic cars correct to the period are rare. Their owners tend to ‘play’ the drivers in period productions and the cars move between all sorts of film and TV sets. They aren’t always reliable, though (unsurprising for cars nearly 100 years old) and the odd scene was held up as the drivers did some quick mechanical repairs A large scene in Liverpool with a snagged barrage balloon. Most of the effect was done with a huge model, but there will be embellishments added inpostproduction Supporting artist ‘waiters’ watch the barrage balloon Part of the budget for the production went into Covid protection,now standard on all film and television productions. We formed a giant bubble. Lateral flow tests were administered every other day. PCR tests every three days. Masks were worn and monitors – the so-called “Covid police” – checked that everyone was maintaining protocols and distance. Covid-secure extras playing Conservative MPs in the House of Commons Extras waiting for an elaborate dining scene to start Extras wait outside in masks on the Liverpool set The cast, principal actors, and all extras wore masks on set until the final rehearsal and during takes, after which face coverings went back on. Windows and doors were wide open everywhere. Extras in Liverpool giving the sense that Britain knew war was coming The film’s action is mainly set in late summer and early September but we were filming in an unusually cold, frosty late November and December. The interiors were as cold as the exteriors. One particularly frigid day, in a country house with huge open windows and doors, a “creative” decision was made, partly by the poor actors in their 30s suits (with crew in North Facethermals) to the effect that Prime Minister Chamberlain would have had an open fire roaring during his early September cabinet meeting. Jeremy Irons between scenes set in Downing Street The protocols worked and other than the odd heart-stopping false positive lateral flow test, there were no actual cases of Covid during the British leg of filming, despite the large numbers of people involved in some scenes. The strangest part was what the Covid precautions did to the camaraderie of the production.. For Munich, we routinely worked 10- or 11-hour days as part of a tight crew but then went back to the hotel to eat alone in our rooms. Supporting artists playing MPs queueing for their Covid-secure lunches while protecting their immaculate costumes Even so, it was thrilling to be part of such a large creative group. As the stills photographer I was with the camera department. All of the active camera crew were German, working under director of photography Frank Lamm. Usually, scenes were shot with two cameras, an “A” and a “B” device. For larger scenes, there were up to four cameras, each one accompanied by a focus puller, a microphone boom holder and a grip to make sure cables were clear . The A camera crew with cinematographer Frank Lamm seated. First assistant director Finn McGrath. The first AD is one of the most important people on set, making sure every scene is running to time and that everyone is exactly where they should be so that the director and cast can have the right space and atmosphere to do their work As a stills photographer, I would often try to shoot during rehearsals before each take, but this wasn’t always possible. Actors like to have the set clear and quiet, the better to communicate with the director. That meant for much of the filming I was shooting during the actual take. This entailed trying to fit myself as unobtrusively, respectfully and noiselessly as possible into a space near the camera so as not to be in shot. This meant keeping to the right side of the boom holder so I could crouch next to their chest [their work means they have their arms above their head and are close to the actors. It’s a good spot but a very tight one and, as the stills photographer, I had to remember I was the least important part of any take. If I messedup, got in someone’s way, or distracted an actor, the I’d be the the easiest person to kick off the set. George MacKay and Jessica Brown-Findlay George MacKay, and right; Jessica Brown-Findlay as Pamela Legat Aidan Hennessy playing a young Arthur Legat, and George MacKay. George MacKay in a scene where his voice was needed for another actor’s shot but he didn’t need to be on camera. He decided to hide behind a desk so he could give the other actor what they needed but remain out of shot. I enjoy the challenge of getting the balance between being pushy enough to edge close to the action I want to photograph while being discreet and diplomatic enough to be allowed to do this by the rest of the crew. Director Christian Schwochow and George MacKay Jessica Brown-Findlay playing Pamela Legat, George MacKay as Hugh Legat and Abigail Cruttenden as Anne Chamberlain chatting during a break between takes There was one big challenge of working with the German camera crew. While they were incredibly welcoming, Frank and the other cinematographer, Niv, operating camera B, along with German director Christian, tended to make very quick decisions, often after the rehearsal, about what the shot would look like. They spoke in German, meaning we non-German-speaking members of the crew had to try to work out where was safe to stand. The nightmare would be being standing in some actor’s way or, God forbid, ruining a whole take by ending up in shot. A scene in what was supposed to be the Downing Street garden in late summer. It was actually -1C with a thick fog and heavy frost. Gardeners from the crew had planted summer flowers and roses and Frank used an exceptionally powerful light high on a crane to replicate the afternoon summer sun The effect was a remarkable trompe l’oeil. It was incredibly cold and uncomfortable for the actors spending hour after hour in their light, seasonally inappropriate costumes The closest I came to disrupting a scene was when we were filming in the freezing fog trying to shoot a late-summer, Downing Street garden scene. I misunderstood the German and nearly found myself directly under Jeremy Irons’s feet. I threw myself under a rhododendron bush and just about got away with it. The producer of Munich, Andrew Eaton, was also the original producer of The Crown and there are similarities in the attention to period detail and the degree of veracity achieved with props and costumes. Particularly in scenes set in the secretaries’ offices under Whitehall (filmed in an imposing and deserted bank in central Liverpool). Anjli Mohindra playing Joan Menzies in the elaborate sets representing the Downing Street secretary pool In restaurant scenes, there were real chefs providing period-correct meals for the extras to pretend to eat. Likewise, the newspapers they were reading were all perfect reproductions, as were the period posters. I walked on the set when everyone had broken for lunch and, apart from the odd piece of gaffer tape and the lingering foul smell of theatrical herbal cigarettes, the illusion was total. One really could have been in a 30s government office. Every letter on every desk was addressed and franked realistically. The stationery in drawers was correct to the period. The calendars on desks were set to the correct date. It’s remarkable how much work goes in to this just to create a convincing and absorbing recreation – so that the actors and audience “feel” it. Truly remarkable. George MacKay in Rochester town hall, which was used as the Palace of Westminster The production used Rochester town hall, a building chosen by Hitler to be shipped to Germany brick by brick in the event of a successful Nazi invasion of Britain, as a substitute for the Palace of Westminster. Rows of green benches full of picture-perfect supporting artists were dressed and made up to be the MPs on the Tory benches, augmented with green screens that would help the visual FX team insert the rest of the famous chamber. At the wrap on the last day of filming, I shot the camera crew with signs from the prop department on the steps of No 10 I’m not often on film sets, but I always love it when I am. To be involved with a production of this size during the extreme strangeness of a pandemic made it all the more memorable.",Arts/Film,Behind the scenes of Munich: The Edge of War – in pictures,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/14/behind-the-scenes-of-munich-the-edge-of-war-in-pictures
1/14/2022,"Amitav Ghosh can clearly remember his first interaction with the climate crisis. It was the early 2000s, and Ghosh, now one of India’s most celebrated authors and winner of its highest literary prize, was researching a novel set in the Sundarbans, a network of islands around the mouth of the Ganges Delta in the Bay of Bengal, which is home to the world’s largest mangrove forest. Climate change had barely entered into public consciousness back then, but Ghosh clearly remembers “visible signs that something wasn’t right”.  “People spoke of their homes disappearing, of sea water levels rising and salt water erosion, but no one knew what was happening,” he said. “So I began researching. And as the years went on the signs became clearer and clearer.” Twenty years on, the Sundarbans are widely acknowledged to be one of the world’s most vulnerable areas to the climate crisis. Rising sea levels are eating away at the islands while extreme weather events have decimated the ecology and made the land salty and arid. Drilling for groundwater has only exacerbated the problem as it causes the islands to sink faster. Some predict that in less than a century, the unique biosphere will disappear entirely. Ghosh, who was born in Kolkata in West Bengal, less than 100 miles from the Sundarbans, never forgot the rapidly changing landscape he witnessed and has become one of the most vocal literary voices calling for the world to pay attention to the climate emergency. While he is still known best for his novels, most notably the Booker-prize nominated Ibis trilogy about the opium trade in the 1800s, it was to a “planet in crisis” that Ghosh turned his attention in his latest work of nonfiction, The Nutmeg’s Curse. Spanning horrific incidents of European settler colonial violence carried out across Asia, America, Australia, New Zealand and Africa, Ghosh maps out how the pillaging of those lands hundreds of years ago – and the systematic extermination of their indigenous people – laid the foundation for the climate crisis that threatens the world today. “Why has this crisis come about?” said Ghosh. “Because for two centuries, European colonists tore across the world, viewing nature and land as something inert to be conquered and consumed without limits and the indigenous people as savages whose knowledge of nature was worthless and who needed to be erased. It was this settler colonial worldview – of just accumulate, accumulate, accumulate, consume, consume, consume – that has got us where we are now.” Yet as Ghosh sat down to write the book in March 2020, he had no idea that the ideas that had begun to take shape in his head would begin to manifest so dramatically off the page. Suddenly the pandemic hit and New York, where he lives, was one of its hardest-hit cities. “That experience really shaped the book, because the pandemic is the most visible aspect of the planetary crisis that’s unfolding us around us,” said Ghosh. “I think the pandemic more than anything else made it perfectly clear that this is a crisis you can’t hide from. Money will not protect you, power will not protect you, we’re in the midst of it already. It gave it a terrific sense of urgency.” For Ghosh, the survival of our planet hinges on returning to interacting with Earth as a living being to be listened to, understood and respected. “The indigenous peoples of the Americas have been saying for decades that our past is your future and now that’s exactly what’s proving to be the case,” he said. There are signs this perception of nature is becoming more formally recognised and non-human voices are starting to be heard. Courts in countries such as New Zealand, once home to atrocious acts of violence by European colonialists, have begun to recognise the personhood and rights of rivers, mountains, glaciers and other geological phenomena. “This is one of the things that makes me hopeful because if it happens in legal language then at some point it’s bound to seep also into political language,” said Ghosh. But he also sees some developing countries, including India, reverting to the very same approaches of greed, consumption and extraction, and alienation of indigenous communities, that were inflicted by colonial invaders 200 years ago. “In India especially, governing elites have completely accepted the settler colonial models, and are now trying to impose them upon indigenous forest dwellers, adivasis,” said Ghosh. He pointed out that the Indian government was auctioning off sites for private coalmines, many in rich biodiverse forests with tribal communities. “They talk about environmentalism, development and progress but it only serves a middle-class, urban vision of the world,” he said. “Meanwhile, those who live off the land are made to suffer. It can only have disastrous consequences for the future of our planet.” Ghosh said this disconnect was worsened by India’s caste system, where adivasis are seen to be at the very lowest rung of society. “Indian environmentalism has tended to be very upper-caste oriented,” he said. “They have these visions of nature as pure and pristine and these adivasis are somehow contaminants of the forests.” According to Ghosh, there is still hope left in the fight against the climate crisis, but it is not a hope represented by large multinational bodies and institutions. Cop26 only proved his worst fears. “Cop26 really underlined that all those political mechanisms and institutions of liberal world governance that we rely on have failed us, and they’re going to fail more and more in the future,” said Ghosh. His hope for the planet lies instead in movements such as Black Lives Matter, the Standing Rock protests and Occupy, where the colonialist viewpoints that have infused society for hundreds of years finally began to be challenged and the power and potential of global connectivity was felt. As Ghosh writes in the final lines of the book, it is not of billionaires or technology that will save us, but instead a “vitalist mass movement”, driven by human spirit, that “may actually be magical enough to change hearts and minds across the world”.",Arts/Books, Amitav Ghosh: European colonialism helped create a planet in crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/14/amitav-ghosh-european-colonialism-helped-create-a-planet-in-crisis

I first came across Burgh by Sands – a mile up the road from this walk’s starting point in Monkhill – in a 1970s magazine devoted to paranormal phenomena. In 1964, a Carlisle fireman named Jim Templeton took a photo of his daughter Elizabeth near Burgh (pronounced to rhyme with rough) only to find that, when he developed it, a strange figure in a spacesuit and helmet had mysteriously materialised behind her. The Solway Spaceman looked like a Doctor Who Cyberman and generated headlines around the globe, though most experts these days think it was just an over-exposed image of Jim’s wife, Annie. That the marshlands of the English Solway should be the site of such a weird, Fortean event doesn’t seem all that surprising when you’re standing on one of the narrow wooden footbridges that span the deep tidal dykes, looking north across the wide, glimmering water. The Solway is a landscape of eerie, wind-blasted beauty. The light has a pale, ethereal brightness and the silence is so dense the ping of a phone alert echoes over the murky green flats like the toll of a church bell, sending flocks of sandpipers and golden plovers into panicked flight. Inspired by the strangeness, local Anglo-Saxons decorated a wall of St Michael’s Church in Burgh by Sands with carvings of magical beasts. The Solway Spaceman is their Kodacolor equivalent. Burgh is a postcard-pretty village around a green, its lanes lined with 17th- and 18th-century houses and a few of what are locally known as clay dabbins – cruck barns built from timber, clay, pebbles and hay. Walking north you pass a rush-thatched cottage with whitewashed walls and heavy buttresses that calls to mind the Vikings. It was warriors of another sort that made their mark here, though. Beside the Greyhound Inn stands a bronze statue of Edward I brandishing a sword and generally looking ready to take on all comers in the pub car park. The Hammer of the Scots died in Burgh in 1307. Sick with dysentery, the aged but still belligerent monarch was carried out to the edge of the Solway so he could call out the enemy with his dying breath. A Victorian stone tower marks the spot where Edward Longshanks croaked out his final insult. It’s surrounded by iron railings to protect it from the chunky, shaggy-coated cattle that wander the salty land as if re-enacting the scenes JMW Turner captured in his etching, Solway Moss. Nearby are remnants of more recent conflicts – concrete observation posts and a target arrow (which, as if in homage to Edward Longshanks, points straight towards Scotland) – left over from the cold war, when this strip of the Solway was an RAF firing range. Hadrian’s Wall begins to the west at Bowness-on-Solway, but there’s barely anything left of the stretch to Carlisle. Huge piles of the Roman masons’ precisely cut and crafted stone were carried off in the 15th and 16th centuries to build barns, houses and pele towers, thick-walled refuges for when reiver bands crossed the Solway on horseback via hazardous tidal fords or waths, to steal livestock and whatever chattels their victims possessed. There’s a good example of a pele at the eastern end of Saint Michael’s church. The violence of the Anglo-Scottish border was given a romantic gloss by Sir Walter Scott. The great novelist loved the wildness of the Solway, and as you walk towards the mouth of the River Eden, you’ll see Old Sandfield, which features in Redgauntlet, his novel of Jacobite revolt, as the Lady Lowther Inn. In the neat village of Beaumont, the Norman church is built on the site of a Roman turret. It’s barely 30 metres above sea level, but so low is the ground around it, the churchyard has commanding views that stretch from the north Pennines to the rugged brown hills of Annandale. Nearby is the course of a canal that once linked Carlisle with the hamlet of Fishers Cross, a dozen miles to the west (some of the bridges in Burgh were once aqueducts). In 1819, Fishers Cross was renamed Port Carlisle and investors promised that the new port would become “a second Liverpool”, bringing boom times to north Cumbria. The canal – deep and wide enough for 60-ton barges – had barely been completed when the railways arrived. Port Carlisle’s backers swiftly filled in the waterway and laid a track on top of it. They were too late. A rival group had already finished the line from Carlisle to the dock at Silloth. Port Carlisle was abandoned. Now all that remains of this once-grand scheme is a terrace of houses, a chapel and a few crumbling remnants of the old wharfs, a monument to the effects of what we might now call disruptive technology. The gleaming saltmarsh north and west of Beaumont is grooved with streams of dark water and the brackish muddy flats are filled with wading birds – godwits, redshanks, oystercatchers, turnstones and snowy white egrets – as well as half a dozen varieties of duck. The density of such succulent prey inevitably attracts raptors: peregrine falcons and hen harriers are spotted regularly and, if your eyes are keen enough, you may even catch a glimpse of the tiny, grey merlin whirling across the wide skies. In spring and autumn tens of thousands of barnacle and pink-footed geese and whooper swans land here on their way to and from their summer breeding grounds, the Solway’s enveloping quiet shattered by their mournful honking. The walk south from Beaumont takes you to Monkhill, where a converted and bladeless 19th-century windmill looms protectively above the tiny hamlet like some cartoon creature from the imagination of Tove Jansson. Drovers Rest is a traditional, low-slung pub with blazing fires and a warm, community feel. It has great beer, knowledgeable, enthusiastic staff and inventive, ale-friendly food. Co-owner and chef Tom McMaster is a former butcher who makes his own hot-smoked Cumberland sausages (vegan version available) to serve in homemade buns. The chips are chunky and crisp. Snacks include excellent pickled Czech cheese, and deep-fried macaroni cheese balls. There are about seven craft beers from northern breweries such as Ulverston, First and Last and Crazy Monkey, plus experimental brews from further afield. It’s the sort of place that makes you consider moving house to be near. Hillside Farm B&B is on a working 1850s farm in the hamlet of Boustead Hill, four miles west of Monkhill. The location couldn’t be better. The farm is almost slap on Hadrian’s Wall, with open views across the Solway marshes to Scotland. There’s a double and a twin in the main house and a Georgian stable block has been converted into a bunkhouse with room for a dozen people. It doesn’t take card payments, so bring cash or a chequebook.Doubles £90 B&B (single occupancy £60), bunk beds £15pp (fried breakfast from £4), hadrianswalkbnb.co.uk",Lifestyle/Travel,"A great walk to a great pub: the Drover’s Rest, Cumbria",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/14/a-great-walk-to-a-great-pub-the-drovers-rest-cumbria
1/14/2022," It is the first episode of this tense rural money-laundering thriller’s final season, and the opening scene epitomises the series: calm, almost banal domesticity giving way to explosive action. It is often said that extricating yourself safely from organised criminal activity is far harder than getting involved in the first place – and so it proves, when Marty and Wendy Byrde (Jason Bateman and Laura Linney) have a gently terrifying conversation with Felix Solis’s cartel boss Navarro. Elsewhere, Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) is making a move – and might a vacuum be developing for her family to fill? The knowledge that the end is near only adds to the excitement.Netflix, from Friday 21 January A cheerfully robust series on living with autism from Friday Night Lights creator Jason Katims. Three housemates, all on the spectrum, look to find their places in the world but face obstacles beyond the usual travails of twentysomething life. This requires a light and careful comedic touch, but it’s worth bearing in mind that Katims has a son with Asperger’s. Don’t expect much sentimentality – when Rick Glassman’s Jack is told by his helper: “I think you are such a beautiful person,” his response (“That makes me want to throw up”) suggests someone neither wanting nor expecting special treatment.Amazon Prime Video, from Friday 21 January A lovely curio developed, as such things increasingly are, from a YouTube show. Enigmatic comic and rapper Ogmios drives through the streets of north London, calmly, sardonically but always kindly remarking upon what he sees and recording it on a dash cam. If you didn’t think that driving in the Smoke could be meditative, you’re in for a surprise – Ogmios is unfailingly polite and even philosophical: giving way to other motorists, slowing down for pigeons in the road, and worrying about cyclists. A cult gem in the making.BBC Three, from Sunday 16 January Remarkably – and horrifyingly – according to this new two-part documentary, one in five women will be stalked in their lifetime. Stacey Dooley embeds herself with a specialist police unit in Cheshire and a victim support organisation in Hampshire as she explores the reality of something that clearly isn’t limited to people in the public eye. Along the way, she discovers how easily stalking can escalate into harassment and, eventually, serious violence, and spends time with both victims and perpetrators as she seeks to understand stalking’s roots.BBC Three, from Wednesday 19 January Hot on the heels of BBC One’s The Tourist and Channel 4’s Close to Me, another drama about amnesia. In this French thriller, it has afflicted policeman Adam Belmont (Guillaume Labbé) who, in the middle of an investigation into a child killer, takes a bullet to the head. Not ideal in terms of the case but, additionally, Belmont has forgotten his own son and the colleague with whom he was having an affair. Worse still, there’s a terrified woman tied up in his basement and he has no idea how she got there. Melodramatic and occasionally baffling stuff.All 4, from Friday 21 January An extraordinary, bewildering true-crime documentary series about con artist Robert Hendy-Freegard, a former car salesman from Derbyshire who masqueraded as an undercover MI5 agent and insinuated himself into the lives of numerous women. They were then defrauded, manipulated and, at times, physically threatened into abandoning their previous lives. It does a good job of communicating the horrendous damage Hendy-Freegard has left in his wake as the families of some of his victims bravely step forward to tell their stories.Netflix, from Tuesday 18 January Apple TV+ has been the subject of an ongoing stealth Fraggle takeover for a while now. In 2020, the platform screened a series of shorts called Fraggle Rock: Rock On! and it has subsequently acquired old seasons of the Jim Henson puppet extravaganza. But now, the frizzy-haired, boggle-eyed scamps are back in earnest, sticking largely to the joyfully chaotic, all-singing, all-dancing vibe of the original show. But will 20s kids find the show as entrancing as their 80s counterparts once did? Nostalgic parents will be keen to find out with this 13-episode run.Apple TV+, from Friday 21 January",Arts/Television & radio,From Ozark to Puppet Master: the seven best shows to stream this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/14/from-ozark-to-puppet-master-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week
1/14/2022,"The Bureau of Meteorology is working to verify readings showing the northern Western Australia town of Onslow has matched the record for the hottest day in Australia, prompting calls to make living with extreme heatwaves in the Pilbara more sustainable. According to the bureau’s records, Oodnadatta in South Australia’s outback experienced the hottest day ever in 2 January 1960 with a reading of 50.7C. On Thursday, the coastal town of Onslow, 1,386km north of Perth and home to 848 residents, matched that.   Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nearby towns of Roebourne and Mardie also sweltered through the heatwave, with automatic weather stations recording temperatures of 50.5C – matching the hottest day ever recorded in Western Australia and breaking a new record for the second hottest day recorded nationally. Last year’s hottest place was Mardie, with a reading of 47.9C, meaning the temperature in Onslow was hotter than anywhere else in the country during 2021. Temperatures of 40C were felt from Fitzroy Crossing in the southern Kimberley and down to Norseman in the southern Goldfields. Temperatures were not expected to get as high on Friday, but Onslow recorded a temperature of 48C just after midday. Despite experiencing 50C on Thursday, Roebourne locals were unfazed by the extreme weather. Michael Woodley, the CEO of the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation and a resident of the 630-person town, said it was “just another day in the Pilbara”. Woodley said people were pragmatic about the near-record-breaking day and looked to beat the heat however they could. Those who had air conditioning spent the day inside, while those without were forced to venture out to find some shade and keep cool with a garden sprinkler – or at the local pool. “People don’t really think about it. People here just know one day is hotter than the next, but I think it’s something people should be a bit more aware of now with climate change,” Woodley said. “If 50C becomes the norm, there’ll be serious problems, obviously.” He said that given the records, he hoped authorities would now consider what was needed to make living in the Pilbara sustainable, particularly as it was home to many First Nations people. Last year was the world’s fifth-hottest year on record, according to preliminary readings, and was likely the hottest recorded year with a La Niña event in the Pacific. La Niña years are characterised by the Pacific Ocean absorbing more heat than in a neutral year. The Macquarie University deputy vice-chancellor and member of the Climate Council, Prof Lesley Hughes, said temperature spikes during heatwaves showed the danger of climate change because “life isn’t lived on an average”. “Averages are useful because we can compare averages between years or averages between decades, but what averages hide is a whole world of pain,” Hughes said. “Along with those averages are the extremes, and it’s with the extremes we actually get the impact. Averages don’t usually kill. It’s the extremes that do the harm.” Heatwaves can be deadly when people are caught outside in high temperatures and quickly become dehydrated, leading to a surge in hospitalisations and even deaths. Extreme heat can cause heatstroke and exhaustion, but also strokes and heart attacks in more serious cases. Hughes said extreme heat puts stress on multiple functions of the body and can become lethal when core temperatures are pushed “outside a narrow band of safety”. This risk grows higher as heatwaves drag out over multiple days and overnight temperatures remain high, making it difficult for people to cool down. The high temperatures raised concerns about vulnerable people across the region, including 169 prisoners held at Roebourne prison on Thursday whose cells were not equipped with air conditioning. A spokesperson for the WA Department of Justice said cell temperatures were monitored throughout the day and prisoners were provided with fans and ice, but cells with air conditioning were limited and had to be reserved for those with medical conditions. “The department employs a number of effective controls to manage the heat risk across the state,” the spokesperson said. “At Roebourne, this includes fans in every cell, air conditioning in the recreation hall, shade structures in the main areas of the prison and a flexible routine to adjust to the Pilbara’s heat conditions.” The spokesperson said medical staff were continuing to monitor prisoners’ health and safety on Friday but did not respond to questions about whether air conditioning would become the norm due to hotter temperatures.",News/Australia news,Concerns for life in Western Australia’s Pilbara after 50.7C heat record matched ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/14/concerns-for-life-in-western-australias-pilbara-after-507c-heat-record-matched
