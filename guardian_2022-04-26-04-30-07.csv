4/26/2022,"MPs and peers are set for some late nights over the next few days as government and opposition race to complete six bills in time for parliament to be prorogued by the end of this week. Though the House of Commons leader, Mark Spencer, said business would conclude by Thursday – which would give MPs next week to get some shoe leather on the pavements ahead of the local elections – the Lords may have other ideas. It means whips may decide to have the Commons sit next Tuesday and Wednesday, potentially throwing some MPs’ election schedules into disarray. The unpalatability of that prospect may force the government to compromise on amendments to legislation made by the House of Lords – who have signalled they are prepared to continue to send bills back to the Commons even at the 11th hour. The parliamentary battles in the week ahead read like a rogues gallery of all the most difficult and controversial proposals that Boris Johnson has announced – from noisy protests, to offshoring asylum seekers, to costs for renters in unsafe buildings and changes to election law. On Monday, peers amended the elections bill to strengthen the independence of the electoral commission, having previously also voted to prevent the use of voter ID. The elections bill and the nationality and borders bill are among those where compromise appears the most likely in the coming days – which could have some significant ramifications. Peers made 12 amendments to the bill, which returns to the Lords on Tuesday without compromise. At least six are expected to be returned to the Commons again on totemic issues such as the right of asylum seekers to work after six months, proposed by the Tory peer Philippa Stroud. The Lords also voted to amend the controversial offshoring proposals in the bill, which would allow asylum seekers to be sent overseas to a third country for their claims to be processed. The government announced its policy of sending claimants to Rwanda for asylum since the last debate. Another policy that peers are expected to double-down on is an amendment from Labour Vernon Coaker to water down a provision in the bill on arriving in the UK without permission. It would clarify that the new offence applies only to those doing so in breach of a deportation order. There are other bills where Lords sources believe the government could make concessions in order to get them through in time. On the judicial review and courts bill, peers are hopefully of a win – or at the very least a commitment to review – on an amendment on legal aid for the bereaved. Peers are also likely to return their amendment to the policing bill, to change the proposed new law that would outlaw noisy protests. On all these issues, it is possible the government will not give any further ground. Or the compromises offered could be acceptable but weak – a promise of a review of the policy in a certain time period, for example. Crossbenchers, on which many of the votes will ultimately depend, often lose appetite for inflicting defeats on the elected house. But most peers who seek to change the legislation seem resolute – especially on the borders bill. It will be interesting to see if the bill about which Johnson and Priti Patel have been their noisiest will end up having some kind of quiet compromise on its most eye-watering proposals.",News/UK news,Election schedules could favour compromise on government’s most controversial bills,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/election-schedules-could-favour-compromise-on-governments-most-controversial-bills
4/26/2022,"Shortly before the Tokyo Olympics, one of the top British gymnastics coaches was removed from the Great Britain Olympic coaching team following allegations about her treatment of a former gymnast, according to a report published by BBC Sport. The veteran coach Liz Kincaid coached a number of gymnasts including Amelie Morgan, part of the historic Olympic bronze medal-winning team in Tokyo, but an allegation was made against her relating to the mental health of one her former gymnasts, which prompted an investigation. Under the British Olympic Association rules, the ongoing investigation left her ineligible for the British team in Tokyo. In July 2021 it was announced that Kincaid would be retiring from the sport. Two gymnasts have since stepped forward with further allegations against Kincaid, which range from claims that she implored them to compete while seriously injured to her shaming gymnasts about their weight. Poppy Wynn, a 25-year-old former gymnast, said she tore her perineum at 12 years old after falling off the uneven bars during an unmonitored set and landing in oversplits. Kincaid allegedly told Wynn’s mother that she had merely started her period, but doctors immediately identified a far more serious injury. “I went to Liz, I had blood dripping down my leg and she then took me into the office and gave me sanitary pads to effectively mop up the blood and then sent me back into the gym,” Wynn said to the BBC. Wynn claimed that under Kincaid she trained on a broken hand for six weeks, while the former British champion Sophie Jameson said she was made to train on a broken ankle and she was once required to continue “excruciating” upper body training under Kincaid while recovering from a dislocated knee. Both gymnasts said Kincaid spoke to them demeaningly, shouting in the faces of gymnasts and weight-shaming them. Kincaid has denied all of the allegations made against her, issuing a statement to the BBC. It read: “The health, well-being and safety of the gymnasts under my care and tuition was of paramount importance to me and a matter close to my heart. To suggest I would mistreat the gymnasts goes against every principle I live by and is very upsetting.” The allegations are the latest in a long list of similar claims as gymnastics reckons with reports of abusive coaching methods widespread around the world. In 2020, numerous British gymnasts, including Becky and Ellie Downie, Nile Wilson and Amy Tinkler, came forward with allegations of mistreatment and abuse against numerous British gymnastics coaches and officials. British gymnastics is under an independent investigation led by Anne Whyte QC and initiated by UK Sport and Sport England. Its findings are due to be published next month.",Sport/Sport,Gymnastics coach was pulled from GB squad over mistreatment allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/25/gymnastics-coach-pulled-from-team-gb-squad-after-allegations-of-mistreatment
4/26/2022,"Elon Musk, the owner of one of Twitter’s most followed accounts, is now its owner. On the evidence of his tweets over the past month, expect change at the social media platform. Here are some of the biggest issues you can expect him to address. Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist”, and the fate of the former US president’s suspended Twitter account represents a strong test of that ideal. Trump was banned permanently shortly after the Capitol riot in January 2021, as the company cited his repeated violations of the company’s rules and the risk of “further incitement of violence”. Musk said this month that he was “very cautious with permanent bans” on Twitter and would prefer a timeout system. But he has not directly addressed the issue of Trump’s account, which had almost 89 million followers. Speaking at a TED conference, Musk said: “I think it’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech. Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have the … reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.” However, Trump was banned in part because Twitter feared his tweets were inciting law-breaking. Musk has to reconcile his free speech principles with legal reality – and Trump’s history on the platform. Nonetheless, one group of House Republicans has urged Musk to act. Hey, @elonmusk it's a great week to free @realDonaldTrump. The social media industry is coming under more stringent regulation, particularly in Europe. Last week the EU announced the Digital Services Act, under which companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google will have to do more to tackle illegal content or face multibillion-euro fines. It will be preceded by the UK’s online safety bill, which requires social media platforms to protect their users from harmful content and comes into force at about the end of the year. In the US there are moves for regulatory change, although they must overcome perennial political gridlock. Legislative proposals in Washington include creating a new digital safety bureau at the Federal Trade Commission and the creation of new children’s safety requirements for tech companies. The latter is co-sponsored by the Democrat senator Richard Blumenthal, who led an explosive evidence session with the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen last year and has been vocal in his support for the greater regulation of social media. Twitter investors have long been concerned with the company’s growth in revenue and users. In its most recent quarterly results, revenue grew more slowly than expected, despite rising 22% to $1.6bn in the last three months of 2021. However, daily active users rose by 25 million over the year to 217 million as the company reiterated its goal of hitting 315 million such users by the end of next year. In a since-deleted tweet this month, Musk raised the possibility of removing advertising from the platform’s premium service, Blue, which is available in the US and Australia but not the UK. Twitter makes 90% of its annual revenue of $5bn (£3.8bn) from advertising, so Musk was broaching a potentially radical move. Musk is not the first Twitter shareholder to express concerns about how the company is run. Elliott Management, an activist investment firm, took a stake in Twitter in 2020, amid reports that it thought the platform had a distracted chief executive in Jack Dorsey and was not adding innovative new products quickly enough. Dorsey survived the initial pressure but left in November last year and his replacement, Parag Agrawal, was promoted to the top post from the position of chief technology officer. In a message to the Twitter chairman, Bret Taylor, Musk made clear that another executive shake-up is in the offing if he succeeds in buying the company. “If the deal doesn’t work, given that I don’t have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.” Musk is CEO of Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, as well as being the owner of the tunnelling business the Boring Company, so there are enough demands on his time already. Tesla shareholders will want Musk to stay focused on running a $1tn electric carmaker but it would be a surprise if Musk is a hands-off owner of Twitter. There will be changes at Twitter under Musk’s ownership and an edit button is one of the options under consideration. In a flurry of tweets posted in the wake of his emergence as a 9.2% shareholder in Twitter earlier this month, Musk flagged the possibility of introducing the feature. The ability to undo a tweet posted in haste is available to Blue subscribers only, who have a 60-second grace period after posting their tweet in which they can remove it before it is seen by anyone. Do you want an edit button? Twitter subsequently confirmed that it had been looking at the edit button idea. Other changes suggested by Musk include making Twitter’s algorithm open source, meaning users would be able to view the algorithm that curates what users see. Musk has also said that Twitter users should be able to see if their post has been promoted or demoted.",News/Technology,Five things in Elon Musk’s in-tray after Twitter takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/25/five-things-in-elon-musks-in-tray-after-twitter-takeover
4/26/2022,"It’s normal practice for a prime minister to report back to the House at the first available opportunity on returning from an overseas trip. So you’d have thought Boris Johnson would have been keen to make a statement to the Commons about last week’s Indian adventure. Both to tell stories of how he bravely forgot to mention India’s neutrality towards Russia in its war on Ukraine during his meeting with the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and of a country in which he isn’t universally disliked and mistrusted. But The Convict thought better of it. He used to regard the Commons as his natural habitat. An environment in which he was guaranteed to get the love and laughter that he craves. Now it’s a symbol of his disgrace. An unwelcome reminder of his dishonesty. A sore that can never begin to heal until either he does the decent thing and resigns or his fragile ego crumbles under the weight of his lies. The only MPs to even pretend to believe a word he says these days are the spineless ministerial apparatchiks, now engaged in a constant internal struggle between abject denial and cognitive dissonance – think the junior culture minister Chris Philp, who has yet to find an arse he didn’t want to brown-nose and who had sworn blind on national television on Monday morning that it was entirely plausible that Johnson and Nadine Dorries could have independently sent identical tweets: how little self-worth must you have to do that? – and fawning halfwitted sycophants, such as Micky Fabricant. The rest either confront The Convict head on, either openly laughing or spitting with rage at his deceit, or maintain a silence laced with contempt. So instead of staying in Westminster, thanking his lucky stars that he hadn’t yet received a second fixed-penalty notice for the party in which the empties and the stragglers had been picked out of the flowerbeds, Johnson had headed north to Bury. Quite what he was doing there was anyone’s guess. According to Number 10, he was campaigning for the local elections. But as most councillors now concede that he is a liability, the only thing he can have been campaigning for is to increase the number of Tory losses next week. After kicking a football aimlessly at Bury FC, Johnson did a pool clip for the lunchtime news. Inevitably, most questions focused on his reaction to the previous day’s Mail on Sunday article in which a Tory MP had claimed Angela Rayner tried to distract Johnson at prime minister’s questions by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The Convict said he was furious. Not only had a woman never managed to put him off his stride in the past – he had maintained his laser-like focus even when Jennifer Arcuri had been pole-dancing in front of him – but such misogyny had no place in his Tory party. “If we ever find who is responsible for it,” he said, “I don’t know what we will do, but they will be the terrors of the Earth.” This sounded very much like a quote from King Lear. A subject on which Johnson may yet become an expert if he ever gets round to employing a researcher to write most of the Shakespeare biography for which he has trousered a reported £800k advance. Though he might now be wishing he had chosen his Lear more carefully. The extract he referenced is from when Lear is in the process of going mad and losing his kingdom. Who knows, within a few days he might take to walking naked on the heath. Then the emperor really will have no clothes. It also wasn’t entirely clear just how seriously Johnson was taking the Rayner claims. He did at least manage not to smirk as he condemned those who had briefed the story but The Convict himself has form for sexism and misogyny. Just think of his descriptions of women beach volleyball players at the 2012 Olympics as “glistening like wet otters” and women in burkas as “letterboxes”. Or that women who voted Tory would have bigger breasts. Even when he’s seemingly not to blame, he’s still a liability. His weight of baggage is just too heavy. One person who was taking this seriously was the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, who began proceedings in the Commons by saying he had arranged a meeting with the editor of the Mail on Sunday to discuss the matter. We then moved on to Home Office departmental questions. A rather bloodless affair, which had the feel of everyone going through the motions in the run-up to another week’s recess before the state opening of parliament. Still, even an only semi-engaged Priti Patel is plenty vicious and stupid enough to provide some entertainment. She sat proudly beside Tom Pursglove, a junior Home Office minister who might possibly be dimmer than she is – even between them both they can’t supply a connecting synapse – only to stand up to once more declare Rwanda to be an African paradise. If there was a problem with her asylum seeker policy it was that the Channel would be overcrowded with refugees coming over in search of a free air ticket. And anyone who questioned Rwanda’s human rights record was just racist. It was when she got to the costs that she became seriously deranged. It wasn’t up to her to tell the Commons how much the scheme would cost, she insisted. It was up to the opposition parties to come up with different proposals. Though if she had listened, she would have realised they had. But by now, Priti Vacant was off on one. Labour shouldn’t care about what the scheme costs as they had said it was unworkable. So it wouldn’t cost the taxpayer anything anyway. She paused to give her own benches a knowing look. She genuinely thought it was a “Gotcha” moment.

4/26/2022,"The US defense secretary’s declaration that Washington wanted to see Russia weakened militarily and unable to recover quickly, marks a shift in Washington’s declared aims underlying its military support for Ukraine. At a press conference in Poland after a surprise visit to Kyiv, Lloyd Austin was asked if he would now define US goals differently from those set out after the Russian invasion. In response, he started out with the established administration line about helping Ukraine retain its sovereignty and defend its territory. Then Austin added a second goal: “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.” That meant Russia should “not have the capability to very quickly reproduce” the forces and equipment that had been lost in Ukraine. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, estimated those losses on Monday as a quarter of Russia’s pre-invasion strength, with more than 2,000 armoured vehicles knocked out, including at least 530 tanks, as well as 60 aircraft. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who travelled with Austin to see Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, agreed with his formulation of US objectives, saying: “I think the secretary said it very well”. The two officials were talking as the first howitzers from the latest tranche of US military supplies began arriving in Ukraine, and $165m in supplies of “non-standard” ex-Soviet compatible ammunition was announced. The remarks suggested that even if Russian forces withdrew or were expelled from the Ukrainian territory they have occupied since 24 February, the US and its allies would seek to maintain sanctions with the aim of stopping Russia reconstituting its forces. It also indicated Washington is taking a position in an internal debate within Nato on whether or not to use the opportunity of Vladimir Putin’s strategic blunder in Ukraine to try to hobble his ability to threaten other countries in the future. “The balance in Nato itself has shifted,” Rajan Menon, the director of the grand strategy programme at the Defense Priorities thinktank, said. “The argument now seems to be this is not just about Ukraine; it’s about a larger problem, that is the threat that Russia poses to Europe as a whole. And if you look at it that way, then these comments begin to make sense.” “The Russians are on the retreat, so you have this flush of optimism which has moved the goalposts,” Menon, professor emeritus in international relations at Columbia University, said. “Once Washington says it, those in Nato who want the war to be about that are empowered, because what the US says matters.” If those are the Biden administration’s aims, there is a separate question of whether it was sensible to declare them so bluntly. It arguably weakens Russia’s incentive to withdraw, reinforces Moscow’s narrative that Nato is waging a proxy war in Ukraine aimed at weakening Russia and even regime change, deepening Putin’s paranoia. “If I was writing the secretary’s talking points, I would prefer he said: our goal is that Ukraine wins, rather than our goal is to weaken Russia because they are two sides of the same coin, but one would have been much more aligned with what the administration has been saying,” said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, said “Certainly this will be used by the Russian state media to double down on the narrative that we’ve already seen from the Russian government, that the US is “out to get us”, that they want to destroy Russia,” she said, but added: “Frankly, I don’t think we should worry too much about how this will be spun by the Russian media, because they can spin anything.” Ultimately, Polyakova said, Austin was voicing a widespread feeling about the long-term threat posed by Putin that is increasingly difficult to ignore. “I think the secretary’s comments were truthful in that it will be in the greater interest of global stability and European security not to have a military aggressive state, bordering Nato or bordering Europe,” she said. “I think that’s very obvious.”",News/World news,Pentagon chief’s Russia remarks show shift in US’s declared aims in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/russia-weakedend-lloyd-austin-ukraine
4/26/2022,"Twitter has agreed to sell itself to Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, in a $44bn (£35bn) deal. The deal puts the Tesla chief executive in charge of a company with 217 million users and an influential role in shaping the political and media agenda on both sides of the Atlantic. Twitter’s initial reluctance to accept a transaction appeared to fade after Musk confirmed a funding package for the deal and shareholders warmed to it. Musk has signalled that Twitter will be overhauled under his leadership, including changes in content moderation, having described himself as a “free speech absolutist”. The deal comes after a dramatic few weeks of speculation about Twitter’s future, triggered by Musk’s emergence as the platform’s largest single shareholder on 4 April. He then declared a $43bn takeover bid on 14 April, which prompted Twitter’s board to signal its displeasure at his overtures by adopting a so-called poison pill defence 24 hours later. However, the apparent opposition of Twitter’s board faded after Musk drew up a $46.5bn funding package for the bid, including $21bn of his own money. According to reports, both shareholders and the Twitter board began to take the offer seriously once finance had been put in place. The deal is not expected to face serious scrutiny from US competition authorities because Musk’s major business interests – an electric car company, the SpaceX rocket business and tunnelling firm the Boring Company – do not compete with Twitter. However, the deal is likely to draw comment from politicians and campaigning bodies given Twitter’s influence as an information source and Musk’s stance on free speech.

4/26/2022,"The Texas court of criminal appeals has issued a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio, the Mexican-American woman who was set to be judicially killed within 48 hours, ordering a lower court to consider new evidence of her innocence in the death of her two-year-old daughter Mariah. The court issued its order on Monday as the final clock was ticking on Lucio’s transfer to the death chamber. She would have been the first Hispanic woman executed by Texas. As Wednesday’s scheduled execution date grew closer, calls for a stay to give time for new scientific evidence of her innocence to be reviewed grew to fever pitch. The intensity of the outcry against her pending death rivaled that of the case of Troy Davis, the African American man executed by Georgia in 2011 despite serious doubts around his guilt. New evidence presented by Lucio’s legal team in a 266-page petition suggested that the murder of her toddler daughter had never even happened. Medical and eye-witness evidence pointed towards Mariah having died after accidentally falling down a steep flight of stairs at Lucio’s rental home. In a statement, Lucio thanked the court of criminal appeals for giving her the chance “to live and prove my innocence. Mariah is in my heart today and always.” Sandra Babcock, one of Lucio’s legal team and a professor at Cornell law school, said that the court’s decision paved the way for a new trial which would allow a jury to hear evidence that was not presented at her original trial in 2008. Five of the 12 jury members from that trial have said that had they known what is now known about the case they would have decided differently. Babcock said: “Melissa’s life matters. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence, and now locked away for these past 15 years, Melissa’s voice and experiences have never been valued. The Court’s decision signals its willingness to finally hear Melissa’s side of the story.” Vanessa Potkin of the Innocence Project, who also represents Lucio, said: “Medical evidence shows that Mariah’s death was consistent with an accident. But for the State’s use of false testimony, no juror would have voted to convict Melissa of capital murder because no murder occurred.” Jeff Leach, the Republican lawmaker who led the push in the Texas House for a delay of execution, greeted the news of the stay with delight, saying it would secure “justice for Melissa and for Mariah and the entire Lucio family”. Earlier, Leach told the Guardian in an interview that the failings of the prosecution in Lucio’s case had shaken his belief in the death penalty. He said her treatment had “given me great pause and made me reconsider my stance on whether this is the way we want to do things in the state of Texas”. Leach has been at the forefront of efforts by Texas lawmakers to persuade the authorities to postpone the execution. He orchestrated a letter to the board of pardons signed by 80 House members, 32 of whom are Republican. A similar letter has been sent by 20 Texas senators, eight Republican. In the House letter, the lawmakers pointed out that Lucio was treated by prosecutors in a completely different way to her husband, who was also responsible for Mariah’s care. Lucio had no previous history of violence and her children said she had never been abusive towards them; by contrast her husband had a history of assault yet is now a free man having only served a four-year sentence for child endangerment. The extent of bipartisan agreement, with more than half the legislature backing calls for a stay, is extremely rare in such a riven state.",News/US news,Texas death row prisoner Melissa Lucio granted stay of execution,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/melissa-lucio-stay-of-execution-texas
4/26/2022,"Sajid Javid is being urged to change the law to let pharmacists alter prescriptions during medicine shortages, as it emerged that some women are travelling hundreds of miles to seek hormone replacement therapy products. There have been acute shortages of some HRT products, which are used by about 1 million women in the UK to treat symptoms of the menopause. Claire Anderson, the president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said community pharmacists should be able to dispense substitute versions of medicines on prescription without having to contact the prescriber – typically a GP – every time. Currently, the law in England stipulates they must provide only the exact prescription. The proposed shake-up would also let pharmacists make changes to quantities, strength and formulation of HRT and other medicines dispensed. “At the moment pharmacists cannot amend prescriptions for HRT, so have to refer women back to their GPs when a medicine is not available,” Anderson said. “Enabling pharmacists to do so will save time for patients, pharmacists and doctors, as well as lessening the anxiety for women waiting for medicines.” On Sunday Javid announced plans to appoint a HRT tsar to get to grips with the shortages. The number of HRT products prescribed in England has more doubled in the last five years, contributing to stocks running low, while manufacturers have reported supply problems. Some women are sharing their prescriptions or travelling hundreds of miles to source products, and there are fears that some women may be becoming suicidal as a result of their symptoms going untreated. Anderson said she welcomed Javid’s plan to recruit a HRT tsar, but she added: “With continued concerns from patient groups about medicines supply for people with other conditions, this appointment must be part of a wider government strategy to ensure patient access to medicines.” She said: “Pharmacists spend many hours dealing with medicines shortages when we’d rather be talking to patients about their care. One solution would be to enable pharmacists to make minor changes to a prescription when something is out of stock. This is faster for patients and more efficient for the NHS. “Difficulties in accessing HRT unfairly impacts women, affects their mental health and worsens health inequalities – this is an area that not only impacts our patients but also the health and care workforce.” The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC), which represents NHS community pharmacies in England, said demand was outstripping supply for a small number of HRT medicines, and longer, 12-month prescriptions were exacerbating the situation. “Disruptions to medicines supply can fluctuate very rapidly and on a very localised basis,” a PSNC spokesperson said. “The situation is very variable depending on demand, local prescribing and existing stock levels in pharmacies, and it is difficult to gain a snapshot of where supply is sitting as it is constantly moving through the supply chain. “We know that some pharmacies are receiving HRT prescriptions from women and prescribers hundreds of miles away, but we don’t have anything to confirm whether there is any significant regional variation in supplies.” Janet Morrison, the chief executive of the PSNC, said: “The current disruption to supplies of some HRT medicines appears to only be affecting a small number of medicines, and most pharmacies report that they are able to help women in need of medication quickly. “The disruption appears to be being driven by sudden increases in demand for some medicines, and by some prescriptions being written for much longer periods than is usual. It is incredibly worrying for women if they are not able to access medicines that they rely on. Pharmacies teams know this, and they will do all that they can to help. In many cases, other formulations may be available, although this can take a little time for pharmacies to sort out as they will need to speak to your GP first.” The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, a co-chair of the UK menopause taskforce, welcomed ministers’ promises to address the shortages. She said: “The trouble with the menopause is for far too long women have not been listened to, women have been ignored, they’ve been prescribed and diagnosed with other conditions and the menopause wasn’t even considered.”",News/Society,Calls to relax pharmacy rules amid HRT shortages in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/calls-to-relax-pharmacy-rules-amid-hrt-shortages-in-england
4/26/2022,"Battered and bruised, France’s “republican front” did its job once more in Sunday’s presidential election runoff. Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest. For France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least. As the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight. Reflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June. If he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off. To make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon. As he contemplates five more years in office, Mr Macron must realise that he has been given not so much a mandate as another chance.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Macron’s victory: a fragile mandate | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-macrons-victory-a-fragile-mandate

You f***ing have consequences for your actions!” But in other exchanges in the Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom on Monday, Depp wrote to his former wife’s mother describing himself as a “poor old junkie” who depended on his wife and her family. “What you do need to know [is] that your daughter has risen far above the nightmarish task of taking care of this poor old junkie. Never a second has gone by that she didn’t look out for me, to have her eyes on me to make sure that I was OK,” he wrote, the court heard. “She has the strength of a thousand men,” Depp added in the note. The exchange came close to the end of Heard’s attorneys’ opportunity, with Depp on the witness stand, to paint the actor as a violent domestic abuser whose behavior was integral to dependencies on drugs and alcohol. The actor has described the accusations of substance abuse as “grossly embellished” and argued it was Heard who escalated their fights to violence. Under questioning from his own lawyers, Depp was asked how he felt about the article Heard wrote for the Washington Post describing herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse” two years after she’d been granted a restraining order against him for throwing a cell phone. “At that point it had been a good two solid years since the allegations had been planted firmly on my back,” Depp testified. “I couldn’t believe it … it was clear that, the more hit pieces came out on me, it was clear that Ms Heard’s righteous chase against me was continuing.” “Something had to be done,” he said, referring to bringing the defamation complaint in Virginia. “I couldn’t take it anymore.” Depp said he felt he had no opportunity to address the allegations against him, and by then Disney had dropped him from the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. “It hurt, like somebody hit me in the head with a two-by-four. Even if I tried to do an interview to explain myself, it turned into a hit piece.” But Heard’s attorney, Ben Rottenborn, showed Depp negative news articles he said would show that the actor’s bad press preceded the 2018 Washington Post article at the center of the case. “I’ve been in the racket of Hollywood since 1984 … of course people write negative stories,” Depp countered. Depp also explained that his texts to Paul Bettany in which he’d suggested drowning and burning his wife were references to a Monty Python sketch. The actor told the jury that when he used the term “monster” it was his term to describe himself when he’d relapsed out of addiction recovery, or failed to attain sobriety. In his arguments with Heard, he said that when the tenor of the exchanges was reduced to scream obscenities, “the monster was just, for me, was a guy who’s dumb enough to take part in arguments that would ultimately went nowhere.” For both plaintiff and defendant, much of the legal trail has been about establishing probability that their account makes the alleged defamation seem more feasible or unlikely. Much of what has been heard is not directly relevant to the alleged libel but offered as background that could ultimately decide the fate and the reputations of the parties.

4/26/2022,"Five months after special administrators were appointed at Bulb in an act of quasi-nationalisation, the government is discovering a few truths that should have been obvious on day one. There isn’t a long queue of would-be buyers willing to pay good money for a failed energy supplier with 1.7 million customers when wholesale markets are still in turmoil. Taxpayers’ financial exposure is only increasing with every passing month. And semi-state ownership brings some level of ministerial responsibility for how the business is run, including the inexplicable decision to continue paying Hayden Wood, cofounder and chief executive, his £250,000 salary as if nothing had happened. “We do not want this company to be in this temporary state longer than is absolutely necessary,” Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, told parliament last November when announcing the administration. The initial advance of £1.7bn of public money was intended to cover Bulb’s working capital requirements for six months, which seemed to be the soft deadline for getting rid of the problem. That deadline is unlikely to be met, though a summer exit is still possible. However, neither interested party named by the Sunday Times can be regarded as unproblematic. Passing Bulb to Centrica, the owner of British Gas, would entrench the market leader’s dominance and, even in an emergency that has demonstrated the benefit of having well-capitalised suppliers that don’t fall over, ministers are still supposed to have half an eye on long-term competition. The other reported runner is Masdar, out of Abu Dhabi, which offers no experience of the UK retail energy market. Other parties could still emerge, but the burning question is whether a “sale” of Bulb would merit the term. Centrica is said to want taxpayer support for an unknown period to cover the cost of buying energy for Bulb’s customers, a demand that seems entirely sensible on its part. Current wholesale prices equate to £1,000 above today’s price cap. If the difference means losses for Centrica, its shareholders surely wouldn’t tolerate a deal without a dowry. The government’s plan B, one assumes, is a break-up of Bulb, with the customers parcelled out around the current main players. That process would be fiddly, but Kwarteng would be wise not to dismiss it; it may be needed to clear a developing political headache. In the meantime, he should ask if the public purse is getting value from the administrator, Teneo. Handing bonuses to staff to prevent a wave of resignations is theoretically defensible, but where’s the evidence that Bulb was in danger of imploding? As for Wood’s generous retainer, there is no justification. Calls for a shareholder rebellion at Just Eat Takeaway (JET) are in order for the reasons outlined here last week. This is the delivery company that over-ordered in destructive fashion for its investors: it attempted to consume Grubhub of the US before it had digested the merger of Takeaway.com of the Netherlands and Just Eat of the UK. The shares have fallen 75% since the $7.3bn (£5.7bn) Grubhub deal was unveiled in June 2020. So, yes, Cat Rock Capital, with a 6.9% stake, is right to demand a clear-out of the supervisory board that has overseen the calamity. But, among the executives, it feels perverse to target the finance boss, Brent Wissink, while slapping an “abstain” recommendation on the chief executive, Jitse Groen. The argument seems to be the idea that Grubhub was a “capital allocation mistake”, but, if so, the mistake was primarily Groen’s. He is the founder of the business, the architect of the rapid acquisition strategy and the person who publicly defended the Grubhub deal. Groen’s stake is as large as Cat Rock’s, which makes him harder to oust; and separating him from his loyal number-counter may send a useful corrective message. Ultimately, though, JET is Groen’s creation and he’s the man who should be in the spotlight. Even before Elon Musk’s $44bn purchase of Twitter was confirmed on Monday evening, one could say that the board’s devious “poison pill” defence was a waste of time. A threat to flood the market with discounted shares advertised weakness because it suggested the directors couldn’t assemble a decent argument based on creating more value independently. Far from buying time, the move seems only to have encouraged Twitter’s major shareholders to lobby the board to get to the negotiating table. In the process, Musk has avoided scrutiny over how he would run Twitter, which is the core issue for anyone who cares about the quality of public discourse. The poison pill was a self-defeating distraction.",News/Business,The only easy decision for Bulb’s future: stop paying its CEO,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/25/the-only-easy-decision-for-bulbs-future-stop-paying-its-ceo
