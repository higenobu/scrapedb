3/7/2022,"“I’ve still got people on roofs needing food and rescuing, and I’ve just got to find someone to get to them,” says Ash Jones at the Rotorwing Helicopter hangar at the Lismore airport in northern New South Wales. Jones has been working long hours as a volunteer air traffic controller and donation coordinator, and is de facto leader at the hangar. She says she is too busy to be interviewed. A week after fatal floods hit Lismore and NSW’s northern rivers, the region is still in emergency mode, and with waters slow to recede and some areas still cut off, residents living in remote properties are now requiring urgent evacuations and supply drops. The volunteer operation sprang up out of the Rotorwing hangar last Monday, just as owner Michael Barnes’s home became flooded. “When everyone was confused about what to do at the beginning of last week, it was the locals that started doing food drops. We set up a makeshift job card system and they’d come in and take one or two and off they’d go,” Barnes said. Since then, a community-led emergency response unit – similar to volunteer operations in nearby Mullumbimby – has coordinated at least 200 rescue and airdrop missions delivering food, medicines and petrol to about 5000 people living in cut-off homes over a mammoth area of north-east NSW. More than 20 tonnes of essential goods have so far been delivered by a fleet of privately owned helicopters – hired thanks to a crowdfunding campaign and funds from Mick Fanning, Chris Hemsworth and the Essential Energy state-owned corporation, among others. Local helicopter pilots have been volunteering their time, and their presence in the skies across the flood-affected region is dwarfing the official Australian defence force contingent. By Sunday, the 14 community-organised helicopters, and a handful of other private aircraft, were averaging seven hours in the air each day running drops and performing rescues to towns such as Coraki, Bungawalbin and New Italy. Meanwhile, radar showed the ADF had just two helicopters in the air, and private helicopters contracted by government agencies for flood recovery that were parked in nearby Casino were averaging just one hour in the air each day. The ADF’s slow rollout has frustrated locals in the northern rivers who see many of their unpaid – and some untrained neighbours – filling the gaps in the impossibly large task of flood recovery across the area. On Sunday, Roger Mohr of V2 Helicopters was one of the volunteer pilots flying west from Lismore performing emergency food drops. Even on the ground, the smell left behind by the floods is still unpleasant. Strong sun and high humidity – apparent temperatures were at 35C – have been roasting the stagnant muddy water, sewage and rotting cows. Flying over the vast ocean of brown that the northern rivers region now resembles, the rising stench flows through Mohr’s aircraft as he passes above submerged power lines, abandoned cars and detached airplane wings strewn across fields. “The dead cattle is particularly unpleasant, it’s such a distinct smell,” he said. While many of the cows he flies over are already dead, some are alive but emaciated, stuck on small land islands with no food. He records their location, to alert the community effort at the hangar, as they are also organising feed drops for stranded cattle. While performing an airdrop on Saturday, Mohr and a co-pilot became stranded on a rural property that has been transformed into an island by the floods. They spent the night there, and continued flying drop missions on Sunday, including to cut-off Bungawalbin.

At his hangar, Barnes is also frustrated at the slow and comparatively smaller ADF rollout. “We don’t know where they are, have you seen them?” he said. Barnes’ wife, Jess, evacuated with their children to family in Melbourne, and has been helping coordinate the community helicopter effort from there. She explains that many of the people requiring rescue now thought they could last on their own in their properties until flood waters receded. The waters have proved stubborn. “They’re now realising the waters could last and they’re running out of supplies and are still totally cut off from roads.” She is also furious, observing the radar remotely and seeing how the region is having to rely on community volunteering. “We’re not making any money out of this, we’re the ones who started and said let’s just get as much as stuff as we can to the people we hear are still out there. We didn’t even think about the money when we started. “I cannot figure out why the ADF and SES [the volunteer-led state emergency service] aren’t out there searching for people. It drives me absolutely mental that they aren’t out there searching, because I am getting messages from mothers with their babies needing rescue who haven’t heard from an agency since the floods.” Barnes has also heard reports of the ADF coming to the hangar and around Lismore “for photo ops”. “They made it look like they were doing something and left right after taking a photo.” Back at the hangar, just before torrential rain broke through the hot Lismore day on Sunday afternoon, Jones was weaving through the piles of donations and boxes that were beginning to feel like supermarket aisles, consulting others about whether they could perform a rescue that had been requested. “Can we get here?” she asks, as she plans another mission.",News/Australia news,Locals take charge of helicopter food and rescue operations in NSW floods amid frustration over ADF efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/07/locals-take-charge-of-helicopter-food-and-rescue-operations-in-nsw-floods-amid-frustration-over-adf-efforts
3/7/2022,"Dele Alli first saw the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium at the end of March 2019 – just before the opening game against Crystal Palace. He did not want to see it half-done; he had chosen to wait until it was finished in order to enjoy the full impact. It would blow him away. Inside the empty bowl, Alli’s eyes were drawn towards the 17,500-capacity South Stand and he knew what he was most looking forward to – seeing it packed and scoring in front of it. It is reflective of how Alli’s Spurs career fizzled out that he managed to do so only twice – the late equaliser against Watford in October 2019 and the touch and finish in the win over Bournemouth the following month. The pandemic got in the way. His penalty in the 7-2 Europa League victory over Maccabi Haifa in October 2020 was witnessed by zero fans and it should be said that Alli scored six goals at the other end – mainly with supporters in attendance. But as Alli prepares to return with Everton for Monday night’s Premier League fixture, the feeling is that professional life got in his way, things becoming too heavy and serious, stifling the joy and mischief that had made him one of the symbols of the cherished team that Mauricio Pochettino built. The Alli who was shuffled out of the door to Goodison Park at the end of January on a permanent and initially free transfer bore no relation to the one who had arrived at Spurs in the summer of 2015, aged 19, and proceeded to fire a meteoric rise. For the Spurs fans who adored him and will always remember him with fondness, it is a source of profound regret. Alli’s connection with Pochettino and the Spurs support was instant and it was based on two things: an insatiable hunger to prove that he belonged at the highest level and a fearlessness to impose himself, to try all of his moves – no matter how outrageous. Alli reported for fitness training several days each week during June of his first Spurs pre-season while the other players were off. He wanted to push himself to the limit, to work as hard as possible, to run further than anybody else. At his previous club, MK Dons, he had smashed the running records and Pochettino quickly recognised him as the fittest member of his squad. What Alli did on his first Spurs start has been well told – the nutmeg on Real Madrid’s Luka Modric in the showpiece friendly in front of 70,000 people at Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena. It was the first evidence of the breathtaking cheek of a midfielder whom Sir Alex Ferguson would describe as the finest he had seen since Paul Gascoigne. At his best, during his first three seasons in north London, Alli made the game look fun and Spurs fans gorged on the memorable moments – mainly the goals, some of them spectacular and in massive matches. But there were also the flashes of skill, often improvised and off the cuff, that cemented his popularity. He played with a glorious freedom of spirit but also a provocative edge and he loved to wind up opposition players and supporters. “Dele Alli is Dele Alli because he’s a little bit naughty,” Pochettino said in December 2016. “Does he need that naughtiness? Yes, in context – don’t cross the line. But this is a little bit his identity.” During the lost times that have broadly followed the 2018 World Cup, when Alli was a part of the England team that reached the semi-finals – he scored in the quarter-final win over Sweden – it has been easy to wonder where the driven and often irrepressible rascal has gone. And why. There have still been flickers but, too often, Alli has just coasted through games. It has all been strangely vanilla. Every player changes after the big contract. So the saying goes. But the drop-off in Alli’s numbers after he renewed his Spurs deal in October 2018 until 2024 was pronounced. It was the contract that took him into huge six-figure-a-week territory and the one Everton have essentially taken over. Before he signed it, Alli had scored 48 goals for Spurs, 38 in the Premier League. After it, he would add 19 – with only 13 in the league. Alli had problems under all the managers after Pochettino. José Mourinho notoriously asked if he was Dele or Dele’s brother in an attempt to motivate him. After an encouraging start, Alli faded. Nuno Espírito Santo tried to repurpose him as a box-to-box midfielder but it did not work, and Antonio Conte could not see any of the old swagger or spark. They cannot all have been wrong. There is reaching the top level, playing in the Champions League and the major international tournaments, and there is sustaining it, continuing to make the sacrifices. The deal that took Alli to Everton was extraordinary because it seemed like a try-before-you-buy for the Merseyside club. They will pay £10m only when Alli has made 20 appearances, which, because he is Cup-tied, was never going to happen before the end of the season. The fee could rise to about £30m if individual and team targets are met. What if Everton decided to sell Alli in the summer? Would Spurs get anything? It feels inconceivable that Daniel Levy would not have covered his club in that eventuality. But the bottom line is that the Spurs chairman was happy to remove the remaining value of Alli’s contract from the books – a figure of anywhere between £12.5m and £20m, depending on whom you believe. It was a pragmatic decision over a player who stirs such romanticism, one who was loved by teammates and staff at Spurs, whom the fans lauded for having “only cost five mil” and being “better than Özil”. Alli has the rare knack of being able to engage with virtually anybody and it was noticeable how new signings at Spurs would invariably gravitate towards him. With his love of clothes, cars, music and gaming, Alli is immersed in popular culture, sometimes leading it, and his wider appeal to different age categories has long been clear. Alli’s star has burned impossibly brightly, which not too many people can say. Can he rekindle it at Everton, where he is yet to start a game? There would be no better place to begin the process than in front of the South Stand and, were he to score, it is questionable whether anyone there would begrudge him.",Sport/Football,Dele Alli still missing his mojo as he faces emotional Spurs reunion,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/06/dele-alli-still-missing-his-mojo-as-he-faces-emotional-spurs-reunion
3/7/2022,"Frank Lampard believes Everton’s poor away form has created a deep-rooted pessimism that must be overcome for the team to pull clear of relegation trouble. Everton have lost their two Premier League away games under Lampard, at Newcastle and Southampton, although their problems on the road predate the latest manager. The relegation-threatened team have the Premier League’s worst away record – winning once in 12 matches and collecting six points from a possible 36 – and visit Tottenham on Monday in desperate need of a result. A more positive mindset will be key to that aim, Lampard insists. “The away form is something that won’t necessarily be changed overnight,” he said. “There are reasons why we’re not getting results. I think some of those are confidence or mentality issues, and when I say mentality it’s not a negative thing, it’s just about how we handle games as a group away from home. Some of them it’s the structure of the team and how we set up, and it’s certainly my responsibility to get that right. But that’s one that we do work on. “Having said that, if we can get some traction and can get a result, whatever that may be in a positive sense, I think that really helps the change because at the minute there’s a feeling throughout the club of: ‘We’re going away from home, we may lose this game.’ That’s the first thing we have to broach. If we can broach that with the result then I think we can maybe really start taking that step forward. We don’t want to be a soft touch, that’s for sure.” Everton have impressed at home since Lampard replaced Rafael Benítez but he admits their previous away performance, a 2-0 defeat at Southampton, was the worst of his brief reign and that lessons must be learned. “We didn’t play as I want us to play, and the players knew that,” he said. “We had a meeting two days after that game to quickly see what went wrong and I think the players understood. “Whether it would have won or lost us that game, or made a difference, I don’t know, but I know for sure we could have changed our performance levels in that game. The players know. Tactically, there were issues with the team as the game went on that I certainly spoke about afterwards and that’s something that we must improve.”",Sport/Football,"Everton’s dire away form ‘won’t change overnight’, warns Frank Lampard",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/06/evertons-dire-away-form-wont-change-overnight-warns-frank-lampard
3/7/2022,"Boris Johnson has pledged to send more defensive equipment and $100m to Ukraine to hold off Russian troops and mitigate financial pressures facing the country, but was accused of moving too slowly and timidly to clamp down on oligarchs’ dirty money in the UK. Emergency legislation is due to be rushed through the House of Commons on Monday, intended to create a register of overseas ownership of UK land and property, reform unexplained wealth orders and make it easier to prosecute those involved in breaking sanctions. The economic crime bill will be supported by opposition parties, but ministers were warned it would still give those suspected of money laundering a “get out of London free card” and contained loopholes that could let people disguise or liquidate their assets before the new powers come into effect. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said he was frustrated ministers were “going slowly” and that there were “echoes of Afghanistan”, claiming the government “really only begins to get its act together and respond in the heat of the situation rather than preparing for it beforehand”. Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, said on Sunday it could take months or even years for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to be defeated in his ambition to conquer Ukraine. Raab said anyone who thought the crisis would be resolved in days was “deluding themselves” and that western nations would need to “show some strategic stamina”, even though Moscow’s military campaign had “stuttered”. Johnson will host meetings in No 10 with Nato leaders – Canada’s Justin Trudeau and the Netherlands’ Mark Rutte – on Monday to keep up the international pressure on Russia to end its war on the edge of eastern Europe. The prime minister said that since the invasion began nearly two weeks ago, the world had stood “tall in solidarity with the indomitable people of Ukraine”. During a call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Johnson also raised concern over “the increasing threat Russia’s barbaric attacks pose to Ukrainian civilians” and blamed Putin’s forces for breaching ceasefires relied upon for helping international aid reach those stuck without food, water and electricity for days. In an effort to clamp down on the vast sums of Russian money opaquely invested in the UK, the home secretary, Priti Patel, vowed that the upcoming economic crime bill would “go after the oligarchs”. The measures have been welcomed by many, given transparency campaigners have long complained that foreign investors have been able to hide their wealth in UK property, using shell companies and other complicated legal structures to conceal the identity of the real owners. Under the plans expected to be passed in a single day by MPs, a new register will be created that will list the foreign owners of any property bought in the last 20 years, or since 2014 in Scotland. Reform of the unexplained wealth orders system would also come into force, given no such order has been issued since the end of 2019. The changes will make it easier for authorities to confiscate criminal assets. However, some policies have been held back for a second economic crime bill. Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said the current plan to give oligarchs a six-month grace period to register their UK property would give “Putin’s cronies months to sell up and escape sanctions”. He called for the window to be cut to 28 days and said the Conservatives were in effect giving allies of the Russian president a “get out of London free card”. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said there was at least £1.1bn of property in the capital linked to the Kremlin, along with millions of pounds’ worth of goods such as art, cars and boats. He targeted the planned 30-day “wind-down period” for companies to conclude business arrangements before sanctions come into effect, adding that it was “completely unacceptable that ministers are offering them such easy loopholes to disguise or liquidate their assets before the state can act”. Meanwhile, Tory and Labour backbenchers have swung behind an amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats. MP Layla Moran said it was “farcical” that another loophole existed allowing the government to grant exemptions to individuals that would otherwise feature on the register of beneficial ownership for overseas entities if it is “in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the UK”. Cross-party support has also been secured by ex-ministers David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, and Liam Byrne, Labour’s former chief secretary to the Treasury, for an amendment to clamp down on so-called “lawfare”. The pair want to stop oligarchs using the English court system to silence their critics, including journalists uncovering their business dealings. The Guardian revealed last week that the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was pushing for a swift overhaul of the powers, but Raab has only committed to opening a call for evidence on reforming them in weeks.",News/Politics,Johnson steps up Ukraine support but is accused of slowness on Russian dirty money,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/06/johnson-steps-up-ukraine-support-but-is-accused-of-slowness-on-russian-dirty-money
