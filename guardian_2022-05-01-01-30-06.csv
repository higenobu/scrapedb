5/1/2022,"Gloucester can continue to dream. This 10-try bonus-point victory, secured by half-time against unbelievably ragged West Country rivals, maintains their hope of the playoffs in what promises to be a fiendishly close finale in the top-four race. Nothing less than five points would have done, realistically, after Northampton’s nerve-jangling win against Harlequins on Friday. But this was sheer destruction, and Gloucester’s biggest margin of victory in the Premiership. With third-placed Harlequins facing two difficult matches against Exeter and Gloucester, anything is possible. Having lifted themselves into fifth, a point behind Saints, the Cherry and Whites will carry confidence from this astonishingly one-side derby triumph. Bath remain rock-bottom, swatted aside with ludicrous ease. The incoming head coach, Johann van Graan, will arrive from Munster in the summer with a job on his hands. There is no shortage of raw material, especially in the backs, and world-class back-rowers such as Sam Underhill and Taulupe Faletau are hardly weak links. But this collapse will be the most painful defeat of a traumatic season. Last year, Eddie Jones memorably likened Mark Atkinson to a man running for a bus. He “had things falling out of his back pack” in his desperation to prove himself for the national side, Jones said, and the powerful Gloucester centre was in the thick of things from the off here. An intelligent delayed pass created an early opening for Louis Rees-Zammit, who unwisely chose to ignore teammates on either side. Valeriy Morozov, the Bath prop, had been shown a yellow card for a high tackle after three minutes and a well-orchestrated Gloucester driving maul culminated in Matias Alemanno burrowing over, only for the TMO to rule out the score for a double movement. Chris Harris almost sprinted under the posts but was dragged down by a brilliant tackle by Faletau. Gloucester finally got off the mark, having been frustrated throughout a spell of significant early pressure, when Harris dived over and Adam Hastings converted. Clark, the Bath centre, was shown a yellow card for a trip at the same time, meaning he disappeared from the action just as Morozov returned. Still, Bath trailed by seven points after enduring 20 minutes with a man disadvantage. Rees-Zammit’s early blunder would be a distant memory by half-time. After Bath got themselves in a muddle at a defensive lineout, Hastings popped a smart offload to the Wales international who danced over in the left corner. Inside the final five minutes of the half, when Tom de Glanville was turned over, Rees-Zammit kicked ahead and brushed off Joe Cokanasiga to dive on his second and Gloucester’s third try. He narrowly failed to snatch a hat-trick a couple of minutes later but when Atkinson’s one-handed offload set up Santiago Carreras to canter over and seal the bonus point before the break. Less than a minute after half-time, Rees-Zammit fed Ben Morgan for try No 5 and the Wales wing was nearly in again a couple of minutes later, hauled down in the right corner only for Atkinson to run in a jaw-droppingly easy try after Underhill rushed out of Bath’s defensive line. Lewis Ludlow, the captain, sauntered over for the seventh and kicked an advertising board to pieces during his passionate celebration. A lovely passing move sent Ben Meehan over , bringing up Gloucester’s 50 with 12 minutes on the clock, before Jamal Ford-Robinson got to the front of the queue to crash over and Alemanno romped over for the 10th, Bath’s humiliation complete. The home crowd headed for the bars dreaming of glory at the Premiership final in seven weeks’ time.",Sport/Sport,Rampant Gloucester run in 10 tries past Bath for record Premiership win,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/gloucester-bath-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
5/1/2022,"Burnley launched a stirring comeback with two goals in the last 10 minutes earning a priceless victory in their quest to beat the drop. The result condemned Watford to a top-flight record 11th successive home defeat. Seven points from three previous matches under Burnley’s interim manager Mike Jackson, following the surprise dismissal of Sean Dyche, had lifted the team outside the relegation places and their powers of recovery continued with this dramatic turnaround. Late goals from Jack Cork and Josh Brownhill effectively relegated Watford and also provided a huge boost to Burnley’s survival hopes, stretching their advantage over 18th-placed Everton to five points. Burnley were forced into a late change just before kick-off with Jay Rodriguez, injured in the warmup, replaced in their attack by the former Watford forward Matej Vydra. The home side started with a purpose and intensity which was not in keeping with a team on an abject losing run at Vicarage Road stretching back to November. Roy Hodgson has claimed Watford have been unlucky on several occasions, during their miserable run, but fortune certainly favoured them with the opening goal. Kiko Femenía’s cross was thundered towards goal by Juraj Kucka and the midfielder’s strike cannoned back off the crossbar, then into the net via James Tarkowski. Burnley were cursing their luck but Watford’s breakthrough was reward for their early intensity which has been sorely lacking during a bleak winter. There was a verve and energy to Watford’s play which bamboozled Burnley in the early stages. João Pedro broke through on goal, following a long punt down the pitch by Ben Foster, but the forward blasted his shot over Nick Pope’s crossbar. The referee, Craig Pawson, awarded a penalty to Burnley midway through the first half for a challenge by Moussa Sissoko on Dwight McNeil. Watford earned a reprieve, however, with VAR ruling Sissoko’s foul came marginally outside the area. McNeil blasted his free-kick against the wall to emphasise a frustrating first half-hour for Burnley. Emmanuel Dennis’s persistence almost paid off for Watford with the forward forcing Pope into a save at his near post. Pope also had to be alert to push Imran Louza’s free-kick to safety at the end of the first half. Burnley spurned a glorious chance to equalise immediately after the restart with Aaron Lennon bursting clear but the winger’s low shot was superbly saved by Foster. Watford hit back and the industrious Kucka was only denied a goal by Pope’s parry and the midfielder’s follow-up effort was blocked. The visitors sensed a way back into this match, exerting increasing control as the contest progressed but Watford still offered an occasional threat on the counterattack. Hodgson’s side appeared content to drop deep and play on the break but their inability to keep a clean sheet at home in the league this season was fraying the nerves of the home supporters. Ashley Barnes’s close-range header from a corner was turned on to the crossbar by the excellent Foster. But Burnley’s pressure eventually told late on with Charlie Taylor’s sweeping cross headed into the net by Cork against his former club. Burnley sensed Watford had run out of steam and the rampant visitors struck again with Vydra teeing up Brownhill for his fierce winning strike. Watford’s unwanted record was another grim day for their sorry supporters but Burnley have all the momentum, after three successive wins, and Everton could struggle to catch them in this mood.",Sport/Football,Burnley boost survival hopes after Josh Brownhill seals late fightback at Watford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/watford-burnley-premier-league-match-report
5/1/2022,"A Stormont candidate was grabbed by the throat in a terrifying “sectarian and misogynistic” attack while out canvassing. Hannah Kenny, standing for the People Before Profit party, said the assault took place last Saturday while she was delivering election material in east Belfast. She said she was surrounded by three men who gripped her by the arm and throat before threatening more violence against her if they saw her in the area again. A statement from the party said: “This incident took place on Saturday afternoon as our party activists were out around doors promoting our election message, in an area that – like many working-class communities on both sides of the sectarian divide – has suffered decades of austerity and deprivation under Stormont. “Hannah was approached by three men who subjected her to a terrifying ordeal, both sectarian and misogynistic in nature. They blocked her path, gripping her by the arm and throat before detailing the violence they would subject her to if she returned to the area.” Kenny said she was “deeply distressed” by the level of aggression shown towards her and that the men told her she had been identified from election campaign posters. “Unfortunately, there exists a minority intent on polarising this election along familiar lines,” she said. “We have seen other election candidates attacked and threatened, with posters being damaged in various places. “These aren’t just attacks on individuals like myself, they are attacks on the democratic process intended to take us backward.” The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it was reported that a female was verbally abused and threatened by three men while distributing election material. It added that the report included allegations of physical and verbal assault, including both sectarian and misogynistic comments. Ch Insp Mark Roberts said: “We have contacted the political parties to proactively offer briefing sessions and information for candidates on crime prevention and personal safety, and our officers will continue to offer support and advice at a local level. “Inquiries are ongoing and at this time we are treating this as a hate crime. “We are appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident or who has any dashcam or mobile footage, or any information which could assist, to contact us on 101.” The PA Media news agency contributed to this report.",News/UK news,Stormont candidate ‘grabbed by throat’ while canvassing,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/30/stormont-candidate-hannah-kenny-grabbed-by-throat-while-canvassing
5/1/2022,"Norwich City’s latest relegation to the Championship was confirmed after their defeat at Villa Park, courtesy of goals from Ollie Watkins and Danny Ings, and Burnley’s late win at Watford. Although Dean Smith, returning to the club he left behind in November, saw his current side play with courage and dominate possession in the second half, Aston Villa deserved their first win in six games after creating the vast majority of clearcut chances. Norwich’s third demotion in six years comes as no great surprise and their supporters sang with gusto in the latter stages as they tried to cheer their team to gain the equaliser that would have extended their survival hopes for another week. But they were simply not good enough, all over the park, as they fell to a third successive defeat. The all-important first goal came via an enforced change, after an injury to Leon Bailey, that reaped an immediate dividend for Villa as a first touch from Ings, the substitute, led to Watkins firing home his 10th Premier League goal of the season. Watkins was a live-wire all day, volleying just over in the sixth minute and constantly threatening to get in behind, and his goal always looked likely to provide the springboard for Villa to play on the counter-attack. The England striker’s explosive finish came within a minute of a substitution that encouraged Steven Gerrard to make a key tactical change. Bailey, who saw a superb left-foot shot tipped on to the crossbar by Tim Krul as Villa chased an early breakthrough, had to go off. The emergence of Ings allowed Villa to switch to a midfield diamond, with Philippe Coutinho at the tip. Ings took up a position high and wide on the left and his first contribution was a long diagonal pass that sent Watkins running away in to the inside-right channel in a one-on-one battle with Brandon Williams. As Watkins headed the ball up, Williams slipped, and Villa’s leading scorer composed himself before lashing home a right-foot shot, diverted slightly off the covering Sam Byram, high into the net. Ings headed against a post early in the second half as Villa continued to make chances, even as they allowed Norwich more of the ball in front of them. With just four points from their last 11 games, Norwich came closest to scoring when Emi Martínez made a brilliant save from Milot Rashica midway through the first-half, but Villa deserved the win, which was sealed in stoppage time when Emi Buendía’s attempted control fell for Ings to swivel and shoot home. There was a nice touch after the final whistle as the Villa fans applauded Smith for his previous reign here. But that will have been scant consolation as he starts to prepare for life in the Championship.",Sport/Football,Norwich relegated after Ollie Watkins and Danny Ings secure Aston Villa win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/aston-villa-norwich-premier-league-match-report

5/1/2022,"A rescue of a drowning baby otter from a near-freezing river in Minnesota was remarkable not only for the successful outcome but for the identity of the rescuer – a tiny three-legged dog waging its own battle for survival with cancer. Wildlife officials said the otter would likely not have survived without the intervention of Gus, a six-year-old goldendoodle that had one of its back legs amputated earlier this year because of tumors. The dog’s owner, Cleo Young, told CBS affiliate WCCO she feared her pet was “not going to be able to run like he used to” after surgery and chemotherapy. On Easter Sunday, however, Gus swam into the St Croix river in Lakeland after spotting the newborn otter struggling. “He came to shore and he had something in his mouth, and it turned out to be a very tiny otter,” Young said. Young’s granddaughter Lucy told the station: “He was going after something, it was clear, but we didn’t know at first. He was really gentle. And I think he knew it needed help, and so he brought it right to us.” The family took the otter to the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Roseville, after which it was sent to another facility for more intense treatment. Staff told Young the dog’s intervention almost certainly saved the otter’s life because it could not have survived in the water outside its mother’s den. Young said the family’s efforts were now turning back to Gus’s own preservation, with more sessions of chemotherapy to complete.",News/US news,Three-legged dog with cancer saves baby otter in Minnesota river drama,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/30/three-legged-dog-cancer-saves-baby-otter-minnesota-river
5/1/2022,"Lives Less Ordinary (BBC World Service) | BBC SoundsDon’t Log Off: Daria – Love and War (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsLady Killers With Lucy Worsley (Radio 4) | BBC Sounds Other people. Strange, aren’t they? Strange, and much more interesting than yourself. If you’re in search of these fascinating weirdos, then Outlook is – was – a daily World Service interview programme that provides hundreds of interviews for you to binge, each programme featuring the story of one riveting ordinary person, from a disaster expert to a turtle custodian. Some of the stories were covered elsewhere (trans man Freddy McConnell’s tale of giving birth, for example), but Outlook held its own. It was a lovely show, but quite old World Service. Its nicely vowelled interviewers politely probed their subjects in a cool BBC manner. Which is fine, but not as ear-catching as it might be. But now the show’s been rethought and – ta-da! – emerged last week having morphed into a weekly podcast called Lives Less Ordinary. A much better title, and, perhaps because there’s more time on a weekly show, the production team has added other contemporary details. Some dashes of background music for tension, a spot of recreated atmosphere. Plus, there’s a new host, Mobeen Azhar, joining Jo Fidgen and Emily Webb, two Outlook veterans. It’s Azhar who kicks off Lives Less Ordinary with a crackerjack tale: that of Tom Justice, a middle-class American who, in the late 1990s, started robbing banks, for no particular reason at all. (And yes, his tale has been covered before, notably on Love + Radio’s Choir Boy.) Justice didn’t need the money. He had the talent to do something better – he was an expert cyclist. But somewhere along the line, he’d watched two films that got under his skin. First, the grunge romcom Reality Bites, which clicked with his slacker mentality, and, second, Heat, the gloss-to-the-max Robert De Niro/Al Pacino vehicle that gave him the idea: “It unlocked the fantasy in me.” Justice had nearly made it to the Olympics but hadn’t had the discipline. Robbing a bank was, to his mind, more him. Somewhere deep inside, he thought he was a film antihero. As you can imagine, it all goes wrong, though not as quickly as you might assume. Justice’s story is a great ride (he confesses to being more scared of his mum than the police) and Azhar is an excellent interviewer, his upbeat, cheeky approach masking the fact that he asks all the right questions. We’re left with a cliffhanger, to be concluded this week (another contemporary podcast trope). An excellent start. Over on Radio 4, Alan Dein, extraordinary interviewer of ordinary people, is back with another series of Don’t Log Off. Dein is the expert at talking to unknown heroes, teasing out their stories, making them shine. His series Lives in a Landscape, also on Radio 4, has provided several of my favourite radio moments; Aftermath, too. And Don’t Log Off is always worth a listen. It started 20 years ago, as Don’t Hang Up, where the redoubtable Dein called random phone boxes across the UK and tried to talk to whoever picked up. After a decade, he swapped to Don’t Log Off, and chatted to people online (actually talking, not just texting). He’s kept in touch with some. One of these is Daria, who lives in south-eastern Ukraine. Dein first connected with her in 2012, and we meet her again now. She is delightful, a living ray of sunshine, though her life is not without difficulties: she’s in a wheelchair, she had cancer, she once had a tricky relationship with her dad. Since February, of course, her life has become even more difficult, though she is still, unbelievably, a happy audio presence. I was very moved by her description of her boyfriend, from how they met to how they live now, with her parents, ears always open for the sound of sirens. Sometimes he has to pick her up and carry her to the air-raid shelter. She dreams, she says, of travelling in the future, “as a tourist – not, God forbid, as a refugee – as a proud Ukranian”, and of meeting Dein in person. Unmissable. Also on Radio 4, historian Lucy Worsley has a new series, Lady Killers, about female murderers of the past. Women don’t tend to kill, so you can’t call these women ordinary, but the first case, at least, was very domestic. Florence Bravo was a Victorian woman who became rich when her first husband died. When she married her second, things went a bit off, and one evening husband No 2 ended up dead, from poisoning. So: did she or didn’t she? Worsley went through inquest records, and in the manner of The Long View asked lawyers and experts how such a case would play out in court and in the media today. The result was fun, if rather inconclusive. Today’s coercive control laws might have helped Bravo. But the media’s sneery picking over of how a woman presents herself (Bravo was deemed to be past her prime) does not seem to have changed all that much.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: Lives Less Ordinary; Don’t Log Off; Lady Killers With Lucy Worsley,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/30/lives-less-ordinary-tom-justice-world-service-dont-log-off-alan-dein-daria-love-and-war-lady-killers-with-lucy-worsley-florence-bravo
5/1/2022,"Ionly watched Heartstopper, the lovely Netflix series about a teenage boy’s crush on a male classmate that grows into something more, because I was reviewing it. I suspect that I might have otherwise assumed the series was for teenagers and skipped past. In the end, I was very glad I didn’t skip it – it is irresistibly sweet and sincere – but I did wonder, at the time, who the audience would be. Alice Oseman adapted it from her own series of YA graphic novels, which are hugely popular. But would teenagers watch something so wholesome? Would adults watch something so youthful? Netflix is famously coy about who watches what so this is purely anecdotal, but over the last couple of weeks I have been surprised at how many of my fully grown adult friends have mentioned Heartstopper. Perhaps it shouldn’t have been such a shock. For years, adults have tentatively admitted to reading YA or even children’s fiction – one study, from 2012, found that 55% of YA fiction readers were over 18 – and there have always been adult editions of His Dark Materials and Harry Potter, for example, with more muted jackets. (I loved His Dark Materials so much that I named my dog after one of its characters, so I hold my own hand up to that one.) The reactions have broadly appeared along two lines. One is that older LGBTQ+ viewers are so glad that it exists at all, for the generations that have come after them. To see something so honest about teenagers figuring out who they fancy, and what that means for them, is such a relief. If it helps even a handful of kids not to hate themselves for who they are, then it is a marvel. But there is a kind of sadness that we didn’t have that experience as teenagers. “Can you imagine that being on TV when we were younger?” is what I keep hearing, the gratitude ever so slightly tinged with grief for what we did not have. These days, there are more queer characters on screen than I can recall, but many millennials were starved of “representation”, the idea that it matters for viewers to see characters who might be going through what they were going through. Plenty of us recall watching terrible films or TV shows in the hope that there would be even a hint of gay subtext, only to be disappointed in the end. How amazing, then, that Heartstopper exists, and so casually, too. Can you imagine? The Crown is finally catching up with itself. According to Variety, the royal melodrama has put out a casting call for a young Kate Middleton, who will appear in season six. “This is a good role in this award-winning drama and we are looking for a strong physical resemblance,” it said, which does feel like the bare minimum. Mind you, anyone who caught the 2011 TV film William & Kate will be aware that the bare minimum should do it. The fact that they are casting a Middleton means it is getting within touching distance of the present day. Looking at the young Queen’s life had the imperial remove of a period drama, but the closer it gets to events that practically happened last week (if there’s a casting call for Emily Maitlis, then you know it’s getting real), the more strange it all starts to feel. It could embrace that, of course. I would watch an episode of The Crown that saw the current royals watching their younger selves on The Crown; it would be like an upper-crust Gogglebox with a Being John Malkovich twist. The problem it might run into is that people are less forgiving of interpretations of real events when such events are so fresh in the mind. Last week, Viola Davis defended herself against criticisms of her portrayal of Michelle Obama in the US series The First Lady, while also acknowledging that it was “almost impossible” to play someone so familiar. TV drama is in love with telling true stories right now, but it might find more freedom in making things up again. The biggest news to emerge from this year’s CinemaCon was either the return of Top Gun (quite good, apparently) or Olivia Wilde being served legal papers while on stage, which appeared deeply unpleasant and awkward. But the most peculiar news was the confirmation that Hollywood’s oddest-sounding feature film is real and not a figment of fevered imaginations. It feels as if it has been in the works for years, but we finally got a first-look picture of Margot Robbie as Barbie, yes, that Barbie, in the movie that is also called Barbie and news that it will be released in cinemas next year. The picture shows Robbie driving a pink convertible car, so she is sitting down, but even so, it looks as if she is in fact able to walk without her disproportionately tiny bones collapsing under the pressure of standing up, which, in some previous iterations of the doll, did look doubtful. Barbie is directed by arthouse darling Greta Gerwig and co-written by Gerwig and Marriage Story’s Noah Baumbach, neither of whom is known for their saccharine streak. I am sort of thrilled by the fact that it is completely impossible to imagine what it is going to be like.

5/1/2022,"Bruno Lage had urged his Wolves players to seize the moment, comparing their run in to the 100m sprint but his side look set to splutter over the line and miss out on Europe after slipping to a third successive defeat. Wolves were maddening and muddled and this latest perplexing performance hinders their fading hopes of returning to a European competition. A first-half penalty by Alexis Mac Allister, who also rattled the upright from the spot, a smart finish from Leandro Trossard and a late drive by Yves Bissouma helped a business-like Brighton coast to a victory that keeps Graham Potter’s side on course for their highest ever top-flight finish. Willy Boly’s header on 85 minutes – Wolves’ first effort on target – was sarcastically jeered but seconds later, when Bissouma wrapped up victory from the edge of the box, the home seats emptied. Those left groaned upon confirmation of three minutes of stoppage time. With West Ham and Manchester United not in action until Sunday and Monday respectively, this was a chance for Wolves to finally apply some heat, having allowed their rivals off the hook by losing six of their previous nine matches. What a mess they made of it. Wolves have a game in hand on United but with trips to Chelsea and Liverpool to come either side of home matches against Manchester City and Norwich, the home straight threatens to be relatively fruitless. Wolves were booed off at half-time and Lage appeared to share supporters’ frustrations, arching his back on the corner of his technical area as Leander Dendoncker’s cross into the box eluded everybody in gold shirts. Wolves welcomed Rúben Neves back into midfield following a knee injury, three days after Lage ruled the Portuguese out of the game. The home fans started singing his name with 39 seconds on the clock but his return did not go to plan. Neves, grounded early on following a collision with Danny Welbeck on halfway, was replaced by Pedro Neto at the interval, when Raúl Jiménez also entered in place of the ineffective Fabio Silva. João Moutinho and Neves saw shots deflected wide but the hosts laboured in their attempts to penetrate Brighton and their anxiety in the final third transmitted to an unusually flat crowd. Things went from bad to worse on 52 minutes when Nélson Semedo limped off, forcing Lage into using his final substitution, with Jonny Otto introduced at wing-back. Wolves have long struggled going forward – no ground has seen fewer goals this season and so a goal glut was always unlikely – but some jittery defending allowed Brighton to take the lead from the penalty spot. There was consternation and concern in the Wolves dugout as the referee, Simon Hooper, awarded a penalty for a Romain Saïss handball following a visit to the VAR monitor but Mac Allister’s first spot-kick cannoned against a post. That moment briefly invigorated the home crowd but a minute later the Wolves goalkeeper José Sá was called into action, smartly saving Trossard’s low shot with his left boot. Sa then faced Mac Allister from 12 yards once more when Boly clipped Welbeck’s heels in the box. Mac Allister went the same way, to Sá’s right, but the goalkeeper could not keep the ball out. In the buildup Lage said had seen too many of the same game from his team, alluding to their struggles in front goal but this display was equally short of promise. Moutinho skittled a free-kick into the Brighton wall and, if anything typified Wolves’ weary performance, it was Neto’s daisy-cutter of a corner soon after that failed to beat the first man. Then came the killer blow. Welbeck, who quietly caused problems all afternoon, slipped in Trossard, who chopped inside Moutinho before rifling a shot into the far corner of Sá’s goal. With 17 long minutes to play, the olés from the Brighton fans rubbed salt into the wound, before Bissouma sealed a deserved victory over a toothless and tame Wolves side.",Sport/Football,"Mac Allister, Trossard and Bissouma on target in Brighton’s win at Wolves",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/wolves-brighton-premier-league-match-report
5/1/2022,"At 64, Chen Renping has lived in New York City’s Chinatown neighborhood for more than 20 years. But after a back injury forced him to retire from construction work in 2018, Renping can only afford rent if he works multiple part-time jobs – and that’s with his unit being rent stabilized. “Once I pay the rent, life is very hard,” Renping said, through a translator. Recently proposed rent increases of up to 9% prompted Renping to join a coalition protesters calling on New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, to roll back rising rent. “A lot of us can’t pay the rent and we can’t even buy food,” Renping said at a rally organized by the Rent Justice Coalition group at New York’s city hall park on Thursday. For the millions of New Yorkers living in rent stabilized buildings, many of whom are still financially recovering from disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, recently proposed rent hikes are stoking panic and widespread pushback throughout the city. New York’s Rent Guidelines Board (RGB), a nine-person, mayor-appointed board, votes annually on how much landlords can raise the rent of the city’s more than 900,000 rent stabilized units. For the past five years, the RGB has voted – at most – for a rent increase of 1.5% for one-year leases and 2% for two-year contracts, increases that New Yorkers say have already put added pressure on tight-squeezed paychecks. But, staff of this year’s RGB, with three new members appointed by Adams, have proposed hikes of 4.5% for one-year leases and up to 9% for two-year leases. Elected officials and tenants argue the added costs will displace a staggering number of residents. “Is the mayor’s goal to have hundreds of thousands of homeless people? Because if that’s his goal, he’s heading in the right direction,” said Pilar DeJesus, a senior advocacy coordinator at the organization Take Root Justice. DeJesus, who spoke at Thursday’s protest, said that is because many tenants are still grappling with income loss and financial stress amid the pandemic. “First, they were worrying about dying. Now they gotta worry about being homeless and dying on the street,” DeJesus said, adding that increased rent will exacerbate crime and mental health problems in the city. Julius P Bennett, a Bronx tenant who also spoke at Thursday’s rally, seconded the concerns of Renping and DeJesus. Bennett, whose income primarily comes from his pension and social security, said that he and other tenants in his building would have to move amid proposed rent increases. Bennett also said past rent increases have not prevented his building from falling into disrepair. “Nine per cent would be exorbitant,” said Bennett, who leads his building’s tenant union. Chi Ossé, a city council member who spoke at the protest, said that constituents in his district, which includes the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood and parts of Crown Heights, often report excessive rent increases that Ossé believes are unlawful. “We’ve been getting calls from tenants saying that their landlord was gonna increase the rent by $700 by the time May 1 comes around and we’re hearing even crazier prices,” said Ossé, adding that Bedford-Stuyvesant lost the most amount of Black residents out of any New York City neighborhood . Bennett, DeJesus and others who spoke at the rally also noted that tenants facing eviction often do not receive the competent counsel to which they are legally entitled. That would be only be worsened in light of higher rent and possible wave of new evictions. “Is that because we are the poor? You don’t have to provide for us, whatever the law says?” Bennett said. In response to a request for comment on how proposed rent increases would impact New Yorkers, the mayor’s office forwarded an answer Adams had given at a previous press conference: the RGB would only approve a proposal that wouldn’t increase evictions. Adams also added that rent increases were meant to support small-building landlords who were falling behind on their bills because the pandemic halted payments. “We don’t want to aggravate the eviction process, but we also got to look at small property owners,” Adams said at a 21 April press conference. “And sometimes when we think about landlords, we think about the mega guys … but these small mom and pops have been decimated.” But a 2018 analysis from the non-profit JustFix.nyc calls into question who the suggested increases would serve. The majority of rent-regulated apartments are owned by large landlords, defined as those who own more than 20 buildings, the analysis found. Adams’s office also noted that board members wouldn’t make a final decision until June and weren’t bound by their staff’s recommendations.
