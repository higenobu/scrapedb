3/13/2022,"In a modern-day twist on the age-old riddle: which came first? The cold, damp housing forced on people with the lowest incomes across the private rental sector or the upswing in respiratory illnesses? The lack of funds for a nourishing and balanced diet, or malnutrition and the return of Victorian-era illnesses such as rickets? The deliberate policies of penury and deprivation over the last 12 years of Conservative-led rule, or the emaciated bodies of those left to rot by the ideologues of unnecessary austerity? Numbers are cold, stark and loveless things; it’s easy for those in the halls of power to disassociate from a statistic and forget that each and every one of those numbers represents a hungry, traumatised, exhausted human being. Every one of the 3.8 million disabled people struggling to meet their most basic needs, the 4.3 million children and their parents living in poverty and the millions of people in work and yet are still scrabbling to survive. The Trussell Trust has consistently reported, for the last 10 years, that more than half the people referred to its food banks for emergency aid are there because they are in debt to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Those numbers have steadily increased year on year; not, as some MPs claim, because availability of food banks has increased. Food banks expand according to the need for them, not the other way around. Speaking on the BBC’s Politics Live on Wednesday, business minister Paul Scully claimed that the government was not going to balance the books of the economy on the backs of the poorest and most vulnerable. And I – who had only been sneaked on to the panel at the last minute after the work and pensions select committee meeting over the road – could barely contain my contempt for the audacity of the lie. This government has routinely balanced its books on the backs of those least able to shoulder the burdens, and the macabre and heartbreaking roll call of the names of those who have died as a result of the failures and cruelties of the DWP runs to the thousands. And if their deaths, and lives, are not learned from, than many, many more people will die in the months and years to come. Nobody who serves in the Houses of Parliament can pretend to be ignorant of the facts around the stratospheric rise in the need for food banks. None of you can pretend not to have noticed the neighbourhood food collection points in every single supermarket in the land. Not one of you can bluster that somehow the thousands of national newspaper articles about the state of the nation have somehow passed you by. And I suspect there is not a single member of parliament who has not heard from at least a dozen of their constituents about the increasingly desperate poverty they are living in. Ignorance is no longer a defence. And as long as one person in this country is going to bed cold, hungry, destitute and increasingly unwell, it is because of a conscious decision by those who claim to serve them not to use the power granted by the poorest of their constituents to make a radical and meaningful difference to their lives. Because you hold that power. It’s in the stroke of your pen, the votes in your chambers, the voices you can raise, the debts you can table, the whips you can decline. And as long as one single child in this country is going to bed cold and hungry, you’re making a conscious decision every single day not to use that power for those who have granted it to you.",Opinion/Opinion,The UK government is balancing its books on the backs of the poor | Jack Monroe,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/13/the-uk-government-is-balancing-its-books-on-the-backs-of-the-poor
3/13/2022,"When George Balanchine created his three-act ballet Jewels in 1967, he popped into the New York branch of the French jewellers Van Cleef & Arpels for the photoshoot. That moment cemented the relationship between the jewellery house and dance. Now, the company is scattering gems across London – not in the shape of its sapphire and diamond ballerina brooches (unfortunately) but in the form of a festival, featuring some contemporary classics and some pioneering new work. The opening night of Dance Reflections, curated by Serge Laurent, in collaboration with Sadler’s Wells, the Royal Opera House and Tate Modern, revealed its intent. Its centrepiece was a revival of Lucinda Childs’ Dance, made in 1979 and widely agreed to be one of the most significant and beautiful examples of “postmodern dance”, the re-examination of the principles of movement that began in New York in the 1960s. The directness of its title is matched by the purity of a concept that sets 17 dancers, identically dressed in white, moving across the stage to a commissioned score by Philip Glass. In the nearly 20-minute first section, they repeat a set of simple movements – a little jump, a straightening of the arms, a step – with tilting grace, making minimal variations in angle and timing that alter the patterns and shapes they make. Then there’s a long solo for one woman, walking forward, turning, bending, before an accelerating final section of almost rapturous intensity, with Beverly Emmons’s lighting suddenly changing from cool white through red and blue to warm yellows. The whole thing is encased by a 2016 recreation by Lyon Opera Ballet dancers of the 1979 Sol LeWitt film that provided the work’s original setting. The dancers are sometimes dwarfed by the huge figures projected on to a front screen, and sometimes wind among them. This has the effect of asking your brain to make complicated adjustments of space and trajectory, but the overall impression is contemplative. There’s a sense of falling into this endless, lovely movement. Childs took a curtain call, unbelievably glamorous at the age of 81, a true transformer of what we think of as dance. Neighbours, choreographed by its dancers, Brigel Gjoka and Rauf “RubberLegz” Yasit, in collaboration with William Forsythe, another transformative force, shares Childs’s preoccupation with the way the tiniest inflection of movement can change everything. In an early section, Gjoka, who is Albanian, raises his arm to give a series of waves, each one subtly different in meaning, sometimes conversational, sometimes questioning. Yasit is Kurdish-German, and this surprisingly emotional piece, performed with the Turkish musician Ruşan Filiztek, explores what binds neighbours together and what separates them. Different dance traditions also add texture, with Gjoka’s contemporary background giving his movements an astonishing fluent grace, full of beaten steps and fluid shifts of direction, while Yasit’s sensational hip-hop skills mean that he is more grounded but capable of defying gravity by a sudden one-armed handstand or a twisting of his legs so complicated you can’t quite work out what he’s done. Often they dance together, entwining their arms like one of those linked puzzles you have to undo. Or they find ways to touch hands, tapping each other’s limbs to set off a complex sequence of pose and counterpose. The sheer variety of what they manage, both in silence and to Filiztek’s haunting music, in solos and duets, is impressive and always engrossing. Riveting.

3/13/2022,"This is a story about me and a man in Walthamstow, northeast London. The man just happened to be master chocolatier Paul A Young and I went to his house to make chocolate. Largely, this involved me talking a lot while Paul did all the work of melting, tempering and pouring the chocolate into moulds. But I’m going to use the royal we. We melted some Valrhona chocolate and tempered it all over Paul’s marble counter top, and then we poured it into some splendid ‘Mars bar’ moulds (from Chocolate World). These moulds are so nostalgic they can’t fail to bring joy, I’m going to buy some and experiment with different fillings (caramel/biscuit/salted peanuts to start); these would make delicious little ‘desserts’ for when people come round. We ‘painted’ ours with metallic powder (from Keylink), but you don’t have to. We then filled them with a mixture of water ganache, feuilletine, which we spent many a minute trying to pronounce, let alone spell, and some Proper Nutty peanut butter. Then more chocolate to cap it. Then in the fridge for 15 minutes while we chatted about Paul’s past as a pastry chef, and chocolate we like. And then the bars were ready and we shared one and for a brief moment everything was right with the world, because they were truly wonderful. He packed them up for me as well as two brownies (Paul makes the best brownies ever) and I ate the last bar writing this column because I stay in character, just like Succession’s Jeremy Strong. shop.paulayoung.co.uk Follow Annalisa on Twitter @AnnalisaB",Lifestyle/Food,Notes on chocolate: a date with Walthamstow’s master chocolatier,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/13/notes-on-chocolate-annalisa-barbieri-walthamstows-master-chocolatier
3/13/2022,"At the Lehigh Valley Mall, on the outskirts of Allentown, Pennsylvania, Tony Saba is already feeling the impact of the rising cost of gas. “The price is going up to hell,” he said. “I cannot move like before. My car is in my garage. I can’t move it because I have no money.” Saba, a 70-year-old retiree, used to drive to the mall. He doesn’t go in any of the shops or restaurants – he just likes to sit in the comfy armchairs and chat with his friends. Now his car is out of commission, and he still wanted to come to the mall. But the bus takes too long, and is too expensive. So he called a friend, who picked him up. Saba’s story, in a nutshell, illustrates the problem many in America face. Owning and operating a car is getting more and more expensive as the oil price rises. The Russian invasion of Ukraine – and a resultant ban on Russian oil – will probably make things worse. But the US’s largely ineffective public transport means Americans have little choice but to use their cars. In the majority of the US, Americans need their vehicles to work, shop, study and survive. It’s a reliance that dates back decades. “In the US we really saw an increase in automobile use in the post-world war two period, the baby boom generation. At that point in time, we had this new availability of relatively inexpensive mass-produced automobiles, this is the first time that people from middle income households can purchase a motor vehicle,” said Gregory Rowangould, the director of the Transportation Research Center at the University of Vermont and an associate professor in civil and environmental engineering. “And at the same time you have soldiers returning from world war two, starting families, we have a huge population boom, so there’s also a need for more housing.” At the time many cities were polluted, noisy and generally less attractive, Rowangould said. It led to a boom in the construction of suburban housing: cars and the suburbs went hand in hand. “That has just been a pattern in the US that, once started, it’s been really persistent.” The construction and planning of these new suburbs rarely included viable bus or train options. Many new neighborhoods didn’t have walkable amenities either. Now, people needed cars to go shopping, or take their kids to the swimming pool, and certainly to get to work. It’s a legacy that has endured. Americans drive much, much more than other nationalities. In 2019 American motorists drove an average of 14,263 miles a year, according to the US Department of Transportation. That puts the US at the top of the list in terms of miles driven, and it isn’t even close. In the next highest country, Canada, people drove an average of 9,562 miles a year in 2018. The average car in the UK was driven for 7,134 miles in 2019. America’s reliance on cars and the current increase in gas prices will disproportionately affect those already struggling, Rowangould said. Lower-income households are forced to devote a larger share of their budget to transportation than wealthier households. “They’re more likely to own a vehicle that’s less fuel efficient and older, they have less ability to be able to purchase an electric vehicle, so it’s more difficult to acquire more fuel-efficient vehicles,” Rowangould said. In Pennsylvania the grassroots group Pittsburghers for Public Transit has called for investment in public transport to match the amounts spent on roads. According to a recent report by the group, 80% of federal transport funding goes to highways, and only 20% to public transit. Laura Chu Wiens, executive director of PPT, said the disparity has perpetuated America’s car dependency, and communities of color have suffered the most. “The households that are most reliant on public transit, or don’t have easy access to a car, are disproportionately low-income households, unsurprisingly, black households, undocumented immigrants,” Chu Wiens said. Most American cities have some form of bus service. But travel can frequently involve people having to take multiple buses, or trains, just to get to work – something which has serious consequences. It can also be unsafe due to poor transit investment. “They’re profoundly unsafe and undignified settings in which we ask transit riders to exist. And then not only that, we penalize them through things like fares for having worse-quality trips,” Chu Wiens said. A 2017 study by Harvard University found that commuting time was the most important factor in escaping poverty. As the New York Times put it: “The longer an average commute in a given county, the worse the chances of low-income families there moving up the ladder.” But even among those who own a car, many don’t enjoy driving, said Christof Spieler, director of planning at the Huitt-Zollars engineering company and author of Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US and Canadian Transit. “For a lot of people their commute is the most miserable part of their day,” Spieler said. Americans in favor of better public transport, and its benefits, may look to Europe or east Asia, where there are functioning subways, trams, bus systems and bike paths, and see little hope that the US will ever have the same. Car culture is too entrenched, some believe. There’s no money to build railways. But people shouldn’t be so quick to admit defeat, Spieler said. “One mistake a lot of people make is when they make the comparison to Japan, or they make the comparison to Europe, they assume these outcomes were much more inevitable than they were,” he said. “But in the United States we could easily have made different choices. If you look at Europe, a lot of places actually look like they were headed in the American direction.” Cities such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen are seen as incredibly bike friendly today, Spieler said, but in the 1960s “cars took over those cities”. The difference in those places is that there was “a moment of serious readjustment that happened in the 1970s and 80s of going in a different direction”. Another argument is that the sheer size of the US means public transport wouldn’t work. Anyone who has experienced Amtrak’s cross-country services – the rail company offers little-used, days-long trips from Los Angeles to New Orleans, and Chicago to Florida – can attest to the problems of scale. But having working public transport isn’t about linking the whole country, or about forcing bus routes down the throats of tiny villages. “There are some places where owning a car really is the right answer. A rancher in Wyoming really should own a car, or a pickup,” Spieler said. Most people are not ranchers in Wyoming, however. There are more than 50 cities in the US that have a metropolitan population of more than 1 million people, according to the 2020 census. Many of the people in those areas live in homes in the suburban sprawl, rather than in the city itself, however, and to really successfully implement a shift away from cars, some believe there has to be a shift in the very way we live – by moving people back towards the center of cities. “If we really want to move the needle on this, we are talking about people’s lives changing and we are talking about people living differently, and I don’t want to understate that,” Spieler said. Adie Tomer, Senior Fellow at Brookings Metro who leads the organization’s Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative, agreed that there was a need to change the way people live. People moving towards cities from the suburbs has to happen, Tomer said, and better rail and bus networks will follow. It might seem unrealistic, but there is hope. Tomer said that while suburbs, as it stands, “have won the day”, that doesn’t mean that, if given the choice, people would always choose a suburban life. “Cities are just cool in America,” Tomer said. “And that is still present in our culture, but our actual development doesn’t actually reflect that. According to Tomer, a “political window has opened”, caused by the gas prices surge, which could potentially lay the path for changes in how people understand living and transport. In a recent poll more than 60% of Americans said they were willing to suffer higher gas prices in order to continue to support Ukraine, a victory for Joe Biden, who has acknowledged that US support for Ukraine will mean prices continue to rise. Meanwhile some experts have suggested the spike in prices could serve as a wake-up call for the public and politicians to move away from a reliance on oil, and towards greener transport methods. “If there is real American conversation that is different from what we’ve had in almost 40 years, about conservation, taking public transit for energy reasons, it could be a different moment,” Tomer said. “Transportation is our number one source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. That’s different than any of our peers. So there could be a window here to at least start to change the trajectory of the conversation.” With gas prices unlikely to fall anytime soon, a shift away from America’s car dependency, and serious investment in public transport would not just benefit the environment, but also the millions of Americans who are struggling financially. An improvement in transport would mean people could get to work quicker, or take their children out for the day. For others, like Tony Saba, it would simply it easier to take a trip out to the Lehigh Valley Mall. “I used to come here every day. I would call a friend and say: ‘Meet me in the mall,’” he said. “I like it here. It’s social. It’s a nice life.”",News/US news,‘I can’t move my car’: Americans struggle as vehicle expenses rise,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/13/us-car-vehicle-expenses-rise
3/13/2022,"Professionals who want to retrain as paramedics are facing tough financial decisions after discovering they are barred from government funding. Many who were inspired by the pandemic to join the NHS say they are being treated as second-class applicants because an outdated policy has excluded them from loans and grants available to almost all other mature healthcare students. Since September, trainees must complete a university (BSc) degree to qualify as a paramedic. However, paramedic science, unlike other NHS professions, is ineligible for a student loan if studied as a pre-registration (second) degree course in England. Those wanting to join ambulance crews face £27,500 tuition fees. They are also barred from receiving a £5,000-a-year NHS maintenance bursary launched in 2020 to encourage healthcare recruitment. Most pre-registered students studying related subjects are eligible for the money, which is not means tested. Mature students in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland qualify for varying degrees of government support. The English funding anomaly means that a paramedic seeking to retrain as a nurse or a dentist can apply for a student loan and an NHS learning support grant, whereas a nurse or dentist who wants to retrain as a paramedic will have to fund fees and training expenses, as well as living costs, themselves. Emergency services representatives say the policy is a barrier to would-be paramedics on low incomes at a time when staff shortages have forced ambulance services to recruit from Australia. Last July, the NHS announced investment worth £55m in ambulance trusts to boost numbers before a winter that, in January, saw the highest level of emergency call outs ever recorded. The College of Paramedics says: “Given that students undertaking nursing, midwifery and other allied health profession courses as a second degree are eligible for funding, it is simply not fair or just to financially penalise those who want to study paramedic science.” Some students are unaware that they don’t qualify for the learning support fund when they start their training, because the exemption is not clear in NHS and government guidance. The NHS careers website, for example, promises that paramedic students will receive “annual payments of at least £5,000” without mentioning that mature students don’t qualify. First-year student Atiha Gupta is having to give up her accommodation and move in with her parents after discovering that she was not entitled to the bursary. The 33-year-old playwright decided to switch careers during the pandemic. “The prospect of a bursary, which was promoted as non-means tested, was the deciding factor because my income was very low,” she says. “When I applied, I was told I am not eligible because, with a degree in politics, I don’t qualify for a student loan. Paramedics are clinicians who go into unstable, dangerous environments. I feel we are not valued.” Critics claim the profession is being penalised by a government oversight. When funding for healthcare tuition was overhauled in 2017, an exemption to student finance rules allowed undergraduates studying healthcare as a second degree to apply for a government loan. Paramedicine was omitted because it had not yet been granted degree status. As a result it was not included in the new bursary scheme. The first paramedic degrees were launched in 2018 and are now mandatory for new recruits. The Department of Health and Social Care says it is keeping the decision under review and that the funding policy must balance the support of students with the need to deliver maximum value for money for taxpayers. “Paramedics have shown immense commitment during the pandemic, working tirelessly to look after us and our loved ones,’’ it says. “We’re committed to supporting and growing the NHS workforce.” Ruth Triggs, 25, graduated in criminology and forensics and worked as a 999 call handler for four years before deciding to retrain. “It’s such an intense course that I definitely would not have had the right frame of mind to do it straight out of school,” she says. “The system pushes us to make a decision about our whole career when we are so young, but I needed some more time to experience other workplaces and decide what career path I wanted to take.” She was unaware that she did not qualify for student financing or the NHS bursary until she had started her course. She is now having to move to a cheaper flat and juggles a part-time job on top of her course work and regular 12-hour placements on call-outs. Natalie Pavia enrolled as an undergraduate in paramedic science after she lost her job in the travel sector during the pandemic. The 39-year-old lives with her parents and doubts she will never own her own home because she’s had to use the deposit she had saved to fund her training and living expenses. “Not being eligible for student finance cuts me off from other incentives,” she said. “I cannot apply for travel expenses when I’m on placement like other students and don’t qualify for university bursaries for students who live at home.” Gupta fears that without the bursary she had counted on, she will have to drop out of a course she loves. “When I was 13 my brother died, and the sense of hope when the paramedics arrived has stayed with me. I desperately want to be part of the solution to the problem of staff shortages,” she says. “The NHS is celebrated with the now ubiquitous rainbows in windows but sadly without that promised pot of gold.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Would-be paramedics hit with £27,500 bill to retrain for vital service",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/13/would-be-paramedics-hit-with-27500-bill-to-retrain-for-vital-service

The challenge the Norwegian polymath set herself as she wrote the eight songs on her eighth album was for them to be about “just me”. Whether that’s what she has achieved is open to interpretation: these songs have autobiographical starting points, but Hval’s lyrics are so rich in allusion and so full of unpredictable twists and turns (American Coffee, for example, takes in Deleuze-quoting nurses and a UTI-tainted cinema trip) that it’s hard to know where reality ends and metaphysical pondering begins. Either way, “What is a home but the place you’ll be dying?” is a sentiment that’s unlikely to ever feature in estate agents’ brochures. That she uses language so strikingly should come as no surprise – Hval is also a published novelist. And a palette big on muted, unshowy electronica complements her words perfectly, providing a platform for her seraphic voice to glide across and giving these songs a dreamlike quality.

3/13/2022,"It’s a modern mystery why Charlotte Mendelson, one of the funniest writers in Britain, isn’t a bestseller (though she has just been longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction). Her new novel is so devoid of secondhand sentences that it’s quite possible she spent all nine years since its predecessor polishing her jokes and turning phrases round until they shine. The Exhibitionist is about artists: a popular subject for novelists, who get to write about the creative process in a slightly more glamorous field than their own. It has two focal points: one is Ray Hanrahan, an ageing painter who is a reminder that not every overlooked artist deserves a renaissance. Ray – obstreperous, self-involved (“Soon he’ll be in the bath with his accessories: the paper and a large bacon sandwich”) – is the physical centre of his ramshackle London house, where “what Ray insists are just very big mice have tunnelled into the compost bin”. Orbiting him on the weekend the novel is set – in February 2010 – are two daughters, a stepson and his wife, Lucia, the story’s emotional centre. Lucia is an artist too, aged 54 (“almost dead”), and has spent decades squashing down a talent and ambition of her own that Ray never noticed. Instead, “making him great was their joint project”, and only now that she’s older, “children launched”, is she beginning to notice the sparkling opportunities that keep trying to catch her eye. Thinking of herself doesn’t come easy to Lucia: life with Ray would be a full-time job even if she wasn’t feeling drained from cancer surgery. A master emotional manipulator (“What woman can resist a crying man? They’re so bad at it; it takes so much”), he even had an affair when she was recovering. “It’s horrible for you and me both. She used us,” he tells Lucia. Ray’s dark energy crackles mostly just out of vision: we get multiple angles of his character (someone asks Lucia if her cancer made her depressed: “Ray says I was horrible. So maybe”), but we never see inside his head, which I suppose would spoil the fun. He goes straight into the annals of bad dads, bad husbands and great comic creations. But as he prepares for his first showing of new work in decades – which comes off just as the reader hopes – Lucia is finding that all her pent-up energy has to go somewhere. She is about to achieve escape velocity, not just artistically but sexually, and it turns out that Mendelson is just as good at writing sexy as she is at writing funny. Throughout the book her gift is in succinct specificity of detail, which is perfectly deployed whether for comic atmosphere (“breathing cottage-pie steam from the Pensioners’ Club”), characterisation (“Hellie Brook was unsmiling, flat, tall”) or emotional ambivalence toward parenthood (“someone had to take care of them and she wanted to, sort of”). The result is a precision of observation that made me laugh frequently and smile when I wasn’t laughing. As the title suggests, The Exhibitionist is about what is and isn’t on display. Ray keeps nothing hidden – his former lover Sukie Blackstock even turns up at his show, “the first horsewoman of the Apocalypse” – while Lucia keeps everything to herself, until she can no longer. The book, too, keeps secrets, with many chapters ending on an unresolved cliffhanger or a rhetorical question. That might be one weak spot: the exquisite prose can cushion the emotions, and blot out the plot at least until the final stretch. But we don’t complain about this with other prose stylists, such as Saul Bellow or Martin Amis. “Is this,” wonders Lucia at the end of one chapter, “what it’s like to be a man?” The Exhibitionist by Charlotte Mendelson is published by Mantle (£16.99).

3/13/2022,"Last summer, the three-term New York governor Andrew Cuomo was considered, in political terms, dead and buried after one of the most spectacular falls from grace in modern US politics. A year earlier, he’d been an empathetic pandemic hero, offering New Yorkers a measure of confidence in the state’s response to the early waves of Covid-19 while the US president, Donald Trump, floundered or blustered his way through daily briefings as the terrifying death toll mounted. But then Cuomo was forced to resign from office, leaving wearing a cloak of scandals ranging from allegations of sexual harassment leveled by 11 women, including a member of his protection detail, to a cover-up of the number of elderly people who died in New York nursing homes from Covid-19. Yet now – at 64 and out of office – Cuomo is trying to flip the narrative again and claw back his reputation and maybe, just maybe, his political career. “I’m not disappearing,” he told New York magazine last year and he might just mean it. Over the past several weeks, Cuomo has accelerated a campaign of image correction that some believe is a prelude to efforts toward political rehabilitation. With $16m left over in his vacated governorship re-election campaign coffers, he’s got funds to finance the project. At a Brooklyn church last week Cuomo gave his first public speech since leaving office. In an event that looked and felt a lot like old-fashioned retail politicking, Cuomo took aim at those that had brought him down. “The actions against me were prosecutorial misconduct,” the Bible-quoting Cuomo said in the speech. “They used cancel culture to effectively overturn an election.” The speech came after the launch of a digital and television advertising campaign that is blaring the same message: Cuomo is the victim, unfairly driven from office. In America’s topsy-turvy politics, where chaos and division seem common currency on both sides of the political divide, even his critics are loth to count him out. “The country elected Donald Trump, so all bets are off,” said Sonia Ossorio, president of New York City’s National Organization for Women. “It’s the wild, wild west of politics right now across the country. In terms of personal redemption every human being is entitled to seek it. “News coverage focuses on politics as a sport,” Ossorio added “which diverts attention from what matters: keeping our government honest.” The question is, does anyone care besides Cuomo, and perhaps his brother Chris who was fired from CNN for his involvement in his elder sibling’s damage control efforts? “The effort you’re seeing is more focused on a public rehabilitation than pursuit of a specific political audience,” said Evan Nierman, a crisis management expert. “The likelihood that New Yorkers are going to jump back on the Cuomo train after it was derailed in such an explosive fashion is unlikely. “Andrew Cuomo is the kind of person who doesn’t like not being in control. He likes directing things, shaping policy and outcomes, not being on the receiving end of that. So he’s looking for opportunities to influence his own future and take back a measure of control.” Last month, his attorney, Rita Glavin, repeated proclamations of his innocence and challenged an independent report from the state attorney general’s office that concluded “the governor sexually harassed a number of state employees through unwelcome and unwanted touching, as well as by making numerous offensive and sexually suggestive comments.” The central theme of Cuomo’s argument is that the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who announced and later dropped out of a run for governor, was politically motivated. Glavin has said she plans to file a misconduct complaint about James to an attorney grievance committee and has claimed James’s office had “directed an utterly biased investigation”. Four district attorneys looked into bringing charges but declined to do so, each stating carefully that their decision was not based on the credibility of his accusers. A fifth, from the Manhattan district attorney’s office, dropped its inquiry. It’s a crack in the door that Cuomo may believe he can lever open by reinterpreting, with help of the campaign war chest, the conclusions of James’s investigation. The former governor has had conspicuous Manhattan meetings with the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and New York’s mayor, Eric Adams. Before the largely Black congregation in Brooklyn, Cuomo offered a defiant and angry interpretation of his situation. “God isn’t done with me yet,” he continued. “I am blessed, I have many options in life and I am open to all, but on the question if I am at peace, no I am not. But I don’t want to be at peace, and by the way I don’t think you should be at peace either.” His attorney has put it more simply, telling a radio interviewer that Cuomo is “not going to let this go, because he can’t”. But his efforts provoked a sharp response. “Instead of accepting responsibility, serial sexual harasser Andrew Cuomo continues to challenge the accounts of victims,” read a statement from a group of nine women’s rights and advocacy organizations, including Eleanor’s Legacy, Amplify Her and Women of Color for Progress. Members of the Sexual Harassment Working Group – an Albany-based group of state government employees who have experienced workplace sexual harassment or assault said Cuomo was “using taxpayer dollars to fund his victim-shaming campaign after multiple investigations exposed him for what he truly is: a serial sexual harasser who fostered a toxic, hostile work environment”. The response broadly tallies with public opinion polls. A Sienna College poll published last month found that 52% of Democrats said they believed he sexually harassed multiple women, and said they believed James by a margin of 2-to-1 when she concluded he was a serial sexual harasser. Eighty per cent said he’d made the right decision to resign. “New Yorkers are not ready to forgive and forget when it comes to Cuomo,” said Steven Greenberg, a Siena College pollster. But the former governor, who has also spent $1.8m on legal and public relations expenses that include resisting efforts by an ethics commission to claw back more than $5m he received for a book about his handling of the pandemic, remains set on rehabilitation. He told Bloomberg last month that he had not resigned because he did anything wrong – but because he didn’t want to be a distraction. “I’m still focused on communicating what happened here. Because as a precedent, it has to be exposed.” Nor would he rule out a future run for office. “He’s trying to find a way to remind people of what he thinks they should think about him,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic pollster and former political scientist. Cuomo, he said, was trying to find something that people can feel good about. Against him are voter tendencies against three-term governors and that the accusations against him are “the very things New Yorkers and Americans have problems with”. “He’s got to find a way to explain who he was as governor and make it believable before people will give him the opportunity,” Sheinkopf says. “This is not a guy who dies easily but he’s pretty close to moribund right now.”",News/US news,Andrew Cuomo resigned amid a wave of scandals.

3/13/2022,"Britain’s mothers are whacked because they are trying to be perfect. So says a survey published last week, one that has prompted me to start a new club. It will be called something along the lines of the Supermums’ Survivors Club. Members will, like me, have tried to be exemplary mothers – combining work and home, our careers and our children – but crashed and lived to tell the tale. We seemed to be thriving: one minute suited and blow-dried, at our desks; the next holding a clean-bottomed baby, surrounded by blond moppets in a perfectly tidy house. A perfect vision of juggling and having it all. Except none of it was true. We were worn out and worn down. Bone-weary and tearful. And in the end, it was all too much. In my case, the pressure of trying to keep all the balls in the air led to two severe depressive episodes when I was in my 30s. I was worried about trying to work (at that time I was a newspaper reporter), trying to be a good mother and trying to be a good wife – in fact, trying to be a supermum. I became more and more overwhelmed with worries. I was bursting with an active dread that disaster was about to strike. Something terrible was going to happen and I couldn’t do anything to stop it. It felt like I was on a plane that was going to crash. In three days, I went from being mildly anxious to being unable to move, in an agonising foetal curl on the floor, suicidal with fear. It proved to be the start of my first major depressive episode, born of feeling overwhelmed. Another one followed a few years later. Given my experience, I wasn’t surprised by Bupa UK’s survey that found that 63% of women are exhausted by trying to be perfect mothers. We aspire to perfect-parent status: parents who cook, entertain, oversee extracurricular activities and whose children get top grades. We obsess about having everything all figured out. We are always optimising to control, improve and streamline our lives, our children and our bodies. To make every second, calorie and career opportunity count. And one-fifth of mothers say the pressure to be a supermum has affected their mental health. Almost one-third of them have sought help from a medical professional for mental health concerns but kept it a secret from their loved ones. Stigma, it seems, is alive and well. If anything, being a mother is even more pressurised now than when I was raising my own children, the youngest of whom is now 18. Half of the mothers in the survey said influencers on social media, celebrity posts and posts from other mothers made them feel they had to live up to unrealistic standards. The mythical perfect mother is flourishing on Instagram. Social media chips away at the feeling that we are fine, in insidious ways. We see other people who seem to be having more fun at family meals than our own dismal affairs, people who are better, richer, thinner and more glamorous parents than we are. Whereas once we might have compared ourselves to our neighbours or friends, now we can compare our family life to the world’s most successful and powerful people. Naturally, few of us feel we or our families match up. Clearly, this pressure to be a perfect mother is bad for us women: female perfectionism is one factor leading to higher rates of depression. Women are more likely to suffer from depression than men, according to the Mental Health Foundation. In 2014, one in six adults had a common mental health problem: about one in five women and one in eight men. From 2000 to 2014, rates of common mental health problems in England steadily increased in women and remained largely stable for men. My view is that trying to be perfect is also bad for our children. We are modelling to them the idea that they need to be superchildren. The more perfect we are, the more pressure we put on our children to be likewise. The reality is that there are many advantages of a less than ideal childhood and imperfect parenting for our children. Witnessing failure and messiness and muddle in imperfection in us parents can all be forces for good for our children, especially for our teenagers. Adolescents need challenges to grow and having perfect parents may not necessarily be part of that. Brief periods of normal stress are not harmful for children; they are essential, says Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and the co-author (with Greg Lukianoff) of The Coddling of the American Mind. Children need a wide range of experiences to become strong. If they are over-protected, we perfect parents may systematically be stunting their growth, Haidt argues, all with good intentions. A more relaxed answer, and one that may be better for both us and our children, is to aim for being good enough, an idea originally suggested by psychologists such as Donald Winnicott. He argued that no child needs an ideal parent. They just need an OK, decent, usually well-intentioned, sometimes grumpy but basically reasonable father or mother. It is a view shared by the clinical psychologist Dr Carla Croft, from Barts Health. She says: “Calmer parenting comes from accepting and being gentle about our imperfections. When we are not perfect, we are teaching our children about real relationships – you could say authentic love.” It is a message I hope a new generation of mothers will heed. That being good enough is the aim and that they don’t need to be supermums. One day, I hope, there will there be no takers for survivors’ clubs like mine.

3/13/2022,"“Thank you very much Ireland,” said Kate Kolva, waving a little blue and yellow flag in the arrivals hall at Dublin Airport. As she waited to collect her best friend’s mother, Ukrainians with no family connections with the country were all too easy to identify. All morning they arrived. Looking dazed as they streamed through the doors. Children clutching teddies, mothers, some elderly, pulling their world’s belongings in one or two bags. As they looked on, tears welled up behind the public barrier among those waiting to collect tourists and business passengers. “I cannot cry any more,” said Kolva. Next to her stood Angelo, waiting for his girlfriend, Natalya. She had made the gruelling 30-hour journey from Kyiv to Warsaw a week earlier but had been stymied by UK immigration rules. Her boyfriend described how she had been denied travel at the boarding gate because the plane was transiting through Stansted. “They did not allow me on the plane because they asked for a visa for the UK. I said ‘how can I get a visa? There is a war in my country’,” said Natalya, who had left a good job in Kyiv working for a media agency. She had no such problem getting into Ireland. “It was very easy. Someone just said, ‘who is from Ukraine?’ and they gathered up the group and took us to the plane.” Within minutes Kolva’s best friend’s mum, Olha Novikova, 69, arrived. Her eyes were swollen, her voice etched with anger and sadness. “She is happy to be safe, but she doesn’t want to be in Ireland. She wants to be back in Ukraine to help fight the Russians,” Kolva translated. These were just two of the 500 people a day seeking sanctuary in Ireland in the wake of the war. Within minutes of arrival, they are taken to a welcome building with food, drinks, phone chargers, toys and people buzzing around to help with registration for residency. During a week in which the UK and the Home Office were battered by sharp criticism for insisting that Ukrainians must apply for a visa before entering the UK, the contrast in Dublin could not have been starker. While one builder in Calais complained that British authorities had “treated us worse than the water in the toilet”, turned away after a 2,000-mile journey because they had no visa for the UK, Ireland lifted visa restrictions and extended the right to live and work for up to three years. As the numbers of arrivals ballooned in Ireland, the government decided the refugee crisis should be met with a humanitarian response with efforts to simplify all the paperwork needed. Crucially, it would be completed after arrival, not before. The Dublin Airport Authority decided to donate its headquarters and government departments dealing with housing, health, and immigration together set up a “one-stop shop” to ease the plight of refugees. “This is the first port of call for so many people who are arriving from Ukraine who have fled over the past number of days. What’s really important is that when they arrive first they get a very warm welcome,” said justice minister Helen McEntee. A bright and airy building, 500 metres from the arrivals hall, it was bustling with activity with toys, sim cards, cots, changing rooms and pallets of free food and soft drinks. Arrivals first sat down to complete the paperwork that will generate Ireland’s equivalent of a national insurance number and temporary residency protection. While immigration checks were completed, refugees were invited to wait upstairs in a newly created lounge complete with colourful cushions brought the day before from Ikea. Mothers could leave their children in a supervised soft play area next door or pick up toiletries and care packages from a series of rooms converted into free shops stacked with everything from toothpaste and tampons to shampoo and baby clothes. The airport authority had even brought down its collection of lost buggies.",News/World news,"Dublin welcomes dazed Ukrainian arrivals with food, buggies and toys",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/dublin-welcomes-dazed-ukrainian-arrivals-with-food-buggies-and-toys
3/13/2022,"The old adage is that if you’re not leftwing at 20 you have no heart, if you’re not conservative 30 years later you have no head. But from the treatment of refugees to the management of the economy, no one of any age can have a head and be conservative in 2022. For our times, conservatism is just plain wrong. As the country confronts the acute stagflation of the years ahead, it will look for very different economic leadership from the warmed-up Thatcherism that, it’s becoming clear, is chancellor Rishi Sunak’s core philosophy. Economic prospects in 2023 and 2024 were dire enough before the consequences of Putin’s murderous war. Now they are desperate. Russia is the world’s largest exporter of gas, oil and wheat and the second-largest exporter of sunflower oil. Ukraine is the world’s fifth-largest exporter of wheat and second-largest exporter of maize. The price of all these core commodities has spiralled upwards for obvious reasons, with the price of oil catching the headlines. Leading forecasters predict the price will surpass $200 (£153) a barrel this summer, a third higher than its record high of $147 barrel. Past oil and gas price hikes on this scale have unfailingly triggered global recessions and a rise in inflation. The added impetus of the astonishing hike in food prices makes both now certain. Before Putin’s war, the Bank of England expected consumer price inflation to peak this April at 7%; now, the general expectation is that inflation will peak at 9.5% in October and only fall back gradually thereafter. Over the next five years, it will average at least 5%. These will be the highest levels of inflation since the 1970s, the decade that incubated the rise of monetarism and the associated view that trade unions and big government were the source of economic evil. In his feeble Mais lecture last month, the chancellor tried to argue that big government remained the economic enemy and tax cuts offered the promise of a renewed enterprise culture. That was a contestable proposition in the 1970s. Today, it borders on genuine madness. Instead, we need a clear-eyed look at what confronts us. Inflation and fresh recessionary impulse will be overlaid on an economy that both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank of England reckoned was already heading for close to zero growth. Now, the likelihood is a high-inflation recession followed by stagflation for most of the 2020s. Everything that might propel growth is being squeezed: consumer spending by the cost of living, real government spending by inflation, investment by dark economic prospects and the relatively high cost of capital. You have to go back 50 years for every dial on the economic dashboard to flash red. There was little glamour about the dreary, high-inflation 1970s. It was a decade of defensiveness, defeat and retrenchment. What boomed on high streets were not coffee but charity shops. Some creativity and solidarities did stir in the grass roots – the 1970s witnessed the birth of a vibrant housing association movement, some good bands flourished and people looked to trade unions to protect them from the worst. But in the main the sense was of closure. There were scant openings for the young. Business startups were few and far between. Successive attempts at stemming a wage price spiral with pay limits, freezes and social contracts worked, at best, only partially. It was the decade social democracy died, the victim of a pincer movement between a Bennite left calling for utopian “true” socialism and a Thatcherite right insisting that utopia lay in the free market. The 2020s will see the proper eclipse of both. Thatcherism’s illogicalities and base errors were bailed out by a 40-year boom in credit and property, aided by EU membership that compensated for the lack of fit-for-purpose economic institutions and a sane economic strategy. Interest rates squeeze incomes and Brexit has put paid to credit, property and service sector booms. Instead, the prospect is for stagnating, even falling, property values – socially an imperative but an economic depressant. Equally, Benn- and Corbyn-style socialism is obviously neither operable nor sellable to the electorate. The only way forward is a revivified social democracy. Sunak may not have noticed, but Britain’s Jurassic Park economy, as international investors dub it, is shunned not because of high taxes, which are higher in Germany, Holland, Nordic countries, Austria and Belgium – which all have higher GDP per head and understand the importance of economic openness. We don’t have a viable growth model and suffer from a poverty of supportive economic institutions. Above all, we are dogged by politicians who believe Brexit is an opportunity and Thatcherism worked. Thus the proper response to high energy prices and Russia’s foreign policy influence is to accelerate independence from fossil fuels led not by big government but necessary government. It is not to double down on fossil fuel reliance, issuing new licences to drill in the North Sea and relaxing rules on fracking. Energy policy requires strategies that work over a generation, not a response to today’s spot prices. Solar and wind power are now even more economically attractive, but so is electricity generated from power stations in space and microwaved back to Earth. Britain’s Space Energy Initiative plans a power station 36,000km high, but why not more? Lift Britain’s tax take to the middle of the IMF’s league table and we could have nil dependence on fossil fuels by 2035. It’s the same elsewhere. There is a £2.5tn opportunity to boost the economy over 20 years in properly executed levelling up. Upgrading non-graduate skills carries another hefty price tag. Equally, a range of institutions – public development banks, growth accelerators, a scaled-up, well-resourced Catapult network – need to stand behind enterprise. And the whole economy requires unfettered access to the EU’s single market. All of this is possible. As I’ve argued before, issue 50-, 75-, 100-year bonds to pay for the programme, as we have in wartime – which will now involve sustained defence spending. Mitigate the worst of the cost-of-living crisis with generous rebates on energy bills and targeted income support. Sunakian babble about instilling a culture of enterprise while hoarding public spending today to finance pre-election tax cuts is both wrong and a national betrayal. What is needed is a social democratic mindset – and action today.  Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Warmed-up Thatcherism was never going to be the answer.

3/13/2022,"When Marlee Matlin won the Oscar for best actress in 1987 for her performance in Children of a Lesser God, it was a landmark moment for deaf people. But it would be another 35 years before Troy Kotsur became only the second deaf person to be nominated for the honour, for his groundbreaking turn in Coda. And on Sunday he hopes to become the first deaf actor to win a Bafta in one of the main categories. “You had not seen a deaf [Oscar] nominee before Marlee so when she won I was thrilled – I thought we had a breakthrough as deaf actors,” said Kotsur, 53. “And so, 35 years later, I’m realising that deaf actors still really struggle to break in.” Coda (an acronym for child of deaf adults) is about a deaf fishing family in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and their hearing teenage daughter’s passion for singing. Featuring deaf actors in key roles – including Matlin, who plays the wife of Kotsur’s character – and with much of the dialogue in American Sign Language (ASL), the film is being viewed as a groundbreaking moment for Hollywood and for onscreen representation. The film – which has already won the top prize at Sundance last year, two Screen Actors Guild awards and is nominated for three Baftas and three Oscars - was adapted by writer-director Sian Heder from the French film La Famille Bélier. But, unlike that 2014 movie, which was criticised for using hearing actors to play deaf people, Coda casts deaf actors in deaf roles. It was reportedly bought by Apple at Sundance for a record $25m. For Kotsur, after more than 20 years in the industry performing in films, on television and on Broadway, this moment has been a long time in the making. At times he worked multiple jobs and sometimes slept in his car or in theatres. “My question was: how soon will Hollywood accept me and how can I keep my hope alive?” he said. Part of what kept him going was the success of Matlin, who he describes as his hero. “I call it a really, really hellish long tough journey, and it was, but now here I am,” said Kotsur, from Arizona. Now he hopes that together he and Matlin can “help Hollywood to have some empathy” by changing the way deaf people are seen and portrayed on screen. The film has had an incredible impact on deaf, hard-of-hearing and disabled people, he said: “Now they’re able to really see their identity, their experience being shown on screen.” Part of what attracted to him to the film was that it featured multiple deaf characters as opposed to one, which is often the case, and his character’s colourful use of language. “Frank Rossi was able to drop plenty of f-bombs in ASL. So it was a thrill for me to show that part of deaf culture on the big screen,” he said. “We’re so used to seeing all of your hearing movies with your swearing and subtitles, but where was our chance to show that part our language and culture?” There has, he said, been a cultural shift and in Hollywood, producers and celebrities are now getting in touch with him “rather than me approaching them begging for work”. Actor Javier Bardem told him that he “cried like a baby” watching the film, he said, and stars have spoken to him in sign language. “I see Hollywood beginning to be motivated to look for something new, something inspiring and avoid the same old tropes that’s not just ‘Oh, have pity for a deaf character’, but have them as the hero,” he said. In the future he would like to develop a story about deaf historical figures. He is currently reading several scripts and he is talking to producers about adapting hearing characters into deaf roles. “So we’ve been setting up meetings on how can this character communicate. How would a deaf character work in these particular situations? And they’re really showing me that a lot of these producers are beginning to open their minds.” As well as Kotsur’s nomination for best supporting actor, Coda is also nominated in two other Bafta categories: adapted screenplay for Heder and leading actress for Emilia Jones, who plays Kotsur’s daughter and will sing at Sunday’s ceremony in London at the Royal Albert Hall. Kotsur said during filming that the British actress reminded him of his own daughter, who is a coda and a similar age. “She’s been through a lot and sometimes it’s hard for her to connect with her hearing friends who don’t really understand what it is like to be raised by deaf parents,” he said. “But our film explains so much and my daughter feels seen and validated.” Heder, 44, whose first feature film, Tallulah, starred Elliot Page and Allison Janney, and has written and produced for the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black, said Coda very nearly did not get made. She originally pitched the adaptation to Lionsgate and was hired to do it by the studio. But through her research, she made firm decisions about how she wanted to tell the story. As well as hiring deaf actors, she wanted to have half the dialogue in ASL and use silence, and not fill scenes with music. But it was not a match at the studio and the project died. “It was heartbreaking on one hand and on the other hand it felt like that other version of the movie should not exist,” she said. But when Lionsgate boss Patrick Wachsberger left the studio, he took the film with him and bought it back made it independently with Heder – it was shot in 30 days – and with no distributor. “There has been so much fear among hearing people in Hollywood in terms of the process,” said Heder, who is from Massachusetts and lives in Los Angeles. Early on, when she was told she wanted to hire deaf actors, people kept asking her how it would work – a question that is not asked about many seemingly impossible feats in the film-making process. “If you say ‘I want to run this car off the bridge into the river and then I want this building to blow up in the background’, no one says: ‘Well you can’t do that – how would it work?’” Once everything was in place, the film-making process was “relatively easy”, she said: “So that is an argument that doesn’t hold water any more.” Deaf charities said the film and the recognition Kotsur has received highlight the importance of deaf people being portrayed on screen and that Kotsur could inspire a generation. Likethe deaf actor Rose Ayling-Ellis’s Strictly Come Dancing win, Coda can help transform public understanding of deaf people’s experiences, said Annie Harris, advocacy officer for the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. “Coda is a wonderful film and Troy has so evidently been nominated for a Bafta on the merits of his performance,” said Harris. “His nomination demonstrates to deaf people like me that some barriers are breaking down, and deaf people are getting the recognition they deserve in their chosen field.” Martin McLean, senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children’s Society said that for many young deaf people Coda could be the first time they have seen “their reality given the true Hollywood experience”. He added: “We’re finally starting to see more and more deaf characters and it’s important that we build on this momentum.”",Arts/Film,‘It’s been a hellish long journey’: deaf actor Troy Kotsur hopes to scoop top Bafta,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/13/its-been-a-hellish-long-journey-deaf-actor-who-hopes-to-scoop-top-bafta
3/13/2022,"My husband sweeps in, catching me listlessly watching a video of hippos eating pumpkins, one hand clawed around my mouse, the other holding my slab of Desk Chocolate, a snack category I have recently introduced to my home office. Earlier I was putting it back in its packaging between bites, but this pretence ceased hours ago. I am busy, but achieving nothing, because I am distracted by the things I am not doing, the things I have failed to do previously, and those I will fail to do next. Also because of the hippos. My husband, by contrast, is wholly in the moment. He exudes energy, purpose and other alien-to-me concepts. His arrival causes our ancient dog, which has finally stopped moaning about the general state of its life, to jump as if electrified, then start moaning again. “You’re upsetting him,” I say sourly. “You know my new watch monitors my blood pressure and cardiac function? Well, apparently I’m in the top 10% of my age group.” “Jesus. Does that mean you’re never going to die?” “Well, not of a heart attack anyway.” “Marry a man five years older, you’re hoping for a few years’ peace, honestly.” “Lot of dementia in my family, too. Imagine, I’ll be completely gaga and still able to run really fast.” Then we laugh, with a manic edge. With our younger son about to turn 18, soon it will be just the two of us for ever. Of course, it’s debatable how empty any nest remains in these times of criminally unaffordable housing and education, but ours will definitely be emptier. Casting around for what our life looked like 20 years ago, BC, I can only conjure fragments. Some are reassuring – we already watched lots of TV, I recall – others less so. We fought more: I remember sleeping in the bath to prove a (ridiculous) point, and shouting at each other in various holiday beauty spots. You can’t really let rip with other people in the house, and an atmosphere is horrible, so the walk fight, the hissed fight, the snatched, shortcut fight, replaced real humdingers. I don’t want them back. Would we swipe right now? His current interests are freediving, climbing, monitoring household CO2 levels and humane rat traps. Mine are sitting still, fancy bantams and choosing what to eat from the online menus of restaurants I don’t plan to visit. But – at the risk of reviving the ancient curse of Hello! magazine – I’m excited. He’s suggested we go dancing (me: “Ugh”); I jokingly suggested we spend a month in Venice (him: “Yes! Book now, what are you waiting for?” – an excellent illustration of why I need him in my life). So far, we’ve only managed a few walks and a trip to look at rat traps, but there’s plenty of time, what with his superior cardiac function and the antioxidant properties of all my Desk Chocolate. These are interesting times to be in a long-term relationship, with stronger daylight being shone on this ordinary, mysterious state. Perhaps it’s because more of our long-term relationships have taken place in daylight hours, during successive lockdowns. “It’s like retirement,” friends messaged, darkly, in their snatched alone time in the bathroom or taking out the bins. I don’t think they meant the laughing, cruising, pastel-cashmere-slung-over-shoulders retirement of the targeted ads I get now. Whatever the reason, there are more unvarnished accounts of long-term relationships around. We can watch televised couples therapy; or read Lisa Taddeo writing in the New York Times about her husband’s inability to dispose of their dead Christmas tree. US author Heather Havrilesky has just published Foreverland: on the Divine Tedium of Marriage. “Do I hate my husband? Oh yes, for sure, definitely,” read part of an excerpt. It detonated ripples of shock, with readers telling her to get counselling or a divorce, angry she hadn’t done the decent thing and lightly fictionalised the nesting dolls of love and loathing, frustration and gratitude that make up a marriage. The pushback, Havrilesky said, is “A piece of our culture’s insistence that all stories of love remain firmly grounded in sugarcoated, airbrushed fantasies.” She’s right. We know the ever after isn’t a misty, idyllic fade out but, somehow people are still shocked to see it publicly, plainly told. That sometimes, long-term love is a confronting challenge: one of you gets ill, finds God or takes up golf. That sometimes a relationship can feel both irretrievably broken and rock solid within 24 hours; even an hour. That often, nothing particular happens, the ebb and flow of estrangement and rapprochement, the happy accident of never wanting to split at the same time. Wouldn’t it be good to make this a bigger part of the stories we tell about love and marriage? Entering a new phase of my own story, I’m hungry to hear the ones about bins, rashes and resentments. They lack that obvious narrative arc of new love, or the end of love, but, often, so does life. Especially if one of you turns out to be practically immortal.
