2/23/2022,"The Coalition has re-announced almost $20m for fracking company Empire Energy, a firm with links to the Liberal party, just two months after a court ruled a previous issue of the grants was invalid. The resources minister, Keith Pitt, announced on Wednesday that three grants worth $19.4m would be given to Empire Energy to incentivise exploratory drilling in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin, a region the Morrison government wants to open up as part of its gas-led recovery.  The decision has prompted anger among environmentalists and Indigenous groups, who have said fracking the Beetaloo Basin would drive up Australia’s emissions by 13%. “This is a carbon bomb of extraordinary proportions that will scupper any chance of meeting the Paris targets,” Environment Centre NT co-director Dr Kirsty Howey told the Guardian. “It’s completely unreasonable for the minister to be approving these grants.” Pitt’s announcement follows a federal court ruling in December that previous grants given to Empire worth $21m – almost half the available funding from the $50m Beetaloo Cooperative Drilling Program – were invalid. The court slammed the government for signing the final agreements while a legal challenge brought by the Environment Centre NT was under way, ruling the actions rendered the grants invalid. But the court dismissed the Environment Centre NT’s main argument that the minister should have considered the fracking plan’s impact on global heating before announcing the grants, leaving it open for the government to reissue the grants. During the case, lawyers for the Environment Centre presented modelling evidence that fracking in the Beetaloo Basin could drive up Australia’s emissions by 13%, using up the rest of Australia’s carbon budget under the Paris Agreement. The court’s decision paved the way for the money to be re-announced on Wednesday. Pitt said the government was “committed to a gas-led recovery” and opening up the Beetaloo. “These grants will assist in that important process,” he said. “Australian gas is in high demand domestically and internationally and it’s important that we work to get new gas production online.” A Senate inquiry has previously probed Empire Energy’s links to the Liberal party. The inquiry has heard Empire has donated to the NT’s Country Liberal party and flew a Liberal party fundraising chair to inspect its operations. Empire is chaired by Paul Espie, a frequent Liberal donor and director of the Menzies Research Centre, the inquiry has heard. The company told the inquiry the links played “no role whatsoever” in its applications for the grants and that it followed “due and proper process at all times”. Johnny Wilson, who chairs the Nurrdalinji Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, lives in Lightning Ridge, not far from Empire’s proposed wells. He said in a statement that the $19.4m would be far better spent on “essential services our communities need, like housing, education, health and roads”. “The government is doing the wrong thing backing fracking on our country, it is poisoning our water, our animals and upsetting the songlines that run across our land,” he said. Pitt said activists opposed to fracking in the region “threaten future energy security both here in Australia and in countries around the world that rely on our LNG exports”. “The Beetaloo sub-basin has the potential to be a world-class gas resource that could create thousands of jobs and bolster domestic and international gas supply,” he said. “The taxes and royalties that are generated from the resources sector allow state and federal governments to provide the health, education and other essential services all Australians rely on.” Pitt was the headline speaker at an Energy Club NT event on Tuesday evening, which cost almost $1,000 per table to attend. A positive Covid diagnosis forced him to give the speech remotely. Activists, including those from the Protect Country Alliance, rallied outside the event. Protect Country Alliance spokesperson Graeme Sawyer said the fracking plan would only benefit a “minuscule” number of people, saying the majority of the gas would be exported. “Ninety-nine point nine per cent of Territorians won’t benefit from this industry - instead we will suffer as fracking pollutes our rivers and groundwater, and drives dangerous climate change that is already leading to never before seen heat records in the Top End,” he said.",News/Australia news,Coalition announces new $19m Beetaloo Basin gas support after previous grants ruled invalid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/coalition-announces-new-19m-beetaloo-basin-gas-support-after-previous-grants-ruled-invalid
2/23/2022,"Standing before the studio audience the slim older man holds a microphone in front of his blue polo shirt, buttoned to the neck. Wang Qingming seems a little nervous as he faces his prospective date, a formidable looking woman with long black hair piled in a loose bun, her name tag obscured. “What bad habits do you have?” he asks.  “I’m hungry,” she replies to laughter. “But no mahjong, no smoking, no drinking.” Asked about her health the woman says her physical condition is good, “but I can’t get pregnant now”, again prompting laughs. He boasts he hasn’t taken medication in a year, she proudly retorts that for her it’s been two. For her turn, she grills him about chores and finances, securing the offer of an allowance, and eventually the two hold hands as they walk to the back of the stage. The scene is one of countless clips taken from China’s prolific TV dating shows, shared hundreds of thousands of times across social media and written about across the local press. But rather than the usual young and idealistic contestants looking for some sort of romance, those going viral are all in their 50s, 60s and 70s and know exactly what they’re after. The “aunts and uncles” are direct, frank, and authentic, challenging romantic idealism as well as social taboos about older people and sex. They prioritise practical matters like housing, wages, social security, pensions, bride dowries and health. There are more than 260 million people aged over 65 in China – about 18% of the population – and about 25% of them are single, widowed or divorced. The older age group is growing, as China struggles to fend off the demographic crisis of an ageing population brought about by decades of government control on family building. Dr Pan Wang, Senior Lecturer in Chinese/Asian studies at the University of New South Wales, said negative attitudes toward elderly people were omnipresent, often seeing them as inactive, limited in mobility, dependent and frail, underrepresented or excluded from media entirely. “The shows give elder people agency and provide them a voice to portray their own narratives and an opportunity to look for love and remarriage,” Wang said. A recurring theme in the clips are headstrong women. In one episode of The Choice of Love a group of women ruthlessly cut into the ego of a man in his 70s looking only for a young and beautiful girlfriend. Some women push back on suggestions they should take on a traditional caretaker role again, while others prioritise financial security, which Wang said reflected concern over the rising costs of living and the struggling social welfare system. “Aunts basically have no house, no labour insurance and no pension,” said one commenter on Weibo. “Therefore, the needs are similar: money, housing and betrothal gifts. But for men, it’s all about looking at the appearance of the woman first, and then negotiating the conditions … to cook at home, do the laundry, and do housework.” The shows are also normalising the discussion of intimacy among older generations for a young audience which, according to a 2018 survey, overwhelmingly and mistakenly believes their own parents don’t have sex. Shared clips show older women joking about their sexual abilities or the bragging of men, or elderly men frankly discussing the importance of finding a sexual partner. “To an extent, these shows debunk the stereotypes and prejudice around the older population, they show that they are active, socially engaging and romantic despite many were born and grew up in the Maoist era, when romantic love was rare and discouraged and dating hardly existed,” said Wang. “It’s also evident from the shows that some women in their 60s or above are actively engaged in this gender economy just as the young girls do – i.e. wearing heavy makeup, modern clothing and performing their sexual attractiveness on stage, they are no longer seen as just house wives who are supposed to stay in the domestic realm, doing household chores or taking care of their husbands.” The decisiveness among the older contestants has won young fans and got them thinking about their own relationship goals. “I think there is nothing wrong with it. Even young people may choose a more open way of getting along … the essence of human-to-human interaction is value exchange” said one. “Talk openly and honestly, get along with each other in a down-to-earth way, and you can go as far as you can. May all lovers in the world be together.”",News/World news,China’s dating shows for over-65s challenge taboos about older people and sex,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/chinas-dating-shows-for-over-65s-challenge-taboos-about-older-people-and-sex
2/23/2022,"Numerologists will be fascinated that Joe Biden began his Ukraine speech on Tuesday at 2.22pm on 22.2.22. The US president, however, was more concerned with his own calculation of the economic and political costs of overreacting – or underreacting – to Russia’s provocations. Biden thought he would be remembered as the pandemic president, but finds himself commanding the arsenal of democracy in what could become the biggest military assault in Europe since the second world war. The crisis escalated on Monday after Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, an apparent pretext for invasion.  “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbours?” Biden demanded in the east room. “This is a flagrant violation of international law, and it demands a firm response from the international community.” But the response he delivered did not go as far as some in Washington would have liked, receiving a cautious welcome from Democrats and failing to satisfy Republicans who accuse Biden of appeasement. It was a shot across Putin’s bows but also the work of an administration keeping some of its powder dry. Biden announced sanctions that target VEB (Russia’s state development bank) and the Russian military bank, as well as the country’s sovereign debt and five Russian elites and their families. On the last point, the elites “share the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well”, Biden said. These oligarchs, who live the high life in London and elsewhere, represent a potential Achilles’ heel for Putin. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator, told the Guardian last week: “I think he depends on having good relations with the big thieving oligarchs because if they all conspired to defeat him, he’d have to do a lot of oligarch killing and they’d see that coming. His whole world gets pretty well rocked hard. That’s his point of weakness: pressure on the oligarchs.” For now, Biden threatened tougher steps if Russia “continues its aggression” and warned: “We’ll continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates.” The logic here is that sanctions lose their potency as a deterrent if they are imposed too quickly: if somebody has been punished for something they haven’t yet done, they might as well do it anyway. But with the window for diplomacy rapidly closing, it may soon be too late for deterrence to mean anything. Washington’s response did not have as much bite as the European Union’s . It did not grab attention like Germany’s steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia – a lucrative deal long sought by Moscow. The US has not severed Russia from the Swift banking system, used to move money around the globe, nor has it imposed export controls, which would have cut Russian firms off from key high-tech equipment and software. Bob Menendez, a Democrat who is chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, told the MSNBC network that it is “a good first tranche of sanctions but cannot be the end of it”. Republicans, who have been less opportunistic than usual in dinging Biden over Ukraine – perhaps sensing that the issue does not animate their base – may now be running out of patience with his determination to avoid too much too soon. Kevin McCarthy and other Republican leaders in the House of Representatives issued a joint statement earlier on Tuesday that said: “Sadly, President Biden consistently chose appeasement and his tough talk on Russia was never followed by strong action. Lethal aid was slow-walked, anti-air and anti-ship capabilities were never directly provided, pre-invasion sanctions proportionate to the aggression Putin had already committed were never imposed, and sanctions on Nord Stream 2 were waived.” And Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, revived a Republican talking point about the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. He was quoted by Punchbowl News as saying: “I don’t believe Vladimir Putin would have a couple of hundred thousand troops on the border of Ukraine had we not precipitously withdrawn from Afghanistan last August, but that’s where we are. Looking for signs of weakness.” The Afghanistan debacle precipitated a decline in Biden’s approval rating from which he has not yet recovered. But he does appear to have learned lessons from that failure with a policy of radical transparency about intelligence, close coordination with allies and warnings to Americans that there will be no rescue operation in Ukraine. All this has enabled him to play the role of global statesman and seasoned foreign policy hand. It has offered an unexpected boost to Biden’s promise to reunify Nato after the doubts and disarray of the Donald Trump years. But he may yet take further hits domestically if the crises forced gas prices even higher. “Defending freedom will have costs for us as well, here at home,” Biden said. “We need to be honest about that.” Honesty, however, may not be enough to win over a distracted and divided electorate.",News/US news,Biden’s Russia sanctions: why holding back could be part of his strategy ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/joe-biden-russia-first-sanctions-ukraine-analysis
2/23/2022,"Dominic Perrottet has sought legal advice over the decision to close down Sydney’s train network in the early hours of Monday, while issuing a stinging rebuke to his transport minister, saying he “should have been advised” about the shutdown before it occurred. The New South Wales premier insisted he still had confidence in David Elliott despite asking him to “reflect” on comments made on Tuesday, when the minister revealed he had gone to bed before a decision to close the rail network, which prompted widespread headaches for commuters.  “The minister will reflect on that and realise that all ministers are available 24/7,” Perrottet said. “That’s my expectation as premier. “My expectation is that ministers are immensely connected to the operational matters that are occurring within their portfolios.” On Tuesday Elliott said he had not been called by senior bureaucrats when they decided to shut the metropolitan train networkbut added he would probably not have answered had attempts been made to contact him. The minister also confirmed he had gone to sleep despite having an “inkling” a major disruption was on the way. Labor later brandished a text message in parliament that appeared to show he was aware of the potential for widespread disruption. Perrottet said he and the minister “should have been advised” and would investigate the role played in the decision by the Transport for NSW secretary Rob Sharp, the minister and senior officials in the shutdown. “There’s a breakdown in process here,” he said. “The technical legal issues are complex and I need to continue to get advice. I’ve sought advice and I’m working through it.” He said he was confident the decision made to stop trains “was the right one” – which was his first concern – and he was now turning his attention to why proper processes were not followed.

Perrottet also confirmed he had not yet seen the risk assessment on which the decision to scrap services was made.",News/Australia news,‘Ministers are available 24/7’: NSW premier rebukes David Elliott over Sydney train shutdown,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/sydney-trains-shutdown-nsw-premier-dominic-perrottet-rebuke-transport-minister-david-elliott
2/23/2022,"Ukraine’s president has called up the country’s reservists after Russia began moving troops into the country’s east, and warned that Ukraine could face a battle for its very existence. Volodymyr Zelenskiy ruled out a general mobilisation in an evening address to the nation. But the decision to bring reservists back into active duty was a further sign that Ukraine was bracing for a possible military clash with its neighbour.  Vladimir Putin said that Russia will support the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future. For weeks Zelenskiy has urged calm, and a search for diplomatic solutions, even as western allies issued increasingly urgent warnings about Russian invasion plans. Now he has told his country it must “increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational situation”. He added: “We need to promptly replenish the Ukrainian army and other military formations.” Zelenskiy’s defiant speech came after the US said on Wednesday that the invasion it had forecast for weeks had finally begun. Zelenskiy said that Ukraine is a peaceful country, but its people would not stay quiet in the face of aggression. “If we remain silent today, we will disappear tomorrow. We have hard work ahead, every day, but we are read for it, with confidence in ourselves, our country and victory,” he said. Zelenskiy also said he had held a cross party meeting to propose a defence coalition government and announced the launch of an “economic patriotism” programme of tax breaks and other incentives to bolster a country battered by the threat of war. Ukraine is losing billions of dollars a month as Europe’s worst security crisis in decades has prompted many who are able to flee the capital, Kyiv, moving to other cities or out of the country entirely.

2/23/2022,"Some of the world’s greatest directors launched their careers with an idea, a few thousand pounds and some friends with spare time on their hands. Those same friends would often go on to make up the bulk of the audience. But Netflix is giving Britain’s next big thing a chance to show their debut feature to the single biggest viewership the world has ever amassed – and is giving them a seven-figure sum to make it.  An unknown director, producer or writer will be given £1.5m and a global launch on the streaming service, in an effort to discover a future generation of “bold, distinctive” UK storytellers. The scheme, to be announced on Wednesday, will allow the directors to make anything from crime thrillers and sci-fi to romance and comedy, driven by the principle that “daring” film-making can “drive commercial as well as critical success and can emerge from all backgrounds”. At least one project will be picked from six shortlisted film-makers, who will each have received £30,000 to develop their projects over a year, with intensive training from industry mentors. Netflix will accept applications from across the creative spectrum – theatre, TV, video gaming, online content, commercials, graphic novels, music promos and short films. The programme, titled Breakout, will be open to film-makers who have not yet made a feature but whose work has already attracted industry or public attention. One of the biggest challenges for any film-maker, particularly a first-time one, is raising money for their film. Hannah Perks, Netflix’s manager of UK films, said the £1.5m budget would allow them to focus on the creative side. “They’re not going to have to think about putting that financing together – and their film will be shown on Netflix globally. It’s every film-maker’s dream to have a global release.” Breakout will proactively encourage submissions from underrepresented groups to reflect the full range of voices in modern Britain. Perks singled out for praise productions such as His House, an acclaimed horror film about the plight of Sudanese refugees in a spooky council house, a debut feature by the British writer-director Remi Weekes, who had previously made shorts and commercials. She said: “Although it’s about new talent, it’s about people who are film creatives, but who might also have worked in advertising, music videos or photography, and who haven’t had a chance to make a feature film but who have ideas. It’s about giving them a really healthy budget to make something that can be on Netflix and hopefully kickstart their career as film-makers – especially British film-makers, making commercial films our audiences love. “We haven’t got as many British films as we’d like on the service. That’s a key reason why we’re doing this. We want to get more British film-makers, up-and-coming film-makers.” The programme is a collaboration with Creative UK, which supports the creative industries. Paul Ashton, its head of film and television, said: “Talent is everywhere but opportunity is not, and from our very first conversation it was clear that Netflix shared our desire to offer career-changing opportunities to film talent in the UK.” Netflix, which is streaming in more than 30 languages and 190 countries, is the UK’s the most popular streaming service, with an estimated 14 million subscribers at the end of last year. Last September it announced it would provide training opportunities on its UK-based productions, including Sex Education, The Witcher and Top Boy.",Arts/Film,Netflix offers £1.5m budget in search for new UK film-makers,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/23/netflix-breakout-search-for-new-uk-film-makers
2/23/2022,"Fraud and error are likely to have cost the UK government as much as £16bn across the Covid-19 emergency loan schemes, according to parliament’s spending watchdog, which described the losses as “unacceptable”. A report from the public accounts committee published on Wednesday said the Treasury should by the end of the year come up with estimates of fraud and error losses across the individual schemes and how much it intends to recover.  The government guaranteed or gave out loans worth £129bn to people and companies during the coronavirus pandemic to support them financially through lockdown restrictions. However, ministers were warned from the start that the speed of the schemes would open them up to fraud. Since then government agencies have found large-scale frauds across several parts of the system, ranging from the coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS) for furloughed workers, the bounce back loan scheme (BBLS) for small companies, and the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) for mid-sized businesses. Reports from crime and bankruptcy agencies have shown some loans were used to fund gambling, luxuries and home improvements. Theodore Agnew dramatically quit his role as a Treasury minister in a speech in the House of Lords last month after criticising the lack of action to recover stolen money. Data from government departments’ annual reports suggested fraud and error losses of between £12.4bn and £20.1bn, with a central estimate of £15.7bn, the report said. The furlough scheme is estimated to have suffered the largest fraud and error losses of £5.3bn, followed by the BBLS where £4.9bn is thought to have been lost. The government has funded a “taxpayer protection taskforce” to chase fraud in the schemes including furlough run by HM Revenue and Customs, but anti-corruption experts are concerned that funding is inadequate to fight fraud in bounce back loans. The government will also have to write off £21bn in loans to people or businesses who will be unable to pay them back. Dame Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, said the loans fraud was part of a pattern of repeated failings by the government. “Lack of preparedness and planning, combined with weaknesses in existing systems across government, have led to an unacceptable level of mistakes, waste, loss and openings for fraudsters which will all end up robbing current and future taxpayers of billions of pounds,” she said. Hillier added that the Treasury should continue to account specifically for Covid-19-related spending measures throughout their lives, rather than allowing the spending to be absorbed into individual budgets. All of the UK’s Covid-19 responses are expected to cost £370bn over as long as 20 years in the case of the cultural recovery fund, according to National Audit Office data. Some £260bn had been spent by September 2021. “Government must be held accountable in this way to all the future taxpayers who will be paying for this response,” Hillier said. “Crucially this must ensure lessons are learned for when the next big crisis hits – be it climate, health or financial.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “We reject the claims made in this report. No fraudulent payments have been written off and the taxpayer protection taskforce is expected to recover up to £1bn from fraudulent or incorrect payments. “Thanks to the speed and scale of our intervention, the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels and growing at the fastest rate in the G7. The cost of inaction could have had a catastrophic impact on jobs and livelihoods.”",News/World news,UK lost up to £16bn due to fraud and error in Covid loans schemes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/uk-lost-up-to-16bn-due-to-and-error-in-covid-loans-schemes
2/23/2022,"Primary school-aged children produce about four times fewer aerosol particles when breathing, speaking or singing compared with adults, which could help explain why they seem to be at lower risk of spreading Covid. Various studies have suggested that young children are about half as susceptible to catching Covid as adults, and, despite carrying a similar amount of virus in their noses and throats, appear to pass it to fewer people if they do become infected.  One possibility is that the size and shape of their lungs and respiratory tracts means they emit fewer tiny airborne droplets called aerosols as they breathe and speak. These particles can linger in the air, particularly in enclosed space such as classrooms, so fewer aerosols could mean other people are less likely to be infected if they also occupy those spaces. To investigate, Dr Mario Fleischer at Charité University Medicine Berlin, and colleagues recruited 16 healthy children aged eight to 10 and used a laser particle counter to measure how many aerosol-sized particles they emitted when breathing at rest, and during speaking, singing and shouting. The results, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, suggested that shouting produced the most particles, followed by singing, speaking and then breathing. However, particle emission rates and volumes for singing, speaking and breathing were around four times lower for children, compared with measurements taken from 15 adults. “More precisely, children emitted [particle rates and emissions] during speaking of the same order of magnitude as adults breathing, and while singing, they emitted similar [particle rates and volumes] to the adults while speaking,” Fleischer said. The amount of aerosols produced during shouting was more similar between adults and children, however. The authors also cautioned that there was considerable variation between individuals, and their results didn’t suggest attending schools or after-school clubs was without risk. “Especially in constellations with high vocal loudness, which are common in the everyday life of children and adolescents, the aerosol emission could be similar for different age groups, as the measurements for the shouting condition show,” said Fleischer. “On the other hand, singing and talking at volumes typical for children might be less restricted if the time frame is limited, like in common school and extracurricular settings.” He added that other factors, such as the number of children and the design of indoor ventilation, also mattered, and that further research was needed to inform any recommendations made to schools.",News/World news,"Children ‘breathe out fewer aerosols’, which may reduce Covid risk – study",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/children-breathe-out-fewer-aerosols-which-may-reduce-covid-risk-study
2/23/2022,"Thomas Tuchel says Romelu Lukaku was dropped from Chelsea’s 2-0 win against Lille in order to take him out of the firing line after a torrid afternoon at Crystal Palace in which he touched the ball only seven times. The club-record signing spent the entire evening on the bench as a lively Chelsea attack, spearheaded by the excellent Kai Havertz, helped Tuchel’s side to put one foot in the Champions League quarter-finals.  Lukaku was widely derided for his performance at Selhurst Park on Saturday and his head coach explained it was time for him to take a “step back” from the starting lineup. “[It was] not the moment, after the match where everybody was focused on the few touches he had, to put him right away into the next fire,” Tuchel said. “It was the moment to take a step back. That was the decision and you can clearly see we had a strong win. Almost every question is about Romelu. The focus is huge. There are nine other players that didn’t play and we should never forget it is a team sport.” Tuchel went on to say Lukaku, who he had explained was “a little exhausted” before the match, was not ready to play with the intensity required. “The focus today was on intensity, a high-speed game and also hard work on the ball and, off the ball, to have intense teamwork. Romelu struggled in the last games to deliver that. That’s what I meant when I said he was tired: not only physically tired but mentally tired.” Havertz opened the scoring with his seventh goal of the season, Christian Pulisic adding the second, and Tuchel said the forward had shown “immense” work rate. He did not know why Lukaku, who was not among the four used substitutes, did not warm down with his teammates after the game and said it was a matter for his fitness staff. Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech both departed during the second half with injuries and are doubts for the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday. Tuchel said he regretted not replacing Kovacic at half-time.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel defends ‘mentally tired’ Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/thomas-tuchel-defends-mentally-tired-chelsea-striker-romelu-lukaku
2/23/2022,"Stamford Bridge was a crisp, clear, boisterous place at kick-off in this last-16 first leg, the air crackling with a comforting midweek energy under those low white lights. And for the next 90 minutes two things happened. First up there was that unavoidable sense of wider turmoil. What a strange, fraught occasion this was for the world’s most guilelessly weaponised sport, another turn as the hot dog seller in the background of history, a bumbling tourist on the front line of world events.  At lunchtime Roman Abramovich’s name had been bandied about the houses of parliament, the British prime minister insisting (incorrectly, it was later withdrawn) that sanctions were already in operation against Chelsea’s owner. By late evening this had been translated through the lens of midweek football into a meeting of English and French champions in the Gazprom-sponsored Uefa Champions League, with an unavoidable sense of interlocking fingers entwined around this occasion. In the middle of which, as ever, a game of football broke out. Geopolitical tensions may come and go. But we will always have neat, tactically astute Chelsea Champions League knockout victories. And from a certain angle this was almost a parody of the form: clean sheet, set-piece goal, N’Golo Kanté breakaway, good hustle, nice patterns, Thomas Tuchel on his feet having an ongoing, deeply personal argument with his disobedient invisible twin. Chelsea were excellent in many ways, a team working in sync and offering by the end the clearest demonstration – in his absence – of what exactly is eating Romelu Lukaku. Tuchel lined up his team with seven essentially defensive outfield players here and a Pulisic-Ziyech-Havertz front three that did not so much scream goals as whisper it very quietly through the sleeve of a heavy woollen jumper. By 79 minutes he had used four subs, none of whom was Lukaku. Timo Werner was out there, wheeling around like a runaway shopping trolley. But Werner also works like a mad thing in deep areas. It took him eight minutes to make it to seven touches. Tuchel said after the game that he left Lukaku out because he was tired. What was most notable was how utterly out of kilter with the rest of this team he looks these days. Here Christian Pulisic and Kai Havertz worked like Trojans in attack, running not just the channels but every channel, shuttling up and down the pitch utterly in tune with the collective effort. It was Havertz who made the difference early on, when he seemed to have a kind of invisibility cloak, penetrating the sovereign borders of the Lille six-yard box three times in quick succession. The last of these saw him force the corner from which he opened the scoring on eight minutes with a nicely timed run and a header. It is easy to forget how young he still is. In outline he has every attribute, from that compelling rangy stride, a footballer who looks as though he has strayed on to the pitch from some passing student charity half marathon, to the relentless ghosting movement. With 67 minutes gone he was back by his own corner flag, blocking off a forward run, hustling a Lille throw-in, doing deep, tactical, textural things. He is perfect for Tuchel, too. Chelsea’s manager wants control above all. Here he leapt up repeatedly, skinny ankles pounding the touchline, arms describing unknowable geometric shapes in the air. The thing that gets him most is failed turnovers, an inability to bite in at the right moment. And it was from there that the second goal came, made by the master of the creative turnover, and the game’s best player on the night. Kanté took the ball in the centre circle, saw a sliver of green and surged away, still so wonderfully light across the turf, then played the perfect pass at the perfect pace to Pulisic. His finish was expertly taken, garland to a fine, energetic performance. And that was pretty much that. There was time for Tuchel to have another tantrum on the touchline, hands thrashing at the air like a man being menaced by a swarm of crows. At that precise moment Chelsea were funnelling the ball about at the back, the game at a standstill. But Tuchel had seen lines, shadows, peril, misaligned objects. This is the level of precision he demands, the level of control freakery. Tuchel might have feigned mild surprise at those seven Lukaku touches against Crystal Palace but he sees all this stuff, just as he must also see his own inability to change that script, or to wring any more from this £90m asset. Leaving Lukaku out here was abrupt and to the point.

2/23/2022,"Countries should clamp down on the “aggressive” and “unethical” marketing of formula milk for babies, including forcing companies to sell products in plain packaging, a report by the World Health Organization and Unicef has said. In research, commissioned 41 years after the global health community drew up guidelines aimed at regulating the industry, experts found that the marketing of formula had “no limits” and had become more “unregulated and invasive” in the digital age.  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said it was clear the marketing was “unacceptably pervasive, misleading and aggressive”. He said: “Regulations on exploitative marketing must be urgently adopted and enforced to protect children’s health.” One measure the report suggests that governments explore is the standardised, plain packaging of formula products, a controversial proposal that will draw comparisons with tobacco marketing regulations in place in the UK since 2017. Dr Nigel Rollins, a paediatrician in the WHO’s department of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, said that while nobody was equating formula milk with cigarettes, the way both products were marketed were “not dissimilar”. “The commonalities are there,” he said. “But instead of packaging being an opportunity for commercial marketing, it should be a place where public health can actually give accurate information to women. And if that type of information can be given clearly and honestly, then I think that’s a good thing.” In the report, Tedros and Henrietta Fore, Unicef’s executive director until last month, said that while formula milk “has its place for women and parents who are not able or do not want to breastfeed”, babies’ best possible source of nutrition was their mother’s milk. The message carries particular weight in developing countries where parents often do not have easy access to clean water or sufficient supplies of formula powder, which public health bodies say can result in milk that is potentially harmful and can lead to diarrhoea and malnutrition. The long-term benefits of breastfeeding, to both mother and child, applied “across the board”, said Rollins. The WHO advises that babies everywhere be exclusively breastfed for the first six months and are given breastmilk alongside solid food until they are two years old. The new research – which comes 41 years after a set of non-binding regulations known as the international code of marketing of breastmilk substitutes was passed by the World Health Assembly – surveyed 8,500 parents and pregnant women and 300 health workers in eight countries, including Britain, China, Nigeria and Bangladesh. It found that the $55bn (£40.5bn) formula-milk industry was sending “misleading, scientifically unsubstantiated” messages, many of which violated the 1981 code. Large numbers of health workers internationally had been approached by the industry to influence their recommendations to new mothers through promotional gifts, free samples, funding for research, paid meetings, events and conferences, and even commissions from sales, the research found. Formula-milk manufacturers often carried out “exploitative” practices known as “pain-point marketing”, which purport to present solutions to common infant problems, such as colic, reflux and broken sleep, it added. The collective effect of this marketing was that parents were making crucial choices based on wrong information, Rollins said. “Decisions on something as fundamental and as influential as infant feeding should be primarily based on the most accurate and truthful information and not information that is somehow linked with commercial interests and commercial gain,” he added. The report makes no formal WHO recommendations, but suggests how countries could act, from tougher legislation on the promotion of formula to greater investment in programmes to support breastfeeding, including paid parental-leave policies. It calls for governments to look at the possibility of banning health workers from accepting sponsorship from formula-milk companies, and forcing products to be sold in plain packaging. “Exploring the area of plain packaging is definitely an area that we’re looking [at] because it was an area brought up by the mothers [surveyed],” said Rollins. “Mothers said they found the packaging confusing, not clear, and they were left uncertain what to do, or what to choose, because of the messages on the package.” The idea of formula in plain packaging was mooted in the UK in a 2017 private member’s bill put forward by the Scottish National party MP Alison Thewliss, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on infant feeding. At the time, Vicky Fallon, now a lecturer in psychology at Liverpool University, wrote that while a marketing clampdown was welcome, this move made her feel “conflicted”. “The message this conveys to mothers is really concerning – that in terms of health risks, formula is somehow on a par with tobacco or more risky per se than alcohol or other products known to negatively impact health. “To enforce plain packaging on a product which is not inherently harmful is neither justifiable nor proportionate,” she wrote.",News/Global development,"‘Aggressive’ marketing of formula milk flouts code, warns WHO as it urges curbs ",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/aggressive-marketing-formula-milk-flouts-code-warns-who-tobacco-plain-packaging
2/23/2022,"Australia is spending billions to build thousands of kilometres of new gas pipelines that may end up worthless stranded assets as the world moves to deal with climate change. The warning comes in a new report by Global Energy Monitor tracking 600km of pipelines currently under construction and 12,200km of proposed new infrastructure across Australia, with the total value of this work amounting to $25.8bn (USD$18.6bn).  According to the report, these projects include “substantial capacity expansions planned along the existing national network”, which “highlights the Australian government’s unbridled enthusiasm” for the gas industry despite the risk of creating stranded assets. Should they all go ahead, these pipelines would lock in decades of new production in several basins on the east coast including Beetaloo and Narrabri, and the Scarborough gas field in the north-west, by connecting them to export terminals. While the projects tracked in the report are consistent with what appears in the 2021 National Gas Plan, it also includes the west-east pipeline proposed by former Dow Chemical Global chairman Andrew Liveris. Liveris, the deputy chair of oil and gas engineering consultancy Worley and director of the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, revived the idea of a $6bn trans-continental pipeline in 2020 as an architect of the Australian government’s gas-fired recovery in response to the global pandemic. The proposal – first suggested in the mid-1970s – has long been considered unviable for a range of reasons and the most recent iteration has faced opposition even from within the fossil fuel sector. Australia’s building boom comes amid $485.8bn in pipeline construction activity globally – made up of 408 new pipelines, 70,900km of which are currently under construction and an additional 122,500km planned – despite a global push to divest from new fossil fuel investment. “The world is at an inflection point, where it can hasten the transition to renewables or further entrench itself in fossil fuels,” the report says. “It is choosing the latter.” The burning of fossil fuels such as gas is a key driver of global heating. Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021. Dan Gocher, Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility’s director of climate and the environment, said the scale of construction in Australia showed the “toxic level of influence” fossil fuel companies had on government. “We don’t need the gas,” Gocher said. “Gas demand on the east coast is forecast to flatline or decline. And once state governments get serious about addressing domestic gas demand that demand will really start to decrease. “It’s a massive stranded asset risk either for the taxpayers that build them or the companies that operate them.” Tim Buckley, energy transition analyst and director of Clean Energy Finance, said despite “platitudes to decarbonisation” companies were not taking divestment risk seriously. But he said that would change over the next few years as governments and regulatory authorities begin to crack down on “greenwash” and large investors grow serious about pulling their money out of fossil fuel production. “You can’t keep investing half a billion bucks in gas pipelines and think that in anyway that aligns with the Paris targets,” Buckley said. “When you build a gas pipeline you build it for 50 years, we’ve got a climate emergency which we need to act on in eight years. How can you build an asset like that when you have to change by 2050?” Global Energy Monitor is a San Francisco based energy monitor that tracks new fossil fuel developments and advocates for a transition to clean energy. It also publishes the Global Coal Plant Tracker, which follows investment in new coal power plants worldwide.",News/Australia news,Australia spending billions on new gas pipelines that may end up worthless stranded assets,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/australia-spending-billions-on-new-gas-pipelines-that-may-end-up-worthless-stranded-assets
2/23/2022,"The motto of Black-owned New York fashion brand Telfar is “It’s not for you – it’s for everybody”. If this has been hailed as a win for inclusivity, the epic show at New York fashion week was about defining what that meant for designer Telfar Clemens and his collaborators. A press release, handed out to guests, asked “how can a Black business with almost entirely Black customers - be the result of someone else’s inclusivity?” The exploration of what inclusivity means to Clemens and collaborators was an assault on the senses.  It began with a film from Telfar TV – the channel set up by the brand earlier this year. With the raw but fun feel of late night TV, presenters included designer Telfar Clemens and singer Ian Isiah, with different fans of the brand calling in, spontaneous prayers and sleepcams. This was followed by a more conventional fashion show, with a diverse cast and live experimental jazz collective, Solange collaborators Standing On The Corner Art Ensemble. The models wore an extremely covetable collection of sportswear-influenced clothes – the inspiration for which began with Clemens’ work for the Liberian Olympic team last year (he is Liberian-American). Here there were longline basketball shirts to baseball tops and ski suits. A pair of tracksuit trousers with cut-outs on the model’s legs managed to give a new spin to this extremely familiar item. The Telfar T logo found on its sell-out bags was transposed to the top of knee-high boots set to be equally in demand next season. After a further screening from Telfar TV, a second part of the collection was debuted – with oversized denim, long skirts and more baseball shirts. It culminated with all the models, Clemens and collaborators flooding the stage. “Wow,” said Clemens over a microphone. Any guest watching the hour-long visual spectacle would have to agree. Telfar was founded in 2005 by Clemens and his business partner Babak Radboy. Initially popular within the club scene they were part of, the brand hit the radar of the wider fashion industry with the vegan leather shopping bags they are now known for. First on the catwalk in 2014, the bags – which were based on the dimensions of a Bloomingdale’s bag – have become a runway success. Sometimes called the “Bushwick Birkin” thanks to its popularity in the fashionable Brooklyn area, the bags have now been worn by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Oprah and Solange, and won Telfar the Fashion Design of 2020 award from the Design Museum. The bag was a pandemic success story. Lyst named Telfar’s medium shopping bag the “hottest product” in the third quarter. Searches for the brand rose 61% while demand for its totes increased 270%.",Lifestyle/Fashion,New York Fashion Week: inclusivity centre stage at raw and diverse Telfar Clemens show ,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/23/new-york-fashion-week-inclusivity-centre-stage-at-raw-and-diverse-telfar-clemens-show
2/23/2022,"Fred believes Manchester United being led by an interim manager in Ralf Rangnick is causing uncertainty that is “a little bit bad” for the team. Although Rangnick has lost only one league game since his arrival, Fred claimed United are unstable as a result of the temporary nature of his role. “It’s a bit strange,” the midfielder told TNT Sports Brazil.  “I know in football it’s important to get good results as soon as possible but it’s also important to have a long-term plan. I think it’s a little bit bad for us not to have one. At the moment it’s all about the short-term goals. We don’t know how it’s going to be after the end of this season.” Although Rangnick has a chance of being appointed as the permanent manager, Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino and Ajax’s Erik ten Hag are the frontrunners. Rangnick takes United to Atlético Madrid for their Champions League last-16 first leg on Wednesday. Fred expects a feisty tie against Diego Simeone’s side, who are 15 points off Real Madrid at the summit of La Liga. “Even when not playing well, they’re a hard team to beat,” the Brazilian said. “Their manager is Argentinian, so they’re warriors, defend really well. They like a bit of a fight on the pitch and play collectively as a unit. So it really doesn’t matter if Atlético is going through a bad moment. It’s a match for players that have balls – pardon my French. They’re the most South American team in the Champions League.” Fred said he was aware of the criticism his displays can draw from United supporters. “It’s a mixed bag: some fans like me and others don’t,” he said. “It’s all about the results and they will dictate the supporters’ mood. But sometimes even with good results you’ll be criticised as well. “I’m not the best player, the most technical, but I give my blood and life every time I’m on the pitch. As we say in Brazil, I carry the piano for the artists to play. It’s been nice to play lately more as a box-to-box midfielder. It’s my favourite position – I’ve been creating chances and even scoring. It’s similar to the position I play internationally for Brazil.” The 28-year-oldHe embraces how his midfield partnership with Scott McTominay has been nicknamed “McFred”. “I like it,” he said. “I’m very happy to play alongside him but also it’s important to value every member of our midfield.” Bruno Fernandes believes United have more identity under Rangnick than under Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who was sacked in November. “We have to follow what the manager thinks is the best way for us,” Fernandes said. “In this club I never heard someone complain about the tactics. I hope no one will do that – it is not respectful to the manager. We have been doing so well since he arrived. We have more identity as a team, I think.”",Sport/Football,Fred says Rangnick’s interim status ‘a little bit bad’ for Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/fred-says-rangnicks-interim-status-a-little-bit-bad-for-manchester-united
2/23/2022,"The Australian Bureau of Statistics last week released a new report on Covid mortality in Australia. The data is important – it exposes the inequality in how the pandemic is affecting Australians, with deaths higher among people from lower socioeconomic areas, and shockingly high death rates for people born outside Australia. Experts told Guardian Australia a key reason for this is Australia’s reliance on migrants to undertake essential, insecure work and a failure of government to engage migrant communities early in pandemic planning.  These are issues rarely heard about from politicians and some media outlets during the pandemic, despite the trends being clear since at least August 2020. However, rightwing radio hosts and columnists saw something different in the figures – support for an ongoing narrative that lockdowns and other interventions represented an “overreaction” or were the result of a “scare campaign”. Paul Murray, on SkyNews Australia: Of the 2,639 deaths, 96.7% of those already had serious, life-threatening underlying health conditions … So, how many people have actually died, not with, but exclusively from Covid in Australia in the past couple of years? It is 83. Now every one of those is absolutely a tragedy, as is the two and a bit thousand before that. Murray went on to use this figure to question government responses: Get rid of the codes, pull down the borders, take care of the people that are most at risk. Ben Fordham, on 2GB and then repeated on news.com.au: We know Covid-19 is serious, but it doesn’t warrant the fear campaign we’ve been seeing. Today we have further proof. This isn’t opinion, it is certified data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Then later in the broadcast Fordham said: Again, let me be clear because some people take these stats the wrong way. We’re not playing down the situation, we’re not ignoring the grief of families. But these records expose the overblown scare campaign that we’ve witnessed. In 92% of our Covid-related deaths to 31 January each patient had roughly three other underlying health conditions. In other words it wasn’t just Covid that claimed their lives. And finally, he summed up: If you’re overweight or smoking, you’re putting yourself in danger, and you’re more likely to be in the 1% of Australians who have died with coronavirus. Yes, 1%. If you need any further evidence that it’s time to get on with our lives, you’ve just heard it. Rita Panahi, writing in the Herald Sun (the online version is different to the original): The Australian Bureau of Statistics put out some crucial data this week that should shame every alarmist bureaucrat, politician and media blowhard who championed lockdowns, school closures and mandates. Of the 2,639 deaths from or with Covid-19 in Australia, 2,556 had serious pre-existing conditions, on average three pre-existing conditions. That means more than 91% of Covid-19 deaths in Australia, up until 31 January 2022, had underlying health issues, with cancer, dementia and chronic cardiac conditions among the most common pre-existing conditions. And then later in the article, after comparing the number of Covid deaths to the annual number of deaths: It’s hard not to conclude we needlessly crippled our societies, debased our hard fought for liberties and caused untold damage to children, not to mention accumulating enormous debt and destroying countless lives and livelihoods. Joe Hildebrand, writing in news.com.au: And now we have formal confirmation from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that not only did so-called “Covid deaths” account for just 1% of fatalities during the pandemic, but 92% of that 1% were people with pre-existing health problems ranging from pneumonia to heart disease. All the scare-mongering was wrong, all the catastrophic predictions were wrong, all the fear and fury at lifting of restrictions was wrong, wrong, wrong. Besides the lack of originality in these opinion pieces, there are quite a few problems here. All of them managed to get at least one of the basic numbers from the ABS report wrong, with some of them messing up multiple stats. They’re also misrepresenting what the numbers actually mean. Paul Murray got both the number of people who died from Covid wrong, and the proportion of deaths where people had a chronic condition, prompting this fact check by AAP after his incorrect numbers were shared on Facebook and Twitter. The actual number of deaths where only Covid was reported on the death certificate was 220, not 83 – which is actually the number of people who died primarily due to something else, but who had also tested positive to Covid. The same mistake was made by the Herald Sun in a now-deleted tweet linking to Rita Panahi’s piece, which is strange as Panahi does not use the 83 figure. Fordham, Panahi, Hildebrand and Murray all got the percentage of Covid deaths with underlying health conditions wrong, citing 91% or 92% when it should actually be 69.5%. They’ve used the number of cases where only Covid was reported on the death certificate, which is 220 or 8.6% of total Covid deaths in this period, and subtracted this from the total. However, they should have included a further 560 deaths where another condition was “reported with causal sequence of events only”. This means those people did not have a pre-existing chronic condition prior to the chain of events leading to death, but conditions that developed due to Covid-19, such as pneumonia. While this may seem a bit complicated, the ABS clearly states within the same report the actual number of deaths with pre-existing chronic conditions in very plain terms: “Pre-existing chronic conditions were reported on death certificates for 1,776 (69.5%) of the 2,556 deaths due to Covid-19 deaths outlined in this report.” Another major issue is that several of these commentators imply that deaths are somehow not fully attributable to Covid if people had a chronic health condition. Again, the ABS report states in clear terms that this is not the case: “The majority [2,556] of these 2,639 deaths were due directly to Covid-19”. While various health conditions and other factors such as age can put you at an increased risk of dying if you catch Covid, it is an increased risk, not a guaranteed death sentence. To put it another way – if it weren’t for Covid these people would not have died when they did. It’s also important to realise that a very large number of Australians have chronic health conditions (I’ve got one myself!), so implying that deaths of entirely healthy people are somehow more important is unhelpful. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) estimates that 47% of Australians aged 18 and over had one or more chronic health conditions, and this rises to 60% in the 45 to 64 age bracket, and to 80% for those over 65. While the AIHW figures include conditions like back problems and mental and behavioural conditions not included in the ABS Covid deaths report, other figures show how widespread these conditions are. One in three Australians have high blood pressure, and a similar proportion of adults are obese. Both are on the list of the pre-existing chronic conditions listed in the ABS report. Unfortunately, according to data from social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, most of these articles have been enthusiastically shared by accounts known for sharing anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown conspiracy theories. This is likely because questioning how many deaths are actually due to Covid alone is an ongoing theme for these communities. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Another issue with several of the opinion pieces is that they make an argument that I’ve taken to calling the “Y2K fallacy“ for lack of a better term. They’re using the comparatively low number of Covid deaths relative to other deaths over the same period to make the argument that people overstated the seriousness of Covid or the need for various interventions. However, this ignores the fact that this comparatively low number of deaths has been achieved by interventions including lockdowns, border controls, mask rules and vaccinations, and without these, the death toll would have undoubtedly been higher. One estimate in October 2020 suggested Australia’s interventions may have saved 16,000 lives. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, suggested in May 2021 that Australia had avoided the loss of 30,000 lives. That’s not to say that every intervention necessarily worked, or that there wasn’t a health and financial cost to strict policies like lockdowns and border controls, but to argue that these death numbers show that we have “needlessly crippled our societies” is misleading in the extreme.",News/Australia news,Australian Bureau of Statistics report on Covid deaths misrepresented by rightwing media,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/australian-bureau-of-statistics-report-on-covid-deaths-misrepresented-by-rightwing-media
2/23/2022,"For Antonio Conte, defeat has always felt like a mortal insult, a scar on the soul, and it is not difficult to imagine how low he was after Tottenham’s shambolic home loss to Wolves on the Sunday before last. It came hard on the heels of the defeat against Southampton – also at home, also deserved – and nobody was particularly optimistic about their chances when they went to the Premier League leaders, Manchester City, on Saturday. Cue the Harry Kane-inspired 3-2 win, one of the shock results of the season and, certainly, the statement performance of Conte’s near four-month tenure. Kane scored two, including a 95th-minute winner, and might have had four but he helped to set the tone with his work rate, always “linking with the team defensively”, to borrow Conte’s words.  Conte’s players ran their socks off, they put their bodies on the line, they followed his tactical instructions to the letter. There was even a bit of nastiness, at times. And, for Conte, it added up to evidence that his messages about mentality were getting through. It is doubtful that anyone at Spurs will ever torture themselves quite so much as the manager after a bad result. But Conte suggested that those against Wolves and Southampton had stirred something in his players; something he wants to see again and again, picking up at Burnley on Wednesday night. “It’s very simple,” Conte said . “We lost two games against Wolverhampton and Southampton and then we won against City. The first step to change your mentality is, after a loss, you have to understand that you lost a game and, for sure, the atmosphere has to be different. When you lose a game and you come back to the training ground and, OK, it’s the same like yesterday … but yesterday you lost! “If we start to change the atmosphere, to understand that atmosphere also depends on the win or the defeat … because when you know that the atmosphere is different, you try during the game to do everything to have a good atmosphere the day after or two days after.” Conte brought up Bayern Munich, who suffered a shock Bundesliga defeat at Bochum on the Saturday before last and then drew at Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League. They got back on track with a home win over Greuther Fürth on Sunday. “I read that the Bayern players were very, very angry,” Conte said. “They said: ‘No. We can’t continue this way. We have to be strong.’ You show you are feeling that. The situation has to be different when you win and lose. Otherwise, if the atmosphere is always the same, always joy and celebrations, it will be very difficult to install the right mentality. You have to suffer. If you don’t suffer, it means that you don’t want to improve your winning mentality.” Conte can count on Kane and his goalkeeper and captain, Hugo Lloris, even if the latter made goal-costing errors against Wolves and City. “I continue to say that it’s important to match experienced players with young players because when you have players with experience, the young players learn a lot,” Conte said. “We are lucky to have these two players, who are top, top players.” Conte mentioned a somewhat injudicious line from his friend Pantaleo Corvino, the veteran sporting director at Lecce. “He says that you can make a mistake about your wife but not about your striker and goalkeeper – for me, that is the best quote I understand in football,” Conte said. And when asked whether the knock that Kane took to his back at City might rule him out of the Burnley game, Conte replied: “No. He had a hit in his back but he has to play. If he has one leg, he has to play.” Conte went on to say that he was only joking and he would never force an injured player to play, but, with Kane his only specialist, senior centre-forward, his tongue might not have been entirely in his cheek. It was striking, though, to see Conte in such upbeat mood. He has done plenty of complaining during his time at Spurs, especially about the level of his squad, stoking lots of creative tensions. Post-City, has something changed in him? In the aftermath of victory, Conte had described the group as the best he had coached. “I’m finding a lot of availability of these players to work, to improve, to have more football knowledge,” Conte said. “They are very open. And it’s not certain that this type of situation can happen in every team. Sometimes you find players who want to stay in their comfortable zone, saying: ‘OK, I had my career and I don’t want to prove [anything] and follow you.’ “I come to the training ground with a smile because I know I stay two to three hours with people who want to work seriously and follow a path to improve the level and try to go another step.”",Sport/Football,‘It’s simple’: Tottenham and Conte feel mood change after win at Man City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/tottenham-and-antonio-conte-feel-mood-change-after-win-at-city
2/23/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has said the punishing demands of a title race with Manchester City ensure Liverpool can never afford to “get a bit soft” in their pursuit of the Premier League leaders. Klopp’s team can close the gap to three points on Wednesday by winning their game in hand on City against Leeds at Anfield. Liverpool, who recently trailed Pep Guardiola’s team by 12 points, have won their past eight matches and suffered only two defeats in 48 games in all competitions. Klopp admits that relentlessness must continue to reclaim the title from City.  The Liverpool manager said: “Obviously both teams were able to do some special stuff, I have to say. With all respect, what Man City is doing is incredible and we are pushing each other as well. It is not only us because there is also Chelsea, United, Arsenal, Tottenham, whoever is there. I don’t forget all the other teams. But I think we can say we are pushing each other. It keeps you going. There is no chance to get a bit soft or whatever because the other one will be there immediately to catch you.” Guardiola jokingly referred to Liverpool recently as “a pain in the ass all the time” given the continued threat they pose to City in the Premier League and Champions League. Klopp concurred: “I think Pep said we are the pain in the … lower back. That is a good description and that is how it should be. “We try to be as annoying as possible until we have a chance to overtake. I don’t know when that will be or if it will be the case but in the decisive moments of the season – which is not now in February but in March or April – you have to be close enough to make a decision in your direction. “We have to be at our absolute best to play the best possible season for us. And unfortunately only twice a year we face the ‘other team’ in the Premier League. The first one was a draw when we were not brilliant but good enough to get a point. The next one has not been played yet and we play all the others as well. “It is just difficult, but what the boys did over the past four years is pretty special. I am happy with that but not overly happy where I think that is enough. We have to go from now on. So far it is not a bad season but the decisions will be made later. We just have to make sure that we are always in and around when these decisions are made.” Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino will again be absent against Leeds as they recover from ankle and muscle injuries respectively. The strikers have not been ruled out of Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Chelsea but Klopp cautioned: “They are not on the pitch for training and that is not a good sign.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp warns Liverpool not to ‘get soft’ in their Premier League title pursuit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/jurgen-klopp-warns-liverpool-not-to-get-soft-in-their-title-pursuit
2/23/2022,"The footballer Troy Deeney is launching an impassioned plea for more widespread teaching of black, Asian and minority ethnic experiences by schools in England, to help combat racism and give children “a balanced and inclusive understanding” of Britain. In an open letter to the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, Deeney said he had been frustrated by the lack of progress on tackling racism in the two years since the killing of George Floyd in the US, saying that “an eerie quiet” had ended public debate.  The Birmingham City striker said he was still receiving “vile racist abuse on social media and, at times, in public,” and with three children in the education system he felt an urgent need for schools to include black, Asian and minority ethnic experiences in their curriculum. “I have seen more and more how important it is for my children to be able to see themselves represented in what they are being taught, and learn about the contribution and background of people who look like them,” Deeney said. “The importance of education at an early age to inform identity and combat racist beliefs and stereotypes cannot be understated.” Deeney’s letter follows the success of Marcus Rashford, the England and Manchester United forward, in changing government policy. In 2020 and 2021, Rashford’s public interventions and a groundswell of support led to the government reversing its decision not to provide food for children eligible for free school meals during the school holidays in the midst of the Covid pandemic. Deeney, who signed for Birmingham City this season after playing almost 400 games for Watford, is launching an online petition. He has commissioned research by the polling company YouGov into teachers’ attitudes to rebut claims that the national curriculum in England already contains ample black and minority ethnic representation. The survey of 1,000 secondary and primary school teachers, carried out this month, found that only 12% felt empowered to teach “optional” black-related topics such as colonialism, migration and identity ahead of competing optional topics, while 75% said they were not aware that resources to teach cultural diversity across the curriculum were available. It found that 54% of teachers believed the school system or national curriculum has a racial bias, rising to 93% among minority ethnic teachers. “My only experience of black history or black culture was through the food or music I experienced at home, whilst at school I felt detached. Not only was I not taught about positive role models who looked like me, I was even told by one teacher that I’d be dead by the time I was 25,” Deeney said. He was excluded from school at the age of 15 and left without any qualifications.

2/23/2022,"Wales have been warned to expect a fast and furious welcome from England at Twickenham on Saturday in a game the home team are billing as a knockout eliminator. With Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes back, Eddie Jones’s side are determined to up the tempo and improve their chances of claiming this year’s Six Nations title. According to Jones’s assistant Martin Gleeson, the former Great Britain rugby league international who is now England’s attack coach, there is a realisation among the players that, as at a World Cup, they must now win their final three games to hoist the trophy.  “It’s a massive game for us,” Gleeson said. “It’s the first time crowds have been back for a Six Nations game for a couple of years and we’re treating it like a quarter-final. If we don’t get the result on Saturday, we’re out.” Gleeson will be urging his side to take the game to Wales from the outset, having rated their training session on Tuesday as the best he has seen since he took the job last August. “We want to take it to them as quickly and early in the game as possible,” he said. “We don’t want to be playing in our shell. We want to play the brand of rugby we want straight from the kick-off. We need to have some line speed in defence and hit hard. When we’ve got the ball there’s a few opportunities we can see. We want to play with intent and go after teams.” This go-faster mission statement would appear perfectly suited to a player like Tuilagi, set to feature for the first time since damaging a hamstring against South Africa in the autumn. The statistician Russ Petty has even dug into the archives and found that England have not lost at Twickenham with Tuilagi in their matchday squad since November 2012. “Manu can just take the ball, make metres and get us quick ruck ball by himself. Not everyone can do that,” Gleeson said. “That’s why Manu is the player he is. He’s a guy who can add another dimension to your attack. You don’t always have to create overlaps or gaps in defences; he can punch holes on his own. His acceleration and the power with that is phenomenal. He’ll be good to have in the mix.” The winds of change, though, continue to blow, with two experienced Joes – Marchant and Launchbury – released from the squad last night. In recent days, too, two members of England’s matchday squad from their 2019 Rugby World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand have signalled their retirements, with George Kruis set to join Mark Wilson in stepping away from the game at the age of 32. Both Kruis and Wilson were popular squad men and highly valuable players, with 68 caps for England between them. The former is quitting to devote more time to his burgeoning business career while injury has finally caught up with the latter but, in their different ways, both underline the fierce dedication and sacrifice required to stay at the top of the professional game. It also shows just how swiftly the picture can change from a team-building perspective. There had been talk of Kruis returning to the Premiership with a view to chasing a place in next year’s World Cup in France. Instead Jones and his assistants will have to hope their forward options remain deep enough for it not to matter unduly if they lose any more big men between now and the autumn of 2023. Equally important, though, is to bed in some lasting combinations in key areas rather than simply adding random individuals to the mix here and there. Ben Youngs is set to become England’s most capped player in history this weekend but will be 34 by the time next year’s World Cup kicks off. England’s other two scrum-halves, Harry Randall and Raffi Quirke, have barely started their Test careers and no team in history has won the Webb Ellis Cup with a relative rookie in the No 9 jersey. Tuilagi and Henry Slade, however, are already a proven midfield double act and, with Owen Farrell still sidelined by injury, the big centre has been seeking to establish a good understanding with Marcus Smith. The pair roomed together during England’s training camp in Jersey and Tuilagi has been trying to put the squad’s younger players at ease. “You don’t want them to feel pressure,” the 30-year-old said. “We were just relaxing with nice tea and a couple of biscuits, nice shortbread. That’s the important thing … to connect and get to know each other.”",Sport/Sport,England warn Wales to expect furious welcome with Tuilagi and Lawes back,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/22/england-warn-wales-to-expect-furious-welcome-with-tuilagi-and-lawes-back
2/23/2022,"Looking at the positives from Thomas Tuchel’s big selection call, at least Romelu Lukaku has a better understanding of how Chelsea aspire to play now. This was a flexible and smart performance from the European champions, who functioned perfectly well with their £97.5m conundrum watching from the bench for the entire 90 minutes, and on this evidence Lukaku could be forgiven for wondering if his new diminished role is here to stay.  After all there is little reason for Tuchel to bring the Belgian back when Chelsea meet Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday. It could well be further humiliation for Lukaku after this comfortable win against Lille. Chelsea were far more effective with Kai Havertz offering movement, mobility and incision up front and they have a firm grip on this last-16 tie after the impressive Christian Pulisic gave them a 2-0 lead to take to France next month, by which point Lukaku might already be plotting his path back to Internazionale. The increasing sense is that a clean break would suit all parties. “A look of tiredness” was how Tuchel had explained his decision to drop Chelsea’s record signing but nobody was buying that. As ever the evidence was on the pitch. Lukaku had mustered a mere seven touches against Crystal Palace in his previous outing, the fewest registered by any Premier League player over 90 minutes since Opta began keeping track in 2003. Numbers of such anonymity made it simple for Tuchel, who seemed to be on to something by picking a front three that gave his side pace, trickery and unpredictability in the final third. It was a controversial decision, though, and one that Tuchel needed to come off. Chelsea have stumbled of late, their title challenge unravelling during a bleak winter period, injuries taking a toll. The next drama has never felt far away and, although there was a nice moment before kick-off – the injured trio of Ben Chilwell, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Reece James parading the club’s latest trophy around the pitch – the crowd’s applause was accompanied by an awareness that this season is not going to be defined by Club World Cup glory. This was more important than Abu Dhabi and it looked as if Chelsea knew it early on. Pulisic took the game to Lille with some snaking runs and the opening goal should have arrived inside four minutes, Havertz somehow turning César Azpilicueta’s cross over from close range. Would Lukaku have scored? Probably. The point, though, is that Chelsea are far more fluid with Havertz operating as a false nine. His graceful movement unsettled Sven Botman and José Fonte, Lille’s centre-backs, and he quickly put his early miss behind him, shifting inside before drawing an excellent save from Léo Jardim after seven minutes. Eleventh in Ligue 1, Lille soon cracked. Hakim Ziyech lifted in a corner from the left and Havertz made it look easy in the middle, rising unmarked to send a bouncing header beyond Jardim. Tuchel had his vindication. For a while, with N’Golo Kanté and Mateo Kovacic controlling midfield, it was one-way traffic. Marcos Alonso went close with a volley. Pulisic kept running. Havertz floated around menacingly. Cautiously, though, Lille came into the contest. Tuchel grew irritable, roaring when Ziyech wasted a chance to shoot. Chelsea were making too many mistakes and Lille were growing in confidence. Jonathan Bamba and Jonathan David looked dangerous and Chelsea, who survived a few skirmishes in their area, were relieved to escape when Antonio Rüdiger almost sliced Renato Sanches’s cross past Édouard Mendy. Lille had hope after the break. Azpilicueta was working hard to contain Bamba and Chelsea were starting to retreat. Too many counterattacks were fizzling out and the worries for Tuchel increased when Kovacic made way for Ruben Loftus-Cheek before hobbling down the tunnel. Chelsea were wavering. Alonso had a volley blocked by Zeki Celik and Havertz fired over, but the game had become bitty and Tuchel was forced into another adjustment when Ziyech went down with an ankle problem just before the hour. That, though, allowed Tuchel to regain control. He chose to bring on Saúl Ñíguez instead of another attacker and more bodies in the middle meant there was a chance to release Kanté, who accepted his new role with relish, dousing Lille’s optimism with the run that led to Chelsea’s second goal. The surge came out of nowhere. Suddenly, after an aimless Lille attack broke down, Kanté was tearing through the middle and carrying Chelsea up the pitch. Nobody could keep up with him and there was quality at the end of the run, the midfielder’s weighted pass sending Pulisic through to score with a lovely dink. It was a deserved goal for Pulisic and Chelsea were able to relax. Andreas Christensen, Thiago Silva and Rüdiger were determined to protect the clean sheet and the introduction of Hatem Ben Arfa was not enough for Lille, though at least the former Newcastle winger got on the pitch. With Timo Werner sent on before him, the same could not be said of Lukaku.",Sport/Football,Kai Havertz and Christian Pulisic give Chelsea healthy advantage over Lille,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/chelsea-lille-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report
2/23/2022,"Students from disadvantaged backgrounds in England could be blocked from going to university unless they get strong GCSE or A-level grades, under proposals to be announced by the government this week. On Thursday the government is to publish its long-awaited response to the Augar review of higher education funding, and the Guardian has learned that a key part of the response will be the launch of a consultation on minimum entry requirements for students to be eligible for government-backed loans for tuition and maintenance.  University leaders warn that setting minimum entry requirements too high, such as requiring a grade 5 in GCSE maths and English, would effectively end the hopes of many school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds and others who could not be able to afford the £9,250 annual undergraduate tuition fee or living expenses without student loans. A key determinant will be whether a GCSE grade 4 or 5 is determined to be the minimum entry standard. About 71% of pupils in England achieve a grade 4 in GCSE English and maths, falling to 52% amoung disadvantaged households. Bridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “After nearly three years of inaction, this meagre response shows the government does not share the ambitions of young people and their families for their futures and the future of our country. “Instead of looking to widen access to university education, or supporting the success of our universities, the government is slamming the door on opportunity.” A DfE spokesperson said: “Higher education is an investment and we need to ensure that graduates are being rewarded for the money, time and effort they put into their studies with an educational experience and jobs that match their skills and help contribute to the economy.” The announcement comes as record numbers of school leavers apply for undergraduate places. The Department for Education has been battling with the Treasury over the cost of financing for nearly three years since the Augar review was published under the then prime minister Theresa May. A further consultation will be announced on the future of foundation year courses taught at universities. Those are offered to students who don’t meet an institution’s academic requirements and remain a key point of access for many, especially mature students. However, the Augar review recommended that foundation years be restricted to further education colleges. Other headline measures to be announced include the freezing of the tuition fee at £9,250 for another two years, until the end of the current parliament. That will result in an effective cut in university incomes from teaching undergraduates, with the value of the tuition fee already considerably eroded by inflation. In real terms its value by 2024 is likely to be much less than £7,000, depending on the rate of inflation. The government will also announce a similar freeze on the threshold earnings for student loan repayments, hitting recent graduates who will find themselves having to make higher repayments as their wages rise more quickly above the threshold. Earlier this year the DfE announced that the repayment threshold – the amount at which graduates in England pay off their student loans – would be frozen at £27,295, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates would cost graduates earning £30,000 an extra £113 a year each. The IFS also calculated that the move would save the Treasury around £600m a year in higher repayments than it would have received if the threshold had been indexed to inflation as originally intended. However, the proposals to be unveiled on Thursday are expected to include some good news on capping the interest charged on student loans, although that will have no immediate effect on the level of repayments. The consultation is the government’s long delayed response to the Augar review of post-18 education and funding in England, which was announced by former prime minister Teresa May in February 2018 after Labour’s buoyant performance in the 2017 general election, thanks in part to its pledge to scrap student tuition fees. The review was launched at a time of mounting concern about the cost – and value – of higher education, after annual tuition fees rose to £9,250 and maintenance grants were scrapped, sending individual student debt spiralling to almost £50,000. When it finally reported on 30 May 2019, it included 53 recommendations on the future for the sector, including a reduction of tuition fees to £7,500, an extension of student loan repayments from 30 to 40 years and the reintroduction of maintenance grants for the most disadvantaged students. However, as time has gone on and the political climate has changed, many of Augar’s recommendations have looked increasingly unlikely. With outstanding student loans reaching £140bn last year the Treasury’s priority has been to reduce the cost of student loans to itself rather than ease the burden on students. Higher education staff and management are currently locked in a bitter industrial dispute over pensions, pay and working conditions. On Tuesday evening a key negotiating committee of the University Superannuation Scheme, which administers the pension fund for many university staff, rejected funding proposals by the University and College Union in favour of those put forward by the employers. Jo Grady, the UCU chair, warned that the decision would lead to further industrial action. “University vice-chancellors have today chosen to steal tens of thousands from the retirement income of staff. This is a deplorable attack which our members won’t take lying down,” Grady said.",News/Education,Fears that minimum grades for student loans in England could narrow access ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/22/fears-that-minimum-grades-for-student-loans-in-england-could-narrow-access
2/23/2022,"Musician Mark Lanegan has died at the age of 57. The singer, songwriter and musician was known as the lead vocalist for Screaming Trees as well as being part of Queens of the Stone Age.  “Our beloved friend Mark Lanegan passed away this morning at his home in Killarney, Ireland,” read a statement posted to his Twitter account. “A beloved singer, songwriter, author and musician he was 57 and is survived by his wife Shelley. No other information is available at this time. The family asks everyone to respect their privacy at this time.” The American singer, born and raised in rural eastern Washington state, had survived a battle with Covid-19 that left him in and out of a coma for months-long stretches of 2021. His memoir Devil in a Coma, published last December, detailed his tortuous near-death experience, which included a Covid-induced fall that cracked ribs and a painful hospital stay laced with recurring hallucinations. “More and more this was reminiscent of an unending stretch in county jail that I couldn’t shake, with my trial date being intentionally undetermined, constantly moved around just to keep me inside,” he wrote in an excerpt published in the Guardian. “Whatever was in this shitwagon I’d caught a ride on, it was no fucking joke. I’d taken my share of well-deserved ass-kickings over the years but this thing was trying to dismantle me, body and mind, and I could see no end to it in sight.” Once a long-time drug user and friend of Kurt Cobain, Jeffrey Lee Pierce of the Gun Club, and Alice in Chains’s Layne Staley – all of which he detailed in his 2020 memoir Sing Backwards and Weep – Lanegan was called “rock’s great survivor”. By 12, according to his memoir, he was a “compulsive gambler, a fledgling alcoholic, a thief, a porno fiend”. By 18, he had a lengthy criminal record which included breaking and entering, shoplifting, drug possession, vandalism, insurance fraud and 26 counts of underage drinking. “I wanted excitement, adventure, decadence, depravity, anything, everything,” he wrote in Sing Backwards and Weeps. Lanegan had been clean for more than a decade at the time of his death. In 1985, at age 21, Lanegan was working for a video store in his hometown of Ellensburg, Washington – what he described as a “dusty, isolated cow town” – when he formed a band with his boss’s sons, guitarist Gary Lee Conner and bassist Van Conner. The Screaming Trees would go on to record seven studio albums before their breakup in 2000, and rose to fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s centered around Seattle. (An eighth album, Last Words: The Final Recordings, which was recorded in 1998-1999, was released by drummer Barrett Martin’s label in 2011.) Lanegan also embarked on a solo career during the peak of the band’s fame. His 1990 solo debut The Winding Sheet included appearances from Cobain and Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, and numerous grunge figures appeared on subsequent releases Whiskey for the Holy Ghost, Scraps at Midnight and the collection of covers I’ll Take Care of You. Langean wrote his 2020 memoir at the encouragement of close friend Anthony Bourdain, the celebrity chef and TV host who died by suicide in 2018. Lanegan penned an obituary for Bourdain in the Observer. “Anthony said, ‘There needs be a level of honesty beyond what you’ll be comfortable with for it not to be some crappy rock autobiography,’” Lanegan told the Guardian in 2020. “That was the last thing I wanted to do, ever. This might sound ridiculous, but if it’s not literature, I didn’t want to do it.” Numerous musicians, many from the rock scene, paid tribute to Lanegan in the wake of his death. “Mark Lanegan rest easy mate. A real singer,” tweeted British post-punk duo Sleaford Mods. “Oh no. Terrible news that Mark Lanegan has left us. Safe travels man – you’ll be missed,” tweeted musician Tim Burgess of the Charlatans. “I am in absolute shock, a very beautiful soul has left this world. I love you brother,” tweeted friend and fellow musician Anton Newcombe. The English musician Damon Gough, who uses the stage name Badly Drawn Boy, tweeted that news of Lanegan’s death “properly stopped me in my tracks. I’m absolutely gutted. Met him on a couple of occasions and I was nervous because I loved him so much. He was a perfect gentleman, really kind. One of THE great singers of the last 30 years.” Lanegan was “a supremely gifted performer, songwriter, artist and author, and we are devastated to hear he has passed away,” his UK publishing house, White Rabbit Books, said in a statement posted to Twitter. “His art will endure and only grow in stature.” Lanegan is survived by his second wife, Shelley Brien.",Arts/Music,"Mark Lanegan, Screaming Trees singer, dies at 57",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/22/mark-lanegan-screaming-trees-singer-dies

2/23/2022,"Ministers are subjecting the families of Commonwealth military veterans to “deeply unjust” visa fees after pleas to waive the costly sums for spouses and children were rejected, two MPs have argued. Labour’s Dan Jarvis and the former Conservative minister Johnny Mercer criticised the government for removing the £2,389 immigration bill only for long-serving veterans.  The Ministry of Defence and the Home Office had planned to announce the fee waiver, which would have applied to Nepali, Fijian and other Commonwealth veterans who had served six years or more on Wednesday. But by excluding partners and dependents, the MPs said on Tuesday night it would still leave veterans facing thousands of pounds of Home Office bills to resolve their family’s immigration status when they are discharged from service. “We remain concerned that families continue to be sidelined – this amounts to a 25% discount on a £10,000 visa fee bill for a family of four,” the two MPs said. “It is deeply unjust for the government to profit from them exercising their right to remain in the country for which they risked their lives.” The two MPs, both veterans, went public the night before the announcement, arguing that people who had a “long and proud history” of serving in the British armed forces would still be poorly treated. Britain has long used foreign-born soldiers in its armed forces. Nearly 7% of troops come from outside the UK, most notably Nepali Gurkhas and Fijians, who have served in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Veterans who served a minimum period had the right to UK citizenship, but bureaucratic errors, poor advice and increased feeshave left some as illegal immigrants in the country for which they once served. One, Taitusi Ratacaucau, was told he needed to pay more than £50,000 to cover NHS hospital bills after an emergency operation to remove a brain tumour in 2020 because he was no longer considered a British citizen. Ratacaucau and seven others tried and failed to win a legal battle to have their visa fees waived – but were eventually granted leave to remain in the UK last year by the Home Office after a high profile campaign. The campaign group Citizenship4Soldiers said they also wanted ministers to ensure the fee waiver would be backdated, estimating that there are 600 Fijian veterans who could benefit. The group also said it was concerned that “families have been excluded”. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary said he was “delighted to announce” that serving personnel and veterans who have served for six years or more “will no longer have to pay the visa fee”.

2/23/2022,"The supreme court has formally rejected Donald Trump’s request to block the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack from accessing White House records related to the events of 6 January 2021.  The court announced on Tuesday in its latest list of orders that it would not take up Trump’s appeal to a lower-court ruling allowing the select committee access to the documents. The news comes a month after the supreme court rejected Trump’s emergency motion to block the release of the documents as his case regarding executive privilege claims made its way through the courts. That January ruling cleared the way for the select committee to start receiving Trump White House documents. They have already started combing through the records. Seven people died as a result of the attack on the US Capitol by supporters Trump told to “fight like hell” in service of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. The attack did not prevent certification of electoral college results, though 147 Republicans in the House and Senate did lodge objections. More than 100 police officers were injured. More than 700 people have been charged. Eleven people, members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, face charges of seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection, but acquitted when enough Republican senators stayed loyal. Only two Republicans, Trump critics Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, sit on the House select committee investigating January 6 and Trump’s attempts to overturn the election. The committee is working quickly, given Republicans’ expected takeover of the House after midterm elections in November. Public hearings are believed to be on the way and key aides to Trump have been served with subpoenas or asked to co-operate. Few have. Steve Bannon, a former White House strategist and key figure on the pro-Trump far right, has pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress – a criminal charge carrying jail time. Others including the former chief of staff Mark Meadows have refused to co-operate. Members of the panel have said they expect Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer and a key figure in attempts to overturn the election, to testify. The supreme court’s formal rejection of Trump’s attempt to keep White House records away from the committee was not a surprise. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, said on Twitter: “Trump’s baseless and brazen attempt to keep the January 6 select committee from obtaining his White House records has now been turned down by the supreme court of the United States. No surprise there, but with this court one never knows until one knows …” The court is currently imbalanced 6-3 in favor of conservatives, after Trump appointed three justices in his single four-year term in office. Clarence Thomas, who was appointed by George HW Bush, was the only justice who said he would have granted Trump’s attempt to stop the January 6 committee gaining access to his records. Thomas and his wife were the subject of an extensive New York Times profile published on Tuesday. Ginni Thomas is a conservative activist with close connections to pro-Trump groups. Dustin Stockton, a conservative organizer with ties to Bannon, told the paper that Ginni Thomas was tasked with coordinating rightwing groups around Trump’s rally near the White House before the Capitol attack, so “there wouldn’t be any division”. “The way it was presented to me was that Ginni was uniting these different factions around a singular mission on 6 January” Stockton told the paper. “That Ginni was involved made sense – she’s pretty neutral and she doesn’t have a lot of enemies in the movement.” Questions about Clarence Thomas’s role on the court given his wife’s work have mounted since the New Yorker published a lengthy piece of its own last month. Neither the justice nor Ginni Thomas has commented.",News/US news,Supreme court rejects Trump’s request to block access to January 6 records,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/us-supreme-court-upholds-access-to-trump-white-house-records-insurrection-january-6

As well as her year-round duties helming a range of gourmet foods plus a shop and restaurant in the Barossa Valley, Australia’s most endearing celebrity cook is in a particularly busy period. She is back in the judging seat for The Great Australian Bake Off and is also gearing up for this year’s Tasting Australia festival. But she took some time out to share with us the stories of three important belongings. “Watching the steadfast mother-daughter relationships of my patients through health and sickness gives me hope for mine,” Ranjana Srivastava writes. “I talk to my mother every day and assume she knows I cherish her. But lately, I realise that of all my daughter’s gestures, the one that makes my heart brim is when, without expectation or invitation, she tells me that I am a good mother. This reward transcends all achievements and all incentives.” Penelope Spheeris’s trilogy about LA’s punk and hair metal scenes, The Decline of Western Civilization, is both hopeful and bleak, with revealing interviews with future icons, Nathan Jolly writes. “Featuring rough-ready footage shot at gigs and candid interviews with future punk icons, this film is a slim time capsule of a nascent music scene not yet exploited through commerce or destroyed by day jobs. Spheeris enters a world filled with runaways, drug addicts and squatters, where audience members spit on bands to signal some form of vile, violent appreciation.” As debate over the religious discrimination bill – and the right for religious schools to expel transgender kids – reached fever pitch this month, the Rev Josephine Inkpin carried on with the business of providing solace to those in need. In today’s Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to the first transgender minister appointed in a mainstream church about breaking ground, hope and why the battle for inclusion isn’t over.

2/23/2022,"The opening goal came from a corner after four minutes, the game exactly where they wanted it already. There was a lead to defend and so they did, an hour passing before the second arrived. Breaking from their own area after a corner, wide spaces suddenly appeared before them and an open goal did too, the shot curling in from 40 yards with the goalkeeper off his line. Two touches was all it took, the ultimate in efficiency. Then, in the last minute, another break and it was over. Five shots, three goals, a clean sheet: how very Atlético. Er, no. Not really, not any more.  On Saturday Atlético Madrid prepared for their meeting with Manchester United by defeating Osasuna 3-0 at El Sadar. It was the day Liverpool faced Norwich so of course Luis Suárez scored, and from miles out. Jan Oblak made four times as many saves as his opposite number. Sime Vrsaljko got away with a hand in an opponent’s face. And Atlético, lined up in a 4-4-2, had 37% of possession but neither wanted nor needed more. “The little details went against us,” the Osasuna coach, Jagoba Arrasate, said. This was “Classic Atlético”, one newspaper said but those two words were not the point; the truly key words were the other three they used: the, return and of. That was what made it so significant, why the central defender Stefan Savic insisted: “It was important for us to win again and do it with our DNA, which is to be strong at the back and effective up front.” But: is it? Still? And might Saturday’s win, their self-awakening, have been a one-off, another false dawn? The question that hangs over Atlético as the Champions League returns is not just how they are but who they are. On Tuesday Ralf Rangnick talked about Atlético as an “emotional side” that “reflects the character of their manager”. Diego Simeone, he said, “has won trophies with a clear identity, with a recognisable playing style. I don’t think that has changed in the last years.” But that was already not entirely true and now it is even less the case. At times this can feel like a team suffering an identity crisis. Atlético are a side that has periodically evolved one way and then back again, as if wanting to return to what they know, to revert to type. There have been shifts, glimpses of doubts about what they want to be, hints that players and manager do not always reach the same conclusion or believe in the same things. Last season they certainly did not play as they had in previous campaigns, Suárez the catalyst for them occupying different positions. They did not even play the same way at the start of the season as they did at the end, the season’s close almost absurdly epic. This season, though, has been a step again, deeper into uncertainty. All those things you think you know about them, all those assumptions, the lines that are endlessly repeated: forget them. Certainly don’t trust them. Savic might will them to be real, Simeone too, but the truth is different. Osasuna was their first clean sheet away all season. Three days later they were beaten at home by Levante, who are bottom. It was their 10th defeat but at least it was 1-0. In the previous four matches the team whose results once read like binary code ran: 4-3, 4-2, 3-2 and 2-2. That 4-2 is a loss at Barcelona when Atlético took an early lead. The 4-3 and 3-2 are consecutive last-minute comebacks at home, against Valencia and Getafe respectively, exhilarating evenings that also revealed flaws, the promise of revival proving fleeting. Both were followed by defeats and it is not just that they are losing, it is the way it is happening. For so long defined by their defence – a team that are tough, organised, ultra-competitive – Atlético are not good at the things Atlético are supposed to be good at. They have had twice as many 2-2 draws as 1-0 wins. They have already conceded more than in any of the 10 seasons under Simeone, seemingly always on edge even when they win. In Europe, they were beaten 3-2 by Liverpool, having come back from 2-0 down, and progressed on the final day with just their second win, goals in the 90th and 92nd minutes finally seeing them through in Porto. In Milan they had needed a 97th-minute penalty. No longer occupying a Champions League place, domestically last season’s champions are fifth, 15 points off the top. “You start to think: ‘Why is this happening to us?’” Ángel Correa admitted. “So why is it?” he was asked, to which he replied: “I don’t know. I couldn’t explain it but it’s a reality.” Marcos Llorente, their outstanding player last season from midfield, has been injured and, when he has played, has often done so at full-back. Savic and José Mariá Giménez have been able to play together less than a third of the campaign, the former insisting: “We have been affected by injuries, which have made it harder for the manager to choose a system.” Oblak looks human, his save percentage plummeting. Antoine Griezmann has been injured. Suárez is a year older, the revenge that fuelled him running lower now, the astonishing effectiveness unsustainable. Koke has not reached the level he was at last season. Kieran Trippier has gone. “His exit has changed us for sure,” Savic admitted. But part of the problem may be exactly that: that they are champions. They then signed Rodrigo De Paul, Griezmann and Matheus Cunha, many saying this was the best squad they had had, declaring them favourites. That was probably an exaggeration anyway but it changes things, even if only at some subconscious level. When it comes to group management too, and perhaps at mechanical level. From playing against the power they had to administer abundance: the team has changed 32 times in 34 games. “For a team like Atlético it’s not easy to be champions,” Simeone said. “We created expectations and when the results didn’t arrive that hit us hard,” Correa told Marca. The margins are sometimes fine and fortune plays a part – last season, it is worth recalling, they were on edge all the way to the line, suffering and surviving Simeone talking about them entering the Suárez Zone. The underlying statistics are also not as bad as the results but there is something not right, something missing –an edge, a sense of cause, a decisiveness. “We’ve conceded the fewest shots but it felt like every shot went in,” Savic said. “There was also a relaxation defensively.” Simeone referred to a “lack of attention”. “When you win the league, lots of teams relax because they say ‘well, it’s happened’,” the defender Giménez said. “Four new players came and the team relaxes a bit. Last season, games started and we would bite. This year, I see a slight relaxation in comparison. We were first to the challenges, the loose balls, we were aggressive in the areas, we defended games to the end. This year, that wasn’t happening. Why? Because we have a great team, but a great team is built on results too.” The results were not right, the route to them no longer clear, until Saturday offered a way back to how they were. “We’re united. But it’s not words; it’s bodies that show that unity best, and in Pamplona we saw it. I have no doubt we’re on the right path,” Savic insisted. “I cling to the search for the team spirit we saw the other day,” Simeone said. “I hope we have that spirit tomorrow because, when we have that, we compete well.”",Sport/Football,Can Diego Simeone recapture the ‘classic’ Atlético Madrid | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/can-diego-simeone-recapture-the-classic-atletico-madrid
2/23/2022,"Call me old fashioned, but I’d rather Boris Johnson wasn’t prime minister when Russia invaded Ukraine. Serious times call for serious leaders and Johnson is a profoundly unserious person. This isn’t about the lies and the parties: it’s about being led by someone who doesn’t aspire to be more than a music hall act. Albeit one with a limpet-like narcissism that keeps him clinging to the top job. That said, Johnson has had a goodish war so far. Partly because he has been so distracted by filling in police questionnaires that it’s only recently he seems to have noticed there was a situation developing in eastern Europe. But also because he has got some of the basics right. OK, so he looked a total wreck at the Munich security conference, arriving with the toddler haircut all over the place, his eyes stuck half shut, his tie askew and his shirt crumpled. But the content of his speech more or less hit the right mark. At least, he didn’t lose his place or ad lib about Peppa Pig World. Small victories and all that.  And when he came to update the Commons on Monday night’s invasion of Ukraine by Russian tanks, the Suspect at first looked as if he would again pull off the required trick of sounding like a grownup. He was heard in near silence as he ran through Vladimir Putin’s crimes and the failed attempts of western allies to talk him down from invading Ukraine. But now a line had been breached with Russian troops entering the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. It was time to make Putin really sweat with sanctions that would hurt him, said Johnson. Only the sanctions he came up with – five relatively small Russian banks and three oligarchs – didn’t sound as if they would cause the Russian leader to lose a moment’s sleep. If that was the best the UK could come up with in response to the invasion so far, then Putin might as well make a bee-line for Kyiv. Compared with Germany’s decision to cancel the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, the UK’s response looked like pissing in the wind. Don’t panic, the Suspect, continued. Because this was just a graduated response. It was best to start with little sanctions. Sanctionettes in response to what was still only a minor invasion. That way we could build up to proper sanctions later. It didn’t seem to have occurred to Johnson that even as he spoke, Russian oligarchs were already moving their money out of UK assets that could be the subject of sanctions in the coming days and weeks. No matter. It was only friendly to give Russia ample warning. And he could be tough if he wanted to. If he could persuade Liz Truss to give up the tank she has on permanent call for a photoshoot, he would send it to the Ukrainian defence force. It could make all the difference. Still, this was a day for parliament to put on a united front and it did so. Though not quite in the way Johnson might have expected. There were no MPs on the Labour left to suggest that Nato might have been a bit provocative and it was time to give Russia the benefit of the doubt. It’s possible that Jeremy Corbyn had just that argument in mind but he arrived in the chamber too late to be called to speak and sat morosely on his own for about 15 minutes before leaving. So we’ll never know. Maybe he would have surprised us all by launching a blistering attack on Russian aggression. Instead that was left to Keir Starmer, who along with many other Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs, not only deplored Putin’s brutal authoritarianism but demanded stronger action. It was clear that Russia had invaded Ukraine so what was stopping the UK government from imposing tougher sanctions now? Sequencing sanctions was all very well but surely the baseline response should have been to exclude Russia from financial mechanisms like Swift and to ban trading in Russian sovereign debt? Labour’s Ben Bradshaw observed that the three individuals who had been sanctioned had all been put on a US sanctions list four years ago. So they were all old lags at this kind of thing and the new penalties imposed on them wouldn’t make the slightest difference. Surely there must be some others among the dozens of oligarchs close to Putin who were worthy of some kind of sanction? Johnson hummed and hawed. He was fairly sure Roman Abramovich had been sanctioned. If only. As it turns out – Abramovich has never been sanctioned. Pity, as the thought of Chelsea being stripped of its assets and relegated to League Two could unite the entire country. All but 45,000 of it. And they don’t count. Besides, you had to remember that if you used up your sanctions all at once then you might not have any left for later. Then again, if you didn’t – as countless other MPs pointed out – you merely encouraged Putin to go for broke. Caroline Lucas and Labour’s Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi cut to the chase. Was the prime minister sure that weak sanctions had nothing to do with Russian Tory party donors, oligarchs playing tennis with Tory ministers, appointing Russians to the House of Lords or Russian interference in UK elections? Absolutely not, the Suspect insisted. Perish the thought. One mustn’t get carried away by Russophobia. He only played tennis with the very nicest and very richest Russians. As you do. With that Johnson scarpered for the exit, wondering how he had managed to let himself be outflanked by the entire Commons.

2/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will support the territorial claims of its proxy states in east Ukraine, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future in what Joe Biden denounced as an attempt to carve out “a big chunk” of the country. “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries?” Biden said, announcing new sanctions on two Russian banks and sweeping measures to stop Russia raising capital in western markets.  In a dramatic move Germany halted the approval process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, while the EU and the UK announced sanctions on Russia in a show of concerted western resolve, with EU foreign ministers banning Russian bond trades in the European market. Boris Johnson revealed a package of asset freezes on five Russian banks and three high net worth individuals but faced criticism from his MPs for not going further. The UK, US and EU could all bring in further sanctions. On Tuesday evening US secretary of state Antony Blinken said a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that had been scheduled for Thursday would not go ahead. “Now that we see the invasion is beginning and Russia has made clear its wholesale rejection of diplomacy, it does not make sense to go forward with that meeting at this time,” he said. Shrugging off threats of economic isolation, Putin enlarged the scope of Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference, he said that Russia recognised the borders claimed by the self-proclaimed “people’s republics” which are well beyond the current frontline and include substantial territories, including towns and cities still under Ukrainian government control. “We have recognised the independence of these republics, which means we have recognised all their fundamental documents, including the constitution. And the constitution prescribes the borders within the Donetsk and Luhansk regions at the time when they were part of Ukraine,” Putin said. Russian troops have already crossed into Ukraine in the Moscow-controlled territories up to the frontline. Putin’s legalistic remarks implied they could go further in the name of defending their proxy states. Any Ukrainian response could then be used to justify a full-scale, multi-pronged invasion of the kind the US and its allies have been predicting. “We still believe that Russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against Ukraine. I hope I am wrong about that,” Biden said, noting that Russia has moved supplies of blood towards the border. “You don’t need blood unless you plan on starting a war,” he said. The president said he would send US reinforcements to the Baltic nations on Nato’s eastern flank, but stressed they were “totally defensive moves on our part”. “We have no intention of fighting Russia,” he said. Russia said on Tuesday it was evacuating its diplomats from Ukraine, citing concerns about their safety. Putin also received approval from his Federation Council on Tuesday to use the armed forces abroad. The decision indicated that they would be used in a “peacekeeping” force in south-east Ukraine but has raised concerns that Russian legislators have just green-lighted an all-out assault on Ukraine. Putin last appealed to the Federation Council for a similar authorisation when he intervened in the Syrian conflict in 2015. He has never requested a similar authorisation to send troops to Ukraine, despite evidence that Russian forces have, in fact, fought there since 2014. Putin suggested further military action would be unnecessary if Kyiv negotiated with Moscow over “difficult questions”. He laid out three demands of the Ukrainian government: recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, seized in 2014; renunciation of Ukraine’s aspirations to join Nato; and partial demilitarisation. The government in Kyiv is unlikely to accept any of Putin’s ultimatums, which would involve surrendering a large swath of territory. Before Putin spoke, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, addressed the country saying: “We will give nothing away, we fear nothing and nobody.” Later he said he was introducing the conscription of reservists for a special period but ruled out a general mobilisation. “We need to promptly replenish the Ukrainian army and other military formations,” he said. “We must increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational situation.” On a visit to the Pentagon during a trip to Washington, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Putin’s aim was not about Luhansk and Donetsk but “the destruction of the Ukrainian statehood”. “We will not fall into provocations arranged by Russia,” Kuleba said. “But if the war is imposed on us by President Putin, we will be defending ourselves.” The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the crisis was “the most dangerous moment for European security in a generation”. The western sanctions are intended to deter Putin from an all-out offensive. Biden imposed bans on two Russian banks, VEB and a “military bank”, a likely reference to Promsvyazbank. The US also sanctioned the market in Russian sovereign debt, which Biden said “means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from western financing”. Starting on Wednesday, the US will target “Russia’s elites and their family members” with sanctions. EU foreign ministers agreed to sanction 27 Russians and entities, all members of the Russian Duma, the lower house of parliament, as well as banks and the defence sector, while limiting Russian access to European capital markets. The UK imposed asset freezes on five Russian banks and three wealthy Russians, but left unscathed the major UK-based oligarchs, an issue that has been a point of friction between Washington and London. Johnson said it was only “the first barrage of what we are prepared to do”. In Kyiv, there was a growing sense that Russia had decided to escalate military conflict, and the only remaining question was scale. “Unfortunately, there are more and more confirmations that such a decision by Russia is a reality. As Russia abandons diplomacy as a tool for resolving the conflict, Ukraine has no choice but to prepare to defend its territory,” said Bohdan Yaremenko, an MP and member of parliament’s foreign policy committee. After announcing new sanctions, Biden said Washington’s door remained open to diplomacy, saying: “There’s still time to avert the worst case scenario that will bring untold suffering to millions of people.”",News/World news,Likelihood of war escalates as Putin promises to support proxy Ukraine states,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/likelihood-of-war-escalates-as-putin-promises-to-support-proxy-ukraine-states
2/23/2022,"Widening sanctions against Moscow could result in higher energy bills for a swathe of UK businesses if a key Russian-owned supplier is blacklisted, the UK’s energy trade body has confirmed. Gazprom Energy, a subsidiary of Russia’s state owned gas and oil giant, has been one of the largest suppliers of gas for UK businesses since 2010, according to energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, which said the firm accounts for about 20.8% of the market.  While Downing Street has so far only imposed asset freezes on five Russian banks and three high net worth individuals as part of its retaliation over Moscow’s threat to Ukraine, the UK has given itself powers to extend those sanctions to target other key industries including the energy sector. A larger package of UK sanctions against Moscow, which is being coordinated with the US and EU, will be implemented if a full-scale invasion of Ukraine takes place. That could impact companies such as Russia’s state-owned gas giant Gazprom and subsidiaries such as Gazprom Energy, which provides gas and electricity to factories, businesses and public sector customers across the UK. According to its latest annual report, it supplied gas to 178,000 sites across the country in 2020. A subsidiary of Gazprom’s marketing and trading arm, the gas it supplies to UK customers comes from a “variety of sources and countries” including Norway and Qatar. The firm declined to confirm the proportion secured from Russia. The UK’s energy trade body has warned that any further disruption to the supply during an existing crunch could spell trouble for customers. “With both domestic and business customers already facing steep bill increases as a result of record gas prices on the wholesale market, further disruption to the market and supplies would be a big concern if it increases prices further,” a spokesperson for Energy UK said. Unlike domestic energy users, there is no price cap for business customers across the UK. Companies have suffered rising bills following a global gas supply crunch that emerged as economies began to rebound after the Covid-19 slump. Gazprom Energy first entered the UK market when it bought supplier Penine, which had just 600 customers at the time, in 2006. It did not confirm the number of UK business customers it currently serves, and declined to comment on the potential impact of UK sanctions. The gas supplier employs about 290 people at its head office in Manchester, according to its website. Its parent company is responsible for about 13% of global gas production. Although a further escalation of tensions between Russia and the west would have a far more significant impact in mainland Europe – including Germany where Russian gas imports account for 40% of the supply – it could also indirectly push up prices on the wholesale market. Economists warn this is likely to have a knock-on impact for British firms and households. Britain consumes about 74bn cubic metres of gas each year, or about 1,100 cubic metres per person, making it one of Europe’s heaviest consumers per capita. About half is imported, mostly from Norway which supplies a third of UK gas. Russia was the fourth largest market for UK gas imports in 2021 according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. Ranked after Norway, Qatar and the US, Britain bought almost £1bn of Russian gas, or about 4.9% of total UK imports. Speaking last month as tensions mounted, Will Webster, energy policy manager for the industry lobby group Oil and Gas UK, said: “If the Russians reduce deliveries of gas to Europe, then it has to come from somewhere else, most likely as shipments of liquefied natural gas. That will increase competition for supplies, driving up prices and consumer bills even more. Conversely, any additional gas we produce ourselves will help alleviate this process.” Jamie Maddock, an equity research analyst at investment management firm Quilter Cheviot said the impact of potential sanctions on the wider gas market would depend on the “severity and breadth of any sanctions beyond what’s already been announced, and then if it instils a response in Russia.” “So far, the government’s sanctions are focused on certain oligarchs within Putin’s inner circle and various Russian banks,” he said. “There is little impact on energy companies, Gazprom included, though this could well change.”",News/Business,Further sanctions against Moscow could raise energy bills for UK firms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/further-sanctions-against-moscow-could-raise-energy-bills-for-uk-businesses
2/23/2022,"Russia’s ability to fund its invasion of Ukraine through Europe’s financial markets is to be hit with a package of EU sanctions closely coordinated with the White House. As agreement was announced by the 27 European member states on a range of punitive measures against Moscow, Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, said the first strike from Brussels would “hurt Russia, and it will hurt a lot”.  EU officials said that further punitive measures could be agreed by western allies at a meeting of the G7 later this week depending on Russia’s behaviour. “We still have quite a huge package in reserve if need be,” a senior EU official said. “And that would be a political discussion with leaders across the Atlantic and with our UK friends. We have a G7 on Thursday. So that will be also discussed if we need to scale up intensity depending on the development on the grounds.” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, commended a separate decision on Tuesday by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to suspend certification of the Russian gas pipe Nord Stream 2 after much speculation about its future. She said: “We will make it as difficult as possible for the Kremlin to pursue its aggressive policies. I think the German government is absolutely right. Nord Stream 2 has to be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for the whole of Europe. Because this crisis shows that Europe is still too dependent on Russian gas. “Our action today is a response to Russia’s aggressive behaviour. If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response. The EU is united and acting fast.” After a tense 24 hours of intensive discussions, EU foreign ministers had agreed at an emergency meeting in Paris to target banks financing the military operations along with the ability of Russia to access capital by banning Russian bond trades in the European market. The EU will also block all trade from the two breakaway regions to and from the EU. It is understood that banks to be hit include Promsvyazbank and VEB.RF. Travel bans and asset seizures will also be imposed on 27 individuals and entities who played a role in “undermining Ukrainian sovereignty”, the 351 members of the Duma that voted in favour of Russia’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk and the 11 that proposed it along with the commanders of the Russian military “peacekeeping” mission. The package mirrored that planned by the US but was tougher than that presented by Boris Johnson in the House of Commons earlier in the day, with the UK threatening only to legislate to prevent Russia from issuing sovereign debt on UK markets. Officials in Brussels admitted to have been surprised that the UK had not gone harder after hawkish performances by Johnson during behind-the-scene talks in recent weeks but they insisted that there had been close coordination and that the west was united. There had been some concern voiced among some member states, particularly in the Baltic region, at the insistence of Italy, Austria and Germany on an incremental approach to sanctioning Russia. But Borrell said the EU needed to maintain leverage over Russia’s behaviour. “We are afraid that this story has not finished,” he said. An official added: “We can calibrate because you have the The Full Monty and you can calibrate depending on developments.” It is understood that cutting Russia out of the Swift financial system, which moves money from bank to bank around the world, is within the scope of a second tranche of sanctions that could be imposed. Such a move could cut Russia off from most international financial transactions, including international profits from oil and gas production, which in all account for more than 40% of the country’s revenue. “We are not contrary in principle [to further sanctions] but we believe in an incremental approach, if the escalation is growing, if the threat is growing,” said one EU diplomat from one of the more cautious member states. Hungary had been the only member state not to immediately offer full support for the list of individuals that would be hit by travel bans and asset seizures during a meeting of EU ambassadors on Tuesday morning. But Charles Michel, the European Council president, had secured the support in private of the country’s prime minster, Viktor Orbán, and unanimity was achieved over the entire package.",News/World news,Russian funding for an invasion of Ukraine will be hit by EU sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/west-struggles-to-maintain-unity-in-face-of-russia-ukraine-crisis-eu-debate
2/23/2022,"The first glimpse of a Partygate questionnaire confirms that Downing Street insiders are being questioned under police caution – and asked if they have a “reasonable excuse” for attending lockdown-busting gatherings. Boris Johnson has already returned his replies to the Metropolitan police’s questions, and is believed to have argued that he attended social events in No 10 in a work capacity.  A copy of one of the official questionnaires, obtained by ITV, shows it includes the police caution: “You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you subsequently rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.” Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “This is an embarrassment that for the first time in UK history we have a PM interviewed under police caution.” As well as asking the recipient to confirm their attendance at a specific event, the leaked questionnaire shows they were also asked: “What was the purpose of your participation in that gathering?” and “did you interact with, or undertake any activity with, other persons present at the gathering. If yes, please provide details.” Recipients were offered the opportunity to give a “lawful exception” or “reasonable excuse” for attending. Johnson is understood to have hired a lawyer to help him draw up his responses, which Downing Street has confirmed were submitted before the deadline of last Friday. Questionnaires are still being sent to some officials. The Met will then have to decide whether to impose fixed penalty notices for breaking lockdown rules. The Met investigation into 12 social events, several of which the prime minister is known to have attended, was triggered by evidence uncovered by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, whose full report on her inquiry will not be published until the police have completed their work. Johnson’s allies are convinced he has a justification for attending events that took place at No 10, which is his home as well as his workplace. He initially denied reports that parties had been held in Downing Street, telling MPs: “All guidance was followed completely.” Receiving a fixed penalty notice for breaching rules that he himself drew up is regarded as unacceptable to many backbenchers, and would be likely to prompt more letters calling for a vote of no confidence.

Well, the FTSE 100 index opened 100 points lower, which fitted the script, but it quickly rebounded and spent most of the day in positive territory. It closed up 10 points: basically flat. It was a reminder, for the umpteenth time, that stock markets are a reliably unreliable guide to geopolitics. As the fund manager Terry Smith points out often, trying to time macro events is virtually impossible since you need to know what the market was expecting and how it will react, and neither task is straightforward. Brexit and the election of President Trump were meant to shatter stock markets if they happened: share prices soared when they did.  That said, Tuesday’s mild market reaction to President Putin’s action looks little more than a holding position. The relative calm surely won’t last if Russian troops drive further into Ukraine, presumably triggering more than the “pretty tepid” sanctions, as Bill Browder, former investor in Russia and campaigner for global anti-corruption laws, described the UK response. One suspects stock markets will take their cue from energy markets in coming days and weeks. Oil briefly touched $100 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest for seven years and a price that will eat into global growth if sustained for long. Natural gas rose as Germany halted certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and conceded, in effect, that it needs to rethink a new energy policy. The fund manager Amundi’s analysts noted semi-optimistically that the former Soviet Union and Europe maintained commercial relations on energy supply even at the height of the cold war and that it is therefore “premature” to talk about an energy crisis in the EU. Yes, that assumption, which is still the market’s base case, is currently reasonable. That doesn’t mean it is guaranteed to be correct. It was polite, or canny, on the part of the big insurers to play along with the government’s spin that reform of the EU-focused Solvency II regulatory regime represents a “Brexit dividend” or a “bonfire of red-tape”. The reality is that the EU is also in reforming mode to unlock capital on insurers’ balance sheets and can be put to more useful work than sitting on piles of government IOUs. Indeed, Brussels was quicker to signal its own bonfire: its review of the rules was announced last September. Never mind the political point-scoring, though. Reform is welcome. In this technical field of “matching adjustments” and “solvency capital requirements”, a good illustration of the perverse incentives created by Solvency II was offered by the insurers’ trade body, the ABI. It calculated that this is currently much easier for a pension fund managed by an insurer “to invest in a highly rated mining company that it is to invest for 30 years in a windfarm”. It is hard to fathom how such an outcome is supposed to protect policyholders. Solvency II, which has good points, got lost in a few thickets. We have yet to see how much of the theoretical £95bn of extra investment in UK infrastructure materialises. At least part of the answer will depend on the input of the Bank of England, which presumably will be anxious to preserve a few safety-first features. But, yes, reform is a dry but important development that should boost long-term investment in the UK. Beecham – one of the names made redundant in the turn-of-the-century merger that created GlaxoSmithKline – seemed a decent ancient brand to revive for the demerger of the group’s Sensodyne-to-Panadol consumer products division. Sadly, it’s not to be. The new £50bn-ish FTSE 100 company, arriving in the summer, will be called Haleon. It sounds vaguely like an inert gas, but, according to the official explanation, the name is a marriage of hale (as in hearty) and leon (associated with strength). If you insist. At least GSK has opted for something short and inoffensive and hasn’t tried to be whizzy and digitally enabled (chief culprit: abrdn, as Standard Life Aberdeen, bizarrely, is now known). The test is how soon the outside world will stop adding an explanatory “GSK’s former consumer division” on every mention. As with the spirits group Diageo, one suspects we’ll get used to this one reasonably quickly. It’ll do.",News/Business,Talk of an EU energy crisis is premature – but nothing is guaranteed | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/22/talk-eu-energy-crisis-premature-nothing-guaranteed
2/23/2022,"Harriet Harman has called for a full investigation into how a housing association failed to realise that a tenant had apparently been left dead in her south London flat for more than two years despite repeated calls from neighbours. The body of a woman, named locally as Sheila Seleoane, 61, was found in the Peabody housing association flat in Peckham on Friday after neighbours complained about the noise of a balcony door banging during Storm Eunice.  The same neighbours said they had told staff at the housing association in the late summer or early autumn of 2019 that they were worried by the appearance of flies, maggots and a disturbing smell. They said an employee from the housing association opened corridor windows but otherwise their complaints were brushed off. “We were told that the housing association didn’t deal with flies and maggots – they said it was an issue for pest control,” said a woman who lives in the flat beneath where the woman died. Other neighbours said they tried to stop the smell coming into their flats by putting old clothes on the floor by the front door to seal the gap. “We called them many times. It’s shocking that our complaints were handled so badly,” said a neighbour whose flat stands opposite that of the dead woman. “No one listened to us.” Both residents asked not to be named. The victim has not been named formally but local media reported that she was Sheila Seleoane. Police said her death was being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. Harman, the Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham in south London, said: “You would like to think that this kind of thing wouldn’t happen in a block of flats in a busy part of London. It is shocking – awful for the neighbours and for the woman’s relatives. It raises a lot of questions for Peabody and for the police and for the council. “Peabody say they were contacted in 2020, but the neighbours say they contacted them much earlier. There is a clear discrepancy between what the housing association are saying and what the neighbours have said. We need a prompt report from Peabody and the police. What is already clear is that tenants weren’t listened to. We will establish what needs to be done to prevent this from happening again.” In a letter to local councillors, Wells Chomutare, Peabody’s assistant director of resident services for the south region, wrote: “We are fully investigating what happened. From our initial search our neighbourhood manager visited when concerns were first raised by neighbours. This was in October 2020. “When we couldn’t contact the resident we contacted the police, who reported that everything was fine. The case was then closed. We made several other attempts to call, visit and contact the resident throughout the two years.” A Peabody spokesperson said: “This is a desperately sad situation and we understand that people want answers. Our early inquiries show that we treated residents’ concerns extremely seriously when they were reported to us. We made repeated attempts to contact Ms Seleoane and called the police to raise concerns for her welfare in 2020. “Our records indicate that the police then visited the property and reported to us that our resident was safe and well. We are now working with the police and other partners to establish how this happened as part of a full investigation into all of the circumstances. We need to understand what went wrong so this can never happen again.”",News/UK news,MP calls for inquiry into failure to find dead woman in London flat,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/22/mp-calls-for-inquiry-into-failure-to-find-dead-woman-in-london-flat
2/23/2022,"The New South Wales transport minister, David Elliott, has denied he was told about a potential shutdown of the state’s rail network before going to bed on Sunday night, despite Labor brandishing a text message in parliament that appeared to contradict his claims. In a stunning backdown, one day after Elliott accused the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) of “terrorist-like activity”, the minister said on Tuesday that the government had withdrawn its application seeking an end to their industrial action in the Fair Work Commission and would negotiate with them instead.  After being completely shut down on Monday, Sydney’s trains remained on a reduced timetable on Tuesday afternoon. The RTBU said they were working on a plan to resume full services next Monday, but Elliott said he hoped a compromise could be reached sooner. In an extraordinary press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the minister insisted he was not aware in advance of the decision to shut down the network on Monday, because he went to bed while the department was still grappling with the call on Sunday night. He also said he had not informed the premier, Dominic Perrottet, of the potential for a looming shutdown because he had gone to sleep between 11pm and midnight, before the decision was made at 12.43am on Monday morning. Despite telling reporters that he had an “inkling” of what was to come, Elliott said he had not informed Perrottet “because I had no confirmation and I didn’t know exactly what action Transport for NSW would be taking”. While stating that he was “OK” that officials hadn’t called him at 12.43am when the call was made to shut down the system – “because I may not have answered the phone” – Elliott said he was “asking for information” about the decision. “We pay these people to do their job and I accept the fact that at 12.43am it was their judgment call; as executives they needed to use their discretion and close the system,” he said. “Did I like it? Absolutely not. Am I still asking for information and details to justify the decision? Absolutely.” But during question time on Tuesday the NSW Labor leader, Chris Minns, cast doubt on the minister’s version of events, reading from a text message he said was sent by Elliott’s chief of staff to a senior transport official just before 11pm on Sunday night stating the minister had been “briefed” on the situation. Speaking under parliamentary privilege, Minns said that Elliott’s chief of staff told transport officials the minister had been “briefed on the major disruption from the looming shutdown” and was “comfortable” with the decision to close the system. Responding in parliament, Elliott repeatedly said the decision to close down the network had been taken by the Sydney Trains chief executive, Matthew Longland. Elliot said there was “no way in the world” he could have been told about the closure of the network before he went to bed on Sunday because “a decision hadn’t been made until after midnight”. “Certainly this decision was made independently of me as would’ve been appropriate because I’m not an operational expert.” He challenged Labor to produce “evidence” that he had been informed of the decision to close the network. “I knew when I got up very early on Monday morning that this decision had been made and of course that the community would be inconvenienced but these decisions, as important as they are, are always made with a significant amount of communication,” he said. During his earlier press conference, Elliott said that he had yet to see a copy of a risk assessment reportedly carried out by Transport for NSW before the department made the call to shut down the network, saying he had “requested” to see it. But he also said he would have been obliged to follow the department’s advice – if he had been awake to receive it – because they were the experts on the matter. The minister’s handling of the shutdown has come under increasing scrutiny since he launched an extraordinary tirade against the rail union on Monday, accusing them of “terrorist-like activity” and “hijacking the city” over what he incorrectly labelled a “strike” action. Elliott had also claimed incorrectly that the union had failed to appear at a hearing before the commission on Sunday night. He himself had not been at the meeting, and had only arrived back in Sydney on Sunday after spending the weekend in Darwin to take part in the Veterans Ministers’ Council where he was photographed drinking a beer with prime minister Scott Morrison. In markedly more conciliatory language on Tuesday, Elliott said that the government had withdrawn its Fair Work Commission application and that he had met with the union on Tuesday and thanked Claassens after the meeting. He said his earlier comments on Monday had come “on a day of high emotion”. RTBU NSW secretary Alex Claassens said the union still wanted to see the risk assessment on which the decision allegedly hinged. He said the union’s legal team has requested it three times from the department when they were before the commission but it was never made available. “They were asked three times to produce it. They never did produce it once,” Claassens said. “This morning at 10am, our legal team sent a subpoena notice across to the other side, demanding the production of that documentation and by 11am they had a notice withdrawing the application in the commission.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Minns also called for the risk assessment used by Transport for NSW to make the decision to be made public.

2/23/2022,"After months of growing tensions, and massing troops at Ukraine’s borders, there is no doubting the gravity of this moment. The tremors are felt across Europe, which the repercussions of Russian aggression could shape for decades to come – in its east, especially, where other former Soviet republics watch anxiously, but most of all, of course, in Ukraine itself, where this is not about geopolitical struggle but the threat of a massive human disaster. Its neighbours are preparing for millions of refugees in the worst case; some Ukrainians are already fleeing, abroad or to the country’s west, though others have vowed to fight. Vladimir Putin’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent states, and order to send in “peacekeepers”, is the culmination of events which began in 2014 when Russia fomented the separatist insurgency that created the two self-proclaimed republics. Since Russian personnel have long been believed to be involved, this could be seen as to some degree a formalisation of the status quo. But in recognising the separatists’ claims to parts of the Donbas region that they do not currently control, the Russian president has increased the prospects of his armed forces encroaching on other parts of Ukraine. On Tuesday he requested the Duma to authorise the use of troops abroad; his angry railing the previous day, and the size and location of the military buildup, already suggested actions on a much larger scale.  Besides making absurd claims of “genocide” by Ukraine, Mr Putin portrayed the country as a Russian invention with no historical right to exist and, chillingly, warned that if Kyiv did not stop the violence of which Moscow accuses it, “all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine”. The best way to solve the current crisis, he has argued, is for Kyiv to abandon its goal of joining Nato and declare its neutrality. The unspoken words: or else. He has laid out his deep frustration at the Soviet Union’s collapse and desire to reestablish Russian supremacy in the region. His anger at Nato expansion comes alongside contempt for a weakened west; Brexit, domestic political divisions, the rise of China and the hope of a second Trump presidency have all, surely, factored in. Yet as Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, there is “no other way” than focusing on de-escalation efforts: restating the costs for Russia, and keeping the door open for diplomacy, however uninterested Mr Putin appears, and however unlikely it seems to succeed. His security council looked uncomfortable as members declared their backing for recognition – but they all took what was effectively a public oath of fealty. Western unity will be essential. Russia has foreign currency reserves, and is benefiting from high energy prices, while the west must decide how far it will go amid a cost of living crisis. Germany’s suspension of certification for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was both striking and welcome. But the first Nord Stream pipeline already provides two-thirds of Germany’s imported energy, and the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has declared that EU sanctions should not hit energy. Meanwhile, Britain’s sanctions are decidedly anaemic, despite Boris Johnson’s bluster, singling out five banks and three oligarchs whom the US targeted years ago: hardly the promised crackdown on kleptocracy, and weaker than the EU’s measures. Leaving further leverage is sensible, but a lacklustre response has even less chance of deterring Mr Putin if he is truly set upon a course that, as the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny warned, is likely to lead to the deaths of Russians as well as Ukrainians and cost his country dearly too.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Ukraine: the shadow of war looms larger | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/22/the-guardian-view-on-ukraine-the-shadow-of-war-looms-larger
2/23/2022,"There can be few people who don’t want to return to the happy-go-lucky days before Covid-19. It’s only human to hanker for a time when one could hug a friend or sit next to a stranger without fear of spreading a deadly disease. But the measured judgments of the government’s top scientists on Monday evening confirmed that going back to the norms of the pre-pandemic world remains some way off. Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance warned that infection rates remain high; that there are still significant numbers of people in hospital with Covid; and that a viral resurgence could “lead to [more] hospitalisations than Omicron”. This makes Boris Johnson’s decision to end all remaining Covid restrictions in England, including the legal requirement to self-isolate, baffling. Also gone by Thursday will be the self-isolation support payments of £500 for those on low incomes, and routine contact tracing. Next week Covid tests will no longer be free for most people including, bizarrely, NHS staff – which will inevitably leave vulnerable patients worried about a risk to their health. While restrictions are being relaxed in other parts of Britain, they have not been as dramatically swept away as in England.  Mr Johnson’s decision is reckless. Ending self-isolation and testing will increase infections. Perhaps his gamble is that the effect will be so small that no one will notice. The government is not following the science, but its political instincts. Mr Johnson wants the support of a handful of Tory MPs amid the ongoing partygate scandal. In return for their votes, he is prepared to throw caution – and reason – to the wind. The moves are at odds with the public mood. For all the talk of restoring “freedoms”, polls indicate only 17% think people shouldn’t legally have to isolate. Mr Johnson’s claim that he is letting people exercise “personal responsibility” hides a policy where options are limited to those who have the means. Without proper support for isolation, many will go to work ill and spread Covid. The prime minister’s exhortation that British workers should imitate their German counterparts by staying at home when feeling unwell is undermined by the fact the UK has far lower levels of statutory sick pay. His claim that “anyone who wants to can buy a test” exposes an indifference towards people who cannot afford them. Mr Johnson’s message is that the pandemic is over and life can get back to normal. This is dangerous as it undercuts a public health message, when nearly a third of adults are unvaccinated. Covid is being checked but not eliminated. To help to keep the virus under control, it would be better to ease self-isolation at a slower pace and retain free tests. Mr Johnson frames this as being too expensive, a thinly veiled attempt to panic voters about the state of the public finances. For all the suffering, Covid also revealed new possibilities. The ability of the government to spend vast sums of money demonstrated the economic power it has to address a threat deemed serious enough. The pandemic functioned as an object lesson in what is possible. Maybe it was that hope Mr Johnson feared spreading – even more than the virus.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s Covid plan: political survival is its point | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-covid-plan-political-survival-is-its-point
2/23/2022,"UK petrol prices are poised to hit a record 150p a litre later this week after the worsening tension in Ukraine added fresh pressure to the cost of living crisis facing households. Crude oil prices reached more than $99 a barrel at one point on Tuesday in response to Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Prices later slipped back after markets viewed the west’s initial sanctions response as weak.  But with Brent crude ending the day 1.6% higher at just under $97 a barrel, the RAC said motorists would quickly be paying 150p a litre for unleaded petrol and 154p a litre for diesel. Analysts said the cost of crude – already at its highest level in seven years – was soon likely to push through the $100-a-barrel level. Jeremy Nicholson, corporate affairs officer at Alfa Energy Group, said: “The deterioration of the situation in Ukraine and threat of military action by Russia is adding to the risk of disruption to European gas supplies, putting further pressure on UK/European wholesale gas and power prices. Oil prices are also being affected, with growing expectation oil could shortly reach or exceed $100 a barrel.” Germany’s decision to withhold approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline drew a swift response from Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council. “Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay €2,000 () per thousand cubic metres!” he tweeted – suggesting prices were set to double. On a rollercoaster day, stock markets in Europe took their initial cue from Asia, which suffered big falls overnight after Russia sent troops into Donetsk and Luhansk. Share prices later recouped most of their losses in London, Frankfurt and Paris after the UK imposed sanctions on five of the smaller Russian banks and on three individuals already targeted by the US. But the risks of further turbulence on the global markets increased when the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance believed Russia was planning a bigger assault on Ukraine. Western leaders in London, Washington and Brussels warned they would scale up their response if there was an intensification of Russia’s military action. Responding to all-party criticism, Britain said it would be scaling up its response while the EU and the US also pledged to put strong economic pressure on Moscow. The UK’s Centre for Economic and Business Research thinktank warned the crisis in Ukraine threatened to deliver a double blow of higher inflation and weaker growth. “Any international action will likely not only add to the current inflationary binge, possibly bringing inflation close to 10% in the main western economies, but also should slow down growth quite rapidly,” it said. The UK annual inflation rate – as measured by the consumer prices index – currently stands at 5.5% but is forecast by the Bank of England to rise above 7% by the spring. In London, the FTSE 100 index in London closed marginally higher at 7,495.97. Germany’s Dax lost 0.4% while France’s CAC slipped 0.16%, and Italy’s FTSE MiB and Spain’s Ibex were flat. Russian stock markets also staged a small comeback after earlier losses, with the dollar-denominated RTS index and the rouble-denominated Moex index on the Moscow exchange both rising 1.6% this afternoon. Shares in Russia’s largest lender Sberbank rose 1.3% (after an earlier gain of 5%) while the second-biggest bank VTB was up 1.7%, after they escaped British sanctions. Russ Mould, investment director at the investment firm AJ Bell, said: “Moscow’s RTS index was down 3% before Olaf Scholz and Mr Johnson made their statements – and it ended the day 1.6% higher. Major gainers included Gazprom, Norilsk Nickel, Tatneft and Rusal.”",News/Business,"UK petrol prices poised to hit record 150p a litre soon, warns RAC",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/uk-petrol-prices-poised-to-hit-record-150p-a-litre-soon-warns-rac
2/23/2022,"Athletes at the Commonwealth Games this year will be allowed to raise a fist on the podium to protest in favour of racial equality, and wave Pride flags in support of LGBT+ rights during victory laps, the Guardian has learned. The 4,500 athletes expected in Birmingham this summer will also be permitted to wear clothing, armbands and badges on the podium to support social justice causes under radical new “guiding principles” for athlete advocacy due to be announced on Tuesday.  But while the move will delight many athletes and human rights campaigners, insiders are also expecting a backlash from some commentators, who may try to rebrand the event as the “Common-woke Games”. The decision to allow athletes to raise a fist on the podium in support of Black Lives Matter is particularly evocative, as it will bring back memories of Mexico 1968, when Tommie Smith and John Carlos used a black power salute on the Olympic podium to protest against racial injustice in America. Within 48 hours of their protest both men were kicked out of those Games at the urging of the International Olympic Committee president, Avery Brundage – and, even now, the IOC forbids athletes from any kind of protest or demonstration on the podium, field of play, or during ceremonies. However senior figures at the Commonwealth Games Federation believe that a more enlightened policy is now needed. The hope is that by allowing more freedom of expression in Birmingham it will allow athletes to better become – in the words of one source – “agents for change in improving the world for the better”. It is also expected that the CGF will argue that strengthening athlete advocacy and activism humanises, rather than politicises, sport – a view very different to that taken by the IOC. Another notable change for Birmingham 2022 is that Aboriginal flags will be allowed on victory laps – a decision that stirs images of the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria when the Australian Cathy Freeman proudly held the flags of both her country and her people over her head, after winning the 400m. At the time such a celebration was not permitted and Freeman was publicly reprimanded by Australia’s chef de mission for the Games, Arthur Tunstall, who said: “She should have carried the Australian flag first up, and [we should have] not seen the Aboriginal flag at all.” Allowing Pride flags may also prove to be controversial in some nations given homosexuality is still illegal in 36 of the 72 countries that will compete in Birmingham. However the move is likely to be warmly endorsed by Tom Daley, who has regularly used his platform to suggest that the Commonwealth should be doing more to support LGBT rights. Speaking after winning gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia’s Gold Coast – when homosexuality was illegal in 37 of the countries taking part – the British diver said: “You want to feel comfortable in who you are when you are standing on that diving board and for 37 Commonwealth countries that are here participating that is not the case. “I feel with the Commonwealth, we can really help push some of the other nations to relax their laws on anti-gay stuff.” Under the new guidelines athletes will be reminded that protests will be subject to the CGF ‘Charter of Good Conduct’ and must be done in “a tolerant and positive way”. Athletes will also be told that protests against a person, country or organisation – as well as actions such as defacing a national flag on the podium, hate speech, and making hand gestures affiliated with hate groups – are still forbidden.",Sport/Sport,Athletes permitted to protest on the podium at Commonwealth Games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/22/athletes-permitted-to-protest-on-the-podium-at-commonwealth-games
2/23/2022,"Sarina Wiegman has urged England to be more “ruthless” in the final game of the Arnold Clark Cup against Germany on Wednesday. The Lionesses are second in the four-team friendly tournament, level on two points with Spain. Canada top the standings having beaten Germany after a 1-1 draw with England.  Wiegman brushed aside concerns about the team’s lack of goals from the front, with the centre-back Millie Bright’s volley England’s only goal of the competition, but she conceded they do need to be more clinical. “It doesn’t really matter who scored the goals as long as we score a goal,” the manager said. “We want to do better in the final third and that’s about decision-making, about connection, about scanning the situation and then being ruthless. “So yes, of course, we want to do a little better because we created lots of chances. We played really well, created those chances and now we want to score them, too, and that’s just the final touch, the hardest thing.” Germany are the highest-ranked team in the competition, at third in the world, but are missing key players, including Wolfsburg’s Almuth Schult, Svenja Huth, Alex Popp and Tabea Waßmuth and Olympique Lyonnais’s Dzsenifer Marozsán. “They still have a very strong squad,” Wiegman said. “They are always a very good team and, even though they are missing very good players ,they still have very good players. We expect a good Germany, a very competitive game with a lot of speed and power, so we’ll be prepared like we were for Canada and Spain.” Wiegman rotated heavily between England’s 1-1 draw with Canada and 0-0 against Spain, making nine changes, and she confirmed she would continue to experiment. “We want to continue what we were doing but make that even better against another good opponent again. We want to see some slight changes in positions.” Wiegman has been impressed with how the squad has held up against the toughest challenges faced during her tenure. “I’ve seen a lot from us and the team. When I came in I knew the England squad was very good but it’s even better than I thought. “The players already have so much experience and there are lots of personalities within the team.

2/23/2022,"The veteran Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov certainly had not been authorised to declare war on Ukraine in his daily press briefing on Tuesday, but he was coming perilously close to doing so anyway. He could not explain if Russia had recognised the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk up to their current borders, or with claims on further Ukrainian land. The answer could be the difference between a stalemate and a Russian war of conquest. And, not knowing that Vladimir Putin would weigh that evening to settle the question in favour of the expanded borders, Peskov was making a hash of it.  “Do these borders include Mariupol,” a journalist asked. “I have nothing to add,” replied Peskov, who had already delivered his one-line talking point: “Within the borders in which they exist and have been proclaimed.” “Meaning within the current borders?” another journalist ventured, hoping that the sixth question on the topic might lead to a breakthrough. “I have nothing to add to this,” Peskov replied. And on it went. Putin signed a presidential order to recognise the territories’ independence on Monday but it only became clear on Tuesday evening that Putin would back the territories’ claims to nearly three times the area currently under their control, making an offensive in east Ukraine a distinct possibility in the near future. For nearly a day, officials were treading water. A deputy prime minister said Russia had recognised the current borders where the states “operate and have jurisdiction.” An MP contradicted him, saying it should be the expanded borders, then contradicted himself, saying he was just expressing his personal opinion. It is possible that Putin only made up his mind later on Tuesday, after he gauged the reactions from the west to what some called his “re-invasion” of east Ukraine. Analysts who spent Tuesday waiting for Putin’s decision on the issue said that backing the territorial claims could “definitely mean a war”. “In Moscow, the open question is what particular borders they’re going to defend,” said Andrei Kortunov, the director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a thinktank, noting the territorial claims could be a justification for war. But while Putin could remain sphinx-like on the question for much of Tuesday, other officials were forced to run the gauntlet in public, stumbling over themselves to avoid making policy for the Kremlin. Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, went on state television late in the afternoon to discuss an official treaty he had just signed with Putin on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance. “I want to get to the bottom of this question,” the anchor asked in an unusually insistent interview for Russian state TV. “When the agreement was signed between Russia and the [Donetsk People’s Republic], Russia took on an obligation to defend the borders of the republic in the whole Donetsk region, is that correct?” Pushilin sighed. He’d already dodged the question twice. “I’ll tell you that the question was not discussed,” he admitted a bit sheepishly. While normally you would expect a state signing a similar treaty to recognise the others’ territorial claims, he added: “We shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves.” When Putin finally chimed in later on, he made it sound as though the answer had always been obvious. “We have recognised the independence of these republics,” he said, noting that included their constitutions, which had the borders “within the Donetsk and Luhansk regions at the time when they were part of Ukraine”. The simple statement could have explosive consequences.",News/World news,A day of dodging questions over Russian-controlled territories,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/russia-day-of-dodging-questions-over-russian-controlled-territories

Farmers from England and Wales gathered in Birmingham on Tuesday, against the backdrop of huge upheaval in agriculture, with labour shortages caused by Brexit and Covid, an ongoing pig cull and the transition to life beyond the EU’s subsidy scheme.  The day opened with a blistering attack on ministers from the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, who accused the government of having no post-Brexit plan and of showing a “total lack of understanding of how food production works.” Her views were echoed by farmers speaking from the floor of the conference. Sam Godfrey, a pig farmer from Lincolnshire, said it was the “toughest time” he had known in 14 years on the family farm, while his father said he had not seen such challenging conditions since the 1970s. Godfrey, who has a herd of 6,500 sows, said pigs were still backing up on their farm, as abattoirs continued to take fewer animals to slaughter each week than planned. This is despite the family having invested £50,000 in converting buildings into extra space to house their pigs. “We have some spare capacity,” Godfrey said. “But we have never had a situation where it was this prolonged.” The NFU estimates that 200,000 pigs are backed up on farms in England, and are unable to be taken to slaughter as a result of labour shortages at abattoirs. Meanwhile, 40,000 healthy animals are thought to have been culled, and have not entered the food chain. Batters told the conference she had received a “heart-breaking” email from a family, who did not want to share their name, who had been producing pigs for more than 50 years. “They have taken the decision to cull 4,700 sows,” she said. Their son had hoped to enter the family business after completing an agriculture degree but had been forced to find another job. The government recently announced an immediate review of fairness in the pig industry supply chain and extended measures to support pig producers, including permitting foreign butchers to travel to the UK on temporary visas, longer working hours at processing plants and a scheme allowing producers to store carcasses for several months before processing. However, ministers have stopped short of providing financial support to affected pig farmers, in contrast with Scotland, Northern Ireland and some EU countries. One agricultural company, Thanet Earth, which grows tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers in glasshouses in Kent, said it had lost £320,000-worth of produce in 2021, when crops could not be picked at the right time to sell to its primary customers. “Some of it went to charity, but it hits us as a loss because it is a low-margin industry,” said Robert James, technical director of Thanet Earth. “The impact of not having access to labour.” Others warn that some smaller growers may leave the industry if they are unable to get enough workers to pick their crops. “We don’t know until we get into the summer whether we will get the workers we need,” said Philip Pearson, group development director at APS Produce, the UK’s largest tomato grower. The company requires 1,000 seasonal workers each year. “What this is going to mean is more imported food.” Producers say post-Brexit visa quotas are holding them back. The government has kept the number of seasonal worker permits at the 30,000 people allowed in 2021, resisting calls for a significant increase.",News/Business,Farmers in England and Wales ‘face toughest times in a generation’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/22/farmers-toughest-times-generation-england-wales-
