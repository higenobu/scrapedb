4/2/2022,"Environmental protesters have continued to block UK oil terminals as part of a campaign to disrupt the fossil fuel industry despite dozens of arrests across the country. Supporters of Just Stop Oil began the action in the early hours of Friday morning at refineries near London, Birmingham and Southampton by climbing on to tankers and gluing themselves to roads. Despite at least 34 arrests, the activists continued to disrupt oil terminals on Saturday morning and said they had gained access to further sites. The group announced on social media that they had blocked Navigator terminals in Essex, posting photos of protesters in hi-vis jackets on top of a tanker and other blocking a road with a banner reading “Just Stop Oil”. They said protesters had blocked access to the Titan Truck Park and revealed a secret underground network of tunnels leading to the site. The development means the main and emergency access roads to the critical oil terminals are closed. “We need the government to stop funding new oil projects and we need it now! Our only means of highlighting this issue is mass civil resistance,” they said in a post on Instagram. BREAKINGThe morning brings new blocks!

Click the link in our bio to find out more.#JustStopOil #Endfossilfuels pic.twitter.com/VTAlGi0mCJ The group is demanding the government ends the expansion of new oil and gas projects. Just Stop Oil said this week’s campaign has seen them transition from using tactics of civil disobedience to exercising civil resistance. Explaining what this shift would look like, one supporter told the Guardian last month that it would mean “stopping pointing out what the government should or shouldn’t be doing [and instead] actively stopping government doing what they shouldn’t be”. The campaign, which has seen protesters glued to roads, suspended on bamboo tripods, and locked on to oil drums and each other, is taking place in defiance of a temporary high court injunction banning protests outside oil terminals. Outside Kingsbury and on roads leading to the site, posters said: “Temporary high court injunction in force. Blocking, slowing down, obstructing or interfering with traffic on to this road as part of protest activity by Just Stop Oil, Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain movements and other connected movements is strictly prohibited. Failure to comply with the injunction may lead to imprisonment.” As a result of the blockades, oil pipeline distribution network ExxonMobil UK closed down three of its terminals. Police from at least five forces were deployed to deal with the protests, making arrests for offences including aggravated trespass, criminal damage and obstructing the highway.",News/Environment,Protesters continue to block UK oil terminals despite arrests,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/02/protesters-continue-block-uk-terminals-arrests-just-stop-oil
4/2/2022,"As the trial against the accused Islamic State fighter El Shafee Elsheikh began this week on American soil, jurors in a northern Virginia courtroom were quickly exposed to accounts of unimaginable brutality. Elsheikh, prosecutors alleged, carried out terrorist acts that involved the grisly deaths of four Americans – the journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, as well as the aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. Elsheikh, a British national, allegedly did so as part of a three-man cell dubbed “the Beatles” by the group’s hostages, due to their English accents. Officials have said that this cell was responsible for the kidnappings of more than 20 westerners between 2012 and 2015. IS members decapitated Foley, Kassig, and Sotloff. The leader of IS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, repeatedly raped Mueller before she was killed. Legal experts told the Guardian that Elsheikh’s trial would help provide a sense of justice to victims’ families and show that international terrorism cases can, and should, be held in US civilian courts – an important precedent. David Viola, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice’s Center on Terrorism, said Elsheikh’s trial demonstrated that the US could get justice through the legal process, not solely by relying on military force. “The trial proves to the world, hostage-takers, terrorists, and others that the US has a virtually unlimited reach and a very long memory,” Viola said. The prosecutor John Gibbs described Elsheikh as an IS leader who relished cruelty. Elsheikh and his accomplices had beaten hostages more frequently than did low-level guards, Gibbs said on Wednesday in his opening statement. “If a hostage looked at any of the three men, they would be beaten,” said Gibbs. “In fact, they did not have to do anything to be beaten.” Hostages who were poised to be released after paying ransoms even endured “going-away beatings”, Gibbs said, noting that Elsheikh and his accomplices once struck a hostage 25 times when they learned it was his 25th birthday, the Associated Press reported. The IS fighters “were utterly terrifying” to hostages, Gibbs said. Hostages had to kneel, face the wall and avoid eye contact with their captors. Federico Motka, an aid worker, said that he and his fellow aid worker David Haines were forced to fight captured journalists, including Foley and John Cantlie. “They were super excited about it,” Motka, who was held captive for 14 months and released in May 2014, testified. “We were so weak and shattered we could barely lift our arms.” The cell described these forced fights as a “royal rumble”, Motka said. They further humiliated the hostages by giving mock commentary on these forced fights. They were forced to fight until passing out. “They played lots of games with us,” Motka told jurors. “They gave us dog names. We needed to come and immediately respond.” Motka claimed that in late 2013 and early 2014, hostages had to wear orange jumpsuits, with their captors saying they wanted to re-create “conditions to the detainees at Guantánamo Bay”. Motka said that he endured waterboarding and electrocution through an opening in his cell “until my hands went rigid”. Elsheikh and another Briton, Alexanda Amon Kotey, were caught in January 2018 by Kurdish fighters while trying to escape from Syria to Turkey. They were brought to US authorities in Iraq and eventually transported to Virginia in 2020, for criminal proceedings. British officials stripped Elsheikh and Kotey of their UK citizenship but delayed their transfer to the US until authorities agreed not to pursue the death penalty against them. Kotey pleaded guilty in September 2021 and is awaiting sentencing. His plea deal stipulates life imprisonment; after 15 years, however, he could serve the rest of his sentence in the UK if authorities there are willing to accept him. The cell ringleader, Mohammed Emwazi, known as “Jihadi John”, died during a US drone strike in Syria about seven years ago. Elsheikh’s attorney, Edward MacMahon, has contended that there is no evidence proving he was in the terror cell. MacMahon conceded that Elsheikh had traveled to Syria to fight in IS but said cell members always worke masks, making it difficult to identify them. But amid the awful to and fro in the court room and the details of cruelty, violence and death, experts believe the trial’s legacy will concern far bigger issues than individual violence. “We’re a nation of laws. Our power and our legitimacy can never solely be derived from our military might,” said Viola, who has served as an intelligence officer in the US navy reserve. “We have to hold the likes of Elsheikh accountable … in front of a judge and jury.” Viola continued: “This is the kind of proof we need for the world, and for ourselves, that laws can have a more profound and lasting impact, and importantly, bring closure to the families of the men and women who died.” Jason M Blazakis, director of the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said Elsheikh’s trial showed that the US would prosecute more of this type of case. “I think the trial, in and of itself, demonstrates that the United States is serious about ensuring that the law is applied against individuals engaged in hostage taking – no matter how long it’s been between the actual hostage taking and the actual trial itself,” Blazakis said. “There is no statute essentially of limitations in terms of trying to bring people to justice for the horrible crimes they allegedly committed.” In Blazakis’s view, these proceedings might send a message to people who are considering similar actions and prevent some from doing so. “There are always going to be individuals who sacrifice themselves for some ideological objective – those types of individuals are not going to spend a lot of time thinking about this court case,” Blazakis said. “But there are other kinds of bad actors who are less steeped in the religious ideological milieu of Isis who could be deterred.” Trial testimony resumes next week.

4/2/2022,"Gorgeous Greece has always been a classic, go-to summer holiday destination, and the pandemic served as a stark reminder that tourism is the main motor driving the economy. As a result, many new initiatives were rushed through: from improving infrastructure and promoting sustainability to developing lesser-known destinations. Early projections suggest that these measures have succeeded and, if all goes well, 2022 could be a bumper season, with tourism reaching 80-90% of pre-Covid levels. So maybe this is the year to discover an out-of-the-way beach or an underrated resort, to recharge those sun-depleted batteries far from the madding holiday-deprived crowds, or to embark on a scenic mountain trek. For trips to the islands, ferry timetables change from week to week, so it’s best to book tickets one to two days in advance using an agent such as First Choice Travel, which has the latest dates and times. The pine-clad island of Alonissos in the north Aegean – overshadowed by its better-known neighbours Skopelos and Skiathos – was catapulted into international consciousness in 1992 through the establishment of the Alonissos national marine park, the first in Greece and still the largest protected marine area in Europe. Its waters shelter the critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal, plus dolphins, whales and rare seabirds. There are daily boat trips to the park’s 28 islands and outcrops, during which passengers can swim from the beach of Kyra Panagia island, which, intriguingly, belongs to Mount Athos. Its monastery of the Virgin Mary is open to the public and inhabited by two monks, one of whom, Father Chariton, was previously a chef in Camden Town, London. The latest novelty is the first-ever Greek underwater museum, a perfectly preserved shipwreck dating from 425BC, which lies on the seabed beside the island of Peristera. The ship carried 4,000 amphorae, or wine urns, that can still be seen by recreational scuba divers who come with a guide – unusually, as other similar wrecks in Greece are off-limits for fear of theft. Non-divers can explore the shipwreck virtually via the museum website. Eye-catching marine parks and shipwrecks aside, Alonissos is really about forested treks, relaxing swims and dozy unfussiness. There are only two settlements: the tranquil capital, Chora, and the small, busy port of Patitiri, where most of the hotels cluster. The roads to the beaches are surprisingly good. Leftos Gialos has sun loungers and two beach bars; at Kokkinokastro, turquoise waters reflect a dramatic red promontory; Megalos Mourtias has grand views towards Skopelos; and from Chrissi Milia, the most accessible beach, a footpath leads over the headland to Milia for a more secluded sunbathe. Where to stayHotel Yalis (doubles from €75 B&B) above Patitiri has a great swimming pool and bar, as well as an excellent breakfast buffet, while the brightly furnished Atrium Alonissos (doubles from €80 B&B) nearby delivers views over the Rousoum Gialos beach and is competitive on comfort and facilities. Where to eatThe best places are in Chora: the stylish menu of Thea features pork fillet in a red dessert wine sauce with mushrooms and sweet potatoes; vine-draped Astrofegia, occupying a stone mansion, is a traditional romantic taverna; and bubbly cafe-cum-piano-bar Hayati, with a panoramic terrace, supplies live entertainment in high season. How to get thereAlonissos is reached by ferry from the port of Volos in mainland Greece (five-hour crossing), from Skiathos (two hours) and, in season, from Thessaloniki (4½ hours). The quickest way from Athens is via ferry from Mantoudi (two hours) on the huge island of Evia, which is linked by bridge to the mainland, and two hours’ drive from the capital. Only three hours by ferry from Athens’ Piraeus harbour, yet 30 years behind in temperament, Kythnos, with its off-grid simplicity and numerous unspoilt beaches, will awaken the inner hedonist in even the most cynical of tourists. This island still feels like Greece as it used to be: it didn’t have a credit card network until six years ago, and rented sunbeds and umbrellas have yet to arrive on its beaches. Merihas, the sleepy arrival port, is not flush with accommodation options, but there are plenty at the genteel resort of Loutra, whose thermal springs were acclaimed by Greece’s King Otto in the 19th century. There are plans under way to upgrade the original neoclassical thermal complex into a modern spa as part of a new hotel project, but for now visitors can still enjoy the rush of warm groundwater for free by soaking in a natural “bathtub” rock formation on the right-hand side of the beach. There’s also great swimming from the head-swivellingly spectacular sandy spit of Kolona, which joins the island with the small islet of St Luke; a hiking trail to Kastro tis Orias, the Byzantine medieval capital, five miles north-west of Loutra; and briny breezes under the tamarisks on the shaded beach of Kanala in the far south-east, also home to the Church of Panagia Kanala, one of the most important pilgrimage sites in the Cyclades. Where to stay In the centre of the action at Loutra, Porto Klaras hotel (self-catering doubles from €100 a night) is a designer option. The convivial Villa Elena (doubles from €60 room-only, two-night minimum)above Martinakia beach is 10 minutes’ walk from Merihas. Where to eatYachting club Sofrano at Loutra is a typical Greek meat-and-fish grill, while Margiora in Chora, the capital, has a more sophisticated bistro vibe and an impressive wine list. Islanders frequent the unassuming taverna To Kantouni on the Merihas waterfront for its kebabs and sfougato (local cheese croquettes). There’s a whiff of nightlife in Chora: cafe/bar Apocalipsi has occasional live music, and the Kraken is a night owls’ haunt, where punch-packing cocktails start at €9. How to get thereThere are frequent ferries from Piraeus (three-hour voyage), although the quickest way to Kythnos is from the port of Lavrio (1½-hour crossing), about an hour’s drive south-east of central Athens. Bang in the middle of the Aegean, this butterfly-shaped island belongs politically to the Italianate Dodecanese, but it forms a cultural bridge with the Cyclades. Not only is it more whitewashed than the popular neighbouring islands of Rhodes and Kos, but its eight photogenic windmills also evoke the aesthetic of Mykonos. On the other hand, the 13th-century citadel in the capital, Chora, is unquestionably Venetian and, as a former part of Mussolini’s Mediterranean Empire, Astypalea has incorporated risottos and pasta – such as makarounes, a homemade, thick spaghetti – into its cuisine. The island is thinking progressively in terms of sustainability. In partnership with Volkswagen, the Chora municipality has pledged to electrify its municipal fleet (buses, fire engines, police vehicles) from this year, and is planning to extend the scheme to rental cars and private vehicles via substantial discounts. Twelve charging points have been erected, with more to come (Athens only has 26). As Astypalea is the last stop on every ferry route, the beaches are always uncrowded, and package tours are nonexistent. Vatses and Kaminakia, reached by dirt roads, are sandy, wide and safe; the sea at shaded Livadi is sparkling as it comes, while the caramel cove of Agios Konstantinos is served by a good taverna. The eastern “wing” is home to wild, solitary sweeps of sand, such as Plakes and Vathy. Where to stay Pylaia Boutique Hotel & Spa (doubles from €98 B&B), on a slope overlooking Chora, is a designer’s dream, similar in style to the kind found in Santorini. Closer to town is the classy, adults-only Chrysalis Boutique hotel (doubles, all with sea views, from €60 B&B). Where to eatSun-bleached taverna Agoni Grammi at Chora serves inexpensive, delicious fare, including Italian-Astypalean fusion specialities such as clam risotto. For a splash-out dinner, Akti offers fine dining including fish meatballs, octopus sautéed in ouzo and lobster linguine. How to get thereThe ferry from Piraeus takes 10 hours, but a new, fast catamaran service which started last summer takes 5½ hours from Rhodes and 1¾ hours from Kos Most Greeks would struggle to find Gialova on a map. The small holiday village in the south-western Peloponnese is a few miles south of the Costa Navarino mega resort – which does get a flash of recognition – and shares the same coast and regional attractions, but at a fraction of the cost. Gialova ticks all the boxes. It’s walking distance from the Gialova lagoon and nature reserve, one of the prime bird habitats in Greece, where specialist guides offer birdwatching tours. The reserve is also home to the only European colony of the fiercely protected African chameleon. In the other direction is ancient Pylos, where excavations have unveiled a large Mycenaean-era palace, popularly named Nestor’s Palace after the local king in the Iliad. The site is imaginatively laid out with raised visitor walkways that allow a thorough exploration. Modern Pylos is an unpretentious port overlooked by Niokastro (New Castle), an impressive 16th-century hexagonal fort with striking views. To top it all, just the other side of the nature reserve is the perfect, quasi-circular curve of Voïdokoilia, one of Greece’s most gorgeous beaches, which is backed by sand dunes. The bird’s eye view of it from the ruins of Paleokastro (Old Castle) more than compensates for the necessary hour’s stiff climb up. Where to stayFamily-owned and pleasingly old-fashioned, though with smart rooms, Zoe Resort (doubles from €120 B&B) is beside a wide beach shaded by mulberry and plane trees. In late August and September lovelorn chameleons hop about looking for a mate in its gardens, and there’s a pool. Nearby Erodios is a comfortable family campsite with bungalows (doubles from €55 a night). Where to eatRural nostalgia rules in Gialova: the Natura, Zoe’s restaurant, is a vintage taverna easily accessed from the beach, where guests can inspect the day’s dishes in the kitchen. Further on, Spitiko is a Cypriot restaurant sought after for its seftalia meatballs. How to get thereThe extension of the highway from the city of Kalamata has cut driving time to less than an hour. Kalamata is around a 2¾-hour drive south-west from Athens. The capital of the north-west mainland region of Epirus, facing the Pindus mountain range on the banks of Lake Pamvotis, Ioanninna is a chief contender for Greece’s prettiest non-coastal town. It achieved prominence in the early 1800s under the rule of the notorious Ali Pasha, who made a lasting impression on Lord Byron. Although 2022 marks 200 years since his death while fighting Sultan Mahmud II, his spirit never abandoned the town. The current fortress was restored during his reign and the mosques he worshipped in, the palace he built and his tomb are all city landmarks. As a result, Ioannina radiates more of a feeling of Ottoman past than any other town in Greece. A 19-mile tour of the lake by bike offers views of the town and the mountains. A second day could be spent at the island on the lake, reached by passenger boat, with its fishing village, Ali Pasha Museum and seven Byzantine monasteries. A 40-minute drive away is Metsovo, Greece’s mountain capital, bordering Pindos national park. In the winter it’s a ski resort; in summer it’s a hub for adrenaline junkies, with mountain biking, hiking, canyoning, kayaking and rafting on the River Aöos. As the birthplace of two of Greece’s major philanthropists, George Averoff and Michael Tositsas, who built universities, hospitals and more, it has a remarkable cultural heritage, punctuated by the Averoff Gallery of Greek Painting and the Tositsa Museum of Folk Art. Where to stayHotel du Lac (doubles from €120 B&B) is atmospherically sited by the waterside. For more of a town buzz, Kamares (doubles from €120 B&B) is a boutique renovation of an 18th-century mansion. For an unforgettable experience, the Grand Forest Metsovo (doubles from €160 B&B) is an alpine-style grande dame that sits on a private hill overlooking Metsovo, surrounded by beech and black-pine forest. Where to eatThe clutch of tavernas on the island offer typical lake dishes: frogs’ legs, stone-baked eel, carp in tomato sauce, and crayfish with garlic and walnuts. Frontzou Politia in town provides mountain fare, such as vegetable and cheese pies, mutton with feta cheese, and goat shank. How to get thereIoannina is pretty accessible: it’s one hour by car from Igoumenitsa, terminus of ferries from Italy, or an easy 4½-hour drive from Athens, while the new Egnatia motorway has cut the driving time from Thessaloniki to just three hours. The Athos region in eastern Halkidiki is best known for the Holy Mountain and its monks’ republic, but the monastic administration covers only two-thirds of the peninsula. The rest is an amalgamation of dozens of semi-deserted beaches, lush hikes, archaeological sites such as Stagira, birthplace of Aristotle, and peaceful seaside towns including Ierissos and Olymbiada. The lodestar of attractions is, of course, Mount Athos, which can be circumnavigated by boat, and its administrative centre of Ouranoupoli, with its icon galleries, but another showstopper is Ammouliani, a pinch-me island of pristine beaches. Here Alykes, a wide bay with sand the colour and consistency of milled oats, is one of Greece’s best-kept secrets, while many find the translucent shallows of Megali Ammos, one mile east, even more enticing. Snorkellers can book excursions to the crystalline waters of the rocky Drenia archipelago. Hikers should attempt at least part of the meandering 18-mile Aristotelian Walk (according to legend, he was a great walker), a well-signposted, shaded woodland trail from New to Ancient Stagira . Where to stay The sumptuous Eagles Palace (doubles from €134 B&B, three- night minimum) is a five-star beach resort whose six restaurants render its premium half-board option very attractive (from €48 adult). For a lower-key vibe, Hotel Liotopi (doubles from €99 half-board) is a friendly family-run hotel at Olymbiada, and a far cry from other crowded Halikdiki resorts. Where to eatThe Athos region takes pride in its Aegean seafood, but because of the stream of pilgrims and the monks’ influence, there are vegan dishes served in just about every taverna. Kamares, at the aforementioned Eagles Palace hotel, is curated by chef Arnaud Bignon, owner of the two-Michelin starred Spondi in Athens, so dinner here is a must. For imaginative seafood, try the spicy mussel stew at Akroyiali in Olympiada and the sea bass ceviche at Kokkinos in Ouranoupoli. How to get thereOuranoupoli is an easy 1½ hours’ drive east of Thessaloniki. ",Lifestyle/Travel,Hidden Greece: where to stay and what to do away from the beaten track,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/02/hidden-greece-where-to-stay-and-what-to-do-away-from-the-beaten-track
4/2/2022,"On the whiteboard in Christian Wakeford’s Westminster office there is a to-do list detailing everything he needs to achieve in the week ahead. Alongside the domestic (laundry) and the aspirational (secure a Westminster Hall debate on pure maths), one entry stands out: “Learn words to Red Flag.” On 19 January, Wakeford delivered a dramatic shock to Boris Johnson’s government. By walking into prime minister’s questions in a union jack face mask and taking a seat behind Keir Starmer, he became the first Tory MP for 15 years to switch to Labour. It was a moment that blindsided even his closest friends in the Conservative party. To leave the governing party for the opposition was a particularly bold move: the last two Tory defectors, Quentin Davies in 2007 and Shaun Woodward in 1999, both joined Labour when it was in power. Today, Wakeford insists he is not really swotting up on the Labour party anthem and blames Ben Everitt, the prank-loving Conservative MP for Milton Keynes North, for sneaking into his office. Earlier that morning, Everitt bowled up to Wakeford and gave him a hug bordering on a rugby tackle. It is seven weeks after Wakeford’s defection, and at least some former colleagues are starting to forgive his treachery. Everitt is also accused of leaving the can of C Bomb pale ale on the desk, a nod to Wakeford’s reputation as one of parliament’s foulest mouths. On the bookshelf, next to a Lego model of Boba Fett from Star Wars, are two bottles of sauvignon blanc scrawled with Boris Johnson’s signature, intended as raffle prizes for constituency party events at which he is now almost certainly unwelcome. By his computer is an unused red Labour mug. It sits on a David Shrigley coaster that reads: “I’m so hungover I wish I was dead.” It was no secret that Wakeford was unhappy in the Conservative party. Elected as MP for Bury South in 2019, with a majority of just 402, Wakeford was openly critical of Boris Johnson over the “partygate” scandal, and earlier this year revealed he had submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. “How do you defend the indefensible? You can’t!” he tweeted on 12 January. The 37-year-old already had a reputation for bluntness; last November, he marched up to Owen Paterson and called him a “fucking selfish cunt” after the government instructed its MPs to vote to overhaul the parliamentary standards system in an attempt to save Paterson’s skin (ultimately the government was forced into a U-turn). If he’d resigned the Conservative whip and sat as an independent, few would have been surprised. But for this leave-voting, lockdown-sceptic Tory lifer to join Labour? No one saw that coming. He didn’t seek counsel from anyone in the party he had joined aged 18. His staffers, who included two Tory councillors, were kept in the dark. He didn’t even tell his wife, Alex, until the morning of his defection (her reaction: “Oh shit”). Many Labour MPs hardly noticed Wakeford during his first two years in parliament and had to Google their new comrade. He had been on the education select committee, but didn’t turn up for meetings half the time, and did not have a reputation for cross-party collegiality. Indeed, after his defection it emerged that he had sent a message to a Tory WhatsApp group calling Labour a “bunch of cunts”. You can see how he earned that can of C Bomb. Even as the Guardian’s North of England editor, I had only the vaguest sense of Wakeford. After the 2019 general election, he was among a minority of new Tory MPs who would at least occasionally take my calls, but Covid meant we had never actually met. I interviewed him on the phone in December 2020, and he was open about how hard he was finding the job. He complained that he hardly ever got to see his two-year-old daughter, and there had been protests outside his office after he abstained on the Marcus Rashford-inspired vote on free school meals. “Is there anything good about being an MP?” he mused. “I’ll let you know when Covid finishes.” A month after his defection, we met for an off-the-record drink in Manchester that turned into five pints and an encounter with two of my friends, musicians who were also his constituents; they were appalled to discover that he didn’t seem to have heard of the Fall, whose belligerent singer, Mark E Smith, lived for much of his life in Bury South. By the end of the evening, I had persuaded him to let me shadow him in parliament. After much to-ing and fro-ing, he eventually sent me screengrabs of his diary and told me to pick a day. We arrange to meet in Portcullis House, where MPs have their offices, at 9.30am one Tuesday, and he arrives 20 minutes late wearing a decidedly unparliamentary outfit of skinny jeans, bobbly blue jumper and a navy peacoat. He has shaved off the beard he sported on defection day and lost weight. He softly mutters an apology. We go down the escalator into the tunnel that connects Portcullis House with parliament, and a grey-haired man going up in the other direction clocks him. “Are you OK? Are you surviving?” asks Matthew Offord, the Conservative MP for Hendon. Just about, says Wakeford. “I’m glad about that,” says Offord, with a kind smile. Not everyone is so warm. Later, in Westminster Hall, Wakeford congratulates Jonathan Gullis, the Tory MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, on the birth of his second child. Gullis – who is one of Johnson’s most loyal defenders, having gone viral during the Omicron wave for jeering, maskless in the Commons – gives him a death stare. For other former colleagues, Wakeford is now a figure of fun. One whacks him on the back with her order paper as she sweeps past in central lobby, tutting: “For fuck’s sake, Wakeford. Always causing trouble.” It is Alicia Kearns, Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, who has recently earned the sobriquet of Pork Pie Plotter as the alleged leader of a plan to oust the prime minister. The plot was ultimately aborted, partly because Wakeford’s defection was viewed as so traitorous that some dissenters withdrew their calls for Johnson’s resignation. Wakeford seems disappointed that no one followed him across the floor. “Is it the effect I had hoped for – to galvanise support behind Boris?” he says. “No. But at the same time I still think he would have survived a vote of no confidence.” Once the north-west coordinator for Johnson’s leadership campaign, Wakeford has come to see the prime minister as a danger to democracy. “He’s never going to leave of his own volition. He’s literally going to be dragged out, screaming,” says Wakeford. He denies owing his election to Johnson: “People didn’t just vote Conservative for Boris. There was also the anti-Corbyn vote, especially in a seat like mine.” Bury South has the biggest Jewish population of any constituency outside London and the south-east, and many Jews felt the Corbyn administration turned a blind eye to antisemitism. In his maiden speech, Wakeford said a local woman approached him after his victory “with tears running down her face and the simple message: ‘Thanks to you and the Conservatives, we no longer have to leave the country.’” Local politics were complicated further by Labour’s suspension of Ivan Lewis, who had represented the seat since 1997, in a sexual harassment scandal. He ran in 2019 as an independent, winning 1,366 votes despite withdrawing his candidacy at the last minute and urging his former constituents to vote for Wakeford, again because of the antisemitism issue. Much of Wakeford’s time is spent advocating for the Jewish community. Although he is not Jewish himself, his maternal grandfather was Ukrainian. One of his first engagements, post-defection, was to travel to Kyiv to speak at a symposium ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day about the atrocities committed at Babyn Yar, where 100,000 people were murdered, many of them Jews. He has a Hebrew lesson every Monday – preparation for trips to Israel: “I also thought it would be a nice thing to do, to show I am committed to the community locally.” His first event of the day is with a group of year 6s on a visit to parliament from King David Orthodox primary school near his constituency. Do you think you’ll regret switching party, asks one child. Wakeford insists he’d do the same again: “The only thing I would try to change would be the effect it has had on friends. These are friends I’ve had for 15, 16 years. They came to my wedding, I went to their weddings, they came to the christening of my daughter. I know I’ve hurt them deeply.” The friend he is saddest to have lost is Andrew Stephenson, MP for Pendle and minister for HS2. Wakeford, while a county councillor and chair of the Lancashire Conservatives, worked in Stephenson’s constituency office, and Stephenson encouraged him to become an MP. The night before his defection, Wakeford went for dinner at Stephenson’s home along with other MPs from the 2019 intake, including Chris Clarkson, who won the Greater Manchester seat of Heywood and Middleton. Wakeford says Clarkson was appalled at the subsequent betrayal; he called him “Judas” to his face and referred to him as “Christian Wokeford”. Wakeford stayed until midnight and made no mention of the bomb he was about to drop on them all. Wasn’t there a moment when you thought: I probably should swerve this invitation, I ask. The day before, he had secretly met Keir Starmer, and he had been having clandestine meetings with Chris Elmore, a Labour whip, for months. “It was never meant to be taking place the next day,” he insists. “I explained to colleagues that I was seriously considering leaving the party, but I don’t think they understood that it was leaving to join Labour. I couldn’t tell them that.” At first, Wakeford says, he was looking for friends across the aisle. But then he and Elmore began meeting weekly in coffee shops around Victoria, bonding over the trials of having small children and their shared love of wrestling. The latter interest came in useful when one of the Tory whips walked into the cafe where they were plotting, and they switched the conversation to WWE. The final decision was made over Christmas. By the time of Stephenson’s dinner party, “it was a case of when, not if. But I was still thinking there would be weeks, slowly building up to it.” Wakeford says he now regrets attending because it “adds to the sense of betrayal”. Dehenna Davison, MP for Bishop Auckland and a close friend from the 2019 intake, tells me she is willing to forgive Wakeford. “It wasn’t so much the defection that hurt, though I still think he made a huge mistake, which I’ve told him,” she says. “It was the secrecy, and the fact some of us who were close to him were blindsided by it. I still consider him a friend – though our relationship has inevitably changed.” Wakeford says he was forced to jump sooner than planned when a journalist from the Times called the Labour press office saying they knew a defection was looming, and that they had four names they were about to run. Wakeford found out about the threat at 9.15am on 19 January, and met Elmore to discuss whether to call the paper’s bluff or go for it and “control the narrative”. He chose the latter: “It was a case of very quick pros and cons and, excuse my French but: ‘Holy shit, this is actually real now.’” Until that day, like many on the Tory benches he had regularly appeared in the chamber without a face covering, but he knew that would not wash on the Labour side, so he reached for the union jack mask. “Quite a lot of people have tried to talk about the symbolism and the patriotism, but it was literally the first one I grabbed from my coat.” It served a dual purpose: “It allowed me to hide my face and the emotion behind it. All I was thinking, sitting there, was: ‘Please don’t throw up, please don’t throw up.’ I was sitting opposite 300 former colleagues trying not to look at most of them, while trying to catch the eye of friends.” A few weeks before he crossed the floor, Wakeford had called Alan Howarth, a former MP now in the Lords, who defected from the Conservatives to Labour in 1995. Wakeford seemed “very steady, very sensible”, says Howarth, who offered advice on “what he would have to face, so that he could be well prepared, organisationally as well as morally and emotionally”. When Howarth joined Labour, the Tory whips mounted what he calls “a filthy operation to vilify me, and launched rumours about my mental health, my sexuality”. Within hours of Wakeford’s defection, the Tory whips began spreading rumours about his drinking, as well as other personal matters. The drinking is an interesting one: despite enjoying a pint (or five), he is chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on alcohol harm. He took on the job after talking in parliament about how his older brother died in a drink‑driving accident when three times over the limit. Mark Jones, 44, had been living with Wakeford since his marriage collapsed, and it was Wakeford who got the knock on the door from the police. At the time, Wakeford thought Mark had his drinking under control. “We’d tried to normalise it – to say, ‘If you want to have a drink, drink with us, you don’t have to hide it.’ What we didn’t realise was that there were three, four, five, six other drinks he was having in secret, in his room, in his car, all straight vodka.” Mark was one of four children Wakeford’s mother had before meeting Barry “Tony” Wakeford, a lecturer in catering at Blackburn College. The pair married and had Christian and his identical twin brother, Julian, a nurse. When the marriage broke down, the twins went to live with Barry, who died of bowel cancer when they were just 11. Wakeford became estranged from his mother shortly after Mark’s death. “It wasn’t the best relationship before, but it got quite toxic,” he says. He is vague about why he joined the Tories in 2003, saying he liked the idea of meritocracy; that “if you worked hard, you got rewarded”. Most of his views now, if not then, seem solidly New Labour, but there were certain Blair-era policies that put him off, such as the pledge to get 50% of children into university (despite having two degrees, he is a big fan of vocational education). He got into politics at Nelson & Colne college in Lancashire, where he enjoyed arguing with lefty classmates. “My approach has always been to try to find consensus where you can. Compromise isn’t a dirty word, even though down here in Westminster it has been treated like one. It’s almost like we’ve lost the art of disagreeing,” he says. His main teenage sparring partner, Richard Wyatt, says: “He was a relatively socially liberal Thatcherite at college. I’m from Burnley, and if you think back to that era there was quite a lot of disillusionment with Labour locally.” Cat Smith, the Labour MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, knew Wakeford at Lancaster University, where he came away with a third in politics, before doing a BSc in chemistry at the Open University and then working in insurance. They would go on nights out together “but we never talked about our respective politics. Like ‘normal’ students, I doubt either of us ever expected to be MPs,” she says. Even within his new party, Wakeford’s defection was not universally welcomed. Young Labour, the party’s youth wing, tweeted: “Christian Wakeford MP should not be admitted to the Labour Party. He has consistently voted against the interests of working-class people; for the £20 universal credit cut, for the nationality and borders bill and for the police and crime bill.” Now, Wakeford suggests the Tory whips helped drive him away. After his defection he accused former chief whip Gavin Williamson of threatening to withdraw funding from a new school in Radcliffe, a town in the Bury South constituency where Wakeford lives with his daughter and his wife, when he was education secretary. “It was very much along the lines of: ‘If you’re wanting a favour from the department, and it’s quite a big favour, it’s wise not to vote against the government,’” he says. He says he raised concerns after he was told to vote against the Dubs amendment of the Brexit bill, which would have allowed unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families in the UK. The whips assured him that the government was against it simply because it belonged in forthcoming immigration legislation. “I guess it is naive to be trusting, but when you’re new you don’t know. But there’s only so many times you can be told, ‘This bill isn’t the right place for that amendment, it will come forward in future legislation.’ And the future legislation comes forward and there’s no amendment.” He says he feels particularly bad about the Dubs amendment now. Whereas many of his former colleagues are obsessed with controlling immigration, Wakeford is relatively relaxed, and was against the cut to the international aid budget. “For those who think the biggest issue facing us right now is tackling all those small boats, well, surely that’s an argument for more international aid, to improve everyone else’s countries,” he says. “I do think we need a fairer immigration system, based on not where you are from, but what you can contribute to society. But it needs to be fair – that is the main thing.” His first rebellion came when he voted against Covid regulations in November 2020. When asked which vote with the government he most regrets, he cites the building safety bill on cladding, post-Grenfell. He helped the government defeat an amendment that would have stopped building owners passing on the crippling costs of fixing defects. His abstentions often came on opposition day debates tabled by Labour, which generally have no chance of passing but are designed to embarrass the government – such as the free school meals vote that prompted the protests outside his office, and another opposing a cut to universal credit. It was the latter that prompted the “Labour: bunch of cunts” message. After he defected, he apologised to Angela Rayner, Starmer’s plain-speaking deputy, who told him: “Don’t worry, I’m sure I’ve called you lot worse.” Wakeford must now win over the Bury South Labour party, which will vote in a few months on whether to allow him to stand for them in the next general election. Starmer has made it clear he thinks he is an electoral asset because of his Tory past, and has not offered to find him a safer seat, as Tony Blair did for Alan Howarth and Shaun Woodward. Wakeford insists most local members have been kind, particularly former Bury North MP James Frith, who welcomed him with a “massive hug”. Nathan Boroda, a young Labour councillor for Unsworth in Bury South, says constituents are split about Wakeford’s defection, but thinks he will win the so-called trigger ballot. According to Boroda, Wakeford still “has questions to answer, particularly over his voting record”. Do you trust him, I ask. There is a long pause. “I don’t know the answer to be honest,” says Boroda. “I’m still not sure about him.” Later on the day I meet Wakeford, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appears live by video link in the Commons to make an emotive appeal to MPs, but Wakeford is not there. He chooses to keep a prearranged appointment with two contacts from a Greater Manchester university, and takes them to the Strangers’ Bar. After two pints, we go off to give a group of young Jewish European leaders a tour of parliament, and then return to the bar, before attending not just a parliamentary tasting of beers made with British hops, but also a reception from the British cider industry. When I rush off to get my train I confess I feel a bit drunk. “Lightweight,” he says, before heading to a friend’s birthday party. Earlier I asked him outright if he thought he had a problem with alcohol. “Do I drink? Yeah. Do I think I’m a problem drinker? No,” he says, and the Tory whips’ smear campaign comes to his mind once again. “But to try to use that as a way to discredit me when some of the work I am most proud of is my work on alcohol harm was quite a nasty trick to play.” Seeing Wakeford hold forth at the bar made me think of something he told the King David schoolchildren earlier in the day as he urged them to consider careers in politics. “It’s an incredibly serious job,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun.” In the immediate aftermath of his defection, Wakeford seemed lonely and miserable. Watching him today, I can see he is also an MP who loves the boys’ club atmosphere in parliament, the banter, the drinking, the lobbyists competing for his ear. At one point in the afternoon, we attended a reception for Mondelez International, which owns the Cadbury brand. I assumed he had some special interest in regulating the sugar industry, but all we do is sample a chocolate fountain and have a laugh with some of his lobbyist friends. I like Wakeford, but there’s a certain naivety to him, which makes me think no one in his new party is giving him advice: was it wise to go drinking with a journalist when your enemies want to suggest you are a problem drinker? Shouldn’t he have been in the debating chamber for Zelenskiy’s historic address instead of the Strangers’ Bar? And what 37-year-old needs to remind himself each week to do his washing? Will he be the last of Johnson’s MPs to join the Labour benches? Maybe not, he says. “Do I think anyone else will cross? Possibly, and if they are thinking about it, they are probably looking at what is going on with me quite closely, and the warm reception I’ve received. My advice to them would be: give me a shout.”",News/Politics,"Tory defector Christian Wakeford on crossing the floor: ‘All I was thinking was, please don’t throw up’",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/tory-defector-christian-wakeford-crossing-floor-dont-throw-up
4/2/2022,"When Arthur Bondar came out of the metro station near Moscow’s Bolshoi theatre, he was heading to a book fair. Besides his work as a photographer, he collects second world war negatives, and there was a catalogue of work by the war photographer Olga Ignatovich he was excited to see. It was early afternoon in Moscow, a relatively mild December day of around -5 or -10C. “I was approaching Nikolskaya Street, which is usually packed with tourists, locals and street performers – that day there was a bunny and an angel. I was passing through a pedestrian crossroads. There had once been a monastery here, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, which closed in 1923 and was demolished in 1935. I’d never noticed the icon on the left before.” Bondar waited a few seconds for the bunny to clear the frame, then snapped a couple of shots on his iPhone X as the angel passed by under the arch. He doesn’t usually title his photographs, but gave this image one. Born in Ukraine, Bondar moved to Russia with his wife for work a decade ago. Today, he describes himself as a man between two countries. “I am in the country that attacks my motherland in a so-called ‘special military operation’, unable to help our relatives who are there under the shells. You can’t even imagine this nightmare – it’s all so illogical. I question if this could truly be reality. This photo is a good reflection of the situation – what is real and what is not?”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I’d never noticed the icon before’: Ukrainian photographer Arthur Bondar’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/02/never-noticed-icon-before-ukrainian-photographer-arthur-bondar-russia
4/2/2022,"The Teamsters’ new president has pledged his powerful union will step up the pressure on Amazon and mount its own efforts to unionize the company after workers in New York voted to form the company’s first US union. In an interview with the Guardian Sean O’Brien said it was vital to organize Amazon, asserting that the e-commerce company has “total disrespect” for its workers and was putting downward pressure on standards for unionized warehouse workers and truck drivers across the US. “You have an employer like Jeff Bezos taking a joyride into space, and he bangs on his workers to be able to fund his trip,” said O’Brien, who was inaugurated as Teamsters president on 22 March. He asserted that Amazon workers would benefit greatly from joining the Teamsters, saying that Amazon’s drivers and warehouse workers are treated and paid considerably worse than their unionized counterparts at other companies. “They’re awful, they’re disrespectful the way they treat their employees,” O’Brien said of Amazon. On Friday, a final vote count showed that Amazon workers in Staten Island voted to unionize, 2,654 for a union, 2,131 against. Another vote to organize workers in Alabama hangs in the balance. Amazon beat off the union drive by 118 votes but the final tally is awaiting a review of 416 challenged ballots. O’Brien said he applauds any organization that seeks to take on Amazon: “I commend anybody who tries to take on a schoolyard bully like Amazon.” The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union is seeking to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, while a new, independent union, the Amazon Labor Union, was behind the organizing at two Amazon facilities on Staten Island. O’Brien said that no union is better positioned than the Teamsters to organize Amazon because his 1.3-million-member union has decades of experience in unionizing and winning good contracts for warehouse workers and truck drivers. “This is the only union that has the proven track record of organizing workers in these industries,” O’Brien said. He said the Teamsters needed to organize Amazon as an obligation to “our members” and “our largest employers”, most notably United Parcel Service and DHL. Concerned that Amazon’s lower pay is undercutting Teamster employers and Teamster contracts, O’Brien said he didn’t want Amazon to threaten the livelihood of Teamsters or “diminish the standards established by collective bargaining agreements”. “We have to organize Amazon,” he said. “We have to have a plan in place. We have to execute that plan and not be scared to change that plan if it doesn’t work at times. Even a world champion team doesn’t win all the time. Hopefully we will have a favorable win-to-loss ratio.” Before winning a five-year term as Teamsters’ president, O’Brien headed a large Teamsters local in the Boston area for 15 years. He succeeded James P Hoffa, who stepped down after 23 years as Teamsters president. “We the Teamsters have the best resources out there, not just financially” to unionize Amazon, O’Brien said. “We have the ability to utilize our members who work in the industry, who know the benefits of working under a collective bargaining agreement and having dignity and respect in the workplace. “We have a lot of work to do,” he continued. “We have a plan to focus on the big metro cities,” where he said the likelihood of winning unionization elections would be greatest. He said that the Teamsters would mount “non-traditional campaigns” that include up lining politicians’ support and extensive community support behind unionization. He stressed the importance of worker-to-worker organizing: “We need to utilize our best organizers: our worker members who work in these industries.” Amazon officials say their company’s pay levels are competitive – $18 for a full-time entry-level worker in Staten Island and nearly $16 in Alabama. The company notes that its benefits, including health coverage, begin for full-time workers the day they join the company. Amazon officials have repeatedly said they are committed to maintaining an environment where its employees can thrive and feel appreciated and respected. News of the Staten Island victory comes as union activity is experiencing a resurgence in the US. Joe Biden has positioned himself as the most pro-union president in generations. “The Biden administration has done a great job for unions right out of the gate,” O’Brien said. “An administration that’s not afraid to endorse unions is great.” He praised, in particular, a 2021 law that Biden backed that helped secure the pensions of millions of union members and retirees, including many Teamsters whose pension plans were seriously underfunded. O’Brien said the Teamsters and other unions need to do a far better job explaining to Americans how unions lift workers and the nation as a whole. He said many Americans view the Teamsters favorably despite the movie The Irishman about scandals inside the Teamsters a half-century ago. “During the worst pandemic we’ll ever face people saw that we delivered packages, did trash pick-ups, did food and grocery deliveries,” O’Brien said. “We’ve proven our worth providing goods and services to keep this country moving.” He talked at length about the importance of holding politicians accountable, especially when they fail to back workers and unions. “I can’t remember people’s birthdays. But I can remember the last person that screwed me. That’s how we’re going to deal with those politicians who vote against us. We’ll run people against you. We’ll campaign against you.”",News/Technology,Teamsters president vows to pressure Amazon after New York votes for union,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/02/teamsters-president-sean-obrien-amazon-union
