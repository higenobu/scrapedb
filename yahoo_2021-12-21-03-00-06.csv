12/21/2021,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a sore throat or runny nose likely meant you were suffering from a cold — and some rest and fluids would help you get back to your regular self within a few days. However, with COVID-19 symptoms overlapping with the cold and flu, the diagnosis is not as clear based on symptoms alone. To add to the confusion, there's a new COVID-19 variant. Cases linked to the Omicron variant are soaring around the world as researchers race to find out more about the new strain. Omicron is a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 and was first reported to the World Health Organization on Nov. 24 after it was detected in South Africa. It has since spread to multiple countries, including Canada. Omicron has been classified as a variant of concern by the WHO and the organization says it is coordinating with many researchers around the world to better understand the new strain. Omicron has a large number of mutations, which could mean the virus acts differently from other variants that are circulating, according to the WHO. As for its spread, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains the variant will likely spread more easily than previous strains. However, it’s still too early to know how it compares to the Delta variant in that regard. “Omicron has a bunch of mutations in an area that might make it more transmittable and it looks like it likely is more transmittable, but the exact mechanism is not clear yet,” said Dr. Lisa Barrett, an infectious disease specialist at Dalhousie University in Halifax. “It will at least get around some of the protection from infection that vaccines provide, but there’s still good protection so far from severe disease and death.” With the possibility of many Canadians getting sick this cold season, many people are wondering how symptoms of a regular cold differ from something more serious like Omicron. However, making that distinction is more difficult than it sounds. The common cold is a viral infection of your upper respiratory tract — your nose and throat — according to the Mayo Clinic. Someone with a cold may experience a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough and body aches. COVID-19 is also a respiratory virus, and someone who is infected will experience similar symptoms. In some cases gastrointestinal symptoms, like diarrhea and nausea, can also overlap between the coronavirus and the cold. The one symptom you can experience with COVID-19 and not with influenza is loss of smell. However, many people with the coronavirus don’t lose their sense of smell and Barrett says it’s not a “useful tool to differentiate between the two.” With both infections giving off similar effects, self-diagnosing is not a safe option. When experiencing any of the mentioned symptoms, the only way to know for sure is to get tested. It's still too early to know for sure, but some scientists and doctors have indicated that the Omicron variant generally results in less severe symptoms than the Delta variant.  Some health experts have said that symptoms include night sweats, fatigue, mild muscles aches and a scratchy, dry throat. And while early evidence may indicate the Omicron variant results in more mild symptoms among those with two (and especially three) vaccines, the picture is starkly different for unvaccinated patients. With cases of Omicron climbing across the country and the world, experts believe the variant will become the dominant strain very soon. In newly released modelling data Ontario’s Science Advisory Table suggests the new variant will become the dominant strain in the province this week. Barrett is concerned about how rapidly Omicron is spreading, but says she isn't panicking yet. “We do have to be careful what we do in the next number of weeks and so I’m concerned it’s spreading very quickly and it has the ability at least decrease the effectiveness of two doses of vaccine. We think a third dose can help to get around that fact,” Barrett told Yahoo Canada. By now the public is well versed in ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and experts advise more of the same. “I think it’s ambitious and somewhat naive to think that just keeping people from travelling is going to change the amount of Omicron in this country,” Barrett said. “What we do inside our borders and in our own towns and everyday life is far more important.” The World Health Organization says it will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available on Omicron. When it comes to what you can be doing, the recommendations haven’t changed. Wearing a good mask (experts recently advised Canadians ditch their single-layer cloth masks in favour of medical masks), social distancing especially when indoors, staying home when sick and washing your hands regularly are good practices everyone should be maintaining throughout the cold season and the pandemic. And of course, get your booster. Health officials are urging Canadians that the best way to protect from the Omicron variant right now is to get your third COVID-19 vaccine shot when you are eligible.

12/21/2021,"After Manchin announced his opposition to the Build Back Better, the White House criticized him. Manchin was asked about the statement in a Monday interview with a West Virginia radio station. ""Basically, they retaliated. I figured they would come back stronger,"" he said. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia responded on Monday to a strongly-worded White House statement that denounced him for declaring his opposition to the Democrats' Build Back Better social spending and climate bill. ""Basically, they retaliated. I figured they would come back strong,"" said Manchin on Talkline with Hoppy Kercheval. After the West Virginia Democrat announced on Fox News Sunday that he was opposed to the Democrats' $2.2 climate and social spending bill, the White House issued a lengthy missive that was critical of the senator. ""Senator Manchin promised to continue conversations in the days ahead, and to work with us to reach that common ground,"" said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki in the statement. ""If his comments on FOX and written statement indicate an end to that effort, they represent a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the President and the Senator's colleagues in the House and Senate."" Manchin reportedly informed the White House of his decision just 30 minutes before his Fox News spot, refusing a call from them as they sought to talk Manchin down from his position. And CNN reported that President Joe Biden, who has sought to persuade the conservative Democrat to support the bill in recent months, personally signed off on the subsequent White House statement. ""Just as Senator Manchin reversed his position on Build Back Better this morning, we will continue to press him to see if he will reverse his position yet again, to honor his prior commitments and be true to his word,"" Psaki said in the statement. ""In the meantime, Senator Manchin will have to explain to those families paying $1,000 a month for insulin why they need to keep paying that, instead of $35 for that vital medicine."" Other Democrats reacted angrily to Manchin's statement, and the fate of a bill central to Biden's domestic agenda now hangs in the balance. With the House having passed its own version of the bill in November, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pledged on Monday to bring the bill up for a vote in the upper chamber ""so that every Member of this body has the opportunity to make their position known on the Senate floor, not just on television,"" he said. Manchin, for his part, seemed mostly unperturbed when Kercheval asked about the White House statement and Democratic anger towards him. ""They figured, surely to God, we can move one person, surely we can badger and beat one person, that's — surely we can get enough protesters to make that person uncomfortable enough,"" said Manchin, referring to the waves of protest that he's encountered from progressive activists in recent months. ""Well, guess what? I'm from West Virginia,"" he said. ""I'm not from where they're from, and they can just beat the living crap out of people and think they'll be submissive. Period.""

12/21/2021,"The dog version of a Christmas miracle is playing out in Ohio. Familiar details include an expectant couple traveling roads alone, no room in the inn, and a wise man bearing gifts. “While heading home one night, State Wildlife Officer Gus Kiebel, assigned to Adams County, found two beagles in the road,” the Ohio Division of Wildlife posted Dec. 17 on Facebook. “Afraid they would get hit by a vehicle, Officer Kiebel and another driver caught the dogs and put them in his patrol truck to get warm. “Unable to reach an owner, Officer Kiebel took the dogs home to give them some food and keep them warm for the night,” the post said. “The next morning, Officer Kiebel discovered the female was pregnant.” It later became clear the dogs were on the road that night because they had been abandoned, the state reported. Realizing there was no happy reunion in the making, Kiebel and his wife contacted a nonprofit shelter and found a place for the dogs to stay, including veterinarian care. Then the rest of the community stepped up. The beagles were adopted as a couple “and renamed Johnny & June,” likely in tribute to country singer Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter Cash. The new owners weren’t identified. And the state didn’t say if the puppies are due around Christmas. “We hope they’ll be out chasing rabbits someday soon,” the division added. The Facebook post included a photo of the two dogs curled up together in Kiebel’s truck. The post has gotten 4,400 reactions and more than 280 comments, including some who noted similarities to the Biblical nativity journey of Joseph and Mary. “Well that’s familiar!” Angel Heilman wrote on Facebook. “Perfect ending,” Angelia An said. “This touched my heart,” Virginia Metheny posted.
