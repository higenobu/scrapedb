1/6/2022,"Hello, good morning, hope we’re all holding up alright, and if not, hopefully this can be a temporary distraction. It’s Five Great Reads, your weekday summertime wrap of hope, joy and great journalism, selected by me – Guardian Australia’s feelings, frocks and fish sauce editor, Alyx Gorman. If you’ve come here for hard news then please let me redirect you to my far more capable pals over at the Morning Mail for a primer on the day ahead; and to our live blog for the day’s events as they unfold.  (Psst… Newsletter subscribers, don’t read this part.) This is an article but it’s also an email newsletter you can sign up for, by popping your details right here. (Okay! Okay you can start reading again!) Today we have reads on self help, cycling and slum influencers, plus the weirdest academic conference you’ve never heard of. Let’s hop to it. Armed with a GoPro and fuelled by a tragic backstory, Mike van Erp, AKA CyclingMikey, has reported over 1000 dangerous drivers – including Guy Ritchie. So he’s like Batman on a bike? He really prefers not to be referred to as a vigilante, actually. He’s just very into road safety rules, and doesn’t have to go out of his way to find people who break them. Notable quote: “Most people who cycle realise that bad driving is largely tolerated by society,” van Erp says. “It’s not considered a really serious thing. Yet it’s claiming 1,800 people’s lives a year in the UK alone.” If he thinks London’s bad he should visit Sydney … Indeed. How long will this take me to read? About five minutes. Nasser Sari’s cheerful snaps of life in one of France’s poorest neighbourhoods has earned him a massive social media following. Now he plans to flex that influence by standing for national assembly. Notable quote: “I want to shatter the cliches,” Sari says. “I’m young, of colour, someone who dares. I want to annoy people a bit. To show France who we are.” Could he win? “Pyrenées-Orientales has about 350,000 registered voters,” Phil Hoad reports. “If only a portion of NasDas’s followers vote for him, he could be Snapchatting from parliament this time next year.” How long will it take me to read? Just under five minutes. No longer niche, everyone from Michelle Obama to James Clear has a guided journal these days. So are they any good? Jenny Valentish road-tests a sample, with mixed results. What is a guided journal? That depends – it can be anything from hardback diaries with cutesy prompts (“What did you dream of last night?” “Draw something that makes you happy”) to workbooks that border on therapy handouts. What are they for? Everything from decluttering to drinking less: goal-setting, productivity and even dismantling privilege (there’s a guided journal edition of Layla Saad’s Me and White Supremacy). I don’t feel like journaling. Then read Elle Hunt seeking expert advice on how to achieve your goals instead. No doodling required. Still too hard. Fine, make some dal. It’s quick, healthy and freezes well. Why did a group of academics hold an online symposium dedicated to the cult 2017 animated film Boss Baby? For the lols, obvs. But maybe also kind of not? I’ve never seen Boss Baby, why should I read this? Because it’s funny and surprisingly thoughtful – even if you haven’t seen the film. Which I also have not. Yes, but you once used Bourdieu’s concept of habitus as a framework for analysing Gossip Girl in an undergraduate essay. Opht, straight for the jugular. I got an HD for that essay though. How a country that still struggles to keep the lights on became one of the world’s most-vaccinated nations. Cuba is one of the world’s most vaccinated nations? Yep, more than 90% of the population (kids included) have been vaccinated with at least one dose and 83% are fully vaxxed. Oh – and they developed the vaccine themselves. Also: vaccination isn’t mandatory. Notable quote: “Ever since the 1959 revolution, Cubans have embarked on these grand crusades which are quixotic yet often successful,” says Gregory Biniowsky, a Havana-based lawyer. Case in point: Fidel Castro’s vast investment in biotech after the fall of the Soviet Union. “Any rational adviser would have said this was not the time to invest resources in something that might bear fruit in 25 years. And yet here we are now … where these fruits of the biotech investment are saving lives.” How long will it take to read?

1/6/2022,"The acquittal of the Colston Four will prompt close scrutiny of the actions of the home secretary, Priti Patel, who became personally involved in ensuring that they were pursued through the criminal justice system. Hours after the statue of the slave trader was toppled on 7 June 2020, Patel appeared on Sky News to demand that police pursue those responsible, saying their behaviour was “utterly disgraceful”.  “It is right that the police follow up on that and make sure that justice is taken, undertaken, with those individuals that are responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour,” she said. Two days later, it emerged that she had also called Andy Marsh, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, to demand an explanation. Her comments and subsequent actions have been queried by close observers. Nazir Afzal, the former chief prosecutor for northwest England, questioned why she appeared to have become so heavily involved in pursuing those involved instead of leaving decisions to police and prosecutors. “We have a tripartite regime for a reason and that is so that politicians do not get involved in the operational decisions taken by the police,” he told the Guardian. “It may be that she has overstepped the boundaries of that arrangement that we have had for nearly 200 years. It is not something that I think she would want to repeat.” Stuart C McDonald, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson, said the prosecution always appeared uncalled for, ill-considered and a waste of resources. “The home secretary’s meddling was inappropriate, ill-judged and shows how totally out of touch she is,” he said. This is not the first time Patel has faced criticism for involvement in police operations, particularly when it comes to confronting demonstrators. Police sources told the Guardian last year that heavy-handed tactics used at the Sarah Everard vigil followed a meeting at the Home Office where it was made clear the government wanted a pandemic ban on large gatherings to be enforced. Senior officers were told Patel would make a statement saying so – but the statement never came, it was claimed. Whitehall sources said Patel repeatedly criticised local police for not protecting the Colston statue in 2020 or making arrests on the day. The dilemma they faced was explained and justified by the Avon and Somerset force’s Supt Andy Bennett, who was acutely aware of the campaign against the statue and why officers could not be seen to defend it. “[Colston was] a historical figure that’s caused the black community quite a lot of angst over the last couple of years. So while I am disappointed that people … damaged one of our statues, I do understand why it’s happened, it’s very symbolic,” he told the BBC. “We made a very tactical decision that to stop people doing that act may have caused further disorder.” Labour MPs suspect that ministers have become obsessed with the issue of statues and whether they may be toppled because they are pursuing a “war on woke”. Kerry McCarthy, the MP for Bristol East, said in March: “We know what it is about. It is about stoking up social and cultural anxieties to win votes, seeking out not what we have in common, but what divides us, fanning the flames.” But Labour are facing their own dilemma following the verdict. Keir Starmer sparked unease across the left of his party the day after the Colston statue was toppled by condemning the actions of the protesters. In a clear shift in tone from Jeremy Corbyn’s attitude to civil disobedience, Starmer told LBC radio: “It shouldn’t have been done in that way, [it was] completely wrong to pull a statue down like that. “[But] stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. We can’t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.” As of Wednesday night, neither Patel nor Starmer had released a statement commenting on the verdict.",Global,Did Priti Patel cross a line in urging pursuit of the Colston Four?,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/05/did-priti-patel-cross-a-line-in-urging-pursuit-of-the-colston-four
1/6/2022,"Britain’s economic recovery stalled before the arrival of the Omicron variant of Covid and the dampening effect of the government’s plan B restrictions on consumer spending in the Christmas shopping period, a wide-ranging company survey has found. Businesses blamed spiralling inflation and shortages of imported goods for a decline in sales in the fourth quarter, which meant that an expansion during the spring and summer ground to a halt.  In a message that will concern the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the British Chambers of Commerce added that many respondents to its quarterly survey of almost 5,500 firms revealed that they were running low on cash and had ditched investment plans to stay afloat into the new year. Suren Thiru, the BCC’s head of economics, said sales growth stalled as firms struggled with the “mounting headwinds” of inflation, a scarcity of skilled workers, and problems sourcing products from overseas. “The persistent weakness in cash flow is troubling because it leaves businesses more exposed to the economic impact of Omicron, rising inflation and potential further restrictions,” he said. The survey also found that the prospect of Bank of England officials raising interest rates was another concern for firms that had taken on extra debt over the last 20 months to cope with the pandemic. The bank raised rates to 0.25% in December. A series of reports have shown the UK economy heading into a challenging spring, with a strong rise in consumer prices hitting household disposable incomes and denting consumer confidence. Official figures showed the consumer prices index (CPI) jumped to 5.1% in November following persistent increases in oil and gas prices and other commodities, including wheat and copper. Consumer spending has underpinned the recovery, accounting for more than 80% of the UK’s growth, while spending on government services such as the NHS has made up much of the difference. Only a minority of businesses have pushed ahead with spending on new equipment, buildings and machinery, despite the offer of tax subsidies on investment, made in the budget last March. In the second quarter of 2021 GDP growth hit 5.5%, but fell back to 1.3% in the third quarter. The BCC survey, which was conducted in the last week of November, indicated that the economy was on course to flatline in the fourth quarter. It was likely the economy would contract in the first months of this year as the message to work from home and avoid large gatherings affected sales, Thiru said. Thiru added: “The UK economy is starting 2022 facing some key challenges. The renewed reluctance among consumers to spend and staff shortages triggered by Omicron and plan B may mean that the UK economy contracts in the near term, particularly if more restrictions are needed. “Rising inflation is likely to limit UK’s growth prospects this year by eroding consumers’ spending power and squeezing firms’ profit margins and their ability to invest. The notable uptick in concerns over higher interest rates underscores the need for the Bank of England to proceed with caution on further rate rises to avoid undermining confidence and an already fragile recovery.” A separate survey by the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (Cips) found that 85% of the 228 firms questioned experienced supply chain disruption last year. A quarter of the firms said suppliers shutting down due to Covid restrictions caused them the most acute supply shortages. The majority (71%) of those experiencing disruption and shortages expected it to last for six months or more, while more than a third said shortages would persist into 2023. The Institute of Directors said its economic confidence index had tumbled from -6 in November to -17 this month, a sign of nervousness among business owners about the UK’s economic prospects. It said three-quarters of company directors expected costs to rise in the next 12 months, and most said they would raise prices to either fully or partially offset the rise in costs. A snapshot of the UK’s manufacturing sector in December showed supply chain disruption and staff shortages continued to hold back growth. The IHS Markit/Cips survey showed growth in UK factory output was limited last month by Covid restrictions and Brexit weighing on orders and pushing up costs. Inflows of new work from overseas dropped for the fourth month in a row. The BCC director general, Shevaun Haviland, said: “Supply chain disruption is continuing to persist, inflation is soaring, and rising energy costs are presenting firms with a huge headache. “With companies now having to grapple with the impact of Omicron and further changes to the rules on imports and exports of goods to the EU, there are significant hurdles for businesses in the months ahead.”",News/Business,Britain’s stalling economy blamed on inflation and product shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/britains-stalling-economy-blamed-on-inflation-and-product-shortages
1/6/2022,"There is an intern inside Diane Morgan’s beehive. The person, after being shrunk to fit, operates a tiny control panel to create Morgan’s facial expressions. The only problem is that they are not very good at it. Perhaps the hairspray Morgan wears for her role in Mandy (BBC Two) has clouded the intern’s brain. They keep pulling on the lever that twitches her pursed lips into a lop-sided smirk, or using the rotator ball to make her Marty Feldman-like eyes swivel in a parody of human sarcasm. Or at least, this is my explanation for why Morgan’s performance as the titular mardy, functionally unemployable Lancastrian tends towards the two-dimensional. It not only accounts for why Mandy is obsessively focused on keeping her hairdo in place. It also explains why there is not the remotest hint that Mandy’s character will develop.  She looks like a homage to Coronation Street’s Bet Lynch, with her heels and hatchet glares, but has none of Bet’s rounded humanity or narrative arc. She more closely resembles other Lancastrian comic ciphers such as Twinkle in Dinnerladies (played by Morgan’s friend and fellow Boltonian Maxine Peake), who was forever subverting her boss’s patriarchal mind games with lines including: “All right, keep your scrotum on.” Or Caroline Aherne’s checkout girl in The Fast Show, deriding shoppers’ purchases: “Parmesan cheese? Smells like a tramp’s crotch.” The twist here is that Mandy is neither an ancillary character nor delivering a gag in a weekly sketch, but rather intended to carry the series. You might think that Morgan’s character should seem to involve more than being manipulated from within her hair by a tiny, undertrained intern. But that is to miss the magnificence of Mandy. In a sense, this is a revolutionary sitcom, dedicated to the philosophy that people don’t really change and that richly developed narratives aren’t all that. There is an episode of Seinfeld in which Kramer test-drives a car to see how far he can go without putting in more gas. Mandy is like that: how far can she go with zero character development and only the most threadbare storylines? Not as far as season three, I would guess, but I have been wrong before. In this episode, the season two premiere, Mandy is sent by jobcentre lackeys to work at a stately home. Her previous jobs all ended in disaster: there were fatalities after she ineptly processed fruit at a banana plant, and she saw an alien in the aisles while working in Co-op, where she racked up a £79 bill for edam after wilfully misinterpreting the staff discount. At Brampton Hall, Mandy dresses as a scullery maid and takes visitors on tours exploring the house’s past. “This is the room where John the Baptist died,” she explains to sceptical couples in jumpers. It is as if Lucy Worsley turned up for a TV documentary gig in period costume but knew nothing about history and decided brazenly to invent nonsensical claims on the fly, staring dead-eyed at anyone who doubted her. Offered folding money by some dimwit tourist, she reveals more of the house’s history: “Ronnie and Reggie used to live here, but were killed because they stole Michael Heseltine’s ashtray.” Mandy, then, is the soul sister of Philomena Cunk, the gormless know-nothing pundit created by Charlie Brooker and performed by Morgan. She is also closely related to Liz – whom Morgan plays in Motherland – a woman heroically scathing about the middle-class pieties of child rearing. Later, Mandy is tasked with serving nibbles at a book reading in the hall, but she takes the vol-au-vent tray to the wrong room and finds herself among satanists conducting a black mass. That furious clattering noise you can hear is National Trust and English Heritage press officers typing statements distancing themselves from Brampton Hall’s employment practices and room-hire policies. Long story short, Mandy is strapped to an altar by masked yet unacceptably naked satanists and rescued only when Lola, her designated-driver mate, shows up. “What the devil is going on here?” Lola exclaims. “My badminton got cancelled,” says one devil worshipper. Then Lola smacks the men’s bare buttocks (the biggest laugh of the episode, in my book) and chases them off. Why satanic ritual requires nudity is beyond me. The episode ends with two revelations. The first I won’t disclose, but if you can’t guess the identity of at least one satanist, you are too dim to be watching Mandy. The second is more astounding. According to the credits, the show was written and directed by Morgan – not by a homunculus inside a hairdo. I would never have guessed.",Arts/Television & radio,Mandy review – slap my bum and call me a satanist!

1/6/2022,"Italy has made it obligatory for people aged 50 or more to be vaccinated against Covid-19 as the country scrambles to ease pressure on hospitals and reduce deaths amid a dramatic surge in infections. The measure is among the toughest vaccine mandates in Europe and takes effect immediately. The move was unanimously supported by ministers despite divisions between the parties that make up prime minister Mario Draghi’s broad coalition before the cabinet meeting on Wednesday.  Italy also tightened its workplace vaccine rules and from 15 February, people aged over 50 who are in jobs, either in the public or private sector, will have to present a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from Covid-19. Hospitals are under increasing pressure because of the Omicron variant. Italy registered 189,109 new infections on Wednesday and 231 fatalities, bringing the death toll to 138,276, the highest in Europe after the UK. Health minister Roberto Speranza said that two-thirds of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units were unvaccinated, as were 50% of the patients being treated in ordinary wards. “We are making these choices in order to restrict the unvaccinated as much as possible, as this is what is causing the burden on our hospital system,” Speranza told the Italian media after the cabinet meeting. Business leaders had urged the government to make the vaccine mandatory for all workers over fears that the latest wave of the pandemic could slow down the economy. Draghi had sought to toughen up the vaccine mandate last week, but the cabinet failed to agree on a measure and so the talks were postponed. “We want to slow the growth of the infection curve and push Italians who are not yet vaccinated to get vaccinated,” Draghi said at the start of the cabinet meeting, according to the news agency Ansa. “We are targeting the age groups which are most at risk of hospitalisation in order to reduce pressure on hospitals and save lives. At the same time, we want to keep schools and businesses open.” Obligatory vaccines were already in place for health workers, teachers and the police. Austria is making vaccines obligatory for the over-14s from February, while Germany is planning to introduce a vaccine mandate for adults. Italy’s latest move follows the tightening of measures regarding the so-called super green pass last week. From Monday, people will no longer be able to dine in or outside a restaurant, go to the gym or use public transport unless they can prove immunisation or recovery from Covid.",News/World news,Italy makes Covid vaccinations compulsory for over-50s,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/italy-makes-covid-vaccinations-compulsory-for-over-50s
1/6/2022,"Former US talkshow host Jon Stewart says comments he made about the Harry Potter films were meant to be “lighthearted” and he was not accusing author JK Rowling of antisemitism. The comedian said news outlets had “piled into this ridiculously out of context nonsense”, and he did not want the franchise censored “in any way”.  It comes after a clip emerged of Stewart discussing scenes from the film set in the magical bank Gringotts, run by goblins, on the podcast The Problem with Jon Stewart. In it, Stewart made comparisons between caricatures from antisemitic literature and the “folks that run the bank”. Speaking in a video posted on Twitter, he said: “There is no reasonable person that could have watched it and not seen it as a lighthearted conversation amongst colleagues and chums. “Having a laugh, enjoying ourselves about Harry Potter and my experience watching for the first time in the theatre as a Jewish guy and how some tropes are so embedded in society that they’re basically invisible even in a considered process like movie-making. “This morning I wake up, it’s trending on Twitter, and here’s the headline … ‘Jon Stewart accuses JK Rowling of antisemitism.’” He added: “So let me just say this super clearly, as clearly as I can. “Hello, my name is Jon Stewart. I do not think JK Rowling is antisemitic. “I do not think the Harry Potter movies are antisemitic. “I really love the Harry Potter movies, probably too much for a gentleman of my considerable age. “I cannot stress this enough – I am not accusing JK Rowling of being antisemitic. She need not answer to any of it. “I don’t want the Harry Potter movies censored in any way. It was a lighthearted conversation.” Representatives for Rowling said the author would not be commenting on Stewart’s remarks. In her world-famous books, the goblins that run Gringott’s Bank are depicted as ill-tempered, diminutive creatures who are the guardians of the gold. The first book describes one as “about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard, and Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet”. This story was amended on Wednesday 5 January 2022 to take into account Jon Stewart’s clarification of his earlier comments.",Arts/Books,Jon Stewart denies claims he accused JK Rowling of antisemitism,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/06/jon-stewart-denies-claims-he-accused-jk-rowling-of-antisemitism
