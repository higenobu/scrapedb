2/15/2022,"In recent years there has been a revived interest in the freedoms and oppressions of the 1970s (Emma Cline’s The Girls was slackly based on the Manson family cult, while Elizabeth Wetmore’s Valentine unfurled in the aftermath of male violence in 1970s Texas), and Welsh-born writer Sally J Morgan’s debut novel also wrestles with how this age of seeming progression was simultaneously a perilous time to be a woman. Morgan’s deep dive into the decade, recently awarded the Portico prize (offered to writing “that best evokes the spirit of the north of England”), reflects on her own close call with two of the UK’s most notorious serial killers. At age 21, while hitchhiking in Yorkshire, she was offered a lift by Fred and Rosemary West. Morgan’s fondness for catching a free ride is shared by her danger-chasing protagonist Jude Totton, nicknamed Toto, for whom “the edge between life and death glitters”.  The novel begins as this thrill-seeker moves with two friends, fellow art school graduates Nel and Jo, to the “roughest part of Leeds”, Chapeltown, “full of gangs that prey on the immigrants who can’t afford to live anywhere else”. Though the neighbourhood seems initially hostile – curses are scrawled across the front door – Toto fast befriends a local sex worker, Janice, and happens upon an anarchist alternative school where fugitives are occasionally hidden beneath the floorboards. Toto’s motley hangouts are vividly captured, from the motorway (“a river of metal, a flow of shining paintwork”), to her favourite pub (“a poky collection of fusty rooms, full of art students, anarchists, Irish republicans, homosexuals and prostitutes”), while northern dialects are affectionately threaded into the dialogue. Though Morgan’s writing is bold, it is not subtle, with the emotions of her characters often glaringly on their sleeves: “The intensity of being alive stuns me,” Toto narrates. “It’s so incomprehensible. So fucking unbelievably beautiful.” An ambient smattering of news headlines denoting attacks or disappearances of women gradually crescendos, yet Toto remains uncompromising in her daredevilry. She is nearly assaulted twice, by ex-soldiers implicated in Bloody Sunday, and then by an acquaintance, from which she emerges like a “drunken Boadicea, raising her arms in triumph after a night burning Rome to the ground”. Toto’s encounter with the Wests is comparatively fleeting, but the dread of them lurking in their unobtrusive pale-grey car lingers, finally bringing an end to Toto’s recklessness. Not all Morgan’s cast are left unscathed: housemate Nel’s narrative captures the insidiousness of male violence (on her relationship with boyfriend Simon, she muses that “Weakness and cruelty sit so close together in some people”), while the novel has an uneasy relationship with class and voyeurism, with the poorest residents of Chapeltown (the book’s truest victims) mildly fetishised by Toto but given little narrative space to breathe. Toto Among the Murderers is both propelled and held back by its earnestness, an honesty that is brought to bear on its meanderings around northern England’s “crumpled landscape”, its flirtations with death and on the queer love story that gradually blossoms between its two protagonists.

2/15/2022,"When Game of Thrones ended, I promised myself I would never again become invested in a sprawling medieval fantasy where humanity makes a desperate last stand against an apocalyptic foe, at the onset of an endless winter. It felt like a safe bet at the time. Then that trailer dropped. The finale of this grand strategy trilogy, set in the long-running Warhammer fantasy role-playing universe, never quite reaches the cinematic highs of the announcement video, but it comes impressively close; all swords, sorcery and symphonic metal. Too much story would only detract from the strategy sandboxes that define the Total War series anyway, where a Helm’s Deep or Battle of the Bastards can emerge spontaneously from any corner of its improv theatre of war. Still, if Warhammer 3 never hits such epochal fantasy plot beats, it provides one beautiful, batshit box of Lego for building your own.  The setup is the typical stuff of operatic fantasy: the roar of a dying god has torn apart the barrier that separates the mortal world from the daemonic realm of chaos. You play as one of eight factions with designs on that god’s power. Some want to protect their homelands. Some want dark glory. Some just want a good meal. Vivid lore snippets and vastly asymmetrical factions contribute to a heady blend of romantic and classical strategy game design. While it certainly helps if you’re already invested in the fate of the Old World on the eve of an onslaught by the ruinous powers, the freedom granted by Warhammer’s glorious silliness ultimately serves the genre by allowing for fantasy to inform tactical diversity. Battles veer towards the cinematic rather than the cerebral, but there’s still plenty of intense and interesting RTS gameplay. Any IP this fleshed out and chronicled still brings its own restrictions, of course. How do you do the chaos god’s reality-bending potential justice while not devolving into an all-out power fantasy? How do you lay out an even playing field for dark deities and squishy mortals? Mate. This is Warhammer. You make each faction so uniquely overpowered that your plague-borne regenerative abilities cancel out my invocation of an ancient bear deity’s icy wrath. The result is a spectacular lateral expansion of the traditional Total War dynamic. The power curve eventually balances out, even if it violently contorts into a few flaming sigils on its way there. There are a few outliers, of course. The game recommends either Slavic, icy Kislev or the undivided Daemons of Chaos as a first pick. Both are narratively satisfying extensions of an excellent story prologue, but Khorne’s destructive momentum and Cathay’s defensive bulwark are far more forgiving starters. A relentless spilling of demonic forces across the map makes for an intense, breathless campaign. Thematically evocative, sure, but also a contributor to the game’s biggest issue: a harsher autoresolve and tighter map means a tiresome number of forced manual battles. Asymmetry aside, all factions share a campaign objective: navigate the four realms of chaos and wrest a Daemon Prince’s soul from each, while building your forces and securing your empire in the interim. It’s a structure that lets you play tall, or roleplay on the defensive, though painting the map and eliminating rivals is an alternate victory condition. The eventual promise of the trilogy is “Immortal Empires” – a combination of all three games’ maps and factions into one grand depiction of the Old World. As such, most additions are quality of life changes rather than dramatic overhauls. The long-requested siege rework is still welcome, with mixed results. Towers and barricades are powerful, if a touch arcadey, but the real upgrade here is improved settlement map design. Open streets, palisades, perches and choke points make for a far more evolved and interesting take on a prevalent series weakness. It’s also a real looker, providing you can find the beauty in blighted, fetid hellscapes and snow-capped crags. The setting’s real trick has always been how it stays tongue-in-cheek about its own excess while still worldbuilding with earnest imagination, and Creative Assembly cap off the trilogy with some of its most gripping – and funniest – writing. The continual design evolution of one project split over three full games and dozens of expansions makes me hesitant to call Warhammer III a landmark strategy game in its own right. But looking back now at that very first trailer, it does feel like a promise kept.  Total War: Warhammer III is released on 17 February; £40.",Arts/Games,"Total War: Warhammer III review – swords, sorcery and symphonic metal",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/15/total-war-warhammer-iii-review-medieval-strategy-game-design
2/15/2022,"Max von Sydow, in his final film role, does what he can to lend gravitas to this odd, stilted and contrived movie, a fictional drama based on a horrendous Nazi atrocity in occupied Greece in 1943, for which the question of reparations still grumbles on. In Kalavryta in the northern Peloponnese, nearly 700 civilians were shot by the Nazi forces, in chilling reprisal for Greek resistance fighters executing 78 German soldiers taken prisoner. Von Sydow plays Nikolas, an ageing Greek writer who as a young boy miraculously escaped the massacre, but has been haunted by it ever since. In the present day, Astrid Roos plays Caroline Martin, an ambitious Berlin lawyer who is tasked by a heartless and cynical German government to go to Greece and to find details that might undermine their case for reparations. The tense occupation and slaughter of 1943 themselves are recounted in flashback, and director Nicholas Dimitropoulos makes a reasonably workmanlike job of this drama. But the film strangely insists on imagining a balancing “good German” who supposedly helps the Greek women and children. It is his existence that Caroline refuses to use against the Greek government, due to that predictable crisis of conscience to which the action had been unsubtly leading from the outset. She, in effect, becomes the film’s second imaginary “good German”, whose behaviour is at odds with the cynical German government.  Oddly, Caroline finally goes on a trip to Austria to interview the sad and saintly widow of this fictional good soldier, and she is played by Alice Krige, looking if anything younger than Von Sydow, who was supposed to be a small boy at the time. The film’s one moment of real power comes when Caroline visits the real-life Museum of the Kalavrytan Holocaust and stands in front of the memorial gallery of photographs: the victims’ faces. That has real substance. This film doesn’t.  Echoes of the Past is available on 21 February on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Echoes of the Past review – contrived coda to a Nazi atrocity,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/15/echoes-of-the-past-review-contrived-coda-to-a-nazi-atrocity
2/15/2022,"American private equity tycoons are profiteering from the global climate crisis by investing in fossil fuels which are driving greenhouse gas emissions, a new investigation reveals. Oil and gas pipelines, coal plants and offshore drilling sites linked to Indigenous land violations, toxic leaks and deadly air pollution are among the dirty energy projects financed by some of the country’s largest private equity firms, according to an investigation by the corporate accountability non-profits LittleSis and the Private Equity Stakeholder Project (Pesp).  Private equity refers to an opaque form of financing away from public markets in which funds and investors buy and restructure companies including startups, troubled businesses and real estate. Globally, the industry manages more than $7tn for wealthy individuals and institutional investors such as mutuals, hedge funds, endowments and pensions, investing in every sector from retail chains and healthcare to prisons and weapons. Some of that money finances fossil fuel projects which release greenhouse gases that cause global heating. Higher atmospheric and ocean temperatures are directly linked to the rise in catastrophic weather events like drought, extreme temperatures and hurricanes. Yet unlike banks and other publicly listed companies, private equity is exempt from most financial disclosure rules making it extremely difficult to track their assets. It means people like firefighters and teachers whose pension funds are invested in private equity funds, have little way of knowing if their retirement nest egg is financing coal plants, oil wells or solar farms. The Private Equity’s Dirty Dozen report, shared exclusively with the Guardian, provides a snapshot of the industry’s involvement in some of the country’s most controversial fossil fuel investments, as well as the deep political and cultural ties of its wealthy executives. The investigation found: The Carlyle Group, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, owns dozens of oil and gas companies including a stake in NGP Energy Capital, which boasts its own major portfolio mostly focused on fracking and drilling in states like Texas, Wyoming and Colorado. Carlyle, which recently announced a target of net zero emissions by 2050, also partners with Hilcorp Energy – a major methane emitter with a track record of offshore spills in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico – on at least $4bn in equity and debt deals. (Methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, and accounts for about a quarter of today’s global heating.) Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co (KKR) has a controlling stake in the Coastal Gaslink pipeline in Canada, a 400-mile multibillion-dollar infrastructure project through unceded Indigenous territories that will transport fracked gas to a Pacific coast port for export to Asia. Police have deployed to evict protests and blockades organised by the hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en Nation. Co-founder Henry Kravis is a major Republican donor, donating $1m to Trump’s 2017 inauguration fund. Daniel Revers is the managing partner & founder of ArcLight Capital Partners, a top energy-focused private equity firm, who accompanied Trump to China in 2017 – reportedly to help recruit investors for an environmentally disastrous refinery in the US Virgin Islands. Last year the EPA enacted emergency powers to shut down the Limetree Bay oil refinery after multiple toxic leaks led to school closures and adverse health impacts on majority black communities. This was followed by a DoJ complaint alleging the refinery posed an imminent threat to public health and the environment, before Limetree filed for bankruptcy. Richard Kayne is a major Republican donor and co-founder of Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, the largest investor in energy pipelines in America. Kayne held a stake in the fifth largest oil pipeline developer in the world, the Plains All American Pipeline, when it was fined $60m for spilling 140,000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific and the California coast in 2015 – the state’s worst oil leak in 25 years. (The company sold its stock in 2021 but still has a seat on the board.) The findings have renewed calls for greater transparency in the booming private equity industry, so that communities bearing the brunt of toxic emissions and extreme weather can track the money behind the misery. “By plowing money into dirty coal plants, offshore drilling and deforestation, private equity threatens to undermine our hard work to tackle the climate crisis and advance environmental justice,” said Elizabeth Warren, former presidential candidate and member of the Senate committee on banking. “It’s just another page from private equity’s standard playbook: boost short-term profits at the expense of the long-term wellbeing of communities.” Alyssa Giachino, Pesp’s climate director and co-author of the report, said: “While communities have shouldered the harms from fossil fuel investments, private equity firms have built vast wealth. Many firms have adopted rhetoric around sustainability, but have yet to provide transparency on their holdings and impacts.” A KKR spokesperson said the company “wholeheartedly disagreed” with the report’s assertions. “Not only do we believe in – and our actions support – the need for a sustainable energy transition, we also believe in the value and importance of transparency, as evidenced by an extensive library of public disclosures including our Climate Action Report and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Report [among others].” Private equity firms have spawned an elite group of super-rich power brokers with deep ties in politics, the arts, sports and education sectors. In recent years, banks have come under growing criticism for bankrolling fossil fuel projects, while secrecy surrounding private equity has shielded the industry from the same scrutiny. Yet in 2020, state-owned institutions like public pension and sovereign wealth funds invested 22% of the trillions in their portfolios in private equity where – unlike the stock markets – only the wealthy and institutional investors have direct access to this capital. The nature of these investments, let alone their impacts, are notoriously tough to track, though according to financial data analysts PitchBook, there has been at least $1.1tn in private equity energy deals globally since 2010. It’s no secret that the oil and gas industry spends big on politics, contributing more than $700m through individual, Pac and outside donations since 2000, according to Open Secrets. More than 80% of the campaign contributions have benefited Republican coffers. But the financial sector is far and away the largest source of campaign contributions to federal candidates and parties. Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive and founder of Blackstone Group and the world’s 34th richest man according to Forbes, is a major Republican donor who has personally contributed to Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and former Georgia senator Kelly Loeffler who supported overturning the 2020 presidential result. (Schwarzman recognised Biden’s victory and condemned the January 6 insurrection.) Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity firm which manages $731bn in assets, co-owns (with ArcLight) one of America’s dirtiest coal plants, the General James Gavin power station in Ohio. Blackstone also has a significant stake in the owner of the Dakota Access pipeline – the oil infrastructure project which triggered the Standing Rock protest camp where Indigenous water protectors were brutalised by law enforcement. A spokesperson said: “Virtually none of the capital Blackstone invested in the last three years was in fossil fuel exploration and production. We have simultaneously invested over $15bn in projects that we believe are consistent with the energy transition.” The company does not make corporate donations. Democratic candidates have also benefited from fossil fuel investors. Adebayo Ogunlesi, founder and managing partner of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), has donated to Barack Obama and Joe Manchin, the coal-friendly West Virginia senator currently blocking Biden’s climate spending bill, Build Back Better. Ogunlesi oversees $79bn in assets, with over half of the company’s portfolio in energy investments, according to market data. GIP is part of a consortium which in 2020 bought a 49% stake in the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s infrastructure, in a deal worth $10bn that gives them lease rights to gas pipelines for the next 20 years. Ogunlesi, who is the senior director of Goldman Sachs and has sat on various boards at Harvard University, served alongside Blackstone’s Schwarzman on Trump’s business advisory council, which was abandoned after the former president described white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville as “very fine people”. The report details the symbiotic relationships between ultra-rich private equity executives and the rest of America’s elite such as Carlyle’s co-founder David Rubenstein, whose net worth is estimated at $4.6bn and sits on the board of several influential think tanks and arts. “It’s a big problem that ultra-wealthy private equity executives are able to use their fortunes to enmesh themselves on the boards of the most prestigious universities, cultural institutions and thinktanks,” said Derek Seidman, researcher with LittleSis and report co-author. “This helps them burnish their public reputations in ways that obfuscate the fact that they are, in reality, some of the world’s biggest oil barons.” ArcLight, GIP, Carlyle and Kayne Anderson did not respond to requests for comment.",News/Environment,‘Biggest oil barons’: the US private equity firms funding dirty energy projects,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/15/us-private-equity-firms-funding-dirty-energy-projects
2/15/2022,"When I was five, I would talk to my mother while she was in the bath. When she stood to get out, the water fell from her, her skin pink from the heat. Her body was miraculous to me. Women’s bodies are miraculous, with the things they can do, but I didn’t know any of that then. I just knew that she was soft and perfect, and mine. By the time my mother developed breast cancer, I was 30. She was double that age and there was an ocean between us: I was married and living in New York, so when the news came, I couldn’t hold her to me, or be a practical support. I sat on my bed and cried. The next time I saw her, it was all over. One breast removed and carefully reconstructed. The cancer gone. My husband asked me, as we approached my parents in the airport, whether it was OK to give my mum a hug. The surgery was recent; I wasn’t sure. But it was OK. She seemed the same.  It was only five years later that I found my lump. I didn’t have a grownup daughter: my son was a toddler and my daughter was unborn, curled inside, half-gestated. A month later, in May 2016, I was wheeled into theatre and my surgeon cut the tumour out. The surgeon was pregnant too, her rounded belly tight against her scrubs. It helped that we had that in common. It felt like a reason for her to take extra care with me; with us. I knew I should be grateful that the cancer was gone, but when I pulled my bandages off, alone in the bathroom, and saw what was left of my right breast, I wept. I looked uneven, unsightly. An ugly scar where my nipple used to be. My daughter was born into this whirl of sadness. She was early and she had to fight her own battles to live. I stood under a long, hot shower a few hours after giving birth to her, washing away the blood, willing her to survive. Day by day, she gathered strength, while I began to have poison pumped into me in three-week cycles. There is a genetic element to my family’s breast cancer story. My mother and I are not just unlucky; we are predisposed. When I was told that my chances of getting breast cancer again were about 50%, I asked the doctors to take away my breasts and my ovaries. I didn’t need to think it over. I had my ovaries removed in November, 2016, and a double mastectomy the following January. Now my body is more scarred than ever, with angry red lines across my abdomen and my breasts, where I have been cut and cut again. Now my daughter is five, and she talks to me as I step out of the shower. What does she make of my unconventional body? How will it shape her sense of what a woman should be? There are no women like me on the billboards or the TV adverts. No women whose bodies have been hacked and then sewn back together, whose bodies have turned on them. A woman’s body is a powerful thing, in both good and bad ways. I fear that my daughter’s breasts could turn out to be rotten, like mine, like her grandmother’s. That she may need to have them removed. Or, worse still, that she may choose not to, and I will worry every minute that she will become cancer’s victim. I know that, eventually, my daughter will start to understand that there are expectations of her, and of all women. I know that her attitude towards her body will be altered by them – but I hope it will be altered more significantly by my mother and me, by our scarred and miraculous bodies. By our hearts that are still beating, telling her that she is enough, however she looks, however she is. She is enough.

2/15/2022,"Ihave never been catfished by a kitchen appliance before, but I was always going to be vulnerable to the air fryer’s promise of “fabulous chips – just add air”. “Next level amazzzzing,” one Instagrammer panted. Another called it “a total gamechanger when it comes to cooking”, while Gordon Ramsay claimed the results are like food “cooked in oil, but [the air fryer] locks in the juice and the flavour is extraordinary”. Admittedly, Ramsay was starring in an advert for the Philips Airfryer at the time. But if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is: Philips was rapped over the knuckles by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2012 for that “just add air” tagline, given that the small print specified that oil was needed to produce the crisp, golden chips seen on screen (Philips now claims, more modestly, that its product requires “90% less fat”). To be honest, that wasn’t a deal-breaker for me. Anything that significantly reduces the litres of oil required for deep-fat frying is still an attractive prospect.  Although air fryers have been around for more than a decade, Google Trends data shows interest climbed vertiginously in 2020, with little sign of slowing. Sales at John Lewis were up 400% in 2021. In January, the New York Times devoted 1,800 words to exploring how the air fryer “crisped its way into America’s heart”, while the Telegraph called it “the must-have kitchen gadget you didn’t know you needed”. Yet the technology for the air fryer is nothing new. It is basically a countertop fan oven. Despite its name, it does not “fry” things. It bakes them, and it bakes them fast, because, like all ovens, it is a well-insulated box – one that heats up quickly because of its size, then cooks quickly thanks to the presence of an extra-powerful, well-located fan to push that heat around. The sleek, black Ninja Air Fryer Max (£149.99) I borrow, with its “max crisp technology” and “super-fast airflow”, looks reassuringly space age. It has roughly the same footprint as the small microwave I have never had room for, but this is the future of cooking, so I make the room. (Clare Andrews, the lockdown convert behind the Air Fryer UK blog, recommends you do your research: “They come in all shapes and sizes. Some are much larger than others, some look more stylish. It’s all about weighing up your needs and preferences.”) As this feels like starting again in the cooking department, I put myself in the capable hands of the nutritionist Jenny Tschiesche, whose Air-Fryer Cookbook (Ryland Peters & Small, £16.99) promises that an all-day breakfast is “possibly the laziest meal … you can prepare in the air-fryer!” I heat the Ninja to 180C, which takes three minutes, and arrange tomatoes on the slotted, non-stick shelf inside. After three minutes, I add bacon, black pudding (Tschiesche calls for a mushroom, but she is a nutritionist and I’m not) and a whole egg, then shut the drawer while I make tea and toast. To my amazement, I end up with a perfect soft‑boiled egg, a well-cooked tomato, crisp bacon and cooked black pudding in under 15 minutes … and just one pan to wash up. One of the best things about my new gadget is how easy it is to play around with it; it would be great for students, or kids taking their first steps into independent cookery. An air-fryer cheesecake recipe went viral recently. I’m tipped off about the magic of air-fryer cheese toasties, corn on the cob, pakoras and reheated pizza. Correspondents report good results with everything from croquetas de jamon to flourless chocolate cake; someone’s mum in Sri Lanka uses it to cook vada (crispy snacks that are usually deep-fried), and reports “total success without all the oiliness”. Tschiesche loves it for how fuss-free it makes cooking fish in particular, and the Manchester chef Zosima Fulwell, who did a Christmas dinner in hers, says: “It’s pretty much replaced my oven.” Four days later, I think I have the measure of the air fryer. Notable wins include a whole (small) red mullet cooked without a whiff of fish, crispy chickpeas and some of the nicest brussels sprouts I have eaten. Failures include chewy calamari and tofu with the texture of a pool float. Frozen chips are crisper than their oven-baked equivalents – and ready in half the time. I’m also able to bake a frozen ball of cookie dough in 15 minutes, which makes the air fryer a potentially dangerous object to have around. Best of all, the short cooking times mean I don’t feel guilty putting the Ninja to work for small amounts of food. Most air fryers run at a considerably lower wattage than the average oven. But when I ask Dr Christian Reynolds, a senior lecturer at the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London, if they are a good bet for those of us trying to save energy (ie just about everyone), he says the situation is nuanced: “It depends how many people you’re feeding. They can be more energy-efficient for individuals, but it very much depends on your lifestyle.” In other words, because they can’t accommodate as much food as a full-size oven, you may need to put them on twice – once for fish fingers and again for chips, say – and so you might not be saving much money. He calculates that it would cost me 9p to cook a baked potato in the air fryer and 16p to do so in the oven. For maximum energy efficiency, he recommends microwaving the potato first (about 0.26p) and then finishing it in the air fryer, to crisp the skin. The award-winning food writer Melissa Thompson says she often uses the air fryer to reheat things. Unlike a deep-fat fryer, however, it is not capable “of sealing something, cooking the interior and then crisping up the exterior”, she adds. “For me, they’re similar to a Thermomix [a fancy multifunction food processor much beloved of chefs] – you need to start out with one before you buy other gadgets, otherwise you’re just doubling up.” I can confirm, having tried them, that Thompson’s air-fried chips are indeed “as good as deep-fried ones”, but I would also say, from my own experience, that air‑fried chicken wings will probably never quite hit the spot. And really, if you are going to have fried chicken, you may as well make it really good fried chicken. I will be sad to wave goodbye to the Ninja. I can see it being very useful for all sorts of stuff – even if the one thing I wouldn’t actually use it for is frying. It does make a lovely boiled egg, though.",Lifestyle/Food,"Air fryers: miraculous kitchen must-have, or just a load of hot air?",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/15/air-fryers-miraculous-kitchen-must-have-or-just-a-load-of-hot-air
2/15/2022,"The Six Nations can feel very different on home soil, particularly with crowds back. Which is why France should not start celebrating any title wins yet, with trips to Murrayfield and Cardiff set to test whether they are indeed the real deal. Let’s just say, though, that the signs are ominous for their remaining opponents. Unlike some past France sides, the current group do not fade in the closing stages and are way more organised defensively. Their first try against Ireland, scored by Antoine Dupont and beautifully created by Romain Ntamack’s offload, was a classic example of the presence of mind and smart support the half-backs offer each other. Gabin Villière on the wing has been outstanding, Damian Penaud has not been far behind and Melvyn Jaminet looks unlikely to miss too many goal-kicks over the next month. And we haven’t even mentioned the inexhaustible Gregory Alldritt and the dynamism of the front five in front of him. A lesser side than Ireland would probably have folded completely.  The flickers of attacking sharpness shown in Rome offered some succour to England’s supporters after their Murrayfield disappointment. Marcus Smith again seized the chance to impress and there is obvious potential in the 10-9-8 axis of him, Harry Randall and Alex Dombrandt. But to watch England score seven points in the final 35 minutes against inferior opposition was to be reminded how far they still have to go to become a consistently tip-top side. In perfect conditions New Zealand would have scored 60 plus points: so much for the ruthless “finishers” adding second-half oomph. On the other hand England’s next two games are at Twickenham where they take a bit of beating and with Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes due back they will also have some added crunch available. The big decision is what to do at scrum-half against Wales on Saturday week: does Eddie Jones start Ben Youngs for his record-breaking 115th England Test appearance or stick with Randall, a former Wales age-group international? A delicate call but, in all respects, now is the time for England to look forwards. There is no shame, clearly, in losing narrowly to a very good side in Paris. In many ways their gallant fightback also underlined how tough they remain to put away. But there is a broader question: how are they going to beat France at next year’s World Cup if they are falling just short now? With or without Johnny Sexton on the pitch, it never really felt as though France were likely to lose and Mack Hansen’s brilliantly taken try will not be allowed to happen every week. With Italy next up at home, it surely makes sense to give James Hume and Robert Baloucoune a run and do whatever is necessary to ensure that Sexton, Tadhg Furlong, Tadhg Beirne and Josh van der Flier are in the best possible nick for the visit to England next month. Win that and a final weekend title surge will be perfectly possible. Scotland’s season goes to show how tight the Six Nations has become. Just as a couple of well-executed pieces of skill can turn a game, as England found to their cost at Murrayfield, a lacklustre 20 minutes can also lose one. Everything was set up for Scotland to put Wales away in Cardiff but, for whatever reason, nothing happened when they put their foot to the floor. More dynamism is required up front before they can think about blowing France away at Murrayfield and Cameron Redpath could give their midfield an extra dimension. On the plus side, Darcy Graham’s footwork has been one of the joys of ttournament and Finn Russell rarely has two quiet games in a row. As an aside, is there a way to enhance the deliberate knock-on law? We have all seen enough of Russell – remember the 38-38 draw in Twickenham? – to know he was going for an interception in Cardiff in the incident that earned him a yellow card. The cynical, deliberate slapdown is a totally different beast but, either way, Wales fully deserved their win. Gloom one day, elation the next. Just another normal campaign for Wayne Pivac’s side who were clearly motivated to show there is more to them than their opening game flop in Dublin suggested. The question is whether they can bottle the same spirit and transport it along the M4 for the game against England. They have enjoyed one or two great days at Twickenham but have not won there in the Six Nations since 2012. Much will depend on the impact their back-row make with and without the ball, the ability of Tomas Francis and friends to hold fast in the scrums and Dan Biggar’s tactical nous. Louis Rees-Zammit has had a quiet tournament and is due a fizzing contribution at some stage; less flashy but increasingly valuable has been the hard-working Nick Tompkins in midfield. England are unlikely to have victory served up on a platter. The good news is that England scored their fewest number of points against the Azzurri since 2013. And Italy’s under-20s beat England, a result that will help to restore some much-needed faith. The bad is that the scoreboard does not lie. Italy have never previously been rendered scoreless in this fixture and must now go to the Aviva Stadium, one of their least happy hunting grounds. Their young side are developing but this looks to be another punishing tournament. World Rugby officials are trying to set up November fixtures that will give Italy the chance of winning a game or two but the Six Nations remains an unforgiving playground.

2/15/2022,"Since 2009, each episode of this enjoyable podcast has covered a new old curio. There are episodes about The A-Team, Tetris, Candid Camera, Zork, the McRib sandwich and the Atari Jaguar. Nostalgia podcasts have a habit of being goofy, half-remembered affairs, but Retroist host Garry Vander Voort presents each episode like a personal essay, folding in his own memories of the subjects with meticulous research. There should really be a Retroist TV show – but until that gets made, you can lose yourself for weeks in the podcast’s archives.  This is a podcast all about retro gaming. Since gaming is such a constantly evolving beast – and since entire libraries of games are lost with each new console iteration – Canadian standup Adam Blank is smart not to tie himself to a certain era. Some episodes revolve round early Mario titles, others are as recent as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City or the Rock Band series. Blank’s enthusiasm (positive and negative) for these games is unmistakable. If you were there at the time, this podcast is an absolute treat. For a while in 2017, Missing Richard Simmons was, well, unmissable. A Daily Show producer named Dan Taberski noticed that Simmons, a celebrity fitness instructor who had been a mainstay of American culture in the 1980s, had vanished from public view. Over the course of the podcast’s six-episode run, he sought to find out why. And while the show itself is grippingly told, it also raised wider issues that investigative podcasts in general are still reckoning with. Was this an invasion of privacy? What duty of care do podcasters have for their subjects? At what point do listeners start to become actively complicit? A fascinating, knotty listen. You could pretty much pick any TV show out of the ether and you’d be guaranteed to find a podcast about it. However, there’s something about Lost that lends itself especially well to retrospective analysis. In The LOST Boys, Jack Shepherd and Jacob Stolworthy dissect the entire series episode by episode; Stolworthy is a fan with multiple rewatches under his belt, while Shepherd is seeing it all for the first time. They work together wonderfully, with Shepherd’s theories and criticisms puncturing Stolworthy’s fervent proselytising. Super 90’s Bros, a podcast where two friends giddily reminisce about 90s culture, is about as far from scholarly as podcasting gets. Still, the sheer power of enthusiasm the hosts Brennon Poynor and Adam Pitzler have for some of these subjects makes this perhaps the most accessible of this bunch. It’s a cliche, but this is just like listening to your friends laugh and squabble about the half-forgotten things you all enjoyed as kids.",Arts/Culture,"Nostalgia, ultra: the best podcasts on all things retro",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/15/nostalgia-ultra-the-best-podcasts-on-all-things-retro
2/15/2022,"Russia’s defence ministry has announced it is to withdraw some of its troops from the border with Ukraine in a possible de-escalation of the threat of a potential invasion. The size of the withdrawal remains unclear and may involve only a fraction of Russia’s forces at the Ukrainian border, which western officials estimate at more than 60% of the country’s ground forces.  The announcement of the withdrawal came in a statement from the defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov, who described ongoing exercises that involved forces from “practically all military districts, fleets, and the airborne forces”. “Units of the southern and western military districts, which have accomplished their missions, are boarding trains and trucks and will head for their garrisons later today,” Konashenkov said in the statement. The defence ministry also released a video of Russian tanks and other heavy weaponry being loaded on to railway cars, the Interfax news service reported. Russia’s rouble currency reportedly posted gains following the announcement, indicating that investors hoped this would mark the beginning of a de-escalation of tensions between Russia and the west. Russia has previously announced the conclusion of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, but social media and satellite photography taken in the following days have not shown considerable changes to Russia’s force posture. Those exercises involved only a small number of troops. Many of the troops located close to the Ukrainian border are not involved in any formal training. When questioned on the buildup, Russia has said it has the right to move troops as it wishes within its own territory. Russia is holding large joint exercises with Belarus scheduled to end on 20 February. Western countries have warned that those drills could be used as cover to prepare for an attack on Ukraine, while Russia has said those troops will return to base once the exercises have concluded. Russian government officials moved quickly to accuse the west of hysteria and argue that the withdrawal of troops showed that Nato warnings of an invasion were spurious. “15 February 2022 will go into history as the day western war propaganda failed,” Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, wrote in a Facebook post after the announcement. “They have been disgraced and destroyed without a single shot being fired.”",News/World news,Russia says it will withdraw some of its troops from Ukraine border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/russia-ukraine-border-troops-withdrawal
2/15/2022,"Coco MellorsFourth Estate, £14.99, 384pp  New York City at the start of the 21st-century – pre-financial crisis, pre-Trump, pre-Covid – is captured with near-devotional lushness in this nostalgic debut. It’s an urban playground that struggling painter Cleo, 24 years old and stylishly British, is on the brink of being exiled from, her student visa due to expire in mere months, when she meets Frank, a fortysomething ad agency owner with a nice line in elevator chitchat. They wed on a whim to calamitous effect on both sides. In terms of depth, this novel is more Jay McInerney than Hanya Yanagihara, but Mellors proves herself a poetic chronicler of inky gloom as well as twinkly surfaces. Edited by Angelica MalinSquare Peg, £14.99, 176pp Sadly, the personal essay is not the established literary genre here that it is in the US, but while this patchy collection doesn’t exactly exceed expectations, it does nevertheless gesture to the potential richness of the female experience of being unattached. Yes, there are tears – heck, there are Fleetwood Mac lyrics – but you’ll also find calls to broaden the definition of romance, to quit thinking of single life as mere prologue and to wonder whether the reason we’re taught to fear going solo might perhaps be that it makes us so very powerful. Try not to mind mantras of “self-care” and tending your inner child and turn instead to essays by Mia Levitin and Rosie Wilby. Laura GallowayAllen & Unwin, £8.99, 304pp (paperback) When Manhattanite Galloway accepted delivery of a dozen red roses from her husband one morning, she was thrilled. Then she spotted the divorce papers taped to them. Not long after, she leapt with her two cats into the ultimate void: a Sami community in the Arctic north, a place of whiteness and silence where she’s so clueless about daily life, she doesn’t even know what to worry about. This compulsive account of her time there occasionally falls back on self-help tropes, but not even talk of “soul level” connections and pet psychics can obscure the bracing wonder of its setting, a place that becomes not just her refuge but also her teacher.

2/15/2022,"The UK labour market was hit by two big shocks towards the end of 2021 – the end of the government’s furlough scheme and the arrival of the Omicron variant. The good news from the latest official data is both were negotiated without the feared lengthening of the dole queues. Employment is up, job vacancies are at a new record high and the unemployment rate is down.  The bad news is that the challenge posed by rising inflation looks like it will prove to be a tricker hurdle to surmount than the end of the furlough or the restrictions that were imposed by the four nations of the UK in response to Omicron. When the Bank of England held off from raising interest rates last November it did so because it wanted to judge the impact of ending wage subsidies. The evidence is now in: there is nothing in the latest figures to stay the hand of Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee. Borrowing costs have been raised at the MPC’s last two meetings and will go up again. The tightness of the labour market means average earnings are rising at an annual rate of more than 4%. That’s because demand for workers as businesses recover exceeds supply. The number of people in employment is more than 500,000 below its pre-pandemic level, largely due to a fall in self-employment. Older workers have left the workforce, many of them on health grounds. This combination of factors means employees are in a stronger bargaining position than they might have expected a year ago, when the economy was locked down and the furlough still in place. But earnings would need to rise by even more to keep pace with rising prices. Inflation hit a 30-year high of 5.4% in December and will rise still further over the coming months, which means the squeeze on real incomes will intensify. In the circumstances, workers will seek to protect their living standards by asking for higher pay. That pressure will be sufficient to make the Bank of England nervous about a wage-price spiral, but not strong enough to compensate employees when the cost of living exceeds 7% in the spring.",News/Business,Inflation may pose a tougher challenge than the end of Covid restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/15/inflation-uk-economy-may-pose-a-tougher-challenge-than-the-end-of-covid-restrictions
