3/27/2022,"Trump's mood ""soured"" when Kemp said he had already picked Loeffler for the Senate, per a new book. According to AJC reporter Greg Bluestein, Trump met with Kemp and Loeffler in a private DC meeting. Kemp's decision to tap Loeffler for the Senate didn't clear the field of Republican candidates. In November 2019, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia flew on a private plane with businesswoman Kelly Loeffler and presidential confidant Nick Ayers to meet with then-President Donald Trump about the Senate vacancy that would soon be created by then-GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson's retirement. Kemp was tasked with selecting a replacement, and he quickly zeroed in on Loeffler for several reasons, largely due to her rural roots, conservatism, and the governor's belief that she could attract female voters to the GOP in the fast-growing Atlanta suburbs. Before the group left to meet with Trump in Washington, the governor settled on Loeffler for the appointment, bypassing the conservative favorite, Rep. Doug Collins. When the then-president met with Kemp and Loeffler and discovered that the governor had already made up his mind, his demeanor became icy, according to a new book by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution political reporter Greg Bluestein. Trump came into the meeting thinking he was going to be a part of the conservation about the appointment, and Kemp's decision to keep the selection process outside of the former president's orbit didn't win the governor any favors, as Bluestein detailed in ""Flipped: How Georgia Turned Purple and Broke the Monopoly on Republican Power."" Trump pointed out that Loeffler could be a ""star"" one day, but pivoted back to Kemp's spotty level of communication. ""I haven't heard a lot from you — is your mind made up?"" he asked Kemp during the discussion. The governor was honest with Trump and said that Loeffler was his pick to join the Senate. ""In an instant, the mood soured,"" Bluestein wrote as he described Trump's reaction. ""Kemp made a tactical error by not giving Trump reason to believe he had input."" Trump then reportedly needled Kemp about why he decided to fly to Maryland in the first place. ""If you already made the decision ... then why are you even here?"" Trump said, according to the book. Bluestein wrote that the rest of the discussion was described by individuals with knowledge of the talk as a ""full-throated confrontation"" and a ""super-aggressive job interview."" Trump pressed Kemp about why he didn't pick Collins — who had gained prominence as one of the then-president's staunchest allies on Capitol Hill — and then asked the governor how the party would retain the seat in the upcoming election. However, Trump wasn't thrilled with many of Kemp's responses, according to the book. ""Kemp did his best to answer, but it didn't placate the president,"" Bluestein wrote. ""As the meeting closed, Trump said tersely: 'Good luck. Good luck, Governor.'"" Insider reached out to representatives of Trump for comment. In December 2019, Kemp formally announced Loeffler's appointment to the Senate and sought to reassure conservatives by pointing to her strong support of gun rights and a border wall at the US-Mexico border. However, divisions at the Georgia State Capitol remained apparent. Many Republicans — including state House Speaker David Ralston — were allies of Collins and wanted to see him compete for the seat. And Collins himself teased a Senate run that very day while Loeffler was still giving her introductory speech in Atlanta, according to Bluestein. ""From the outset, it was obvious that Loeffler was determined not to give Collins even a smidgeon of an opening to run to her right,"" the book said. ""Neither her public embrace of Trump nor her promise to dig deep into her bank account scared off the congressman."" He added: ""In the days since Trump's disastrous meeting with Kemp became public, the pro-Collins crowd had only tried harder to sully the appointee's image before she had time to shape the public's opinion."" Loeffler joined the Senate in January 2020 and Collins launched his Senate bid that same month. Both candidates went on to compete in a multiparty special election in November 2020; the top-two vote-getters were Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock and Loeffler, who edged out Collins. Warnock went on to defeat Loeffler in a January 2021 Senate runoff election, winning 51%-49%. Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Trump's mood 'soured' after Georgia Gov.

3/27/2022,"Three Texas teenagers were indicted on assault charges following the assault of their football teammate. Cole Hagan was brutally beaten at a party with his friends. He suffered multiple brain bleeds and skull fractures. The Hagan family is suing the families of the teenagers involved for $50 million in damages. Three teenagers were indicted by a Texas grand jury on second-degree assault charges after their football teammate was jumped and severely beaten. Cole Hagan, 16 at the time, was at a pool party in Lake Jackson, Texas on December 3 when Logan Huber and Ayden Holland, his peers from Brazoswood High School, lured him outside, according to a police affidavit, Insider previously reported. Once outside, Hagan, a high school junior, was ambushed by his varsity football teammate 17-year-old Reid Mitchell, who had planned the attack for several days, according to witness statements given to police. Mitchell, Huber, and Holland were indicted by a grand jury in Brazoria County, Texas, on felony aggravated assault in the second degree on Thursday. Loren Klitsas, the Hagan family's attorney, told Insider the three teens face a sentencing possibility of two to 20 years. Cole's father, Mark Hagan, told Insider that it has been ""a very stressful time"" waiting on the indictments, which have come four months after Cole was brutally attacked. ""It was a sense of relief, just to put it mildly,"" Hagan told Insider. ""We're just really appreciative of the district attorney's office. They've been working hard to get the indictments out. It's been a big relief for the family."" Attorney Steve Gonzalez, representing Holland, did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. In December, Huber told police that he witnessed ""Reid Mitchell punch (Cole Hagan), bear hug him, slam him to the ground and then get on top of him and elbow him in the face,"" according to the affidavit. Two of Hagan's friends found him ""laying in the street bleeding from his ears,"" per the affidavit. He was hospitalized with multiple brain bleeds, skull fractures, and a broken collarbone, and he was put on a ventilator. Hagan had hopes of playing college football, but he'll ""probably never play football again,"" his brother previously told Insider. In December, the Hagan family filed a lawsuit against 16 people, seeking an excess of $50 million in damages and naming several of Hagan's peers and their parents, who the lawsuit said ""knew or should have known of the plan to attack Cole Hagan."" ""We're moving forward on the civil side,"" Klitsas told Insider on Saturday. ""We have depositions coming up and things like that. And fortunately, these guys got indicted, and the criminal side will go get them.""
