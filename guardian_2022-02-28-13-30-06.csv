2/28/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith’s SAS comrade saw him kick an unarmed, handcuffed Afghan man off a cliff before ordering subordinate soldiers to drag the severely injured man under a tree where he was shot dead by another soldier, the federal court has heard. “I saw the individual’s face strike a large rock and sustain a serious injury. It knocked out a number of his teeth including his front teeth,” the soldier told the court. “I was in shock.” In emotional and dramatic evidence, the former SAS soldier, who was on the patrol led by Roberts-Smith, testified to the alleged killing of the unarmed man in the village of Darwan in 2012. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing, including the alleged unlawful killing in Darwan. The former soldier was anonymised before court as Person 4. He was a witness called by the newspapers under force of subpoena. The court heard on 11 September 2012, Roberts-Smith’s patrol was involved in an operation in Darwan, in Uruzgan province, seeking a rogue Afghan soldier called Hekmatullah, who had killed three Australian troops. Hekmatullah was not found in the village. Person 4 told the court towards the end of the mission, the Australian troops encountered a man in a compound. He said the man was not armed and had a donkey loaded with firewood. Witnesses in Afghanistan, who gave evidence in the newspapers’ defence last year, named the man as Ali Jan. They told the court he was a farmer visiting Darwan from a neighbouring village. Person 4 said the man was taken into custody, his hands cuffed behind his back, and placed inside the compound facing a wall. He said Roberts-Smith took charge of questioning the detained man. Shortly after, according to Person 4 the Australian troops received communications to move to their extraction point, to be removed from the village by helicopter. Person 4, as he moved to the corner of another compound, looked back towards where the man had been detained. He told the court he saw the detained man, still handcuffed, now outside the compound standing above a “long, steep slope”, being held there by another soldier, known before court as Person 11. “At the same time I noticed Ben Roberts-Smith. He had walked to a position maybe three or four metres away. As I was trying to understand [what was happening] he turned around and walked forward and kicked the individual in the chest. “[Person 11] was still holding the individual – the individual was catapulted backwards and fell down the slope.” Person 4 said he watched the man fall and hit a large rock. He gave evidence that he followed Roberts-Smith and Person 11 down a track system that led to a dry creek bed, where the man had landed. “I was in shock … it was something I had never encountered before … seeing that individual go over the side.” The man was still alive when the soldiers reached the creek bed, Person 4 told the court. “The individual was quite dusty and had sustained a serious facial injury. As we were approaching that individual, he attempted to sit up and then fell back down again.” Person 4 told the court Roberts-Smith ordered him and Person 11 to drag the man across the creek bed under a tree, an order Person 4 told the court he followed. The detained Afghan man was standing up, when Person 4 said he began to walk away towards the helicopter landing zone. He said he was four or five metres away, and heard Roberts-Smith and Person 11 speaking, but could not discern what they were saying. He heard “two or three rounds” fired from a suppressed M4 rifle and turned to see Person 11 with his weapon lifted to his shoulder “still in a position to shoot”. The detained Afghan had been shot. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 4 said Roberts-Smith then told Person 4 to give him the camera he was carrying, allegedly saying “we need to take some photos”. Person 4 was shown photographs in court of a man’s body with an “ICOM” – a radio used by insurgents to communicate – next to it. Person 4 identified it as the man he had seen kicked off the cliff. Person 4 testified the slain man was not carrying a radio “to my knowledge”. He told the court he believed the radio, because it was wet, had come from the body of another man, earlier killed in battle by Roberts-Smith, after Roberts-Smith had swum solo across a river to engage him. Person 4 told the court that back at the Australians’ barracks Roberts-Smith had spoken to the patrol and said: “this is what the story is”. Person 4 testified Roberts-Smith said: “the story is we engaged a spotter whilst moving to our HLZ [helicopter landing zone].” Roberts-Smith has consistently denied he unlawfully killed anybody on operation at any time, and specifically during the mission in Darwan. In his evidence he told the court that he and a comrade had encountered the man purported to be Ali Jan as they were climbing an embankment to be “extracted” from Darwan by helicopter. The man had been carrying a radio, refused an order to stop and was lawfully “engaged”, Roberts-Smith said. He claims he was a legitimate target shot dead in a firefight, in accordance with the laws of war. Roberts-Smith maintained he could not have killed the man as alleged because there was no cliff from which to kick him. “There was no cliff … there was no kick,” he told the court. Person 4 remains in the witness box.

2/28/2022,"The indie drama Coda has won big at this year’s Screen Actors Guild awards, picking up best ensemble in a movie and best supporting actor for Troy Kotsur, who is the first ever deaf actor to win an individual SAG award. The Apple drama about a deaf family was bought for $25m from last year’s Sundance film festival and has also been nominated for three Academy Awards, including best picture. “This validates the fact that we deaf actors can work like anyone else,” star Marlee Matlin said. “We look forward to more opportunities for deaf actors.” Kotsur saw off competition from Kodi Smit-McPhee, Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper and Jared Leto to win the best supporting male actor category and make history as the first deaf winner of a SAG award for an individual. “Now I feel I’m finally part of the family,” Kotsur said in his speech, which was also signed. “I know you all are artists, and I know you all know what it’s like to be a starving actor. Back then I used to sleep in my car, I slept in my dressing room backstage, I couch-surfed and all of that. You feel me, right? So thank you so much.” Will Smith also won his first SAG award – best male actor in a leading role – for playing Richard Williams in tennis drama King Richard. He called the father of Venus and Serena “a dreamer like no one you’ve ever known”, saying it was his “deepest pleasure” to share their story with the world. Jessica Chastain beat out Nicole Kidman, Lady Gaga and Olivia Colman to win best lead female actor in a movie for televangelist biopic The Eyes of Tammy Faye. “It was a dream of mine to play Tammy Faye,” Chastain said. “I worked on the project for 10 years and I hope we made the story in a way that she would be proud of.” She continued: “I love my artistic family and my heart is with our international family who is all around the world right now and fighting for their safety and their freedom.” The Netflix phenomenon Squid Game was another big and historic winner of the night, becoming the first foreign language series to win small screen awards by picking up best male and female actor in a drama series for Lee Jung-Jae and Jung Ho-Yeon. But the best drama ensemble award went to the acclaimed third season of HBO’s Succession. Brian Cox spent the latter part of his speech paying tribute to the people of Ukraine and to his fellow actors and entertainers in Russia who have been told not to speak out against Vladimir Putin’s regime. “It’s truly, truly awful what is happening,” he said. “I think we should really join in celebrating them.” Michael Keaton was named best male actor in a limited series or TV movie for Hulu’s opioid saga Dopesick and also raised the invasion of Ukraine in his speech. “Zelenskiy deserves some credit tonight for fighting the fight,” he said before tearfully paying tribute to his nephew Michael, who died from fentanyl and heroin use. Presenter Leslie Odom Jr offered “thoughts, prayers and hope for impending peace” in Ukraine, while nominee Michael Douglas wore a pocket square with the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Apple’s hit football series Ted Lasso claimed the awards for comedy ensemble and best actor in a comedy series for Jason Sudeikis. Most of the cast were shown via video due to the production’s quarantine guidelines. Ariana DeBose was named best supporting actress for her performance in Steven Spielberg’s musical remake West Side Story. “It’s taken a long time for me to feel comfortable calling myself an actor,” she said after talking about her background in musical theatre. “I really do believe then when you recognise one of us, you recognise all of us.” Small screen winners also included Jean Smart for best female actor in a comedy series for the breakout HBO Max series Hacks. “I love actors, nobody gets us, you know?” she said in her speech. “What we do is valuable. We are the tried storytellers … and it’s important and we actually are the world’s oldest profession.” Smart’s Mare of Easttown co-star Kate Winslet also won best female actor in a limited series or TV movie for Mare of Easttown, but wasn’t at the event to accept the award. Helen Mirren brought home the SAG life achievement award, introduced by her Collateral Beauty co-star Winslet on video and Cate Blanchett in person. The76-year-old believed that her award was the result of her mantra: “Be on time and don’t be an ass.” This year’s ceremony required all attenders to provide proof of Covid-19 vaccination, at odds with next month’s Oscars. Initial reports had suggested that the Academy was requiring no proof whatsoever, but rules have since shifted. While all nominees and guests must be vaccinated, performers and presenters only need to show a negative test. Earlier this month, Yellowstone actor Forrie J Smith announced that he would be skipping the SAG awards because of the mandate. “I haven’t been vaccinated since I was a little kid. I don’t vaccinate my dogs, I don’t vaccinate my horses,” Smith said in a since deleted Instagram video. “I’ve never had a flu shot. I never will. I believe they compromise your immunities.” This year’s Academy Awards will take place on 27 March, with the nominations led by Jane Campion’s film The Power of the Dog.",Arts/Film,"Screen Actors Guild awards 2022: Squid Game, Will Smith and Coda win big",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/28/screen-actors-guild-awards-2022-squid-game-will-smith-and-coda-win-big
2/28/2022,"Tim Winton has used his closing address at Perth festival’s Writers Weekend to voice his opposition to the ongoing reliance of Western Australian arts organisations on sponsorship from the fossil fuel industry. Taking aim specifically at Woodside Energy – which is a sponsor of one of the festival’s key events, the Saturday 5 March performance of John Luther Adams’ Pulitzer prize-winning work Become Ocean – Winton, one of Australia’s most highly recognised writers, said that the “arts-washing” fossil fuel companies continued to engage in on a major scale was “straight out of the big tobacco playbook.” The work – described by the composer as a response to the effects of global warming on the world’s oceans, and set to be performed by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO) and Western Australian Youth Orchestras (WAYO) – has already become the target of protests, with the activist group Fossil Free Arts WA calling on the festival to drop the event from its program because of Woodside’s involvement. Other artists calling for the funding arrangement to be dropped included Fringe World performer Noemie Huttner-Koros, Kuruma Marthedunera woman and Murujuga traditional owner Josie Alec, and Nick Allbrook, lead singer of the band Pond, who allowed their opening night performance to be interrupted by climate activists. Stella Donnelly also spoke out against the Woodside sponsorship during her sold out Perth festival show on Friday. On Sunday evening, Winton added his voice to the protests, arguing that the arts sector’s captivity to sponsorship from giant companies such as Woodside and Chevron (a major Perth festival sponsor for almost two decades) had become “so internalised it feels normal”. “In fact, half the time we’re so punch drunk, it feels right,” he said. Winton noted that unlike the WA arts sector, the state’s financial institutions, super funds, shareholder groups and banks were severing their relationships with the fossil fuel industry in droves. “I do want us to acknowledge how things still work here … how captive [the arts and cultural sectors] are,” he told the Writers Weekend audience. “I suspect that to some of the folks who were involved in decisions around that production, all of them good people I’m sure, the dissonance just wasn’t audible. And that just shows you how normal it is, how safe the fossil giants still feel here in the wild west.” “For who else in the corporate world, sailing so close to reputational oblivion, could feel that safe and so confident? You reckon a brewery would put itself forward for a show about foetal alcohol syndrome? How about the tobacco industry sponsoring ventilators for lung patients?” Winton said he was not “sledging” the Perth festival, WASO or WAYO for its involvement with Woodside, and was not calling for a boycott of the concert. “I’m not interested in denouncing or shaming anyone in the beleaguered arts community,” Winton said. “Funding is a nightmare, and I know from long personal experience just how hard it can be to raise cash for good work, and I’m fully sympathetic. “But I do think this matter needs to be addressed, and it’s way past time, especially in this town.” Winton also pointed to the irony of Perth festival’s 2022 theme – ocean – and its longstanding sponsorship arrangement with another fossil fuel company, Chevron: “Awkward. And to be honest, really embarrassing,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Whether you’re having an oceans theme or not … Chevron? Really? With a record like theirs?” he continued. “It also shows how far and how wide and how deep we’ve let the influence of fossil capital seep through our culture, and also how bloody hard it’s going to be to extricate ourselves. Because they’re everywhere. “But what I take personally and find most disheartening is the knowledge that my own industry, the arts caper, is still so thoroughly co-opted. Just step back a moment and think about this. Artists and the companies that support them are supposed to be the guardians of the champions of the imagination … You’re falling for this old soft power ploy. It doesn’t make us bad people, but it does make us chumps.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from Chevron, the Perth festival, WASO and WAYO. In a statement, Perth festival said they were “proud” to have Winton appear at the Writers Weekend, and that “artistic freedom of expression is paramount”. “We receive support from a wide range of partners – including corporate sponsors, government supporters and philanthropists – that represent the scope of the Western Australian business sector,” the festival continued. “As a not-for-profit arts organisation, this support allows us to provide hundreds of thousands of Western Australians with world-class cultural experiences that otherwise would not happen. It also helps us to make the arts accessible to as many people as possible while delivering huge employment, social and economic benefit to WA.” A Chevron spokesperson said: “Tim Winton is a cherished Australian author and we respect his right to express his opinions … The arts community has experienced particular challenges throughout the Covid-19 pandemic due to the postponement and cancellation of events. At this difficult time, we are pleased to support Perth Festival.” A Woodside spokesperson said the company had been a “committed supporter of Western Australia’s talented young musicians” since 1991 and that 30-year relationship reached “new heights” last year, when the company connected WAYO to WASO for Dreams of Place, a series of concerts and workshops. “Through the partnership, WAYO musicians are provided with unique opportunities to learn from Western Australia’s professional state orchestra,” the spokesperson said. “A complete program of interactive workshops and rehearsals culminating in annual side-by-side performances … is helping develop our local talent, creating pathways for the next generation of gifted musicians.” Though Perth’s fringe arts festival Fringe World appeared to have divested itself from Woodside last year, it instead transitioned the sponsorship to its parent company, Artrage. Woodside also sponsors Perth theatre companies Barking Gecko and Yirra Yaakin.",Arts/Culture,‘It makes us chumps’: Tim Winton speaks out against fossil fuel sponsorship of Perth festival,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/28/it-makes-us-chumps-tim-winton-speaks-out-against-fossil-fuel-sponsorship-of-perth-festival
