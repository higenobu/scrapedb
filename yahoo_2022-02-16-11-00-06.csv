2/16/2022,"Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva had three different substances used to treat heart conditions in the sample which triggered the doping storm at the Beijing Olympics, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. Valieva learned during the Games she had tested positive in December for trimetazidine, a drug used to treat angina which also boosts endurance. On Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that she could carry on at the Olympics, but that does not mean she has been cleared of doping and she could still face punishment at a later date. The Times reported that her sample also contained the heart medications hypoxen and L-Carnatine, which are not on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list. The Times report said the disclosures concerning the different substances were contained in a document submitted at Sunday's Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing that ended with the controversial decision to allow Valieva to compete. Senior IOC member Denis Oswald told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that Valieva told the CAS hearing she tested positive because of ""contamination"" from her grandfather's medicine. Russian media reported that Valieva allegedly drank from the same glass as her grandfather, who takes trimetazidine for a heart condition. The Times report said that Valieva's grandfather had provided a pre-recorded video message to a hearing with Russian anti-doping officials on February 9 in which he said he used trimetazidine to treat ""attacks."" The athlete's grandfather showed a packet of the medication during the message. Valieva's mother told the same hearing her daughter took the substance hypoxen due to heart ""variations"", the Times report said. She added that Valieva's grandfather also accompanied the teenager to practice on a daily basis. rcw/pb",World/AFP,Valieva had multiple substances in system: report,https://news.yahoo.com/valieva-had-multiple-substances-system-205629346.html
2/16/2022,"Just under two weeks after Jeff Zucker resigned from CNN, the cable newser’s chief marketing exec Allison Gollust is out too. The news came as The New York Times published an account of the downfall of Chris Cuomo, Zucker and now Gollust at the network, something that has left staffers with anxiety and uncertainty over the network’s future, particularly with the pending combination of CNN’s parent, WarnerMedia, with Discovery, a deal expected to close next month. The Times story included more details of allegations against Cuomo, including a woman’s claim that he sexually assaulted her in 2011, when he was an anchor at ABC News and she worked as a temporary employee. More from Deadline Village Roadshow Loses Push To Speed Up 'Matrix' Suit With Warner Bros Over Streaming Strategy - Update Networks Put Teams In Place Amid Threat Of Russian Invasion Of Ukraine Warner Bros Swings Back At ""Duplicitous"" Village Roadshow Over 'Matrix' Streaming Suit WarnerMedia confirmed Gollust’s exit to Deadline after an internal memo by CEO Jason Kilar started leaking out: Earlier today, Allison Gollust resigned from CNN following the conclusion of the Company’s investigation into issues associated with Chris Cuomo and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Performed by a third-party law firm and led by a former federal judge, the investigation was comprehensive and definitive. It was commissioned in September and concluded this weekend, which now allows the company to share additional information. Based on interviews of more than 40 individuals and a review of over 100,000 texts and emails, the investigation found violations of Company policies, including CNN’s News Standards and Practices, by Jeff Zucker, Allison Gollust, and Chris Cuomo. We have the highest standards of journalistic integrity at CNN, and those rules apply to everyone equally. Kilar added in a memo to staffers, “I realize this news is troubling, disappointing, and frankly, painful to read. These are valid feelings many of you have.” Both publicly and privately, a number of CNNers have been lamenting the demise of Zucker, who resigned resigned as the president of the outlet in the morning of February 2. In his goodbye to staff, the former Today Show producer put the cause of his exit after nearly a decade at CNN on a failure to disclose what he characterized as a “consensual relationship” with a colleague. “As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years,” Zucker wrote earlier this month. “I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when I began but I didn’t. I was wrong.” Despite wanting to hold on to his gig for a bit longer, Zucker was told in no uncertain terms by Kilar in a telephone call a few days before his resignation that “you can’t remain here,” as we reported on later on February 2. The relationship was with Gollust, who had been viewed by some staffers as a potential successor to Zucker when the Discovery-WarnerMedia deal closed. After Zucker’s departure, a number of employees argued that Gollust had been unfairly tarnished by what happened, with her future at the company uncertain. Another factor looming over all this, and one that the likes of Jake Tapper and other CNN anchors brought up to Kilar after Zucker’s ouster, is the threat of legal action from the younger Cuomo. Finally fired in December last year for his closer than previously disclosed association with his sexual harassment scandalized older brother and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, the ex-CNN host is seeking at least an $18 million payout. Chris Cuomo has hired Hollywood heavyweight lawyer Bryan Freedman to represent him. Having successfully represented Megyn Kelly and Gabrielle Union-Wade in their respective battles with NBC, the Freedman & Taitelman LLP attorney sent a letter to CNN and WarnerMedia on December 6 asking for “preservation of relevant evidence.” In the one potential warning shot across the bow in an otherwise standard note, Freedman did make a point of requesting “documents including correspondence related to any appearances by Andrew Cuomo on CNN.” Best of Deadline Cancellations/Renewals Scorecard: TV Shows Ended Or Continuing In 2021-22 Season What's New On HBO Max For January 2022: Day-By-Day Listings For TV Shows & Movies New On Prime Video For January 2022: Daily Listings For Streaming TV, Movies & More Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

2/16/2022,"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) — A judge has set an April sentencing date for former reality TV star Josh Duggar, who was convicted last year of federal child pornography charges. Duggar — whose family was featured on TLC's “19 Kids and Counting” — was convicted of one count each of receiving and possessing child pornography. He faces up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 for each count. U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks on Tuesday scheduled Duggar's sentencing for April 5 in Fayetteville, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock. Federal authorities said they began investigating Duggar after a Little Rock police detective found that child porn files were being shared by a computer traced to Duggar. A federal agent testified that images depicting the sexual abuse of children, including toddlers, were downloaded in 2019 onto a computer at a car dealership Duggar owned. Duggar's attorneys have filed for a new trial or an acquittal. His trial attorneys had argued that someone else downloaded or uploaded the images onto the computer.",U.S./Associated Press,Sentencing set for Josh Duggar in federal child porn case,https://news.yahoo.com/sentencing-set-josh-duggar-federal-185930337.html
2/16/2022,"By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and its allies are prepared to respond to Russian cyberattacks amid escalating tensions over Ukraine, with the scope of retaliatory actions or sanctions depending on the severity of the hacks, U.S. and European officials said on Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking hours after Ukraine reported its defense ministry and two banks had been hacked, told reporters that Washington was coordinating closely with NATO allies and other partners to expand defenses against threats in cyberspace. The attacks, believed by Western security experts to have been carried out by Russia, were not unexpected, U.S. and European officials said, requesting anonymity. Russia's Federal Security Service did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Reuters. ""The president has said we will respond to Russian actions short of a military invasion,"" said one U.S. official. ""But what is decided depends on the extent of the cyberattacks. There are so many ranges, it's hard to go into specifics."" One European diplomat said cyberattacks were a longstanding component of Russian strategy, and had been used by Moscow in past military confrontations with Georgia and Ukraine. ""It's part of their playbook,"" the official said, underscoring Western resolve to use concerted action to hold Moscow accountable for cyberattacks and other ""misbehavior."" While U.S., European and Canadian officials have worked out a detailed package of sanctions if Russian forces invade Ukraine, there is no similarly detailed plan for how to respond to cyberattacks, the sources said. That is partly because it can take time to pinpoint who was responsible, especially in the case of distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, said the officials. DDOS attacks work by directing a fire hose of internet traffic from a multitude of sources against a server or other target. More aggressive and damaging attacks are likely to draw a fiercer response. And some countries - including France - generally prefer to avoid publicly attributing blame for cyberattacks, said one of the European officials. The response could involve actions other than sanctions, including physical or cyberattacks on servers involved, said one cyber expert familiar with Western planning. Many Russians held responsible for past cyberattacks have appeared on sanctions blacklists, but more could be added, two of the officials said. Negotiations between U.S. and European officials in recent weeks have focused more on finetuning the sanctions likely to be imposed in the event of a physical invasion - and their impact on Russia and the imposing countries - rather than mapping out a menu of options for cyberattacks, said one European official. ""There's no detailed roadmap for what do in the event of a cyberattack,"" said one European diplomat. ""That will depend on the specifics of the case.""
