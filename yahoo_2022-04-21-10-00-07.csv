4/21/2022,"Experts are warning China’s recent string of COVID-19 lockdowns is about to send another shock through global supply chains. At least 373 million people—in cities that represent roughly 40% of China’s gross domestic product—have been affected by the most recent wave of lockdowns across China, Reuters reported last week. The strict lockdowns have left some residents desperate for food and led to viral videos of Shanghai residents screaming from the windows of their high-rise apartments. And with Chinese President Xi Jinping doubling down on the country’s zero-COVID approach, what happens in China isn’t likely to stay there. Global supply chains are set to take a hit. After all, Shanghai is home to the world’s largest port, and although it has largely remained open, trucks are struggling to unload cargo due to strict permit regulations, causing shipping containers to stack up. “Even with air and ocean ports open, the length of the shutdown could make this iteration the most significant logistics disruption since the start of the pandemic,” the shipping company Freightos said in an update to clients this week. That’s rough news for the American consumer, given the fact that the U.S. imported more goods from China than anywhere else in the world over the past decade. In 2020 alone, the U.S imported roughly $435 billion worth of goods from Chinese cities and sent another $125 billion to the country in exports, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. That means, once lockdowns end, there’s going to be an “overwhelming movement of goods” that cripples supply chains, Jon Monroe, an ocean shipping and supply-chain expert who runs Jon Monroe Consulting, told FreightWaves on Friday. “It’s probably worse than Wuhan. You’re going to have a lot of pent-up orders,” he said. Lars Jensen, the CEO of the shipping industry adviser Vespucci Maritime, said that he doesn’t see any immediate end in sight to production and logistics disruptions in China either. “The supply-chain situation in Shanghai continues to worsen. The port is running out of capacity for some types of cargo as importers cannot collect their goods,” Jensen wrote in a Friday post. “With the outbreak in Guangzhou also leading to shutdowns there, the impact on export volumes out of China will grow larger.” Investment banks are also sounding the alarm on the potential impact of the strict lockdowns in China. In a note downgrading Chinese GDP growth expectations, UBS said even more localities have initiated “de facto lockdowns” since finding COVID-19 cases. “Logistic problems were more widespread in April, leading to production disruptions in multiple industries,” the UBS team led by economist Tao Wang wrote. “This could impact China’s trade more significantly in April.” The economists added that they believe the Chinese government is unlikely to adjust its current policy anytime soon, even if officials are working to reduce transport blockages and production disruptions, meaning supply-chain chaos is likely to continue in the near term. The effects of the widespread lockdowns in China are already being felt as far as Europe, according to the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. The organization sent a letter to the Chinese government urging officials to revise their policies last week, arguing the effects of the lockdowns have already begun to affect European suppliers. A flash survey from the German Chamber of Commerce in China conducted in the first week of April found that roughly half of German companies' logistics, warehousing, and supply-chain operations were ""completely disrupted or severely impacted by the current COVID-19 situation in China,"" Reuters reported.

4/21/2022,"A court in Japan posthumously returned 45 cents to a train driver after deducting the money from his payroll because he caused a one-minute delay in 2020.

The Okayama District Court ordered the West Japan Railway Co. on Tuesday to pay the train driver, who demanded 2.2 million yen (approximately $17,065) compensation for emotional distress in March 2021.

The train driver, who was in his 50s, died from an illness earlier this year.

In June 2020, the train driver reportedly waited for an empty train at the wrong platform, causing a two-minute delay. West Japan Railway Co. then deducted 85 yen (approximately 66 cents) from the driver’s payroll. However, the company reduced it to a one-minute delay after the Okayama labor standards inspection office became involved and deducted 45 cents instead.

The train driver then attempted to sue West Japan Railway Co. in March 2021, but was unsuccessful.

Judge Hisanori Okuno ruled on Tuesday that the train driver would be posthumously compensated after concluding that the man immediately recognized and corrected his mistake. Okuno stated if an employee spends their work hours correcting a mistake related to a task, they must still be paid for services rendered.

In March, West Japan Railway Co. revised their policy in which any mistakes caused by a train delay would constitute a pay deduction and count as time not worked. The company added that they were planning the revision before the lawsuit occurred and “sincerely accepts the ruling.” Enjoy this content? Read more from NextShark!

4/21/2022,"(This April 19 story refiles to correct Pentagon comments to say no fixed wing aircraft were provided to Ukraine) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukraine's military has increased the size of its fleet of fixed-wing aircraft after receiving spare parts and repairing damaged aircraft, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. Ukraine has defied expectations of allies and military experts by not only keeping its air force operational nearly two months after the start of Russia's invasion but actually repairing aircraft and, apparently, adding to its inventory. On Tuesday Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine had received additional aircraft as well as parts, but clarified on Wednesday that no fixed-wing aircraft had been provided so far to Ukraine's military. Kyiv has repeatedly requested combat aircraft to help it repel invading Russian forces. ""I was in error in saying that, in past tense, they have been given whole aircraft. I regret the error,"" Kirby said on Wednesday. ""That said, the Ukrainians have received -- through United States' coordination and provision -- enough spare parts and additional equipment such that they have been able to put in operation more fixed-wing aircraft in their fleet than they had even two to three weeks ago."" The United States has announced plans to transfer Russian-made helicopters to Ukraine that had once been intended for Afghanistan. More than 50 days into the war, the skies over Ukraine are still contested in part due to Ukraine's fleet of aircraft and air defenses, including portable, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles provided by the United States and its allies. That has allowed Ukraine to wage a much more effective ground campaign than if Russia had air dominance and could defend its invading forces from the skies.
