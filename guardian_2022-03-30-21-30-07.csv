3/30/2022,"Shares in Pearson slumped by as much as 12% after Apollo said it would not make another bid for the educational publisher after having a third offer valuing the company at £7.2bn, including debt, rejected earlier this week. Investors sent shares in Pearson – whose market value rose by a fifth after the US private equity group revealed it was considering sweetening a second £6.4bn offer that was snubbed earlier this month – plunging, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on Wednesday. Apollo made a third offer on Monday, a combination of cash and an agreement to pay out the company’s previously announced dividend to shareholders, valuing the company at 884.2p. The offer values the business at £6.7bn, while Pearson also has about £500m in net debt, giving an enterprise value of £7.2bn. Investors, unhappy at the deal going cold, wiped as much as £750m off the market value of the education group, which had a stock market capitalisation of £5.95bn at the close of trading on Tuesday. “The board of Pearson considered the third proposal, together with its financial advisers, and concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects,” the company said. “Accordingly, the board of Pearson unanimously rejected the third proposal.” Apollo responded with a statement saying it does not intend to make a fourth offer. Under UK takeover rules, Apollo cannot revisit a potential takeover of Pearson for six months unless the educational company’s board agrees – or a third-party emerges with a bid. “Apollo notes that it has been unable to reach agreement with the board of Pearson as to the terms of an offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Pearson,” the company said. “Accordingly, Apollo confirms that it does not intend to make an offer for Pearson.” Earlier this month, Pearson’s board confirmed it had unanimously rejected an 854.2p offer made on 7 March saying it “significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects”. It also revealed that it had rejected an all-cash offer of 800p in November. Interest in Pearson, which counts Europe’s largest activist investor Cevian as its biggest shareholder with a 10% stake, comes as the company is finally emerging from a seven-year slump marked by a string of profit warnings and a record £2.6bn loss. Pearson has been on a steady recovery path since being caught out by the seismic shift of students in the US, its biggest market, away from buying its new academic titles to snapping up secondhand titles and ebooks. The shift to a digital-first model began under its previous chief executive, John Fallon, who stepped down in 2020 after almost eight years. Its new head, Andy Bird, the former chair of Walt Disney’s operations, has doubled down on that approach, launching a Netflix-style subscription service called Pearson+ at the heart of the company’s strategy. Last year, Apollo sold McGraw Hill, a rival US-headquartered textbook publisher and education company, to Platinum Equity for $4.5bn.

3/30/2022,"There are two or three or possibly four laughs in Judd Apatow’s extremely long Netflix comedy about movie celebrity and the pandemic, which features a range of American and British talent. The troubled cast members of a hugely successful action franchise called Cliff Beasts are persuaded to reunite for Cliff Beasts 6: to beat the virus they’ll all have to bubble up for a three-month shoot in a huge English country hotel where greenscreen facilities can be erected to fabricate the real world outside. These comprise insecure Carol (Karen Gillan), haughty diva Lauren (Leslie Mann), bleary veteran Dustin (David Duchovny), spiritual wellness enthusiast Sean (Keegan-Michael Key), TikTok superstar Krystal (Iris Apatow), light relief Howie (Guz Khan) and borderline-crazy Dieter (Pedro Pascal). They have to be kept in line by their tightlipped Brit producer (Peter Serafinowicz) and visionary director Darren (Fred Armisen). Periodically, there are some nice gags about the heartless world of showbusiness; Carol’s agent (played by Rob Delaney) tells her that the industry always blames the stars for underperforming movies. “Judi Dench fucked Cats!” Kate McKinnon is on amusingly icy form as the chillingly unsympathetic studio head. There are also some nicely surreal scenes showing how very easy it is to fake an exterior location digitally: the cast free-climb a high mountain, but tired and bored, they start petulantly floating away on their invisible wires. This could have been a good premise, but the basic idea of the pandemic and bubbling up itself now feels spurious and dated, and there just aren’t enough funny lines to carry this film through its punishing 126-minute running time.

3/30/2022,"War, slave labour, concentration camps and life as a refugee: having survived such hardships, it is no wonder Yugoslavian musician Branko Mataja was happy to live quietly in a Los Angeles suburb and build custom guitars for the likes of Johnny Cash and Geddy Lee. His death in 2000 attracted no obituaries and his 1973 LP Traditional and Folk Songs of Yugoslavia remained unsung. Mataja had lived under the radar, a musician seemingly playing only for himself. Now, almost half a century later, his music is finally being reissued and it is causing quite a stir. “What Branko did was unlike what anyone else was doing at the time,” says David Jerkovich, a 43-year-old American musician who is the force getting Mataja’s music heard. “His playing has this kind of outsider, intense quality and it’s just so unique to him. And his studio technique is incredible – he bounced and overdubbed sound in a manner no one else even approached.” Jerkovich was cratedigging in a Hollywood used record store in 2005 when he came across a copy of Traditional and Folk Songs of Yugoslavia, priced at $7. “He just looked so badass on the cover that I had to buy it,” Jerkovich says. “I was buying Yugoslav-era music as my parents are from Croatia – I’m a first-generation American – and I was wanting to gain a greater understanding of their musical roots. I got home and put it on the stereo and …” He pauses, then says: “It’s unlike anything I’d ever heard before. What Branko has done is take these ancient melodies and built something very abstract, very beautiful, out of them.” Traditional and Folk Songs of Yugoslavia was released on a tiny label; Jerkovich thinks it was likely a self-financed release. This and recordings Mataja issued on cassette a decade later are gathered on the new compilation Over Fields and Mountains, an album of sublime, spooky beauty: ambient electric guitar soundscapes that bear comparison to what John Fahey, Robbie Basho, John Renbourn and even Dick Dale achieved, having incorporated melodies and tunings from folk, blues, Indian and Arabic music. Jerkovich also emphasises that Mataja’s experiments with tape delay and overdub techniques are groundbreaking and akin to what Lee “Scratch” Perry and Brian Eno would later develop. “He layered all these different sounds he was creating on a four-track recorder with remarkable skill and imagination,” notes Jerkovich. “I find Branko’s music a little psychedelic, even though I know that wasn’t his scene.” Who, Jerkovich found himself asking, was this mysterious musician? Mataja (1923-2000) was born in the small coastal town of Bekar, then part of Dalmatia, now Croatia, before his family relocated to Belgrade. It was here 10-year-old Branko built his first guitar. During the second world war, Axis forces occupied Yugoslavia and the teenager was forcibly conscripted to Germany to work as slave labour. After American soldiers liberated the concentration camp he was held in, Branko hustled for the US army as a cook, barber, and pedlar of cigarettes, candy and nylons. He also played guitar in bars US soldiers frequented. Finding the US quota for refugees full and wary of returning to Yugoslavia, Mataja was accepted as a refugee by the UK: he initially lived in a displaced persons camp in Yorkshire. Here he met and married a Montenegrin refugee, Roksanda Radonjic. The Matajas became British citizens before emigrating to Canada in 1954, then in 1963 to Detroit, finally settling in Los Angeles in 1964. As long hair became fashionable and barbers struggled, Mataja was determined to focus on his first love: working on guitars. He spent long hours in his workshop, and having taught himself electrical engineering and built a home studio he began recording himself. The only time he left his workshop for any amount of time was, apparently, to watch the World Cup. He had a son, Bata, who grew up to be a successful businessman supplying customised cars to the film industry. “Branko could be seen to have lived the proverbial American dream,” Jerkovich says. “Dad loved to share his music,” says Bata. “If people came around the house he would play for them and they’d go ‘wow’. But what he played was popular songs of the 1940s – Nat King Cole, Django Reinhardt, that kind of music. I’m surprised he recorded these old Balkan songs because I don’t recall him playing such.” Bata also admits to being surprised when Jerkovich and his friend Doug Mcgowan tracked him down and declared themselves enamoured with his late father’s music. Mcgowan works for Numero Group, a US specialist reissue label, but Bata refused his entreaties to license Branko’s recordings. “Bata was busy with his own business,” says Jerkovich, “and didn’t see the point in us reissuing Branko’s music. He did give us what turned out to be Branko’s second album, Folk Songs of Serbia – which he had self-released on cassette in the mid-1980s and we had no idea of – and informed us about his father’s life, but it took 13 years before he finally came around.” Having retired, Bata finally relented and Jerkovich, who runs an LA recording studio, salvaged the now damaged master tapes. It is unlikely we will ever understand why Mataja radically re-contextualised the songs of his childhood; he never returned to Yugoslavia and had no interest in the sectarian divisions that shattered the nation. “Maybe he was trying to connect with his mother,” Bata suggests; Jerkovich wonders if Mataja was trying to forge a sonic connection with a land he was torn away from as a teenager. The haunted atmospheres his music conjures allow for all kinds of interpretations. Mataja was, says Bata, “very stubborn and determined, always experimenting, inventing things. And pretty intense.” Music was his father’s great love but, Bata observes, “he never thought of it as something that would make him wealthy. He just loved to make music. He was always inventing things and experimenting – he was like a mad scientist in his studio – and when he was playing guitar, he was in another world.” Visitors to his workshop might be given an LP or cassette – that was the extent of his promo. Ill health forced Mataja to stop playing guitar in the 1990s, and, depressed, he died of a heart attack in 2000. He could easily have remained unknown had a young musician not paid $7 for Branko’s LP in a Hollywood used record store. “Luckily they were persistent,” Bata says of Jerkovich and Mcgowan. “I now wish I’d done it earlier because when I hear people saying how much Dad’s music means – well, it’s very moving. I only wish Dad was alive so he could experience all the interest and enthusiasm. He told me ‘music is beautiful – it will open doors for you that you didn’t think will open’.

3/30/2022,"Who lives in a house like this? The duvet swallows people whole, what looks like a glittery armadillo is on the loose and the floor is littered with mannequins and violins. That inventory alone would suggest circus superstar James Thierrée, and in the room that is created on stage in his new spectacular he becomes a living portrait, peeking his head through a crooked rococo picture frame. Its origins predate the Covid crisis but Room will resonate with anyone who has been staring at the walls and going stir crazy. These walls even demand your attention as the set characteristically has a mind of its own: panels pulsate and rotate as the structure is assembled before us and just as swiftly exploded, with the enormous roof floating away though delicately held at one point in Thierrée’s palm. As in his shows Tabac Rouge and The Toad Knew, chaos reigns and the task at hand for his character is to create a little harmony. Tabac Rouge started with the concept of a man rehearsing a production which runs away from his control. There’s a similar storyline here, with a dash of the artistic quandaries of Fellini’s 8 1/2. One minute Thierrée is playing an architect whose building won’t behave; the next he’s a director whose performers don’t listen. It becomes a battle for authority – even his mop of silvery curls are unruly, a percussive flurry accompanying every flick of his fringe. For the first time, Thierrée has assembled a cast dominated by musicians and he has also introduced vocal acrobatics to his act. He sings and half-raps his own compositions in a production that has more text (in multiple languages) and less dance than usual. The music and movement coalesce with playful results when one member of the ensemble turns her euphonium into a monster or when Thierrée rumbles the word “room” as if summoning its construction through sheer willpower. But too often the lyrics veer from ruminative to rambling and they dispel some of the bewitching inscrutability of the visual language. The songs’ occasional sentimentality is also at odds with the persona of his puppet-master whose arc, and relationship with the central female character, seems incomplete – his tyranny is never resolved in the story’s emerging celebration of community. By design, the show resembles a work in progress – with Thierrée constantly commenting on the process as scenes begin to take shape and are then scrapped. This unpredictable, restless tone matches the spirit of rehearsals and you’re never sure what will be razed to the ground and what will rise from it. But it also leads to a disjointed rhythm, exacerbated by bursts of eclectic music (from opera to rock) and pauses that include the house lights coming on, which means that – unusually for Thierrée – it’s a show that is hard to lose yourself in. Thierrée’s trademark blend of the quotidian and the fantastical results in some delightfully nimble skits and mimes – a violin case that weighs a tonne, a music stand that traps his fingers – although some jokes grow repetitive and the production does not yet have the unity of his recent works. If the focus wavers it’s also because his character’s whims dictate the pace. In one dazzling moment, a dancer lies, limbs twisted, like a doll abandoned on a bedroom floor in favour of some other toy. That game is over, the next one’s begun – and we do our best to keep up.

3/30/2022,"Non-league Staines Town have suspended all football operations with immediate effect due to a dispute with their landlord. Making the announcement on Tuesday, the club issued an extraordinary statement in which numerous allegations were made against Downing LLP, including breaches of the modern slavery act. Downing LLP have strenuously denied what they describe as “wild allegations”, labelling them an attempt to deflect attention from mismanagement of the club by owner Joe Dixon. Staines Town sit bottom of Isthmian League Southern Central Division and are due to host Chipstead on Saturday but, as things stand, that fixture as well as all further ones this season will not be fulfilled due to the row with Downing LLP, an investment organisation that own Staines’s ground, Wheatsheaf Park, via its purchasing in 2008 of The Thames Club, the health club it is attached to. The dispute has been raging for some years and reached a climax with Tuesday’s statement. It read: “Staines Town Football Club (STFC) regrets to announce that pursuant to third party breaches of Section 54 of The Modern Slavery Act 2015 and other information that has come to light, we are forced to temporarily suspend all primary operations including but not limited to competitive fixtures, until a thorough investigation into the practices of Downing LLP has been concluded by the relevant authorities. “It has also come to our attention through both substantive and vast evidence from various sources, that Downing LLP, who control and fund the operation of our Landlord, The Thames Club, may be involved through its other holdings in the financing of large scale bribery and corruption.” The statement went on to say that the club has evidence Downing LLP “may be involved through its other holdings in the financing of Environmental Crimes, Price Fixing, Deforestation, Forced Evictions, Human Rights Abuses, Child Labour, Slavery, Gender Discrimination and Murder.” The club also accuses Downing LLP of fraud and breaching government sanctions against Russia. Downing LLP issued a statement a few hours later. It read: “The allegations published by Mr Dixon on the Staines Town Football Club (STFC) website against Downing LLP (Downing) and The Thames Club (TTC) are untrue. They would appear to be the latest attempt by Mr Dixon to deflect attention from his mismanagement of STFC over a number of years and this has left the club in a parlous financial position. “The fact that STFC is ceasing operations has nothing to do with TTC or Downing. Nor is it connected to the alleged breaches of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (Act) by Downing. This is a construct and does not bear scrutiny not least because none of Downing, TTC or indeed STFC qualify as a ‘commercial organisation’ for the purpose of the Act as they do not meet the financial thresholds set by the Secretary of State. The remainder of the wild allegations made by Mr Dixon should be viewed in the context of the above.” Responding to the dispute, the FA said: “We are aware of the statement issued by Staines Town FC.

3/30/2022,"Ministers have been accused of using more than £100,000 of public money to flood local newspapers and Facebook with “Tory propaganda”, with just weeks to go before the local elections. Facebook adverts paid for by the UK government in the past week are promoting levelling up spending in more than 30 areas, including many places where the Conservatives are hoping to make gains or defend council seats in May. It has also used taxpayer cash to pay for wrap-around adverts to cover the front page of local newspapers, boasting of “levelling up” across a map of the UK with the union flag. Places targeted include tight council areas such as Southend, Great Yarmouth, Derby, Wolverhampton and Walsall as well as general election marginals such as Darlington, Blyth Valley and Stoke-on-Trent. For example, in Southend, where the council is currently in no overall control with 23 Tories, 13 Labour and 14 other parties, the Facebook advert says: “Levelling up means: a £12m institute of tech to develop the skills of the future in Southend.” It is targeted at more than 1 million people and has had 400,000 to 450,000 page impressions, according to the Facebook ad library. There are also reports of radio adverts and even digital billboards in town centres. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities refused to say how much was being spent on the advertising campaign, saying it was ongoing and would be published in future, but the cost is likely to be far higher in total than the £100,000 spent on Facebook ads alone. Department for Levelling Up refusing to say how much they are spending on this paid advertising in local papers, billboards and online. What have they got to hide? pic.twitter.com/4PX384Njda The government has launched the spending campaign just before the official “purdah” period that prevents it from making public announcements or running campaigns, leading to accusations that it is using public money for political purposes. The ads have infuriated Labour MPs, but they have little power to do anything about it because of a lack of regulation around election advertising. However, some have considered whether to put in complaints to the National Audit Office about the use of public money. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, said: “There are serious questions to answer when ministers who can’t find any new funding for their flagship levelling up policy can suddenly find bags of public money for Conservative propaganda ahead of the local elections. “No wonder the much-trailed plans were met with such disappointment. This is now a government so lacking in ambition that it literally has to pay people to promote its flagship policies.” A Conservative source said the claims were “yet more nonsense from a Labour party that has no plan for Britain, and admitted they had run out of money last time they were in office”. A government spokesperson added: “These claims are untrue. Our levelling up campaign is running across the UK with areas chosen to portray real-life examples of levelling up already happening in towns and cities across the country, backed by more than £5bn in funding. “Our landmark levelling up white paper sets out a blueprint for how we will reverse this country’s geographical inequalities, spread opportunity and transform communities throughout the whole country.”",News/Politics,Ministers accused of using public funds for ‘Tory propaganda’ ads,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/ministers-accused-of-using-public-funds-for-tory-propaganda-ads
3/30/2022,"A 68-year-old man has been hanged for drug trafficking in Singapore in the first execution to be carried out in the city state in more than two years, as the UN rights office expressed concern over a “surge in execution notices”. Abdul Kahar bin Othman was convicted on two charges of trafficking diamorphine in 2013. He was sentenced to death in 2015. No executions are believed to have been carried out in Singapore since 2019, due to pending court applications that have forced the authorities to halt proceedings. However, the families of those facing the death sentence fear the authorities are now pushing ahead with hangings to free up space on death row. Kirsten Han, a journalist and activist who has spent a decade campaigning against the death penalty, said Abdul Kahar was executed on Wednesday morning. He had struggled with drug addiction since his teenage years, and had spent most of his life in prison, she said. His brothers told Han that their father, who had worked for the British military, died aged about 40, and that the family had struggled to manage financially. Han said: “The Singapore government regularly claims that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to drug trafficking. They talk about the harms that drugs can inflict upon people with addictions, and insist that the use of the capital punishment will help protect people and save lives. But there is no clear evidence that the death penalty is more effective than any other punishment in deterring drug offences.” Abdul Kahar’s story showed the situation was far more complicated than the “bad” drug trafficker and “victim” drug user narrative, she added. “He himself struggled with addiction to heroin. He needed sustained treatment, counselling and support to reintegrate into society. His family, too, needed help and guidance on how to best support him. Instead, all Abdul Kahar received was punishment, in the form of incarceration that only served to further alienate him from society and subject him to stigma. And now he’s gone.” In addition to Abdul Kahar, seven other death row prisoners have been given execution notice since 2019, according to the Transformative Justice Collective, a group that campaigns for reform of Singapore’s legal system. These include Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, a man with learning disabilities, who has spent a decade on death row for trafficking a small amount of heroin. His appeal was rejected by Singapore’s top court on Tuesday, despite an international outcry over his case. The UN Human Rights Office had called for Abdul Kahar’s execution to be halted, and for the authorities to commute his sentence to a term of imprisonment. “We are concerned at the surge in execution notices this year,” it said. The heads of mission of the European Union, EU member states and the diplomatic missions of Norway and Switzerland in Singapore made similar calls in a joint statement, and urged the authorities to adopt a moratorium on all executions “as a positive first step towards its abolition”. The statement said: “Today, more than two-thirds of the countries of the world have become abolitionist in law or practice, which confirms a global trend in favour of the abolition of the death penalty. No compelling evidence exists to show that the death penalty serves as a more efficient deterrent to crime than imprisonment.” It added: “Furthermore, any errors – inevitable in any legal system – are irreversible.” The Singapore government did not respond to a request for comment.",News/World news,Man hanged in Singapore amid concern over surge of execution notices,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/man-hanged-in-singapore-amid-concern-over-surge-of-execution-notices
3/30/2022,"Shane Warne – the starry-eyed boy from suburban Melbourne who became the king of spin – has been remembered as an irreplaceable cricket giant, an Aussie larrikin and a doting father, during a star-studded state memorial service at his beloved Melbourne Cricket Ground. Wednesday night’s service culminated with the re-naming of the MCG’s largest stand in his honour to immortalise his record-breaking career, causing the crowd of adoring fans to erupt into cheers of “Warnie”. The state funeral was attended by cricket legends, celebrities and political leaders, all paying tribute to one of the game’s most popular figures. The service featured video musical tributes and dedications by Warne’s celebrity friends Sir Elton John, Coldplay’s Chris Martin, Robbie Williams and Ed Sheeran. There were also live performances by singers Jon Stevens and Anthony Callea. The cricket great’s father, Keith Warne, commemorated his son as a doting father, a loving son and a caring brother, telling the crowd he was grateful the world loved Warne as much as he and his mother, Brigitte, did. Warne’s death was the family’s “darkest day”. Keith recounted a time Warne visited children in the Victorian town of Kinglake after the catastrophic 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, spending a day playing sports with families to lift their spirits. “This was Shane. Leading with infectious energy, his giving and that beaming smile. He somehow could always manage to make someone’s day that little bit better,” Keith Warne said. “He was a person who made everybody feel very special. He was always about putting smiles on other people’s faces. Kids loved him and he loved kids.” Summer Warne – the spin king’s youngest child – told the crowd about the last time she saw her father. Days before leaving for Thailand, Warne arrived at her house to pick up his bag with Bryan Adams’ hit Summer of ‘69 blaring from his car. “We both started dancing with not a care in the world … looking back at that memory now, it is so incredibly special,” she said. His son Jackson told the crowd he felt “robbed” at having his father taken from him, but reminisced of time spent enjoying the “simple things” – grocery shopping, watching movies or going for walks during Covid lockdowns. He said his father never pressured him to take up cricket and “just wanted him to be happy”. The event also featured memories from Warne’s former teammates and opponents. During a panel discussion, Warne’s first Test captain Allan Border said the spin bowler helped “revitalise” his captaincy. “I was lucky to have two years with Shane and just thank him for that,” he said. Former England captain Nasser Hussain, who travelled to Australia from the UK for the event, said he found “no delight” playing against Warne on the field. “He was the king bowler, the great bowler – but also the great sledger,” he said. The memorial was attended by the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the country’s opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, and was broadcast live across Australia, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and the UK – all places where Warne’s revival of the art of leg spin bowling inspired a legion of fans. Throughout the two-and-a-half-hour service, video tributes were played in the stadium from what MC Eddie McGuire described as a “galaxy of stars” who Warne called friends. Actor Hugh Jackman remembered Warne as someone who “sucked the marrow out of life”, while Danni Minogue described the cricketer as “Mr Sunshine”. McGuire also read a letter from James Packer who said he and his family had “lost their sunshine” too early. A video featured Chris Martin performing Coldplay’s hit Yellow from Central America. “You may hear a rooster in the distance, which I am thinking of as him because he and a rooster shared some qualities,” Martin joked. The MCG is where Warne claimed his 700th Test wicket in 2006 and took his hat track against England in the 1994 Ashes. It was where he was most celebrated. Warned died of a heart attack in Thailand on 4 March aged 52.

3/30/2022,"The nature of love as explored in the songs and duets of Brahms and Schumann was the subject of Jonas Kaufmann and Diana Damrau’s latest Barbican concert, carefully programmed by pianist Helmut Deutsch, and forming an effective sequel to their near-dramatised performances of Hugo Wolf’s Italienisches Liederbuch in 2018. Less overtly histrionic than that earlier concert, and consequently more reflective in tone, the new programme nevertheless had much in common with it, with groups of songs by each composer carefully fashioned into narratives of love, loss, desire and affirmation, all of them sharply differentiated. Unlike its predecessor, however – which gave us, after all, a self-contained work – this recital juxtaposed the little known with the familiar, and took occasional liberties with the latter. Both composers’ duets are genuine rarities and frequently fascinating. Schumann’s Tragödie, depicting a catastrophic elopement that leaves its lovers defenceless in exile, is marvellously structured with a song for each singer before the two voices weave together in sad contemplation of past and future. Brahms’s Boten der Liebe, which brought the concert to its close, is utterly ravishing with its interlocking vocal lines conveying infinite affection and quiet contentment. More equivocal, however, was Kaufmann and Damrau’s decision to fashion duets from songs containing dialogue but originally intended for a single performer, which brought home the bawdry, often overlooked, of Brahms’s Vergebliches Ständchen, but dissipated the tensions of his extraordinary Von ewiger Liebe. For the most part, they sang superbly. Kaufmann was on particularly fine form, his tone dark and beautiful, his dynamic control exemplary as he marvellously captured the introspection of Schumann’s unsettling Resignation and Brahms’s Waldeinsamkeit, and powered his way through the steady crescendo of Stille Tränen from Schumann’s Kerner Lieder with extraordinary intensity. Damrau took a few minutes to settle: there were a couple of moments, early on, when her diction slipped uncharacteristically. Later she gave us some wonderful things – shock as well as sadness in the second song of Tragödie, and a deeply felt, rapturous performance of Schumann’s Lied der Suleika. At over two hours, this was a longish programme, and Deutsch, tireless and indefatigable, played with great subtlety and dramatic restraint throughout.",Arts/Music,"Kaufmann/Damrau and Deutsch review – deeply felt, rapturous performance",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/30/kaufmanndamrau-and-deutsch-review-deeply-felt-rapturous-performance
3/30/2022,"Consumers have begun cutting back on food spending and reduced their use of gas and electricity at home, as more people report rising living costs and concern grows about the impact of soaring prices on the poorest households in Britain. According to an extensive survey of more than 13,000 adults in Great Britain, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said as many as 83% saw an increase in their cost of living this month, up from 62% in November. As utility bills and the weekly shop became more expensive, the ONS said 34% of those reporting rising living costs said they were using less gas and electricity at home, while 31% said they were spending less on food. Half have cut back on non-essentials. The ONS figures raise concerns that some of the poorest in Britain are being forced to make tough choices between heating and eating. They underline comments on Wednesday from the Bank of England’s deputy governor Ben Broadbent that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing the biggest-ever external hit to Britain’s economy. “From an economic perspective, coming on top of what was already a very steep rise in the cost of globally traded goods, in the wake of the pandemic, the invasion has led to substantial rises in the cost of energy and other commodities. “As a big net importer of manufacturers and commodities, it’s doubtful that the UK has ever experienced an external hit to real national income on this scale,” he said. Household gas and electricity bills are expected to rise by 54% from Friday, with charities warning of a sharp rise in poverty levels without further government support for the poorest families. Average band D council tax bills in England are also expected to go up by £67 on Friday to almost £2,000 a year. The UK’s annual inflation rate reached 6.2% in February – the highest in three decades – amid soaring energy costs, rising prices for food and drink and record petrol prices. With the planned increase in household energy prices from April, the Bank of England expects inflation to hit 8% this spring and has warned it could rise close to 10% later this year. Official forecasts show Britain is on track this year for the biggest annual hit to living standards since modern records began in 1956. Highlighting the risk to hard-pressed families, the ONS said as many as 29% of adults could not afford an unexpected but necessary expense of £850. Those on the lowest incomes, renters and those with no formal qualifications were the most likely to be unable to afford such an unexpected expense. Parents of dependent children, those who are divorced or separated, disabled adults and those living outside of London and the south of England were also less likely to manage. The government has announced a £9bn support package of council tax discounts and loans, although the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, faced criticism at his spring statement last week for prioritising tax cuts over increasing the value of universal credit benefits despite heavy pressure to do more to help low-income households. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the government urgently needed to provide more support. “With energy bills set to shoot up by £700 next month, and by hundreds more in the autumn, many households face being pushed into the red. “Ministers must do far more to help people get through this cost of living crisis. The support announced so far by the chancellor has been little more than thin gruel.”",News/Business,Soaring UK prices force some to choose between heating and eating,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/soaring-uk-prices-force-some-to-choose-between-heating-and-eating
