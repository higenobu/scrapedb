The admission comes as the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence tweeted that ""due to strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian territorial gains have been limited and achieved at significant cost to Russian forces."" ""We have serious losses but the Russians' losses are much, much bigger... They have colossal losses,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said, according to Reuters. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES A video posted online Friday by Ukraine’s military purportedly shows a Russian tank in flames along the side of the road. ""It feels good to burn. This is how Ukrainian soldiers continue to destroy Russian occupants along with armor equipment,"" it said. The U.K. says the battle over the Donbas region ""remains Russia’s main strategic focus, in order to achieve its stated aim of securing control over the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts."" Ukraine’s military, on its Facebook page, said Russian forces are firing artillery, mortars and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at its positions in the Donetsk and Tavriya regions to prevent the regrouping of troops. ""Russian occupiers continue to blockade Ukrainian units in Mariupol, near the Azovstal [steel] plant,"" it added. Ukraine’s military also said Friday that Russian forces ""continue to take measures to restrict the movement and detention of local residents and block humanitarian goods from the territory of Ukraine. ""In addition, Russian occupiers are robbing peasants,"" the military wrote on its Facebook page. ""For example, more than 60 tons of wheat were stolen from an agricultural society in the town of Kamianka-Dniprovska together with a truck.""",World/Fox News,"Ukraine admits 'serious losses' in eastern battles, but says Russia's are 'colossal'",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-admits-apos-serious-losses-132136423.html
4/30/2022,"People are leaving Twitter at alarming rates following the news that billionaire Elon Musk has now acquired the company. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the follower counts for high-profile accounts like former President Barack Obama (the most-followed Twitter user) and Katy Perry have seen a significant drop on the social media platform. “Obama, who is Twitter’s most-followed user with 131.7 million followers, saw his follower count fall by 300,000 since Monday, NBC News says. Perry, who has 108.8 million followers, lost 200,000,” the outlet reports. And, what’s more, the decrease is allegedly happening due to Elon Musk’s estimated $44 billion purchase. While the popular social media platform does a routine cleanse to get rid of bots and any fake accounts, experts have noticed that the recent drops in follower accounts have been organic rather than the normal deletion of bots. “While we continue to take action on accounts that violate our spam policy which can affect follower counts, these fluctuations appear to largely be a result of an increase in new account creation and deactivation,” Twitter told NBC News. On the reverse, the followers of significant right-wing figures have reportedly seen a spike since the Musk Twitter news. The number of people following GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has gone up by 100,000. Brazillian leader Jair Bolsonaro, known to fall on the far-right side of politics, has gained 90,000 new followers since Monday. Either way, Musk is on a mission to change the Twitter narrative. As AfroTech previously reported, during a conversation at TED2022, he spoke about having an “inclusive arena for free speech” if he were to become the owner of the app. “I think it’s very important that we have an inclusive arena for free speech,” he said. “Twitter has sort of become a de facto Times Square. It’s really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they’re able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.”",Business/AfroTech,Twitter's Most-Followed User Barack Obama Loses Hundreds Of Thousands Of Followers After Elon Musk News,https://news.yahoo.com/twitters-most-followed-user-barack-205135280.html
4/30/2022,"On a routine mission to take aerial photographs of the Red Planet, the Mars helicopter Ingenuity captured something unusual. In one of its photographs, scientists could see what looked like a landing capsule, a supersonic parachute, and other debris scattered across the Martian landscape. All the evidence pointed to the wreckage being from some sort of spacecraft, and as it turns out, the evidence was right. ""Technically, this *is* the wreckage of a flying saucer that crashed on Mars that belongs to aliens,"" Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, tweeted.

The wreckage was found to be from another Martian spacecraft; it is a part that detached during the landing of the Perseverance rover back in February 2021. The photos of the wreckage, while fascinating on their own merit, will actually help scientists plan more landings on the surface of Mars in the future. According to NASA, Martian landings are ""fast-paced and stressful"". A vehicle entering Mars' atmosphere can spiral into the planet at nearly 12,500 mph and wrestle with high temperatures and intense gravitational forces. Being able to study the wreckage that remains might allow scientists to make changes that allow for smoother landings in the future. ""Every time we're airborne, Ingenuity covers new ground and offers a perspective no previous planetary mission could achieve,"" Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity's team lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said. Perseverance was launched on July 30, 2020, traveling more than 290 million miles, with tiny 4-pound Ingenuity riding along as an unexpected companion. Ingenuity and Perseverance both landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, exactly 203 days later. Concept art of NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter flying on the Red Planet while the Perseverance rover also works nearby. (NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) Ingenuity, which went from an improbable idea to Perseverance's spaceflight buddy, has proved that a helicopter-style rover can work. When Ingenuity made its first flight on April 19, 2021, it became the first human-made craft to ever fly on another planet. There were concerns that Ingenuity wouldn't be able to make it off the ground. Mars' atmospheric volume is much thinner than Earth's, coming in at an atmospheric volume of less than 1% of our planet's, according to the European Space Agency, making it unclear if a helicopter could take off. But take off Ingenuity did, and multiple times too. The photos were taken on Ingenuity's 26th flight on the Red Planet. During that flight, the helicopter traveled for 159-seconds and covered 1,181 feet of distance, according to NASA. All told, the marvel of modern engineering has traveled over 3.9 miles in nearly 40 minutes aloft, with plenty of flights still to go. For the latest weather news, check back on AccuWeather.com.

4/30/2022,"A leading Kremlin mouthpiece has warned that the West’s overt backing for Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory could lead not to Russia’s defeat but to the “total annihilation” of Ukraine. The warning from Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, came after further Ukrainian strikes overnight on the border city of Belgorod, a key supply center for Russian military forces in eastern Ukraine. “Explosions and air defense sirens in Belgorod,” Simonyan wrote early Thursday in a message on Telegram. “The Anglo-Saxons publicly encourage Ukraine to take their hostilities into Russian territory. And they give them means to carry that plan out. “What choice do you leave us, idiots? The total annihilation of what remains of Ukraine? A nuclear strike?” In Putinist circles the term “Anglo-Saxons” can be used as a bit of a catch-all for malign Western influences, but there appeared to be little doubt that Simonyan’s message was referring to Britain. British defence minister James Heappey prompted outrage in Moscow earlier this week when he said he thought it was “completely legitimate” for Ukrainian forces to strike against targets in Russia and it was “not necessarily a problem’” if they used weapons donated by Britain. The British military has actively trained Ukrainian forces since Russia annexed Crimea and sent special forces into eastern Ukraine in 2014. The U.K. has also supplied large amounts of arms, including valuable mobile anti-tank weapons. In an interview with Times Radio, Heappey said: “Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country. “That started a war between Ukraine and Russia, and in war Ukraine needs to strike into its opponent’s depth to attack its logistics lines, its fuel supplies, its ammunition depots, and that’s part of it.” Putin himself got in on the threat in a speech to lawmakers in St Petersburg on Wednesday. “If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside, and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast,” he said. “We have all the tools for this, things no one else can boast of having now. And we will not boast, we will use them if necessary. And I want everyone to know that.” It is not the first time that Kremlin leaders or propagandists have warned of a nuclear conflagration, although the threats have become ever clearer and less veiled as the war drags on. When he ordered the invasion on Feb. 24, Putin warned that those who tried to stop Russia achieving its aims would face “consequences that you’ve never faced in your history”—which was taken to mean nuclear weapons. At that point, the invasion still appeared to be an almost comfortable imperialist adventure for Putin and his generals, who were super-confident that Ukrainian resistance would soon be snuffed out and the government of Volodymyr Zelensky ousted. But, out-thought and outfought by better-prepared Ukrainian forces, the Russians suffered a humiliating setback in the battle for Kyiv. Forced to retreat, the Russian military is now focusing its might on areas of eastern and southern Ukraine, where it is making costly but grinding progress as it tries to encircle Ukrainian forces in the east and take full control of the Black Sea coast up to Odesa. The Ukrainian defence ministry said on Thursday that the Russians, who are now fighting under a single commander, were stepping up their offensives in both eastern Ukraine and in the south and “exerting intense fire” on all fronts. In the early battle for Kyiv, Russia suffered painful losses at the hands of Ukrainian light infantry and special forces, who used their knowledge of the terrain to take out Russian columns—leaving behind the oxidised remains of Russian tanks and fighting vehicles, identifiable only by the letter “Z”. Military experts say the latest phase of the war—just as crucial for Ukraine's survival as a nation—is more conventional in terms of warfare, fought on flatter and more open terrain with the power of each side's artillery key to success. A number of Western nations are sending hundreds of artillery pieces, plus tens of thousands of shells, to Ukraine. The Pentagon on Wednesday published pictures of dozens of 155-mm howitzers being loaded onto an aircraft at the March Air Reserve Base in California. The ever-increasing flow of weaponry into Ukraine presents a huge issue for the Russians, whose own munition factories are largely sitting idle for a lack of foreign-made components because of international sanctions. Hence the growing chorus of nuclear threats from the Kremlin and its mouthpieces. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.
