2/13/2022,"Ihave spent much of the past decade talking to people about love. I make it clear that any type of love is a welcome topic but when I ask what love is, my interviewees often shoot straight to romantic love. This is partly down to the inadequacy of our language: that small word has to do a lot of heavy lifting. But it is also because of the multibillion-pound industry that has convinced us the search for “the one” is the be-all and end-all. Mention love and that’s where we immediately go. But does this obsession with romantic love still reflect the lives we lead? In my new book, Why We Love: The New Science Behind our Closest Relationships, I have spoken to people from different backgrounds who have made me rethink our acceptance of romantic love as the dominant narrative. For some it is not a priority, for others it is a restrictive stereotype, while for others it can be a source of risk. As Valentine’s Day comes round again maybe it’s time for a different perspective.  Human love is a special thing, unique in its longevity and the sheer number of beings we are capable of loving. We can love our family, our friends, our lovers. We can also love across the species boundary and the spiritual divide. And as AI romps ahead it may be that one day we can find love with an avatar or robot. In part, writing my book was driven by a desire, born of a decade of research, to get us to re-engage with and celebrate the different types of love in our lives. All forms of love carry the same joys and benefits as romantic love. In some cases, such as with our best friends, the love we have for them can be more emotionally intimate and less stress inducing than any we have with a lover. Demographic data shows that the downgrading of romantic love is, to some extent, already happening. Figures from the Office for National Statistics and Relate show that by 2039, one in seven people in the UK will be living alone and today only one in six people believe in “the one”. This change is particularly striking for women. Go back 100 years and your survival was predicated on finding a man who would support you and your inevitable brood of children. But with emancipation and the arrival of contraception women can choose not to partner themselves to anyone else and can remain happily child-free. Instead, they can build loving relationships with other people and beings who are capable of fulfilling all their needs. Relationships, science shows us, are underpinned by the same biological and psychological mechanisms and are as beneficial to health and wellbeing as romantic love. Any hierarchy of importance is a cultural construct. Even when we consider romantic love there is a spectrum of opportunity beyond monogamy which we rarely acknowledge. At one end are the aromantics who do not experience romantic love. It shows how far we have swallowed the romantic love narrative that they are characterised as being cold and unloving. But my aromantic interviewees do not lack love. They have full and loving lives, with family, friends, even queer platonic partners with whom they may have children. Their main issue is navigating a world where every person, every media outlet appears to be obsessed with romantic love. At the other end of the spectrum are the polyamorists. A group who experience romantic and sexual love with more than one partner. Again, the all-pervasive narrative of romantic love has led us to depict those who practise polyamory in a less than favourable light. They are characterised as being promiscuous, immoral, untrustworthy and dissatisfied. But to be successful, polyamorous relationships have to be based on trust, truth and open communication. They are moral because love for another is openly acknowledged rather than hidden in the secret of an affair. And while people can stay in monogamous relationships because of the legal ties that bind them, polyamorists recommit to their relationships every day. The power of the romantic narrative to drive dating behaviour and commerce is clear but it may also have darker consequences. In 2017 the testimony of 15 women regarding intimate partner violence (IPV) was published. It was clear that one of the issues with IPV was the stories these women had heard about what love was. Love overcomes all obstacles and must be maintained at all costs (even when you’re being abused). Love is about losing control, being swept off your feet, having no say in who you fall for (even if they are violent). Lovers protect each other, fight for each other to the end (even against the authorities who are trying to protect you). It is interesting to contemplate the power of our words. We speak without thinking but the stories we tell our children have consequences. Perhaps when ones survival, social standing and acceptance is predicated on coupling up, the obsession with romantic love is understandable. And it will always have a place in the spectrum of love. But we can experience love in so many different ways that we underestimate, even neglect. We are missing out on so much. Maybe it’s time to admit that for a significant number of people romantic love is no longer the ultimate goal, that Valentine’s Day is a commercial invention that has run its course and that we need to embrace all the opportunities for love in our lives to fully experience what it is to be human. It’s time for an inclusive celebration of love rather than an exclusive one. Time for a rebrand.

2/13/2022,"Popping up in living rooms across the country, and certainly as questions in my inbox, is the new generation of grow lights. An amazing tool, these can be a conundrum for many. So here’s a quick guide to cut through the confusion. First things first. The concept of grow lamps isn’t exactly new. As a way to boost plant growth in areas with poor natural light they have been kicking around since at least the early 1980s. The problem is that, until very recently, they were enormous, incredibly complex to fit, and kicked out so much heat that, ironically, they could often burn the very foliage they were trying to nurture. That’s before we considered their eye-watering cost, not only to buy but to run. We were talking upwards of £200 to buy a single, incredibly energy-inefficient bulb.  All this started to change, however, about 10 years ago when a new generation of LED lights started hitting the market. Using a fraction of the energy and emitting very little heat, these products have been steadily decreasing in both size and price over the years. You can now buy bulbs that will fit any standard desk lamp for little more than the price of regular ones. Even flexible LED strips can be taped into place to line the underside of bookshelves, cabinets and larger terrariums. As pretty much all houseplants need to be grown within 2m of a window, these lamps dramatically open up new opportunities for indoor growers – and even for regular gardeners who grow many tender or half-hardy species from seed each year, such as tomatoes. Without a greenhouse, grow lamps are really the only way to get significant quantities of seedlings away at this time of year. This sudden boom has meant there are now so many options available in different shapes, forms and colours, it can be a little bewildering. As a basic rule, the most important thing to remember is that plants will grow in really any light that humans can see. However, they do have preferred spectra, which mainly look blue or red to our eyes. That’s why many grow lamps have crazy disco hues to them, with many even having adjustable functions to change their colour. This is because changing the wavelengths of light that plants experience can, amazingly, change their behaviour. For example, upping certain wavelengths of UV can make cannabis kick out more resins, or infrared can cause commercial tomato crops to fruit more. However, are these really relevant to home growers who just want plants to look good? No. Can you even see a plant’s true colours under coloured lights? Nope. Do they fit in with most people’s idea of what they want their living room to look like? Probably not. So, I would always side-step these in favour of the simplest options that emit white light. Frankly, even regular daylight bulbs will work fine. So please don’t feel confused, just pick the options that fit your budget and witness how your indoor growing opportunities will suddenly be widened.

2/13/2022,"The Ashes aftershocks have rumbled on over the past week, and on Tuesday peaked with the news that neither Jimmy Anderson nor Stuart Broad will feature when the so-called “red-ball reset” begins in the Caribbean next month. Both are known to be hurt to miss out and a touch miffed at being told in a couple of short, sharp phone calls rather than in person. Broad was literally raging against the machine in his final outing – picking a fight with a robot camera that kept moving on the boundary’s edge in Hobart.  In the boardroom at the England and Wales Cricket Board, with pictures of the record-breaking pair on the wall, Andrew Strauss tried to explain the rationale. He insisted Anderson and Broad would still be “in the mix” come the summer and this was a case of separating out England’s strategy home and away. It was also not, he claimed, a case of either being a negative dressing-room presence. “They are exceptional performers on the field and very professional off it, which is why they have played for so long,” said Strauss. “It gives an opportunity at the moment for people to stand up and play leadership roles they haven’t previously.” On the flip side, hasn’t an environment that has appeared soft for some time now suddenly become even softer? Anderson and Broad may be grouchy old pros at 39 and 35 respectively but they also set a fiercely high standard; more fool the teammate who hasn’t mined their combined 321 caps of nous or been driven to emulate their ongoing commitment to physical conditioning. Certainly Matthew Fisher, plucked from Yorkshire on promise and one of two uncapped seamers alongside Saqib Mahmood, is disappointed he will not work alongside them. Chris Woakes, surprisingly reprieved, is now the senior bowler on tour with 42 caps, with Mark Wood (25), Ollie Robinson (nine) and Craig Overton (six) combining for fewer. Strauss spoke of a “new cycle” starting – a phrase that grinds the gears of many who feel England have too often been guilty of not focusing on the Test in front of them – but as an interim director of cricket without designs on a return full time, it is debatable whether he had the mandate to make such a significant policy shift. Logically, the main aim of the caretaker management team on the five-week tour should be to steady the listing ship. Fresh blood was clearly required in the batting department but shoring up the captaincy of Joe Root results-wise should be the priority before the new director of cricket, selector and head coach outline their vision. To that end, and with Jofra Archer and Olly Stone still injured, one or both of Anderson and Broad would surely have helped Root here, even if the Sydney Test – when the pair became slightly leggy in the second innings and Wood’s workload went up – suggested their days in the same XI should be limited. The input from the Test captain, who was in the selection meeting but without a vote, is a bit vague too. After all, at the end of the Ashes walloping, Root was asked whether he wanted Anderson and Broad to plough on and replied: “Why wouldn’t you want class like that?” Strauss stressed the 16-man squad selected has not been imposed and so Root’s view has clearly changed; certainly his take on No 3 has, the impending move to a spot where he averages 38, after his annus mirabilis of six centuries at No 4, representing a second policy shift that feels counterintuitive. That move is one that can be more easily reversed, at least, and Root will no doubt look to shift the focus away from the headline omissions and back on to those selected for a tour that is historically tough and three years ago witnessed a vastly more experienced England side turned over. Alex Lees will be the latest opener hoping to jam the revolving door after his own reboot at Durham, while the silken talents of Ben Foakes behind the stumps will make a return to international stage. Matt Parkinson, a similar cause celebre among England supporters, is the second spin option alongside Jack Leach, even if Root’s management of this department remains maddening. In another era Root would be back in the ranks by now but then in another era the wider response to Anderson and Broad would be different too. Certainly the past week in English cricket has not matched the frenzy witnessed around Justin Langer’s exit as Australia head coach, which in itself feels slightly instructive. Coaches come and go. So, too, underperforming players, such as the six other Englishmen to walk the plank. But a pair of all-time greats, whose recent performances still place them in the top bracket of fit and available seamers? Supporters have made their feelings known – the majority seem shocked and fearful it’s all over – but it has not hit the levels of the Langer debate. Perhaps this is in part down to Strauss leaving the door ajar (even if departing players, bar Kevin Pietersen, seldom see it double-bolted publicly anyway). The high regard in which Strauss is held – something built on the 308 wickets Anderson and Broad shared under his captaincy – may have played a role too. But even factoring in these elements, the alarm bells that scarcely stop ringing at the ECB these days should have grown a bit louder by the fact that the country at large was not mouthing “WTF?”; that radio phone-ins were not beset with an avalanche of calls either berating or backing the decision. This does not feel like a population left apathetic by a succession of lamentable mornings, where grim scorecards lay in wait like bloodied horses heads under the covers. It’s rather a national team that has lost centrality in the zeitgeist and two utterly stellar careers that have played out almost entirely behind a paywall. During the Ashes summer in Australia it was hard not to be jealous; jealous that the exploits of their men’s and women’s teams are part of the national conversation through free-to-air coverage and jealous that their Test grounds are flooded with little champions playing cricket on the concourses, not solely the domain of grownups. Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, is reportedly working to renew the broadcasting contract before his expected departure. He won’t, because money talks, but if there is to be a true “red-ball reset” then the next deal should see at least one Test match per summer available on every television set in the country.",Sport/Sport,Lack of fury over fate of Broad and Anderson should have ECB worried | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/13/lack-of-fury-over-fate-of-broad-and-anderson-should-have-ecb-worried
2/13/2022,"It’s easy to miss good news amid coverage of the pandemic, the rising cost of living and the, ahem, rest. However, the United Kingdom is getting something right. On Thursday, the government announced that it is investing up to £23m to boost artificial intelligence (AI) skills by creating up to 2,000 scholarships across England. This will fund masters conversion courses for people from non-Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) degrees.  “This will attract a less homogeneous group,” explains Tabitha Goldstaub, who chairs the government’s AI council and advises the Alan Turing Institute, “which means the UK AI ecosystem benefits from graduates with different backgrounds, perspectives and life experiences”. This investment in widening education and opportunity is just one of several steps in the 10-year AI national strategy, which aims to make Britain a world leader in AI. We’re not the only ones; as the AI dashboard at the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) shows, many other countries have their eye on the same prize. The frontrunners in this race, the United States and China, have bigger populations and deeper pockets, while the European Union has an impressive record in setting global norms and rules for data protection. To have any hope of keeping up, at the very least the UK must find a way to punch above its weight. The signs are promising. AI is already an unstoppable force in our economy. According to Tech Nation, there are more than 1,300 AI companies in the United Kingdom. Research commissioned by the government and published last month shows UK businesses spent around £63bn on AI technology and AI-related labour in 2020 alone. This figure is expected to reach more than £200bn by 2040, when it is predicted more than 1.3m UK businesses will be using AI. Even so, to make the most of the opportunities that this offers – and to understand the risks – we will need to upgrade how we educate and train our workforce. This will be tricky because AI is surrounded by a lot of hype and mixed messages. Depending on who’s talking, AI will be a “more profound change than fire or electricity” (Google CEO, Sundar Pichai), it could “spell the end of the human race” (Professor Stephen Hawking) or help us “save the environment, cure disease and explore the universe” (Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind). Some AI researchers strike a more cautious tone, arguing that AI is just “statistics on steroids” (Dr Meredith Broussard) and “neither artificial nor intelligent” (Dr Kate Crawford). All agree that AI is transforming how we work, live, wage war and even understand what it means to be human, as Professor Stuart Russell explored in his BBC Reith Lectures in December. As we aim for the goal of becoming a world leader in AI, the United Kingdom must choose between putting ethics at the core of our strategy or leaving it as an option – a bolt-on at best. This is not a choice between being unethical or ethical; rather, it reflects a fear that regulation risks stifling innovation, especially if other countries do not prioritise ethics in their approach to AI. However, ethics is about more than laws and regulations, compliance and checklists. It’s about designing the world we want to live in. As Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who created the world wide web, explained in 2018: “As we’re designing the system, we’re designing society… Nothing is self-evident. Everything has to be put out there as something that we think will be a good idea as a component of our society.” Again, he was ahead of his time. A new role is emerging in our economy: technology ethicist. Its contours are still being shaped. Is it a technologist who works in ethics? An ethicist who works in technology? Can anyone call themselves a technology ethicist or is it an anointed position? Rather than focus on what technology ethicists are, let’s consider what they do. They might have trained in the law, data science, design or philosophy or as artists and designers. They might be employed by universities (and not just in the philosophy and computer science departments) or work in thinktanks, NGOs, private companies or any part of government. They may infuse new meaning into existing roles, such as researcher, software developer and project manager. Or they might have new responsibilities, such as responsible AI lead, algorithmic reporter or AI ethicist. They are working daily to ensure that government websites are accessible to all UK inhabitants or fighting to force the government to reveal the algorithm it is using to identify disabled people as potential benefit fraudsters, subjecting them to stressful checks and months of frustrating bureaucracy. They are doing open-source intelligence investigations into crime, terrorism and human rights abuses, or improving healthcare delivery, or protecting children online. They are working in virtual reality and augmented reality and building – and warning about – the metaverse. Some of the leading technology ethicists in the world were either educated and trained in the UK or are living and working here now. This presents us with a unique opportunity to draw on their talents to ensure that ethics is embedded into our AI strategy, rather than treated as an elective or a bolt-on. This is about more than redesigning our education curriculum or new ways of working. It’s about creating the future.  Stephanie Hare is a researcher and broadcaster.

2/13/2022,"By the summer of 2020, veterinary practices were beginning to feel the effects of the pandemic pet boom. That was the time that Melanie, a small-animal vet from the southeast of England, realised she no longer wanted to be in the profession. The feeling left her at a loss. All she’d ever done was eat, breathe and sleep veterinary medicine. Like many vets she had been inspired since she was a child: religiously watching TV shows such as Animal Hospital and Vets in Practice, mucking out stables to embellish her university application and completing a five-year degree before finding work at a busy practice. It was a vocation, not a job: she simply loved animals. “Ever since I knew what a vet was, I wanted to be one,” she says. “I don’t remember a time when I didn’t want to do that – until now.” But for Melanie, the pressure of lockdown was just the start. During the initial mayhem, practices were forced to work within strict Covid restrictions. Many team members were off sick, isolating or furloughed. Melanie worked three shifts on, three shifts off with a skeleton staff, clocking two hours’ overtime every evening out of a sense of duty. The busiest day in the practice calendar was usually Boxing Day. But between March and July 2020, says Melanie, every day felt as if it was Boxing Day “if the toilet was flooded and the lab was on fire”. Staff bounced from the reception to operations, from remote appointments to emergencies, shepherding animals in for treatment from the street while brushing off abuse from stressed-out owners who were unhappy about wearing masks, didn’t want to wait outside or refused to accept that they couldn’t receive a home visit to have their cat’s claws clipped.  Then the infamous surge in new pets struck. The practice was swamped with lockdown puppies and kittens needing check-ups, vaccinations and neutering. The intensity of the work continued. To Melanie, it all became a bit of a blur – but one moment that changed everything was when she heard that the partner of a friend, both of whom were vets, had taken her own life. Covid restrictions meant she was unable to offer support in person. It was crushing. The profession she loved seemed to be in disarray. As the pandemic wore on, Melanie’s exhausted colleagues began to bow out. By late 2021, her practice – which usually has about 15 vets – had lost half of them and only managed to replace a handful. One of those to depart for an alternative line of work had been a vet for eight years. “At the end of the first lockdown there was a sense of camaraderie,” says Melanie. “Now everyone’s just broken.” The pandemic has been good for pets. For vets, less so. Puppies and kittens have made things bearable for many of us, yet for those who keep our companion animals in good health, the meteoric increase in pet ownership has been overwhelming. A total of 3.2m households in the UK have acquired a pet since the start of Covid, according to a report by the Pet Food Manufacturers’ Association. The majority of dog and cat owners believed their pet had an “extremely” positive effect on their wellbeing during the pandemic, according to a large-scale survey by researchers at the University of the West of Scotland. Meanwhile, Vetlife, a charity that provides emotional, financial and mental-health support to the veterinary community, received 4,000 calls to its helpline in 2020 – its busiest year on record. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) conducted a survey of veterinary professionals in July and August 2021 and found that 80% saw an increase in their caseload due to a rise in animal ownership. Many felt this took a toll on them, with 65% experiencing conflict between their wellbeing and their professional roles. It’s part of a perfect storm in which staff shortages due to the pandemic and Brexit have collided with record demand. There’s even a cat vaccine shortage at the moment. It’s just another thing on a long list of problems for a weary vet. The reality of modern veterinary care is very different to how the public imagines it. That’s one reason why Gareth Steel, a Scottish vet, started jotting down his thoughts. He hopes that the resulting book, Never Work with Animals, which is published this month, will “help close the gap between perception and reality”. The book documents the grit and emotion of the job: working 100-hour weeks for minimum wage, tackling health problems as varied as the animals – and owners – themselves. For Steel, hit TV shows like All Creatures Great and Small, based on a series of books by James Herriot, have nurtured a romanticised notion of the life of a vet. “That was written in the 1960s, about the 1930s,” he says. “The vet will go to see a cow, then maybe drive back and see the neighbour’s dog… and that’ll be one episode. Compare that to now, where the average UK vet sees a new animal with a new problem every 10 minutes. And with the staff shortages that’s often your problem to solve as an individual with little help or guidance.” Amid the recent pet boom, the stakes for delivering good veterinary care have never been higher. Pets have transcended their animal status to become royal members of the household they reside in: fur babies, proxy children, influencers. People – quite reasonably – expect a level of care to match. But while the British public is used to free healthcare, there’s no NHS for pets. “People really don’t understand what animal healthcare costs,” says Steel. “Through no fault of their own, people have slightly naive perspectives on how veterinary care is delivered and what it costs, the skills involved and how available that might be to them,” he says. “Probably 90% of the stress of my job has to do with this. Having to say to a client, here’s [financial] option one, or two, or three, rather than just being able to concentrate on the medicine.” It doesn’t help that many of these new pets are uninsured. Despite the pet boom, insurance subscriptions have only increased by 1%, according to the Association of British Insurers, while a Mintel report suggests that around half of pets bought since March 2020 remain without cover. It means many people only realise the true cost of pet ownership when their animal becomes sick or injured. In an interview with Radio 5 Live last August, James Russell, president of the British Veterinary Association (BVA), said the sector was “exhausted”. He stopped short of requesting that the public stop getting pets (just), instead asking people to “think long and hard before they take on a new pet to make sure they can meet all its needs, including access to veterinary care”. Insurance or no, some practices have had to close their books to new clients, which was once unheard of, yet still new pets keep joining the queue. Bianca Bassanello, 35, a vet from South Wales, works in a 24/7 emergency clinic. She is regularly faced with challenging and emotional negotiations with owners who lack cover. The lucrative business of designer dogs has led to particular problems, she tells me, such as unlicensed dealers showing up with an animal in need of an emergency caesarean or puppies bought from Gumtree by people who can’t afford to care for them. “People are spending thousands of pounds on a French bulldog and then it ends up being put down because they don’t have any money left to treat it,” she says. “It’s like people paying for a Ferrari, but they can’t afford the tyres.” In some cases vets ask the owner to sign the animal over to them so they can pay for the treatment themselves. “We’re strongly advised not to do it,” says Bassanello, “but sometimes it gets to that point of emotional fatigue with the situation. You don’t know what to do with the animal, but you think, ‘I would rather own that dog and pay £1,500 to get it fixed and give it to a charity to rehome than let it die.’” She adds: “Sometimes people refuse to give up their pet – they’d rather the animal was put to sleep. How are you supposed to move on from that?” The high emotional stakes, the staff shortages, the cost of treatment, the stress of the pandemic… it’s all leading to an increase of abuse towards veterinary staff. Almost six in 10 vets experienced some form of intimidation on the job in 2020, according to the BVA, an increase of 10% on the previous year. Vet nurses and receptionists often bear the brunt of it. One vet told me she had seen more abuse in the past 18 months than in all her seven years of working, adding that she has had to deregister three clients from her practice because of their behaviour in the past six months alone. Bassanello tells me she never needed to call the police to work before the pandemic. “I’ve received direct threats myself, been called the C-word at 1am and I know of cases where the police have had to become involved due to harassment on social media,” she says. “There have been clients where we are advised to call the police should they show up to the clinic, but we’re still professionally obliged to treat their animal.” For Melanie, dealing with abuse during an already challenging time was “absolutely disheartening”, and she is far from alone in feeling disillusioned. One vet, who qualified in 2014, told me she stepped back from the front line after spending most of the pandemic working 50-hour weeks in a practice that was “chronically understaffed”. Others described the dismay at falling out of love with a job they’d always wanted to do. “I worked my backside off to become a vet,” said one. “Now I don’t know why.” Many vets are throwing in the towel shortly after qualifying. There has already been a significant drop in new joiners and nearly half of those to quit have been working for less than five years, according to RCVS, which held an urgent summit on recruitment and retention in late 2021. With morale low, the mental health of many vets is suffering. One vet told me that “around half” of her colleagues are on some sort of medication for anxiety or depression. “There are probably more colleagues than I’m aware of that are struggling emotionally, physically, mentally,” she said. “It’s just neverending. You see 20 animals a day and we get so anxious about getting something wrong – that one mistake will be the one that ends up with the owner attacking you on social media.” Danny Chambers, a vet and mental-health campaigner, runs the Veterinary Voices Facebook group, which has more than 15,000 members. “I’d sum it up in two words,” he says. “Exhaustion and burnout.” Rosie Allister is a vet surgeon who manages the Vetlife helpline and researches mental health and wellbeing in the veterinary community. Since the pandemic, the helpline, which operates as a 24/7 support service, has encountered a 25% increase in calls. One in 20 calls are from a vet experiencing suicidal thoughts and another one in 20 describes self-harm. “There’s a lot of stuff around working conditions and stress,” she says. “I don’t think people realised there would be sustained pressure for so long.” The pandemic has added to the strain, but poor mental health is a long-term issue within the veterinary community. Vets have a suicide rate four times higher than the national average and twice as high as other healthcare professionals, according to Oxford’s Centre for Suicide Research. The reasons for this are complicated and it is not, as is sometimes assumed, due to the stress or sorrow of having to routinely put animals to sleep. As Allister emphasises, suicide is always multifactoral, but some studies have suggested that the attitude vets have towards euthanasia could be a contributory factor, as could access to drugs or firearms. Many vets have a tendency to hold themselves to very high standards and can often work long hours alone. Ultimately, it’s a challenging, unpredictable job, with high stakes resting on one’s ability to do it properly, so occupational stress is high. At times, this sense of duty can override the welfare of the individual. “It’s difficult when you feel as if you’re constantly pushing yourself because there comes a point when that becomes the norm,” says Allister. “And that’s really hard for people. It’s challenging at the moment for those who need to decompress and have more of a balance again. But how do you achieve that when there’s still this huge demand and you can’t recruit enough staff to help you?” For vets like Melanie, it was difficult to see how to make the job work without making a dramatic change. Midway through 2020, she switched to working purely nights. It seems counterintuitive but it was the only thing that kept her in the job for the following year. “The beauty of night work is that people only call you if they really need you,” she says. “I could step away from dealing with the relentless calls and the constant barrage of abuse and just focus on the animals.” Towards the end of last year, she gave birth to her first child. She’s not sure if she’ll return to the profession. “I’m waking up every three hours throughout the night to feed my baby, but it feels like a break,” she says. “I don’t have to wake up and worry about what’s going to happen tomorrow.” Vetlife provides a 24/7 phone and email helpline.

2/13/2022,"It was a Saturday morning and Garry Ratcliffe, chief executive of a multi-academy trust of primary schools in Kent, was in school early to supervise the start of tutoring sessions provided by the government’s national tutoring programme (NTP). The programme aims to help pupils most in need of catching up after the disruption of Covid, and 12 children had been promised tuition. Ratcliffe’s school is in a deprived area with no culture of Saturday morning clubs, and parents had to be persuaded that it was worth sending in their children at the weekend.  But just 10 minutes before the sessions were due to start, the tutoring company rang to say they couldn’t find any tutors. Like many headteachers, Ratcliffe does not need convincing that one-to-one or small group tutoring can be a great way to help children. Middle-class parents pay for private tutors in their droves: 41% of 11- to 16-year-olds in London receive tuition outside school, according to research by the Sutton Trust, a charity that works on social mobility . The government’s £1.5bn programme is intended to level the playing field, bringing tutoring to pupils all over the country whose families could never afford it. “We really believed in it as an idea,” Ratcliffe said. “We contacted a tutoring company that was a registered partner. They promised the earth and delivered very little.” Ratcliffe’s trust arranged for pupils “in real need” of help with lost learning to come in for three-hour sessions over six weeks. On three of those Saturdays, the company called moments before the sessions to say it couldn’t find tutors. He said the tutors who did turn up were “a real mixed bag” in terms of quality. “One tutor was an absolute gem, another was on her mobile the whole time, and a third turned up asking us to print things out and whether we had anything on the four times table.” He added: “We gave strong feedback, which obviously the company was disappointed by as it would mean they might be dropped. They weren’t.” Sources said the government is poised to axe Randstad, the Dutch multinational company appointed to deliver the programme, after revelations that pupil enrolment is more than 90% below target. The latest official figures reveal that, as of 12 December, pupils had begun 52,000 courses with the official tuition partners through the main pillar of the programme. That is just 10% of the firm’s 524,000 target for this academic year. School leaders report serious problems with the service, including lack of availability and poor quality of tutors. Many say they have found the main NTP website too difficult to use. Many are turning their backs on the main route and organising tuition through a schools-led route instead. Randstad was awarded the contract to run the programme last June, after submitting a £25m bid that significantly undercut a bid from charities including the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which ran the programme in its first year. Randstad’s bid came in well below the £62m maximum proposed by the government. Sam Freedman, senior adviser to the education charity Ark and special adviser to Michael Gove when he was the secretary of state for education, said the procurement process was developed in a way that allowed price to become too important. Although Randstad was considerably cheaper, Freedman said its bid was “only just over the threshold” on quality. “Why was that allowed? It’s not a scientific judgment: someone must have decided to let them in.” Experts say that finding enough high-quality tutors, especially in more deprived areas where there is no established market for private tuition, was always going to be a challenge for a programme of this scale. However, Freedman said: “A proper provider would have been running a high-quality recruitment and training programme to get numbers up. They just don’t have the money to do that as the bid they put in was so low.” Michaela Ellis (not her real name) is a single mother from Redruth in Cornwall whose daughter fell behind in the pandemic with her GCSEs looming. She said she had been very pleased when the government first announced the programme because, as an unpaid carer, she would never have been able to afford tuition for her daughter herself. “I felt that some individual attention, even in a small group, would boost her confidence and she would feel less overwhelmed. But we are now weeks away from exams and she’s had nothing,” she says. A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) said: “We are determined to support children from all backgrounds to catch up on lost learning and reach their potential. Over 300,000 courses were delivered in the last term alone and the programme remains on track to deliver the ambitious target of teaching two million courses this academic year.” The spokesperson added that a range of measures would ensure all tutoring was of high quality. However, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) recently asked their members for feedback on the programme. The responses, which the Observer has seen, paint a very different picture. One secondary school head said: “I have one word for our experience of the programme: disastrous. No-shows, lack of subject specialist knowledge, punctuality issues. One of the tutors withdrew her services entirely on the day the students were expecting her.” The head of a secondary school in the south-west said they hadn’t been able to find any tutors through the main NTP programme. “We have had appointments booked [with NTP tutoring partners] to discuss, which have been cancelled at the last minute. We have heard from other schools that you don’t often get the same tutor each time which is difficult for the students. We have tried local tutors and have had no response.” The school has decided to use the direct schools funding pathway to pay its own staff to deliver extra tuition after school. The head said: “Our staff are exhausted but want to make sure our students get a good deal.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the ASCL, said: “If you are in an area like the north-east or south-west, where tutoring isn’t part of the cultural tradition, and you’re not allowed to employ your own people, supply is always going to get in the way.” Barton says the programme is currently operating with “byzantine complexity”. His union is calling for all the money to be given directly to schools instead. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the 20 pages of advisory notes and a website that is “far from intuitive” on how to register interest or find a tutor are putting schools off using the NTP. “One of the biggest problems is that they have taken something that should have been simple for schools to use and made it very complex. School leaders have a lot on their plate but if it was straightforward many more would have accessed it by now,” he said. Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, who was lobbying for a national tutoring scheme before the pandemic hit, said: “Tutoring is huge business in this country because of the middle-class demand. But the big problem is consistency. How high-quality are these tutors? It’s not just about numbers, it is about how good they are.” A spokesperson for Randstad said: “We understand the importance of the NTP and take the responsibility of running it seriously. We ensure that all tuition providers accepted on to the NTP framework have successfully passed the robust quality, safeguarding and evaluation standards set by the DfE.” Professor Becky Francis, chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation, said there was clear evidence that one-to-one and small group tutoring could lead to four to five months of progress for pupils. But she warned that “it does need to be high quality to have an impact”. The EEF enrolled 125,000 pupils in its first three months of running the programme in 2020, which was half of their target for the whole year. Having met their targets for the first year, it was widely expected that the charity would be tasked with running the programme. Francis declined to comment on Randstad’s failure to meet its targets, but said: “I feel very proud of what we achieved in the first year.”",News/Education,‘I’ve got one word for the tutoring programme – disastrous’: UK catch-up scheme mired in problems,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/13/ive-got-one-word-for-the-tutoring-programme-disastrous
2/13/2022,"The government is poised to terminate the contract of the Dutch multinational company it hired to run its flagship national tutoring programme (NTP), after official figures revealed the scheme was falling far short of its targets, sources close to the education department have told the Observer. The £1.5bn programme was set up to help pupils across England whose learning has been most disrupted by the pandemic. But the Observer understands that the Department for Education has been holding meetings in the past two weeks to discuss replacing Randstad, which has so far met only 10% of its target for children receiving one-to-one or small-group tutoring from NTP tuition partners.  Many heads are strongly in favour of the idea of offering tutoring to families that would not normally be able to afford private tuition. But their feedback on the way the programme has been running under Randstad is damning. Schools have reported tutoring companies cancelling lessons just before they are due to start, tutors failing to arrive, and tutorials being run by people with no knowledge of the subject they are teaching. Schools also say that the main web platform is “bureaucratic and too difficult to use”. A senior education source involved in the discussion over the future of the programme said: “There has been a lot of discussion behind the scenes. A rival bid from tutoring organisations has been made and this is being seriously considered by officials and ministers.” The source said that they were expecting the department to make an announcement in a matter of weeks. Sam Freedman, senior adviser to the education charity Ark and a former senior policy adviser to Michael Gove when he was education secretary, said that the department’s contracts usually had a “tight performance commitment”. “I can’t imagine Randstad is hitting the performance targets, and from what I’ve heard they will have the ability to kick them out.” He added: “It would make sense to give a grant to the charities to run it. The [tutoring] charities are furious. Some haven’t been paid by Randstad.” It is widely expected that the National Audit Office will conduct an investigation into the NTP, and Freedman said: “If ministers have been shown what is going wrong and not acted on it, that will make things much worse for them.” Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, said: “What is happening with the NTP would be a national scandal if we weren’t all so diverted by partygate and I hope there will be a public inquiry. It is a lot of public money but, more importantly, it is a battle for the futures of a whole generation of children.” The education select committee is already undertaking an inquiry into what has gone wrong in the delivery of the programme. School leaders have told the committee that the programme is “a bureaucratic nightmare”. This week, its chair, Robert Halfon, said that the government should “seriously consider” revoking Randstad’s contract. He said that he feared the funding “is not reaching the most vulnerable children in our communities”. Writing for the Conservative Home website, he quoted research showing that more than 96% of schools in the south had worked with the NTP, but that only 50% of schools in the north had. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of the National Association for Head Teachers union, said: “Every child in every school in every part of the country should be able to access tutoring support if they need it regardless of their family income. It is exasperating to see something that could be so transformational falling flat.” He said: “It all needs to be made simple and easy for schools to access. The most obvious solution would be to give a single tutoring grant to schools and let them choose to go to a tuition partner or employ their own tutors.” A spokesperson for Randstad said: “We understand the importance of the national tutoring programme and take the responsibility of running it seriously.” The DfE was asked to comment but declined.",News/Education,Firm behind England’s flagship tuition scheme faces dismissal after failing to hit targets,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/13/tuition-programme-england-falling-behind-pupils-in-disarray
2/13/2022,"The Danish French film-maker Jonas Poher Rasmussen’s animated documentary, in which a middle-aged academic living in Denmark relives his flight from Afghanistan as a boy, is shaping up as a major awards contender. Within the past fortnight, it has been nominated for best animated feature and best documentary at both the Baftas and Oscars, with an additional Academy Award nod for best international feature. It’s easy to see why the film has touched a nerve. Addressing difficult subject matter in a manner that is at once emotionally engaging and stylistically adventurous, Flee follows in the footsteps of Ari Folman’s 2008 animated awards-winner Waltz With Bashir, about his experiences and memories of the 1982 Lebanon war, proving once again that genuinely “true life” storytelling requires as much artistry and invention as any drama. Drawing on his background in radio documentaries, Rasmussen conducted a lengthy series of intimate interviews with the pseudonymously renamed “Amin Nawabi” whom he had known since middle school, but who had kept his past to himself. I’ll leave it to the film to explain why Amin’s story remained untold for so long; suffice to say that there is a palpable air of discovery as Rasmussen’s subject gradually reveals himself, finally giving voice to traumas that had long been hidden.  Key to Amin’s openness is the animated format that allows him to speak about his life without sacrificing his anonymity. His memories are vivid, packed with the kind of details that transfer beautifully to the screen: flying kites and listening to music on headphones on the streets of Kabul; gazing with dawning longing at posters of Jean-Claude Van Damme; witnessing his father’s stoical courage when the mujahideen come calling. These scenes are rendered in sharp, unfussy 2D animation that at times reminded me of the boldly accessible images of the Belgian cartoonist Hergé or the rapturous melancholia of the UK-based Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit (The Red Turtle). Such clarity gives way to something altogether more impressionistic and abstract as Amin recalls the horrors endured as he and his family fled Afghanistan for Moscow and beyond. While news stories detailing the unspeakable ordeals faced by desperate refugees have become appallingly commonplace, Amin’s account of human trafficking is dramatically amplified by the nightmarish images conjured up by Copenhagen-based Sun Creature Studio. Whether it’s phantasmagorical visions of drowning as an overcrowded boat hits a storm or the claustrophobia of being trapped in a sealed cargo container, Flee had my palms sweating with anxiety during its most harrowing sequences. Yet what emerges from this remarkable story is not a tale of victimhood but, rather, a coming-of-age narrative that covers a lifetime. Amin is physically displaced by the events of his early life, and his sense of identity has been similarly fractured. In the film’s opening movement we learn that Amin (who is in his mid-30s) is struggling to accept the prospect of an idyllic life in a rural home with his long-term partner, Kasper. Does the key to unlocking the future lie in confronting the ghosts of the past? That is certainly how it appears, as Flee traces an arc from secrecy to openness that seems to signal a great unburdening. No wonder Rasmussen gives his subject an “original screenplay” credit – this is a triumph-of-the-human-spirit story as dramatic as the most finely wrought melodrama, with flashes of vintage newsreels reminding us that it is all “real”. Just as Max Richter’s haunting score proved such a powerful part of Waltz With Bashir, so the Swedish composer Uno Helmersson provides a lyrical accompaniment to Amin’s story, his spine-tingling cues (featuring the violinist Mari Samuelsen) rubbing shoulders with pop tracks that play a transformative role. I’d never been a fan of Norwegian chart-toppers A-ha before, but having seen Flee I now cannot get their anthemic Take on Me (the video for which famously blended live-action with animation) out of my head. In UK cinemas, Flee (on which Riz Ahmed gets an executive producer credit) is being released in subtitled and dubbed versions. I have seen the former and would strongly recommend it, although anything that widens the film’s mainstream appeal is to be applauded.",Arts/Film,Flee review – an Afghan refugee confronts his past in masterly animated documentary,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/13/flee-review-an-afghan-refugee-confronts-his-past-in-masterly-animated-documentary-jonas-poher-rasmussen
2/13/2022,"Does this happen to every generation? Where a cultural moment that, during our adolescence appeared deliciously shocking, is revealed to us in adulthood as, at best “troubling”, at worst a grim representation of how the world is cracked down the middle, a thick and low-humming oil dripping from its wound? I realise now what a naive girl I must have been, to have accepted without daily outrage such clumsy horrors as the media’s addiction to Amy Winehouse’s addictions and Britney Spears’s breakdown, and I choose “naive” rather than “cruel”, because this week has been tough enough. But today, entering middle-age tired and thoughtful, I remain grateful for the ongoing trend for films and TV shows produced as correctives to those decades of casual cruelty, partly for the answers they give, and partly for the questions they leave me with.  The latest is Pam & Tommy, a scripted mini-series about the scandal that unfolded in the mid-1990s after Pamela Anderson and her new husband Tommy Lee’s sex video was stolen from their Malibu home. It does something awkward which its sister-ish piece, Impeachment (Ryan Murphy’s show about Monica Lewinsky), didn’t – it lures an audience in by starting as a screwball romp with a heist and a penis that talks back, then, with scenes of the bloodthirsty deposition when Lee and a pregnant Anderson tried to stop Penthouse from using the tape (“Do you recall how old you were when you first publicly exposed your genitals?”) sinking into something harder, a reckoning. “It’s not funny,” Anderson told Jay Leno on The Tonight Show in 1996. “This is devastating to us.” We’re left feeling that it’s a kind of miracle she is still standing, having seen what experiences like this – ridicule, constant surveillance, objectification – can do to a young woman. The sense of entitlement the public felt to the intimate life of this couple has endured and exploded beyond celebrity. Soon after their safe was stolen by a disgruntled electrician, the internet arrived, and quickly became its own kind of safe, now full of everybody’s videos, whether nudes, babies or dinner. What Anderson would have been shocked to learn back then, as she was forced to meet humiliation and misogyny with the wide bright smile of an air hostess, was that two-and-a-half decades later many millions would willingly share similar videos every day. When the mini-series finishes, the reckonings keep wrecking, as we sit with the fact that both Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson declined to be involved. It’s been reported that Anderson finds it “shocking” the series has been made without her consent. “Pamela has no regrets about her life, but the only thing she would probably erase is this burglary,” said “a source” last month. “She feels so violated to this day. It brings back a very painful time for her.” Could the retelling of the story, including a dramatisation of Anderson miscarrying, prove just as harmful to her as the story itself? This is the lemon that sours the drink. It’s fabulous that discussions about objectification, invasions of privacy and abuses of power are being ignited by glossy TV shows, and that viewers like me are being prodded to question our own complicity. But we’re a couple of years into the project now, and they’ve only got us so far. For all the focus on feminism online and its mainstreaming in the media, the world’s politics have not kept up. Rape and sexual assault appears basically legal – only 1.3% of rape cases are now being prosecuted, recorded rapes and sexual offences in England and Wales have “hit a record high” and we’re learning about a multitude of cases where women are suffering at the hands of police supposed to protect them. Across the world, women’s abortion rights are being snatched away. Decades after Anderson and Lee’s sex tape, the posting of nude images of women without their consent is rife, but unlike revenge porn, it is legal – a report by the Revenge Porn Helpline calls it “collector culture,” as the pictures are traded like football cards. That issue of consent – the idea that Pamela Anderson might feel violated not just by the ripples still felt by the exploitation of her “sex tape”, but by the world revisiting it today – is illustrative of how talking can be prioritised over action. Producers must have felt hers was too good a story not to tell – meaning the story ceased to be hers. It’s a funny kind of entertainment, a comedy caper about misogyny that features a talking penis, and leaves you awake at 4am, guilt and a little rage rattling through your throat. But the discomfort is a reminder. If what seemed funny then seems disgraceful now, then something is clear: the actions we take today will look very different to the next generation, looking afresh at the world and ready to find their own cracks.

2/13/2022,"The Metropolitan Police is investigating death threats against Keir Starmer made in the wake of Boris Johnson’s accusation that he “failed to prosecute” Jimmy Savile. A cache of evidence documenting the threats was sent to Scotland Yard on Friday afternoon, including a number of apparently identifiable users on the messaging app Telegram who called for the Labour party leader to be hung or “executed”.  The Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which seeks to disrupt online hate, sent the material to the Met after unearthing threats to life against a named individual. It is understood that Starmer’s office has a separate system where concerning material is passed to the police to assess. Starmer and shadow foreign secretary David Lammy were ambushed by far-right protesters last week, some of whom shouted “traitor” and “Jimmy Savile”. Starmer blamed Boris Johnson for inciting the attack, saying he had never been accused in public of being a “paedophile protector” until the prime minister falsely accused him of failing to prosecute Savile when director of public prosecutions. Prior to the emergence of the threats, which have been seen by the Observer, a number of Tory MPs had raised concerns that the false slur by the prime minister had endangered Starmer. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH, called for tighter controls on Telegram and said the murders of Jo Cox in 2016 and David Amess last year should serve as a warning. “Two sitting MPs have been murdered in the last six years. Telegram has made a calculated business decision to allow users to egg each other on to violence against named politicians with zero consequences, just as they allow anti-vaxxers, incels and other fringe extremists to congregate on their platform. “Fundamentally, this is a national security threat and we need to act fast.” Starmer was returning to parliament on Monday with Lammy when they had to be bundled into a police car after anti-vax protesters surrounded them with shouts of “paedo protector” and “Jimmy Savile”. Following the incident, English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, shared footage of the ambush on his Telegram channel, prompting a supporter to call for Starmer and Lammy to be detained “until preparation can be made for their execution”. The conspiracy theory group Resistance GB, also showed footage of the incident, leading a supporter to post that Starmer should be “linched [sic] from the nearest lamppost”. Footage of the incident was distributed on another Telegram channel leading to further calls for Starmer and Lammy to be killed. “The sooner they’s all dead the better. Hang the fucking lot of them,” read one post. Another added “They can all swing on a rope together.” A separate user posted: “They all need to feel the heat of a rope around their neck.” Another Tommy Robinson supporter posted on the “free speech” social media platform Gettr site “bring back public executions” in reference to Starmer. Responding to the developments, a Labour source said: “Of course extremists of all stripes don’t like Keir – he spent years helping to put them and their ilk in prison and keep Britain’s streets safe from them.” Adam Hadley, executive director and founder of Tech Against Terrorism, an initiative launched by the UN counter-terrorism executive directorate, said the harassment of Starmer and Lammy demonstrated the danger of politicians legitimising conspiracy theories. “Conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists appear to be emboldened by this physical attack on the Labour leader. We have seen multiple posts since Monday that celebrate the incident, some with tens of thousands of views,” Hadley said. Among the far-right groups that praised last week’s accosting of Starmer were anti-Muslim extremists Britain First, the neo-Nazi Mark Collett who called the Labour leader a “paedophile protector”, and an organisation linked to football hooligans and the EDL. Tech Against Terrorism also found death threats with a Tommy Robinson supporter saying Labour MPs “need hanging”. Ahmed said: “Every time a violent extremist makes a threat of violence and gets away with it, the norms of those groups worsen, and others are driven to newer depths of behaviour.” ",News/UK news,Met investigates death threats against Keir Starmer in wake of Johnson’s Savile slur,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/13/met-investigates-death-threats-against-keir-starmer-in-wake-of-johnsons-savile-slur
2/13/2022,"Istill own a painting that I purchased at a flea market in Los Angeles in 1993. I got it cheap; $25 and it was in the back of my clapped-out convertible . It turned out to be a copy of Bronzino’s Portrait of a Young Man with a Book. In 16th-century Florence, if you wanted your portrait painted then he was your man, for one simple reason: he made you look great. His particular gift – and shrewd commercial decision – was to imbue his wealthy subjects with swagger, confidence and even a certain weight loss. Three centuries before you could sit before a photographer and more than four before you could take a selfie, rich Florentines would sit still for days and trust that Bronzino would do for them what he’d done for their wealthy neighbours, for Dante. It paid to flatter.  In recent years, I’ve had, as a screenwriter, to wrestle with the extent to which the artist should or should not seek to serve the vanity of the subject and have now done so across an array of “sitters”, from popes Francis and Benedict to Stephen Hawking… and now Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. I take it as self-evident that I am serving art, not biography; that the facts alone, as far as they can ever be known, will simply not do. Where’s the room for interpretation, for “my” depiction? These issues were very much on my mind when I began to write my play about Warhol and Basquiat, two men with carefully managed personas. How could I capture them whole – not as they wished to be seen but in a way that tells us something we don’t already know, precisely because they didn’t want us to know. In the case of Warhol you might almost say that he was all persona. His greatest creation was his own image. His journey, from pale runt out of steel-town America to wig-wearing aesthete presiding over American art, was one entirely of painful self-creation. He thought art should do no more than give you a nice little hit, “like when you see a celebrity in the street”. It should purely be about surfaces because, as such, it reflected that modern life had become all surface, no substance. Basquiat also barely said boo in public. He was the first high-profile black painter America had ever seen and was young when he became famous, so young it almost hurt. In fact, his fame did hurt.. The attention that came so quickly overwhelmed him as the money rolled in and he tried to maintain his air of hobo chic, of smack-addicted street artist turned gallery genius in paint-spattered Armani suits. Although he did sleep rough on the busted streets of New York’s Lower East Side when he first crossed the river from Brooklyn, his father was actually a successful accountant and he had lived in a brownstone house for his entire childhood and been educated in an expensive private school. Here, again, persona meets reality and produces a tantalising shortfall. So, how do you get under the hood of such types who, we can assume, would rather sit for a Bronzino than a Lucian Freud? In the case of Warhol, a quick read of his diaries helped convince me that I could create, on stage, a mouthy Andy, a rivalrous Andy, a take-no-prisoners talker. For here, in his entries, was a character totally different from any I’d seen drawn: a gossip, a torrential name-dropper and popper of bubble reputations who was every bit as bitchy as his one-time crush, Truman Capote. Basquiat was a tougher nut to crack in that there is very little extant of his utterances and beliefs. And yet we have the thousand paintings he left before his death from an accidental heroin overdose, aged 27. From these, I figured, a depiction could be made. The paintings, I feel, tell us a great deal about the burden that he shouldered. His works teem with a playful but troubled questioning, inviting us to conclude that, unlike Warhol, he believed in the power of art to transform the artist and the viewer. So, if someone in my position is to offer anything worthwhile beyond biography, strict rules must be observed. The portrait must be drawn from deep research (sorry, Bronzino) but it can’t give up its interpretive responsibilities. Whether we’re talking about unreliable entries left behind in a diary or just obscure markings on a canvas, real lives can still be discerned in the mists.

2/13/2022,"The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian charity worker detained in Iran, has said she is “very, very angry” after learning about the collapse of a deal to bring her home. Zaghari-Ratcliffe fears she is a “bargaining chip” in ongoing nuclear talks and is filled with “anger at her life being stolen” and the government’s “lack of urgency” in securing her release, Richard Ratcliffe said.  The 43-year-old, from West Hampstead in London, was jailed for five years in 2016 after being convicted on national security charges for plotting to topple the Iranian government, which she has always denied. She was released temporarily in 2020 during the Covid pandemic, but was handed a further sentence in 2021 for “spreading propaganda” and is held under house arrest in Tehran, unable to return to the UK to join her husband and seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella. On Wednesday, MPs were told the UK had signed an agreement to secure her release in the summer, but that the deal had fallen through. Officials had previously refused to confirm that any agreement had been made, but when questioned about it by the couple’s MP, Tulip Siddiq, the prime minister did not deny it. Britain is understood to have agreed to repay a £400m debt it owes Iran relating to an abortive deal to export British armaments in the 1970s. The UK government has not revealed why the agreement about Zaghari-Ratcliffe broke down, but there are fears it is linked to negotiations with Iran over nuclear weapons. Iran is engaged in talks in Vienna with diplomats from the US, France, Germany, Russia, China and the UK, who hope to persuade it to limit its sensitive nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. In response to Siddiq’s question, Boris Johnson said the debt was “difficult to settle and square away for all sorts of reasons to do with sanctions”. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was able to watch the debate from Tehran, where she is under house arrest at her mother’s property. “In some ways she’s all isolated and far removed from the world, but she can see it now in a way that when she was in prison she couldn’t,” Ratcliffe said. While the confirmation that a deal was nearly struck in the summer had left him feeling hopeful, “for Nazanin, it really all rushed back that actually this has been dragged on for ages and she’s lost six years of her life”. He said his wife was “amazed” by the prime minister’s comments. She told him: “I could have been home last year. Why am I still here? They have ruined my life, day by day, for six years. Where is [Johnson’s] urgency? I just want to come home.” The next day she was “even crosser” after “stewing on the injustice”. “She’s calmer now,” he said yesterday, adding that they had spent the morning going through Gabriella’s baby photos together. Johnson has publicly pledged to meet Ratcliffe, an accountant who has campaigned tirelessly for his wife’s release, although a date for the meeting has yet to be fixed. Ratcliffe is expected to meet officials from the Foreign Office in the coming days. Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, has urged transparency about the reasons for the collapse of the deal. “My constituent, Richard, starved himself almost to death during a hunger strike. He didn’t eat for three weeks. I think they have a duty to explain themselves,” she said. Ratcliffe said: “Why did it go wrong? What’s stopping it from being solved now? I worry we’ve become a bargaining chip in the nuclear negotiations and that the debt is now leverage on the UK side.” He added: “We’re essentially being held in a waiting room. It’s a game of cat and mouse being played.” A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We remain committed to securing the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Anoosheh Ashoori and Morad Tahbaz. It is unhelpful to connect wider bilateral issues with those unfairly detained in Iran. “Separately, the UK has always said we are committed to paying this debt to Iran. We continue to explore options as a matter of urgency to resolve this case, and will not comment further as discussions are ongoing.”",News/News,Zaghari-Ratcliffe ‘angry at her life being stolen’ after deal for release collapses,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/13/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-release-deal-collapses
