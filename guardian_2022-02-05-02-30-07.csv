2/5/2022,"My friend Richard Wheeler, who has died aged 77, was an Anglican priest and social reformer who believed the church had a duty to support and represent disadvantaged people. He worked in Brixton in south London in the 1970s, in the midst of tensions between black young people and the police, and became a race adviser to the British Council of Churches. Richard was born and brought up in Eltham, south London, the son of Charles Wheeler, chauffeur to the chief executive of London Underground, and his wife, Emily (nee Strawson), a homemaker. He attended Haberdashers’ Aske’s grammar school, New Cross, and trained for the priesthood at King’s College London, graduating with a BD in 1972.  His first post was as curate at St Matthew’s, Brixton. He stayed at the church for nearly a decade, and managed a space in the church called the Meeting Place, where community activities were held. He found himself at the centre of mounting conflict between the black community and the police over the frequent stopping and arrest of black youths under stop and search powers, known as the Sus laws. This tension culminated in the Brixton riots of 1981. Richard believed the Church of England had a responsibility to support disadvantaged people and those who had suffered injustice – this drove his work. He was an adviser on race relations to the British Council of Churches from 1980 to 1983. In 1983 Richard moved with his young family to Southampton to work as part of a team ministry in the city centre. One of the things he did there was to open up church buildings for wider community use. He was elected to the C of E’s ruling body, the General Synod, from 1985 to 1990, and spoke in favour of the ordination of women. Two women were appointed to the clergy at his church. Richard’s final move was to St Albans Cathedral in 1998 as a canon. One of his roles there was to help set up the East of England Churches Network, a project sharing ideas between faith communities on how they can contribute to civil society. He retired in 2009 and moved back to Eltham, where he enjoyed gardening and reading fiction, philosophy and politics. He studied for an MA in theology at Heythrop College, University of London, and was a member of the Forum for Discussion of Israel and Palestine. He visited Palestine in 2013 and he was a supporter of the Medical Aid for Palestinians charity. He was at heart a reformer but also valued the Anglo Catholic traditions of prayer and contemplation. He had great humanity, borne out especially in his own struggles with depression. He was an empathic pastoral priest and a loyal friend. Richard is survived by his wife, Frances (nee Blake), whom he married in 1975, and their sons, Patrick and James, by a son, Stephen, from an earlier marriage that ended in divorce, by three grandchildren and his siblings, David and Janet.",News/World news,The Rev Richard Wheeler obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/the-rev-richard-wheeler-obituary
2/5/2022,"That sound you can hear is the whirr of 650 adding machines. At Westminster, MPs are totting up the costs, tallying the benefits and working out the balance of their own interests. On the Tory benches, they know a moment of decision is coming but they can’t be sure that moment is now. Does the resignation in disgust by one of Boris Johnson’s most loyal lieutenants signal the end times, or was Munira Mirza a backroom aide no voter had ever heard of? What if both things are true? They think, chiefly, about their own seats. Their inboxes are bulging with constituents’ fury, but they hesitate before casting aside the winner of their biggest election victory for more than 30 years. Some long for the dilemma to be resolved for them, perhaps by a development so dramatic – police action or the emergence of a damning photograph, or if an unexpurgated Sue Gray report turns out to be full of what one ex-minister calls “tawdry detail” – that a consensus will rapidly form that the Johnson show is over. The bandwagon will start rolling and they’ll be able to jump on it safely. But what if there is no such moment of clarity?  The minds of those at the top click and whirr with their own reckonings. The two current frontrunners have different views of time. It would suit Rishi Sunak for things to come to a head soon: he needs a leadership contest to happen before his brand is permanently tainted by the cost-of-living crisis, surging energy bills, painful tax rises and increased interest rates. Witness the front pages of the Telegraph and the Sun putting Sunak’s face alongside the words “The big squeeze” and “OUCH!” Liz Truss is happy for things to drag on for the very same reason. Labour is hardly a disinterested observer. It, too, is consulting its electoral calculator, looking at polls that show Keir Starmer ahead of Johnson, with the outlook less certain if the Tories pull off their old trick of picking a new boss and claiming to be a new government. Talk to Westminster folk and you will pick up all these noises. But all too few MPs, certainly on the Conservative benches, realise that they’re listening to the wrong part of their brains. For this stopped being a matter of calculation weeks ago. It should instead be a matter of conscience. That was true as soon as it became obvious that Johnson broke the very lockdown rules he had imposed on everyone else. But one incident this week made it clearer still. The clarity came from a single remark thrown across the dispatch box by Johnson as he sought to deflect attention from the Sue Gray “update” that, even in its gagged form, confirmed “failures of leadership” at No 10. In that remark, Johnson revealed that he is a man who will do or say anything to cling to power, no matter the cost. There is no depth to which he will not sink. The words were directed at Starmer, whom Johnson accused of “failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. As Mirza wrote, this was a “scurrilous accusation”, as well as “an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse”. It was also demonstrably false. Nazir Afzal, a former colleague at the Crown Prosecution Service, which Starmer led between 2008 and 2013, has said that the key decision on the Savile case was taken by others before Starmer ever got there. Johnson knew that. That’s why Mirza and others had begged him not to make such an accusation. But Johnson did it anyway. No one can pretend to be surprised. This has been part of the Johnson modus operandi for years. He didn’t need Lynton Crosby to teach him about dead cats. He himself spoke openly about his technique: when besieged by scandal, the best defence is more scandal. Keep throwing out “chaff”, make ever more outrageous statements, which the press will dutifully report and, before you know it, everyone will have forgotten your original misdemeanour. Those Tory MPs deluding themselves that Johnson will change, that he now “gets it”, need to face the reality that Johnson will keep doing this – not least because it works. For much of the last week, we were indeed talking not about parties and cake, but Starmer and Savile – those two words unwarrantedly and falsely linked in the same sentence, repeated on news bulletins and phone-in shows, sneaking past the unwary listener and settling in a part of the collective brain where the specifics and the truth soon become hazy. It was the same with £350m and the EU, the very falsity of the proposition ensuring its repetition and amplification. The effect is poison. For the Savile-Starmer lie has long been a meme on the wilder shores of the conspiracy-theorist far right, where it echoes the QAnon lunacy with its suggestion of a governing elite secretly protecting the abusers of children. Johnson was giving a validating wink to that hate-filled fringe, just as Donald Trump gave a friendly nod to QAnon or the Proud Boys. Johnson’s Savile move was classic Trump. For once a lie is out of the mouth of a national leader, it will be repeated by those whose salaries depend on his favour. Note the dispiriting interview with the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, in which she refused to acknowledge the truth on Savile and Starmer, telling her interviewer “I only have your word for it”, as if provable facts were merely subjective opinions. Dorries was doing for Johnson what Kellyanne Conway did for Trump, creating a realm of “alternative facts”. This is the damage Johnson does. He did it a second time on Monday, randomly and without evidence suggesting that drug-taking was rife on the Labour frontbench. On Thursday, the UK Statistics Authority had to rebuke Johnson for falsely claiming crime was down when it is in fact up. The Savile smear was a demonstration of how low Johnson is prepared to go. He did not care that his remark would fuel ever greater distrust not merely in Starmer or Labour, but in the public sphere. Nor did he fear the corrosion that comes when a society cannot agree on a shared basis of evidence and truth, the slow death that is inflicted on democracy when each warring political tribe has its own “facts”. He did not and does not care about any of that. If he is to be driven from the temple, he will bring down the temple. He will scorch the earth. Conservative MPs now owe it to the country they claim to love to put aside their electoral calculations and remove this man before he brings yet more ruin.

2/5/2022,"Ever since it was insisted that Netflix had single-handledly resurrected the romantic comedy despite the general hideousness of the romcoms they were releasing, streamers have churned them out by the dozen, quality be damned. As Valentine’s Day looms, with Netflix still basking in the success of last month’s The Royal Treatment, the next week will see the teen sequel Tall Girl 2 and Turkish offering Love Tactics also added to its catalogue. At the same time, Amazon will launch the Jenny Slate-Charlie Day comedy I Want You Back and Universal will give Marry Me, J-Lo’s glossy return to the genre, a hybrid cinema-Peacock launch. It’s a theoretical feast for fans, but here’s naively hoping that they’re a damn sight better than this week’s misfiring trifle Book of Love (dropping on Amazon in the US and on Sky in the UK), a colourless background watch that never once attempts to make itself worthy of more focused attention.  It’s a shame, as there’s a decent enough set-up. Henry (Sam Claflin) is an uptight British writer whose latest book, The Sensible Heart – a sexless and meek romance novel appealing to precisely no one – has flopped in his homeland. But he’s encouraged to hear from his agent (Lucy Punch, bizarrely sporting an American accent) that it’s been a hit in Mexico and so he’s sent on a book tour, partnered with Maria (Verónica Echegui), the woman who translated his work. It soon transpires though that Maria did more than just translate – she virtually rewrote it, adding the heat and eroticism his original failed to include. The two then go from sparring partners to lovers but without the necessary legwork to make us believe a lick of it. Hailing from BuzzFeed studios (which means that the site already features an article declaring it “one of the best romcoms” based solely on the trailer) but co-scripted by novelist and Veep writer David Quantick, Book of Love arrives with a strange mismatched pedigree. But the end result features none of the poppy vim of the former or the sharp wit of the latter. It is a flatly directed and utterly, aggressively un-engaging piece of fluff that only serves to remind us of other, better and more picturesque examples of the travelogue romantic comedy (save yourself and rewatch Only You, French Kiss or Two for the Road instead). There’s certainly nothing wrong with sticking to the familiar genre beats we all know so well, but there needs to be a light-footed charm ushering us from one to the next, and director Analeine Cal y Mayor fails to muster up even a shred of it. While Claflin sticks to a lazily traced-over impression of the buttoned-up romcom Englishman archetype, there is at least some energy from the other side as Echegui tries hard to make her single mother turned wannabe novelist into a real human being. She’s easily the best thing here and one wonders what a film centered around her slightly more textured character might have been, unshackled from the rote machinations that push her into a hard-to-stomach romance with a mostly unlikable lead. The script forces them together far too fast, all tension melting despite a stark dearth of chemistry, and clumsy last-act attempts at conflict feel minor and haphazard. Romantic comedies are expected to be contrived and far-fetched – it’s a genre that allows for a lot of exceptions – but they really shouldn’t be this dull.

2/5/2022,"Michael Gove ignored repeated warnings that the “Trojan horse” allegations of an extremist takeover of schools in Birmingham was “bogus” and pressed ahead with divisive interventions, according to evidence revealed in a New York Times podcast. A briefing in February 2014 for Gove, then education secretary, by Birmingham city council, said it had found “a serious credibility gap” regarding the anonymous letter, saying it contained “serious factual inaccuracies and, in a number of areas, contradictions”, in allegations of an Islamist plot to subvert state schools in the city.  The evidence collected by Hamza Syed and Brian Reed, two journalists working on the podcast, reignites the controversy surrounding the alleged plot, which triggered a series of raids, takeovers and turmoil in schools in central Birmingham with high proportions of Muslim pupils. But despite investigations made by the government, Ofsted and Birmingham council – including one by Peter Clarke, a former national head of counter-terrorism, commissioned by Gove – the origins of the letter have never been discovered, and little or no evidence of a concerted plot or radicalisation of pupils was ever established. The eight-part podcast, The Trojan Horse Affair, said Gove was also told that Birmingham city council’s independent auditors had investigated allegations against schools named in the Trojan horse letter. According to the briefing given to Gove, the audit “had come to a clear view there was no basis” for the allegations. Sir Albert Bore, the leader of Birmingham local authority at the time, supplied the journalists with notes of his meeting with Gove on 12 February 2014, before the Trojan horse letter had reached the national media. The notes show that Gove was told that the recommendation of the West Midlands police, including its counter-terrorism unit, was that the letter was “bogus”. However the letter circulated within Whitehall became a flashpoint between Gove and Theresa May, the then home secretary, who privately berated Gove for failing to act. Shortly afterwards, the letter reached the national media, at a time when fears of British Muslims travelling to fight alongside Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were high. Asked to respond, a government spokesperson said: “We make no apology for working to protect young people from all forms of harm. All children, from whatever background and no matter what challenges they face, deserve a safe environment in which they can learn. “The Trojan horse investigation led by Peter Clarke rightly focused on whether the events and behaviours that were alleged actually happened, and the findings have subsequently been confirmed by a number of independent reports.” A high-profile disciplinary hearing against senior leaders at one school, Park View, collapsed after flaws were exposed in the government’s legal handling, costing the Department for Education hundreds of thousands of pounds in fees. The podcast’s journalists also obtained a copy of Birmingham city council’s audit report into events at Adderley primary school in Saltley, Birmingham, which is covered in great detail within the Trojan horse letter. The independent auditors investigated an employment dispute between four teaching assistants and the head of Adderley school, Rizvana Darr, including claims by the teaching assistants that resignation letters in their names accepted by the school had been forged. Concerns over the tribunal and the council’s investigation led to a rift between Adderley school and the council. But after the Trojan horse letter emerged, Birmingham council officially retracted the audit report and restored its backing to Adderley’s legal defence. Birmingham city council also threatened the podcast journalists with an injunction if they used or published the independent audit report. The podcast concludes without any firm evidence of the Trojan horse letter’s author or origin, but says the timing of the letter’s appearance coincides with the legal difficulties between the council and Adderley school – suggesting it may have been intended to influence the employment tribunal. Birmingham city council and Adderley school were approached for comment. Bore and Gove were approached for comment.",News/Politics,Gove acted on ‘bogus’ allegations of Islamist plot to take over Birmingham schools,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/michael-gove-acted-on-bogus-allegations-of-islamist-plot-to-take-over-birmingham-schools
2/5/2022,"We’ve been here before, haven’t we? A year out from a World Cup and on the eve of a Six Nations Championship, Ireland look capable of beating any side they face. Andy Farrell’s relentless commitment to keeping the ball in play saw them average more passes - 187.4 - and more rucks in possession – 113.1 – per game than any other team competing in the Six Nations or Rugby Championship last year. Commanding wins against England and New Zealand proved they can marry flair with fortitude. The 29-20 triumph over the All Blacks was particularly impressive, likely the best performance from Ireland under Farrell. By committing two men to every breakdown they risk losing the ball on the ground but they keep 11 players on their feet and free to attack. The image of New Zealand’s Codie Taylor and Dalton Papalii looking shattered before the half-time break in the autumn told a story. This is the result of Ireland’s frenetic philosophy.  Wales aren’t too dissimilar in their approach. Both teams utilise a 1-3-2-2 formation, staggering pods of forwards across the width of the pitch. But Ireland are more consistent, more devoted to the ideology and rarely stray too far from it. This has a lot to do with the man standing at first receiver. Johnny Sexton, captaining the team in his 102nd appearance for his country at 36, is as solid as any fly-half in the world and is metronomic in his delivery. Though he can straighten the line and is dangerous when deploying a give-and-go with a midfielder in what has been dubbed the “Sexton loop”, his game is defined by reliability and consistency. In many ways he encapsulates all that is good about this Irish unit. He is also one of 11 Leinster representatives in the starting 15. His partner at scrum-half, Jamison Gibson-Park, is also his club teammate; as are seven of the starting forwards that have gelled into one of the most cohesive packs in the game with a powerful scrum and maul game at their disposal. By contrast all four Welsh clubs are represented in the Welsh pack. That is the least of Wayne Pivac’s concerns as he has made the trip to Dublin without Alun Wyn Jones, Josh Navidi, Justin Tipuric, Ken Owens, Leigh Halfpenny, George North and Taulupe Faletau. Winger Josh Adams is starting at outside centre for the first time at this level and eight of their 12 match-day forwards have less than 30 Test caps. Pivac has conceded that his team are underdogs as memories of the 54-10 hammering at Lansdowne Road in 2002 have come into focus. Back then another Kiwi coach lost his job as Graham Henry was sacked after the record defeat. Dan Biggar, however, isn’t bothered by what others are saying. The Northampton Saints fly-half will captain Wales for the first time and pointed out that being written off before a ball has been kicked is a familiar feeling. “We always start as fourth or fifth favourites every year we come into the Six Nations Behind the big three [England, Ireland and France],” Biggar pointed out. “I think Scotland are ahead of us in the bookies this week. It’s been the same for the last ten years. But people forget that we’ve been the most successful team for the last 10 years, winning it four times. For us it’s no different coming into the tournament as underdogs. Whether we’ve won it the year before or we have a full strength team, half a team missing, whatever it is, it’s the same. We’re just looking forward to the challenge and getting into a real arm wrestle with Ireland.” Rain and wind has been forecast which means an arm wrestle is likely. Sexton and Biggar will likely go to the boot and test which back-three can gain control. Louis Rees-Zammit boasted that he is getting faster but this will be the first time the 21-year-old is playing in front of a packed partisan crowd in the Six Nations and will doubtless be a target. The same will be true for Ireland’s Mack Hansen making his debut on the opposite wing. The Australian-born 23-year-old has only played nine games for Connacht since joining from the Brumbies last month though his selection barely caused a stir. This has something to do with six tries in that time but mostly because Farrell has earned the trust of his players and those who support them. Something special is brewing. The next 18 months could be the most significant in Ireland’s history. “We’d all love a trophy,” Farrell said before stressing that silverware would “look after themselves” if the team stuck to their principles and processes. Perhaps so. But after ending 2021 on a high, and stealing the breath from defenders and fans alike, a trophy must now be considered a non-negotiable. A Six Nations crown would be nice. A World Cup would be better. First they have to put Wales away.",Sport/Sport,Ireland’s frenetic philosophy meets Welsh grit in Six Nations arm wrestle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/irelands-frenetic-philosophy-meets-welsh-grit-in-six-nations-arm-wrestle
2/5/2022,"In British politics, and nowhere more so than in Downing Street, trust between political advisers and their principals is at a premium. Once advisers have hitched themselves to a star, they tend to stay hitched. The sense of being bound by a common cause, jointly confronting an unsympathetic media, unresponsive institutions, a cynical party and unforgiving events is a powerful glue. There is no substitute for being up close and personal when a prime minister faces agonising choices for which there is no easy answer.  Sometimes it creates an unshakeable bond for life. Alastair Campbell, press secretary to Tony Blair, knows Blair’s faults and his own, but they remain close. Similarly, Andrew Adonis, head of policy in Downing Street under Blair, still regards the former prime minister as a totally exceptional politician, and makes a sometimes lonely case for him to return to frontline British politics. Gavin Barwell, chief of staff to Theresa May, often makes a persuasive case for how she was undone by a parliamentary party that could not compromise over Brexit. Even her two joint chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Cunningham, with whom she dispensed after the 2017 general election debacle, did not turn on her. They would probably admit that pressures led them to become embroiled in furious rows that in retrospect seem trivial. Gordon Brown, flawed as a prime minister and as a consequence sometimes unable to control his temper, still retained the loyalty of the advisers he berated, as the sad photos of his final hours in Downing Street illustrate. They believed in what he was trying to do. Stretching further back, Wilson had his famously loyal kitchen cabinet. Bernard Donoghue, in his memoir the Heat of the Kitchen, revealed the sheer pressure of life in No 10 during the winter of discontent. Thatcher relied heavily on Bernard Ingham, her press secretary, throughout her period in office. He adored her ability to confront “defeatist inertia”, even if he also recognised her as “absolutely tactless”. Lord Powell, her suave private secretary for seven years from 1983, remained a firm admirer of her ability to make waves on the international scene. She returned the compliment once, saying: “Where can I find ministers who are half as good?” Her official biographer, Charles Moore, argued: “The people who worked for her in No 10 almost all liked her very much, and the ministers who worked with her as cabinet ministers usually found her unbearable.” Indeed it was her faith in her Downing Street advisers which was part of her undoing. Her willingness to expose her support for her economics adviser Sir Alan Walters over the exchange rate policy paralysed her government. Lawson resigned on 26 October 1989 and Walters stood down an hour later. David Cameron overall ran a happy ship. He had to dispense with his image guru Steve Hilton once his blue sky thinking came up against the greyer skies of the Whitehall policy machine. But there was no immediate denunciatory resignation letter from Hilton, just a sense that his campaign talents did not transfer to government. The conflict between the two came later. So the endless infighting and high turn-over of staff that has afflicted Boris Johnson’s premiership is an exception. New Labour’s divisions were institutionalised between the Treasury and Downing Street. Some suffered badly such as Brown’s press secretary, Charlie Whelan, was forced to resign by Blair’s team – a loss Brown resented. Others, such as Ed Balls, managed to remake themselves. Johnson by contrast seems to lose advisers at an alarming speed. Some claim it reveals the lack of basic ideology in his thinking. Others suggest it is the casual way in which he uses others to take the blame, refusing to take personal responsibility, which has led to a lack of loyalty. “He blames Carrie to his advisers, and to Carrie he blames his advisers. It is not sustainable”, says one former minister. In the latest cull, the loss of Munira Mirza will hurt and possibly confuse him most. In eight years of working for him, she has seen all his flaws, including his willingness to play fast and loose with the facts. Indeed he is the architect of many of the divisive culture wars. That makes it hard to fathom why she saw Johnson’s personal attack on Keir Starmer as so out of character that it warranted her resignation. Perhaps she simply sensed the prime minister was finished and it was time to detach herself for her own future career. The next few months will tell, but what will be striking is how many advisers, sensing they are on a sinking ship, elect to stay on board with their captain, and leave the rats to it.",News/Politics,Johnson’s high No 10 turnover is a break from past prime ministers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/johnson-no-10-adviser-turnover-past-prime-ministers

2/5/2022,"A farmer who used his forklift tractor to flip and push a Vauxhall Corsa car off his land after a row with the driver over blocking access has been cleared by a jury of dangerous driving and criminal damage after going through “months of hell”. Robert Hooper, 57, a fourth-generation hill farmer, used a telehandler with forks to lift the car from a lane outside his farm in Newbiggin-in-Teesdale, County Durham, flip it and push it on its side on to the road outside, mobile phone footage played to Durham crown court showed.  Hooper argued an “Englishman’s home is his castle”, and claimed he had been punched by Charlie Burns, 21, a passenger in the car, when he first politely asked him and the driver to leave as they were blocking access on what was a busy day on the farm. Burns, who had been visiting the area on that day last June, and had drunk up to seven bottles of lager, was knocked to the ground by the vehicle’s lifting forks, the jury heard. Hooper, who has no previous convictions, claimed the younger man punched him twice in the farm buggy he was driving, splitting his lip. He said he told the driver, Elliott Johnson, and Burns: “If you don’t move it, I will.” Hooper said: “I thought, ‘We have a bit of a problem here, there’s two of them, half my age.’ I didn’t know what they had in terms of weapons, or what they were capable of doing. I thought if the car was off the property, that would be them off the property, out of the way.” He told the court he was aware of an “influx” of youths visiting the area that summer, causing antisocial behaviour. He added: “I felt threatened and an Englishman’s home is his castle, and my castle starts at that front gate.” In his closing speech to the jury, Michael Rawlinson, defending, gave the origin of the saying, referring to comments made by judge Sir Edward Coke, which set legal precedents in 1604. Referring to arguments about how Hooper could have acted differently that day, Rawlinson also quoted the boxer Mike Tyson, saying: “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” In a statement after Hooper’s acquittal, his partner, Kate Henderson, said: “The overwhelming support of the local community and people from afar have kept him going these last eight months of hell.” Burns had been drinking with friends at Low Force waterfall and was intending to walk 52 miles back to South Tyneside when he spotted his friend, Johnson, whose Corsa had suffered a double puncture, which was why they parked in the farmer’s lane, the jury heard. In his closing remarks, David Ward, prosecuting, told the jury the crown was not saying that Hooper was a “thug”, but that his actions were “utterly irrational” that day. Teesdale farmers who were there to support Hooper, welcomed the verdicts after a four-day trial.William Wearmouth told reporters: “He is absolutely first-class. He is a hard-working man, he will help anyone with anything. It’s great to see that the jury has realised this.” John Dickinson said: “It’s a really good result for the local area.

2/5/2022,"On Thursday night, late-night hosts tore into Fox, the network which airs the reality show The Masked Singer, after the former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani was unmasked during a recent taping.  “The guy who’s trying to destroy our country? He’s singing on a show!” mocked Jimmy Kimmel. “How does this even happen?” he wondered. “I mean, a lot of people at Fox had to sign off on this – not one of them was like, ‘Hey maybe we shouldn’t have the guy who’s under investigation for helping to plot an insurrection singing on our show?’” “Why would Rudy even agree to do this? Was he thinking he was going to the Masked Singer Landscaping Company?” Kimmel continued, referencing Giuliani’s infamous appearance at Four Seasons Total Landscaping in November 2020. “Only Rudy Giuliani would try to overthrow the government, break wind loudly in court, sweat hair dye all over one press conference, have another one next to a dildo store, and then try to rehabilitate his image by singing Shake Your Groove Thing dressed as a pineapple,” he added. As for the network that cast Giuliani for the show – “Fox Network really should be ashamed of themselves,” said Kimmel. “They should have another show after The Masked Singer that night called The Masked Executives – all the Fox executives come out in costumes. The one who greenlit this idea takes off the mask and gets voted off television forever.” “No headline has captured the national zeitgeist of existential dread combined with ridicu-stupo-lousiness better than this,” said Stephen Colbert of Giuliani’s Masked Singer appearance. “That’s right – the criminal goon that we know for a fact is being investigated for trying to overthrow our democracy for his idiot emperor was yuckin’ it up on a reality show!” Fox has not revealed what Giuliani sang for his “swan song” or what his costume was, “but it’s safe to assume he was a jackass”, Colbert quipped. A lot of people were upset by the reveal, “but it may not be the producers’ fault”, he joked. “It’s possible that Rudy got drunk and wandered on to the Fox lot and passed out in a costume.” Even people on the show disagreed with the decision to cast Giuliani; upon Giuliani’s reveal, according to Deadline, judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke left the stage in protest. “Or they left in terror,” mused Colbert. “I mean, one of the most chilling phrases in the English language is ‘surprise, it’s Rudy Giuliani!’” Brian Flores sues the NFL for racial discrimination and @roywoodjr has a solution for pointless head coaching interviews. pic.twitter.com/TwDBDT1jiW And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed a new lawsuit against the NFL alleging racial discrimination in its hiring of head coaches. The former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores is suing three teams and the league itself, which he claims “is racially segregated and is managed much like a plantation”. Flores, who is Black, was fired by the Dolphins last month despite leading the team to its first back-to-back winning seasons since 2003. The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, alleges poor treatment by the Dolphins organization and that the New York Giants interviewed him for a head coaching position after it had already decided on a white coach. The superfluous interview would have fulfilled the NFL’s Rooney rule, which requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for head coaching positions. “Which is cool, but now Brian Flores is saying these interviews he’s getting? They’re not real,” said Noah. “These teams are just going through the motions to satisfy the Rooney rule. “Think of it this way: it’s almost like when your mom emails you that her friend from church, her son is moving to your city, and she wants you to be friends with him,” he continued. “And yeah, you go get a beer with him, just to make your mom happy, but you know for a fact you’re never gonna hire him for your friend.” In his lawsuit, Flores highlights a glaring lack of diversity in the NFL’s coaching ranks. More than two-thirds of the league’s players are Black, but there is only one black head coach for 32 teams – two fewer than when the rule was instituted in 2003. “So the Rooney rule is basically as useless as the five-second rule,” said Noah. On top of that, Black coaches in general advance slower and have shorter tenures than white coaches. “Now, is the NFL doing this on purpose to Black coaches? Nobody knows,” Noah mused. “I mean, maybe. Or maybe it’s an unconscious bias. And that’s what makes racism so hard to prove these days. Because back in the day, when someone was being racist to you, you knew. Because they’d be upfront. They’d be like, ‘oh you? You want the head coaching job? You’re one funny Negro!’ “But that’s why proving racism for Black people in 2022 can be so frustrating,” he concluded. “Sometimes it feels like you’re the only person in a horror movie who actually knows what’s going on.”",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Kimmel on Giuliani as the Masked Singer: ‘Fox Network really should be ashamed’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/04/jimmy-kimmel-giuliani-masked-singer-fox-network
2/5/2022,"On 27 September 1955, James Wharram set sail from Falmouth in a 23½ft flat-bottomed double canoe (now called a catamaran) that he had built himself at a cost of £200, with no engine, and none of the electronic navigation equipment today’s sailors take for granted. His quest was to cross the Atlantic, in order to prove that such a vessel, the ancient craft of the Polynesians, was an oceanworthy one. The boat was called Tangaroa, after the Polynesian god of the sea. With Wharram, who has died aged 93, were two German women, Jutta Schultze-Rhonhof and Ruth Merseburger, both of whom he was romantically involved with. “They were very happy to share ‘their man’,” he wrote. “There was no jealousy.”  Wharram’s book about this and subsequent voyages was titled Two Girls, Two Catamarans (1969) and it seemed like the ultimate hippy adventure, before hippies had even been invented. But the trip was far from plain sailing. There were storms in the Bay of Biscay; in Spain Franco’s Guardia Civil thought the travellers were spies; in Gran Canaria they encountered former SS officers escaping to South America; they nearly capsized twice crossing the Atlantic. Wharram and Shultze-Rhonhof were terribly seasick; she found out she was pregnant; and meanwhile Tangaroa’s wooden hulls were being eaten by shipworms. Somehow, after a gruelling five-week crossing, they reached Trinidad. If anything, though, it was more like a beginning than an end. Schultze-Rhonhof gave birth to a son, Hannes. Wharram built a new, bigger catamaran, named Rongo, that they sailed to New York, arriving in 1959. There he found himself alongside Sir Edmund Hillary on a TV quiz show called To Tell the Truth; the audience had to guess which of the three contestants posing as the mountaineer was the real one. Hillary helped Wharram win, and with the prize money he was able to buy a radio for his next voyage, another Atlantic crossing, back to Britain later that year. Wharram was well on his way to a life of seafaring, boat design and boatbuilding. He was born in Manchester, the only child of James, a builder, and his wife, Blanche (nee Cook). As a teenager Wharram enjoyed climbing and roaming the moors. And he read, spending hours in the city’s central library reading about boats, particularly about the ancient Polynesian boats. The Voyage of the Kaimiloa by Éric de Bisschop (1939), about sailing from Hawaii to France, became a lifelong love and inspiration. He also read George Bernard Shaw, HG Wells, Bertrand Russell, William Morris, Adam Smith, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes; he became chairman of a Labour party youth group, but was saved from politics by his wanderlust. Wharram left technical college to travel and work around Europe, where he discovered a new love: for women. Traudl, an Austrian psychologist, introduced him to Freud and Jung. Pat, an American 10 years his senior, gave him a book called Boat Building in Your Own Back Yard. Back in the UK, he worked as a labourer, on a trawler, in a boat yard. Walking in the Lake District, he met Merseburger, who would accompany him on that first transatlantic voyage on Tangaroa with Schultze-Rhonhof, whom he met at a swimming pool. Wharram married Schultze-Rhonhof in 1959, but she had a breakdown, and died falling from a tower in Spain. Five years later, Wharram married Merseburger. They remained together until her death in 2013, joined in the late 60s by Hanneke Boon, who met Wharram when her family, holidaying in Wales, had helped him on another boat-building project. He and Hanneke had a son, Jamie. There were other women coming and going, further catamarans, and further adventurous trips, then a business the three of them ran together from Cornwall, where they settled. Wharram designed catamarans based on Polynesian principles, and they sold the designs. These are not boats for millionaire yachties, but for enthusiasts to make themselves and get to sea cheaply. And Wharram was not your typical yachtsman; it is perhaps not surprising the sailing establishment has sometimes viewed him with some suspicion. He was impossible to ignore, though, and slowly they came round to him. “Who is James Wharram?” asked the yachting writer Tom Cunliffe in Sail magazine in 2007. “Is he a philosopher, or a crackpot? A lifestyle guru or a libertine? Could he be a madman or might he be perhaps, unsettlingly sane? One thing is for sure: he is one of 20th-century seafaring’s most iconic figures.” In 2018 he won a lifetime achievement award from Classic Boat magazine. In his last years Wharram lived with Alzheimer’s disease. “He struggled with his diminished existence,” wrote Boon, whom he married in 2018. “He could not face the prospect of further disintegration and made the very hard call to end it himself.” Wharram took his own life. He is survived by Hanneke, Hannes (now known as Jonathan) and Jamie.

2/5/2022,"From Ozark to Returnal, Euphoria to Uncut Gems, it increasingly feels like modern entertainment exists solely to stress audiences out. While it’s undeniably brilliant that modern television offers viewers less Xena: Warrior Princess and more Succession, if I’m honest, sometimes all I really want from my flickering screen is something calming. Thank God then, for OlliOlli World. Draped in an Adventure Time-esque art style and accompanied by a soundtrack so soothing it would make Anderson .Paak blush, this colourful skater is refreshingly vibey. Packed full of popping pastel colours and littered with a string of self-aware dad jokes, it’s a world away from the grungey skateboarding of the 90s. It’s indicative, really, of where 2022 youth culture is at. Where Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater opted for sweat-inducing trick challenges and blasted punk rock ragers, OlliOlli World leans astutely into the meditative.  In other words, this pixelated playground is a weirdly namaste take on the skateboarder – a virtual trickathon for the yoga bros and bliss-seeking baddies of TikTok. Fittingly then, OlliOlli World isn’t a game about exploration or story but one built around achieving that hypnotic state of “flow”. Combining the automated movement of endless runners such as Temple Run with simple controls and clever checkpointing, it tasks players solely with focusing on the timing of their jumps and nailing tricks. It’s easy to suddenly find yourself lost in a zen-like trance, joyfully hopping and tricking across Radlandia’s fictional locales while enjoying your favourite podcast. It helps that OlliOlli World drip-feeds each new mechanic to the player with the patience of a saint-like primary school teacher. Grabs are pulled off using the right analogue stick, and only properly introduced at the end of the second world – a third of the way through the game. This tactile take on the tutorial is a masterclass in layering game mechanics, waiting until you just begin to feel like a boarding badass before serving up new tricks to master. While there are a lot of things to love about this delightfully vibrant adventure, its characters aren’t among them. As you pelt your way through each course, you find yourself cheered on by a menagerie of mediocre misfits. Churning out skating puns at a wince-inducing rate, sadly OlliOlli World’s wink-wink nudge-nudge dialogue is never quite as witty as it thinks it is. Still, despite the very “how do you do fellow kids” feel, the so-so script does enough to keep the good times rolling along with your avatar. While these cringey cheerleaders will have you hammering the skip button, the intricate stage backgrounds make this fantastical world come alive. Looking like a playable version of a kitschy kawaii fashion blog, this kingdom of eye-popping pinks, giant donuts and hipster animals blends together to create something wonderfully warm and relaxing. Heck, even the way Roll7 approaches challenges and high scores is disarmingly laid-back. Where Hawk’s branded skating sim demands players complete certain objectives in order to proceed, here, simply reaching the end of each pastel playground is enough. Are there additional challenges begging to be bested? Absolutely, but you can tackle those trickier tasks whenever you feel ready, leaving players to ollie and manual across Radlandia at whatever pace they please. In almost every facet of its design, OlliOlli World wants players to feel at home – and that even extends to your customisable, air-grabbing avatar. While the endless slew of unlockable T-shirts, decks and hats eventually lose their charm, I took unusually great pride in making sure that my cartoony creation matched the vision of the hipster skater I dreamed up. As a 30-year-old who started saying the word “rad” ironically and now can’t stop, OlliOlli World feels laser targeted at people like me. From its free-spirited counterculture flavour to its flamboyant aesthetic, this is the gaming equivalent of a weekend trip to Brighton: an interactive experience for those who can’t actually skateboard but religiously buy a new pair of Vans anyway. If you’re feeling understandably worn down by the monotony of the daily grind, OlliOlli World is the charming virtual alternative.  OlliOlli World is released on 8 February, £20.",Arts/Games,OlliOlli World review – vibey skater game offers a meditative ride,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/04/olliolli-world-review-vibey-skater-game-roll7
2/5/2022,"A new side of Charlotte Brontë, showing the author of Jane Eyre’s unexpected penchant for colourful, fashionable, even “sensual” clothing, is revealed in a new exhibition at the Brontë Parsonage Museum. Displaying everything from Charlotte’s bright pink wrapper, which she would have worn around the house, to the extraordinary item known as an “ugly bonnet” which was the height of fashion at the time and which she sported to protect herself from the Yorkshire weather, the exhibition opened this week at the Brontës’ home in Haworth, West Yorkshire.  “My personal favourite is her pink wrapper, which is a really, really strange garment,” said Dr Eleanor Houghton, a historian, writer and illustrator who has co-curated the exhibition. “It was a sort of house coat with a matching cape. It’s hideous, pink, with little flowers on it, very bold, very bright and huge – very voluminous. It’s absolutely the opposite of anything you would ever associate with Charlotte Brontë.” This item of clothing would have been part of Charlotte’s wedding trousseau when she married Arthur Bell Nicholls in 1854. “It’s a sensual garment, it’s something that she would have been seen in in the house, and with Nicholls. So while it’s not exactly a negligee, it’s sort of a Victorian equivalent. It’s an intimate garment,” said Houghton. Dresses of red and orange, and paisley patterned materials, are also shown in the Defying Expectations exhibition – along with the ugly bonnet, a fashion item Charlotte would have bought on a trip to London, and was likely to be the first person in Haworth to own. “It’s a really fascinating item: it was a sort of hands-free parasol,” said Houghton. “It was worn around the front of the bonnet rim to help protect the wearer’s face from the sun. It pulls down, a bit like a pram hood. I have to say I can’t imagine it catching on again, but it’s great seeing her within the context of these slightly mad innovations – we just don’t associate Charlotte with that at all.” The exhibition also features a striped evening dress, which was found hidden away during previous renovations of the Brontë Parsonage Museum and which Houghton’s research has confirmed for the first time as being owned by Charlotte. And it includes a pair of beaded moccasins believed to have been a gift from her publishers in New York. “Those moccasins may well have influenced her writing of Shirley – there’s lots of references to Mohawks, and that is exactly where her moccasins come from,” said Houghton. The academic has also done experiments on the fabric of the striped dress, working with the University of Southampton to discover that it is partly made from alpaca fibres – a cutting-edge material at the time, likely to have been manufactured nearby. “All these things really connect her to the place in which she was living but also to this much more globalised world. It helps to release her from the myth that she was holed up in Haworth separate from everyone else, because it’s simply not true. There were many more forces at play, and I think that it shows a much more vital and relevant person,” said Houghton. “The items that have been placed on display wonderfully and tangibly demonstrate that the prevailing preconception that Brontë remained entirely unaffected by the fast-changing world of which she was part is untrue. Moreover, these garments prove that Charlotte and her most famous protagonist were not, in sartorial terms at least, interchangeable.” The exhibition is the first time Brontë has been “celebrated through her clothes”, said the museum, which will run the display of more than 20 pieces of her clothing and accessories until 1 January 2023. “When I first started working here, we couldn’t display some of the items included in this exhibition as people simply wouldn’t have believed that they belonged to the family – they were so outlandish,” said principal curator Ann Dinsdale. “Seeing the personal items these young women wore brings out an emotional response from audiences; it reminds us that these globally significant writers were also human. I think this exhibition, showing Charlotte’s sense of style and her interest in contemporary patterns and materials, will surprise visitors.” The author was around 4ft 10in, and the museum said visitors were always surprised by her size.",Arts/Books,New exhibition of clothing reveals Charlotte Brontë’s sensual side,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/charlotte-bronte-clothing-exhibition-sensual-side-parsonage-museum
2/5/2022,"In the lead-up to Thursday night’s Afcon semi-final between Cameroon and Egypt, a minor exchange of views broke out between Samuel Eto’o and Carlos Queiroz. Eto’o, formerly Cameroon’s star striker and now president of their federation, referred to the upcoming match as a “war”, causing Egypt coach Queiroz to respond philosophically. “Football is not about war,” he insisted. “Football is about celebration, it’s about joy, it’s about happiness.” And so the moment those words left his lips, it instantly became inevitable that Queiroz would spend the duration of the game on a rolling boil, a bain-marie of belligerence whose bellicosity would make Vladimir Putin sound like a member of the Beatles in 1967.  Queiroz was on one from the get-go, theatrically falling to his knees on the touchline after a full 12 minutes of action, in protest at the award of a garden-variety free-kick in midfield. Referee Bakary Gassama came across to give him the what-for, but not a word of the lecture sunk in, and the Egypt coach kept at it for the next 75 minutes, missing not a beat until he was yellow-carded for flapping his neck once too often. Then, a full three minutes after that, Gassama showed him a red for demanding action over some minor squabble or other. Cue jets of steam from the Queirozian lugs, and a chest-out march towards the official that for a split second looked like the precursor to the throwing of hands. Come along now, Carlos, remember your special words: celebration, joy, happiness. Fortunately for Queiroz, he was pulled away mid-fume by his assistant Wael Gomaa and dispatched down the tunnel, where the words eff and jeff could be heard pinging off the walls. Gomaa was later shown a yellow card himself, his second of the tournament, which means both Egypt coaches will miss the final, a match their players will contest alone on Sunday thanks to Cameroon not bothering to practise penalties. Queiroz had barely calmed down by the time of his post-match presser, in which he accused Gassama of “wanting to put on a show” and coming into Egypt’s dressing room before the game “to intimidate our staff”. Egypt also furiously called on the CAF to push the final back to Monday, on account of their being a bit knackered, and Senegal having one extra day to prepare. In effect, it was a declaration of war on officialdom, made when they should have been joyfully celebrating a happy result. Oh Carlos! Remember your special words!
