3/5/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin couldn't hold back when following a retired U.S. Army colonel on the air recently, saying she barely had time to correct all of his “distortions.” She tried, though. And it wasn’t for the first time or the last time. Griffin, who has reported for Fox News Channel since 1996, has attracted attention over the past two weeks as she has publicly corrected or contradicted several Fox analysts and hosts on the air about the crisis in Ukraine. When Tucker Carlson suggested this week that some reporters are acting as flacks for the Pentagon, some interpreted that as a criticism of his colleague. Meanwhile, former Fox host Bill O'Reilly singled Griffin out as a gutsy reporter unafraid to challenge others. Griffin says her efforts are consistent with what she's always tried to do for 25 years, both on the air and behind the scenes at Fox News. “I think you want your experts, in today's media environment, to be passionate about what they know and what they feel about the facts,” said Steve Krakauer, author of The Fourth Watch, a media newsletter with a conservative viewpoint. “I want them to be in the story.” Griffin knows her beat as much as anyone in journalism and her real-time fact-checks are a valuable public service, as long as she doesn’t get caught in the muck of partisan debating, he said on Thursday. Griffin has pushed back on comments made by Sean Hannity, Steve Doocy, Harris Faulkner and Greg Gutfeld during appearances on their own shows. After Hannity criticized President Joe Biden on Ukraine policy, Griffin noted that every president since the fall of the Soviet Union has made mistakes there. Doocy argued on “Fox & Friends” that sanctions haven’t worked against Russia; Griffin said it was too soon to say that. When Faulkner similarly questioned whether sanctions were a sufficient step, Griffin said that sending troops to the area would have given Putin an excuse to invade. She said it was “not some wag-the-dog situation” when Gutfeld suggested on “The Five” that the Ukraine crisis had been manufactured. This past Sunday, she took on a retired U.S. Army brigadier general, Don Bolduc, after he said that it “boggles my mind” that the United States hadn’t already gone “all in” on Ukraine. Griffin said Bolduc was a politician, not a student of history. “To suggest that the U.S. would put indirect fire or special operations or CIA on the ground to give Putin any sort of excuse to broaden this conflict is extremely dangerous talk at a time like this,” Griffin said. Earlier that day, she was interviewed by Trey Gowdy after an appearance by retired U.S. Army Col. Doug Macgregor, who urged the United States to stay out of Ukraine and not ship it any weapons. He said the Russians should be allowed to annex the portion of Ukraine they are most interested in. When Griffin followed him, she said she needed to correct some of what Macgregor had said, “and I'm not sure 10 minutes is enough time because there are so many distortions.” She said that Macgregor sounded like an apologist for Putin. ""That kind of projection of withdrawal and weakness is what made Putin think he could move into a sovereign country,” she said. Macgregor, in a subsequent radio appearance, criticized Griffin for offering a “standard neo-con narrative” of drawing comparison to 1930s appeasement of Adolf Hitler. He called it a “tired trope"" that had nothing to do with the people and events of today. Two days after his appearance on Gowdy's show, Macgregor was brought on as lead guest by Tucker Carlson in prime time. Carlson's show is usually the most-watched program on Fox. “Unlike so many of the so-called reporters you see on television, he is not acting secretly as a flack for (Defense Secretary) Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon,” Carlson said in his introduction. “No, Doug Macgregor is an honest man.” Was that a shot at Griffin? Carlson did not specify what reporters he was referring to, and Fox News did not offer a clarification. He hasn't been afraid to take on colleagues in the past; Carlson and Shepard Smith had a memorable tiff before Smith left the network in 2019. Griffin also didn't respond to a message seeking comment. Griffin, who is based at the Pentagon and had stints in Moscow and Jerusalem for Fox, has a reputation for being knowledgeable and a straight-shooter, said David Lapan, a former Pentagon spokesman who dealt with her professionally in several national security capacities. Much of her work reporting for her employer is done behind the scenes, Lapan said. He believes her recent on-the-air correctives indicate how important she considers the issues involved. “I hope there are no reprisals because she's doing the right thing,” Lapan said. “The stakes are too high.” Fox News Media, in a statement, said that “we are incredibly proud of Jennifer Griffin and her stellar reporting as well as all of our journalists and talent covering this story across our platforms.” O'Reilly, on his web show, praised Griffin and said that “propagandists” on television news aren't challenged often enough, according to the Wrap. Fox would not make Griffin available for an interview. She appeared on Fox's “Media Buzz” on Sunday, where she told host Howard Kurtz that she doesn’t believe her role at Fox News has changed. “I’m here to fact-check facts, because I report on facts,” she said. “My job is to try and figure out the truth as best as I know it. I share that information internally, so out network can be more accurate. That’s what I’ve always done.”",U.S./Associated Press,Fox News defense reporter challenges war comments on air,https://news.yahoo.com/fox-news-defense-reporter-challenges-180209924.html
3/5/2022,"A former Salt Bae employee told Mail Online the London restaurant is ""immoral."" Nusr-Et, which opened in London in September, quickly gained widespread attention for its prices. Guillermo Perez said he saw the restaurant, which charges up to $850 for steak, using frozen fries. A man who says he's a former employee of Salt Bae's London restaurant has called it ""McDonald's for rich people"" for serving frozen fries, according to a Mail Online article published on Thursday. Guillermo Perez, who told Mail Online's Laurence Dollimore he worked as a sommelier at Nusr-Et in Knightsbridge until he was fired in January, said the restaurant is ""immoral"" because of its price markups. He said it charges £3,000, or around $4,000, for bottles of wine worth £1,000, or $1,400. Nusret Gökçe, more commonly known as Salt Bae, who first took social media by storm in 2017, opened the Nusr-Et location in Knightsbridge, London, last September to immediate widespread attention for its high prices. Charging $850 for a steak and $15 for a can of Red Bull, some users on Twitter branded the restaurant's prices ""extortionate,"" Insider previously reported. ""One day I saw a big bag of frozen chips and I thought 'really? That's what we are serving people?' And they had Heinz ketchup and mayonnaise, which you can get from the shop,"" Perez told Mail Online. Representatives for the restaurant Nusr-Et and Gökçe did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Perez, who told Mail Online he's 30 years old and originally from Madrid, said he's worked as a sommelier for eight years, and claims to have been fired from the company for eating avocado and rice during a shift. According to Perez, workers were not allowed to eat from the staff canteen past 5:30 p.m., and although he explained that the food he brought with him was his own, he said he was told to meet HR 30 minutes later. During the meeting, Perez said he was told not to return to work the next day. He said he pressed HR for justification for being fired and was told he was not selling enough wine, according to Mail Online. Perez added that he'll soon be starting a new job as a sommelier on a luxury cruise liner. Despite the criticism, the restaurant chain has still proved popular with celebrities. Figures including David Beckham and Jason Statham have posted Instagram photos alongside Gökçe at his restaurants. Perez did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

3/5/2022,"One tanker was scheduled to dock at the Isle of Grain in southeast England on Friday, The Guardian reported. Workers at the LNG terminal had warned in advance they wouldn't process Russian natural gas. Dockers are ""determined to show their support for the Ukrainian people,"" a union official said. British dockworkers have prevented two tankers carrying Russian natural gas from offloading their cargo in the UK in a protest again Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to reports. Dockworkers at the Isle of Grain liquefied natural gas terminal in southeast England had insisted that they would not unload cargoes from Russia, The Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday. On Thursday, the paper reported that the LNG tanker Boris Vilkitsky – which was scheduled to tie up at the terminal on Friday – had been diverted. A second vessel, the Fedor Litke, has also been diverted, the BBC reported. Both vessels are sailing under the Cyprus flag, it said. Speaking ahead of the ships' diversions, Matt Lay, the national officer for energy at the union representing the Isle of Grain workers, Unison, said: ""The workers at the National Grid terminal don't want to touch the cargo given the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine."" ""These staff are determined to show their support for the Ukrainian people and uphold the sanctions imposed against Russia,"" he added. The UK government on March 1 banned vessels with any Russian connection from docking in the UK, as part of a package of responses to Moscow's decision to send troops into Ukraine. A Department of Transport spokesperson told Insider on Friday that the ban applies to vessels that are owned, operated or managed by Russian entities. Cargoes from Russia could be processed if they arrive on vessels from other nations, the spokesperson added. The Isle of Grain terminal, operated by National Grid, is the largest LNG import facility in Europe and can accommodate 20% of the UK's LNG delivery capacity. A spokesperson for National Grid, which operates the Isle of Grain terminal told the BBC: ""In line with government policy, we do not expect any Russian-linked ships to dock at Grain."" The company did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. According to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, the UK could spend £6.3 million per day on Russian natural gas this year, generating funds that it warned could be used to fund Russia's invasion in Ukraine, according to a press release on its website.  ""Although not at the same level of some other European countries, the UK has been spending billions of pounds on Russian gas that could now be used to fund Putin's war in Ukraine,"" Simon Cran-McGreehin, the ECIU's head analyst said.

3/5/2022,"By Emma Farge GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States warned Russia and Belarus at a U.N. arms control meeting on Thursday not to deploy nuclear arms in Moscow's neighbouring ally following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Any movement of Russian nuclear weapons into Belarus would be dangerously provocative and further destabilize the region. We call on Belarus to reject Russia's policies of nuclear threat and intimidation,"" U.S. envoy Aud-Frances McKernan told the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in remarks provided by the U.S. mission. Her comments come as the Geneva-based CD debated Russia's invasion after Kyiv accused Moscow at the forum of ""violating all key disarmament treaties"". A referendum in Belarus on Sunday approved a new constitution ditching the country's non-nuclear status at a time when the former Soviet republic has become a launch pad for Russia's military operation, Russian news agencies said. The new constitution could see nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had said this week that Russian shelling during its offensive amounted to war crimes. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the CD meeting earlier this week that Kyiv had been seeking to acquire nuclear arms, saying Moscow needed to prevent that. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi told reporters in Vienna on Wednesday that the U.N. nuclear watchdog had no evidence to support Lavrov's allegation. ""For us it is very clear. We do not have any information that would question the non-proliferation credentials of Ukraine,"" Grossi said when asked about Lavrov's comment. ""It's important to say...that we continue our (nuclear) safeguards operation and we don't have information that there's any deviation of material, any undeclared material or activities leading to the development of nuclear weapons."" Some delegates saw the Ukraine crisis as an opportunity to revitalise the Conference on Disarmament, which has an ambitious formal mandate to negotiate weapons cuts but has not struck a deal since the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. However, experts said there was little hope of a concrete outcome on the allegations of Ukraine and other members against Russia since the 65-member forum must decide by consensus.
