12/23/2021,"Energy firms that took on millions of customers from rivals that collapsed amid soaring gas prices have been granted an initial £1.83bn compensation by the regulator to help them absorb extra costs. The sum, which relates to the wave of failures among household energy suppliers during 2021, is likely to rise and will ultimately be funded by anyone who pays gas and electricity bills.  Since August, 25 suppliers have fallen victim to surging prices, which left them paying far more for gas but selling it for far less because of an energy price cap that was intended to protect bill payers. The regulator, Ofgem, arranged for healthy competitors to take on the collapsed firms’ customers via its “supplier of last resort” scheme, which prevents disruption to household supply. But agreeing to serve so many extra customers meant the suppliers of last resort had to buy more energy on wholesale markets. They can charge that cost, £1.83bn according to Ofgem disclosures, to local gas and electricity distribution networks from April. Those grid operators, in turn, will add the extra cost to what they charge suppliers for use of their systems. That means the money will eventually be added to household bills, which are already expected to soar next year to reflect the wide gas price surge. The £1.83bn approved by Ofgem covers buying energy on the wholesale markets but does not include other expenses such as staff and IT, which are yet to be calculated and will be added to the total later. The final bill related to energy supplier collapses could rise to £2.5bn, according to some estimates. The largest single compensation payment of £681m went to Octopus Energy for taking on Avro Energy’s 580,000 customers, while British Gas was granted £361m for taking on half a million customers from several smaller firms. Shell Energy was awarded £362m. “Ofgem’s safety net has protected more than 4 million customers through the unprecedented global gas prices this year, making sure they have an energy supplier and household credit balances are honoured,” a spokesperson for the regulator said. “This comes at a cost, which we always seek to minimise. As we announced last week, we’re also stabilising the retail market with robust stress tests for all suppliers.” The largest energy supplier to fail in 2021 was Bulb Energy, with 1.6 million customers. However, the size of the company meant its collapse activated a separate “special administration” scheme. Under this arrangement, Bulb is being run by the global advisory firm Teneo, with Treasury funds of £1.7bn set aside to fund it. This cost could also end up being added to household energy bills.",News/Business,Ofgem gives £1.83bn to energy firms that took on collapsed rivals’ customers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/ofgem-gives-183bn-to-energy-firms-that-took-on-collapsed-rivals-customers
12/23/2021,"Since her appointment as foreign secretary in September, Liz Truss has said little about the European Union. Her speeches exalt the UK as the broker of a global “network of liberty”, listing alliances with scarcely any reference to the club of democracies on Britain’s continental doorstep. That omission partly reflects the ideological temper of the Conservative party, to which Ms Truss is highly sensitised. It also expressed divisions of labour in the cabinet when David Frost was in charge of post-Brexit negotiations with Brussels. But since Lord Frost’s resignation, the European portfolio has returned to the Foreign Office. Silence on the subject is no longer an option for the secretary of state. Her first intervention has been to restate Britain’s readiness to trigger article 16 of the withdrawal agreement, suspending its operation, if grievances regarding the Northern Ireland protocol are not satisfied. The terms demanded by Lord Frost for a renegotiation still stand.  The pugnacious tone disappointed those who had hoped that a change in personnel indicated a new willingness to compromise. That prospect is not entirely lost. Ms Truss had to signal continuity in the negotiating position. Anything else would have caused a commotion on the Tory benches and destabilised an already wobbly government. That does not rule out a pragmatic shift in the coming months. The foreign secretary will not want Brexit to consume all of her political bandwidth, and the most efficient way to avoid that is to take her finger off the article 16 trigger. There are two obstacles. One is Ms Truss’s ambition, scarcely veiled, to succeed Boris Johnson in Downing Street. That will involve pandering to Europhobic sentiment among Tory grassroots and backbench MPs, at the expense of sound diplomacy. The second is the disparate way that Brexit scatters its consequences across Whitehall, beyond the institutional reach of the Foreign Office. At the strategic level, that is the correct base for the development of European relations, but Mr Johnson’s Brexit was drafted in defiance of strategic thinking. He has explicitly ruled Britain out of institutionalised foreign policy cooperation with Brussels. Disentangling Britain from EU membership has huge ongoing consequences for border management, economic policy, trade, relations between Westminster government and the devolved administrations. There are problems yet to be resolved around the replacement of lost EU subsidies for agriculture and poorer regions. Fisheries will be a constant headache. Lord Frost’s portfolio also included questions of regulatory reform, exploring supposed benefits of Brexit by scrubbing the residue of Brussels form the statute book. Taken in the round, few cabinet ministers are unaffected, and it is unclear whether Ms Truss has the capacity or the will to coordinate the process. Much of the day-to-day engagement with Brussels will fall to her ministerial deputy, Chris Heaton-Harris, a hardliner who formerly chaired the perennially dissatisfied European Research Group of MPs. Even with an application of pragmatic will, the structural impediments to a more sensible European policy are great. The underlying reason is the longstanding failure in government to understand or even engage with the full implications of leaving the EU on the terms that Mr Johnson negotiated. Until that is fixed, the relationship will be unbalanced and uneasy. And fixing it is more a question of regime change than cabinet reshuffle.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on Liz Truss and Brexit: new chapter, same story | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/22/the-guardian-view-on-liz-truss-and-brexit-new-chapter-same-story
12/23/2021,"The busy streets of central London are normally no place for the faint-hearted in the run to Christmas. Aggressive shoppers jostle with increasing urgency to secure last-minute gifts while revellers spill out from bars and restaurants to celebrate their final days in the office. But this is far from a normal Christmas. Shoppers and tourists have stayed away from the capital in large numbers, new figures - and haunting pictures - reveal.  Images of near-empty streets in major citiessuch as Manchester and Edinburgh tell a tale of shoppers and tourists alike staying away from city centres over fears about the spread of the Omicron variant and a mass return to working from home. Andrew Lloyd Webber has closed Cinderella until next year, and productions of Hamilton and The Lion King have been pulled. Data from the retail intelligence firm Springboard on Wednesday showed a 17.3% drop in footfall in central London compared with the same day last week, and regional cities have recorded a 3.4% drop. A central London “back-to-office benchmark”, which measures only areas in close proximity to offices, shows footfall down 21.8%. “In a week where you would have normally expected more people, figures are going down,” said Springboard’s insight director, Diane Wehrle. “People are heeding plan B and staying away from the office. Restaurants are closing early. London isn’t deserted exactly, but it is certainly a lot quieter than usual.” Things are likely to be worse for hospitality businesses than for shops, she said. Shops potentially experience a higher “conversion rate” with people ready to spend money saved during lockdowns rather than just browse. “This could definitely make it even worse for cafes and pubs, as visitors who were intending to go into high streets to eat and drink may well choose to do that elsewhere.” Footfall in London’s West End was down 27% on pre-pandemic levels on Tuesday, sparking further criticism that the chancellor is not doing enough to help hospitality. Rishi Sunak announced a £1bn bailout package on Tuesday consisting of business grants and help with sick pay, but he ruled out bringing back furlough for the hardest hit firms. Michael Kill, the head of the Night Time Industry Association, said the sector was facing its biggest challenge since the start of the pandemic but not getting the help it desperately needed. “We’re being marshalled by a government which has no real understanding of proportionate support or the real cost implications, or even the sensitivities around the vital part the festive period plays in the survival of our sector,” he said. Pictures of closed restaurants and quiet shops in large city centres are, however, only part of the story. Local high streets have not been hit as hard. Springboard data shows that footfall is up 0.1% in UK market towns, and outdoor retail parks with high street stores recorded a rise of 22.6% on the same day last week. “There are parts of central London that feel like a ghost town,” said Patrick O’Brien, the UK research director at GlobalData Retail. “Closer to home it’s a different picture, but that is only relative to the worse picture in city centres. While for many retailers this might be a better Christmas than last year, it’s not a useful comparison. This will still be a very difficult Christmas for many.” Darker clouds were likely to be on the horizon for shops, he said: “The truth is, the longer restrictions - either voluntary or imposed - last, the more ingrained consumer behaviour such as the move online becomes.” In Hertford, a market town where many workers normally commute to London, a lot of people have been staying closer to home and supporting local businesses, said Muslum Kurnaz, the manager of Hertford Organic. “Business is really picking up this week. I think a lot of people don’t want to go into big supermarkets,” he said. “Lots of people work in London here, but I think they want to support local businesses this year. Chocolate sales have really gone up.” Will Walton and his wife Yellie, who own Love Flowers and The Shop in the town, said more customers from outer London suburbs had decided to drive north rather than take the tube into town. He also feels shoppers are ready to spend money despite an increase in the wholesale cost of flowers. A recent Christmas flower order from a premier league footballer – he won’t say which one - resulted in a £3,500 sale. “We’ve met our targets for Christmas this year, so we’re just really happy about that,” he said. “Our regulars are really fantastic and we’re just trying to make sure they get everything they need. We can only do our best.” If there is a silver lining for retailers from the coronavirus pandemic, it is to be found on smaller high streets and out-of-town retail parks, said Springboard’s Wehrle. “I hesitate to say there is an upside, but if there is upside, it is that it might actually have saved some high streets who were facing really challenging times.” ",News/World news,‘Like a ghost town’: customers desert city centres as Omicron takes hold,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/like-a-ghost-town-customers-desert-city-centres-as-omicron-takes-hold
12/23/2021,"They have become an integral part of millions of people’s lives: lateral flow tests (LFTs) are taken daily by some for work or socialising, while new guidance means that anyone with Covid will be allowed to finish their isolation period after seven days rather than 10 if they have two negative results. Here’s all you need to know about the rapid tests, from what experts have to say on their reliability to why you may repeatedly test positive many days after an initial Covid infection.  LFTs identify specific viral proteins that are present inside your nose when coronavirus is infecting you. If you have come into contact with an infected person, it could take a few days for a negative result to show up. “Please continue to test on a daily basis,” urges Irene Petersen, professor of epidemiology and health informatics at University College London. The reliability of LFTs depends in part on whether you follow the instructions carefully, which is why studies give varying estimates of their efficacy, from 40% to 90%. A recent paper demonstrated that LFTs, when used correctly, are likely to have a sensitivity above 80% and in many cases above 90%. After carrying out tests, the UK Health Security Agency said LFTs have a “comparable sensitivity” for Omicron as for other Covid variants such as Delta. The main benefit of LFTs is they can be carried out quickly and easily at home, with a result in under 30 minutes, and that they don’t need to be sent to a lab. However, the gold standard remains the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which detects viral load and infectiousness at lower levels, including before and after the time range in which they are picked up by LFTs. You could become infectious after you take the test, which is why scientists recommend taking it as close to your social plans as possible, ideally within an hour. “Omicron replicates very fast, so you may become very infectious within hours,” says Petersen. If you took one early in the morning and are going out in the evening, you might take another, provided there has been a gap of six to 12 hours. However, it’s worth bearing in mind that there is a test shortage at the moment, and they are urgently required for key workers, so use them strategically. Petersen emphasises that “no test offers 100% accuracy, so please consider the risk of getting severe illness among your friends and family”. Double lines appearing on an LFT – however faint – mean you have detectable virus in your nose and are therefore infectious. Azeem Majid, a professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, notes that the test is “not designed to estimate how infectious you may be”. However, David Matthews, a professor of virology at the University of Bristol, says that a thicker line could mean – in theory at least – there is more N protein. “That should mean more virus and therefore more infectivity in principle, but no one has tested that idea,” he says. NHS rules state that your isolation begins on the day that your symptoms develop or the day that you receive a positive result if you don’t have symptoms, and ends 10 days later. You can cut this isolation period down to seven days if you receive negative LFTs on days six and seven, 24 hours apart. The new guidance applies to everyone, regardless of vaccination status. Majid says there is no need to keep on testing repeatedly if you have had a positive LFT result confirmed by a PCR test. “Test results can sometimes remain positive for a period after your isolation ends, but this does not necessarily mean you are still infectious.” Petersen agrees that people are “unlikely” to remain infectious, though it is not impossible. It’s more likely that “there are some LFTs which seem to be able to detect a very small amount of viral protein for a long time”, she says. Matthews suggests getting a PCR test and potentially seeking additional medical advice if you are still testing positive, as it could mean you have an underlying medical condition. This original guidance reflects the low rate of reinfection during this window, meaning false positives could force people to unnecessarily self-isolate. However, complete data is not yet available for Omicron reinfection rates, so it could change. Matthews says the new guidance does not negate the earlier advice. Instead, “What they are saying now is that if you are LFT-negative on two days then you are very likely no longer contagious and can go to work”. Petersen says there are two probable reasons for this. First, it’s likely that vaccinated people or those with immunity from prior infection have symptoms even before they become infectious, as these are immune responses. Second, it is possible – though uncertain – that transmission with Omicron occurs at lower viral loads. “If the latter is the case, it is important that people start to isolate as soon as they have any symptoms that suggest they may have Covid, even if the LFT is negative,” she says. Reinfections can occur after a previous Covid-19 infection. This is especially common with Omicron, which according to a recent Imperial College London report is more than five times more likely to cause reinfection than the Delta variant. These reinfections are most likely to have been in those who were previously infected with an earlier variant, such as Delta or Alpha. This means you should continue to be careful, but it isn’t cause for excessive concern. Matthews says that any reinfection will “probably be a mild cold” as you will have built up “a bigger and better army of ‘memory’ T and B cells”, as long as you are otherwise healthy.",News/World news,How reliable are lateral flow tests for Omicron and what are the latest rules?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/lateral-flow-tests-covid-omicron-explainer
12/23/2021,"The Boxing Day Test is a chance for England’s batters to show whether instructions about discipline outside off stump have permeated following a forthright team meeting that saw them forced to rewatch their dismissals during the 275-run defeat in Adelaide. After going 2-0 down in the Ashes series Joe Root used his post-match press conference to criticise the lengths bowled by his seam attack. However the Guardian understands it was the batting unit that drew much of the ire during a post-match debrief in which the usually mild-mannered head coach, Chris Silverwood, was angered.  In scenes that sound mildly reminiscent of Australia’s response to their shock defeat at Headingley during the 2019 Ashes series – when Justin Langer replayed in full the entire fourth day meltdown suffered at the hands of Ben Stokes – Silverwood put 14 of the 20 English wickets to fall on the TV screen in the dressing room and highlighted failures to leave balls in the channel that didn’t need playing at. Stokes, the vice-captain, is said to have been a strong voice during these intense discussions, while Jos Buttler, who followed a first-innings edge to slip for a duck with a 207-ball rearguard on the final day, also spoke up to correct one individual who suggested the focus should be on the first 20 balls each batter faces in Australia. Buttler instead stressed the need for this discipline to be the focus throughout, citing the example of Marnus Labuschagne, who on Wednesday displaced Root at the top of the ICC Test batting rankings, after a first innings 103 from 305 balls that saw 83 deliveries left alone. Overall Australia’s batters left around a third of the deliveries they faced against the new ball – ie the first 30 overs – while for England this figure dropped to a quarter, despite both attacks operating similar lines and lengths. The frank nature of this all-in debrief is understood to have surprised a number of players present. But the response is said to have been positive, with England’s faltering top seven accepting a need to address a collective urge to feel bat on ball after eight of their 14 wickets fell to catches between wicketkeeper and gully off the seamers. Mark Wood, the fast bowler who was rested in Adelaide despite impressing at the Gabba, said: “We obviously review the game, things we could do better, things we’ve done well. But this was more a kick up the bum to say look we are 2-0 down now, the same mistakes keep on happening. It was a good discussion. “It could go one of two ways, but people having those brutally honest conversations and accepting that within the group is something I feel like the team are open to and respect – the fact we can speak to each other like that. I think we probably needed it.” Root’s public appraisal of the bowlers dropping too short, though not supported by the Hawk-Eye data and a source of criticism from former Australia captain Ricky Ponting regarding leadership, risked creating a rift given the second Test was ultimately lost during a collapse of eight for 86 in 38.3 overs on the third day. But Wood, set to return for the must-win third Test at the MCG, said: “If I’m brutally honest, it doesn’t feel in the dressing room that it’s a batters v bowlers thing, with all the batters in one corner giving snidey talk about the bowlers and all the bowlers in the other corner talking about the batters. It’s not like that. “I think as a bowling group we can always get better as well and that’s something we’re constantly reviewing and looking at. With the batting, as we discussed in the meeting, these heavy collapses that we keep having are what are costing us Test matches. “If you have a bad session or you lose a couple of wickets, that’s not ideal but fair enough. If we’re losing huge chunks of the game [to collapses], then that’s what is knocking us back. We’re all in it together. But we’re coming under a bit of fire at the minute for batting and bowling because we are getting soundly beaten.” Wood’s absence from the second Test represented a contentious decision from the England team management at 1-0 down, the 31-year-old having sent down 25 overs of searing pace at the Gabba and hurried up Steve Smith before his dismissal for only 12. Asked if he accepted the call, Wood replied: “I was ready to go if required, but the decision was made that I would be left out. I accept that. We’re all part of a team here that’s trying to win the Ashes. If that was the best decision for the team, that was fine.” On the prospect of a return in front of a projected crowd of 70,000 at the MCG, Wood added: “It’s a huge occasion. If I get selected, that’s something I can tell my son one day that I got up in front of that many people in a massive sporting occasion with everything on the line. I’ll give everything I’ve got, 100%, charging in, to try to get us the right result to get us back in the Ashes.”",Sport/Sport,England batters are forced to rewatch wickets in heated Ashes meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/22/england-batsmen-forced-to-rewatch-wickets-in-post-adelaide-ashes-debrief
12/23/2021,"The US has eased its restrictions on mainstream humanitarian aid reaching famine-stricken Afghanistan and backed a UN security council resolution exempting most aid from the threat of sanctions. The US Treasury followed up the UN resolution by broadening the definition of permitted humanitarian assistance to include education – including salary payments to teachers – and to permit a broader use of US funds received by aid organisations working inside Afghanistan.  The US has been trying to use aid as a lever to force the Taliban, who seized power in August, not to suppress women’s rights, including access to education. But aid groups said that in seeking to pressurise the Taliban, the US was at risk of driving ordinary Afghans towards starvation. Aid agencies have for months complained the continued unqualified US sanctions on Taliban leaders and entities meant it was impossible to provide aid into Taliban-run Afghanistan through normal banking channels, but the US-backed UN resolution clarified that aid to relieve humanitarian needs would not need to be treated as money directed to the Taliban. The resolution’s careful wording has been the subject of lengthy negotiations in New York, and was in part resolved by an agreement that the mechanism will be reviewed after a year, and include tight reporting requirements. The resolution states humanitarian assistance and other activities that support basic human needs in Afghanistan are not in violation of sanctions but aid agencies are strongly advised to use reasonable efforts to minimise any benefits accruing to the sanctioned entities. It remains to be seen how the US Treasury will police the less stringent regime and how quickly money in the World Bank and UN trust fund set aside for Afghanistan can be released. The US is unlikely to release up to $9bn (£6.7bn) in frozen Afghan assets since this would be taken by the Taliban. Efforts by countries such as Qatar to persuade the Taliban to relax the ban on women working and girls going to school have been largely fruitless. Martin Griffiths, the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, welcomed the resolution, saying: “This milestone decision will enable urgently needed humanitarian action to save lives and livelihoods in Afghanistan. It is evidence of how seriously member states take the shocking levels of need and suffering in the country. “This humanitarian exception will allow organisations to implement the work we have planned, and it will give legal assurances to the financial institutions and commercial actors we rely on to engage with humanitarian operators. The road ahead in Afghanistan is neither easy nor straightforward.” In welcoming the resolution, the US highlighted the regular reporting requirements by the UN and the need for aid agencies to show due diligence that aid was not being diverted to those subject to sanctions. But the US also gave a broad definition of permitted aid including “shelter and settlement assistance, food security, education, livelihoods support, energy, water, sanitation, health including Covid-19-related assistance, nutrition, and hygiene”. Britain’s UN envoy, Barbara Woodward, said: “This resolution will help save lives, by ensuring that the 1988 sanctions regime (pdf) poses no obstacle to the provision of humanitarian assistance and other activities that support basic human needs in Afghanistan. This directly responds to what the humanitarian community told us they needed”. David Miliband, the president of the International Rescue Committee, said: “The humanitarian exception to sanctions on the Taliban is a critical step that will support humanitarian actors like the IRC to scale up and deliver lifesaving services to Afghans in need without fearing legal repercussions. This couldn’t come soon enough as 9 million people in Afghanistan are marching toward famine and Afghan families are bracing for an extremely tough winter.” He added: “The suspension of foreign development aid flows to Afghanistan– which previously propped up 75% of all government spending – has wiped out the government’s ability to pay public servants and deliver desperately needed public services, including basic healthcare, to millions of Afghans.",News/World news,US eases restrictions on sending aid to famine-hit Afghanistan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/us-eases-restrictions-sending-aid-famine-hit-afghanistan

12/23/2021,"Greek authorities have said dozens of refugees are believed dead after a boat carrying as many as 50 people, according to one witness, sank off the island of Folegandros, in the second major loss of life in the Mediterranean within days of people desperately trying to reach Europe. Almost 24 hours after the rescue operation was launched late Tuesday, coastguard officials said it was unlikely that survivors from the shipwreck would be found.  “Efforts will continue but in waters that are very cold and very deep the chances of finding anyone [alive] are decreasing by the hour,” said Nikos Kokkalas, the Hellenic coastguard’s spokesperson. “Our fear is that most simply didn’t manage to get off the boat and would have sunk with it to the bottom of the ocean.” By late Wednesday rescuers had found the body of only one man, he said. The incident comes less than five days after UN migration officials announced that 164 people had drowned off the coast of Libya, now the dominant transit point for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Attempted crossings from the anarchic oil-rich country have surged in recent months amid an unprecedented crackdown on refugees in Tripoli, its capital. In two separate shipwrecks on Friday and Saturday rescuers retrieved the corpses of those who had drowned when wooden boats heading from Libya to Italy capsized in rough seas. The loss of life brought the death toll of those using the central Mediterranean route to about 1,500 since the start of the year, according to the International Organization for Migration. A growing number of migrant boats are also heading to Italy, via Greek territorial waters from Turkey, with almost 12,000 sailings being recorded this year. “What we are seeing with ever greater intensity is that people are attempting such journeys in all seasons,” said Kokkalas. “It’s no longer a seasonal phenomenon that happens only in the spring and summer.” Greece’s shipping ministry said a naval frigate, four coastguard vessels, three Super Puma helicopters, a C-130 military transport plane, three passing ships and three private craft had participated in Wednesday’s search and rescue operation. All were seconded after the boat sank at about 8pm on Tuesday. Hellenic air force helicopters were expected to continue scouring the area throughout the night. Earlier, authorities found 12 people who had managed to escape in an inflatable dinghy that had initially been tethered to the ill-fated vessel. The survivors, who included a woman and four adolescents, were predominantly from Iraq although three Syrians and two Egyptians were also among them, according to officials. One survivor told the Greek coastguard that the boat had begun taking in water after running into engine trouble and that as many as 50 people could have been on board. Giorgos Skordilis, a shipping ministry official, said that witnesses had described the boat sinking within minutes. “It was obviously totally unseaworthy and began to sink quickly,” he said. “From what we understand it was packed solid with people.” Although arrivals have dropped dramatically with the militarisation of its land and sea frontier – and, say rights groups, persistent “pushbacks” of boats carrying asylum seekers – Greece remains an initial destination for many attempting to enter the EU. On a regional tour earlier this month, Pope Francis described the Mediterranean as a “cemetery without tombstones” and castigated Europe for hardening its border policies with the sole aim of keeping asylum seekers out. “These [shipwrecks] are a strong reminder that people continue to risk their lives taking desperate journeys in search of safety,” said Stella Nanou, the organisation’s spokesperson in Athens. “They underscore the need for more regular pathways to be created. If there were legal and safe routes, those seeking refuge would have a choice.” Currently, she said, people were faced with “the impossible dilemma” of having to decide whether to risk their lives by remaining in their home countries or embark on dangerous voyages with “the small chance” of making it to Europe. NGOs have increasingly voiced alarm at the intensity of the deterrence policies adopted at the EU external borders. In recent months Greece has erected a 40 km-long steel wall along the land frontier it shares with Turkey and deployed sound cannon capable of firing bursts of deafening noise as part of a concerted EU-strategy to deter migrants.",News/World news,Dozens of refugees believed dead after boat sinks in Greek waters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/boat-sinks-greece-folegandros-refugees
12/23/2021,"An online gambling firm that contacted older people and persuaded them to bet tens of thousands of pounds on lottery results is to escape sanctions, despite a damning regulatory investigation into its practices. IMME Ltd, which is based in the Isle of Man and trades as Lotteries.com and The Lottery Centre, committed extensive breaches of its gambling licence, according to the Gambling Commission.  The firm’s sales agents, who used fake names on the phone, “disproportionately” targeted older people, it said, with 75% of customers aged 60 to 79 and 20% 80 or older. One customer, who was 100 when the commission began its review, bet £23,839 in just five months without IMME inquiring about his source of funds. The company knew two of its top depositors were retired postal workers but allowed one to bet £20,345 in five months and the other £16,207 in six months. According to the report, staff members appeared to have no access to customers’ records, meaning they could not carry out responsible gambling checks. The company held no records of its interactions with a 78-year-old customer who spent £63,951 in just over three months. The Gambling Commission’s review also found multiple failings in the way the company marketed its services. The Lotteries.com website is no longer active in the UK but an archived version displays logos for national lotteries around the world and refers to “record-breaking jackpots”. However, the company was not in fact offering the chance to enter lotteries, only the opportunity to bet on their outcome. This was not made clear, the review found. In addition, the website claimed that when customers were betting on a lottery, they were also contributing to underlying good causes. This was not the case. IMME drummed up business by repeatedly telephoning older people, the review found. One woman in her 90s was called several times a week, while another was called every 30-40 minutes until the phone was answered. IMME does not have a website and its two main brands are no longer accessible from the UK. Documents filed with the Isle of Man companies registry in September 2020 name Gloria Jean Evans, a Canadian, as its director, with an address in the island’s capital, Douglas. Its finance director was named as Paul Michael Whelan, an Irish national based in Hertfordshire. puts Both Evans and Whelan have surrendered personal licences to run a gambling business, according to Gambling Commission records. A spokesperson for IMME said the regulator had not acknowledged that many of the failings were “legacy issues” that had been addressed, including via investment in compliance. “IMME ensures that every player is telephoned as soon as they spend £160 and every player is assigned a customer care agent who monitored their play,” it said. “Additionally, all players over 70 years of age received a social interaction call after every sale regardless of size.” The company said it would return any customer funds it still held and had run an “extensive” effort to do so since September. It added that it had decided to withdraw from licensed gambling in the UK. IMME’s licence to operate was suspended in March 2020 the Gambling Commission said it would have been revoked had the company not surrendered it, adding that the company had failed to cooperate with the investigation. Because IMME and its senior staff surrendered their licences, the Gambling Commission can take no further action against them. Matt Zarb-Cousin, director of campaign group Clean Up Gambling, said the case underlined the regulator’s lack of resources, particularly since it took on responsibility for monitoring offshore-owned entities in 2014. “Wholly inadequate due diligence around that time has left the regulator playing catch-up, while being under-resourced,” he said. “It should have the capacity to review every single licensee to ensure these practices are not repeated.” A review of gambling regulation will consider a possible significant increase in funding for the commission. Helen Venn, the executive director of the Gambling Commission, said: “There is no room in Britain’s gambling industry for operators who fail in the way IMME have.” The regulator said the company was still running a lottery ticket syndicate business, which it does not require a Gambling Commission licence to do.",News/Society,Gambling firm that coaxed older people to bet thousands will escape sanctions ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/22/gambling-firm-coaxed-older-people-to-bet-thousands-to-escape-sanctions-isle-of-mann-imme
12/23/2021,"The Wasps head coach, Lee Blackett, has called on the Premiership to consider pausing the season if matches are forced behind closed doors by the continued spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Matches in Wales and Scotland will be played in effectively spectator-free stadiums from Boxing Day and Blackett believes calling a temporary halt to fixtures would be in the best financial interest of the clubs if the government introduces similar measures in England. He has also suggested that the postponed games could be played in midweeks later in the season given there are no free weekends in the calendar.  Clubs are hopeful their festive fixtures will go ahead with bumper crowds as planned – Wasps are due to host London Irish on Boxing Day – but on Wednesday the health secretary, Sajid Javid, reiterated the government’s position that tighter restrictions could not be ruled out after Christmas as more than 100,000 daily Covid cases were recorded in the UK for the first time. This week Bristol’s director of rugby, Pat Lam, warned that clubs would struggle to survive another lockdown after some were driven to the brink of bankruptcy by having to play so many matches in empty stadiums when rugby union resumed last August. Exeter were at one stage losing £1m a month and the clubs’ plight was aggravated by a swingeing cut to central funding from the Rugby Football Union. “I don’t think anyone wants three or four weeks without supporters. If that is the case we’ll have to look at a circuit-break,” Blackett said. “From my perspective that’s where I’d want to go as everyone needs supporters in from a player/coaching side as players play better with them in. It is proven the intensity of games is higher. “So if we can have that little break, and then we might have to play midweek, it would be for the best interests of the club financially, definitely, and for the players as well. Everyone wants to play with supporters – that’s the selfish perspective. Everyone sees that, as it’s a better spectacle for sport, and for TV.” Playing midweek matches would be a controversial move on player welfare grounds but when the 2019-20 season resumed last August they were considered a necessary evil to ensure the fixture list was completed in full. Blackett added: “[A circuit-breaker] is my personal view, I just think it’s the best thing for the game. I can’t imagine clubs are going to say: ‘Let’s play three weeks with no fans.’ If we had to take a three-week break without fans I’m pretty sure everyone would be on the same page.”",Sport/Sport,Wasps head coach Lee Blackett calls for Premiership pause if fans are shut out,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/22/wasps-head-coach-calls-for-premiership-pause-if-fans-are-banned
12/23/2021,"The EU has taken a first step in setting a 15% minimum corporate tax for multinationals, in line with a global agreement struck earlier this year, as the White House has hit a hurdle in its efforts to turn the pact into law. Announcing the launch of a new EU tax directive, Paolo Gentiloni, commissioner for the economy, said he expected the 27 member states to agree on the fine details within six months despite concerns held in some European capitals.  The draft directive, which sets an effective corporate tax rate of 15% for multinationals and other large businesses with a turnover in excess of €750m, enacts an agreement signed by 136 countries and jurisdictions earlier this year. US president Joe Biden drove that agreement forward among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and elsewhere, but is facing difficulties in enacting domestic legislation. The tax rate change has been bundled into his Build Back Better Act, which includes funding for social security and battling the climate emergency. Hungary and Estonia have raised concerns about the minimum rate in recent months. But Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister, said he was convinced that the directive would secure the necessary EU unanimity and that the White House would overcome its obstacles. “I don’t think that the discussion ongoing in the US is concentrated on this issue of corporate taxation, and the contact that we have constantly with the administration shows that the chance to go on with the legislation is absolutely there,” he said. Hungary has a corporate tax rate of 9% and is at odds with the European Commission over its failure to sign off plans for spending billions of euros in recovery funds. The Estonian government has raised concerns about the impact of the minimum rate on its attractiveness to foreign direct investment. Gentiloni said: “We are not abolishing tax competition. We will still have very different levels of corporate taxation in different countries. What we are introducing is a ceiling, a limit, to the race to the bottom.” The draft directive includes a number of exemptions. Companies will be able to exclude an amount of income equal to 5% of the value of tangible assets and 5% of payroll when calculating tax due. For a transition period of 10 years, the exclusions will be higher, starting at 8% of tangible assets and 10% of payroll. Tove Maria Ryding, from the European Network on Debt and Development, representing 53 NGOs that work on the issue, said: “We are in the midst of a global crisis, but unfortunately neither the EU nor the OECD has had the courage to propose a really ambitious reform of the corporate tax rules, which could have mobilised the billions needed to fill gaps in the budgets. “Today’s EU tax package is a Christmas present to all the multinational corporations that will be able to continue paying very low taxes.”",News/World news,EU to combat taxation ‘race to the bottom’ with 15% rate for big companies ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/eu-to-combat-taxation-race-to-the-bottom-with-15-rate-for-corporations
12/23/2021,"Barcelona have agreed an initial €55m (£46.7m) deal to sign Ferran Torres from Manchester City, with additional clauses that could take the fee to €65m. The La Liga club are expected to offer the Spain international a lucrative five-year contract, despite their widely reported financial issues.  Torres could travel to Spain in the next 24 hours to finalise contract arrangements and undergo a medical, with Barcelona already working on a statement to announce his signing. The 21-year-old has not featured for City since late September after injuring a foot on international duty but has resumed training and his condition is not expected to be a barrier to a move. Before his injury, the forward had been in excellent form, scoring seven in 11 appearances for club and country. Torres has been seen as a priority target for Barcelona’s manager, Xavi Hernández, particularly with the premature retirement of Sergio Agüero, who moved to the Camp Nou from City in the summer but managed only 339 minutes before suffering chest pains against Alavés in late October. Agüero confirmed his retirement this month due to a heart problem. Barcelona are seventh in La Liga, two points off a top-four berth. Lowered expectations, the arrival of Xavi, the emergence of Gavi and the new long-term contracts for Pedri and Ansu Fati have improved the club’s outlook after a miserable summer that saw Lionel Messi leave against a backdrop mounting debt.

12/23/2021,"The Scottish Professional Football League is edging closer to a decision that would lead to its top flight being halted after the Boxing Day matches, with a planned winter break brought forward by two rounds of fixtures. SPFL clubs have been involved in talks after Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, announced only 500 spectators could attend matches from 26 December.  Ten Scottish Premiership clubs – Rangers and Ross County the exceptions – have stated their belief to the SPFL that the winter break should be expedited. This would mean neither the Old Firm match, due to be played at Celtic Park on 2 January, nor the Edinburgh derby a day later would appear in its planned live position on Sky Sports. The same would apply to Aberdeen v Rangers on 29 December. Celtic, Hearts, Dundee United, Hibs, St Johnstone, Livingston, Motherwell, Dundee and Aberdeen have publicly stated games before the winter break should be rescheduled. St Mirren had a request rejected by the SPFL to postpone the match on Wednesday night against Celtic because of Covid issues among players and staff. The league warned clubs during talks late on Tuesday that Sky places a value of about £500,000 on any ‘lost’ fixtures but there is hope they would be rescheduled to a suitable television window. The SPFL hopes playing on Boxing Day – when Celtic’s visit to St Johnstone is scheduled on Sky – affords it a little more date leeway, with the league restarting in the week commencing 17 January. As things stand, league games restart on 26 January with the Scottish Cup’s fourth round earmarked for the preceding weekend. The dates situation is complicated by the ongoing involvement of Celtic and Rangers in European competition and that Uefa does not allow leagues to schedule top-flight television matches against its own tournaments. On Wednesday the league asked clubs to state their preference between carrying on to the planned break date of 3 January, stopping games after Boxing Day or stopping immediately. Conscious of club sentiment but also the potential for serious fixture congestion into the new year, the SPFL executive has recommended that clubs choose the second option. Late on Wednesday or on Thursday morning the league’s board, which includes representatives of Rangers and Ross County, is expected to make clear what will happen. Rangers are yet to offer public comment but in front of fellow clubs they questioned the point in advancing a shutdown with the supposed peak of the omicron variant’s impact a number of weeks away. It remains uncertain what will happen with the lower three Scottish divisions or, indeed, whether Premiership clubs will admit 500 people on Boxing Day as opposed to the more practical scenario of locking their gates entirely.",Sport/Football,Scottish Premiership set for early winter break due to Covid restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/22/scottish-league-set-to-bring-forward-its-winter-break-due-to-covid
12/23/2021,"Judy Murray has won an eight-year planning battle to build a £40m tennis and golf complex on the outskirts of Dunblane that she says will stand as a fitting legacy for her sons, tennis stars Andy and Jamie. But local campaigners and community councillors have vowed to continue their fight to prevent building on the green belt land, Park of Keir.  Earlier this week the Scottish government overturned a previous ruling by Stirling council, which had rejected the plans after more than 1,000 objections. Opponents argued that the complex – which will include 19 luxury homes, an 18-hole golf course and a four-star hotel – would destroy the rolling landscape and native woodland of Park of Keir. Timothy Bain, who rules on appeals against planning authorities for Holyrood ministers, decided the benefits of the proposed scheme were sufficient to outweigh the loss of green belt land, concluding the tennis and golf centre in particular “would make an important contribution to the aim of increasing participation in both sports while providing facilities for the community. There will also be economic benefits, to the local area and more widely.” Murray welcomed the decision. “We passionately believe that what we will create will not only serve as a legacy to the achievements of Jamie and Andy, but will be an important community asset that allows people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds to enjoy for generations to come,” she said. But the Scottish Green MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, Mark Ruskell, said the decision had left him feeling “gutted”. “This is a decision that will destroy the historic landscape of Park of Keir that has existed for centuries,” he said. Ruskell believes the developers’ vision has little to do with the Murray tennis legacy. “It’s about securing an exclusive development of rural mansions for the property developer who is hiding behind celebrities,” he said. The partnership, which includes Murray, golfer Colin Montgomerie and local developers the King Group, argue the park is the ideal location to create “grassroots facilities which will make tennis, golf and many other sports accessible to all”. As well as creating a Sir Andy Murray Museum, the site will include a 61-hectare (150-acre) community park with woodland walks, a children’s adventure playground and an all-weather pitch for five-a-side football. In a statement, Dunblane community council said the decision “ignores widespread local concerns and makes a mockery of the planning process”. Its chair, David Prescott, added: “This has taken eight years to get to the grant of planning in principle, which is only a step along the way. This has a long way to go yet.”",Sport/Sport,Judy Murray wins battle to build £40m tennis and golf complex,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/22/40m-dunblane-tennis-complex-greenlit-against-local-objections
12/23/2021,"Almost a third of all children on free school meals in England benefited from government-sponsored activities and free meals over the summer holidays, according to figures from the Department for Education (DfE). More than 495,000 children from deprived backgrounds took part in the holiday activity and food clubs funded by the government and councils. Figures collated for the DfE show that 600,000 children in total took part, including those not eligible for free school meals who were considered to be in need of extra support by their local authorities.  Annual funding for the programme was boosted to £220m this year, in the wake of campaigns by the Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford, who highlighted holiday food poverty among deprived families during the pandemic. In January this year, more than 1.7 million children were eligible for free school meals during term time, a sharp rise on the figure of 1.4 million eligible before the Covid outbreak. Independent evaluation of the holiday programme’s impact is to be published next year. The DfE said that feedback from families who took part this summer included parents of children in Birmingham reporting less stress, with nearly three-quarters saying their children were “less likely to engage in antisocial behaviour”. This year, councils are running the activity and food clubs over Christmas for the first time, and the programme is to continue over the Easter and summer holidays for the next three years. Simon Clarke, the Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “I have seen for myself the difference this support makes to children’s holiday experiences and to their getting a proper nutritious meal, and it’s really powerful.” James Bowen, director of policy for the National Association of Head Teachers, said while the positive impact and funding was good news, school leaders were seeing more families struggling and more children living in poverty. “Coronavirus has only exacerbated this and has shown just how vulnerable many families really are. We’d like to see more done to tackle the root causes of poverty to eliminate the problem,” Bowen said. A separate report on the government’s national school breakfast programme found evidence that free, healthy breakfasts aimed at children from low-income families had a positive impact on behaviour, attainment and eating habits. The breakfast programme began in 2018, for schools with at least half of their pupils from the most deprived households. The schools received free food, advice and a £500 grant, and 325,000 pupils took part at the scheme’s peak.",News/Education,"Nearly half a million deprived children took part in summer scheme, says DfE",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/22/deprived-children-summer-scheme-dfe-free-school-meals
12/23/2021,"Gary Younge’s typically thoughtful and informative article (What Covid taugh us about racism – and what we need to do now, 16 December) makes the excellent proposal that local meetings could address the issue of systemic racism. I do hope this can be taken forward. If such a scheme took off, it could go a long way in changing attitudes and might lead to consistent pressure on any government to do much more to tackle racism. He also makes the point that one of the reasons for racial disadvantage is inequality, because many ethnic minority people are in the worst jobs and living in the poorest conditions. While it is clear that reducing inequality would not automatically eliminate racism, it would undoubtedly be a great help. As made clear in the research by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, inequality increases so many problems in society, not least the distrust between different communities.  Reducing inequality would not only improve the conditions of non-white people, it would also reduce the incentive for white people to blame ethnic minorities –unfairly – for their own difficulties. Younge makes the point that even the Labour party does little more than pay lip service to the need to tackle racism. This is also true of its approach to inequality. While Jeremy Corbyn was leader, there seemed a prospect that we might have a Labour government that would seriously tackle these issues. Unfortunately, with Keir Starmer in charge, this seems an unlikely prospect.Martin WrightOtley, West Yorkshire  In a characteristically insightful contribution, Gary Younge highlights the systematic nature of racism, the spontaneity of the mass protests in the light of the George Floyd murder and the backlash to this movement. The government’s response to the protests was to set up a commission on race and ethnic disparities that produced a report that was remarkably consonant with the position of the Conservative government and played down the significance of racism. It should be added that the government’s cynicism has no bounds, since nine months after publication, it has yet to respond to the recommendations in the study it commissioned, let alone implement them.Prof Andrew PilkingtonUniversity of Northampton  I’ve just read Gary Younge’s sobering piece about systemic racism in the UK. It’s depressing that this is still such a live issue, but I do think that it seems to miss one vital angle. It should be linked explicitly to the legacy of colonialism – or perhaps more aptly named neocolonialism – that sees people in the UK buy products from the global south, where all too often pay and conditions are appalling. There are campaigning groups that address such vital issues, of course, such as Labour Behind the Label, Fashion Revolution, Traidcraft Exchange and Global Justice Now. However, a broader, unifying perspective could prove powerful in getting to the roots of the exploitation of people of colour in the UK and globally. Mobile phones are a product that starkly illustrates a key aspect of the rampant injustice.

12/23/2021,"Although Henrietta Heald (Letters, 19 December) is correct in saying that girls by and large are not admitted to Eton, that is not to say that being female necessarily spares you from the trammels of the independent boarding school system. In the 1970s, I spent six years at Wycombe Abbey, a girls’ public school in Buckinghamshire. My parents thought that by buying a “good” education for me, they were acting in my best interests. Homesick, useless both at lacrosse and tennis, anarchic – “Why shouldn’t I go shopping in my free time? It’s what every normal 16-year-old does,” I once argued to my dismayed housemistress – and endlessly at war with the totalitarian regime of the place, I was an unhappy square peg in a round hole. At university, I lost my way badly – I scraped a third-class degree and seem to have spent the rest of my life trying to recover.  Admittedly, only a minute percentage of the population attends residential schools. Some may even claim to enjoy the boarding experience. But for many – girls as well as boys – the boarding environment can be a source of lifelong insecurity and depression. Let us hope that Richard Beard’s Sad Little Men makes its mark, and that well-to-do parents find something less damaging on which to spend their money.Victoria OwensLong Ashton, Somerset  While I agree with Henrietta Heald’s view, not everyone who was sent away to school – in my case at eight – turns out to be the Sad Little Men described in Richard Beard’s book. I do not defend the system – there is much wrong with it and I endured some very unpleasant experiences. However, contrary to expectation, I don’t find connection and real empathy a challenge. That would have severely hampered me in my work as a psychologist, a psychotherapist and an employee of a charity working for 30 years with disadvantaged people from a wide range of backgrounds. How did I manage this? Partly, I suspect, because there were some teachers prepared to provide a correcting perspective on our situation.

12/23/2021,"I keep reading statistics that vaccine take-up in the 12- to 15-year-old age group is low. Take-up implies that there is a choice, but low rates are surely the result of several factors? First, it is extremely difficult to get a local vaccination appointment for a teenager. I’ve found one – but it involves a 44-mile round trip by car. Second, since Covid rates have been so high in the unvaccinated, unmasked teenagers attending school, take-up will be lower because, according to what my GP surgery told me, children still aren’t allowed the vaccination for 90 days after a positive test.  Third, over the autumn term we were assured that children aged 13 would receive them in school, so parents didn’t attempt to arrange vaccinations. Unfortunately, the mass Covid vaccinations didn’t take place in many schools for this age group. My friends on the other side of the country have had similar experiences. Take-up is low among children aged 12-15 because they cannot “take” what hasn’t actually been made available to them.
