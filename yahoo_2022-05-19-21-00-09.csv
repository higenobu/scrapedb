5/19/2022,"A cofounder of the Black Lives Matter Foundation paid her brother $840,000, per tax documents. He was hired to help with security as organizers didn't trust other firms with the matter. The tax filing details how the foundation spent much of the $90 million it received in donations. A cofounder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation used donated funds to pay her brother $840,000 for ""professional security services,"" according to tax documents filed with the IRS. The filing showed that Patrisse Cullors, the organization's one-time executive director, paid the sum to Cullors Protection, a company owned by her brother Paul Cullors. Paul Cullors is also a graffiti artist, according to an artist description on Crenshaw Dairy Mart — an artist collective co-founded by Patrisse Cullors. He was previously cited in the New York Magazine as BLM's head of security. Shalomyah Bowers, the foundation's board secretary, told the Associated Press that Paul Cullors' company was hired because the group — which often protests against law-enforcement organizations — felt that its protection could not be entrusted to former police officers who typically run security firms. According to the tax filing, the organization also paid more than $969,000 for live-event, design, and media production to Trap Heals LLC, a company founded by Damon Turner, who fathered a child with Patrisse Cullors. According to an exclusive published by the AP in February last year, the BLM foundation received around $90 million in donations in 2020 alone. Several Black activists and supporters of the movement have called for more transparency on how the money received is being used. The newly reported filing — which covers the period of July 1, 2020, to June 20, 2021 — was given exclusively to The AP and showed that the organization received a revenue of $79 million in that time. The documents also said that the foundation has $42 million in net assets. The filing stated that BLM invested $32 million in stocks, which organizers told the AP would help to ensure that the foundation's work continues in the future. Another $6 million was spent on a Studio City home in Los Angeles that was meant as a retreat for a Black artist fellowship. Organizers told the AP that the property — which has six bedrooms and bathrooms, a swimming pool, a soundstage, and office space — is still being used for that purpose. BLM spent around $37.7 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, including the payments to Trap Heals and Cullors Protection, per the tax filing. The documents show that about $26 million was used on grants to organizations, local chapters, and families. This included grants of $2.3 million to the non-profit organization Living Through Giving Foundation, $1.4 million to The Michael O.D. Brown We Love Our Sons & Daughters Foundation, and $200,000 to the Trayvon Martin Foundation. Patrisse Cullors, who stepped down as the foundation's executive director in May last year, did not take any financial compensation for her work in the organization, the filing showed.

5/19/2022,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford is asking the owners of 350,000 vehicles in to take them to dealers for repairs in three recalls, including about 39,000 that should be parked outdoors because the engines can catch fire. Ford says in U.S. government documents posted Thursday that it doesn't know what's causing fires in some 2021 Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. But the company says fires can happen even while the engines are off. Ford has reports of 16 fires under the hood, 14 in rental company vehicles. One person was burned. It's recommending that the SUVs be parked outdoors and away from buildings. So far it hasn't developed a repair for the fires, which appear to start at the back of the engine compartment on the passenger side. Of the 16 fires, 12 happened while the SUV engines were turned off, Ford said in a prepared statement. The company says it has no reports of fires extending to any buildings. Ford says it’s not instructing owners to stop driving the SUVs, although those who might not be able to follow the park outdoors instructions should contact their dealer or the company. Ford says it’s treating the recall urgently and will use apps and mail to notify customers as soon as it develops a list of vehicle owners and addresses. “We are working around the clock to determine the root cause of this issue and subsequent remedy so that customers can continue to enjoy using their vehicles,” Jeffrey Marentic, general manager of Ford passenger vehicles, said in a statement. Ford began investigating fire reports on March 24. It says the fires appear to be limited to SUVs built from Dec. 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021. The company says it has no fire reports from vehicles built before or after those dates. The automaker also is recalling about 310,000 heavy-duty trucks because the driver's air bag may not inflate in a crash. The recall covers certain 2016 F-250, 350, 450 and 550 trucks. Dust can get into the air bag wiring in the steering wheel, disconnecting the electricity. Dealers will replace steering wheel wiring. Owners will be notified by mail starting July 5. And the company is recalling 464 electric Mustang Mach-E SUVs from 2021. A software problem can cause unintended acceleration, deceleration or a loss of drive power in all-wheel-drive vehicles. Ford says in documents posted Thursday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the powertrain control computer may not detect a software error. The problem will be fixed by dealers or by an online software update. Owners will be notified by letter around May 30.",U.S./Associated Press,Park outdoors: Ford recalls SUVs due to engine fire risk,https://news.yahoo.com/park-outdoors-ford-recalls-suvs-104446167.html
