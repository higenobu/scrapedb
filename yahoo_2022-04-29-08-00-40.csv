4/29/2022,"Shares of Facebook parent Meta (FB) soared in early trading Thursday on the back of its Q1 earnings report. Shares of the social media giant were up more than 14% despite a miss on revenue expectations, as investors and analysts digested the company’s plans to scale back spending. On the surface, Meta’s report wasn’t all that great. It missed on revenue estimates, with analysts expecting the company to bring in $28.24 billion rather than the $27.9 billion it reported. But the company saw better adjusted earnings per share than initially projected. More importantly, though, Meta’s Facebook app is once again adding users, with users increasing 4% to 1.96 billion daily active users after the app lost 1 million last quarter. “Consistent with our checks, the quarter was below expectations due to geopolitical concerns, continued iOS privacy challenges and transition to Reels,” Mizuho analyst James Lee wrote in a note following the report. “With that in mind, [Q2 2022] guidance came below the street at flat [year-over-year], as the increasingly uncertain macro outlook magnifies the impact of Facebook’s platform and tech-stack transitions. On the positive side, [daily active user] growth was reversed to positive due to increased engagement from Reels,” Lee wrote. Meta’s stock is coming off of an incredible downturn following its prior earnings report. Ahead of Wednesday’s report, shares of the company were off as much as 41% over the last three months. The most positive news for investors, however, came from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said that while the company continues to invest in the metaverse under its Reality Labs business — $2.96 billion in Q1 alone — monetizing its family of social apps is still a major priority. “On the Family of Apps side, I am confident that we can return to better revenue growth rates over time and sustain high operating margins,” Zuckerberg said during Meta’s earnings call. “In Reality Labs, we're making large investments to deliver the next platform that I believe will be incredibly important both for our mission and business — comparable in value to the leading mobile platforms today. I recognize that it's expensive to build this — it's something that's never been built before and it's a new paradigm for computing and social connection.” Zuckerberg is plowing forward with his plans for the metaverse, a nascent series of interconnected online worlds. But whether or not the average consumer will dive into the metaverse remains to be seen. Revenue from Reality Labs, which includes sales of Oculus headsets and software, came in at $695 million for the quarter, a jump from the $534 million the segment brought in the same quarter last year. Meta also recently opened up its first physical store dedicated to its metaverse products. Still, headsets and the metaverse in general are still far from mainstream among consumers. And whether or not it will ever reach that level of penetration will take years to understand. Meta also continues to deal with headwinds for its advertising business. The company specifically pointed to the war in Ukraine and its impact on European spending, as well as recent privacy changes to Apple's (AAPL) iOS, which allow consumers to opt out of having apps follow them. Meta says the iOS changes alone will knock $10 billion off revenue in 2022. Meta isn’t the only company dealing with iOS issues. Alphabet announced during its earnings that YouTube is facing similar problems, but competitors like Snap seem to be less vulnerable to the privacy changes. That said, Meta’s results were clearly ahead of the basement-level expectations that investors had going into the quarter. If it can continue that kind of performance moving forward, it could be setting itself up for bigger wins in the coming quarters.

4/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- More New York apartment renters are declining to renew leases as they’re being presented with post-pandemic rate increases, landlord Equity Residential said.

The drop comes as tenants who secured deep discounts during the pandemic leasing lull face the dilemma of paying more to renew or hunting for a cheaper place in a competitive market. Across Manhattan, the first-quarter vacancy rate was below 2%, and rents were up 25% from early 2021, according to appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Related: Manhattan Rents Soar More Than 25% Across Most Neighborhoods For Equity Residential’s New York leases that were renewed in the quarter, the net effective rent hike was 21%, up from 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increases were even higher for new agreements, with net effective pricing up 29.7% in the region. The company’s New York area properties are in Manhattan, Brooklyn and New Jersey. New York was the strongest market for the REIT, which also operates in areas including Southern California, San Francisco and Boston, where increases for new leases and renewals were in the low teens. One setback in the quarter was a higher-than-expected delinquency rate in Southern California, which the company attributed to residents applying for the state’s pandemic rent relief program as it was extended through March 2022. Since the start of April, the REIT has seen signs that some previously delinquent tenants are paying their rents.

4/29/2022,"Warren Buffett is sitting pretty on Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Occidental Petroleum (OXY) — up 91% this year. As investors grapple with a frustrating trading environment this year, one veteran portfolio manager has a unique perspective on why Buffett is piling into the oil company. Buffett first dipped his toes in OXY in 2019, when he bought $10 billion in preferred shares — paying a fat, 8% dividend — along with warrants to buy 84 million shares. Buffett maintains the position to this day, but stayed away from its common stock for years. That is, until he read the earnings transcript from the Occidental's February 25 earnings call. ""W]e know exactly what hit [Buffett] like a ton of bricks,"" Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, said at a recent Yahoo Finance Plus webinar. It was CEO Vicki Hollub, who thoroughly impressed Buffett, leading the Oracle of Omaha to later say in an interview she was ""running the company the right way."" Buffett promptly went on a buying spree, scooping up 136.4 million shares worth $7.7 billion — 14.6% of the company. (The position is Berkshire's eighth largest.) Thanks to surging oil prices, Occidental is generating piles of cash — $2.9 billion of free cash flow in the last quarter, noted Smead. ""[A]at the time that [Buffett] started buying [Occidental stock], maybe they had a market cap of what — maybe $40 to $45 billion — where annually, it means they're generating 25% of their market cap at that time [in] free cash flow,"" he said. Occidental is returning much of that capital to its shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends — quite the turnaround from its 2020 low when it had plunged 93% from its 2011 record high of $117.89. Flush with cash, OXY is also paying down its sizable debt load — much of which was raised to finance its $55 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019. The company reported long-term debt of $29.4 billion as of year-end 2021. But this elevated liabilities load may have been a selling point, as being ""short"" bonds has been one of the best trades of 2022. ""If anybody likes to think about the hedge fund world, the perfect trade on January 1 of this year was to be short long-term bonds,"" Smead said. ""And what was OXY on January 1? Short bonds that they'd sold to buy Anadarko long oil."" Smead then divined the Oracle's thought process as he was reading that Occidental earnings transcript in February. ""Buffett is looking at this and going — wait a second — a company that used to not have great returns on equity is about to go through great returns on equity in a way that he never could have envisioned."" Smead also sees the potential for Berkshire to fully acquire Occidental — which at its current market capitalization of $52 billion — would be Buffett's largest purchase ever. ""I'd say there's maybe a one in four or one in three chance,"" Smead said, ""which is a very good chance."" Jared Blikre is a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance Live.

4/29/2022,"Washington — President Biden said he is ""taking a hard look"" into forgiving some federal student loan debt on Thursday, but the amount he is considering is less than $50,000 per borrower, lower than some top Democrats have been seeking since he took office. ""I am considering dealing with some debt reduction,"" Mr. Biden said in response to a question at the White House. ""I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction. But I'm in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there will be additional debt forgiveness."" The president said he would have an answer on forgiving additional debt in the ""next couple of weeks."" Mr. Biden's comments came days after he gave one of his strongest signals yet that he's looking to cancel student loan debt during a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Monday. Democratic Rep. Tony Cardenas of California, who attended the meeting, said the president never mentioned a specific amount he was looking to cancel, but said he was open to forgiving debt for borrowers regardless of whether they attended private or public institutions. When the lawmaker reiterated that the caucus supports canceling $10,000 in student loan debt, the president said, ""You're going to like what I do,"" according to Cardenas. In response to the president's meeting on Monday, some Republican lawmakers blasted Mr. Biden for looking at forgiving student loan debt. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah tweeted that ""Desperate polls call for desperate measures,"" and mockingly suggested Mr. Biden was trying to ""bribe"" voters. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden said he would cancel $10,000 in student loan debt and called for Congress to act. He has extended the pandemic-related pause on federal student loan repayment several times, most recently through August 31. The White House has previously raised concerns that widespread federal student debt cancellation could face legal challenges if done through executive action, and the president last year asked his team to evaluate his legal options. Pressure on Mr. Biden to act has been mounting as the midterm elections approach. Some Democrats, like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have reiterated their calls for the president to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt, an amount that appears to be off the table for now. White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said a decision on canceling student loan debt would be made between now and August 31, when loan payments are set to resume. Some Republican lawmakers and organizations oppose extending the pandemic-era pause, which saves some 41 million borrowers an estimated $5 billion a month in student loan interest payments. The pause was previously set to expire at the beginning of May. In the meantime, the Education Department has made some changes to existing loan forgiveness programs. Since taking office, the Biden administration has forgiven more than $17 billion in student loan debt, including for borrowers who were defrauded by their schools, those with permanent disabilities and those in income-driven repayment plans or the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.",Politics/CBS MoneyWatch•3 hours ago,"Biden says he's considering forgiving student debt, but not $50,000",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-says-hes-considering-forgiving-193416129.html
4/29/2022,"If you wanted to be a fly on the wall during the first Twitter all-hands meeting after the platform accepted Elon Musk's $44 billion bid, you're in luck. Audio from Twitter's companywide call about its drastic change from being a publicly traded company to a billionaire-owned, private entity was leaked by the conservative activist group, Project Veritas, on YouTube. The group, of course, has a bone to pick with Twitter, as its right-wing founder James O'Keefe was booted from Twitter last year for platform manipulation and spam. The group also has a history of deceptive reporting practices, including the use of misleading video edits. While Twitter declined to comment on the leak, the dialogue appears to be consistent with prior reports about the call. And while Twitter CMO Leslie Berland tweeted that an audio clip from the meeting has been ""leaked, edited and misrepresented as [hers] (and the company's) views,"" it appears she may have been responding to a tweet that showed an edited clip of the audio leak, not the full version. In this short clip, it was not clear that Berland was reading questions from employees, as opposed to speaking on her own behalf. The full leak of the meeting audio makes it clear the questions are coming from employees. Over the 45-minute discussion, CEO Parag Agrawal and independent board chair Bret Taylor fielded the employees' questions, which were relayed via Berland. Many of the answers, however, were some version of ""we need to ask Elon about that."" Until the deal closes, which could take up to six months, Agrawal said, ""[Twitter] will continue making decisions as we always have, guided by the principles we've had, which doesn't mean things won't change. Things have been changing. I've been in this role for four months,"" Agrawal explained. ""Once the deal closes, different decisions might be made. For us to gain insight into that, we'll be finding a way to have Elon talk with all of you at the soonest possible opportunity,"" he said. Elon Musk’s Twitter deal includes a $1 billion termination fee on both sides Still, the questions that employees asked indicated real concern about how the deal would affect their day-to-day work priorities, compensation and stock options, and job security. As previously reported, Agrawal told employees that there would be ""no layoffs at this time,"" which isn't the most assuring possible response. When asked about a potential hiring freeze, Agrawal said that the company hadn't yet thought through the answer to that question. Another concern among employees is how Elon Musk's desire to cultivate ""free speech"" will affect the platform's guidelines. Twitter currently bans hate speech, spam, targeted harassment, COVID-19 misinformation and attempts to manipulate a political election. But Musk has indicated that he wants Twitter's policies to match that of the law -- a statement that doesn't totally hold up for a private social network used in many different countries. An employee asked for more clarity on what Musk may have meant by ""free speech."" Agrawal said everyone understood what free speech meant, as it's a concept that's existed for a while. ""But I think I am going to try and read the question behind the question here, which is, where might Twitter's product go as a private company in the future once the deal closes?"" Agrawal continued. His answer indicated that Twitter wasn't entirely clear on that point at this time. ""To best gain perspective on this … we'll find ways to bring Elon in for a Q&A with all of you,"" he said, adding that the leadership team would also sit down with Musk to better understand ""his vision for the future of Twitter might look like."" Hinting at possible differences of opinion with Twitter's new owner, Agrawal also expressed the desire to have ""a two-way dialogue"" with Musk where Twitter's leadership could ""inform and educate him on the work we have done, and the things we have learned along the way."" Reading between the lines of the comment, even in its heavily massaged corporate-speech format, it seems that Twitter's current leadership doesn't believe Musk has a deep understanding of why Twitter has taken the actions it has with regard to moderation. Optimistically, Agrawal added Twitter's leadership would be looking to understand Musk's ""ambitions and aspirations"" in order to ""see how we can best collaborate."" (Of course, there are already questions being raised as to whether Agrawal would be the one Musk will be ""collaborating"" with, given Musk's statements in an earlier SEC filing about how he did not ""have confidence in [Twitter's] management.) An employee also asked if President Trump's account will be reinstated, but Agrawal didn't give a direct answer here either. Although Trump himself has said he doesn't want to return to Twitter, his mind could change. Trump says he won’t return to Twitter if his account is reinstated ""I think we've been doing our work to learn about what's happening out there. We constantly evolve our policies. We make decisions for the health of the public conversation every day,"" he said. ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go in."" It sounds like Musk will get to make that call, in other words. Another employee noted that Musk has said that part of why he bought the platform was because he disagreed with their content moderation policies. ""This puts Twitter Service, and Trust and Safety, as well as anybody who cares about health on the platform in a very difficult position,"" the question, relayed by Berland, said. The employee asked how these teams will be supported when Musk assumes power. Agrawal began his response by first touting the work Twitter had done to keep conversations safe, free from manipulation and from spam. The latter, however, is one of Musk's larger complaints with the service today, which has been unable to get a handle on the bots and spammers, including more recently, the crypto spammers who often flood Musk's Twitter replies. Agrawal then complimented the teams that work to keep Twitter safe, but he added, ""I believe there is a lot of work we have to do to continue making that better. Sometimes that means more thoughtful moderation, sometimes that means making things simpler, sometimes that means changing product incentives to be able to solve problems through products sometimes instead of policies."" For now, Musk’s takeover bid for Twitter remains subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

4/29/2022,"If there’s one thing certain, it’s that markets are unpredictable – and that unpredictability is increasing. The reasons are multiplying: high inflation is rising higher, wages are not keeping up, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has started Europe’s largest war since 1945, and energy and food commodities – key ingredients in the inflation mix – are sure to rise in price as a result of that fighting. It will be interesting to see, in the coming weeks, just how these cross currents impact the markets, and especially so as we approach the peak of the earnings season. Last year, despite high inflation, saw generally solid earnings numbers; the big question now is, will that continue? The analysts at Goldman Sachs are working to give at least one answer to that question, by finding stocks that are primed to gain in the current environment. They’ve picked out three equities that offer the attractive combination of Buy-ratings and high upside potential – in the Goldman view, triple-digit potential. We ran the trio through TipRanks' database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them. Arcutis Biotherapeutics (ARQT) We'll start with Arcutis, a clinical-stage biopharma company that is working in the dermatology niche, and its chief product, roflumilast (also called ARQ-151), is being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials. In its cream formulation, the drug is being tested as a treatment for atopic dermatitis; in foam formulations, it is undergoing trials for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and scalp and body psoriasis. In an important event for investors, the company reported in December that roflumilast cream’s NDA for the treatment of plaque psoriasis was accepted by the FDA, with a PDUFA date of July 29, 2022. That acceptance opens the way for Arcutis to begin planning commercialization activities for roflumilast cream. In a move that will aid commercialization, the company announced that roflumilast cream has moisturizing properties similar to commercially-marketed, ceramide-containing moisturizing creams. On the clinical side, Arcutis has several Phase 3 trials ongoing. In its most recent clinical update, the company announced that enrollment in the ARRECTOR trial, a Phase 3 pivotal study of roflumilast foam in the treatment of scalp and body psoriasis. This study has 432 subjects enrolled, and topline data is expected in late Q3 or early Q4 of this year. There is a projected patient base of 3 million people for this product. The likely FDA approval and the high profit potential of roflumilast are the key factors behind Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani's bullish stance on ARQT. He writes, ""We expect FDA approval of the NDA by the July 29th PDUFA date and project potential peak sales in the initial psoriasis indication exceeding $1bn in 2036. Our confidence in the company’s ability to execute on the commercial launch derives in particular from what we see as a conservative pricing strategy aimed to improve payor dynamics..."" ""We look for top line data readouts from three Phase 3 studies in mid- to late-2022 to further de-risk additional meaningful commercial opportunities, and in our view, expand the visibility of the company’s ripening portfolio and thus the company as an attractive strategic asset,” the analyst added. All of the above makes it clear why Shibutani is now standing with the bulls. The 5-star analyst rates ARQT a Buy while his $45 price target implies an upside of ~124% for the year ahead. (To watch Shibutani’s track record, click here) Are other analysts in agreement? They are. Only Buy ratings, 4, in fact, have been issued in the last three months, so the consensus rating is a Strong Buy. ARQT is trading for $20.06 and its $47.25 average price target implies an upside of ~136% in the year ahead. (See ARQT stock forecast on TipRanks) Tricida, Inc. (TCDA) Next up is Verrica Pharma, a company focused on the development and commercialization of drug candidate veverimer. Previously known as TRC101, this drug is an orally administered polymer, not absorbed by the human system, that is designed to treat metabolic acidosis – too much acid in the body tissues – by absorbing excess acids. The drug candidate is being studied for its applications to the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Tricida is currently conducting the VALOR-CKD trial. This Phase 3 clinical study follows several previous trials of veverimer, which showed positive data on safety, tolerability, and efficacy. The VALOR trial, underway now, will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug in delaying CKD progression in patients also suffering from related metabolic acidosis. For administrative reasons, the company will be shortening the VALOR trial early. The trial currently has 1,480 subjects enrolled and randomized, and evaluation will continue to the primary endpoint in 3Q22. The company expects to release top line data in 4Q22. On the business side, Tricida had $150.6 million in cash assets on hand at the end of 2021. With Q4 admin and R&D expenses of totaling $45.9 million, this gives a cash runway of nine months. The company has attributed its early end to the VALOR trial to its cash status, stating a need to keep funds available for post-trial operations. Even though the company has admitted that cash is tight, Goldman Sachs takes a sanguine view of this stock. The company’s 5-star analyst Madhu Kumar writes: “We are optimistic on the outlook for veverimer in MA with CKD considering the safety and efficacy in three previous placebo-controlled clinical studies. Specifically, the data show patients experience only mild adverse events (AEs) and achieve improvements in serum bicarbonate (SBC) levels, a key marker for MA with CKD severity, in addition to other key functional outcomes. Given these encouraging results, we look forward to VALOR-CKD results in 4Q22 as the key event for TCDA shares.” These comments support Kumar’s Buy rating on the stock, while his $25 price target implies a one-year upside of 126%. (To watch Kumar’s track record, click here) Overall, there are only 2 recent analyst reviews of TCDA but they both agree that this is a stock to buy, giving the company its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $11 and its $21.50 average target indicate potential for 94% upside in the months ahead. (See TCDA stock forecast on TipRanks) Coupang (CPNG) Now let’s shift gears, to e-commerce, where Coupang is a market leader in South Korea’s online retail sector. The company offers an online platform where customers can buy, well, anything. From pet supplies to kitchen wares to home furnishings to automotive needs to childcare items, it’s all under one electronic roof. In a plus for customers, Coupang also offers a guaranteed fast delivery on more than 5 million items, using its Rocket Delivery network. All of this adds up to big revenue numbers. In the pre-COVID year of 2019, Coupang saw US$5.9 billion in total sales, and during the pandemic crisis year of 2020, with lockdowns keeping everyone home for extended periods – and putting a premium on online retail – Coupang saw revenues double to US$12 billion. In 2021, as economies reopened and people got back to work, they had more money to spend – and didn’t lose their habit of spending online. Coupang’s revenues grew to US$18.4 billion for the year. Last year was also Coupang’s first year as a publicly traded company on Wall Street. It’s quarterly reports for the year showed consistent sequential gains, as well as the broader year-over-year full-year gain. Despite the growing revenues, Coupang still runs quarterly losses – although those losses did moderate in 2021. In the first quarter of last year, the company reported a 68 cent EPS loss; by the end of the year, this down to 23 cents. Looking ahead, however, the Street is predicting a 29 cent per-share loss in 1Q22. Among the bulls is Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Cha who takes a bullish stance on CPNG shares. He writes, ""The market is underestimating Coupang’s operating leverage potential, which we think has been concealed under COVID induced expenses... We especially believe larger improvement in adjusted EBITDA vs. consensus which could surprise the market and improve the overall sentiment on the stock due to improved LT profitability outlook as well as lessen concerns on the burn-rate and cash supply for the company."" To this end, Cha gives CPNG a Buy rating along with a $37 price target. This figure indicates his belief in a 159% upside by year’s end. Looking at the consensus breakdown, 5 Buys and 2 Holds have been published in the last three months. Therefore, CPNG gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Based on the $28.33 average price target, shares could rise 110% in the next twelve months.

4/29/2022,"By Tom Hals (Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk did not unjustly enrich himself when he guided the electric vehicle maker in 2016 to acquire SolarCity Corp, where Musk was chairman and the largest shareholder, a Delaware judge ruled on Wednesday. Tesla shareholders had accused Musk of coercing Tesla's board into buying SolarCity, a struggling rooftop solar panel maker, to rescue his investment, and had sought up to $13 billion in damages. The ruling comes as Musk is tapping his vast fortune to acquire Twitter Inc, which accepted his $44 billion offer on Monday. It also followed a ruling from a separate court earlier in the day that denied a Musk bid to end oversight of his Tesla tweets. ""The preponderance of the evidence reveals that Tesla paid a fair price — SolarCity was, at a minimum, worth what Tesla paid for it, and the acquisition otherwise was highly beneficial to Tesla,"" said the opinion by Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware's Court of Chancery. The ruling can be appealed and a lawyer for the shareholders said he was evaluating potential next steps. ""The case is about loyalty. The court's decision acknowledges that Elon Musk was conflicted and there were flaws in the process,"" said Randall Baron, the attorney for the plaintiffs. There was no immediate response from Tesla or Musk. Slights said Musk was more involved than he should have been, but a fair price for SolarCity outweighed claims the deal unjustly enriched Musk. The ruling follows a 10-day trial in July which included nearly two full days of testimony from Musk. Union pension funds and asset managers alleged that Musk commandeered Tesla's negotiations for SolarCity while publicly claiming to be ""fully recused."" Slights said Musk on several occasions was involved in board discussions of the deal, but he also noted several instances when the board stood up to Musk and declined to follow his wishes, such as the timing of the deal. The all-stock deal was valued at $2.6 billion in 2016. Tesla's stock price has since soared, inflating the value of what Musk received from the SolarCity purchase and in turn the damages sought by the plaintiffs. Musk, the world's richest person with a fortune of around $265.6 billion according to Forbes, had owned about 22% of both companies at the time.

And Deutsche Bank raised the possibility of a ""major recession"" as result of Federal Reserve rate hikes and asset tapering in a recent note. In a new interview, Wall Street veteran and investing guru Sallie Krawcheck took those fears one step further, saying a recession is inevitable. While she acknowledged the timeline and nature of the downturn remain uncertain, Krawcheck urged investors to diversify their holdings in order to withstand the hard economic times. ""Sure, a recession is on the way,"" says Krawcheck, the co-founder and CEO of an investing platform for women called Ellevest. ""I don't know when. Nobody knows when. Inflation will go up at some point [and] down at some point."" As the U.S. struggles with its worst bout of inflation in four decades, the Federal Reserve signaled an aggressive series of rate hikes that may tame cost increases, but could also cool economic growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last Thursday expressed openness to a 50-basis point rate hike in May, noting the potential benefits of ""front loading"" the central bank's policy moves. The onset of tight monetary policy “will push the economy into a significant recession by late next year,"" Deutsche Bank Head of Research David Folkerts-Landau warned in his note on Tuesday. To be sure, some observers have rejected fears of a recession. Canaccord strategist Tony Dwyer told CNBC last month that concern about a recession based on an inversion in parts of the treasury yield curve has been overstated. Since ""the market is so often wrong,"" traders should diversify their portfolios as a hedge against a range of outcomes, said Krawcheck, who formerly led the Wealth Management divisions at both Merrill Lynch and Citi (C). ""A diversified portfolio is what matters because the number of active managers who correctly call this stuff consistently, you and I both know, is a tiny, single-digit percentage,"" she says. Krawcheck began her career on Wall Street as a junior analyst at Solomon Brothers in the late 1980s. Since then, she's witnessed several recessions over more than three decades working in the finance industry, most notably the Great Recession of 2008, when she held a front row seat as a top executive in wealth management at Citi. Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Krawcheck said attempts to play the market in the short term often lead investors astray. ""We tell our women, 'Investing should be sort of boring,'""she says ""It shouldn't be all about making the calls.""

Ten European companies have already opened the accounts at Gazprombank needed to meet Russia’s payment demands, the person said.

Russia supplies gas via pipelines to 23 European countries. After the EU imposed sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow demanded that it be paid in rubles for shipments starting April 1. But the bloc told member states that the mechanism the Kremlin proposed, which required opening euro and ruble accounts with state-controlled Gazprombank, would violate the sanctions.

4/29/2022,"Say ‘electric vehicle’ these days, and Elon Musk is probably the first association that will come to mind. After all, he’s a headline machine – but his Tesla company has proven that electric vehicle (EV) market can be profitable for automakers and investors alike. But cars aren’t the only game in town for investors who want to buy into the EV sector, and worthwhile stocks don’t need to have Tesla-level prices. EVs are bringing a range of supporting technologies and infrastructure with them, from battery manufacturers to charging companies, and savvy investors can find affordable opportunities in that supportive network. Today, we'll look into the charging companies. While they may not exude the same appeal as the car makers, those cars won’t get very far without the charging infrastructure that their support companies will make available. The charging companies, while they may be somewhat speculative for now, are coming onto the scene with a built-in advantage: they service is essential in their industry. We've used the TipRanks database to pinpoint two EV charging stocks that have earned a thumbs up from members of the analyst community. These are Buy-rated firms, currently selling for under $10 per share, and with the chance of doubling or better in the months ahead. Let's take a closer look. Nuvve Holding (NVVE) Nuvve, the first stock we’ll look at, is a truly unique company in the charging station universe. It puts its own twist on charging tech, in a way that can promote the use of renewable energy sources. Simply put, Nuvve uses bidirectional charging stations that can connect EVs to the local electrical grid – and allows the cars’ batteries to act as storage for renewable energy producers or to discharge power back to the local grid when needed. Vehicle owners can pre-set the charging station to provide a fully powered car when the time to drive rolls around. This company entered the public trading markets in March of last year, through a SPAC business combination with Newborn Acquisition Corporation. The NVVE ticker started trading on the NASDAQ on March 23, and the company realized $62 million in cash from the transaction. In the 13 months of trading since, the company’s stock has been highly volatile, and has fallen 54%. Even though the shares have fallen, Nuvve has had positive news to report in its quarterly financial releases. To start with, the company continues to be successful at raising grant revenue, which has risen sequentially in each of the last three quarters; for 4Q21, the last reported, it stood at $1.2 million. In April of this year, Nuvve announced that it had been selected by the US Department of Energy to act as a collaboration partner in the adoption and acceleration of ‘vehicle to grid’ technology, the company’s specialty. The partnership will give Nuvve access to Federal funds, as well as political support. Looking at Nuvve’s recent performance, and the way it has developed its niche, 5-star analyst Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum sees a bullish future ahead. ""We see the move to electrification as inevitable in a host of transportation applications with numerous drivers including the regulatory backdrop, accelerating OEM commitments, and expanding corporate sustainability goals. We also see the need to upgrade and strengthen the electrical grid as an important objective. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) sits at the crossroad of both and NVVE is the market leader with a technology advantage, important partnerships, and it positioned as a key enabler of both of these multi-decade trends,"" Stine opined. Based on the above, it’s no wonder Stine reiterated his Buy rating on Nuvve shares. With a price tag of $16, the analyst believes shares could surge ~155% in the next twelve months. (To watch Stine’s track record, click here) This small-cap firm has slipped under the radar a bit, and only has 3 recent analyst reviews. These all agree, however, that it’s a stock to buy, making the Strong Buy analyst consensus unanimous. The shares are selling for $6.27 and their $22 average target indicates room for a 250% upside over the next 12 months. (See Nuvve stock forecast on TipRanks) Allego (ALLG) Now let’s look over at Europe, where Allego is a leader in the continent’s public EV charging network. The company’s network of charging stations, including more than 28,000 charge points across Europe, also includes more than 750 of the newer fast charging stations. These charge points, usually located in metro areas or near highways, allow drivers to recharge their vehicles in far less time than older charging stations, and can accommodate multiple brands and charging standards of EVs. Allego, which has been in business since 2013, also offers fleet charging services, and is available for tourist use and business accounts. The company’s charging units are compatible with both personal and commercial vehicles, from small cars to larger trucks. Last month, Allego entered the US stock markets through a SPAC transaction. The company merged with Spartan Acquisition Corporation III, in a business combination that brought Allego approximately $161 million in gross proceeds. Gabe Daoud, in his coverage of Allego for Cowen, is unabashedly bullish, saying of the company: “ALLG stands out as a pan-Euro EV charging leader poised to benefit from significant tailwinds that have (and will likely continue) to leave the EU as an EV adoption leader years ahead of the U.S. We see outsized growth in DC energy delivered providing an attractive market opportunity ($20B p.a. by '30) that augurs well for shares.” Just how well it augurs for the shares? Daoud answers: “Our analysis suggests healthy returns with a ~5 year payback period and 22% IRRs based on our forecast of utilization improving to 25% vs. 10% currently. Allego’s business calls for significant expansion beyond the ~800 owned DC ports today, as management expects to develop 1,300 sites in backlog/ pipeline and then some which provides significant operating leverage moving forward.” Altogether, Daoud gives ALLG an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and sets a price target of $19 for the year ahead, implying an upside growth of 123% for the shares. (To watch Daoud’s track record, click here) This new stock has only had time to pick up 2 analyst reviews from the Street – but they are in agreement that it’s a stock to buy, giving ALLG its Moderate Buy consensus view. Allego’s stock is selling for $8.52 and its $17 average price target suggests ~100% upside over the next 12 months.

4/29/2022,"The comedown for the pandemic era stars has been nothing short of brutal and Shopify (SHOP) might be the perfect example of this 180-degree swivel in market trends. With a third of the year behind us, more than two-thirds of the stock’s valuation has disappeared into the ether as investors have turned away in droves, spooked by macro trends and disappointing 4Q21 results indicating the pandemic ecommerce party was well and truly over. What’s more, the company offered a bleak outlook, with the growth expected to slow down some more. With this as backdrop, it will be interesting to see if Shopify can pick up momentum once again or whether more doldrums await when the company reports its Q1 earnings on May 5, For those fearing more pain, maybe one positive indicator can offer a glimmer of hope. Looking at website traffic trends, Unique Visitors (UVs) have increased sequentially by 32% - from 162.28 million to 213.94 million. Even better, the year-over-year growth is mightily impressive -- 160% uptick. Ahead of the print, RBC’s Paul Treiber believes Shopify’s gross merchandise volume “continued to grow faster than the industry,” and anticipated to increase by 22% y/y. As such, Treiber is calling for Q1 revenue of $1.24 billion, amounting to a 26% uptick vs. the same period last year. The figure is also in line with the consensus estimate. However, given the current shaky macro climate, Treiber says concerns around the “resiliency of consumer spending may weigh on 2H/CY22 growth expectations.” From an investment point of view, while Treiber warns that Shopify shares are “likely to remain volatile in the near-term,” he still fully gets behind this name. “We believe Shopify is one of the most compelling long-term growth stories in our coverage,” the 5-star analyst summed up. Therefore, Treiber rates SHOP shares an Outperform along with a $1,000 price target. The figure implies shares will be valued 125% higher in a year’s time. (To watch Treiber’s track record, click here) What does the rest of the Street think? Opinions are evenly split; the stock’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 14 Buys and Holds, each. However, practically all consider the shares undervalued right now; the $957.63 average target makes room for 12-month upside of 116%.

4/29/2022,"By Katie Paul, Dawn Chmielewski and Sheila Dang (Reuters) - To understand the speed with which Twitter's board accepted Elon Musk's $44 billion buyout offer, look no further than the dim view Wall Street holds over Twitter's ability to reach lofty financial goals announced after demands by activist investor Elliott Management in 2020. When Twitter reports quarterly financial results on Thursday, analysts expect user growth to lag behind what they need to reach aggressive 2023 growth targets that Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and then-chief executive of Twitter promised Wall Street. According to data from Refinitiv, Twitter is expected to miss this target and remain off track for the remainder of the year. Two weeks ahead of the deal announcement, Michael Nathanson, an influential tech and media analyst at MoffettNathanson, advised shareholders to ""take the money…and run."" Twitter's board reached the same conclusion. Directors lacked confidence in new CEO Parag Agrawal's ability to deliver a higher return than what Musk offered, clearing the way for the decision to sell just four days after the Tesla CEO detailed his financing, according to sources familiar with the board's deliberations. Handing off the CEO role to an untested leader, Agrawal, five months ago created additional risks for Twitter, said Ryan Jacob, chief investment officer at Jacob Asset Management, which holds $7.7 million worth of shares in Twitter. ""They have aggressive targets out there, and there's a lot of skepticism they can hit those numbers,"" Jacob said. ""The CEO doesn't have a record."" Eight current and former Twitter staffers, including both executives and employees, described to Reuters long-standing issues of internal dysfunction, indecision and a lack of accountability, which, in the view of one current employee, were exacerbated by the pressure to deliver promised results. After the deal to be taken private was announced on Monday, Dorsey thanked Musk and Agrawal in a tweet thread for ""getting the company out of an impossible situation,"" that he blamed on being ""owned by Wall Street and the ad model."" Twitter declined to comment. Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ANOTHER REORG Employees are bracing again for more change under Musk. Current and former employees told Reuters that Twitter's history of executive shake-ups since its founding in 2006 has made it difficult for the company to commit to long-term plans, often leaving projects dangling just as they start to bear fruit. Its last major reorganization was in December under the new CEO. Take the push into live sports, entertainment and news in 2016 aimed at capitalizing on Twitter's strength as a real-time platform. Twitter had signed high-profile deals with partners like the NFL to stream games and promoted the feature widely. Dorsey joined other executives at the Digital Content NewFronts in New York to tout the service's line-up to advertisers. A 2018 reorganization divided Twitter under 10 leaders overseeing aspects of the business like technology, product and revenue, which spread responsibility for projects like the live video push, a former executive and current employee told Reuters. Without a clear owner in the increasingly competitive space, and with hearings in Washington, D.C., new privacy rules in Europe and financial pressures vying for executives' attention, live video languished, they said. Lack of coordination at the top meant senior executives frequently pursued their own agendas without working together, four sources said. The problem was particularly acute among executives responsible for product, engineering, technology and revenue, known internally as the ""experience"" team, the sources said. Following Elliott's arrival, pressure to hit the 2023 growth targets exacerbated those issues, one current employee said, likening the environment to a ""pressure test."" Fleets, Twitter's short-lived Snapchat copycat product, was one example. Launched in late 2020, and championed by Agrawal and product director Kayvon Beykpour, the feature was mocked by Twitter users as a late attempt to jump on the disappearing messages bandwagon. The company assigned hundreds of engineers to work on building Fleets, but Agrawal and Beykpour failed to collaborate with counterparts responsible for revenue, and launched the feature without plans for incorporating ad space, said two people familiar with the project. ""It was a real mess, to be honest,"" said one former executive. ""It was the typical 'hey, just push it out there, we'll alter it later.'"" Twitter shelved Fleets eight months after its launch and only a month after introducing a limited ad rollout for the feature. HANDS-OFF MANAGEMENT Product and revenue mismatches may have been less frequent had Dorsey held those teams to account, but the chief executive embraced a management philosophy that led him to shy away from making specific decisions, four former Twitter executives told Reuters. One of these former executives said Dorsey's approach was inspired by Disney's former CEO, Bob Iger, who was known for hiring strong executives and encouraging them to take risks. ""One of the critiques around Jack is that sometimes he takes a long time to make decisions, he was reluctant to insert himself in decision-making,"" said the former executive. ""Jack views himself getting involved in a tie-breaking as a failure of leadership, because it means the management team hasn't solved it themselves."" Some thrived under this autonomy, particularly developers who were motivated to invent new things. But others said it left the company adrift. ""Everyone agrees that we need better accountability for decision-making at the management levels,"" a current employee said. On Monday, hours after the buyout announcement, employees at a company-wide meeting complained about Musk's ""questionable ethics"" and wondered what would happen to Twitter's work limiting hate speech on its platform. In response to a question about whether Donald Trump, the former U.S. president banned permanently from Twitter for risk of inciting violence, would return, executives admitted they were in the dark on the company's future. What is clear is Twitter will soon have a new leader with strong views on what to do with Twitter, whatever they may be.

4/29/2022,"Minimizing your expenses in retirement seems like a smart choice – especially if you can get rid of a large cost like your mortgage. Repaying your mortgage will not only ease your financial stress but may give you peace of mind knowing that the chances of becoming homeless if you run into financial troubles are less likely. But paying off your mortgage before retirement doesn’t make sense for everyone’s financial situation. So, when deciding if you should pay off your mortgage before you retire, here are some things to consider. Consider working with a financial advisor as you chart your course to a secure retirement. Use SmartAsset’s mortgage comparison tool to compare mortgage rates from top lenders and find the one that best suits your needs. Reasons to Pay off Your Mortgage Before You Retire Repaying your mortgage before retirement can make your monthly bills more manageable and potentially save you thousands of dollars in interest. Therefore, it might make sense to pay off your mortgage early if one or more of the following apply. Lower Your Monthly Expenses If you’re going to be on a fixed income in retirement, taking care of your mortgage in advance can help you lower your monthly bills. Since your mortgage likely takes up a substantial amount of money every month, you will be able to live on less once it’s gone. Reducing your bills will give you more financial stability in the future. Save Money on Interest Over the course of your loan payments, you will spend a significant amount of your interest. Sometimes interest payments may cost you tens of thousands of dollars. Accelerating your repayment allows you to free up this money towards something else. While you may no longer be able to deduct your mortgage interest from your taxes, the amount you save on interest might bring more advantages. Plus, as your interest payments decrease, the less you can claim on your taxes anyway. Don't miss out on news that could impact your finances.

Mortgage Rate Exceeds the Risk-Free Rate of Return Hypothetically, a risk-free rate of return is an investment’s rate of return that has zero risk involved. For example, a three-month U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill) rate of return is usually considered risk-free. That said, if your interest rate on your mortgage is higher than low risk investments like T-bills, repaying your mortgage is likely the better investment. Reasons Not to Pay off Your Mortgage Before You Retire On the other hand, sometimes, you need to tend to other financial priorities instead of putting your sole focus on your mortgage. With that said, it may not make sense to pay off your mortgage early if one or more of the following apply. High-Interest Debt Even if you repay your mortgage, you may risk your financial security if you enter into retirement with too much high-interest debt. So, make sure you prioritize your high-interest debt payments, especially non-deductible debt, like credit cards. Try to get in the habit of repaying your credit card balance every month. This way, when you retire, you won’t have to worry about acquiring a large chunk of credit card debt in your later years. Lack of a Financial Safety Net You don’t want to pour every dollar you have into your home and then have nothing left over to pay for other expenses that come up. Keeping a cash reserve of about three to six months of your expenses may give you an adequate cushion, so you don’t have to worry when you must shell out funds for an unexpected expense. As the saying goes, “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” Need to Boost Your Retirement Savings If you don’t have enough money set aside for retirement, you should probably shift your focus to boosting your nest egg. Retirement savings accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs let your money grow tax-free until you withdraw funds in retirement. Contributing to these savings vehicles is a great way to boost your retirement reserves. Also, many employers offer 401(k) match programs where they will match your contributions. They may either do this by matching up to a certain percentage of your contributions or matching up to a certain percentage of your salary. If you’re not capitalizing on your employer’s match program, you could be missing out on additional funds you can use in retirement. Greater Return With Another Investment Depending on your mortgage interest rate, it’s possible to yield a greater return with another investment. For example, U.S. stocks averaged a 9.2% return over 10 years, whereas the average rate for a 15-year loan is around 3%, according to Business Insider. Therefore, if you decide to invest in the stock market for a decade instead of paying off your mortgage early, you may come out on top. How to Pay off Your Mortgage Early If you discover repaying your mortgage early is the right choice, here are some tips for doing it. Make extra payments on your mortgage: A straightforward way to pay off your mortgage early is to make an extra payment every year over the length of your loan. Making one extra monthly payment once a year can shorten the length of your mortgage. You can also pay a little more than your monthly payment each month. This can save you thousands of dollars over the length of your loan. Just make sure to speak to your lender and have those extra payments go towards the principal. Make biweekly payments: Instead of remembering to make one extra payment each year or paying a little extra each month to pay down faster, you can make your payments biweekly. Typically, you make a mortgage payment monthly. Although, your lender may allow you the option to change your payments to biweekly instead. You would pay your entire monthly payment every other week. Some find paying a full payment every biweekly payday is better for them. Biweekly payments expedite your mortgage repayment, allowing you to pay it off faster. Refinance your mortgage to a shorter term: Refinancing your loan is a good way to get a lower interest rate. This will get you on the right road to paying off your mortgage earlier. One thing to remember, if you have a shorter length of time to pay off your loan, even with your interest rate at a lower point, your monthly payments will be more significant. Bottom Line Repaying your mortgage before you retire requires special consideration, even if you are only repaying it a few years early. For some, paying off their mortgage before retirement is the right financial move to make. For example, if you plan to stay in your home into retire, it may make sense for you. But, ultimately, you should base your decision on your financial situation. Also, ask your lender if there is a prepayment penalty. Usually, lenders only apply a prepayment penalty within the first five years of your mortgage. However, be sure to check ahead of time. Tips on Mortgages A financial advisor can help you develop plans to accomplish all of your financial goals. This includes paying off your home before retirement. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

We ran the tickers through the TipRanks database to get a feel for what the Street has in mind for these names; turns out both are rated as Strong Buys. Let’s take a closer look. Ardmore Shipping (ASC) In business since 2010, Ardmore is a shipping company providing voyage charters, time charters, and commercial pool vessels. The company’s fleet of 25 product and chemical tankers averages only 6 years of age, making it one of the industry’s most modern. In keeping with its commitment to maintaining a modern fleet, in early April Ardmore announced the sale of three vessels – all built in 2008, and so well over the fleet’s average age – to Leonhardt & Blumberg. The sale, for $40 million, will net Ardmore some $15 million in cash proceeds. Ardmore focuses on the transport of petroleum products and other chemicals to customers worldwide. Its tanker fleet ranges from 25,000 to 50,000 deadweight tonnes, and its relatively young age makes it more fuel-efficient than is commonly found in the industry, an advantage for Ardmore at a time of rising fuel prices. Year-to-date, shares in ASC are up 83%. The company has managed this even though quarterly revenues have not yet returned to pre-COVID levels. In the most recent quarter reported, 4Q21, Ardmore had $52.5 million at the top line. This was up 25% year-over-year, but was still down 13% from the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic. The company ran a quarterly net loss of 25 cents, in line with expectations and a 35% improvement from the year-ago quarter. Ardmore finished 2021 with $67 million in available liquid assets, a total that included $55.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as $11.6 million in undrawn credit. Covering this stock for H.C. Wainwright, shipping industry expert Magnus Fyhr takes an upbeat stance. He notes that the company’s shares are rising, and writes, “Despite the appreciation, we believe ASC is attractively valued trading at a 40% discount to our estimated NAV compared to an 18% discount for the tanker peer group. In addition, with the product tanker market recovery gaining momentum, we believe the risk/reward remains attractive. Furthermore, with a high-quality fleet, we believe Ardmore is well positioned to capitalize on stricter environmental regulations as older tonnage is marginalized.” In line with these comments, Fyhr rates ASC a Buy along with an $8.50 price target. Additional gains of ~36% could be heading investors’ way should the target be met over the next 12 months. (To watch Fyhr’s track record, click here) Small-cap shippers like Ardmore don’t always get the attention they may deserve – but all three of the analyst reviews here are positive, making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. ASC shares are priced at $6.24 and their average target of $7.50 implies a one-year upside of ~20%. (See ASC stock forecast on TipRanks) International Seaways (INSW) Next up is International Seaways, another small-cap shipper – but a step up in size, as International boasts a market cap of $1.1 billion. International owns and/or operates a fleet of 88 vessels, ranging in size from 36,000 deadweight tonne (DWT) handymax tankers to giant 300,000+ DWT very large crude carriers (VLCCs) and to two even bigger 432,000 DWT floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessels. The company focuses its operations on the carriage of crude oil and petroleum products on the global sea lanes. Compared to pre-pandemic levels – that is, to 2019, before the supply chain and trade disruptions began – International’s revenues remain depressed. However, they are rebounding from the lows hit during the COVID crisis, and registered sequential quarterly gains in 2H21. The company finished last year with a 4Q top line of $93 million, up an impressive 75% year-over-year. For 2021 as a whole, International posted revenues of $255.9 million. While this was down 36% y/y, it’s important to note that the company’s revenues bottomed out in 1Q21, and have been trending up since then. In another point of importance for investors, International has realized some $25 million in cost synergies in the first few months of 2022, related to the company’s merger last year with Diamond Shipping. That merger made International one of the largest diversified tanker companies to be listed on the US markets. All of this has caught the eye of Stifel’s 5-star analyst Benjamin Nolan, who described International Seaways as one of his ‘favorite names’ in tankers. Getting into details, Nolan writes, “While the tanker market has been weak, oil demand is recovering. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has pushed short term tanker rates materially higher, but longer term in the absence of price related oil demand destruction, we expect market conditions should improve significantly. With a large fleet benefiting from cost synergies and great fleet float, a strong balance sheet, and with shares trading at 82% of NAV, we expect there to be continued upside as the tanker market recovers…” Based on all of the above factors, Nolan rates INSW shares a Buy along with a $13 price target. Therefore, the analyst expects the stock to change hands for ~21% premium over the next 12 months. This is on top of the 53% growth the stock has seen this year. (To watch Nolan’s track record, click here) Nolan is bullish here, but the 4 unanimously positive reviews on record show that the Street agrees with this stance. INSW's shares are trading for $22.28 and their $27.50 average price target suggests ~23% upside this year.

4/29/2022,"April 27 (Reuters) - The average interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan rose to its highest level since June 2009 last week and demand for mortgages ebbed as the impact of rising costs began to bite, Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) data showed on Wednesday. The average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 5.37% in the week ended April 22 from 5.20% a week earlier, the MBA survey showed. It has risen 220 basis points from 12 months ago, with most of the rise since the turn of the year as financial markets have reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates more swiftly to combat high inflation. The central bank is expected to lift its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points at its policy meeting next week, and to decide to start cutting its portfolio of $8.5 trillion of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities - a stash of assets that had helped keep consumer borrowing costs, for mortgages in particular, low throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The housing market continues to give mixed signals, mostly because of near record low supply. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index survey on Tuesday showed the number of consumers planning to buy a house climbed, despite soaring mortgage rates and record house prices. The median existing house price jumped 15% from a year earlier to an all-time high of $375,300 in March, the National Association of Realtors reported last week. Still, mortgage applications declined last week for the second week in a row. The MBA said its Purchase Composite Index, a measure of all mortgage loan applications for purchase of a single family home, fell 7.6% on a seasonally adjusted basis, while the refinance index fell 9%.

4/29/2022,"By Florence Tan and Sabrina Valle (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday its Russian unit Exxon Neftegas Ltd has declared force majeure for its Sakhalin-1 operations due to sanctions on Russia that have made it increasingly difficult to ship crude to customers. The Sakhalin-1 project produces Sokol crude oil off the coast of Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East, exporting about 273,000 barrels per day, mainly to South Korea, and to other destinations including Japan, Australia, Thailand and the United States. Exxon said on March 1 it would exit about $4 billion in assets and discontinue all its Russia operations, including Sakhalin 1, following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The oil producer is taking steps to exit Sakhalin 1, which includes addressing contractual and commercial obligations, Exxon spokesperson Julie King said in a written response. ""As operator of Sakhalin-1, we have an obligation to ensure the safety of people, protection of the environment and integrity of operations,"" King said. Exxon has also significantly phased down its chemical and lubricant businesses in Russia, and suspended sales of all chemical and lubricant products into Russia and Belarus. Project stakeholders, which also include Japan's Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development consortium and Indian explorer ONGC Videsh, are having difficulty chartering tankers to ship oil out of a region that generally needs ice vessels to navigate the journey. That is because of growing concerns from shippers over reputation risk and the increasing difficulty for Russian assets to find insurance coverage. ""As a result, Exxon Neftegas Ltd has curtailed crude oil production,"" King said. The latest tanker to take on crude at Russia's De Kastri port - where oil from Sakhalin-1 is loaded - was Aframax tanker Captain Kostichev, according to data on Refinitiv Eikon. The vessel is currently located off De Kastri port. Two other Aframax tankers, Victor Konetsky and Yuri Senkevich, often used to ship Sokol crude to Yeosu, are empty and floating near the port as well. Japan's Sakhalin consortium, which owns a 30% stake in the project, declined comment, citing confidentiality agreements with Exxon.

4/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Teladoc Health Inc., a telemedicine company that is one of Cathie Wood’s biggest investments, lost almost half its value Thursday after slashing its forecast on cost inflation and a slowdown in sales. Most Read from Bloomberg Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Putin Is Losing So Here’s How He’ll Make the War Worse U.S. Economy Posts Surprise Contraction, Belying Solid Consumer Picture A Powerful Dynasty Bankrupted Sri Lanka in Just 30 Months Stocks Surge Before Amazon Casts Shadow Over Rally: Markets Wrap The shares tumbled 40%, the biggest single day selloff since the company went public in 2015. Teladoc, a former stay-at-home winner, extended a slump that’s wiped out nearly 90% of its value since a record high set in February 2021. Investors had been looking for a bigger payoff as the pandemic drove a pickup in virtual doctor visits, but increased competition, including from insurers, has cut into telemedicine profits. Teladoc’s results are dragging on other stocks in the digital health arena including rival American Well Corp. and health software company Accolade Inc. Amwell fell 8.5%, while Accolade closed down 9.9% at a record low, before sinking more than 20% in postmarket trading after reporting earnings. Wood’s ARK Investment Management LLC is Teladoc’s largest shareholder, with a 12% stake worth about $652 million, well below Wednesday’s $1.1 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg data. Teladoc, the third-largest holding in the ARK Innovation ETF, adds to the woes at Wood’s flagship fund, which hit a two-year low this week. Wood’s funds added to their positions in Teladoc on Monday and Tuesday ahead of the telemedicine provider’s report. The company is part of a group of former pandemic winners backed by Wood. Others including Zoom Video Communications Inc. have been hit by the ending of covid lockdowns and concerns around rising interest rates that have weighed on growth stocks. Results for the Purchase, N.Y.-based Teladoc were hurt by higher advertising expenses in the mental health market, as well as an “elongated sales cycle” in chronic conditions as employers and providers of healthcare plans evaluate strategies, Chief Executive Jason Gorevic said in a statement. Teladoc also took a $6.6 billion charge for impairment of goodwill, a non-cash charge the company excluded from its adjusted results. Most of the goodwill on Teladoc’s balance sheet followed its $12.9 billion acquisition of diabetes management company Livongo Health in 2020. The deal, which followed a run-up in Livongo’s stock price, valued the company at about 56 times revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. While the company has “the most robust virtual health platform, it is clear that competitive intensity has increased significantly and, in our view, is unlikely to abate any time soon,” Citigroup Inc. analyst Daniel Grosslight said in a research note. He slashed his price target for the stock to $43 from $115. With the stock’s forward-looking sales multiple now at an all-time low, it is ripe for managed care, big tech or other telemedicine companies to consider an acquisition, Grosslight said. At least six analysts downgraded the stock after the report and Teladoc now has 19 neutral and 11 buy-equivalent ratings, though the shares still have no sell recommendations among firms tracked by Bloomberg.

4/29/2022,"The Euro has broken down below the 1.05 level during trading on Thursday, an area that quite frankly I thought would hold a little bit better than it did. Because of this, the market is likely to continue seeing a lot of negativity, and at this point, I think that any bounce that occurs will more likely than not offer a selling opportunity. In fact, that is exactly how I am going to approach his market until we clear the 1.08 level at the very least. The 50 Day EMA is racing towards that level, so I do think that it probably continues to offer a bit of dynamic resistance if and when we finally get there. Underneath, the Euro could find itself racing toward parity, but I do not think we get there easily. This pair typically is very choppy, and then will have a sudden burst as we have just seen. Because of this, I would expect some type of bounce but at the first signs of exhaustion I would also anticipate that a lot of money comes flying into the market to take advantage of “cheap US dollars.” All of this being said, you can clearly see that the market has been selling off so drastically that a bounce would make quite a bit of sense because quite frankly markets cannot go in the same direction forever. Because of this, I do think that we will more than likely try to defend the 1.05 level. On the upside, we would more likely than not find resistance at the 1.07 level, and multiple other places above there.

4/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Sanctioned billionaire Oleg Tinkov sold his family’s stake in the digital bank he founded to Russia’s richest man, Vladimir Potanin, just over a week after he slammed President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Putin Is Losing So Here’s How He’ll Make the War Worse U.S. Economy Posts Surprise Contraction, Belying Solid Consumer Picture A Powerful Dynasty Bankrupted Sri Lanka in Just 30 Months Stocks Surge Before Amazon Casts Shadow Over Rally: Markets Wrap Potanin’s Interros Capital is buying Tinkov’s 35% stake in TCS Group Holding Plc, better known as Tinkoff Bank, Interros said in a statement Thursday. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Tinkov, worth $3.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, was sanctioned by the U.K. in March and accused of being complicit in Russia’s war of Ukraine. Last week, he published an expletive-filled post about Russia’s “insane war” on his Instagram page in a rare example of a prominent Russian businessman publicly criticizing the invasion. After the comments, Tinkoff’s co-chief executive officers quit and the bank distanced itself from its founder, calling him just one of its 20 million clients and announcing plans to drop his name from the brand. Tinkov said he was retiring to focus on his health and family, according to the statement. In 2020, he announced he was receiving treatment for leukemia. That same year, he pulled out of a deal to sell the bank to Russian internet giant Yandex NV in a deal that would have valued TCS at $5.5 billion. The stake is Potanin’s second bank acquisition in April, after Interros bought Rosbank PJSC from Societe Generale SA, which sought to pull out of Russia after the Ukraine invasion. Unlike many of Russia’s richest people, Potanin has not been targeted by U.S., U.K. or European Union sanctions, though he was recently hit by Canada.

4/29/2022,"Twitter (TWTR) reported earnings Thursday that missed revenue expectations, but posted better than expected user growth, in its first report since announcing plans to sell to Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk for $44 billion. The company also called off its prior guidance due to the sale. ""Given the pending acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, we will not be providing any forward looking guidance and are withdrawing all previously provided goals and outlook,"" the company said. Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what Wall Street was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue: $1.20 billion versus $1.23 billion expected Adjusted EPS: $0.90 per share Active users: 229 million versus 226 million expected Twitter shares were flat following the announcement. The report comes at perhaps the most consequential period of Twitter's existence. In early April, Musk revealed that he took a 9.2% stake in Twitter and was set to join the company's board. But the mercurial CEO rebuffed the plan and began tweeting jokes about the firm. Fearing a hostile takeover, Twitter's board planned to adopt a poison pill that would have allowed shareholders to purchase shares of the company at a steep discount in an effort to minimize Musk's sway over the microblogging site. Musk, however, took a different route and filed a form with the Securities and Exchange Commission laying out his intent to purchase Twitter. Soon after, the board agree to sell the company to Musk for $54.20 per share. Since then Musk has said he plans to ease content moderation on the platform raising fears that it will be inundated with hate speech and disinformation. Musk has also tweeted critical remarks about Twitter and its moderation decisions. He's also continued to regularly tweet memes along with his signature brand of edgy content including one tweet in which he said he planned to buy Coke next and add cocaine back into the recipe. Coke's original early formula included traces amounts of a precursor to cocaine, according to Snopes. On Monday, fellow billionaire and space industry rival Jeff Bezos inserted himself into the conversation questioning whether Musk's reliance on China as Tesla's second largest market could give that country's government leverage to force Musk to remove content that criticizes the regime from Twitter.

4/29/2022,"Inflation surged 8.5% for the year through March, the fastest pace since December 1981. And last month, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rates for the first time since 2018. But with most savings accounts still paying less than 0.7% annually, things remain challenging for investors looking to earn a passive income. The good news? Even in the current interest rate environment, you can find companies paying generous dividends to investors. Rock-solid dividend stocks can help investors diversify their growth-oriented portfolios. At the same time, they offer a reliable income stream so investors don’t have to time the market to make money in stocks. Here’s a look at three dividend stocks that could be an opportunity for income investors for the rest of 2022. At a time when many brick-and-mortar retailers remain in the doldrums, powerhouse Walmart stands out. The company runs a massive retail business with approximately 10,500 stores under 46 banners in 24 countries. Thanks to its “Everyday Low Prices,” Walmart attracts around 230 million customers to its stores and websites every week. Walmart has thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the three months ended Jan. 31, 2022, revenue grew 0.5% year over year to $152.9 billion. Notably, comparable-store sales — a key measure of a retailer’s health — at Walmart U.S. rose 5.6%. The company has also capitalized on the e-commerce boom, which is often considered a threat to physical retailers. Compared to two years ago, Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales grew 70%. The retail giant started paying dividends in 1974 and has increased its payout every year since. With a quarterly dividend rate of 56 cents per share, Walmart offers an annual yield of 1.6%. When you make payments to a company every month, wouldn’t it be nice to get some cash back from it? Well, investors can do that with Verizon — one of the largest telecommunication companies in the U.S. that also happens to be paying generous and reliable dividends. Millions and millions of people pay Verizon every month to use the company’s service. Its 4G LTE network covers 99% of the American population, and more than 230 million people are already covered by its 5G network. Verizon has been raising its payout annually and currently offers an annual dividend yield of 5% — a very generous amount in today’s market. Business is growing, too. The company’s wireless segment had 1.06 million retail postpaid net additions in Q4 of 2021. Operating revenue totaled $34.1 billion, up 4.8% year-over-year after adjusting for the sale of Verizon Media. Despite Verizon’s solid business and rising dividend payouts, its shares have slipped 11% over the past 12 months. With most of the market looking expensive by historical standards, Verizon could give contrarian investors something to think about. If Verizon’s 5% yield still isn’t juicy enough for you, check out Ellington Financial. Headquartered in Old Greenwich, Conn., Ellington Financial has a portfolio of financial assets that provide it with a predictable income stream. It then passes those profits to shareholders through monthly dividends. The company’s investments include residential and commercial mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and consumers loans among others. While Ellington isn’t a widely followed financial play, it stands out in today’s market due to the sheer size of its payout. With a monthly dividend rate of 15 cents per share and a current stock price of $17.75, the company offers a staggering annual yield of 10.1%. In Q4 of 2021, Ellington Financial generated core earnings of $24.9 million, or 44 cents per share. Its book value per share at the end of December was $18.39.

4/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Amgen Inc. fell the most in a year after the company disclosed that it is facing a potential tax bill of at least $7.1 billion from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Most Read from Bloomberg Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Putin Is Losing So Here’s How He’ll Make the War Worse U.S. Economy Posts Surprise Contraction, Belying Solid Consumer Picture A Powerful Dynasty Bankrupted Sri Lanka in Just 30 Months Stocks Surge Before Amazon Casts Shadow Over Rally: Markets Wrap The IRS is seeking $5.1 billion in back taxes related to how profit was allocated between Amgen’s entities in Puerto Rico and in the mainland U.S. for the years 2013 to 2015, in addition to about $2 billion in penalties. The drugmaker disclosed the news with its first-quarter results on Wednesday, and it largely overshadowed better-than-expected revenue and earnings. Many pharmaceutical companies have operations in Puerto Rico, where profits are taxed at a lower rate. Amgen has been in a spat with the IRS for more than a year over this issue, and the company had already disclosed that the agency is seeking $3.6 billion in back taxes for the years 2010 through 2012. Amgen wants to consolidate the two cases in tax court and said the dispute will likely take several years to resolve. Yaron Werber, a senior biotechnology analyst at Cowen Inc., said the timing of the IRS actions is “bizarre” since Amgen’s Puerto Rico operations are well known and have been a part of its business for a long time. Amgen has contested the 2010 to 2012 issue in U.S. tax court and plans to file a petition disputing the most recent action. Chief Financial Officer Peter Griffith told analysts on a conference call that the company is “very confident” in its tax reserves. Werber said the tax issue isn’t a grave concern for investors. “There’s also an assumption that what the U.S. government is starting with is sort of the worst-case scenario, subject to negotiation and litigation, and at the end, it’s going to be a much more appetizing resolution,” he said.

4/29/2022,"Ostin Technology, a low-key technology company, made an electrifying debut as the first Chinese stock offering in the US since February, underlining strong appetite even as regulatory officials remained at odds over audit and delisting issues. The supplier of display modules and polarisers soared 892 per cent on Nasdaq to US$39.66 on Wednesday, giving it market value of US$535.4 million. The company raised US$13.5 million in gross proceeds by selling 3.38 million shares at US$4 each. Ostin's factories in Nanjing, a mainland city in eastern Jiangsu province, produce display parts used in consumer electronics, outdoor LCD displays, and automotive panel displays.

The first Chinese IPO since Meihua International Medical Technologies' listing in mid-February shows Chinese firms are still eager to tap the world's biggest capital market, as China voiced support for such fundraising. Fears of mass delisting of US-listed Chinese stocks, with an estimated US$1.3 trillion of market capitalisation, have fanned an exodus to Hong Kong and weighed on local equity markets. A worked in an Ostin Technology facility. Photo: Handout alt=A worked in an Ostin Technology facility. Photo: Handout> The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) this month said a series of weekly bilateral discussions among regulators on the auditing hurdles have progressed smoothly. Its vice-chairman Fang Xinghai said he is confident that the uncertainty will be addressed soon, according to Chinese media. Beijing has shown willingness to make changes, as the CSRC on April 2 withdrew a requirement that only Chinese regulators conduct on-site audit inspections of Chinese companies listed overseas. China denies access to the US's Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), citing state secret concerns among others. The new rules also require listed companies and their accountants to decide what is sensitive information and what cannot be handed over to US regulators. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), enacted during the twilight of Donald Trump's administration, requires US-listed foreign companies to comply with audit inspection under the PCAOB rules, or face expulsion from US exchanges after three consecutive years of non-compliance. So far the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has identified companies including Baidu, Futu Holdings, iQiyi, Hutchmed, Yum China Holdings, Zai Lab, BeiGene, and ACM Research as Chinese companies liable to the law. The SEC has said it will identify a total of 270 liable companies globally. Despite Ostin's auspicious debut and positive signs in the discussions between the US and China, companies will remain cautious about listings in the US, according to Gary Ching, Hong Kong-based chief analyst for macroeconomic and strategy at Guosen Securities. ""The first-day performance of an individual stock depends on its fundamentals and technical aspects, but its relation to the big picture outlook is limited,"" he said. ""It is likely to enhance investor confidence if this stock continues to rise, say for a week."" However, Chinese corporations will not be encouraged to increase their listings in the US until more solid results from the negotiations between Chinese and US regulators are announced. ""Chinese companies will prefer a listing in the mainland in the short term, or in Hong Kong if they want to attract offshore investors,"" Ching added.

4/29/2022,"(Adds adjusted profit, segment revenue) April 28 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below Wall Street expectations on Thursday on worries of demand weakness in its largest end market, PCs, and increased supply-chain uncertainty due to COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Shares of the company fell 5% in after-market trading. Rising inflation, resurgence of COVID-19 in China and uncertainties around the war in Ukraine have shifted consumer spending away from gadgets, hurting Intel, which saw more than half of its revenue last year coming from the segment selling processors for PCs. Analysts say the PC market is coming off of searing rates of growth over the last two years as remote working and learning triggered high demand during the pandemic. As lockdowns in China continue, supply-chain bottlenecks are likely to hurt Intel's customers, in turn affecting the chipmaker's business. The company expects current-quarter adjusted profit of 70 cents per share on revenue of about $18 billion, below analysts' average estimate of 83 cents per share on $18.38 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Intel is also facing increasing competition in the data center space, as peers Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices are ramping up their chip production to cater to the booming market amid growth in the metaverse, AI applications and cloud computing. Revenue from Intel's higher-margin data center and AI business rose 22% to $6 billion in the reported quarter, while analysts on average had expected $6.77 billion. However, adjusted revenue for the first quarter was $18.4 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $18.31 billion. On an adjusted basis, Intel earned 87 cents per share, above expectations of 81 cents.

4/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s major gas bank rejected a payment from a trading firm that Germany seized from Moscow’s control, the first sign of friction following the take-over amid a broader regional energy dispute. Most Read from Bloomberg Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Russia to Cut Gas to Poland and Bulgaria, Making Energy a Weapon Russia to Cut Gas to Poland, Bulgaria Until Pay Demands Met Amazon’s Twitch Seeks to Revamp Creator Pay With Focus on Profit Ukraine Latest: Russia Says It Cut Gas Flows to Poland, Bulgaria Gazprombank declined payment for some April and May gas deliveries to Germany and Austria under contract with Gazprom Marketing & Trading Ltd., even as the company sought to pay for the fuel using a rubles account as Russia has demanded, according to people familiar with the matter. GM&T was previously under the direction of Russian-state gas producer Gazprom PJSC’s German subsidiary. Germany took over the unit earlier this month to secure the country’s gas supplies, and it now risks being shunned under its new ownership. Also See: Germany Seizes Control of Gazprom Unit to Secure Gas Supply The European Union and Russia have been in a standoff over gas supplies, with President Vladimir Putin demanding payment in rubles. Under the decree, buyers would set up two accounts with Gazprombank, which would then convert euro payments in one account to rubles in the other. The EU has suggested that payment can still be made in euros, or else buyers risk running afoul of sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. Russia, the bloc’s top supplier, on Wednesday cut shipments to Poland and Bulgaria over the payment dispute. While the GM&T case deals with a very small amount of gas -- a fraction of a percent of Europe’s total imports from Russia -- it highlights complications with the Kremlin’s payment order. Unclear Process The case involves a payment process that is “unclear,” Germany’s energy regulator said in a statement. The gas is due to be paid for in euros as agreed in the contract, it said, adding that GM&T can replace the gas by buying on the open market if it needs to. GM&T, which is based in London, procures gas for business retail arms in Germany and the U.K. Its rejected payment to Gazprombank is part of a medium-term contract to supply 7 terawatt-hours of gas by the end of 2023, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Read More: Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia The trading firm, which is one of many importers of gas to Germany, is still trying to ensure the transaction is processed and is in negotiations with Gazprombank and Gazprom’s export arm, the people said. If the gas isn’t delivered, it could further tighten European gas supplies. If GM&T is not able to source the gas from Russia, the trading firm may have to source it elsewhere at higher rate.

4/29/2022,"It seems like a tricky time to get into real estate. On one hand, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates multiple times this year. Higher rates imply bigger mortgage payments — and that could hurt the real estate market. On the other hand, consumer prices are rising at their fastest pace in 40 years. People are looking to preserve their purchasing power. And real estate is one of the most effective inflation-fighting assets. As inflation rises, the cost of raw materials and labor needed to build a house goes up. And that’s one reason why you almost always see real estate prices rise during high inflation periods. Well-chosen properties can provide more than just price appreciation. Investors also get to earn a steady stream of rental income. But while we all like the idea of collecting passive income, being a landlord does come with its hassles: mowing lawns, fixing leaky faucets, and dealing with difficult tenants, among other headaches. These days, however, you have a variety of options to invest in real estate without becoming a landlord. REITs stands for real estate investment trusts, which are companies that own income-producing real estate like apartment buildings, shopping centers and office towers. You can think of a REIT as a giant landlord: It owns a large number of properties, collects rent from tenants, and passes that rent to shareholders in the form of regular dividend payments. To qualify as a REIT, a company must pay out at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends each year. In exchange, REITs pay little to no income tax at the corporate level. Of course, REITs can still experience rough times. During the pandemic-induced recession in early 2020, several REITs cut back on their dividends. Their share prices also tumbled in the market sell-off. Some REITs, on the other hand, manage to dish out reliable dividends through thick and thin. Realty Income, for instance, pays monthly dividends and has delivered 115 dividend increases since it went public in 1994. It’s easy to invest in REITs because they’re publicly traded. Unlike buying a house — where transactions can take weeks and even months to close — you can buy or sell shares in a REIT anytime you want throughout the trading day. That makes REITs one of the most liquid real estate investment options available. Also, your investment can be as little or as large as you want — be it $100 or $100,000. While buying a house usually requires a hefty down payment and a mortgage, you can buy shares in a REIT with as much money as you are willing to spend. While REITs aren’t known as the hottest stocks in the stock market, some have delivered some eye-catching returns: In 2021, the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index — which tracks publicly-traded REITs in the U.S. — rose 41.3%, topping the S&P 500’s already impressive 28.7% gain. The sector is also seeing increased consolidation. Last year, mergers and acquisitions among REITs totaled an all-time high of $140 billion. In February, Blackstone announced that it would acquire rental apartment owner Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS) in an all-cash transaction valued at $5.8 billion. If big asset managers are making significant moves into the space, retail investors might want to pay attention. Crowdfunding has become a buzzword in recent years. It refers to the practice of funding a project by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people. These days, many crowdfunding investing platforms allow you to own a percentage of physical real estate — from rental properties to commercial buildings to parcels of land. Their popularity has been growing wildly because they cater to different types of investors with various budgets. Some options are targeted at accredited investors, and some platforms allow them to participate in individual deals with minimum investments that reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. To be an accredited investor, you need to have a net worth of over $1 million or an earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the past two years. If you are not an accredited investor, there are many options that let you invest small sums if you like — even $100. Such platforms make real estate investing more accessible to the general public by simplifying the process and lowering the barrier to entry. Rather than putting tens of thousands of dollars toward the down payment for a house you want to rent out, you can invest the sum of your choice to buy shares in properties. Some crowdfunding platforms also pool money from investors to fund development projects. These deals typically require longer commitments from investors and offer a different set of risk-reward profiles compared to buying shares in established income-producing rental properties. For instance, the development could get delayed and you won’t earn rental income in your expected time frame. Sponsors of crowdfunded real estate deals usually charge fees to investors — typically in the range of 0.5% to 2.5% of whatever you’ve invested. Picking the right REIT or crowdfunded deal requires plenty of due diligence on your part. If you are looking for an easier, more diversified way to invest in real estate, consider exchange-traded funds. You can think of an ETF as a portfolio of stocks. And as the name suggests, ETFs trade on major exchanges, making them convenient to buy and sell. Investors use ETFs to gain access to a diversified portfolio. You don’t need to worry about which stocks to buy and sell. Some ETFs passively track an index, while others are actively managed. They all charge a fee — referred to as the management expense ratio — in exchange for managing the fund. The Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ), for example, provides investors with broad exposure to U.S. REITs. The fund holds 166 stocks and has total net assets of $81.8 billion. Over the past 10 years, VNQ has delivered an average annual return of 9.6%. Its management expense ratio is 0.12%. You can also check out the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE), which aims to replicate the real estate sector of the S&P 500 Index. It currently has 29 holdings and has an expense ratio of 0.10%. Since the fund’s inception in October 2015, it has delivered an average annual return of 10.6%. Investing in real estate isn’t risk-free — far from it. While owning real estate can help you keep up with inflation and earn a passive income, property prices don’t always go up. Tenants could also have trouble paying rent, so the income stream that landlords rely on can be especially lumpy. That said, real estate has historically been one of the most reliable ways to build wealth — particularly during times of hot inflation. And today, investment vehicles like REITs, crowdfunding companies and ETFs make owning real estate even easier. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

4/29/2022,"Robinhood (HOOD) shares slid in after-hours after the online brokerage app missed on the top and bottom lines for the first quarter and dropped its revenue guidance in exchange for monthly metrics reports. These are the company's results for the first three months of the year, versus expectations by Wall Street analysts. Adjusted earnings (loss) per share: -45c reported vs - 36c expected Revenue: $299 million reported vs $352.93 million expected Monthly Active Users (MAU) decreased 10% to 15.9 million for March 2022, compared with 17.7 million for March 2021 during which the trading app saw high trading volumes and account sign-ups. ""We're seeing our customers affected by the macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our results this quarter,"" said Jason Warnick, Chief Financial Officer of Robinhood Markets said in the company's earnings release. ""At the same time, we've also made progress on our long-term plans and continue to pursue them aggressively."" The company's revenue for the first three months of this year of $299 million, is a significant decline compared to $522 million in the first quarter of 2021. The height of the 'meme' frenzy involving GameStop (GME) occurred during the first three months of last year. Going forward, Robinhood says it no longer intends to provide revenue guidance. Instead, it will start reporting ""certain limited purpose statistical and operational results on a monthly basis"", according to its earnings release. The company had already missed revenue estimates in the third and fourth quarter of last year, in part due to lower trading activity. Crypto activity started declining after seeing record highs in the second quarter of 2021. Seasonal headwinds also contributed to fewer new funded accounts in the second half of last year. The zero-commission-per-trade industry has become increasingly competitive. In response, Robinhood is laser focused on its new Wallets program. The Menlo Park, California-based company recently announced it was laying off 9% of fits full-time workforce after a hiring spree in 2021. ""They went public at the most craziest, exuberant time for trading,"" Mizuho senior financial technology analyst Dan Dolev told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday. ""They definitely over-hired. They need to trim their employees,"" said Dolev. ""It's very harsh but it doesn't say anything about the fundamental value proposition of the business."" Dolev currently has a Buy rating on the stock, with a $19 price target. Robinhood's stock has been touching new 52-week lows recently. The stock has 7 Buy, 8 Hold, and 3 Sell recommendations from Wall Street analysts. Robinhood went public last July, pricing its IPO price at $38/share.

4/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer met to discuss possible legislation to reduce gasoline prices, according to a Democratic aide, as inflation poses an increasing political threat ahead of the midterm election. Most Read from Bloomberg Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Russia to Cut Gas to Poland and Bulgaria, Making Energy a Weapon Amazon’s Twitch Seeks to Revamp Creator Pay With Focus on Profit Russia to Cut Gas to Poland, Bulgaria Until Pay Demands Met Hwang’s Spectacular Collapse Culminates in Criminal Charges Leaders are hoping to pass legislation dealing with gas prices before the end of May but would need Republican cooperation in the Senate to do so. The GOP is pushing for expanded fossil fuel production domestically, something progressive Democrats may be unable to support. Rising prices are a top concern for many voters, and Democrats already face a tough road to holding on to control of the House and Senate in the November election. The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, out Friday, is estimated to have risen 6.7% in March from a year earlier. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is $4.134, up from $2.885 a year ago, according to AAA. Schumer this week has been talking about moving a bill that would beef up the Federal Trade Commission‘s ability to stop gas price manipulation. “There is something deeply wrong, deeply wrong, about seeing the largest oil and gas companies in the world drench top executives and wealthy shareholders with cash while Americans are struggling at the pump,” Schumer said Monday on the Senate floor. “Democrats are also discussing – and will consider – other potential action to beef up the FTC’s ability to crack down on price gouging in industries, including the oil industry. We will have more to say on this as the week progresses,” he said. The American Petroleum Institute said the proposed FTC bill is without merit because price gouging is not driving up prices at the pump. “This is an industry of price takers, not price makers, and repeated in-depth investigations by the FTC have shown that changes in gasoline prices are based on market factors and not due to illegal behavior,” said API senior Vice President of Policy, Economics and Regulatory Affairs Frank Macchiarola, API senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs, said. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that the House hopes to vote on a gasoline price bill in the coming weeks. A gas-tax holiday is on the table as well as other elements to address supply chain issues, he said. A House panel earlier this month held a hearing to excoriate executives of six oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP America Inc., accusing them of exploiting the war in Ukraine and a surge in crude prices to reap windfall profits at the expense of American motorists.
