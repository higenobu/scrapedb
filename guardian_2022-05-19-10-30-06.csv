5/19/2022,"Hailed as Australia’s “right-handed version of Rafael Nadal” before injuries derailed his career, Jason Kubler has fought back from match point down to move just one match away from making it into the main draw of the French Open for the first time. Turning 29-years-old on match day, the former junior world number one Kubler dug deep to come back from the brink of defeat and savour one of his biggest wins over the experienced Moldovan Radu Albot in the second round of qualifying. When he first burst onto the scene with his powerful build and strong forehand, Kubler was often likened to the powerful champion Nadal. Born in the north Brisbane suburb of Mango Hill to a Filipino mother, Kubler’s passion for tennis came from his Australian father John whom he lost to cancer when he was eight-years-old. Kubler channelled his grief into the game the father and son had loved. In 2009 he became just the second player in history (alongside Rafael Nadal) to go undefeated through the World Youth Cup and Junior Davis Cup. When Kubler went on to win five junior titles in a row, he was inevitably hailed as “Australian tennis’s next big thing.” But injuries bedevilled his rise to the top and Kubler has been forced to battle on the Challenger circuit outside the top 100 for the best part of a decade as a generation next led by Nick Kyrgios and Alex De Minaur seemingly passed him by. However, Kubler has enjoyed a renaissance in this 2022 season. It began when he reached the Australian Open mixed doubles final with Jaimee Fourlis and continued on the clay courts as he fought his way back via lower-ranked tournaments. After once falling outside the world top 1000, Kubler’s ranking has now surged to 161 after also winning a couple of minor ITF events in Canberra on clay earlier this year. Yet Kubler looked to be heading for the exits in his fourth attempt at French Open qualifying. He was match point down at 5-6, staring at a straight sets defeat, before clawing his back to earn a memorable 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (10-4) win after more than three and a quarter hours, dominating the first-to-10-points super tiebreak (introduced to conclude all matches which are locked at 6-6 in a final set) to claim a famous victory. The gutsy Queenslander must now fancy his chances of beating Portugal’s Pedro Sousa, who’s ranked No 287, to reach his first overseas grand slam for four years. And he could be joined by fellow rookie compatriot Seone Mendez, who’s never been in the main draw of any grand slam women’s main draw but has given herself a dream chance with an equally gutsy win in qualifying at Roland Garros on Wednesday. Mendez, the 23-year-old daughter of former Socceroos international Gabriel ‘ChiChi’ Mendez, also prevailed 7-6 (9-7) 7-5 in a real battle to overcome American Caroline Dolehide, who’s 50 places higher than the Australian in the rankings. Mendez had to save four set points in the opening stanza before taking it after 57 minutes, and it needed nearly another hour before she reeled off the last of three straight games to earn a third-round qualifying date with the ninth qualifying seed Rebecca Marino. The Sydneysider will start an outsider in that contest, as she’s over 100 places behind the Canadian world No 116 Marino in the rankings. The rest of the Australian challenge faded on Wednesday, with Fourlis, Priscilla Hon, Arina Rodionova, Lizette Cabrera and Aleksandar Vukic all bowing out in second round clashes, leaving just two survivors from the dozen who’d begun the qualification quest.",Sport/Sport,Comeback kid Kubler storms home in quest for French Open dream,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/comeback-kid-kubler-storms-home-in-quest-for-french-open-dream
5/19/2022,"Every Australian worker will be up to $30,000 worse off in retirement under Scott Morrison’s flagship policy allowing people to raid their superannuation to help buy a home, according to Industry Super Australia analysis. In analysis released on Wednesday, ISA, which represents the profit-to-member industry fund sector jointly run by employers and unions, said the move would carve between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points a year from the returns enjoyed by retirement savers. This was because funds would need to hold more cash on hand to pay withdrawals to members, reducing the amount that can be pumped into far more lucrative but illiquid long-term investments such as real estate or infrastructure. “Not only will throwing super into the housing market jack up prices and make houses less affordable, but all Australian workers will also be worse off because of lower investment returns,” ISA’s chief executive, Bernie Dean, said. “Super is meant to be for people’s retirement, not supercharging house prices and pushing the home ownership dream further away.” Under the Coalition’s plan, people would be allowed to withdraw up to 40% of their superannuation, to a maximum of $50,000. They would be required to return the money to their fund when they sell the property, together with a share of any capital gain. If the scheme goes ahead a 30-year-old worker on the median wage who has $20,000 in the fund could be between $14,700 and $29,100 worse off by retirement, even if they did not draw down on their super for a house deposit, ISA said. Economists and the Coalition’s own minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, agree the plan would cause an increase in house prices in Australia, which are already some of the least affordable in the world. Morrison has defended the policy, saying it is “a balanced, responsible plan which we’ve thought through, which we think minimises any potential impact on house prices”. He also pointed to New Zealand, where workers are allowed to use their Kiwisaver superannuation accounts to help fund a home deposit. Dean rejected the comparison, saying that Kiwisaver returns were consistently worse than those enjoyed by Australians, in part due to the fact withdrawals for home purchases are allowed. Kiwisaver accounts return about 1% a year less than the average Australian balanced MySuper fund, according to ISA’s analysis. ISA said if Kiwisaver’s performance was replicated in Australia a 30-year-old on about $60,000 wages with a $20,000 starting balance could receive as much as $131,600 less in retirement. The Coalition’s policy is also opposed by the for-profit super sector, represented by the Financial Services Council. On Sunday, the FSC’s chief executive, Blake Briggs, said the policy “weakens the sole purpose of superannuation, which is to provide higher standards of living in retirement”. He said the idea had been rejected by a parliamentary inquiry. “The government’s own majority report into housing affordability and supply in Australia concluded that superannuation should only ever be used for housing if there were commensurate measures to increase supply,” he said. “The government has an obligation to do more to boost supply, otherwise unleashing superannuation savings on the housing market risks driving prices higher still.”",News/Australia news,"Coalition plan allowing first homebuyers to use super could shrink all workers’ retirement savings, industry analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/coalition-plan-allowing-first-homebuyers-to-use-super-could-shrink-all-workers-retirement-savings-industry-analysis-finds
