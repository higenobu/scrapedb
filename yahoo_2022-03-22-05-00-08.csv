3/22/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Monday confirmed a meeting between U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan and the Russian government, during which Sullivan demanded that Moscow follow international law and allow consular access to all U.S. citizens detained in Russia. State department spokesperson Ned Price said it is ""completely unacceptable"" that the United States has been denied consular access to detained American citizens in Russia. He said there has been no change to the case of WNBA All-Star player Brittney Griner, whom Russia said it had detained last month for possession of vape cartridges containing hash oil. The U.S. has still not been allowed consular access to Griner, Price said. Russia's foreign ministry said on Monday it had summoned Sullivan to tell him that President Joe Biden's calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" had pushed bilateral ties to the brink of collapse. ""It is awfully rich to hear a country speak about 'inappropriate comments' when that same country is engaged in mass slaughter, including strikes and attacks that have resulted in civilian lives,"" Price told reporters.

3/22/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Local officials in Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine have set up collection points where citizens can drop off donations of socks, medicine and tinned food for Russian troops fighting in Ukraine, according to messages from the officials seen by Reuters. Officials told local residents that Russian troops already had everything they needed, but that since citizens had expressed a desire to help, the local administrations had decided to accommodate those wishes. The head of one district administration said in a message that the aim was to provide troops with home comforts to supplement their basic supplies. Nearly a month after the invasion began, Russian military advances have slowed and supply lines are being disrupted by Ukrainian troops, leading to logistics problems, according to NATO member states and Ukraine's government. The Kremlin says the operation is on track. A notice attached with Scotch tape to the door of a grocery store in the Korochansky district of Belgorod region said that aid collection points had been set up in the local administration building in the nearby village of Shlyakhovo. A resident, who did not want to be identified, said he saw the notice on Saturday, and sent Reuters a photograph. The notice, which was unsigned, said: ""Friends, right now for our military the most important thing is medicine: strong pain relief, cold medicine, cough tablets, bandages, syringes, insulin, Novocaine, Lidocaine."" ""We are also accepting personal hygiene items, socks, hats, gloves, thermal underwear, cigarettes, head torches."" A person answering the telephone at the Shlyakhovo administration on Monday, when asked about the notice, said donations for the military could be dropped off at the administration building. Reuters sent requests for comment to the defence ministry in Moscow, the administration of the Belgorod region and the administration of Shlyakhovo village. None responded. HOME COMFORTS Local administration chiefs in three other localities in Belgorod region - the Graivoron, Krasnoyaruzhskiy and Belgorodsky districts - informed residents via social media on Feb. 27 that they had opened collection points for the military. The governor of Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, sent a similar message to local residents on March 3. All four officials said in their messages, posted on the VK social network, that the military had the supplies they needed. ""But they need our support and simple human attention: right now they really need a touch of home comfort, to defend our homeland,"" wrote Gennady Bondarev, head of the Graivoron administration. The items he solicited included water, non-perishable food and cereal grains. Some of the district chiefs said that, in parallel with help for the military, they were collecting donations for civilians who had fled the fighting. Officials in the three districts were still collecting supplies for the military, people in their offices said. Reuters could not independently verify the scale of the public response. The administrations in the three districts did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. In the city of Belgorod, the head of a neighbourhood resident's association sent out an appeal last week to the residents' group chat in messaging app Viber, asking for aid for troops. A resident included in the chat, who did not want to be identified, shared the messages with Reuters. The items requested by the association head in the chat included compasses, analogue watches, and AA and AAA batteries. Another resident in a different part of Belgorod region, who lives within walking distance of the Russian-Ukrainian border, said he had handed over donated supplies to Russian troops. He told Reuters on Friday that he had collected donations from local residents several times, loaded them into a van, and driven to the border where the supplies were transferred to an armoured personnel carrier and taken into Ukraine. He said he had handed over tea, food, and undergarments.

3/22/2022,"Roman Abramovich's yacht was off the coast of Turkey on Monday, ship-tracking data shows. His $600 million yacht, Solaris, is ""scenic cruising"" without a port destination, per MarineTraffic. It might be trying to confuse people about its final destination, a MarineTraffic spokesperson said. A luxury superyacht owned by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich that has been sailing without a destination for more than a week updated its status for the first time since leaving port, suggesting it has no immediate intention of docking, ship-tracking data shows. Solaris, a 140-feet vessel worth $600 million, was off the southwestern coast of Turkey and heading west, according to the tracking website MarineTraffic. On Monday, the website showed that the vessel's status changed to ""scenic cruising"" from ""awaiting orders,"" the status it had shown since leaving Tivat, Montenegro, on March 13. Georgios Hatzimanolis, a spokesperson for MarineTraffic, told Insider that though yachts and ships can change their status whenever they want, ""most likely in this instance"" Solaris is ""using the status to confuse people from where its final destination is."" ""Lots of speculation on if it will be Turkey, Israel, or even possibly the UAE,"" Hatzimanolis said. The locations of luxury assets owned by Russian oligarchs have been closely monitored since sanctions were levied against many of the country's elite in response to Moscow's ordering troops into Ukraine. European countries including Italy and France have seized yachts, private jets, and other assets from several sanctioned oligarchs. Abramovich, whose net worth is estimated at about $13.6 billion, according to Bloomberg, was sanctioned by the UK and the European Union, meaning his assets have been frozen and he's been barred from doing business there. Solaris had been docked in the Barcelona shipyard of the Spanish yacht-maintenance firm MB92 since late 2021. It left on March 8, shortly before Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, was sanctioned. Before the announcement of sanctions, some of Russia's wealthiest people sought to move their expensive boats and private jets to jurisdictions where they might be able to protect them from seizure. Abramovich's other superyacht, Eclipse, said to be worth $700 million, was just off the coast of Crete, a Greek island in the Mediterranean Sea, on Monday, according to MarineTraffic. The yacht has been sailing since it left St. Martin in the Caribbean on February 21, the ship-tracking website shows.

3/22/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces said Russian troops used stun grenades and gunfire to disperse a rally of pro-Ukrainian protesters in the occupied southern city of Kherson on Monday. Russia did not immediately comment on the incident. Moscow denies targeting civilians. Video footage showed several hundred protesters in Kherson's Freedom Square running to escape as projectiles land around them. Loud bangs can be heard and there are clouds of whitish smoke. Gunfire can also be heard. ""Russian security forces ran up, started throwing stun grenades into the crowd and shooting,"" the Ukrainian armed forces' press service said in a statement. It said at least one person was wounded but that it was unclear how they received their injuries. Reuters was unable to verify independently what weapons were fired. The video showed some protesters returning to the square. One man in a black hat strolled back, stopped across the road from Russian troops and stood there on his own, holding a small Ukrainian flag above his head. The city of Kherson, a regional capital of about 250,000 people, was the first big urban centre to fall into the hands of Russian troops after they invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Since then, groups of residents have staged regular rallies in the centre of Kherson, protesting against the occupation and showing their support for the government in Kyiv by waving Ukrainian flags. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian authorities said members of Russia's National Guard had detained more than 400 people in Kherson region for protesting against the occupation. It accused Russia of trying to create a police state there. Russia calls the war a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from ""Nazis"". The West describes this as a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression to subdue a country President Vladimir Putin describes as illegitimate.
