2/17/2022,"Labor has ambushed the government by suspending standing orders to debate the Coalition’s firearms legislation, which then passed the lower house without opposition. The surprise tactic saw the government leader in the house, Peter Dutton, at first attempt to shut down the push before government members voted with Labor to debate their legislation in a bizarre scene in the House of Representatives on Thursday afternoon.  The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, told Guardian Australia the leadership group had decided to support the bill in line with a resolution of caucus in 2019 that, although it opposes mandatory minimums, Labor will not block bills that tackle serious crimes, such as firearms and child sexual offences. The passage of the bill is the second time in two days that Labor has sidestepped attempts by the Morrison government to wedge it on national security, after helping to pass the visa cancellation bill on Wednesday. The parliamentary tactic is designed to show-up the fact that the bills are a “test for Labor”, as the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, described the visa bill, rather than a good faith attempt to amend the laws. Labor has flagged its intention to amend the visa bill, but with just two Senate sitting days left in late March before the 2022 election, it is unclear whether either bill will progress to a final vote. The government’s firearms bill introduced on Wednesday, proposes to increase maximum sentences for trafficking and set a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison for firearms offences. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said there are 260,000 illegal firearms in Australia, which criminals use to “threaten and terrorise … innocent bystanders”. “That is why it is important that we have legislation in place that would prevent the importation of these weapons,” Andrews said. On Thursday morning Keneally declined to state a position on the bill, telling ABC Radio that Labor had yet to see the legislation, adding that “keeping people safe, and organised crime and firearms are of course important issues”. Shortly after noon, the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, moved to suspend standing orders to bring on a debate on the firearms legislation. After Dutton intervened, Liberal MP Kevin Andrews in the Speaker’s chair asked the house to divide to disagree to the motion. Although at first government members gathered to the right of the Speaker’s chair to silence Burke, they then swapped sides to join Labor in voting to debate the bill. Labor members including the leader, Anthony Albanese, queried whether the rules allowed them to change sides but the Speaker, Andrew Wallace, allowed it. Wallace then gave the call to Andrews to speak on another matter, before Albanese noted that because the motion was carried the firearms bill must be debated. Labor’s Brendan O’Connor asked to speak but Dutton moved to give the bill a third reading, which passed on the voices just 19 minutes after the suspension. In the government’s account of the episode, Labor hoped to goad the government into shutting debate down but the tactic backfired. Keneally said she and the leadership group had considered the bill on Thursday. Labor decided to support the bill because it was “fairly straightforward” and consistent with the caucus position that when in opposition: “While we don’t support mandatory minimums we’re not going to let that stand in the way of achieving important outcomes to tackle serious crimes.” In 2020 Labor helped the government pass a bill with mandatory minimum sentences for child sexual offences, despite its opposition to mandatory minimums. Labor will not seek to amend the firearms bill in the Senate, Keneally said. “We can’t govern from opposition – Mr Morrison seemed quite clear in his intent to politicise national security in the context of an election, trying to manufacture a difference with the opposition when, in reality, one does not exist.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Tuesday Scott Morrison encouraged Coalition MPs and senators in the party room to sharpen the differences with Labor on national security in a bid to recover the government’s position before the 2022 election. Labor’s support for the firearms bill gives the government a clear way to pass it in the Senate in budget week, but the fate of the visa cancellation bill is still unclear. On Wednesday Hawke promised a vote before the election but appeared to concede in question time that “we have run out of time to pass the bill”. In debate on Wednesday evening, Hawke said: “I want this to be supported in the Senate. We have spoken to the crossbench, and we believe we have support.” Despite the claim, senators Rex Patrick, Stirling Griff and Jacqui Lambie have all confirmed to Guardian Australia their positions have not changed since October, when they combined with Labor and the Greens to defeat the bill.",News/Australia news,Labor helps pass Coalition firearms bill after lower house ambush,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/labor-helps-pass-coalition-firearms-bill-after-lower-house-ambush
2/17/2022,"The use of intrusive spyware by members of the European Union is expected to face new scrutiny following revelations that the mobile phones of two more Polish citizens with close links to an opposition senator were targeted by a client of NSO Group, according to security experts. Forensic analysis by Amnesty International found that both Magdalena Łośko, the former assistant to Polish senator Krzysztof Brejza, and Brejza’s father, Ryszard Brejza, received text messages in 2019 that researchers said were technically consistent with spyware attacks by clients of NSO Group using Pegasus.  In both cases, the timing of the targeting matched the appearance of Łośko’s and Ryszard Brejza’s mobile phone numbers in a leaked database at the heart of the Pegasus Project, an investigation into NSO Group by a media consortium including the Guardian, Wyborcza and Die Zeit, coordinated by the French non-profit group Forbidden Stories. The data leak is a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to have been selected as people of interest by government clients of NSO Group. The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets that NSO’s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance. The presence of an individual’s phone number in the database does not mean the mobile phone was hacked. NSO has strongly denied that the data has any connection to the Israeli firm and said the phone numbers on the list are not targets of NSO customers. When successfully deployed against a target, Pegasus can infiltrate a mobile phone, giving the user of the spyware full access to phone calls, text messages, encrypted messages and photographs. It can track a mobile phone user’s location and turn the phone into a remote listening device. Polish authorities’ use of Pegasus first came to light in December 2021, after the Associated Press, in association with researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, reported that Pegasus – the NSO Group spyware – had been used against at least three people, including Krzysztof Brejza. In his case, forensic analysis of his mobile phone showed it had been compromised numerous times in 2019 while he was running the electoral campaign of the opposition Civil Platform party. The attacks stopped a few days after the vote. The new revelations by the Pegasus Project indicate that a client of NSO Group also sought to hack at least two individuals close to Brejza. Amnesty International’s security lab found four suspicious text messages were sent to Łośko in April 2019, when she was running Brejza’s campaign for the European parliament. Amnesty found 10 suspicious text messages on Ryszard Brejza’s mobile between July and August 2019. Amnesty said that, in both cases, the SMS messages directed the recipient to websites that were created before the attacks in 2019 and are no longer active. The available forensic evidence did not allow security researchers to confirm whether attempts to hack either Łośko or Ryszard Brejza were successful. Poland’s Central Anticorruption Bureau, the CBA, bought Pegasus in 2017 using funds from the Ministry of Justice, according to documents presented at a Polish senate hearing by the former head of the National Audit Office. The CBA has previously declined to confirm whether it used Pegasus against any individuals, but it has said that any use of the surveillance tool would have obtained legally required consents. A spokesperson for Poland’s special services said, in response to a request for comment by the Pegasus Project, that it cannot comment on reports of methods of its “operational work” and would not comment on whether any specific individuals had been subjected to methods of “operational work”. The spokesperson said that any allegations that surveillance methods had been used against individuals for “political purposes” were false. NSO Group said in a statement: “Without referring to any specific governmental customer, a misuse of cyberintelligence tools is a serious matter and all credible allegations are immediately investigated. Unfortunately, a number of organisations with clear political agendas continue to release biased, inaccurate and incomplete reports based on scant, if any, evidence. As repeatedly stated, NSO does not operate the technology, and [is] not privy to the collected data. The company does not and cannot know who the targets of the customers are.” The company has previously said that its clients are only allowed to use its spyware to target criminals and terrorists. The company is facing intense pressure in the European parliament, where the bloc’s data watchdog has advised the use of Pegasus should be banned because of its power to intrude into the lives of its targets. In interviews with the Pegasus Project, Ryszard Brejza described being shaken up by the news that his mobile phone was targeted with the intrusive spyware, particularly since the suspicious text messages he was sent were catered to appeal to his personal interests. In one case, he received messages laced with the suspected Pegasus-linked domain advertising a holiday home on the Baltic Sea, at a time when he was about to go on holiday on the Baltic coast. Łośko, who is now a member of the Polish parliament, received suspicious SMS messages in 2019 about bullying, which researchers now say are linked to Pegasus. While she never sought out reports on bullying, Łośko recalled having conversations about bullying at the time. In a statement, Amnesty said: “These new findings increase concerns, not only for politicians, but for the whole of Poland’s civil society in general, particularly given the context of the government’s record of persistently subverting human rights and the rule of law.”",News/World news,More Polish opposition figures found to have been targeted by Pegasus spyware,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/more-polish-opposition-figures-found-to-have-been-targeted-by-pegasus-spyware
2/17/2022,"When presidents Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron faced each other at either end of an improbably long, white table last week, the image became a metaphor for the fraught negotiations over Ukraine. Now the table stakes have been raised after furniture makers in Spain and Italy both claimed that they were commissioned by the Kremlin to make the now famous four-metre-long table.  Vicente Zaragozá, head of the furniture company that bears his name in Alcàsser, near Valencia, says he is in no doubt that the work is his. In an interview on Spanish radio on Tuesday, Zaragozá said that as soon as he saw the photograph he started examining the table for defects. “I have an eye for the smallest defects so that we can keep improving,” he said, adding that the table was made from Alpine white beech inlaid with gold leaf. However, Renato Pologna, owner of Oak, a family-run furniture business based in Como, is baffled by the Spaniard’s claims. “Look, this is a story I’ve been hearing about for the past few days,” Pologna said. “Sincerely, I don’t know what to say, because I did this work in 1995-96 and photos of the table were published in books, mostly Russian ones, which were officially published in 2000. “This man, who I don’t know, says he made this table in 2005 – therefore, something doesn’t quite add up. As proof we have all the certificates for the work done, and even the recognition of the president, who at the time was Boris Yeltsin.” The Spanish company, which ceased trading in July 2020 and whose Facebook page is in English and Russian, worked on numerous commissions to make furniture for the Kremlin and former Soviet republics from 2002-2006, among them the Uzbek president’s kitchen and dining room. Zaragozá broke down in tears as he told the interviewer: “We have made bigger and more beautiful tables, but seeing photographs of this table makes me proud that, as a Spaniard and a Valencian, I have done something worthwhile.” Pologna remains unmoved. “The books published in 2000 show the interiors of the Kremlin building where you see a photo of the table made by us,” he said. “Maybe the Spanish guy made a copy that went somewhere else, who knows. We’re talking about a table, not an aircraft. It could be that he made a copy.”",News/World news,Table talk: Italian and Spanish firms vie to claim credit for Putin’s furniture ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/table-talk-italian-and-spanish-firms-vie-to-claim-credit-for-putin-furniture
2/17/2022,"Australia and New Zealand have reached an “in principle” deal to resettle refugees from Australia’s offshore detention regime, with negotiations due to be finalised in “the next few weeks”. The Australian home affairs department secretary, Mike Pezzullo, told a Senate committee hearing on Monday that New Zealand’s longstanding offer to accept 150 refugees from Australia’s offshore islands “would go back for a final round of negotiations”.  “Subject to a number of conditions Australia would want to see fulfilled, it is an offer that is both welcomed and appreciated,” Pezzullo said. Negotiations so far have been stymied by Australia’s insistence that refugees must not be able to enter the country “the backdoor way”. Australia has previously said it is reluctant to allow refugees to resettle in New Zealand because, after five years, they could claim citizenship and would be eligible to travel without restriction to Australia: a position belied by the fact that Australia regularly prevents some New Zealand citizens from entering Australia. New Zealand, in turn, has been reluctant to put additional conditions on visas or residencies granted to refugees, with the immigration minister, Kris Faafoi, saying last year that New Zealand believed anybody resettled there should have the “full rights of New Zealand citizens” – including the right to travel to and work in Australia. That remains a sticking point, with Pezzullo confirming that there would need to be “some kind of ironclad … or firm blocking” of any “backdoor” ability for a person to use a 444 special purpose visa that would allow them long-term residency in Australia. The home affairs deputy secretary, Marc Ablong, said “the final set of those negotiations is expected in the next few weeks on the New Zealand side as to where their position lies”. New Zealand officials were tightlipped over whether this condition would be met. In a statement, Faafoi’s office said negotiations had not concluded and any agreement would need cabinet approval. “This government has confirmed, on many occasions, that it will honour the offer made under the previous National-led government to accept refugees whom Australia has detained offshore,” it said. It added that any arrangement would involve the UNHCR to help assess who should be part of New Zealand’s intake, and any refugees considered by New Zealand for resettlement would undergo assessment and screening processes, as is usual for all accepted refugees. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nine years after Australia restarted offshore processing, and more than seven years since the last asylum seeker was sent offshore, roughly 230 people remained in offshore processing, split between Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Those people were no longer, technically, in detention camps, but their movements remained heavily restricted. According to government figures, 1,117 “transitory persons” were in Australia, brought back from offshore processing islands – mostly asylum seekers medically evacuated from the islands. This cohort may also be considered – by Australia at least – as candidates for resettlement. Logistical challenges created by Covid-19 meant New Zealand was well behind on meeting its commitment to resettle 1,500 refugees each year. According to government immigration data, the country had only taken in 414 refugees between April 2021 and February 2022. In the previous financial year, that number was 263.
