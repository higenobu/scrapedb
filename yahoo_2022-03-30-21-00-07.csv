3/30/2022,"On April 1, Japan will change its legal definition of an adult from those who are at least 20 years old to those who are 18 years old and older.

The change will upend over 140 years of civil code dating back to the Imperial Meiji period of the late 1800s.

The new code will give those who are 18 and over the rights and responsibilities that come with being a legal adult. They will no longer need parental consent to enter into contracts, such as signing up for credit cards, loans and apartment leases, and will also have the freedom to make life decisions regarding their studies, work, place of living and marriage.

Stricter punishments will also be applied to 18- and 19-year-olds for criminal offenses, as they will no longer be considered minors. News and media outlets will also be able to report their names publicly for offenses. Currently, homicide is the only charge that minors can be criminally prosecuted for.

Laws involving identification cards, passports and jury duty will also be affected by the change, but the rules for alcohol, tobacco and gambling will continue to prohibit participation until age 20, to promote healthy living.

Young Japanese, however, will still be unable to legally drink, smoke or gamble, as the age limit for those activities will remain 20.

The motive behind the change in civil code involves the notion that people should participate in society sooner, against the backdrop of Japan’s low birth rates. The voting age was decreased to 18 in 2016, and the civil code revision seeks to further engagement among 18- and 19-year-olds.

The change also comes amid discussions of whether the Japanese Juvenile Law is too lenient. In 2021, the Juvenile Code was amended to categorize 18- and 19-year-olds as “specified juveniles” who were given harsher punishments for breaking the law than those under 18. The change to the legal age will reinforce and increase these penalties.

3/30/2022,"A viral video appears to show Ukrainian troops shooting captured Russians. The BBC spoke to language and injury experts about what the video shows. The BBC was not able to verify the video, but the experts say some parts of it were plausible. A viral video appearing to show Ukrainian troops shooting captured Russians has not been verified, but could be real, experts said. The five-minute video purported to show Ukrainians shooting Russian prisoners of war in the kneecaps and beating them, as Insider's Natalie Musumeci previously reported. The apparent prisoners of war can be seen lying tied up and bloodied on the ground at one point in the video. The BBC fact-checked the video, which it said first started circulating on social media on March 27. It spread on pro-Russia accounts, the BBC reported. Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said on Sunday that the video was staged by Russia to ""discredit"" Ukrainian forces. The BBC noted that the troops in the video were wearing the blue armbands that Ukrainian troops are wearing, but that this does not confirm that they are actually Ukrainian troops, and that they were wearing no other identifying parts of a uniform. One language expert told the BBC that the people questioning the apparent prisoners of war have accents ""in line with what you'd expect from Ukrainians speaking Russian."" But the BBC noted that they could also be pro-Russian separatists. Trauma surgeons and former military doctors also spoke to the BBC about the apparent shooting in the video, though they wished to be unnamed in the report. One of them said the fact that the men who were shot did not scream or bleed a lot was not necessarily a sign that the video was suspicious — something people had pointed out on social media, the BBC noted. He said that soldiers he had treated for gunshot wounds did not scream, and that some of the soldiers not bleeding much could be because the video shows them having a tourniquet. ""It is my opinion that the footage cannot be categorized as 'fake' purely based on the images seen. This requires an investigation for war crimes,"" he said. Another doctor told the BBC: ""It appears genuine ... these meet the description of punishment shootings to the limbs."" The video was taken at a farm in Malaya Rohan, which is located southeast of the city of Kharkiv, the BBC reported, after analyzing satellite data. The Washington Post also reported the same location. The BBC reported that the weather conditions in the video were consistent with it having been taken on March 26, though noted that the video was undated. The BBC noted that Ukrainian troops were in the surrounding area at that time. Oleksiy Arestovich, an advisor to Ukraine's government, told The Times of London the government was ""taking this very seriously and there will be an immediate investigation."" The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the video was full of ""monstrous images"" and called for an investigation.
