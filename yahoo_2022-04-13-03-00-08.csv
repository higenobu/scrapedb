4/13/2022,"Andrew Yang didn‚Äôt do so well as a presidential candidate, and he isn‚Äôt so hot at being a presidential historian either. The former Democratic presidential hopeful wrote a tweet Monday that he might have assumed would be the ticket to inspire a massively polarized nation to come together in unity. Sadly for Yang, the only unity he inspired was unified mockery on social media at the example he chose to represent his dream of bipartisanship. ‚ÄúLincoln won the presidency on the brand new Republican ticket in 1860 with 39.8% in a four-way race,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúHe took a Democrat, Andrew Johnson as his running mate in 1864.‚Äù Apparently, Yang didn‚Äôt know or care that Johnson was a terrible example for promoting a bipartisan government since he has long been cited by historians as a leading contender for worst president. Despite being against secession, Johnson owned enslaved people and was against allowing Black Americans to vote, writing, ‚ÄúThis is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men.‚Äù Oh, and he was the first president to be impeached. Naturally, Twitter users felt obliged to fill in the blanks for Yang. On Tuesday, Yang attempted to double down by suggesting that just because the example he used to support his idea was terrible, doesn‚Äôt mean it was a bad idea. Andrew Johnson was unfortunately a terrible, destructive President. It only heightens the tragedy of Lincoln‚Äôs assassination. It doesn‚Äôt mean a unity ticket is a bad idea. ‚Äî Andrew Yangüß¢‚¨ÜÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ (@AndrewYang) April 12, 2022 But that didn‚Äôt work out so well for him either. American historian here.

4/13/2022,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly said Russia's war with Ukraine is ""meant to"" stop US-led global domination. ""This domination is built on gross violations of international law,"" Lavrov said, according to RT. Russia President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday that Russia's unprovoked war with Ukraine is ""meant to put an end"" to US-led global domination and the expansion of NATO, according to a report. ""Our special military operation is meant to put an end to the unabashed expansion [of NATO] and the unabashed drive towards full domination by the US and its Western subjects on the world stage,"" Lavrov told the state-owned television news channel Rossiya 24, according to a translation from Russian state-run media outlet RT. Additionally, Lavrov accused the United States of international law violations due to what he said were America's attempts to impose its own ""rules-based international order,"" according to the report. ""This domination is built on gross violations of international law and under some rules, which they are now hyping so much and which they make up on a case-by-case basis,"" Lavrov said during the interview, RT reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, with Russian troops surrounding and shelling towns and cities across the country. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Monday that at least 1,842 civilians have been killed in attacks across Ukraine, though it said ""the actual figures are considerably higher."" Additionally, more than 4.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country during Russia's invasion, the UN said. When Putin announced his invasion of Ukraine, he said he was seeking the ""denazification"" of Ukraine, a country whose democratically-elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish. Putin has made other attempts to defend the war with baseless claims that genocide was being committed against ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's pursuit of NATO membership has also been cited by Putin as a justification for his decision to invade Ukraine. Zelenskyy said in March said he has ""cooled down"" about Ukraine's bid to join NATO. Earlier last month, Lavrov offered up another reason for Russia invading Ukraine, saying that the Kremlin was trying to prevent a separate war in Ukraine. ""The goal of Russia's special military operation is to stop any war that could take place on Ukrainian territory or that could start from there,"" Lavrov said, according to a tweet that was posted by the Russian embassy in London. Since Russia invaded, Ukrainian forces have put up fierce resistance, resulting in heavy losses for Russian troops despite Ukrainian troops being largely outnumbered and outgunned by the Russians.

4/13/2022,"A man died Monday after he was run over by a car he was trying to steal a catalytic converter from in Sacramento, California, authorities said. Officers responded around 4:45 a.m. to reports of a collision between a vehicle and a pedestrian in the 8100 block of Timberlake Way, Sacramento police told Fox News Digital via email. CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT INCREASING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN 2022 Police said that officers arrived at the scene and found the man with serious injuries. He was rushed to a hospital and was pronounced dead. The man was identified as 28-year-old Jose Adolfo Rangel, the Sacramento Bee reported, citing the Sacramento County Coroner's Office. Investigators said they believe the suspect was tampering with the vehicle to steal its catalytic converter before the collision. Catalytic converters are part of a vehicle‚Äôs exhaust system and control emissions. It contains valuable metals that criminals can cut out in seconds and sell to scrapyards for profit. Replacing a stolen catalytic converter could cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. Catalytic converter thefts have risen in cities across the country this year. Police in Minneapolis have reported a nearly 38% jump in catalytic converter theft compared to this time last year. Dallas has seen a 20% increase, and Philadelphia police have seen a 172% increase. According to Las Vegas Police Department data, officers have seen a roughly 87% hike.

4/13/2022,"This article originally appeared on Oxygen Landmine exercises are a form of weight training that can level up your fitness game in more ways than one, especially when you‚Äôre short on time or stuck in a crowded gym. The landmine setup -- either sliding a barbell into a landmine attachment on a rack or simply placing one end of the barbell into a corner and adding weight to the free end -- allows you to target muscles differently, and even a minor change can create a new stimulus and demand for your neuromuscular coordination to trigger more results. Incorporating landmine exercises enables you to set up full-body engagement, increase lean muscle tissue, improve strength and sculpt hard-to-reach accessory muscles. Landmine training can also help you to maintain correct body posture, alignment and improve balance. So, whether your goal is to gain lean muscle tissue, lose body fat or improve strength, exposing your body to different training methods like the landmine will shock your body and create results. Proper form is imperative to avoid injury. The key is to keep your gaze at midline and allow your core to remain square with the bar at all times. Above all, train with intention -- connecting mind to muscle. Landmine squats are a full-body exercise and are perfect for building full-body strength. Targets: Hamstrings, quadriceps, glutes, core, triceps, deltoids, and trapezius muscles. Pro Tip: Try to avoid toes passing your knees and drive up to standing position, placing emphasis in your heels to target your glutes. Landmine deadlifts are another great full-body exercise and great for building strength. It's by far the best exercise for posterior chain muscle strengthening (the muscles that run up and down the back of your body). Targets: Lower back, upper back, arms, legs, and glutes. Pro Tip: Keep your core engaged at all times, chest lifted up and hinge at the hip, keeping your knees soft. Landmine presses are a great way to developupper-body strength and trying out new angles of movement. Targets: Shoulders, upper pectoralis major, biceps and triceps. Pro Tip: Engage your core, square up with the bar and keep your gaze at midline. Start the press at at elbow height, and avoid flaring your elbow when pressing up. An upright row is an effective exercise to build strength in the shoulders and upper back. You may stand completely erect or slightly hinge at the hips to command core engagement for full-body participation. Targets: Traps and deltoids. The landmine twist is a rotational abdominal movement performed using an angled barbell anchored at floor level in a landmine device. It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room or to your gym squat rack. Targets: Obliques and the transversus abdominis. Pro Tip: Use a rhythmic and controlled breath to allow for full muscle engagement. Mind-muscle connection is very important to avoid injury.

4/13/2022,"Russia is readying a massive, new offensive in eastern Ukraine, hoping to reverse its fortunes on the battlefield after a catastrophic start to seven weeks of war. A long convoy of combat vehicles has jammed highways across northeastern Ukraine in preparation for an attack that could begin within days, and the Kremlin has named a general known for overseeing Moscow's campaign in Syria to lead it. A look at Russia's military objectives and challenges it faces. A BOTCHED BLITZ A failed Russian attempt to storm Kyiv and other big cities took a heavy toll in personnel and equipment, boosted morale in Ukraine and allowed it to rally broad international support. ‚ÄúThe myth about the invincibility of the Russian military as the second-most powerful in the world has been shattered to much surprise of the Ukrainians themselves,‚Äù Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press. The flow of Western weapons into Ukraine and a growing popular resistance to Russian aggression will further raise the costs of war for Moscow. President Vladimir Putin badly needs a quick battlefield victory to find an exit from what increasingly looks like a disastrous quagmire. Russia's focus is turning to Ukraine‚Äôs industrial heartland, known as the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since the conflict there erupted shortly after the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. ‚ÄúIn the first round, Russia has lost face both politically and militarily,"" Zhdanov said. ""It has done every possible stupid thing in the careless hope for a blitz ... but it will make the Russian attack in the next round even more furious.‚Äù REFOCUS AND REDEPLOYMENT After their retreat from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, Russian forces pulled back to the territory of Belarus, Moscow‚Äôs ally, as well as areas in western Russia to be rearmed and resupplied for the new offensive. Retired British Gen. Sir Richard Barrons estimated the Russians have ‚Äúprobably lost about 25% of the ground forces they started out with in the sense that those have been units that have become noncombat effective.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo they‚Äôre amalgamating them, they‚Äôre refitting them, they‚Äôre reinforcing them and then moving them around,‚Äù Barrons told AP. Russia also was trying to move additional equipment from elsewhere and mobilize reservists in a desperate attempt to build a sufficient attack force, said Barrons, a co-chair of the consulting group Universal Defence & Security Solutions. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve had a beating, and they will have only a few weeks to get better,‚Äù he said. Recently, Russian troops have been seen rolling into eastern Ukraine to move into attack positions. A convoy stretched for about 13 kilometers (8 miles) on a highway east of Kharkiv, heading south toward Ukrainian lines near Izyum, a strategic road junction. At the same time, Russian forces rushed to crush remaining pockets of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol after besieging the vital Sea of Azov port for nearly 1 1/2 months. The offensive is expected to start once Mariupol is fully under Russian control, and the troops pulled from areas near Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy complete their redeployment. WILL A NEW COMMANDER MAKE THE DIFFERENCE? Gen. Alexander Dvornikov was appointed the new military commander for the campaign in Ukraine. The 60-year-old soldier is one of Russia‚Äôs most experienced officers, credited with leading Moscow's forces to victory in Syria in a ruthless campaign to shore up President Bashar Assad‚Äôs regime in a civil war that saw entire cities flattened and millions displaced. In 2016, Putin awarded Dvornikov the Hero of Russia medal, one of the country‚Äôs highest awards, and named him the chief of the Southern Military District, commanding units in southwestern Russia. Dvornikov's appointment is seen as reflecting the Kremlin's awareness to quickly improve poor coordination among various forces that hampered previous military efforts. Skeptics point out, however, that the Syrian campaign involved a relatively small number of troops, unlike the massive operation in Ukraine. TRYING NEW BATTLEFIELD TACTICS Ukrainian and Western experts expect the Russians to try to encircle Ukrainian forces in Donbas with a pincer movement by advancing from Izyum in the north and Mariupol in the south. Some predict Russia also may try to use its forces north of Crimea to try to capture the industrial hubs of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro on the Dnieper River, effectively cutting Ukraine in half. Barrons said the Russians are focusing on the east ‚Äùinstead of trying to do three or four big things at once and spreading the air power and the logistics.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe key conundrum is, can the Russians muster enough force ... good enough to overwhelm a very good Ukrainian defensive position by sheer weight of brutality‚Äù by concentrating firepower and troops in a few key locations, he said. WILL RUSSIA'S LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS PERSIST? Despite a new commander, the offensive will likely face the same logistical challenges Russian troops encountered early in the campaign. During the botched attempt to storm Kyiv, Russian convoys stretched along highways leading to the capital, becoming easy prey for Ukrainian artillery, drones and scouts. Supporting the operations in the east could be equally hard, with Russian supply lines likely to face hit-and-run raids, helped by the arrival of spring as foliage offers natural cover for Ukrainian scouts and guerrillas. Control of the skies also has been a problem, with Ukrainian air defense assets continuing to shoot down Russian warplanes, making it more difficult for ground troops to advance. In recent days, Russia has launched strikes on Ukrainian long-range air defense systems in apparent preparation for the offensive. ‚ÄúIf the Russians learned the lessons of their failure so far and could concentrate more force and could connect their air force to the ground forces better and could sort the logistics out, then they might start to overwhelm the Ukrainian positions eventually, although I still think it would be a battle of enormous attrition,‚Äù Barrons told AP. MORE FAVORABLE TERRAIN FOR RUSSIA? During the eight years of fighting separatists in the east, Ukrainian forces have built multilayered defenses, which Russian troops failed to break despite persistent attacks since the invasion began Feb. 24. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been fighting in these current positions in the Donbas for about eight years, so they‚Äôre very seasoned and they‚Äôre very well prepared,"" Barrons said of Ukrainian forces. He noted, however, that ""this will be different because the Russian onslaught will be potentially very much greater‚Äù and the east's flat terrain could give the Russians an edge. ‚ÄúThe sort of ambush tactics the Ukrainians were highly successful with around Kiev may not apply in the Donbas,‚Äù Barrons said. ‚ÄúAnd if the Russians were capable of maneuvering their armor so tanks, armored infantry and armored artillery at speed, they could get behind the Ukrainian position. It is going to be a much harder, bigger fight than we‚Äôve seen so far.‚Äù Ukraine has pleaded with the West for warplanes, long-range air defense systems, heavy artillery and armor to counter a massive Russian edge in firepower. ‚ÄúThere is a battle of time and space between the Russians and Ukrainians for the Russians to muster enough force and the Ukrainians to get the weapons that they need and rehearse themselves for what will be a bigger and slightly different battle, and I think it is finely balanced,‚Äù Barrons said. FOR PUTIN, A RACE AGAINST TIME After earlier battlefield failures, Putin desperately needs a quick success in the east. Battered by Western sanctions, Russia lacks financial resources for a protracted conflict. If the fighting drags on, it will inevitably worsen the economy and could bring social tensions, eroding the Kremlin‚Äôs support base. The military already has put its most capable combat units in the campaign, and continued fighting will likely force it to call up more reservists and throw fresh conscripts into combat ‚Äî moves that could be extremely unpopular. Putin could be hoping to quickly expand the territory under separatist control in the east, then try to force Ukraine into concessions in negotiations to wrap up the campaign and spin it as victory. ‚Äî- Associated Press writers Yuras Karmanau in Lviv, Ukraine, and Danica Kirka in London contributed. ‚Äî- Follow the AP‚Äôs coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"EXPLAINER: New front, same challenges for Russian offensive",https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-front-same-challenges-russian-162858088.html
