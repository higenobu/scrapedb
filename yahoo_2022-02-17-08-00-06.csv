2/17/2022,"By Karen Freifeld (Reuters) - New York's attorney general on Wednesday pounced on former President Donald Trump's defense of company's financial statements, saying the five-page statement Trump issued a day earlier contradicted a court filing by his attorneys. ""It is not unusual for parties to a legal proceeding to disagree about the facts,"" the attorney general's office wrote in a letter filed in New York state court. ""But it is truly rare for a party to publicly disagree with statements submitted by his own attorneys in a signed pleading -- let alone one day after the pleading was filed."" Attorney General Letitia James is conducting a probe into whether the Trumps inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans, and reduced values to lower tax bills. Trump's attorneys repeatedly stated that he did not know enough to respond to allegations of inaccurate valuations. But the former president's five-page statement got into detail about possible discrepancies, implying that he had more knowledge than his lawyers said. On Monday, the attorney general's office made public a Feb. 9 letter from Trump's longtime accountant, Mazars, which said the Trump Organization's financial statements for 2011 through 2020 should no longer be relied on and that it would no longer do work for the former president's New York-based real estate business. On Tuesday, Trump issued a five-page statement disparaging the attorney general and other New York officials, calling the investigation a political and racist attack, claiming Mazars had essentially been forced to resign, and defending the financial statements. ""Remember when the attorney general and or District Attorney say they think my financial statements may be high, I don't even include these branding numbers in them, which is far more than any discrepancy they may have,"" Trump wrote. Instead of the ""sham investigation"" of his business, Trump said in another part of the five-page diatribe, law enforcement and the ""fake news media"" should look into former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as well as ""murderers, drug dealers and rapists."" In a court filing on Monday in response to the attorney general's allegations of misleading financial statements, Trump, through his attorneys, repeatedly denied he had knowledge or information to form a belief as to the claims. The attorney general is seeking testimony from Trump and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, as part of her civil probe of the company's business practices. Justice Arthur Engoron in New York state court in Manhattan will hear arguments on Thursday on whether subpoenas for the testimony should be enforced. A separate but overlapping criminal case involving the company's business practices is being conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney, which the attorney general joined in May.

2/17/2022,"Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office sold its entire position in Facebook parent Meta last quarter. The New York-based firm unveiled new sizeable stakes in Snap and Chevron. Druckenmiller also dumped holdings in Penn National Gaming, Moderna, and Zoom Video. Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller's family office ditched its $35.9 million stake in Facebook parent Meta last quarter, suggesting the social media company's shift in focus to the metaverse may not have reflected an immediately bullish opportunity to him. Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office revealed a new stake worth $67 million in Snap, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Monday showed. The New York-based firm, which manages Druckenmiller's personal wealth, disclosed his biggest acquisition in the last quarter was a near-$100 million position in oil major Chevron. The former hedge fund boss has been managing his own money through the family office since closing his fund, Duquesne Capital, in 2010. He has a net worth of $10.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He dumped his holdings in Meta before the company's shocking 26% plunge in share price earlier this month. Meta lost more than $230 billion in value on February 3, the largest one-day loss in US corporate history, after posting a $10 billion operating loss from its metaverse business. It warned of further hefty losses this year due to the impact of Apple's privacy changes. Druckenmiller's firm also dumped stakes in casino operator Penn National Gaming, COVID-19 vaccine developer Moderna, and pandemic-era winner Zoom Video Communications. Its largest position is a $51 million stake in Coupang, also known as the ""Amazon of South Korea."" Recent securities filings from other billionaire investors suggest Big Tech has been fading from preferences even before January's brutal tech sell-off. Quarterly 13F filings, required by the SEC for portfolios holding at least $100 million in US equities, provide a look at positions held by Wall Street's largest stock pickers. George Soros, the founder of Soros Fund Management, trimmed his positions in Amazon and Alphabet last quarter. His firm also slashed its position in the largest ETF that tracks the Nasdaq by 97% from the previous quarter to a stake now worth just $9.4 million. In another example of well-timed investments, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a billion-dollar stake in Activision Blizzard last quarter, before Microsoft agreed to acquire the video-games company in January.

2/17/2022,"Kim Jong Un had hundreds endure freezing temperatures to listen to a speech honoring his late father. People stood outside in temperatures around 5 degrees Fahrenheit without gloves or ear protection. Some North Korea observers speculated that Kim and top officials may have been using heaters during the speech. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sat outside alongside other top officials and hundreds of attendees in freezing temperatures to listen to a speech about his father and former North Korean leader Kim Jong II on Tuesday, according to state media. The celebratory event marking the 80th anniversary of the birth of Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011, was held outside in the northern city of Samjiyon, and the maximum temperature was 5 degrees Fahrenheit, according to NK News. Although North Korea claims that Kim Jong Il was born at a secret site near Samjiyon in 1942, Soviet records suggest he was actually born in eastern Russia. Some North Korea watchers, comparing this celebration to past events, suspect that Kim and other officials on stage may have been using heaters to keep warm. —Colin Zwirko (@ColinZwirko) February 16, 2022 Colin Zwirko, a senior analytic correspondent for NK News, noticed a large clump of wires could be seen running underneath the red carpet under the long desk at which Kim was seated. The speech celebrating the Kim family lasted about 30 minutes, during which time attendees stood at attention without gloves or ear coverings. Top North Korean official Ri Il Hwan praised Kim Jong Il for challenging ""US imperialists"" and providing a ""stepping stone"" and leaving a ""revolutionary legacy"" for Kim Jong Un, according to state media. The event held on Tuesday was the first ""National Meeting,"" as the events are called, since July 2019. These events usually take place on the day before major holidays, including the birthdays of former and current leaders.

2/17/2022,"Ukrainian athlete Vladyslav Hareskevych held a ""no war"" sign after competing at the 2022 Olympics. Hareskevych, a skeleton athlete, spoke to Insider after returning home to Kyiv this week. He said he was hopeful that a Russian invasion could be avoided, but said the atmosphere is tense. A Ukrainian athlete who staged a silent anti-war protest at the Winter Olympics is now back home in his country's capital city of Kyiv, where he says the streets are empty and people are worried about a possible Russian invasion. Vladyslav Heraskevych made headlines on February 11, when he held up a sign reading ""No war in Ukraine"" after finishing a run in the men's skeleton event at the Beijing Games. Insider interviewed Heraskevych on Wednesday, a day after he returned to Kyiv after competing in Beijing, where he placed 18th in the skeleton. ""The streets are more empty, people are really nervous,"" he told Insider. ""It's a little bit changed."" For months, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been ramping up troops along the Ukrainian border while claiming to have no plans to invade, but Western leaders in recent weeks have warned that Moscow could launch an attack at any moment. Putin has blamed the contentious situation on NATO, complaining about the alliance's eastward expansion. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but has sought to join for years. Russia sees the prospect of Ukrainian NATO membership as an existential threat. Along these lines, Moscow has made demands for binding security guarantees from the West — including permanently barring Ukraine from NATO. But the alliance and the US have refused to bend on this demand, maintaining that NATO's open door policy will not change. Putin announced on Tuesday that he was pulling back some troops on the border, but Heraskevych said the mood in Ukraine has definitely changed since he left to compete at the Olympics. The 23-year-old physics student said he spent most of the winter out of the country, training and competing, but he came back to Ukraine right before the Olympics to isolate before the Games. But upon returning to Ukraine after the Games, he told Insider that the streets were emptier than the last time he was home. Competing in the Olympics was especially stressful for Heraskevych because he had to leave his mother behind in Ukraine on her own. Heraskevych's father is his coach, so he came with him to Beijing. Heraskevych said he tried to ""stay professional"" and focus on his runs during the Games, but admitted that it was ""really hard"" to tune out the news. Since returning to Ukraine, he said most people seem unsure about what to expect in the coming days. But Heraskevych is still hopeful a war might be avoided. When asked whether he was worried about how Putin might interpret his anti-war protest, Heraskevych told Insider it wasn't meant to be a criticism of any one country's actions, but a call for peace. ""I only want peace in my country,"" he said. ""I hope this call for peace will help our situation and ... show that we are normal people who want to live their best lives, to set some goals and to achieve them,"" he added. ""We are not people who want war, we are a kind people, a kind nation, who want to live a good life.""
