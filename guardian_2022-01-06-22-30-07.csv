1/6/2022,"The Conservative peer Michelle Mone is being investigated by the Metropolitan police for an allegedly racist message she is accused of sending to a man of Indian heritage. The recipient of the message, Richard Lynton-Jones, complained to the police last summer that during a disagreement following a fatal yacht collision in 2019, Lady Mone told him in a WhatsApp message he was “a waste of a man’s white skin”.  Lynton-Jones gave a statement to the police in October, providing screenshots of the messages. He is understood to have told the police in his statement that he believed Mone racially attacked him by using those words in the message, that he found it grossly offensive and felt harassed, alarmed and distressed by it. The alleged contents of WhatsApp messages, in which Mone also allegedly described Lynton-Jones’s partner as a “mental loony” and “nut case bird”, were revealed by the Guardian last month. Mone has repeatedly denied she is racist and her lawyers have questioned the authenticity of the messages. In screenshots of the messages seen by the Guardian, Mone appears to accuse Lynton-Jones and his partner of showing insufficient respect following the yacht crash off Monaco, in which a crew member was killed – an accusation they reject. The WhatsApp screenshots show the Tory peer responding after Lynton-Jones told her to back off, writing: “Your [sic] a low life, a waste of a mans [sic] white skin so don’t give us your lies. Your [sic] a total disgrace.” The Metropolitan police confirmed they were investigating. “In June 2021 police received an allegation of a racially aggravated malicious communication in relation to information posted on a messaging app,” they said in a statement. “Police spoke to the complainant and advised that for the investigation to progress a statement would need to be taken; for this to be admissible in any future court proceedings, this would need to be done in person. ”In October, the complainant gave a statement to police and the investigation continues. A 50-year-old woman has been invited to attend for an interview under caution at a future date.” Mone is understood to have been scheduled to be interviewed under caution on 23 December, but that appointment was reportedly delayed. The police declined to say when the interview was now scheduled to happen. When the Guardian first reported on the allegedly racist message, a representative of Mone initially said: “Baroness Mone is 100% not a racist. Baroness Mone and her husband have built over 15 schools in Africa in the past three years.” Her lawyers later provided another statement in which they said Mone had “no access” to the messages and no “detailed memory of them”. “She is not prepared to comment on the messages unless and until their authenticity has been confirmed but Baroness Mone, in any event, very strongly denies that she is a racist, a sexist or that she has a lack of respect for those persons genuinely suffering with mental health difficulties.” In separate correspondence, her lawyers also said their client believed at the time that the man had “no trace whatsoever of non-white colouring or any features” that would suggest he was not “100% white and British”. In a subsequent post on Instagram, Mone denied the WhatsApp message was racist, saying: “Since when did calling out a man on his actions after a manslaughter and his entitled white privilege constitute racism?” A lawyer for Mone indicated to the Guardian that Mone’s Instagram post did not suggest she now accepted that she sent the message. It has since been reported that Lynton-Jones has started libel proceedings against Mone, accusing her of defamation. Mone is reported to have said to friends she will vigorously defend any action. It is understood that there has been no finding of manslaughter following the yacht crash, and that part of the investigation has been closed.",News/UK news,Met investigating Tory peer Michelle Mone over ‘racist message’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/met-investigating-tory-peer-michelle-mone-over-racist-message
1/6/2022,"Hospitals outside London could end up treating even more Covid patients than at the peak of the pandemic last January, a senior NHS leader has warned. Soaring infection rates in the north of England mean that one NHS trust expects to have 30% more Covid cases next week than it had at the previous peak in cases last January, the chief executive of NHS Providers said.  Chris Hopson fears that hospitals outside the capital will not be as able to cope as those in London with the new wave of admissions currently unfolding there. That is because they have deeper staffing problems, higher levels of sickness absence, older populations and in some cases worse social care provision, he said. NHS Providers represents all the 213 NHS trusts of different sorts in England. Drawing a contrast between the ability of trusts in London and the rest of England to withstand the intense pressures of Omicron, Hopson said in a series of tweets that, in the bulk of the country, “overall Covid cases v previous peaks could be much higher”. NEW thread 5 Jan. SUMMARY. NHS stretched like never before. London still showing lower hospitalisation growth. But growing concerns that the assumption the rest of country will match London pattern may be wrong. Also must recognise impact of pressure on patients & staff. 1/24 He added: “London currently [circa] 50% of Jan 2021 peak Covid hospital load. One northern trust already at 70% of Jan 2021 peak and predicting [circa] 130% next week.” Some trusts outside London have as many as 19% of their staff absent because of Covid, much higher than the 10% off sick or isolating that other NHS organisations have been reporting, he added. Hopson posted his tweets on Wednesday evening after speaking to chief executives of “more than a dozen” trusts outside London over the previous 24 hours. “They all, unanimously, challenged the assumption that the rest of the country will automatically follow London on the shape and scale of, and ability to ‘cope’ with, pressure,” he said. He added: “CEOs outside London gave a number of reasons why their local system may be less able to cope with pressures than London has done. Demographics, patterns of infection, hospitalisation and sickness absence will be different. “So we are likely to see a very varied pattern emerging over next days and weeks, with some trusts finding it easier to ‘cope’ than others. With London trusts at ‘more able to cope’ end? Hence why some trusts now declaring critical incidents – around two dozen now.” Listing other issues that hamper non-London trusts, he said: “Several saying they’ve started with higher bed occupancy (both Covid and non-Covid) than many London trusts. Multiple workforce issues. Ability to access agency and bank shifts more difficult outside London. Especially outside urban areas. “Many trusts, for example some offering full set of services across multiple sites, already had workforce gaps pre-Covid so [are] less resilient when absences strike. Geography and distance to travel make staff redeployment across sites more difficult.” Older populations, the difficulty of redeploying staff to sites where they do not usually work and fewer agency staff living locally affect trusts serving rural areas, he added. All the 24 trusts that have declared an “internal critical incident” in recent days have been outside London. Several operate more than one hospital across a wide area with a small population, such as the Morecambe Bay and United Lincolnshire trusts. Others serve coastal and rural areas, such as those in Blackpool, Plymouth and Dorset. The entire NHS in Norfolk has also gone on alert. Hopson said the NHS across England is “stretched like never before”. He urged politicians and NHS leaders to “openly and clearly acknowledge scale of current pressures and impact on patients and staff”. Despite their best efforts to maintain normal care, some trusts are having to again postpone non-urgent operations because of the pressure they are under. That, combined with long waits for ambulances to arrive and to access A&E care, is leading to a “clear, regrettable impact on quality of care for patients”, he added.",News/World news,Hospitals outside London ‘expect more Covid patients than last January’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/hospitals-outside-london-expect-more-covid-patients-than-last-january
1/6/2022,"Claims by a Spanish government minister that factory farming is damaging the environment and leading to the export of poor-quality meat have provoked a furious backlash after his comments were published in the Guardian. In an interview published on Boxing Day, Alberto Garzón, the minister for consumer affairs, defended traditional grazing “as an environmentally sustainable means of cattle farming”.  “That is sustainable; what isn’t at all sustainable is these so-called mega-farms,” he said. “They find a village in a depopulated bit of Spain and put in 4,000, or 5,000 or 10,000 head of cattle. They pollute the soil, they pollute the water and then they export this poor-quality meat from these ill-treated animals.” Garzón is the coordinator of the United Left party, a junior member of the coalition government led by prime minister Pedro Sánchez’s centre-left Socialist Workers party (PSOE). His remarks have provoked outrage from the meat industry, opposition politicians and from senior members of the PSOE, forcing the government to distance itself from his comments. Isabel Rodríguez, the government spokesperson, insisted that Garzón was speaking in a personal capacity. She added that the livestock industry was “an absolute priority” for the government and praised the “extremely high quality” of its produce. Far from contrite, Garzón rejected the claim that he was speaking on his own behalf. “What I said, I said as the minister of consumer affairs. There’s no other way of seeing it,” he said a radio interview with Cadena Ser, adding that his comments were “flawless”. “I’m not saying anything new,” he told the station. “I’m just relaying what scientists say. Everyone knows that the factory farming of meat causes pollution … and emits greenhouse gases. Europe has brought a case against Spain over the excessive level of nitrate pollution.” Garzón also pointed out that while the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition recommends people eat between 200g and 500g of meat a week, the average Spaniard consumes more than 1kg. Pedro Barato, the president of the Asaja agricultural association, accused Garzón of irresponsible behaviour and called for his resignation. “The Spanish livestock industry depends on exports to survive,” he said. “You can’t send out this sort of message in the international press.” Álvaro Mateos Amann, the president of the Basque veterinary association in Vizcaya, also demanded Garzón’s resignation, saying that the comments by what he called the “pseudo-minister” were another demonstration of “the poor quality of our political representatives and their lack of respect for the livestock sector”. The centre-right Citizens party said in a statement that “in a single paragraph” Garzón had caused “irremediable” damage to Spain’s livestock industry while Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People’s party, said it was “unacceptable that the government should tell the international press that Spain exports poor-quality meat from ill-treated animals”. A report published in October claimed that intensive pork farming probably played a major role in one of Spain’s biggest environmental disasters that led to the death of thousands of fish in the Mar Menor, a saltwater lagoon in south-east Spain. Scientists blame decades of nitrate-laden runoffs from the farms for triggering vast blooms of algae that deplete the water of oxygen, causing the fish to suffocate underwater. According to government figures, in 2021 there were 32 million pigs in Spain, in addition to seven million cows and 15 million sheep and goats. Garzón was previously attacked in July for urging Spaniards to reduce their meat consumption. “This doesn’t mean that we can’t have a family barbecue from time to time, just that we do it with a bit more restraint,” he said. “Eating too much meat is bad for our health and for the planet.”",News/World news,Spanish minister under fire after ‘mega-farm’ claims in Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/spanish-minister-under-fire-after-mega-farm-claims-in-guardian
1/6/2022,"The National Theatre has cancelled the official opening night for the current run of its major festive musical Hex, which has been “blighted by Covid”, said its director and lyricist, Rufus Norris. Hex, a new version of Sleeping Beauty, began preview performances in the Olivier theatre in December and company illnesses meant that almost every performance in its first week had a different combination of understudies and stand-ins, said Norris in a statement on Thursday. Three weeks of performances were then lost due to illness. The original press night was set for 15 December then postponed to 21 December and then postponed again.  “We had hoped to emerge into a clearer situation in January,” continued Norris, who is also the National’s artistic director, “but while we have started performances again, fresh cases are still emerging and the creative team have had to disperse to other projects.” The planned NT Live broadcast has been cancelled. Hex will end, as planned, on 22 January but the National has announced that it will restage the musical in November “to give it the chance to have a full run” and an official opening night. Norris said that “it will take us a long while to understand the full and ongoing impact of Covid, and we will no doubt be in a state of constant adaptation for some time yet”. Last month, the National also cancelled performances of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at Troubadour Wembley Park theatre. Over the Christmas period, productions around the UK were beset by last-minute cancellations and postponements caused by Covid-related absences in what is usually theatre’s most profitable period. The new West End musical Moulin Rouge! has also postponed its opening night more than once due to Covid. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical, Cinderella, has suspended performances until next month to “avoid more disruption and to protect the quality of the show we give our audiences” after the impact of the Omicron variant. On Tuesday it was announced that this year’s Vault festival, the London fringe spectacular comprising 600 shows, has been cancelled. It was due to start later this month. In December, a highlights audio recording for Hex, billed as a “mythic, big-hearted musical”, was released. Hex stars Rosalie Craig and has music by Jim Fortune and a book by Tanya Ronder whose plays include Dara and who is married to Norris. It has been an unprecedented time in theatre, added Norris, who said “I certainly have never made a production without an opening night”.

1/6/2022,"More than 40,000 people worldwide have been treated with the drug olaparib for ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. On its approval for use by drug regulators in 2014, it became the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors that kill cancer cells by undermining their ability to repair damage to their DNA. In one clinical trial, almost half of women whose advanced ovarian cancers contained mutations in one of two genes – BRCA1 and BRCA2 – saw no deterioration of their disease five years after being given olaparib. That compares with one in five (48.3% vs 20.5%) for those given a placebo.  Olaparib is a very British success story. It is also one that shows how charities play a bigger role in the development of new medicines than many people realise. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) funded much of the basic research behind olaparib in Cambridge and London, and helped set up a biotech company to develop it, before it was commercialised as Lynparza by the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. “Without funding from charities like CRUK, there would be no olaparib today,” says Chris Lord, professor of cancer genomics and deputy director of the Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins Research Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, who helped demonstrate the drug’s potential. Top: BRCA2, a human gene and its protein product. Certain variations of the BRCA2 gene increase risks for breast cancer; below: Prof Steve Jackson Olaparib’s origins lie in the 1960s when scientists began piecing together how cells repair damage caused to their DNA by things such as metabolic reactions and exposure to sunlight. The Swedish biochemist Tomas Lindahl, funded from 1981 by one of the two charities that later merged to become CRUK, was jointly awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry for his work on DNA repair in 2015. In 1992, Lindahl co-authored a paper in Nature that identified an enzyme called poly-ADP ribose phosphorylase, or PARP, as a key component of a cell’s DNA repair system, kick-starting research into how the enzyme worked. It was a field that Steve Jackson, the biologist whose research led to olaparib, found himself exploring through what could be called a scientific twist of fate. During his research on gene transcription, the process through which DNA is copied to produce the instructions to make proteins, he discovered proteins that only became activated in the presence of DNA. Follow-up work revealed that they became activated in response to DNA breakages, suggesting they were part of a cell’s DNA repair system. Jackson, now professor of biology at the University of Cambridge and head of CRUK’s laboratories at the Gurdon Institute, knew that chemo and radiotherapy worked partly due to cancer cells’ increased susceptibility to DNA damage. He wondered whether targeting their ability to repair this damage, by, for example, finding drugs that could block DNA repair activity, would enhance the effects of existing cancer therapies. Others however, weren’t convinced. DNA repair defends the body against cancer. “I approached pharmaceutical companies and venture capital groups, but there was no interest,” says Jackson. “They thought my reasoning was counterintuitive. Why would you inhibit something which protects us against cancer?” He was, however, not alone in his thinking. Researchers at Newcastle University were similarly working to target DNA repair enzymes to enhance existing cancer therapies – in this case, PARP, the enzyme highlighted by Tomas Lindahl in 1992. Faced with the same concerns from potential investors over the risks of tampering with DNA repair processes, both groups turned for support to the charity sector, and to the Cancer Research Campaign – one of the organisations that later merged into CRUK. With its advice and funding, Jackson set up KuDOS Pharmaceuticals in 1997. Key to its business plan was the concept of “synthetic lethality”. This is the idea that, when a cancer cell contains defects in a particular process, it often becomes reliant on a second “back-up” process to survive – making this second process very sensitive to targeting with drugs. “It’s like chopping one leg off a four-legged table,” says Jackson. “The table will wobble but still just about stay upright. But if you chop off another leg … that’s it. No more table.” KuDOS began identifying compounds to block the activity of DNA repair enzymes including PARP. Following a chance late-night meeting in a bar at a conference, Jackson began a collaboration with Prof Alan Ashworth, an expert in the BRCA genes and associated cancers at the Institute of Cancer Research, London. The BRCA genes had been identified only a few years earlier, with researchers funded by the Cancer Research Campaign playing a prominent role. BRCA genes are involved in DNA repair – so if a person inherits faulty, mutated BRCA genes it increases their risk of cancer, especially ovarian and breast cancer. Ashworth’s team, with funding from CRUK, had been working to find ways to kill BRCA mutant tumour cells while sparing healthy cells. Joining forces, Ashworth and Jackson decided to see what happened when BRCA-mutated cells were exposed to KuDOS’s new DNA repair-blocking compounds – including one that targeted PARP. “It was exciting; a bit of a eureka moment,” says Jackson. “The BRCA-deficient cells dropped dead and the normal ones were fine.” KuDOS swiftly started a clinical trial of this compound, which would later become olaparib, with positive early data leading to the company’s purchase by AstraZeneca in 2005. Regulators in the US and Europe approved olaparib, sold as Lynparza, to treat women with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancers, which had stopped responding to standard therapies, in 2014, and later against some breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Meanwhile the Newcastle group, also backed by CRUK, developed their own PARP inhibitor drug, rucaparib, now sold under the name Rubraca, and approved to treat some ovarian cancers. Top: CRUK chief executive Michelle Mitchell; below: a scientist conducting the process of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA by using a thermocycler Unfortunately, tumours can develop resistance to treatments – even sophisticated, targeted drugs such as PARP inhibitors. In 2008, Ashworth’s group showed that BRCA2-mutated cancer cells, unexpectedly, could “reverse” these mutations, reactivating their defective DNA repair systems and so becoming insensitive to PARP inhibitors. Many other mechanisms of resistance to the drugs have since been discovered. Lord has spent many years working to find ways to prevent resistance to PARP inhibitors, and to treat patients in whom that develops. In June, he published details of a prototype drug that could block the activity of a DNA repair enzyme called POLQ, and so shrink BRCA-mutated tumours in rats. Early research suggests it can target cancers that are resistant to PARP inhibitors. Lord’s group has also shown how a similar approach can be used to tackle tumours with defects in DNA repair genes other than BRCA, including two called ARID1A and E-cadherin. “The original work on PARP inhibitors helped us to see how we can use synthetic lethality to target cancers that don’t have BRCA mutations, by exploiting other vulnerabilities,” he says. Beyond inspiring scientists to find new treatment targets, the olaparib story also highlights the lesser-known roles charities play in driving improvements for patients. “We have a unique part to play because we’re driven by patient benefit rather than profit,” says Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of CRUK. “Based on our expertise, we can back promising but risky science without the need to think about shareholder value.” Charities are well placed to bridge the gap between university researchers making potentially life-saving discoveries and pharmaceutical companies that are reluctant to back innovations that have limited chances of big returns. “Without the initial funding, we would have been unable to do the basic science or to then get over the barriers to setting up a company,” says Jackson. “Without CRUK, we would not have olaparib.” Some cancer charities have become better at making use of commercial opportunities that arise from their funding roles. Obtaining patents makes returns on investments and attracting commercial partners possible. More than 60 companies have been started based on CRUK-funded research. The charity currently has more than 30 drugs in clinical and preclinical development, and has supported 11 drugs to market through commercial partnerships. Between 2013 and 2017, CRUK also licensed more oncology intellectual property (IP) than any organisation in the world other than the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston. This more commercial focus is paying dividends. The charity’s income from intellectual property and royalties, including from olaparib and rucaparib, rose from £62m in 2015 to £100m in 2019. One of CRUK’s key ambitions is to increase the proportion of people surviving their cancer in the UK from around half in 2010 to three-quarters in 2034. Its growing commercial success is making this more likely thanks to a virtuous circle which sees profits from drug sales being ploughed back into funding research to find new treatments. “Supporting entrepreneurship, commercialisation and protecting intellectual property generated through the research we fund are important parts of how we can improve cancer survival and outcomes,” says Mitchell, pointing out that PARP inhibitors are transforming treatment for many patients with cancer. “Thanks to our IP, the story of these drugs gets even better as we get royalties from its sales which we can then reinvest in new research.” To find out more about Cancer Research UK’s work, visit cruk.org, or to donate and fund more life-saving discoveries, go to cruk.org/donate",Cancer revolutionaries,The cancer drug that turned scientific thinking on its head – and became a very British success story,https://www.theguardian.com/cancer-revolutionaries/2022/jan/06/the-cancer-drug-that-turned-scientific-thinking-on-its-head-and-became-a-very-british-success-story
1/6/2022,"The former Scottish National party MP Margaret Ferrier will stand trial in August accused of travelling from Glasgow to London in September 2020 knowing she had symptoms of coronavirus and wilfully exposing others to the risk of infection. Ferrier pleaded not guilty to the single charge on Thursday morning at Glasgow sheriff court.  The Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP, who referred herself to the police and the parliamentary commissioner for standards , was immediately suspended from her party after the alleged rule-breaking came to light. She has clung to her position despite vociferous and ongoing calls for her to quit, including from the first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon. Prosecutors allege Ferrier “culpably and recklessly” put people at risk, making several journeys after having been told to self-isolate between 26 and 29 September 2020. The charge claims she wilfully exposed people to “the risk of infection, illness and death”, travelling throughout Glasgow and the surrounding areas as well as making journeys to and from London. Over three days, the 61-year-old is alleged to have visited a variety of local businesses and other locations within her constituency and beyond, including Lifestyle Leisure Centre, Vanilla Salon and Sweet P Boutique in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, St Mungo’s church in Glasgow and Vic’s bar in Prestwick, Ayrshire. The trial date was set for 15 August, with the case expected to last for four or five days, and a pre-trial hearing set for June.

1/6/2022,"Vivian Li likes to grow things. Apart from cultivating vegetables and caring for her chickens, she’s been nurturing “mini-organs” – tiny versions of organs derived from a patient’s own stem cells – in her lab at the Francis Crick Institute in London. These cultures, known as organoids, mimic the way the tissues of a specific organ behave so that scientists can try to unravel the evolution of diseases, carry out drug research and refine personalised medicine.  Crucial to the field of organoids is the ability of stem cells to develop into almost any kind of cell in the body, becoming muscle cells, brain cells or a variety of other cells. Using these, researchers can grow tissues and organ structures – organoids – giving them the ability to study how the organs actually function. Li, a stem cell scientist investigating the healthy gut and bowel cancer, first worked on organoids in the Netherlands at the Hubrecht Institute for Developmental Biology and Stem Cell Research under Prof Hans Clevers, one of the original architects of the diminutive structures. She had made a beeline for the Clevers Lab in 2008 after wrapping up a PhD focused on bowel cancer in her native Hong Kong. The following year, the Clevers Lab, in Utrecht, created its first iteration of an organoid: a mini-gut. The advances came thick and fast after that, with researchers crafting a range of other mini-organs, including a liver, pancreas, bladder, and tear glands capable of “crying”. The Clevers team even graduated from mammals to reptiles, successfully growing snake venom glands. But given her previous work on cancer, Li was especially interested in the bowel, and eager to take this strand of work forward. So, in 2013, she moved to the UK and set up her own lab at the Francis Crick Institute, growing mini-guts with the ability to digest nutrients and secrete mucus in a bid to solve an assortment of medical challenges. The Crick is the ideal environment for this – collaborative, multidisciplinary, open. Cancer Research UK (CRUK), along with other key funders, supports more than 90 research groups, including Li’s lab, at the Crick – the largest biomedical research institute under one roof in Europe. As well as having raised £100m through its “Create the Change” campaign to help build the institute, CRUK invests around £50m each year so that the Crick can offer researchers such as Li reliable, ongoing core funding. This mitigates some of the pressure of applying for grants, allowing them to make ambitious long-term plans and pursue demanding research that will shape the future of human health. One of Li’s projects – in collaboration with the Great Ormond Street children’s hospital – involves work that could one day lead to the generation of organs for children with small-intestine failure who require transplants; at present this procedure is limited by a scarcity of donors, the risk of rejection and other complications. Early research has demonstrated that it is possible to grow a small piece of functional gut in the lab using a sick child’s own stem cells, raising the possibility of eventually scaling up to grow a larger segment of functional intestine. But it’s not only healthy tissue that can be grown into mini-organs. A tumour surgically removed from a cancer patient can provide the raw material to grow a mini-tumour in a dish. This can then be used to screen drugs to which the mini-tumour – and thus, in theory, the patient it came from – might be sensitive, says Li. The hope is that, one day, this might be used in real time, to find personalised treatment strategies for individual patients. A key longer-term avenue of research is an internal network of proteins that signal inside stem cells, keeping them growing and multiplying, known as the Wnt signalling pathway. Overzealous Wnt signals are thought to be responsible for many bowel cancers, triggering stem cells to proliferate furiously and form tumours. However, as the pathway is also integral to a healthy stem cell population, broadly targeting it would create new problems. Instead, Li’s lab has honed in on what appear to be tumour-specific targets on the pathway. “It usually takes decades to develop a drug. We’re nowhere near that, but finding a target is already a big step,” says Li. This research all came to a standstill when the pandemic hit, with the lab being forced to pause all activity. Undeterred, by day Li locked down with her young children (aged three and five), growing chillies, broccoli, tomatoes and courgettes. At night, between 10pm and 2am, she worked on papers chronicling insights from her work. The thing about starting her own lab, she says, is that much of her work is now computer based, with her time taken up reviewing grants and fellowship applications as well as writing papers. “You actually have to suddenly turn from a lab bench scientist to a manager … and an accountant as well because you have to manage your own budget.” As it happens, mathematical alchemy comes easy to Li. Her PhD experience in bioinformatics (computational tools employed to analyse swathes of biological data) was a key skill that made Li a strong candidate for the Clevers Lab. When she arrived there, Li met a cohort of confident male scientists who believed they were proficient at these complex mathematical calculations. She was better than them, says Clevers, and she felt she had to make that clear. “At one point, she basically told all of us that she was the one who knew bioinformatics and we’d better listen to her,” he says. “I remember that lab meeting, it essentially was more like a lecture … she went through the whole mathematical analysis. I think that was an interesting eye-opener for a few people in the lab.” Having just given birth to her third child, Li’s drive is undiminished. The one rule she lives by – and wants others, especially female scientists, to internalise – is to aim big, because waiting for the “right time” in terms of career and/or family goals can result in missed opportunities. In her experience of recruiting scientists, women are missing out on opportunities to take leadership roles because fewer put themselves forward, “yet at the PhD or postdoctoral level, applications are kind of evenly split, if not more women sometimes”. She adds: “You can always say: ‘Oh, I’ll do it after I’ve met this deadline, or maybe I’ll get to it next year,’ but, in fact, it will never be the right time – that’s what I’ve learned over the years. So do it now.” To find out more about the researchers that Cancer Research UK funds, visit cruk.org/our-research, or to donate to this life-saving work, go to cruk.org",Cancer revolutionaries,Stem cell research: meet the scientist growing ‘mini guts’ in her lab,https://www.theguardian.com/cancer-revolutionaries/2022/jan/06/stem-cell-research-meet-the-scientist-growing-mini-guts-in-her-lab
1/6/2022,"The boss of one of the UK’s fastest-growing energy suppliers has said Britain must find £20bn to rein in soaring household bills that have compounded fears about a cost-of-living crisis in 2022. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said his company did not know yet how much bills would rise in the run-up to 7 February, the deadline for when the regulator Ofgem sets a new cap on what suppliers can charge customers.  The record wholesale gas prices across Europe has led to forecasts that average annual bills in the UK could leap from £1,277 to more than £2,000 when the cap comes into effect in April. Jackson said talks between energy suppliers and the government would have to find a way to avoid global gas prices being passed directly on to consumers. “We’ve got to recognise that as a result of the pandemic, every sector is asking the Treasury for help and there’s not an infinite supply of money,” he said. “The reality is that the UK buys most of its energy on a global market and we’ve had to pay about £20bn more than usual this year. So, in some way or another, the UK is going to have to pay that money.” Octopus, a renewable energy provider, is one of the fastest-growing companies in the sector, with 3.1m customers. It has been at the heart of industry talks with business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who is said to be determined to avoid bailing out large energy companies. Jackson has been a leading proponent of an alternative £20bn loan scheme, under which a commercial lender makes a fund available that suppliers can dip into in order to refrain from hitting customers with sudden hikes in their energy bills. The suppliers could then pay the lender back over time with the money they make from staggered price increases, cushioning the blow to household finances. Jackson said the sector should explore the plan, which may need government oversight but not necessarily any state funding, “before we go looking for help from the public purse or elsewhere”. “The energy sector has always had large access to private finance,” he added. Asked whether a windfall tax should be imposed on North Sea oil companies that have made money from higher gas prices to help fund lower bills, Jackson refused to dismiss the idea. He added that it should be separate from broader efforts to reduce household bills. The expectation of rising gas bills adds to wider fears that 2022 will be characterised by a massive squeeze on the cost of living that could push more people into poverty and upend British politics. UK households face a hit of £1,200 this year, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, with more expensive energy bills piled on top of rising taxes and the effect of stalling wage increases.",News/Business,Energy boss says UK must find £20bn to ease soaring household bills,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/06/octopus-ceo-uk-20bn-household-bills-loan-scheme
1/6/2022,"The BBC has hired ITN’s chief executive to lead its news coverage, at a time when the broadcaster is struggling with substantial budget cuts and facing scrutiny over the impartiality of its coverage. Deborah Turness will inherit a newsroom that is halfway through an unpopular two-year restructuring process and has lost hundreds of experienced staff through redundancies and relocations. Its audience remains enormous across the UK and abroad but it is struggling with the transition away from traditional broadcasting formats and is regularly used as punchbag by politicians.  Turness said that in an era of digital growth and innovation the BBC’s global reach gave it an edge. She said: “In the UK and around the world there has never been a greater need for the BBC’s powerful brand of impartial, trusted journalism.” She will be paid £400,000 a year – £60,000 a year more than her predecessor, Fran Unsworth. Her job title has also been upgraded from director of news to CEO of BBC News. Her background as an on-the-ground television producer could be helpful when working alongside the BBC director general, Tim Davie, who has no experience making programmes. Turness made her name during a decade-long stint as editor of ITV News, before moving to New York in 2013 to run the sprawling NBC News operation. The first woman to run a major US news network, she faced internal opposition as she dealt with the scandal over NBC host Brian Williams exaggerating claims about his experiences in Iraq. After four years in that job she returned to London to oversee two NBC-backed television channels that struggled to gain traction – a relaunch of Euronews and an abandoned plan to set up an international-focused version of Sky News. Last year Turness returned to ITN – who make news programmes for ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 – as chief executive, in what was perceived by many staff as a homecoming. Nevertheless, Davie persuaded her to jump ship and shape the future of the public broadcaster’s news operation – seeing off competition from internal BBC candidates such as Jonathan Munro and Jamie Angus. Her start date has yet to be confirmed but Turness’s first significant domestic decisions are likely to include finding a replacement for Laura Kuenssberg as political editor and managing the ongoing rotation of prominent on-air presenters. She will also have to work out whether any parts of the BBC’s news output will have to be shut down in order to meet looming budget cuts caused by years of below-inflation licence fee settlements. Any cuts are likely to cause anger among audiences and politicians, at the same time as the corporation tries to work out how to attract younger audiences who increasingly get their news from elsewhere. There are also ongoing issues around the BBC’s attempts to define impartiality in the modern media environment, with internal and external disputes over everything from coverage of transgender issues to Westminster politics and devolution matters.",News/Media,BBC News hires ITN’s Deborah Turness as chief executive,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/06/bbc-news-hires-itn-deborah-turness-chief-executive
