3/5/2022,"By Marcy de Luna HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil slid 2% on Thursday, after hitting prices not seen in a decade, as sellers jumped on hopes the United States and Iran will agree soon on a nuclear deal that could add barrels to a tight global market. Trade was volatile, with crude prices jumping early to multi-year highs on worries about disruption to Russia's exports, which at 4 to 5 million barrels per day (bpd) are more than any other nation other than Saudi Arabia. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, companies are shunning Russian supply and scrambling for barrels elsewhere. Oil markets are in an ""explosive mood” over increasing outrage against Russia, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. “People in the world don't want to deal with a country that is committing these atrocities in Ukraine.” Brent futures were down $2.47, or 2.2%, to $110.46 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $2.93, or 2.6%, to $107.67. Both benchmarks rose to multi-year highs during the session, with Brent soaring to $119.84, its highest since May 2012 and WTI hitting its highest since September 2008 at $116.57. Washington and its Western allies have imposed sanctions on Russia, but the measures have so far stopped short of targeting Russian oil and gas exports. A new round of sanctions announced by the White House on Wednesday banned export of specific refining technologies, making it harder for Russia to modernize oil refineries. Traders remain wary of Russian oil. At least 10 tankers failed to find buyers on Wednesday, market sources said. Canada said it will remove Russia and Belarus's most favored nation status as trading partners, and will provide additional military aid to Ukraine. Global benchmark Brent has jumped nearly 25% since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Brent's six-month spread hit a record high of over $21 a barrel, indicating very tight supplies. The United States and Iran have nearly completed negotiations on reviving a nuclear accord that could bring more than a million bpd of oil, or about 1% of global supply, back to the market. ""We are close to a possible deal,"" Jalina Porter, the U.S. State Department's principal deputy spokesperson, told reporters. Negotiations to revive the pact have been going on for 10 months in Vienna. On Thursday a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, showed the stock of enriched uranium amassed by Iran was in breach of its 2015 nuclear deal, with the country nearing the ability to make a nuclear bomb. The chief of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, will visit Tehran on Saturday in an effort to resolve outstanding issues. ""Grossi's trip increases the odds of the revival of the (nuclear deal) to 70% from 60%,"" consultancy Eurasia Group said, noting ""a deal is likely this month and as soon as the next several days."" That supply relief may only end up filling part of a gap left by buyers curtailing purchases of Russian oil, which accounts for about 8% of global oil exports. ""We expect that Russian oil exports will plunge by 1 million bpd from the indirect impact of sanctions and voluntary actions by companies,"" said Rystad Energy Chief Executive Jarand Rystad. ""Oil prices are likely to continue to climb – potentially beyond $130 per barrel."" The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, on Wednesday stuck to an existing plan for a gradual output rise of 400,000 bpd a month, snubbing consumer calls for more.

3/5/2022,"Comic-turned-hero Volodymyr Zelensky has survived at least three precision assassination attempts by elite hit squads since Russia’s week-old war began, according to Ukrainian officials who say his survival was all thanks to tip-offs from Russian spies. Both the Kremlin-funded Wagner group mercenaries and Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov’s kill teams have allegedly tried to kill the Ukrainian president, who is hiding out in various bunkers deep below the capital Kyiv, according to the Washington Post. The Wagner mercenaries—run by Yevgeny Prigozhin A.K.A. “Putin’s chef”—reportedly have a kill list of 24 names, including Zelensky, but were waylaid by the stalled military convoy outside of Kyiv that made it difficult for Russian special forces to secure an escape route, according to the Times of London. Ukrainian national security chief Oleksiy Danilov told a Ukrainian television network that double agents from Russia’s Federal Security Service or FSB warned them of the attempts. “I can say that we have received information from the FSB, who do not want to take part in this bloody war,” Danilov said. “And thanks to this, the Kadyrov elite group was destroyed, which came here to eliminate our president.” Still, as President Putin’s brutal battle rages on, Zelensky’s stoic resistance has lofted him to cult status, undoubtedly angering Putin whose inferiority complex seems to be tipping towards psychosis. Zelensky is now even pleading to Putin to meet face-to-face— which may seem like a death wish—but which is unlikely to happen. “I don’t bite,” Zelensky said in a statement to Putin. “What are you afraid of?” Early Friday morning, as Europe’s largest nuclear power plant smoldered under a Russian attack that turned into occupation, Zelensky made an emotional plea in a video statement accusing Russia of edging ever closer to nuclear war. “If there is an explosion, that’s the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe,” he said as world leaders reacted with shock and dismay. “Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops. Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.” Zelensky added, “No country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units. This is the first time in our history. In the history of mankind. The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror,” he said. “The Russian tanks knew that they were firing with a direct fire at the station.” The Russian military instead claimed that it was Ukrainian forces guarding the plant who fired first, provoking return fire. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemned the nuclear plant attack. “This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging good faith in diplomatic efforts,” he said Friday morning as leaders called for an emergency meeting in response to the latest wave of aggression. Ukraine’s foreign ministry warned that if the Zaporizhzhya plant melted down, it would be ten times larger than the Chernobyl disaster, which is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history. As fighting raged on across the country, Ukraine’s cultural minister ordered workers to wrap up statues and try to shore up ancient basilicas in Kyiv and Lviv, as they braced for more missiles. “Russia’s missiles and planes are deliberately destroying historic centers of big cities. Putin wants to destroy Europe's heritage and culture, wipe it from the face of the earth,” the cultural ministry said in a statement Friday. “A mad dictator threatens to destroy St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, a UNESCO church built in the 11th century.” A fierce battle was also underway in the strategic port city of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine on Friday with a constant bombardment as Russian troops encircle the city. In Zhytomyr in the north, a school was destroyed by a missile, causing it to collapse, according to CNN. NATO continues to resist Zelensky’s pleas for a no-fly zone over the country, worried that shooting down Russian jets to enforce it would only give Putin more reason to attack, potentially responding with Russia’s arsenal of nuclear weapons. “NATO will defend all its allies and territory against a Russian attack,” said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at NATO headquarters in Brussels Friday. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of NATO territory.” Ukraine, of course, is not yet part of that territory. Negotiations on Thursday led to Russia promising a limited humanitarian corridor to get supplies in and civilians out, but Zelensky on Friday expressed little faith that Russia would hold up their end of the deal. “Today we will see if the agreement works,” Zelensky said, clearly unconvinced.

3/5/2022,"As the eighth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine began Thursday morning, Russian forces appeared to have gained tactical control of their first city, the southern port city of Kherson, but Ukraine is still holding out in Mariupol, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv, despite heavy shelling. Deaths are mounting on both sides. Big explosions were heard in Kyiv overnight, but according to the British Defense Ministry's Thursday morning update, the main body of the 40-mile-long Russian military convoy advancing on the capital remains nearly 20 miles from the city center, ""having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown, and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby gave a similar prognosis on Wednesday, saying the ""stalled"" column hasn't, ""from our best estimates, made any appreciable progress in the last 24-36 hours,"" possibly because the Russians are ""regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time,"" but probably also due to ""logistics and sustainment challenges"" and ""resistance from the Ukrainians."" Trent Telenko, a retired Pentagon staff specialist and military history blogger, suggests another big reason may be Russia's tires, as he explained in a long, illustrated Twitter thread based on photos of deserted Russian Pantsir-S1 wheeled gun-missile systems and his own experience as a U.S. Army vehicle auditor. ""When you leave military truck tires in one place for months on end,"" the sidewalls get brittle in the sun and fail like the tires on the Pantsir-SR, he wrote. ""No one exercised that vehicle for one year."" Karl Muth, an economist, government adviser, and self-described ""tire expert,"" jumped in, agreeing with Telenko but adding some details about the tires. Bit of a tire expert here. Those aren't Soviet-era heavy truck radials. Chinese military tires, and I believe specifically the Yellow Sea YS20. This is a tire I first encountered in Somalia and Sudan; it's a bad Chinese copy of the excellent Michelin XZL military tire design. 🇫🇷 — Karl T. Muth 🌐✈️📊 (@KarlMuth) March 3, 2022 ""There is a huge operational level implication in this,"" Telenko said. ""If the Russian Army was too corrupt to exercise a Pantsir-S1, they were too corrupt to exercise the trucks and wheeled [armored fighting vehicles] now in Ukraine,"" meaning ""the Russians simply cannot risk them off-road during the Rasputitsa/mud season."" That is a problem for the convoy in the north, he added. ""The Crimea is a desert and the South Ukrainian coastal areas are dryer. So we are not seeing this there. But elsewhere the Russians have a huge problem for the next 4 to 6 weeks."" Read Telenko's whole thread on Twitter. The West is going after Russian oligarchs' luxury yachts.

3/5/2022,"By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukraine still has a ""significant majority"" of its military aircraft available nine days after Russian forces started their invasion of the country, a U.S. defense official said on Friday. Vastly outmatched by Russia's military, in terms of raw numbers and firepower, the fact that Ukraine's own air force is still flying and its air defenses are still deemed to be viable has surprised military experts. ""The Ukrainians still have a significant majority of their air combat power available to them, both fixed-wing and rotary wing as well as unmanned systems and surface-to-air systems,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official added that Ukrainian aircraft had suffered some loses, including being destroyed by Russian forces, but did not give details. After the opening salvos of the war on Feb. 24, analysts expected the Russian military to try to immediately destroy Ukraine's air force and air defenses. Russia has fired more than 500 missiles at Ukrainian targets since the start of the invasion, but is still flying through contested airspace. Ukrainian troops with surface-to-air rockets are able to threaten Russian aircraft and create risk to Russian pilots trying to support ground forces. Ukraine's ability to keep flying air force jets is a visible demonstration of the country's resilience in the face of attack and has been a morale booster, both to its own military and Ukraine's people, experts say. 'ANSWERED THE PHONE' The Pentagon has established a new hotline with Russia's ministry of defense to prevent ""miscalculation, military incidents and escalation"" in the region as Russia's invasion of Ukraine advances. The ""deconfliction"" hotline would be an open phone line based at the European Command's headquarters and would fall under Air Force General Tod Wolters, who leads all U.S. forces on the continent. ""In our initial test of it, (the Russians) answered the phone,"" the official said. Russian troops were still about 25 km (16 miles) away from Kyiv's city center, largely unchanged over the past few days. The official compared an Odessa scenario to Russia's assault around Mariupol, where they used an amphibious assault to the southwest using naval infantry and also came down from the north with land forces out of Donetsk. ""So one could see a scenario where that's a similar play,"" the official said. The United States cannot refute reports that Russian forces are in control of the port city of Kherson, the official said, but added the United States could not confirm the takeover. Tanks entered Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.

3/5/2022,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian police have seized a yacht owned by Alexey Mordashov, the richest man in Russia before being blacklisted this week by the European Union following Moscow's attack on Ukraine, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday. The 65-metre (215-ft) ""Lady M"" was impounded in the northern Italian port of Imperia, the source said. A second yacht owned by Gennady Timchenko, another billionaire who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is also blocked in Imperia and will be sequestered shortly, the source added. The move followed similar seizures in France and Germany this week of yachts belonging to other Russian oligarchs, as Western states implement massive sanctions, including asset freezes, to try to force Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. According to Italian media, Lady M was built by U.S. shipbuilders Palmer Johnson in 2013. Forbes magazine says it is worth $27 million. Mordashov built his wealth around the Russian steel producer Severstal. Taking into account the assets of his whole family, Forbes estimates that Mordashov had an estimated net worth of $29.1 billion before sanctions hit, making him the richest man in Russia. Italian media says he owns a villa worth some 66 million euros ($72 million) on the coast of the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. It was not immediately clear if that property had yet been seized by police. Timchenko made a fortune in oil trading and has been described by Putin as one of his closest associates. Britain said last month that he was a major shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which played a role in the destabilisation of Ukraine after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.

3/5/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Shell Plc, Europe’s largest oil company, bought a cargo of Russia’s flagship crude at a record discount, underscoring the company’s decision to keep buying supplies from the country after its invasion of Ukraine.

The cargo has been bought on a delivered basis, meaning Shell won’t need to sort out transportation. Shell is continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The company is in discussion with governments and will comply with any changes in regulations, the person said. In a series of Twitter posts on Friday, the company said it’s buying Russian supplies to maintain fuel deliveries to its customers, and that Shell will reduce purchases as alternative crudes become available. The decision is a pivotal moment for the oil market. Governments so far haven’t banned Russian oil and gas, wary of the price surge that such a step would cause. The purchase by Shell, which is also one of the world’s largest oil traders, may be seen as a symbolic act by the rest of the market. The trade is the first such deal in a window organized by S&P Global Platts since Russia invaded Ukraine. While it underscores the deep discounts Russia is going to have to sell its oil at, it’s also the first indication that it will still find some willing buyers in companies that are reliant on Urals crude. Rosneft, the Russian oil giant, is in the throes of trying to complete a huge tender to sell crude. The company is tendering for the sale of as much as 83 million barrels of Urals from April to October. Shell’s purchase is unrelated to that, but it will also give a sense of the price of Russian oil following the invasion. Urals has been available for purchase at deeper and deeper discounts to Dated Brent ever since the invasion and, until Friday, had not attracted bidders.

3/5/2022,"By Kiyoshi Takenaka, David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the Quad grouping of countries - the United States, India, Australia and Japan - agreed on Thursday that what is happening to Ukraine should not be allowed to happen in the Indo-Pacific, the prime ministers of Japan and Australia said. A virtual meeting of the four-country grouping was held at a time of increased concern about Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by China that has stepped up its alert level since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, wary of Beijing taking advantage of a distracted West to move against it. ""We've agreed that unilateral changes to the status quo with force like this should not be allowed in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, referring to Russia's invasion. ""We've also agreed this development makes it even more important to work toward realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Kishida told reporters after the meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""We cannot allow what is happening in Ukraine now to ever happen in the Indo-Pacific,"" Morrison said in a statement after the meeting. ""We are resolute in our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region where smaller states do not need to live in fear of more powerful ones,"" he added. A joint Quad statement said the leaders met to ""reaffirm their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, in which the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states is respected and countries are free from military, economic, and political coercion."" The leaders, whose call followed a meeting of their foreign ministers in Australia last month, also ""reaffirmed their dedication to the Quad as a mechanism to promote regional stability and prosperity."" The statement, which added that the leaders agreed to meet in person in Tokyo ""in the coming months,"" made no specific mention of Taiwan, but said the leaders discussed the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. ""They agreed to stand up a new humanitarian assistance and disaster relief mechanism which will enable the Quad to meet future humanitarian challenges in the Indo-Pacific and provide a channel for communication as they each address and respond to the crisis in Ukraine,"" it said. Biden tweeted that the meeting with the Quad leaders covered ""our commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific."" Taiwan's representative office in Washington said it welcomed the Quad’s commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. ""Taiwan will continue to work with all peace-loving partners in the region for prosperity and stability,"" it said. Modi ""underlined that the Quad must remain focused on its core objective of promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,"" his office said. It said developments in Ukraine were discussed, including its humanitarian implications, and Modi ""emphasised the need to return to a path of dialogue and diplomacy."" Washington sees the Quad and its growing relations with India as essential to its efforts to push back against China, but it is in a delicate balancing act with New Delhi, given the latter’s long-standing ties with Russia. Of the Quad countries, only India has not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is the main supplier of arms to the Indian military, and India faces the possibility of U.S. sanctions for its purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense system. Analysts say any moves by U.S. Russia hawks to impose sanctions on India for working with Moscow could set back Quad cooperation. Donald Lu, U.S. assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told a Senate subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that Washington had been fighting a ""pitched battle"" with India in diplomatic channels to urge it to take a clear position opposed to Russian actions in Ukraine. He also said it was looking ""very closely"" at whether to the apply sanctions on India over its Russian arms deals.

3/5/2022,"Authorities in China's Shaanxi Province said they are now investigating a Chinese man for allegedly abusing his mentally ill wife and locking her in an iron cage.

The allegation was reportedly posted on WeChat by the public account Xianshidemuyang (The Look of Reality), claiming that the man, identified as Li Limin, had previously boasted about abusing his wife, Tang Xiaoyu, on his Kuaishou account.

Li’s videos on the local Tik Tok-like video-sharing app have reportedly been removed, while his account, which had over 780,000 followers, appears to have been banned on Kuaishou.

Li was reportedly a jobless man from the city of Yulin who ended up running livestreams. To allegedly make his streaming more interesting for his viewers, he shared details about how he has abused his wife. Sources claimed that in one of Li’s livestreams, he told a story about how he bound Tang to a chair for three days.

Citing a witness, Xianshidemuyang alleged that Li was seen locking his wife in an iron cage attached to the back of his motorized tricycle when he had to leave his house. Xianshidemuyang’s WeChat post also included screenshots from one of Li’s live streams which showed alleged ligature and burn marks on Tang’s body.

Li was accused of taking Tang from the side of a road in 2009, forcing her to marry him and holding her against her will since then. Unconfirmed sources who reached out to Xianshidemuyang claimed that Tang looks similar to Wang Guohong, a student from Qinghai Province who went missing in 2009.

Li allegedly bragged on Kuaishou about having a son and daughter with Tang in 2012 and 2015, respectively. He purportedly sold their daughter for 30,000 yuan (approximately $4,746) and kept their son.

Li has also been accused of causing Tang’s mental disorder since he would beat her often and confine her whenever she attempted to flee. According to an unidentified source, Li earned fame and fortune through his livestreams and his alleged work with other vloggers by “helping find missing people.”

Tang’s case came to light after a similar story was reported in late January about a video showing a mentally ill woman left in an outdoor shed with a chain tied around her neck. Authorities launched an investigation into the mother of eight after a video of her went viral and public outrage grew.

3/5/2022,"By Maksym Levin and Pavel Polityuk BORODYANKA/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine agreed on Thursday to the need for humanitarian corridors to help civilians escape Moscow's eight-day-old invasion, the first apparent progress in talks, as the United States added to Western sanctions on more oligarchs. Thousands are thought to have died or been wounded as the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two unfolds, creating 1 million refugees, hits to Russia's economy and fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades. Russian forces have continued to surround and attack Ukrainian cities, including Mariupol, the main port in the east which has been under heavy bombardment, with no water or power. Officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded. After talks at an undisclosed location, Russia said ""substantial progress"" had been made while the Ukrainian side pointed to an understanding on helping ordinary people, but not the results Kyiv had hoped for. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a temporary halt to fighting in select locations was also possible. ""That is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation,"" he said. They had also seen eye-to-eye on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. The negotiators will meet again next week, the Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted Podolyak as saying. The West has responded to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion with military support and by tightening the economic screws on the Kremlin and Russians. The fallout so far has included queues outside banks, a plunge in the value of the rouble and an exodus of foreign companies. In a sign of business unease, Russia's second-largest oil producer Lukoil called for the conflict to end as soon as possible, saying it was concerned by the ""tragic events in Ukraine."" On Thursday, the United States and Britain announced sanctions on more oligarchs, following on from EU measures. Included was Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov, the founder of mining company Metalloinvest. In Germany, his luxury yacht worth nearly $600 million was moored at a Hamburg shipyard. Hamburg's economic authority said there were no plans for the vessel to be delivered to its owner. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has also been hit with U.S. sanctions. Visa restrictions will be imposed on 19 Russian oligarchs, their family members and associates, the White House said. Sanctions have ""had a profound impact already,"" said President Joe Biden. 1 MILLION REFUGEES Kyiv and other major cities are still controlled by Ukraine but the United Nations said one million people have now fled, mainly seeking refuge in Poland and other neighbours to the west. As shelling and rockets strikes continued, the government sought more military assistance, something some countries fear could provoke Russia and escalate the conflict. ""How can partners who have not yet provided Ukraine with warplanes sleep, given children are sitting in basements under bombardment..?"" foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. The United States has warned the crisis is a threat to the rules-based order. It agreed on Thursday with India, Australia and Japan on the need to avoid a similar situation in the Indo-Pacific, where there is increased concern about China moving against Taiwan, a self-ruled island it claims. But China, which abstained in a vote to reprimand Russia at the United Nations on Wednesday, is the largest shareholder at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank which said on Thursday it was suspending all activities relating to Russia and Belarus. Only Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea voted with Russia but in Moscow, Putin brushed aside worldwide condemnation and hailed his soldiers as heroes. ""I want to say that the special military operation is proceeding strictly in line with the timetable,"" he said. Western military analysts believe a Russian battle plan that aimed for a swift advance and capture of Kyiv has faltered, forcing a change. The main assault force - a huge convoy of tanks, artillery and logistics support - has been halted for days north of Kyiv. In Washington, a U.S. defense official said Russian troops were still 25 km (16 miles) from Kyiv city centre. The official said they were also just outside Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city of 1.5 million people which has seen swathes blasted into rubble. 'GIVE ME A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL' The fate of Kherson, a southern Dnipro River port, was not clear. Russian tanks had entered on Wednesday and it was reported to have been captured. But the U.S. official said Washington believed there was still fighting and it was not ready to say it had fallen. Russia has acknowledged nearly 500 of its soldiers killed since Putin sent his troops over the border on Feb. 24. Ukraine says it has killed nearly 9,000, though this cannot be confirmed. Military analysts say Russia's columns are now confined to roads as spring thaw turns Ukrainian ground to mud. Each day the main attack force lies stuck on the highway north of Kyiv, its condition deteriorates, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Emergency services in the eastern Chernihiv region said 33 bodies had been pulled from the rubble of a Russian air strike. Earlier, governor Viacheslav Chaus said at least nine people had been killed in an air strike that hit homes and two schools. Two cargo ships came under apparent attack at Ukrainian ports. Six crew members were rescued at sea after an Estonian-owned ship exploded and sank off Odessa, and at least one crew member was killed in a blast on a Bangladeshi ship at Olvia. In Borodyanka, a town 60 km northwest of Kyiv where locals repelled a Russian assault, burnt-out hulks of Russian armour were scattered on a highway, surrounded by buildings blasted into ruins. ""They started shooting from their APC towards the park in front of the post office,"" a man said in the apartment where he was sheltering with his family, referring to a Russian armoured personnel carrier. ""Then those bastards started the tank and started shooting into the supermarket which was already burned. It caught fire again. An old man ran outside like crazy, with big round eyes, and said 'give me a Molotov cocktail! I just set their APC on fire!'""

3/5/2022,"By Andrew Hay (Reuters) - A former U.S. military linguist is arming volunteers with Russian phrases like ""put your weapon down"" before they head to Ukraine to fight. Another U.S. veteran said he was in Ukraine linking volunteers to groups on the ground. They are among organizers from three U.S. online networks Reuters spoke to this week that are creating underground pipelines of military, medical and other volunteers for Ukraine. The networks are part of organized efforts to mobilize hundreds of North Americans prepared to fight for Ukraine, as well as thousands of other people across the globe. “You can learn a few words and phrases that may potentially save your life,” said the former Army linguist, who identified himself as Tex and was compiling terms in Ukrainian and Russian for combat or in the event of capture. The linguist's training group is helping military veterans brush up on skills like first aid or marksmanship. Most instruction is online. Some units do physical training together, he said. The three groups operate behind layers of security, performing background checks and video interviews over concerns Russian elements are trying to infiltrate and sabotage operations. Members stress they are private individuals who have no links to the U.S. government or U.S. armed services. ""There's been a lot of Russians trying to get in,"" said an individual representing one of the groups who identified himself as Checker 1 in a Zoom call. ""If something like this were to be exposed, it would be rather harmful."" He said his network had partnered with a Kyiv non-governmental organization to get international volunteers into the country. ""We work all over Ukraine,"" said the U.S. veteran who claimed to be in Ukraine, communicating via the Signal messaging app. An organizer for another group said it was interviewing candidates, forming units and matching them with groups in Ukraine. Messages from potential volunteers in Liberia, South Africa and the Netherlands came into the network's online group as the organizer chatted. ""There is a trickle of volunteers arriving daily and reaching their desired volunteer locations,"" said the organizer, who asked not to be named. BABY WIPES, BODY ARMOR Speaking on his Telegram page, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday said 16,000 foreigners have volunteered to fight for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. Ukraine has formed an ""international legion"" for the foreign force. Several organizers estimated the number of Canadian and U.S. volunteers heading to Ukraine was still in the dozens rather than hundreds. Ukrainian forces are seeking international reinforcement after Russian forces on Friday surrounded and bombarded several cities in the second week of an invasion launched by President Vladimir Putin. Of the more than one dozen potential volunteers Reuters spoke to in the United States and Canada, only a third said they had military, law enforcement, medical or conflict-zone experience. With limited resources, volunteer networks are focused on training and placement of military veterans in combat roles. As well as the networks, there are a host of individuals paying for air travel or offering advice. Canadian tech entrepreneur Vish Vadlamani considered fighting then decided he could be more useful sponsoring volunteers and using his software programming skills to help refugees. He said he and associates have raised about $20,000 in unused airline credit to cover airfares for volunteers. An American has created a 32-page Google document with information ranging from how to enlist in the Ukrainian army to an alphabetical packing list that starts with baby wipes and body armor. ""I do not recommend that anyone who does not speak Ukrainian or Russian and does not have military experience join the Ukrainian military,"" said the man in a video call, who asked that his name not be used, and identified himself as Kiwi.

3/5/2022,"SOCHI, Russia — On Feb. 23, Razil Malikov, a tank driver in the Russian army, called his family and said he would be home soon; his unit’s military drills in Crimea were just about wrapping up. The next morning, Russia invaded Ukraine, and Malikov hasn’t been heard from since. On Monday, Ukraine published a video of a captured soldier in his unit, apologizing for taking part in the invasion. “He had no idea they could send him to Ukraine,” Malikov’s brother, Rashid Allaberganov, said in a phone interview from the south-central Russian region of Bashkortostan. “Everyone is in a state of shock.” Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times The reality of war is dawning across Russia. On Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry for the first time announced a death toll for Russian service members in the conflict. While casualty figures in wartime are notoriously unreliable — and Ukraine has put the total of Russian dead in the thousands — the 498 Moscow acknowledged in the seven days of fighting is the largest in any of its military operations since the war in Chechnya, which marked the beginning of President Vladimir Putin’s tenure in 1999. Russians who long avoided engaging with politics are now realizing that their country is fighting a deadly conflict, even as the Kremlin gets ever more aggressive in trying to shape the narrative. Its slow-motion crackdown on freedoms has become a whirlwind of repression of late, as the last vestiges of a free press faced extinction. This week, lawmakers proposed a 15-year prison sentence for people who post “fakes” about the war, and rumors are swirling about soon-to-be-closed borders or martial law. The Education Ministry scheduled a video lesson to be shown in schools nationwide Thursday that described the war against Ukraine as a “liberation mission.” And in Moscow, the regional office of the Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia has been fielding 2,000 calls a day since last Thursday. “The parents’ first question is: What happened to my child?” said Alexander Latynin, a senior committee official. “Is he alive?” Seizing on the worries of Russian families, Ukraine has pushed to publicize the fact that many young Russian soldiers were dying or being taken prisoner — a reality that the Russian military did not acknowledge until Sunday, the fourth day of the war. Ukrainian government agencies and volunteers have published videos of disoriented Russian prisoners of war saying they had no idea they were about to be part of an invasion until just before it began, and photographs and footage showed the bodies of Russian soldiers strewn on streets and fields. The videos are reaching some Russians directly. Yevgeniya A. Ivanova, for instance, identified a friend of hers, Viktor A. Golubev, who appeared in one of the videos. In it, Golubev said he “feels guilty for his wrong actions” on Ukrainian soil and calls on Putin “to find a compromise to avoid war.” To some Russians, the toll in human lives is reason enough to oppose the war, and OVD-Info, an activist group that tallies arrests, has counted at least 7,359 Russians detained during seven days of protests in scores of cities across the country. “It’s the third decade of the 21st century, and we are watching news about people burning in tanks and bombed-out buildings,” Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, wrote in a social media post from prison Wednesday, calling on Russians to continue to rally despite the withering police crackdown. “Let’s not ‘be against war.’ Let’s fight against war.” Members of the Russian elite also continued to speak out. Lyudmila Narusova, a member of Russia’s upper house of Parliament, told the independent Dozhd television channel Sunday that dead Russian soldiers in Ukraine lay “unburied; wild, stray dogs gnawing on bodies that in some cases cannot be identified because they are burned.” “I do not identify myself with those representatives of the state that speak out in favor of the war,” Narusova said. “I think they themselves do not know what they are doing. They are following orders without thinking.” The Russian International Affairs Council, a government-funded think tank, published an article by a prominent expert describing the war as a strategic debacle. The expert, Ivan Timofeev, said Ukrainian society would now “see Russia as an enemy for several decades to come.” He added a veiled warning directed at government officials who were now cracking down on people speaking out against the war. “History shows that those who look for ‘traitors’ sooner or later themselves become victims of ‘enthusiasts’ and ‘well-wishers,’” wrote Timofeev, the council’s program director. But the discontent showed no sign of affecting Putin’s campaign, as Russia’s assault on Ukraine widened, with heavy fighting reported for the port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. The government signaled it would only intensify its crackdown against the war’s critics — including those who called it a “war” rather than, in the Kremlin’s anodyne term, a “special military operation.” “Individuals who carry out falsification must be punished in the most severe way,” said Vasily Piskaryov, a senior lawmaker in Putin’s party. “They are discrediting the absolutely rightful and understandable actions of our armed forces.” His proposed punishment: 15 years in prison. The Parliament, which is controlled by the Kremlin, will take up the law Friday. Some feared that Putin could go even further, repressing dissent to an extent unseen in Russia since Soviet times. Tatiana Stanovaya, a scholar who has long studied Putin, wrote it was “more than logical” to expect that lawmakers this week would approve the imposition of martial law in order to block the open internet, ban all protests and restrict Russians from being able to leave the country. Such speculation, fed by how quickly the Kremlin was moving to block access to individual news media outlets and arrest protesters, has led increasing numbers of Russians to flee the country. Echo of Moscow, Russia’s flagship liberal-leaning radio station, was taken off the air Tuesday for the first time since the Soviet coup attempt of 1991. Leading staff members of Dozhd, Russia’s only remaining independent television channel, left the country Wednesday after access to its website was blocked. “It’s clear that the personal security of some of us is under threat,” wrote Tikhon Dzyadko, the channel’s editor-in-chief, explaining why he had decided to “temporarily” depart. There was also evidence that, even though the war took many Russians by surprise, significant numbers had come to accept it as unavoidable or forced upon Russia by an aggressive NATO. The economic crisis touched off by the West’s harsh sanctions reinforced that narrative for some. On Wednesday, the ruble plumbed new lows as more companies like Siemens and Oracle announced they would reduce their operations in Russia and as the central bank ordered the Moscow stock exchange to remain shut Thursday for the fourth straight day. At a Moscow shopping mall Wednesday, a young couple lining up for cash at an ATM said they opposed the war. And yet they said that the way the world was punishing them for it was not fair, either, considering that the United States had fought its own wars in recent decades without coming under harsh international sanctions. “Just as you can criticize the government, you can criticize Western countries,” said Maksim Filatov, 25, who manages a hookah bar business. “When there were analogous situations in other countries involving the United States, there were no such attacks, and they didn’t drive the country into crisis.” And the Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers, despite being a firsthand witness to the tragedy wrought by the war, had decided to support it, according to Latynin, the senior official. He echoed the words of Putin, who last week described his “special military operation” as one of “self-defense.” “We understand that no armed conflict comes without victims,” Latynin said. “But this was a necessary step, because it was impossible to go on like this.” © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,A War the Kremlin Tried to Disguise Becomes a Hard Reality for Russians,https://news.yahoo.com/war-kremlin-tried-disguise-becomes-130008008.html

3/5/2022,"(Adds details, background) By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali WASHINGTON, March 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine still has a ""significant majority"" of its military aircraft available nine days after Russian forces started their invasion of the country, a U.S. defense official said on Friday. Vastly outmatched by Russia's military, in terms of raw numbers and firepower, the fact that Ukraine's own air force is still flying and its air defenses are still deemed to be viable has surprised military experts. ""The Ukrainians still have a significant majority of their air combat power available to them, both fixed-wing and rotary wing as well as unmanned systems and surface-to-air systems,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official added that Ukrainian aircraft had suffered some loses, including being destroyed by Russian forces, but did not give details. After the opening salvos of the war on Feb. 24, analysts expected the Russian military to try to immediately destroy Ukraine's air force and air defenses. Russia has fired more than 500 missiles at Ukrainian targets since the start of the invasion, but is still flying through contested airspace. Ukrainian troops with surface-to-air rockets are able to threaten Russian aircraft and create risk to Russian pilots trying to support ground forces. Ukraine's ability to keep flying air force jets is a visible demonstration of the country's resilience in the face of attack and has been a morale booster, both to its own military and Ukraine's people, experts say. 'ANSWERED THE PHONE' The Pentagon has established a new hotline with Russia's ministry of defense to prevent ""miscalculation, military incidents and escalation"" in the region as Russia's invasion of Ukraine advances. The ""deconfliction"" hotline would be an open phone line based at the European Command's headquarters and would fall under Air Force General Tod Wolters, who leads all U.S. forces on the continent. ""In our initial test of it, (the Russians) answered the phone,"" the official said. Russian troops were still about 25 km (16 miles) away from Kyiv's city center, largely unchanged over the past few days. The official compared an Odessa scenario to Russia's assault around Mariupol, where they used an amphibious assault to the southwest using naval infantry and also came down from the north with land forces out of Donetsk. ""So one could see a scenario where that's a similar play,"" the official said. The United States cannot refute reports that Russian forces are in control of the port city of Kherson, the official said, but added the United States could not confirm the takeover. Tanks entered Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.

3/5/2022,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has publicly disclosed a batch of stock trades made by her husband in January. According to the disclosure, Paul Pelosi's new investments include $2.9 million in Apple, Walt Disney, PayPal, and Amex shares. A House panel is due to debate a congressional stock trading ban that could include lawmakers' spouses. Nancy Pelosi has publicly disclosed her husband's investments in January, which include $2.9 million worth of American Express, Apple, PayPal, and Walt Disney stocks. According to a periodic transaction report dated Monday, Pelosi's husband invested between $250,000 and $500,000 in asset management firm AllianceBernstein. Under the STOCK Act, lawmakers must disclose stock transactions — be it their own or of family members — within 45 days. The disclosure comes amid calls by lawmakers for members of Congress and their spouses to be barred from trading individual stocks. On Thursday, Insider's Kimberly Leonard reported that a US House panel plans to meet on March 16 to debate a congressional stock trading ban. Punchbowl News reported in February that Pelosi was working on the ban. While she rejected the idea of a ban in December, she changed course the following month, signaling that she would be okay with letting lawmakers decide for themselves about it. However, Pelosi has been largely noncommital on whether spouses should be included in any proposed ban. The upcoming House panel meeting follows the release of Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" report — a five-month investigation that found that dozens of lawmakers and at least 182 senior congressional staffers had failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the STOCK Act. Pelosi's husband, financier Paul Pelosi, has been lauded as a star stock-picker for his winning trades, even prompting TikTokers to mimic his investments. His holdings in corporations — including Slack, Tesla, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix — have placed his wife in the 13th spot on Insider's list of 25 wealthiest members of Congress.

3/5/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Smartphone maker Apple has written to lawmakers to dispute assertions that its concerns about the dangers of sideloading apps into phones were overblown. Sideloading, the practice of downloading apps without using an app store, is among the reforms that lawmakers hope will open up the market for apps. Congress is currently considering a bill aimed at reining in app stores run by Apple and Alphabet's Google, which would require companies to allow sideloading. Apple has argued that such a practice would be a security risk as it keeps tight control of the apps in the store in order to keep users safe. In a letter dated Thursday and sent to key members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Apple said it was aware that a critic, computer security expert Bruce Schneier, had called its concerns about sideloading ""unfounded."" Apple went on to argue that most malware does not rely on technical tricks to gain access to devices but instead tricks the human user to download it. It argued that Apple's review of apps that are put into the App Store ""creates a high barrier against the most common scams used to distribute malware."" Apple acknowledged that Schneier was correct that state-sponsored attackers could get through smartphones' security controls but argued that these sorts of attacks are a ""rare threat."" ""There is ample evidence showing third-party app stores are a key malware vector on platforms which support such stores,"" Apple said in the letter which was viewed by Reuters. It was sent to Senate Judiciary Committee chair Dick Durbin, the top Republican, Chuck Grassley as well as Amy Klobuchar, chair of the antitrust subcommittee, along with the top Republican, Mike Lee. The committee voted in early February to approve the bill. The measure would also bar companies from requiring app providers to use their payment system and would prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices or conditions through another app store or payment system. The biggest technology companies, including Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook and Amazon.com, have been under pressure in Congress over allegations they abused their outsized market power. A long list of bills is aimed at reining them in, but none have yet become law.

3/5/2022,"WASHINGTON — The secretary of the U.S. Air Force said Thursday he’s not concerned about Russia’s decision to cut off the United States’ access to more RD-180 rocket engines. “I have not been informed at this point of any major launch concerns associated with that,” Frank Kendall told reporters during a media roundtable at the Air Force Association’s Air Warfare Symposium. The head of Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, said Thursday the country would no longer sell the RD-180 to the U.S. or provide support for launches powered by the Russian-made engine. “In a situation like this we can’t supply the United States with our world’s best rocket engines,” Dmitry Rogozin said in an appearance on Russian state television, Reuters reported. “Let them fly on something else, their broomsticks, I don’t know what.” The United Launch Alliance — one of two launch providers certified to fly national security space launches — carries the RD-180 on its Atlas V rocket, which the company is set to retire in 2025. The company has said it has enough engines on hand to power the remaining scheduled Atlas V launches. Asked to respond to Rogozin’s threats, which began on Twitter earlier this week, ULA CEO Tory Bruno said the company has “developed considerable experience and expertise” to troubleshoot any unexpected engine issues without help from Russia. The United States has in recent years weaned itself from the RD-180, developing an assured access to space strategy to invest in domestic launch vehicle suppliers and ensure at least two companies are certified to launch national security space payloads. The new strategy was driven by a 2016 congressional directive to eliminate reliance on the Russian-made propulsion system by 2022. Since then, the Air Force has introduced competition into its space launch program, certifying military space launch newcomer SpaceX to fly national security missions and awarding the company, along with long-time provider ULA, a five-year contract for launch services through fiscal 2027. The service has also invested in domestic launch vehicle development, providing early funding for ULA’s Atlas V replacement, the Vulcan Centaur. Despite some recent schedule setbacks, ULA plans to fly Vulcan for the first time this year. Kendall noted that the purpose of DoD’s strategy — which he played a significant role in crafting in his former role as Pentagon acquisition chief — was to eliminate dependencies on Russia. “The whole point of the program we put in place several years ago was to work our way off of the RD-180,” he said. “Other suppliers like SpaceX, for example, have come on board. ULA is moving towards a different solution that doesn’t involve the [RD-180]. I think our launch needs will be met.”",Business/Defense News,"US Air Force not concerned about Russia’s decision to halt rocket engine sales, support",https://news.yahoo.com/us-air-force-not-concerned-234351815.html
