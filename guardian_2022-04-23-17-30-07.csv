4/23/2022,"It was Candice Carty-Williams who came up with the “Black Bridget Jones” tagline for her debut novel, Queenie. (She wasn’t working in marketing for a publishing house at the time for nothing.) She wanted her novel, which follows the misadventures of millennial south London journalist Queenie, to reach as wide a readership as possible. She succeeded. Today, her name rarely appears without the words “publishing phenomenon” attached: Queenie won book of the year at the British book awards in 2020 (Bridget Jones took it in 1998), making Carty-Williams the first Black writer ever to get the prize, an indictment of the industry in itself. The novel has sold more than half a million copies and is being made into a TV drama on Channel 4. But where Bridget Jones’s Diary now seems dated in terms of sexual politics, Queenie is often deeply shocking in its depiction of the heroine’s treatment at the hands of a series of toxic men, taking in internet dating, mental health problems and the housing crisis, as well as everything else that goes with being a young woman. Toni Morrison’s famous injunction to write the book you want to read might have been conceived with a future Carty-Williams in mind. Written when she was in her early 20s, and landing in the midst of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, Queenie couldn’t have been more timely. Critics praised its combination of empathy, wit and political awareness; some readers recognised themselves in fiction for the first time. “Queenie was this big burst of 25-year-old energy: ‘I am sick of sexism and going on bad dates and hearing all this shit, and my friends having to go through all this shit, and going through shit at work. I have to write it all down,’” the author, now 33, says when we meet to talk about her much-anticipated second novel, People Person. “Queenie was so much about Blackness in response to whiteness, I’ve said what I needed to say about that,” she says. “It’s time to write something that is just about Black people. That’s it.” Also set in south London, People Person is about a non-nuclear family coming together rather than falling apart, but again touches on contemporary issues such as social media, revenge porn and distrust of the police. “I’m a proper south London girl for ever,” Carty-Williams declares, after welcoming me into her home in Streatham, just round the corner from where she grew up, which she was able to buy thanks to Queenie. It is decorated with touches of the candy-pink and lush green of one of the book’s original hardback designs. While she is delighted to finally have a place of her own (much of Queenie was written in a studio with mice and slugs for company), doing it up as a single woman was no fun. In a scene that might have come straight out of her debut novel, a workman cornered her in her bedroom one night and started lighting candles. “It was horrible, but I was also like, ‘Of course this happens,’” she says, settling into the sofa. Now she always has a friend over if a builder is coming. “That’s just how it is. It is absolutely awful, but I’m so accustomed to it.” On the wall behind her is the famous 1970s Jamaican tourist board poster of the model Sintra Arunte-Bronte in a wet T-shirt in the same candyfloss shade with the word “JAMAICA” across her breasts. “Yeah, she fits in,” Carty-Williams laughs. She has a small version of Sintra that goes on the top of her Christmas tree. More sombrely, on the other wall is a poster from the 2016 film Moonlight, which she saw at the Barbican with a live orchestra playing the score; she cried so much that a man asked her if she was OK. She cries a lot, she says. On the pink bookshelves, there are two black-and-white prints that she bought to support Black Lives Matter: one of a woman weeping, another of a boy in a hoodie, his face hidden by beautiful hands. “They are two identities that I’ve seen and that I’ve loved in my life – weeping and hiding,” she says. And a photograph of her nan, who was always her most stable influence growing up. “Isn’t she lovely!” How do you follow a smash hit like Queenie? Writer Kit de Waal advised her to get the next book out as quickly as possible, so Carty-Williams had already completed a novel about a group of friends by the time Queenie was going to press. She had even sent it to her editor. But looking at it again during lockdown, she just “wasn’t vibing with it”. It was all about grief and she felt the world was grieving enough. “That novel was so raw. I was like: ‘People don’t need this.’ So I just binned it,” she says. “There was no one there to stop me.” Then one night – she works best when it’s dark – she put a song on repeat and, starting at 11pm and finishing at six the following morning, wrote until she had 10,000 words. “This is it! This feels better,” she remembers thinking, albeit also feeling wired and sick. Queenie took off in a similar blast after Carty-Williams won a competition to spend a week writing in novelist Jojo Moyes’s house: she notched up 8,000 words in the first day, 40,000 by the end of the week. The whole novel was finished in six months, and she was working full time. The result of that all-nighter is People Person. The first chapter introduces us to the Pennington clan, five half-siblings who have never met before, until their errant father Cyril decides to pick them all up in his gold Jeep one day. Fast-forward 16 years and the farcical second chapter sees the now adult siblings reunited for the first time, when they have to deal with the body of Dimple’s abusive boyfriend, who has slipped and hit his head after a row. “Why would you call the police?” Dimple’s brother Danny asks when they are trying to work out what to do. “They’ll create some story and put it on you.” Against the background of the police handling of Richard Okorogheye’s disappearance (mentioned in the novel); murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, whose bodies were photographed by the officers guarding the crime scene; and, most recently, the strip-search of Child Q, People Person has the same grim urgency as Queenie. “I’m sick that it takes these things for people to realise ‘Oh, Black people are treated really badly,’” Carty-Williams says of Child Q. “It’s like, Yeah, of course! People see Black children as women. It is horrible. I had men talking about my body when I was not even 10 years old.” Just last week, the police pulled the author over in her car while she was singing along to music with a friend. “They ran my plates!” While Queenie dealt with difficult mother-daughter relationships, People Person is her “daddy issues” novel. “I know that as I go through my life I will always write the things that I’m trying to make sense of myself,” she says. “So when it came to dads, I was like: ‘I really have to do it.’” She is one of nine siblings with the same father – far too many characters for a novel, she jokes. Although she doesn’t keep in touch with all of them, “it’s nice to have different people to talk to”. Her father worked as a taxi driver and met her mother when he picked her up from her shifts as a hospital receptionist. It turned out he already had three children, and (like the characters Dimple and Lizzie in the novel) another sister was born to a different woman the same year. “It’s never clear!” she says, trying to work out how many mothers in all. “Your dad has how many kids?” she was always asked as a child, but it never really bothered her. “That’s my life. And there are people who have that life, too. I want to connect with those people and make them feel less lonely.” Unlike the gregarious Cyril in the novel, her father is not a people person, she says, showing me an old photo of him looking shyly at the camera on her phone. When he worked for London Underground she would visit him at the depots in Kennington or Morden. “We would just sit in silence together, and that was cool.” Earlier this morning, her mum was over for a visit. “She’s the funniest person I know,” Carty-Williams says. “We just get on.” But that hasn’t always been the case. It took her many years to realise that her parents were their own people and couldn’t really look after her, she says. “And it is really, really tough.” Her childhood was “very lonely and very shit”. She moved all over south London with her mother, ending up in a mouse-infested council house with no proper kitchen – it has since been boarded up. When she was eight they moved in with her mother’s new partner in Lewisham, which meant that her nan was no longer living round the corner, and a year later her sister was born. A turning point came when she was sent home from school for a week for bad behaviour and her stepfather made her go to the library every day. She discovered Sue Townsend, Louise Rennison and Malorie Blackman (“she has my heart in so many ways”) and books became her escape from the “chaos” in her head and the unhappiness around her. But in her early 20s, after university (communication and media studies at Sussex), she had “a terrible nervous episode” following the death of her best friend, Dan, from cancer – Queenie is dedicated to him. Eventually, with the help of a course of CBT on the NHS, she recovered enough to apply for a couple of internships and landed the marketing job at HarperCollins. “I just had so much fun,” she says. Although she was unable to ignore the lack of diversity: “It is men at the top and loads of white women in the middle; overwhelmingly so.” In 2016 she set up the Guardian 4th Estate BAME short story prize. “Obviously in this world if you are Black and you want to do something you still have to get permission from lots of white people to do it. Which is sad,” she says. And while there has been an improvement in the last few years, publishing still has a long way to go. As she says, the prize would never have happened had she not been given a job in the first place. “If you are there, you can see it and say it.” Then came Queenie and Carty-Williams was the one winning prizes. When she found out she had won the Nibbies’ book of the year award, the first thing she did was find a therapist. “I was in such a place of not liking myself,” she says, that receiving public accolades was just too much. She has been with the therapist ever since: “It has changed my life. I’m going to be with her until I don’t need to be with her again, which won’t be any time soon.” Although she is more settled than she has ever been, she still finds happiness difficult: “I’m not naturally a very happy person. But that’s all right because I’m used to it.” Both Queenie and Dimple struggle with insecurity and anxiety, and she is keen to challenge the stereotype of Black women as strong and resilient in her fiction (Queenie is the first person in the family “to go to psychotherapy!”, her Jamaican grandmother declares in horror). Although rooted in what she knows (she would never write a book set in west London, she says), her novels are not autobiographical: she is so fed up with people assuming that she is Queenie that she refuses to give readings. “I wouldn’t want anyone to hear me speak in her voice and think we’re the same person.” As she likes to point out, nobody asks Ian McEwan if he suffers from premature ejaculation, referring to the crucial scene in On Chesil Beach. “Nobody! Of course women would have to write about all their emotions and feelings,” she says. “But we also have imaginations.” As well as adapting Queenie for Channel 4, she is also writing a TV drama called Champion for the BBC, about a rapper who comes out of prison – in south London, “obviously”. Rereading Queenie for the first time, she is shocked at how dark it is in places, and the “absolutely wild” sex scenes. “Oh my God, did I really write that?” Neither her mum, her nan or her sister have read the novel. “They are not really fussed,” she says. “They know what I do.” Although her mum promises to be first in the line to buy People Person. Writing has introduced her to a new community, and she stresses how fellow authors such as Zadie Smith, Diana Evans and Raven Leilani have supported her. “When you are a young Black writer, I think you’ve got to hold each other up. We are always in it together and you kind of have to be.” There’s “pride and there’s sadness” in being a Black woman in publishing, she says. “It is amazing seeing all the authors who are being given opportunities because publishers can finally see that Black books sell. And they win prizes.” One of her favourite recent books is Open Water by Caleb Azumah Nelson, which won the Costa first novel award this year, but which she believes might not have been published 10 years ago. Queenie not only transformed her life, but has helped other young writers like her. “It’s always going to be my special ‘little project’, as my nan calls it.”  People Person is published by Trapeze on 28 April (£12.99).

4/23/2022,"When landlords hit the headlines it tends to be for the worst of reasons – what we don’t tend to hear are the stories of tenants who live in properties in good condition, where the owner quickly replaces the fridge when it breaks or organises for an electrician to fix the flickering light fitting. There are about 1.5 million residential landlords in England, according to the 2018 English Private Landlord Survey, and in 2020-21, the private rented sector accounted for 4.4 million, or 19%, of households in England. Earlier this month, a committee of MPs reported that more than one in eight of these homes posed a risk to safety, and that it was “too difficult for renters to realise their legal right to a safe and secure home”. This week there has also been news of a major charity failing to look after the homes of some of its tenants. But alongside the problem properties, and the landlords who are doing everything they should be a doing, there are some owners who are going the extra mile for their tenants. “We’re not all terrible landlords,” says Heather Scott, 41, a copywriter, who started renting out her dad’s property in Whitstable when he went into care, charging the tenants less than the market rent. “We both liked to put our morals where our mouth is and the rents here are astronomical,” she says. They decided to rent out the property to a friend and her three children who were “living in a tiny house” nearby for which they paid £760 a month. For the same money the family now live in a three-bedroom detached house with a large garden and parking close to the children’s school and a 10-minute walk to the beach. “We worked out that level of rent would cover my dad’s care home bill and she would have a lovely place to live,” Scott says. “Dad has since died but I’m happy with the renting situation as I know the children have stability in their lives, I have long-term income coming from the property, which I no longer have a mortgage on, and it isn’t losing value. “Yes, I could probably charge double the rent but in a town where a three-bed terrace house costs at least £1,300 a month in rent and the average wage is about £20,000 a year, it didn’t seem right.” As in many tourist hotspots, there are only a small number of properties to rent in Whitstable. Pointing to the rise of holiday lets in the coastal town, Scott says she can “count the key safes down the road”. She says there are 20 empty homes on the street. “I know I could earn at least four times as much renting through Airbnb but that would mean taking a home away from a family who have roots and work in our town,” she says. Homeless at 19 and sleeping in sheds, back gardens and train stations, Lara Oyedele, 55, is perhaps an unlikely landlord. But those tough beginnings led Oyedele to study a master’s in housing, move into a career in social housing and become a landlord herself. She has a portfolio of 10 rental properties in Bradford. “The first properties (prior to 2014) were bought purely for investment,” she says. “I was working full-time within the social housing sector, so I was doing my bit. But even then, I was determined that my rents would be affordable. The properties acquired after 2014 were bought with the full intention of creating a portfolio of affordable homes so I could support others and be a good landlord.” Oyedele, who is the vice-president of the Chartered Institute of Housing, says: “I remember that feeling when I eventually got a council flat. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. It was in a grotty block with two bedrooms but I could shut the door and it was mine.” She keeps the rents on her nine properties as low as possible. “I’ve never charged market rates,” Oyedele says. “It’s not fair on people. If I don’t need the money and can make an OK profit and be kind to other people [that’s good enough].” She is also flexible and willing to stagger payments or help out tenants at times of crisis. “A couple of years ago my tenant had issues with family stuff and I said: ‘Listen, don’t pay the £350 in rent in December, just put an extra £100 on top of your rent for the next few months,’” she says. “I have one tenant who can’t work, her rent is cheaper than the mortgage. I try to keep rents low so people aren’t stressing out about paying rent, and I organise repairs as quickly as I can.” On top of providing homes, she says she recently bought baby items for tenants. “I also do coaching and help my tenants with interview skills. I say I’ll help you get a job, send me your CV. Although one tenant did say to me: ‘It’s my personal life; it’s not your business.’” Moira Beattie, 60, who lives in Chertsey, lets out four bedsits in the building above her hair and beauty salon via Rentstart, a charity that works with landlords to offer properties to people facing homelessness. “I think everyone deserves a chance,” Beattie says. “I’ve got to know a lot of the 20 tenants who have lived here since I bought the building in 2008 and have helped several with trips to the jobcentre. Many have gone on to find jobs. I quite like being this kind of landlord. I like helping people. People can’t get a job or bank account if they don’t have anywhere to live. Once they have somewhere to call home they can start rebuilding their life.” Beattie keeps rents as low as possible. “All I want to do is pay my mortgage. I’m not in it to make money from my tenants,” she says. “My investment is the building.” When Jacqui Furneaux, 72, a retired nurse and travel writer living in Bristol, bought a two-bedroom flat in Clevedon last year with money her brother had left her she knew she wanted to do something “useful” with her inheritance. “I set the wheels in motion to let it out to refugees and contacted North Somerset council, who allocated it to a lovely family from Afghanistan who I believe had helped the British armed forces,” she says. “It seemed like a nice way of saying welcome.” The couple and their three-year-old son moved into the property in December. “I’ve met them several times, they’re lovely,” Furneaux says. “I’m so pleased to have helped. The father messages to say how happy they are.” Furneaux, who rents out the flat for £850 a month, says she was told by estate agents that she could receive rental income of more than £1,000. “I don’t miss the extra money; I’m in a fortunate position that I have the state pension and an occupational pension,” she says. “It’s comforting to know a family who have helped the forces have a home.” Lee Coates, an ethical money and environmental, social and corporate governance consultant, says there is nothing intrinsically unethical about being a landlord. “Those who cannot buy and need to rent need landlords to provide a property to rent,” he says. “How the landlord acts, however, is where ethics come in. We all know of instances where problems are not sorted and landlords do not meet even basic requirements – making an extra few pounds at the tenant’s expense. A landlord charging a fair rent and meeting their obligations, keeping the property in good condition, should be the norm.” Richard Blanco, a spokesperson for the National Residential Landlords Association and the owner of 14 rental properties, says most tenants have a positive experience with their landlord. “It’s a small minority of landlords who misbehave,” he says. “There’s some accidental landlords who don’t know the regulations and some downright stupid or negligent ones. You only hear about the small proportion because it’s much more newsworthy to report on the evil landlord. No one ever calls the local authorities to say how wonderful their landlord is. Hearing about a landlord repairing the boiler is really boring.” Of his own properties, he says: “If someone reports an issue to me, I want to fix it asap.” He adds: “Knowing the tenant individually and understanding their lives is important. You’ve got to help them and encourage them to stay on top of their rent.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘We’re not all terrible’: the landlords who keep rents low,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/23/were-not-all-terrible-the-landlords-who-keep-rents-low
4/23/2022,"President Emmanuel Macron faced Marine Le Pen, his far-right challenger, in a televised debate on Wednesday ahead of Sunday’s crucial runoff vote. The media agreed that Macron had largely dominated the exchanges. Viewers interviewed by pollsters agreed that Macron had been more convincing, more dynamic and more sincere. Yet following the debate, Libération declared on its front page that Le Pen was “still not up to par”. This was an astonishing headline on the part of a centre-left newspaper. Does it mean that had Le Pen had better oratory skills and a better grasp of policy details, she would be worthy of becoming president? Meanwhile, most of the commentary about the debate failed to point out that Le Pen is a far-right candidate who has extreme views on immigration, Islam, civil liberties, the EU and Putin’s Russia. This shows that the normalisation of Le Pen’s far right movement is at an advanced stage. While debating with Le Pen, Macron further “de-demonised” the Rassemblement National’s leader by focusing on policy details. During the three-hour debate, Macron sounded nerdy and technocratic. He endeavoured to demonstrate to French voters that he has the best policies. Not once did the incumbent label his opponent a “far-right” politician; nor did he mention that some of her policies were a threat to democracy; nor did he stress that should Le Pen be elected president, France’s standing in the world would be tarnished. Yet her programme attacks major civil liberties: she vows to ban the hijab in public spaces, to curb asylum-seekers’ rights, to end the granting of French nationality to youngsters born in France from foreign parents, and to discriminate against foreigners by allocating welfare provisions to French nationals only. Macron’s performance lacked vision and a sense of historic momentum. During the debate, his task was to emotionally engage with reluctant voters – notably left-leaning voters. By adopting a technocratic and professorial rhetoric, Macron depoliticised the debate. He sounded competent but also lacking in empathy; meanwhile, Le Pen came across as much more empathetic, despite her hardline views. This is the heart of the problem. Macron’s critics argue that his policy shift to the right and his aloof, Jupiterian style of government are partly to blame for the rise of the far right. He has given free rein to members of the government who have used far-right rhetoric, and he has supported the adoption of repressive policies on Islam, immigration and law and order. According to the latest polls, Macron is on course to get re-elected with a much-reduced majority. He cannot afford to be complacent, yet he seems oblivious to the danger he is in. To win, he must secure the support of a large chunk of the 7.7 million who voted for the radical left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Most of those voters detest Macron’s policies and most of them abhor his persona. The latest figures show that 42% may vote for him, but 25% may choose Le Pen and 33% may abstain. In the words of some Mélenchon voters, it is a case of “choosing between plague and cholera”. Macron’s staggering realignment of party politics has led to the demise of the two dominant parties of French politics: the centre-left Parti Socialiste and the centre-right Républicains. Three blocs have now emerged: a liberal-conservative one around Macron, a far-right one led by Le Pen, and a divided and weakened left led by Mélenchon. The France Insoumise leader has radicalised a fraction of the leftwing electorate. For some Mélenchonistes, Macron is as dangerous as, if not more dangerous than, Le Pen. In some quarters of the radical Left, Macron was branded a “dictator” for implementing an immunity pass during the pandemic. This sort of political confusion is a recipe for disaster at the ballot box. On social media, there is currently a lot of soul-searching: should one abstain or vote against Le Pen? It appears that an increasing number of leftwing voters will pinch their nose and vote for Macron on Sunday, notably those who would have a lot to lose from a Le Pen presidency: the young, the racialised and the impoverished middle classes, the core of Mélenchon’s electorate. This reluctant push may be enough for Macron to get over the finishing line, but a political system that blackmails a majority of its citizens to vote against their interests is brutal and unhealthy. Once re-elected, Macron should expect a backlash.

4/23/2022,"One hundred and two years of hurt. Alderney’s losing streak in the Muratti Vase, the annual tournament to decide the champion of the Channel Islands between themselves, Jersey and Guernsey, is something to behold. Their Muratti triumph in 1920 is not just the last time they won the competition, it’s the last time they won a match in it. Not that it is a particularly fair fight, with Jersey’s population of 112,000 and Guernsey’s 68,000 dwarfing the 1,800 on Alderney. “Winning would be like a non-league team beating a Premier League side,” says the club secretary, Lee Sanders. “The gulf is probably comparable with that. But it is not impossible.” It’s the hope that, year after year, keeps Alderney coming back. There is fresh enthusiasm for this Saturday’s game against Guernsey. However frequent or devastating the Muratti defeat – the record loss stands at 18-0 (to Jersey) in 1994 – the gilded opportunity to be the team that finally break the losing run is tantalising. Since the famous 1920 win, Alderney have scored 39 goals, and conceded 462 in the fixture. “We’ve had some close matches recently,” remarks Reg Atkins, Alderney’s chairman for six years and involved since 2002. “We’ve also been annihilated. The whole island lives in hope rather than expectation.” Tensions run high between the islands, and Alderney’s mindset is influenced by the fact that in the past Jersey and Guernsey have seen victory over their smaller neighbour as a formality. “The first year I joined, Ron ‘Chopper’ Harris was manager of Jersey,” Atkins says. “They had already booked their flight home on the proviso that there wouldn’t be extra time, and the tickets for the final were already printed without our names on it. When we hit the post in the last few minutes to almost take the game into extra time, we gave them a scare.” As the smallest island of only three square miles, Alderney alternate between playing Jersey and Guernsey in a home semi-final, with the winner facing the other team in the final. With 25 miles to Guernsey and 35 miles to Jersey the only feasible way to travel between each island is by an unreliable ferry or an expensive aeroplane. It is a problem that blights the domestic season. Alderney also compete as a club side on a weekly basis but every opponent is based in Guernsey. “An average away day costs the club close to £1,700,” Atkins says. “That’s flights, hotels, car hire, insurance, sometimes paying for a player to come from the mainland. And two-thirds of our games are away, as the Guernsey sides refuse to travel here more than once a season.” There cannot be many places in the British Isles where it is more difficult to organise a game of football. Last season there were six home games and 16 away, costing more than £25,000. There are no Football Association grants to subsidise this, with money raised through annual player subs (a princely £700 each) and fundraising: club membership, player and match sponsors, scratchcards, raffles, programme sales. Things aren’t much easier for home matches. The Arsenal Ground, situated on a slope beneath Fort Albert, an old Victorian coastal fortification, is not the most welcoming place. “It’s quite exposed here,” Sanders ays. “I once saw our goalkeeper take a goalkick and it went straight out for a corner.” There are further problems beneath the surface. “Until recently we had problems with rabbit holes and moles on the pitch,” says Atkins. “But there was a big culling so we’re OK now. But there are no indoor training facilities, no floodlights. In the past we’ve even had car headlights and head torches to light up the pitch for training during winter. Every home match we have to have a referee come over from Guernsey. It’s ridiculous what we have to put up with.” Infrastructure and finances aside, the biggest challenge is recruitment. More than half the Alderney population is over the age of 55. “We’ve got quite a geriatric population,” Atkins says. “There are just 125 children on the island.” To play in the Muratti, one must have been born on Alderney or lived there for at least six months, which leaves a pool of men aged 16-34 of fewer than 100. It is not unreasonable to say that while Alderney have the demands of an international side, they have the catchment area of an average pub team. The fierce support for the team on the island, though, is anything but amateur. A quarter of the island’s population, about 450 fans, are expected to turn out on Saturday, some making the mile-long train journey from town aboard a steam train with decommissioned London Underground carriages (the Channel Islands’ only railway). The high street in town is decked out in blue to support the team. There is a mascot, merchandise, programme, a live stream of the game for natives – or Ridunians – unable to attend. “People here are very proud of their island,” says Sanders. “I think it stems back from the war years, when people were evacuated and then forced to rebuild after the Nazis left.” Occupied from 1940-45 during the second world war, the Germans built a concentration camp and labour camps on Alderney. “Everyone is reminded every day by the bunkers, lookout towers and underground tunnels that remain today,” says Sanders. One of those evacuated was the grandmother of Josh Concanen, the football team’s player-manager and the linchpin of the side. Concanen left the island as a boy to play in Exeter City’s youth team and returned to Alderney after playing semi-professionally in England. “When I first came back here we had a dreadful reputation to start with,” he says. “But the recent results have been some of the best we’ve ever had. The playing standard can be highly frustrating for me but also rewarding to see improvement. It helps that we’re all really good friends who have grown up together so we can be quite critical of each other and still get on fine afterwards.” Alderney’s semi-final opponents this year, Guernsey, normally play in the semi-professional Isthmian League, and Concanen is hoping they arrive with a degree of complacency. “It’s up to them if they want to carry on that way. There’s enough quality here. One day it’s going to bite them in the arse. There is a bit of resentment for sure. “Winning it would be an absolutely huge moment for Alderney. For the whole community it’s a big thing – it would be a hell of a day.”",Sport/Football,‘The island lives in hope’: Alderney out to end 102-year wait for win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/the-island-lives-in-hope-alderney-out-to-end-102-year-wait-for-win
