3/18/2022,"A missing 8-month-old is safe and sound after spending the night in an open field where authorities say his mother abandoned him this week. The child didn’t appear to be hurt and was taken to a hospital for “precautionary medical treatment” after crews located him Wednesday, March 16, according to Baton Rouge police. Several agencies, including the Baton Rouge Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services, assisted in a massive search for the child after learning he had been left alone, The Advocate reported, citing emergency officials. Emergency responders scoured the area on foot, and a helicopter spotted the baby from overhead. East Baton Rouge EMS spokesman Mike Chustz told the newspaper that the child “didn’t even cry during the rescue.” “The timing didn’t give us a lot of hope,” Chustz added, “but the baby was tough.” The baby’s mother, who wasn’t named, led first responders to the area near a church where she left her child the day before, WAFB reported, citing fire department officials. She showed up at a fire station Tuesday, March 15, and was taken to a hospital before checking into a mental treatment facility. During her treatment, officials said she mentioned leaving her baby in a field, according to the news station. McClatchy News reached out to the Baton Rouge Fire Department on Thursday, March 17, and was awaiting a response. No charges have been filed, and police said the incident remains under investigation. In a statement, Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome thanked first responders and the community for their efforts to find the missing boy. She also pointed residents to mental health services and other resources if they’re experiencing a crisis. “The Lord guided your efforts today,” Broome said.

3/18/2022,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended Chinese President Xi Jinping's timetable to invade Taiwan, according to documents purportedly written by a Russian intelligence analyst in one of Moscow's security agencies. ""Xi Jinping was at least considering taking over Taiwan in the fall - he needs his own little victory to get re-elected for a third term - there the struggle within the elite is colossal,"" an agent in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor agency to the KGB, allegedly wrote on March 9. China will hold its 20th Communist Party Congress this fall, and Xi has said it will be a ""major event."" Analysts have predicted that Xi will either be re-elected as the general secretary of the Communist Party or be elected to the chairmanship of the party, a position that has not existed since 1982. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""Now, after the Ukrainian events, this window of opportunity has been closed to him, which gives the United States the opportunity to both blackmail Xi and negotiate with its competitors on favorable terms,"" the FSB agent added. ""It was in this case that we launched a trap mechanism for China with our actions."" The agent added that the FSB is ""seriously considering"" claiming that ""the battle on Ukrainian territory is a US war against China, in which the Americans simply set us up and used us."" ""The global clash between the US and China was inevitable,"" the agent wrote. ""After the war with Ukraine (although I may avoid using the term ‘operation’ here), the cost of resources in the world, especially energy ones, has gone up. The main victim of such actions becomes China, to which (I can confirm) were given guarantees that everything will end quickly. Therefore, China behaved tolerant in the past. But that was before that."" ""China may well give us a tough ultimatum to end the war to stabilize oil prices,"" the agent predicted. ""If this happens, I don't want to predict anything - it's just on the horizon of disaster events."" RUSSIAN FAILURES IN UKRAINE LEAVE ‘NO OPTION FOR A POSSIBLE VICTORY,' ALLEGED FSB WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS Vladimir Osechkin, founder of the Gulagu.net human rights group, published the report on his Facebook page last week. He claimed that the same FSB agent wrote this document and the March 5 report that claimed a Russian victory in Ukraine had become a near impossibility. Christo Grozev, who works for the Netherlands-based investigative journalism group Bellingcat, tweeted that he showed the March 5 letter to two FSB contacts, one current and one former employee. They had no doubt that the author was a colleague, he said. As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation. BIDEN'S ‘BYSTANDER IN CHIEF’ APPROACH TO UKRAINE MAY EMBOLDEN CHINA IN ATTACKING TAIWAN; EXPERT WARNS China may emerge as the primary beneficiary of the Russia-Ukraine war, Steve Gray, a New Jersey congressional candidate and former FBI special agent who worked on China and North Korea, told Fox News Digital earlier this month. Gray warned that China has ""been given a case study of what the world's response would look like if they were to invade Taiwan."" Russian President Vladimir Putin considers Ukraine a part of historic Russia, and Xi considers Taiwan a part of China. Yet, as the FSB agent suggested, this very similarity may provide reasons for China to rethink a potential invasion of Taiwan. The Ukrainian people's resolve against Russia has reportedly stalled the Kremlin's timeline for the war, and peace talks are ongoing. In October, Biden said the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China attacks. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson responded by saying, ""No one should underestimate the strong resolve, determination and capability of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China has no room for compromise.""",World/Fox News,"Ukraine war upended China's plan to invade Taiwan, alleged FSB whistleblower says",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-upended-china-apos-074856101.html

3/18/2022,"Ron Jeremy’s serial rape case was suspended in Los Angeles on Thursday after the jailed porn star appeared incoherent and unable to recognize his own lawyer ahead of a critical hearing in the case. “I was just up in the cell where he was being kept, and I tried to get his attention unsuccessfully,” his defense lawyer, Stuart Goldfarb, told the court ahead of what was supposed to be a key hearing in the disturbing case involving 21 alleged victims. “He was unable to determine who I was and wouldn’t accommodate both myself and the bailiff to fit into the wheelchair to come down here. I don’t think he should be forced to come down her under these circumstances.” More from Rolling Stone Inside Ron Jeremy's Ridiculous Motion To Have 21 Sexual Assault Trials Ron Jeremy Gets New May 2 Trial Date in Los Angeles County Rape Case Ron Jeremy Rape Trial Due to Begin in February, Judge Says After stating that the bailiff had also told the court Jeremy was “incoherent” and “not obeying commands,” Judge George Lomeli said from the bench that he would suspend the proceedings. The judge referred the case to a mental health courthouse for an April 1 hearing and set a follow-up date back in his criminal courtroom for April 19. “Hopefully” by that date, “evaluations done by a psychiatrist on each side regarding the issues of competency” will clarify the situation, Lomeli said. Jeremy, whose legal name is Ronald Jeremy Hyatt, was indicted last August on 34 counts of sexual assault involving the 21 complaining witnesses. The charges, dating as far back as 1996, involve alleged victims ranging in age from 15 to 51 and a dozen counts of forcible assault. He had pleaded not guilty. According to court documents, Jeremy allegedly used his role as a cuddly elder statesman in the porn industry to disarm women and entice them into secluded areas. Many of the alleged assaults were said to have taken place at the Rainbow Bar and Grill, a West Hollywood dining establishment where Jeremy was a regular who enjoyed VIP access to employee areas. The Thursday hearing was supposed to center on Jeremy’s request to have his case broken up into 21 separate trials. “Allowing Mr. Hyatt’s jury to hear about dozens of allegations of alleged misconduct will prevent his jurors from judging him fairly on each charged count and from scrupulously applying the burden of proof,” his defense motion calling for the separate trials reads. Prosecutors oppose the motion, saying the charged offenses involve the same class of crimes and are “connected by a common plan.” That means they would be cross-admissible in separate trials and involve overlapping witnesses, which would waste judicial resources. They argue eight of the 21 Janes Does allegedly were attacked at the Rainbow Bar and Grill “using very similar methods.” “More important to the people than the time of the jurors or court is the risk of re-traumatization inherent in having sexual assault victims testify repeatedly,” Assistant District Attorney Marlene Martinez argues in her office’s opposition filing obtained by Rolling Stone. “In all 21 cases, the defendant preyed on victims that were vulnerable and unable to fight back. Whether that was by isolating the women in a bathroom, in a bedroom, at his friend’s house, in a parking lot or by perpetrating a surprise attack upon them, the defendant never gave the women an opportunity to fight back as he sexually assaulted them,” the reply says. “The only way to prevent a substantial waste of court time, juror time and victim and witness time is to have a joint trial.” The judge declined to hear further arguments or issue a ruling Thursday pending Jeremy’s mental health evaluation.

3/18/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday Joe Biden's claim that President Vladimir Putin was a ""war criminal"" for invading Ukraine was an unforgivable remark by the leader of a country which had killed civilians in conflicts across the world. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands, displaced more than 3 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers. In an exchange with a reporter on Wednesday, Biden said, ""Oh I think he is a war criminal,"" after initially responding with a ""no"" to a question about whether he was ready to call Putin that. ""Our president is a very wise, prescient and cultured international figure and head of the Russian Federation, our head of state,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about Biden's remark. ""Such statements by Mr Biden are absolutely impermissible, unacceptable and unforgivable,"" Peskov said. ""The main thing is that the head of a state which has for many years bombed people across the world... the president of such a country has no right to make such statements."" Peskov said the United States had bombed defeated Japan in 1945, destroying the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan surrendered six days later, ending World War Two. Around 200,000 people were killed instantly by the bombs and many more died from radiation sickness. MIGHT OF RUSSIA Russia warned the United States on Thursday that Moscow had the might to put the world's pre-eminent superpower in its place and accused the West of stoking a wild Russophobic plot to tear Russia apart. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said the United States had stoked ""disgusting"" Russophobia in an attempt to force Russia to its knees. ""It will not work - Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place,"" Medvedev said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United States and its European and Asian allies have slapped sanctions on Russian leaders, companies and businessmen, cutting off Russia from much of the world economy. Putin says that what he calls the special military operation in Ukraine was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia, and Russia had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. The West says claims it wants to rip Russia apart are fiction. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told European Union lawmakers on Wednesday that they should recognise Putin as a war criminal. Russia says that despite sanctions it can fare well without what it casts as a deceitful and decadent West and that it will develop ties with other powers such as China.
