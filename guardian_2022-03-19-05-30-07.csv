3/19/2022,"Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has praised Fox News for its coverage, appearing on the Russian state-controlled RT network to hail the right-leaning US cable channel, whose primetime host Tucker Carlson has played down the invasion. “We know the manners and the tricks that are being used by the western countries to manipulate media, we understood long ago that there is no such thing as an independent western media,” said Lavrov, speaking in English in a studio interview on Friday. “If you take the United States, only Fox News is trying to present some alternative point of view,” he said. He also denounced the social media ban of former president Donald Trump and took exception to the description of January 6 rioters as terrorists. “But when you watch other channels, read the social networks and internet platforms, when the acting president was blocked and this censorship continues in a very big way … Whenever something is happening by the way of mass protest, mass demonstrations – which they don’t like – they immediately call it domestic terrorism. “So it’s a war, and it’s a war which involves the methods of information terrorism,” he said. Russian media regularly plays clips of Carlson criticising the US and Ukraine, and he was still praising Russian president Vladimir Putin hours before Russia invaded Ukraine almost four weeks ago. In contrast, as Moscow’s bombardment escalated, Russian apologism by numerous Fox hosts, commentators and guests was being corrected on air by the network’s own national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin. The mental split-screen effect only sharpened earlier this week when a Fox news team on the ground in Ukraine came under Russian fire on the frontline. Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova were both killed during a Russian attack outside the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Correspondent Benjamin Hall was badly wounded in the incident. Lavrov’s comments on Friday came as six western nations accused Moscow of using the UN security council to launder disinformation and spread propaganda, after Russian diplomats again raised allegations that the US was involved in biological weapons, which have been repeatedly denied by both Washington and Ukraine. Western diplomats slammed the claims, with Britain’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward calling Russia’s tactics as the “disinformation of the desperate.”",News/World news,Russian foreign minister praises Fox News coverage of war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/sergei-lavrov-praises-fox-news-coverage-ukraine
3/19/2022,"Adefiant young woman imprisoned in a perspex cube no longer wants to be called Antigone. Darren Murphy’s new adaptation of the Greek tragedy seems similarly ambivalent about its origins, as if unsure whether to shrug off the original entirely. In his reduced version, subtitled “after Sophocles”, the city of Thebes has been ravaged by a dangerous virus. During this state of emergency, X’ntigone (Eloise Stevenson) has joined a resistance movement against her uncle Creon’s government. About to proclaim Freedom Day, Creon (Michael James Ford) promises to release her if she denounces her dead brother as a traitor. Emma Jordan’s sleek production for Belfast’s Prime Cut and the Mac has a futuristic edge, with Ciaran Bagnall’s design suggesting an art gallery where seductive technology enables new forms of surveillance and control. In an intense confrontation between uncle and niece, each accuses the other of “weaponising” the virus. Bristling with references to culture wars, including plans to destroy statues of dead statesmen, intergenerational conflict is the central theme here, powerfully portrayed. X’ntigone’s disgust at Creon’s cynicism is expressed in Stevenson’s physical revulsion, while Ford’s tone is smoothly supercilious, mocking her new “playground name”. Amid the focus on political spin, the central drama of conscience drifts far out of sight through over complication. Issues are piled on, from biological warfare to corruption, with the Oedipus family backstory adding layers of murkiness. Threatening to release a lethal new strain of the virus, X’ntigone says: “Sometimes you need to destroy the world because the world is broken.” It is a nihilistic credo, bleakly shifting the moral balance of the play’s arguments, so that the only choices left are between different degrees of destructiveness.

3/19/2022,"Are Real Madrid any good? They are 10 points clear in La Liga but the sense is that Spanish football is in retreat. They were outplayed for two and a half hours of the last-16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain and for all the brilliance of Karim Benzema and Luka Modric in those final minutes, it’s also true that the turnaround was as much the result of another PSG collapse as anything they did. Although Carlo Ancelotti’s substitutions made an impact, with Eduardo Camavinga’s energy a major factor, they remain reliant on an ageing midfield. And the feeling with Spanish sides for some time is that physically they are not comfortable against an aggressive press – which perhaps, as much as the need to deny Kylian Mbappé space to accelerate into, explains their weird timidity in Paris. Madrid will also be aware that Chelsea’s victory over them in last season’s semi-final was more comfortable than the 3-1 aggregate scoreline may have suggested. Although uncertainty haunts the European champions after the sanctions against Roman Abramovich, performances have remained good and there has always been a sense that Thomas Tuchel’s slightly more conservative model of the pressing game is better suited to European competition than the league. Prediction Chelsea win Atlético are going through one of their periodic crises of identity, as they toy with switching to a more expansive approach before returning to the defensive, deep-lying spoiling and counterattacking that brought victory over Manchester United. This has not been a classic Atlético season. Even with 10 games to go they have let in more goals than ever before under Diego Simeone, a detail only partly to do with an attempt to push higher up the pitch. Jan Oblak has been one of the best goalkeepers in the world since joining Atlético in 2014, but this season his save percentage has dropped from 75-80% in the previous seven years to 54%. At the other end, João Félix, at 22, looks as though he may be delivering on the expectations that persuaded Atlético to pay £113m for him in 2019. It was after a slightly freakish Champions League semi-final defeat in 2016 for his Bayern against Atlético that Pep Guardiola started making unexpected tactical switches in European ties in an attempt to head off the threat of potential counters. A repeat is probably a bigger danger to City than the infinitesimal downturn in form that has reopened the Premier League title race. Prediction City win Whenever Unai Emery coaches outside of Spain, it doesn’t quite seem to work. But with not-quite-superclub Spanish sides he is a master, particularly in knockout ties. Victory over Juventus in the last 16 was meticulously planned and clinically executed, and as Manchester United found repeatedly over the past year, Emery is very good at setting up a side to prevent the opposition playing. The return of Gerard Moreno from injury, coming off the bench with 17 minutes remaining in Turin, means they have a cutting edge. That said, they are seventh in Spain. Bayern, while a formidable attacking force, are vulnerable in two ways. First, their squad is relatively slender and while Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso should return to bolster the midfield options, Alphonso Davies’s heart problems led to Bayern deploying a back three against RB Salzburg. Although the Austrians were ultimately overwhelmed, there were repeated occasions when they got in behind the wing-backs, which suggests Arnaut Danjuma could be a threat. The other potential weakness is the inexperience of their 34-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann, who has not got the best record in big European games, although admittedly with teams far less gifted than Bayern. Prediction Bayern win There is a fine line between a perfectly judged European away performance and just getting lucky and, in the last 16, Benfica were probably on the wrong side of it. They were outplayed at home by Ajax but scrambled a 2-2 draw, and then were outplayed to an even greater degree in Amsterdam, pinching a 1-0 win thanks to a goalkeeping error as their opponents missed a string of chances. Darwin Núñez is a centre-forward of clear ability, Rafa Silva’s surges down the right caused repeated problems for Ajax, and may threaten Andy Robertson, and the goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos made a number of fine saves, but Benfica surely can’t be so fortunate again. Their domestic form is no better than average: Nélson Veríssimo took interim charge when Jorge Jesus was dismissed in December, and his win in Amsterdam was only his seventh in 15 games. Liverpool have been in exceptional form, winning 14 of 18 inside 90 minutes this year. Of the other four, two were in two-leg ties they won, one in the Carabao Cup final which they won on penalties and the other a 2-2 against the European champions, Chelsea. With Luis Díaz added to the forward line in January, Jürgen Klopp has described this as the greatest squad he has managed.

3/19/2022,"It will be no surprise if Chelsea executives approach the double doors leading into the Riverside Stadium’s boardroom with an element of trepidation on Saturday evening. Whoever among the Stamford Bridge hierarchy imagined that it might be a good idea to pick a fight with Steve Gibson this week swiftly learned a harsh lesson as, quite justifiably, Middlesbrough’s famously feisty owner raked his metaphorical studs down their shins. With sanctions imposed on Chelsea’s outgoing owner, Roman Abramovich, by the UK government dictating they can no longer sell match tickets, the London club demanded that Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final on Teesside be played behind closed doors for “reasons of sporting integrity”. Shortly after Gibson had declared that, among several other things, Bruce Buck, Chelsea’s chairman “lacked intellect” and the London club were “rotten to the core”, the demand was dropped. Accordingly the Riverside will be filled to near-35,000 capacity with only about 700 seats occupied by those away fans who bought tickets before the imposition of sanctions on a Russian owner with ties to Vladimir Putin. All ticket receipts will be donated to Ukrainian war victims and related charities. “I agree with the sanctions and I think our club handled that nonsense magnificently well,” said an approving Chris Wilder on Friday as he prepared to pit his promotion-chasing Championship side against the European champions. “Steve, in his honest, blunt and forthright manner said it how it was.” By kick-off Gibson’s mood may have mellowed and his thoughts may have turned to recollections of a watershed Saturday afternoon in late August 1995 when the newly built Riverside staged its first game. Thanks to goals from Craig Hignett and Jan Åge Fjørtoft, Bryan Robson’s team won 2-0. A Chelsea side managed by Glenn Hoddle and featuring Ruud Gullit at sweeper had hoped to brush aside recently promoted opponents, but that defeat rather set the tone for a somewhat mediocre season in which they finished 11th in the Premier League, one place ahead of Boro. Given history’s habit of repeating itself, Chelsea fans may be disinclined to recall that football’s spotlight was then dominated by a Newcastle team revitalised by Sir John Hall’s takeover and Kevin Keegan’s inspirational management. Newcastle would eventually allow the title to slip from their grasp and finish second behind Manchester United but, 26 years on, a Saudi Arabian-led buyout has transformed them into potentially the world’s wealthiest club. No one knows whether a new Chelsea ownership faced with the prospective challenge of reconstructing or replacing Stamford Bridge will be able, or even inclined, to take on an ascendant Newcastle, let alone Manchester City, Liverpool et al, in the transfer market. Moreover, despite Thomas Tuchel’s repeated protestations of happiness in west London it would not be a huge shock were the German to defect to Manchester United this summer. By then Wilder hopes Boro will be back in the Premier League. As part of his preparation for Saturday’s tie, the former Sheffield United manager watched Chelsea beat Newcastle 1-0 last Sunday and he departed Stamford Bridge determined to return on a league assignment with his players next season. “It brought back some really good memories and hammered home that it’s where we really want to be,” said Wilder. “It’s a special division the majority of the world’s best managers and players want to be part of.” Significantly Gibson represents a big reason why England’s top tier has become so enticing to so many. In 1995 when the then Chelsea owner, Ken Bates, became distracted by disagreements with his vice-chairman, Matthew Harding, Gibson was busy plotting to make his club as global as his international chemical distribution business, Bulkhaul. That August, Fjørtoft, Gullit and Chelsea’s Russian goalkeeper Dmitri Kharine – now coaching at non-league Hemel Hempstead – were the only non-British and non-Irish players on view at the Riverside but two months later the Premier League’s topography shifted when Gibson secured Juninho’s £5m signing. As Boro officials talked the Brazil attacking midfielder out of an initial desire to live next door to that Aladdin’s cave otherwise known as Marks & Spencer in the town centre, Gibson and Robson spearheaded a revolution destined eventually to draw, among others, Abramovich and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to the Premier League. As Chelsea fans continued to mourn Harding’s death in a helicopter crash, the Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli arrived on Teesside from Juventus for £7m at the start of the 1996-97 season. When he scored a hat-trick against Liverpool on his debut it became clear precisely why Boro had elected to spend £40,000 a week on making him the best-paid player in Premier League history. With the Brazilian midfielder Emerson and Italian defender Gianluca Festa arriving from Porto and Internazionale respectively that longstanding Boro footballers Mecca, the Tall Trees nightclub in the nearby Georgian market town of Yarm, assumed a newly exotic vibe. Similar glamour swiftly spread south, enveloping Stamford Bridge. With Hoddle departing to coach England, Gullit became Chelsea’s manager in the summer of 1996 and wasted no time in recruiting Gianfranco Zola, Ginalucca Vialli, Roberto Di Matteo and Frank Leboeuf. The following May, the Dutchman led Chelsea to their first trophy success in 26 years: a 2-0 FA Cup win against soon-to-be-relegated Boro. Wilder, after beating Manchester United and Tottenham in earlier rounds, hopes to ensure Chelsea do not reach Wembley and seems slightly disappointed an increase in their government-controlled travel allowance means they journeyed to Teesside by air rather than road. “From my viewpoint there’s not a lot of sympathy towards Thomas and the players,” said Boro’s manager. “But I don’t think there’s an incredible amount of sympathy for them anywhere in football.”",Sport/Football,Steve Gibson and sanctions leave Chelsea facing tough tie at Riverside,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/steve-gibson-and-sanctions-leave-chelsea-facing-tough-tie-at-riverside
3/19/2022,"They say it’s a woman’s prerogative to change her mind but such is Rachael Blackmore’s quiet determination to be known first and foremost as just a jockey, rather than a female one, that it ought to have come as no surprise that she stuck to her guns and elected to ride A Plus Tard in this year’s Gold Cup despite being beaten into second place on him 12 months ago. While the novelty value of Blackmore’s gender in a massively male dominated, often brutal profession has gradually dissipated to the point where it barely merits a mention, it is worth noting for the record that she has achieved yet another historic milestone in becoming the first woman in the 98-year history of the race to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup. She did so in fine style, pulling 15 lengths clear of Minella Indo, the reigning champion and one of two Henry de Bromhead-trained runners in the 11-strong field that Blackmore could have requested the leg-up on. Decisions, decisions. On the eve of the race, Blackmore had said she was “really looking forward” to renewing her Gold Cup acquaintance with A Plus Tard, but we can only imagine the internal anguish that came with being so spoiled for what amounted to a coin-toss choice. Had she decided to swap, ride Minella Indo and lose to A Plus Tard, her judgment would almost certainly have been called into question by an army of armchair jockeys who have never ridden anything more temperamental or subject to the vagaries of form as a bicycle. Had Minella Indo prevailed again without her on board, her decision to stick with A Plus Tard would have looked similarly foolish, bordering on stubborn. To the untrained eye, it looked as if Blackmore might have blown it as she watched her mount’s stable companion begin to pull away at the third last. Stuck behind a wall of four horses, she and A Plus Tard looked to have no visible way through. Unperturbed, horse and rider bided their time and in her post-race debrief, Blackmore said the galloping equine roadblock lined across her strip of track had actually worked to her advantage by preventing her from jumping the gun and going too soon. Push came to predictably vigorous shove at the business end of the race, when she squeezed through a narrow gap that opened between Protektorat and Al Boum Photo before flicking the switch and sending A Plus Tard to hunt Minella Indo down. “I knew I had more horse under me approaching the last than last year,” said Blackmore, who was modest enough not to mention that A Plus Tard also had a lot more jockey than 12 months ago on his back. Since finishing second last year, Blackmore has added the Grand National and a second Champion Hurdle – among other notable pots – to an increasingly stellar CV. Having had her fairytale breakthrough at Cheltenham 12 months ago somewhat spoiled by Covid and her incorrect choice of Gold Cup mount, for the second time this week Blackmore was once again allowed to enjoy the warm and raucous welcome back to the winner’s enclosure which was denied to her last year. The most popular Festival-winning jockey since her retired colleague Ruby Walsh, it is a measure of the high regard in which she is held that despite saddling three winners earlier in the afternoon, a beaming Willie Mullins made his way to the chute through which she was parading towards the winner’s enclosure to give her a big thumbs-up. Also in attendance in his role as co-owner of third-placed Protektorat: serial winner Sir Alex Ferguson, who looked similarly pleased as he gave her what looked suspiciously like a wave. Of course Blackmore and A Plus Tard’s success meant that there could be no win for the well-fancied Galvin, which was ridden by Davy Russell and trained by Gordon Elliott. Having served his ban for an almost unfathomable act of stupidity which led to millions around the world seeing him photographed sitting astride a dead horse 13 months ago, Elliott may well have earned his shot at redemption but the sight of him grinning on board the most prestigious podium in racing at the first time of asking since the renewal of his licence would almost certainly have come too soon for a general public who might in time be willing to forgive but will almost certainly never forget. “You can’t do this without the horses and being attached to Henry’s yard is just absolutely phenomenal,” said Blackmore in her post race interview with ITV. “To give me this horse is unbelievable. I don’t know what to say. I’ve had so many special days. I wouldn’t swap the Grand National for anything, but this is the Gold Cup. I wish I had something better to say right now. I just can’t.” This is a constant, almost apologetic post-race refrain of Blackmore’s: one in which she repeatedly feels the need to explain how bad she feels at not having the requisite vocabulary to put her increasingly regular post-race feelings of euphoria into words. It really matters not one whit – as long as she continues to let her riding do the talking, it’s difficult to imagine that too many punters will care.",Sport/Sport,Rachael Blackmore reaps Gold Cup reward for sticking with old friend | Barry Glendenning,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/18/rachael-blackmore-lets-her-riding-do-the-talking-after-gold-cup-triumph-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing
3/19/2022,"In the end it was probably the private zoo that did it. Or the hall of mirrors. Or the talk in the bread queues of drunken banquets where the mille-feuille flowed like wine. Perhaps it was the queen’s private faux-rustic village where she pretended to be a farmhand while glugging porcelain jugs of cream at her marbled bench. I don’t know about you, fellow peasants. But I feel objectified. Either way historians agree that the March on Versailles, a key event in the French revolution, was sparked by the sense that all this boundless excess – those mirrors, the cream, that alpaca – was in the end just a little too much. Reading the details this week of Erling Haaland’s proposed transfer from Borussia Dortmund to [A Massively Wasteful Super Club], it was tempting to wonder what it might take for football to feel something similar. The anger and alienation around sport is very real but also diffuse, distracted by the lights. Perhaps it will take some hard details to focus the energy. How much is too much? How much more are we willing to consume passively from beyond those long French windows? According to the latest figures floating around Haaland’s move will cost £300m all in. That figure includes wages, sale fee and worst of all an estimated £30m cut for the agent Mino Raiola. Raiola has added nothing to the spectacle. But he will still receive a sum eight times the amount Sport England puts into grassroots football each year for doing not much more than a spell-check on some contracts and clamping himself like a parasitic homunculus to this divine, hard-honed talent. It is tempting to simply goggle at the this gratuitous excess. But it is also vital to remember that this is real money: it’s your TV subscription, your match ticket, your advertising value. It’s every underfunded point of access, every club in danger of going to the wall. Just as the bellows of triumph at each new broadcast deal are the sound of someone else selling this shared treasure back to you for an exorbitant cut. Then of course there’s the game itself. What is the combined effect of these strange forces? Haaland is already a remarkable figure. There has never been a talent quite like this, so obviously compelling (and he is staggeringly good) and so relentlessly commodified. This is the first star footballer not just processed through the modern machine but born into it, to the extent the midwife probably insisted on a sell-on clause on the delivery table. His talent is so obvious, such a known quality. There are early stories of his dramatic promotion from the under-fives to the under-sixes. Has there ever been such a sense of inevitability, of bolt-on success ready to be cashed in by the wealthiest party? At times it feels as though this has already happened, that we are already standing outside it tallying up the numbers, the shiny pots, basking in the hall of mirrors. It is a tribute to the scale of Haaland’s talent, and to the game itself, that he is still fascinating. Those who saw his father play will remember a really good bad footballer. This is not a slight. English football was like that. Haaland Sr, who kicked the ball like a steam engine shunting a cart, who moved at right angles like a mobile crane manoeuvring, was good enough to win that first battle for space and time. Erling is something else altogether. Watch him and immediately the pitch looks too small, the game too simple, the other players too flawed. There is no real element of surprise here, no corners, just a player able to execute every basic skill with supercharged technique, power, conviction. He moves in straight lines because straight lines are the best lines. He scores goals because goals are good and make you win. Watch his Bundesliga highlights reel back and at first you think, OK, he loves crosses. He just has that preternatural eye for finding space, a skill that would make him utterly irresistible at Manchester City. But before long teammates are discovering he can do anything, from cute diagonal runs to headers to balls pulled out of the air via some kind of time-freezing power, to moments where he takes possession in his own half, devours the ground like he hates it, and annihilates the ball into the furthest corner past some poor cowering human. He doesn’t get bored or seek unnecessary variation. He doesn’t want to stop or fall over (Haaland is 120th on the list of 139 most-fouled regular strikers in Europe). Is it entertaining? Can you love this? Even with Kylian Mbappé, more of a one-off, self-made player, there is a sense of edge, fragility, the unexpected. With Haaland you just wonder about the numbers. How many can he score? How much can he win? Which of the available super-teams will he make into the winning super-team? This of course an illusion born out of his style, an appearance of easy efficiency that comes from that same old place, talent and hard work. And there is jeopardy here. Haaland has had injuries and missed games in the last year. No real cause for concern, but he has also played 200 games already, processed through every level as the asset, the show, the thing to be stretched to its limits. There are other kinds of drama too. Signing for Manchester City would be a deeply logical step. Everything in this equation points to success. But let’s face it, given the maths of this, the feeling of irresistible forces gathering, failure would be so much more of a twist. More importantly, can he remain happy? Will we break him? Haaland seems smart, fun and mischievous enough to survive this process. Quite what the numbers, the leeching of wealth, the extreme monetising of an extreme talent does to the rest of our game is another question.",Sport/Football,Erling Haaland and the £300m question: how much is too much? | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/18/erling-haaland-and-the-300m-question-how-much-is-too-much
3/19/2022,"Last week the France coach, Fabien Galthié, invited a special guest to address his squad before their trip to Cardiff. And so, into this room of brawny, outsized men steps the author and philosopher Charles Pépin, who proceeds to pepper the players with gnomic rhetorical questions. “What is a beautiful team?” he asks. “What is a real team? Is it ultimately nothing more mysterious than a sum of talents? Or is it something more?” It’s interesting, by way of contrast, to speculate on who might conceivably deliver an equivalent lecture to the England camp. You may remember that a few years ago, the guest speaker invited by Eddie Jones to address his team ahead of the World Cup was the former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane. And perhaps there is a certain cultural divide at work here. In France, a country that has always had a healthy esteem for public intellectuals, it is sport that can learn lessons from wider society. The very opposite is true in this country: here sporting currency possesses its own insoluble and universal mystique, as evidenced by the fact that one of our most celebrated popular philosophers is a guy who used to play table tennis. But then in many ways this is also a trait specific to Galthié himself: a coach who for better or worse has always sought to challenge his players, to provoke them, to rip them out of their comfort zone and force them to confront new problems. Before their grand slam showdown in Paris on Saturday night, there has been a good deal of talk about how a young French team will cope with this entirely new scenario: a potential first clean sweep since 2010, the sort of pressure and stress that can force players to crack. Yet in another sense France have spent the last two years in a state of high stress because that is simply the nature of playing under Galthié: a restless, ruthless and divisive coach whose perfectionism, according to those who have played under him, verges on obsession. At half-time against Wales last week, his dissatisfaction was palpable, despite his side’s 10-9 lead. “Twice they scored three points from opportunities that you gave to them,” he railed bitterly in the Cardiff dressing room, directly addressing No 8 Grégory Aldritt and singling him out for blame in front of his teammates. In contrast, it is usually the other coaches and senior players who take on the responsibility of delivering more uplifting, positive messages. At times like this, one is reminded of the many criticisms of Galthié that have accumulated over the course of his career, often in regard to his man-management skills: a blunt, brusque manner high on censure and low on sentiment. “Humanely, you are worthless,” the former Stade Francais wing Raphaël Poulain once told him. “You shouldn’t be allowed to coach. You rip up your players like a dog feeding on scraps of meat.” This extends to Galthié’s relationship with the media. “There are no Toulousains in the French team,” he snapped on Thursday at a reporter who pointed out that there were nine Toulouse players in his starting XV. “Or Bordelais, Clermontois or Parisians. This is our French team.” Yet, thus far, all the signs are that the Galthié method is enjoying remarkable success. A team stuffed with talent and secure in its own supremacy has responded in electrifying fashion, building on its progress last autumn and storming to the verge of a grand slam. Perhaps the most impressive element of this French side is its lack of discernible weaknesses: outstanding carriers in the pack, matchwinners all over the backline, a strong kicking game and an ever-present running threat. International rugby at the highest level is as much a game of eliminating flaws as accentuating strengths, and it is in this respect that Galthié has left his deepest imprint. Such is the assurance of this French side that you occasionally get the impression their biggest fear is not the opposition but their own complacency. If everyone does their jobs, they win. The contrast with England here is stark, and particularly with Jones, a coach who seems to revel in playing up his team’s limitations, hedging their chances, toying with expectations, even bizarrely suggesting that this game is simply an acclimatisation exercise for the next World Cup. “Six weeks together, we don’t fuck it up now,” François Cros urged his teammates in Cardiff last week, and we can expect a similar attitude against the English, where the odds will be loaded in their favour. If France do manage to keep their heads and bring their A-game on a clear and crisp Paris night, it is England who will be facing the deep and meaningful questions.",Sport/Sport,"Restless, ruthless, obsessive … but Galthié has France reaching new heights | Jonathan Liew",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/fabien-galthie-france-six-nations
3/19/2022,"Joe Biden spoke for nearly two hours with Xi Jinping as the US sought to dissuade China from backing Russia’s war on Ukraine. A White House account of the call on Friday said that the US president “described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians”. A senior administration official said there would be consequences “not just for China’s relationship with the United States, but for the wider world”, but would not give more details on whether Biden had gone into specifics on possible sanctions, other than to point out what had happened to Russia as an example. “The president really laid out in a lot of detail the unified response from not only governments around the world, but also the private sector to Russia’s brutal aggression in Ukraine,” the official said. “The president made clear that there would likely be consequences for those who would step in to support Russia at this time.” Biden did not make any direct requests to Xi to persuade Putin to end the attack. “The president really wasn’t making specific requests of China. He was laying out his assessment of the situation … and the implications of certain actions,” the official said. “Our view is that China will make its own decisions.” The Chinese account of the conversation in the state news agency, Xinhua, said it was “candid and in-depth” but gave little detail about Ukraine. The report said that Xi expressed the wish that the war was not happening, but gave no sign of what the Chinese leader’s intentions were towards support for Moscow. Xi said the situation in Ukraine had developed to such a point “that China does not want to see” according to the report, which stuck to Beijing’s policy of avoiding the words “war” or “invasion”. Beijing’s readout of the call did not suggest any Chinese role in ending the war. It quoted Xi as referring to a favourite aphorism, “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger’s neck take it off”, a seeming reference to China’s position that the US and Nato are ultimately to blame for Vladimir Putin’s actions. Beijing blames the war on Nato’s refusal to rule out future Ukrainian membership of the alliance, and western supplies of weapons to the country. Xi also expressed concern about the impact on Taiwan, which he has vowed to restore to rule from Beijing. Xi claimed “some people in the United States are sending the wrong signals to the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces, which is very dangerous”. “If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the relationship between the two countries,” Xi added. The US “One China” policy acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China, but Washington does not recognise Beijing has sovereignty over the island. Before the call, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Biden would question Xi about Beijing’s “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia’s invasion. US officials fear that Xi has already decided to give Russia economic assistance and some military aid, though it unclear what difference Chinese arms supplies would make on the battlefield, as the more sophisticated weapons, like drones, would not be compatible with Russian equipment. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, both had hour-long conversations with Putin on Friday morning, According to Scholz’s office, the German leader had “put pressure on [Putin] to introduce a ceasefire as soon as possible, to improve the humanitarian situation and to make progress in the search for a diplomatic solution for the conflict”. A spokesman gave no details on whether any progress had been made, adding that the conversation had been focused on the war and attempts to stop it. In the Kremlin’s version of the conversation, put out ahead of the statement from Berlin, it was described as “harsh but businesslike”, with Putin complaining about war crimes he said had been committed by the Ukrainian army, referring to attacks he said had taken place in the eastern cities of Donetsk and Makiivka that had led to “numerous deaths”. “These war crimes are being ignored by the west,” Putin said according to Russian news agency reports referring to the Kremlin. Putin reportedly told Scholz the Russian army “is doing everything to avoid civilian victims”. According to the Kremlin’s account, Putin accused Ukraine of trying to “slow down” the discussions with Russia, and said that the government in Kyiv was making “unrealistic suggestions”. It added that the Russian leadership was “ready to seek solutions appropriate to its basic views”. The Kremlin account of Putin’s call with Macron said the Russian president had talked about the Kremlin’s approach to peace talks with Ukraine but gave no details. The Elysée Palace said Macron had said he was “extremely concerned” about Mariupol, which has suffered constant shelling. According to the Kremlin version, Putin repeated the claim that Russian forces were doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties. The US, UK, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway have all accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, and the prosecutor at the international criminal court has begun collecting evidence. The UN’s international court of justice has ordered Russia to halt its invasion, declaring that it had no evidence to support Russian claims, used to justify the attack, that Ukrainian forces were committing genocide against Russian speakers in the east of the country. The UN security council met on Friday to hear a repetition of Russia’s unsubstantiated claims, circulated after the invasion as a justification, that Ukraine had run biological weapons laboratories with US help. “The UN was clear that there was no evidence. It was nonsense then. It’s nonsense now,” the UK permanent representative, Barbara Woodward, said afterwards. “And as far as we’re concerned, frankly, this is the disinformation of the desperate. Things are clearly not going well for Russia in Ukraine.”",News/US news,Joe Biden warns Xi Jinping of ‘consequences’ if China backs Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/joe-biden-xi-jinping-call-china-russia-ukraine
