2/3/2022,"The battery technology startup Britishvolt and its backer, the FTSE 100 metals and mining firm Glencore, have announced plans to build a plant capable of recycling lithium-ion batteries used in cars and electronic devices. The two firms plan to use 100% renewable energy to recycle batteries at Britannia Refined Metals, owned by Glencore, at a site in Northfleet in Kent that was previously home to the UK’s largest coal-fired power station.  Once up and running, with the opening planned for 2023, the plant will be capable of recycling a minimum of 10,000 tonnes of lithium-ion batteries a year, equivalent to 50,000 electric car batteries. The plant will be able to process batteries from cars and portable electronic devices, as well as processing scrap from Britishvolt’s planned “gigafactory” in Blyth, Northumberland, transported to Kent by barge to limit carbon emissions. The government said last month that it would invest £100m in Britishvolt to help jumpstart the car battery manufacturer’s plans to build the facility, which it says will be able to produce 300,000 battery packs for electric cars each year. Britishvolt said the investment, via the Automotive Transformation Fund, would enable long-term partnership with the fund managers Tritax and abrdn to deliver £1.7bn in private funding for the construction of the shell and core of the gigafactory. “Recycling is key to a successful energy transition and has always been a major part of Britishvolt business model,” said Timon Orlob, the chief operating officer of Britishvolt. “We’ve been looking for the perfect partner to help kickstart a UK battery recycling industry and FTSE 100-listed Glencore has expert historical experience in recycling.” He said the joint venture would help create a “truly sustainable battery value chain, create jobs and develop new battery recycling technologies. “Both Britishvolt and Glencore are fully committed to reducing carbon across the supply chain.” According to Faraday Institution, a battery research body, there are no substantial recycling facilities for lithium-ion battery packs in the UK, leading to manufacturers exporting used batteries to European facilities instead. Greenpeace data suggests that about 12.85m tonnes of EV lithium-ion batteries will go offline between 2021 and 2030. Britishvolt is still in the early phase of its plans to build a gigafactory that it says could start production in 2024, helping kickstart a battery manufacturing revolution as the UK aims to cut emissions. Glencore has previously come in for criticism over its environmental record, given its role in the global extraction and trade of minerals and fossil fuels. In December, it defended plans to build a coalmine in Queensland, Australia, after telling the federal government more than a dozen threatened species could be on the site. It has also faced scrutiny over sulphur dioxide emissions in Zambia. But in recent years, it has been at pains to burnish its green credentials, predicting that its carbon footprint would shrink by almost a third by 2035.",News/Business,Britishvolt and Glencore to build plant capable of recycling lithium-ion batteries,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/britishvolt-and-glencore-to-build-plant-capable-of-recycling-lithium-ion-batteries
2/3/2022,"Labor said this week it will back a gas-fired power plant in the Hunter Valley, but only if the gas is mixed with hydrogen. The rationale for this move, according to Labor, was the Morrison government’s $600m support for the project was “risking taxpayers’ money on a gas plant that experts say will become stranded in an increasingly renewable energy system”.  Starting up the Snowy Hydro plant with at least 30% hydrogen – and eventually upgrading the plant to run entirely on green hydrogen – was also “consistent with net zero emissions by 2050, as well as our commitment to 43% emissions reductions by 2030”. But there are some big doubts from analysts about how much emissions could be saved and whether Labor’s plan would do anything to prevent the plant from becoming a white elephant sitting in the Hunter Valley. The announcement was light on details – a shame because there are some fundamental questions that can’t be answered about the viability of the plant and how clean it might be. But first, some very quick background: the plant at Kurri Kurri is proposed to only come into operation when there are short-term gaps in electricity supply. The government-owned Snowy Hydro has said it expects the plant will only run for about 2% of the year. Some analysts, academics and the former head of the Energy Security Board, Kerry Schott, have said regardless of what the plant runs on, it makes little commercial sense and won’t be needed to firm the supply of electricity anyway. But Labor says it’s backing the plant because it will drive demand for hydrogen from renewables and allow more clean energy to enter the power sector. There’s a problem here. Or at least an important calculus as hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer cash are being committed, with Labor saying more investment would be needed to get the plant to run on 100% hydrogen. First, how much might actually be saved in emissions? A spokesperson for the shadow climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, told Temperature Check the initial requirement to have the plant run on 30% green hydrogen (that is, hydrogen with zero emissions, presumably derived from renewable energy) would relate to the volume of hydrogen being added. Dr Fiona Beck, an expert on the emerging green hydrogen industry at the Australian National University, says that distinction is important. Methane has about three times as much energy by volume as hydrogen. So she says if 30% of the volume of fuel added is hydrogen, you don’t cut emissions by 30%. Rather, you only cut emissions by about 12%. That’s not insignificant, but it’s also not that much for a plant that will hardly ever run in the first place. Adding hydrogen will also push up costs. And it’s going to cost about $600m, and Bowen has said more will need to be spent to allow the plant to burn more hydrogen. Energy analysts have also said that of all the uses for clean hydrogen, blending it in power plants is likely to be one of the least economically viable uses. But Beck says a plant like Kurri Kurri – built to cover only peaks in demand – would also be competing with other technologies that can do the same job, such as batteries or pumped hydro. “You have to think about what else you could be doing with that hydrogen,” she said. “It seems like an expensive way to avoid a small amount of emissions when there are cheaper and less emitting alternatives out there.” In the wake of a Morrison government announcement of $1bn in funding for Great Barrier Reef conservation over the next nine years, one Coalition senator wasn’t impressed. Queensland Liberal National party senator Gerard Rennick complained to journalist David Lipson the cash would “only be used to fund academics who spread alarmist doomsday rhetoric”. He apparently hadn’t read the detail that more than half of the money will go to on-ground projects to improve water quality. Rennick also said the money wasn’t needed and that recent data showed the coverage of coral over the reef was “at an all-time high.” Nope. The Australian Institute of Marine Science has been monitoring coral cover on reefs since the mid-1980s. Its latest monitoring report does not show record coral cover on any of the reef’s three regions – southern, central or northern. What it does show is an increase in coral since back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. And this increase, AIMS has said, was driven by a fast-growing coral species that are also the most susceptible to the next coral-bleaching outbreak. And there are fears the next bleaching event could be unfolding right now, with record ocean temperatures recorded over the reef in December. You might have noticed there’s a bit of a supply crunch going on in some supermarkets. Earlier pandemic shortages of product were down to panic-buying, with some people convinced those who would best survive lockdowns would be those holding the most number of toilet rolls. More recently, there have been supply fears caused by a shortage of a diesel additive, and the current gaps on shelves are due to staff shortages in the supply chain as people catch Covid or isolate themselves. News Corp columnist Vikki Campion, who is engaged to the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, doesn’t want customers abusing young staff (I’m down with that also). But at the weekend Campion took the supply shortage to weave a creative tale where the abuse – and the gaps on shelves – were somehow due to a lack of support for fossil fuels and the resource sector. Corporations looking to cut their emissions were just fawning to “fashionable philosophies” rather than, say, a broad goal backed by financial institutions that manage about US$130tn of investments. Australian corporations didn’t understand how things were made, Campion said, and had instead “swallowed Greta Thunberg’s thundering” rather than, say, absorbing decades of scientific analysis and warnings and being worried they’ll be left with fossil fuel assets that become worthless in a zero-carbon future.",News/Environment,Does Labor’s green hydrogen plan for the Kurri Kurri gas power plant stack up? | Graham Readfearn,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/03/does-labors-green-hydrogen-plan-for-the-kurri-kurri-gas-power-plant-stack-up

2/3/2022,"Having two or more chronic health problems in middle age more than doubles the risk of dementia, according to a study that researchers say underscores the importance of good health earlier in life. More than 900,000 people are living with dementia in the UK, and about 57 million people are affected globally. The worldwide toll is predicted to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050.  Evidence shows that having multiple conditions is common in people living with dementia. But studies examining whether multimorbidity at an earlier age affects the risk of subsequent dementia are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, researchers atUniversity College London and the University of Paris set out to examine the long-term association between multimorbidity at ages 55, 60, 65 and 70 and subsequent dementia. Their findings are based on data collected from more than 10,000 Britons taking part in the Whitehall II study, which is looking at the association of social, behavioural and biological factors on long-term health. All were aged 35 to 55 and free of dementia when they joined the study between 1985 and 1988. For this study multimorbidity was defined as the presence of at least two chronic conditions from a predefined list of 13 types, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure, depression, liver disease, stroke, arthritis and cancer. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that the risk of dementia was greater when these sorts of conditions developed at a younger age (mid-50s) rather than later in life. For every five years younger a person was when multimorbidity occurred up to the age 70 the risk of dementia went up by 18%. From the group of Britons taking part in the Whitehall II study, 7% had two or more conditions aged 55, rising to 32% at age 70. Overall, 639 cases of dementia occurred over an average 32-year follow-up. After adjusting for factors such as socioeconomic status, diet and lifestyle, having two or more conditions aged 55 pushed up the risk of dementia almost 2.5 times compared with people who had none. Developing two or more conditions between 60 and 65 was associated with a 1.5-fold higher risk. For those with three or more chronic conditions at 55 there was a fivefold higher risk of dementia. The risk fell dramatically if people were aged 70 before they developed chronic health conditions. “Given the lack of effective treatment for dementia and its personal and societal implications, finding targets for prevention of dementia is imperative,” the researchers wrote. “These findings highlight the role of prevention and management of chronic diseases over the course of adulthood to mitigate adverse outcomes in old age.” Prof Paul Morgan of the Dementia Research Institute at Cardiff University, who was not involved in the research, described the work as a “landmark study” which he said concluded that the number of chronic health conditions and how long a person had them was “strongly predictive” of dementia risk.",News/Society,Two or more chronic health problems in middle age ‘doubles dementia risk’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/02/two-chronic-health-problems-middle-age-double-dementia-risk-multimorbidity-study
2/3/2022,"More than 1.2 million additional people across North America are expected to die of opioid overdoses by 2029 if dramatic interventions are not taken to prevent it, according to a new study published in the Lancet. Overdose deaths from all drugs, including opioids, have increased dramatically in the US and Canada during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Lancet report, prepared by the Stanford-Lancet commission on the North American Opioid Crisis, is a wide-ranging analysis which seeks to highlight evidence-based recommendations to the opioid crisis. The report predicts that the number of overdoses will “grow exponentially” in the next seven years, killing an additional 1.2 million people. Such a figure would represent a doubling of the number of deaths seen over the last two decades. As long as the status quo stands, “We will continue to have these kinds of addiction outbreaks in our healthcare system,” said Keith Humphreys, chair of the commission and a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University, which financed the commission’s research. The commission emphasized that while specific vulnerabilities in American regulations accelerated the current problem, there was also evidence the opioid crisis had “got a good chance of spreading globally,” Humphreys added. “As we show in [the report], Australia has a 15-fold increase in opioid prescribing. England has doubled. Finland has gone up by a factor of seven. Brazil by 465%,” he said. Provisional data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that during the 12-month period ending in April 2021, more than 100,000 people died in the US of drug overdoses, including more than 75,000 people whose deaths involved opioids. Opioids, a broad class of drugs including prescription painkillers and illicit drugs such as fentanyl and heroin, are involved in about three-quarters of overdose deaths in the US. The number of overdose deaths involving fentanyl has risen sharply since 2015. In North America, more than 600,000 people have died of opioid overdoses since 1999. The opioid epidemic is broadly recognized to have started when drug companies, such as Purdue Pharma, aggressively and fraudulently marketed opioids despite evidence they were being abused and diverted. Humphreys argued that weak regulation, poor addiction treatment services and disinvestment in preventive measures make the US particularly vulnerable to future waves of addiction epidemics involving other drugs. “It may not be opioids, but it may be tranquilizers or stimulants,” said Humphreys. Regardless of the class, he warned, all would cause unnecessary injury and death. In North America, the opioid crisis is largely seen to have occurred in three waves. Widespread prescribing of opioid painkillers in the 1990s led millions, particularly white and Indigenous people living in rural areas, to become addicted. Insufficient addiction treatment resources expanded markets for illicit heroin, and also moved the opioid epidemic into urban centers, expanding their use among Black Americans. Those markets were then flooded with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, leading to recent peaks in opioid overdose deaths. To try to “unwind” the opioid epidemic in the US over the coming years, the commission argued efforts should start by curbing pharmaceutical industry influence on doctors, politicians, regulatory agencies, medical students and the public through industry-supported patient advocacy groups. The commission then calls for opioid stewardship that takes into account both benefits and risks of painkillers; addiction treatment that is part of core public health services; criminal justice reform; investment in healthier communities and childhood education; innovations in biomedical research to find non-addictive painkillers; and lastly a commitment from wealthy nations to enact policies to avoid exporting the opioid crisis to developing countries. Even if lawmakers only tackled the influence of pharmaceutical companies, such a change would represent a dramatic realignment of power in the US. The pharmaceutical and health industry spent more than $352m lobbying members of Congress in 2021. In 2020, the pharmaceutical industry alone donated to two-thirds of sitting members of Congress, or 356 lawmakers, according to the health publication Stat. Humphreys acknowledged such change was daunting, but argued it should not be ignored. “We’re not going to pretend [that] because this is politically impossible at this moment that it’s not an issue – of course it’s an issue, the role of money,” said Humphreys. Previous research by the commission suggested that 25% of the increase in predicted overdose deaths could be averted with widespread distribution of the opioid overdose antidote naloxone.",News/US news,Opioid overdose deaths to ‘grow exponentially’ without action – study,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/02/doubling-opioid-overdose-deaths-global-growth-lancet-stanford-study
