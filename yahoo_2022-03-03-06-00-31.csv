3/3/2022,"Terrifying footage shows the moment the floor at a Colorado home collapsed during a house party, sending over 100 guests crashing through to the basement below. The South Metro Fire Rescue (SMFR), along with deputies from the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office, responded to a home in the 20900 block of Princeton Place in Arapahoe County, Colo., at 9:41 p.m. MST on Feb. 26, according to a Facebook post by SMFR. “A 911 caller reported that ‘people were dying’ and hung up,” the post states. “Upon arrival, emergency personnel observed over 100 juveniles in the street and discovered that a large portion of the first floor collapsed into the basement.” KUSA reports that the homeowners were throwing a birthday party for their 18-year-old grandson when the accident occurred, adding that there is currently no criminal investigation underway. First responders entered the “badly damaged home” and began search and rescue operations. One victim with reportedly serious injures was taken to a nearby hospital, while two more people were hospitalized with less severe injuries. SMFR also said that a natural gas line was ruptured during the incident and had to be shut off to “prevent an explosion and fire.” Multiple videos showing different angles of the incident have since gone viral on TikTok. One clip with over 5.6 million views purports to show the exact moment the crowd plummeted through the floor of the home. Warning: This video may be disturbing to some viewers. Discretion is advised. A second video, which racked up over 8.7 million views, claims to show the collapse from the viewpoint of a partygoer who went to the basement to escape the wild celebration just before the incident took place. TikTok user Monet Kauai, who says she was in attendance at the party and was one of the people that fell through the floor, also shared footage of the destruction, showing multiple teenagers attempting to help each other out of the wreckage. In a subsequent storytime video, Kauai claimed that the collapse occurred when the teens all jumped in unison during a beat drop. “Me and my best friend were … holding hands. I can’t see her because it’s pitch black. All these people are on top of me,” she recalled. “It’s dark, and I’m getting kicked. I’m getting punched … Everybody’s freaking the f*** out.” “The floor is just in shambles,” she added. “Everybody’s just screaming.” An Instagram account belonging to a teen named Marvin Jones III, who claims the incident took place at his birthday celebration, shared photos of what appears to be severe damage sustained to the family house.    A post shared by marvin jones iii (@mvj.3) Jones also shared a link to a GoFundMe set to benefit the homeowners, as organized by Khalilah Hunter. “Hi. I am reaching out to you all for emergency help for two elders in our community,” the page states. “They are in their 70s and currently not able to stay in their home and [are] in a hotel. Until things are worked out, they will need to remain at the hotel.” “Their homeowners deductible is a $1,500 out-of-pocket proof of cost,” the page continued. “Helping them have somewhere to stay safely for a week or two will help cover this out-of-pocket cost.

3/3/2022,"Jaime Harrison said Boebert and Greene ""might as well"" have been wearing trash bags at the State of the Union. ""It was that sitting in the garage for a week type of trash,"" the DNC chair said of their antics. They chanted ""build the wall,"" and Boebert heckled Biden as he discussed his dead son. The reviews are coming in for GOP Reps. Lauren Boebert's and Marjorie Taylor Greene's antics during President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday — and Jaime Harrison, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, was among those less than impressed. In response to a tweet from the former South Carolina state lawmaker Mandy Powers Norrell calling the congresswomen ""trashy,"" Harrison said: ""They might as well have been wearing hefty bags… it was that sitting in the garage for a week type of trash."" Boebert and Greene heckled Biden at various points during his first State of the Union address. They also turned their backs and refused to applaud as Biden entered the chamber. The two congresswomen tried to start a ""build the wall"" chant as Biden spoke about immigration reform, but other Republican lawmakers refused to join in, and one person on the Democratic side of the aisle told them to sit down. Boebert heckled Biden as he was discussing the health effects of toxic burn pits on US service members and veterans, including the role burn pits may have played in his son Beau's death at 46 from brain cancer. ""When they came home, many of the world's fittest and best-trained warriors were never the same. Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness. A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know,"" Biden said. Boebert then shouted, ""You put them in, 13 of them."" ""One of those soldiers was my son Maj. Beau Biden,"" Biden continued. ""We don't know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer or the diseases of so many of our troops. But I'm committed to finding out everything we can."" Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a leading House Democrat, told Insider after the speech that Boebert's outburst was ""disgraceful."" ""I don't know that I belong to the same human race as someone who thinks it makes sense to yell at someone when they're talking about their dead son,"" he said. Harrison compared the outburst to when GOP Rep. Joe Wilson shouted ""You lie!"" at President Barack Obama during a joint address of Congress in 2009. ""After Joe Wilson's 'You Lie' embarrassment a few years ago you would have thought the GOP would have potty trained their unruly toddlers but I guess after last night's disrespectful antics some of the toddlers have become juvenile delinquents,"" Harrison tweeted. The two far-right congresswomen, both elected in 2020, are known for making inflammatory statements and derisive comments and getting into confrontations with their colleagues in the Capitol. Greene, who last year was removed from her committee assignments and was recently permanently suspended from Twitter, is under scrutiny for speaking on Friday at a white-nationalist conference headlined by Nick Fuentes, whom the Anti-Defamation League has described as a ""well-known white supremacist pundit and organizer.""

3/3/2022,"Simon & Garfunkel once described a scenario in which ""friends just can't be found,"" and one can easily imagine that, following Wednesday's United Nations vote condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin and company might find solace in listening to ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" on repeat. According to The New York Times, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russian aggression, with 141 countries voting in favor, 34 abstaining, and only five voting against. The result matched the international outpouring of support for Ukraine seen around the world in the past week. Pro-Ukraine demonstrations sprang up in London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Cape Town, and several other cities. During President Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday, many lawmakers waved small Ukrainian flags or wore Ukrainian flag pins. The no votes on the resolution came from five authoritarian nations: Russia, North Korea, Eritrea, Syria, and Russia's close ally Belarus. The Cato Institute's 2020 Human Freedom Index ranks Russia as the 115th freest country on earth. Belarus barely cracks the top 100 at 99th. Syria appears on the list as the 10th least free country in the world. North Korea and Eritrea, both one-party dictatorships, are not ranked at all. Among the nations that abstained from the vote were Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, and China. In early February, China and Russia released a joint statement that, among other things, condemned NATO expansion but did not directly mention Ukraine. The 5 countries who voted against condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine included Russia, Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria.

3/3/2022,"After a negative experience at work, a woman discovered that a certain word is only ever used to describe female employees. Katrina Palanca uses her TikTok account to share stories that empower AAPI women in their career journeys. The influencer recounted a time at work when a male co-worker labeled her “abrasive.” After feeling upset about the comment, Palanca did some research of her own on the term. What she learned was enlightening. “There’s a word that’s almost always used to describe women and hardly ever used to describe men,” Palanca said. “I’m going to tell you about the time I was called that word.” When Palanca was preparing for a new hire at work, she ran into an issue with her co-worker “Steve” from the IT department. She had requested the IT department set up the new hire’s computer before their first day. After a few days, Palanca went to follow up on the request. She spoke in a “matter-of-fact” tone that was the “equivalent of not putting exclamation points in an email.” But Steve didn’t take it too well. “A couple of hours later, my boss comes to my cubicle, he grabs a chair, sits down next to me,” Palanca recalled. “And [he] says, ‘Hey, you’re not in trouble. I just want you to know that Steve from IT came into my office and said that you were being abrasive.’“ Although Palanca didn’t get in trouble at work, the word “abrasive” left her feeling unsettled. She discovered a study by linguist Kieran Snyder, who reviewed 248 performance reviews from 28 small and large companies. Snyder found the word “abrasive” was used 17 times to describe 13 women, but men were never called the word once. In fact, the study found that such character critiques appeared in 71 of 94 women’s reviews but were totally absent from men’s reviews altogether. So as it turns out, Palanca’s experience was just one example of the much broader double standards women face at work.

3/3/2022,"Rising home values can quickly transition a reasonable housing market into the type of real estate monster that has consumed places like the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York. While the idea of affordable housing in an urban center isn't implausible for plenty of Americans living in some areas, that's rapidly changing in many places. Find Out: 50 Cities Where It's Cheaper To Buy a Home Than Rent
Ready To Invest? Watch Out: 50 Housing Markets That Are Turning Ugly GOBankingRates conducted a study to determine which major U.S. cities are on track to lose their label of affordability. GOBankingRates took the overall U.S. median home value and projected its growth over 10 years using Zillow's September 2022-23 one-year forecast. This projection was then compared to the projections of 537 U.S. cities that currently have home prices below the national median of $325,677, with those surpassing the national median in the next 10 years (plus its projected growth rate over the same period) being deemed ""not affordable."" Granted, this approach comes with some caveats. Projecting into the future based on a single year's growth rate could ultimately paint an unfair picture in markets where the current rate is an anomaly. Additionally, Zillow's estimated home values don't necessarily reflect the list prices or sale prices in each market. Still, identifying the areas that are outpacing the national average for growth can help shed light on the cities where you should buy a home sooner rather than later. If you end up living in one of these cities 10 years down the line, you might want to check out other, more affordable real estate markets instead.

Methodology: GOBankingRates took the overall U.S. median home value and projected its growth over 10 years using Zillow's September 2022-23 one-year forecast. This projection was then compared to the projections of 537 U.S. cities that currently have home prices below the national median, with those surpassing the national median in the next 10 years (plus its projected growth rate over the same period) being deemed ""not affordable."" For each ""not affordable"" city over the next decade, GOBankingRates found the following factors: (1) year the city will become ""not affordable""; (2) projected home value for that year; (3) U.S. average projected home value for that year; and (4) the difference in value between factors (2) and (3). NOTE: GOBankingRates does not expect growth in home value to stay stagnant at one current rate for the next decade, but using these constant figures gives us an idea where certain markets are heading without unforeseen market disruptors in the future.

3/3/2022,"A Chinese news anchor has quickly drawn attention for the colors of her recent on-air attire, which closely resembled those of the Ukrainian flag.

According to Taiwan News, the anchorwoman for Chinese state-run CCTV4 was reporting that NATO was to blame for Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the time she wore the outfit.

Reddit user u/Semetali uploaded a screenshot of the news anchor wearing a bright yellow button-up blouse with a bright blue blazer, colors similar to those in the Ukrainian flag.

 Many users responded to the post, speculating whether the anchor’s outfit had been worn deliberately to support Ukraine or if the color coordination was just a coincidence. While some contended that the anchor was taking “a stand” or pointed out that the outfit stood out from the usual “neutral colors” worn by Chinese anchors, others believed that it was nothing more than a fashion choice.

“Interesting thing about blue and yellow is that they are complimentary [sic] colors, which means they are colors that make each other pop and look better, which is why you commonly see them paired in outfits, paintings, graphic design and pretty much everywhere,” one user argued. “Maybe she supports Ukraine. Maybe she’s just good at color coordinating outfits.”

Users also argued that the blazer’s color hues differed between the screenshot and the video where the screenshot appears to show a brighter blue while the video shows a more teal-toned blue.

CCTV4 features a mix of English and Chinese language programming and is a part of state-owned China Central Television, or CCTV.

China has not condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and has instead accused the U.S. of causing the conflict. Last week, Horizon News, which operates under Chinese state-owned outlet Beijing News, accidentally leaked editorial instructions on avoiding anti-Russia coverage of the invasion, NextShark previously reported.

3/3/2022,"Ashton Kutcher — who's been showing his support for Ukraine, where wife Mila Kunis was born — is calling on his social media following to deliver a message to Russian citizens. ""If you know someone from Russia, call them and tell them their media is lying to them,"" The Ranch actor, 44, wrote in a Twitter post in both English and Russian on Monday. ""Ukraine doesn't want to fight, they just don't want Putin's government and don't want to be occupied."" Kutcher also shared tweets from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky saying that the lodging service is offering free housing to 100,000 refugees fleeing from Ukraine amid Russia's invasion. (Kutcher is an investor in the company.) Over 520,000 refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia waged war last week, the United Nations has estimated. The U.N. expects the total to reach 4 million in coming weeks. Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the invasion, which has seen Russia try to take over Ukrainian cities while the country's army — and armed citizens — fight back. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed European Parliament on Tuesday, saying, ""We are fighting just for our land and for our freedom,"" adding, ""Nobody's going to break us. We are strong. We're Ukrainians. We have a desire to see our children alive. I think it's a fair one. Yesterday, 16 children were killed."" When Russia invaded last week, Kutcher took to Twitter to say, ""I stand with Ukraine."" The assumption is that he's speaking on behalf of his family as Kunis, 38, does not have public-facing social media accounts. Kunis, who married Kutcher in 2015, was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, when it was still part of the former Soviet Union. At age 7, her family moved to the United States — with just $250. Kunis has said her parents, who reside near her in Los Angeles, didn't tell her they were moving to a different country when they left, amid the fall of communism. The family, along with her older brother Michael boarded a train to Moscow. From there, they flew to Los Angeles on a refugee visa. She started school days later. ""I literally had no clue of a different continent let alone a different language or people or diversity,"" she said on a HouzzTV special in which she gave her parents condo — which they have lived in since 1992 — a makeover. Moving to L.A. ""was all very jarring and very shocking."" She told The Telegraph in 2011 that she blocked out second grade completely and doesn't ""have any memories... My parents tell me, I cried every morning and when I came back from school."" However, she soon adapted. Kunis's dad had worked as a mechanical engineer and her mother was a physics teacher in Ukraine but their degrees and jobs didn't transfer. So they pursued new professions in the U.S. with her dad becoming a cab driver — and doing other odd jobs — and her mom worked at Rite Aid. While Kunis landed her role on That '70s Show in 1998 — with future husband Kutcher — she also a job at Rite Aid with her mom. ""My mom would pick me up from '70s Show, and she'd take me to work with her,"" she told Elle in 2014. ""I'd have to work the ice cream counter or photo counter until closing all the time."" Kunis said in her 2011 interview with The Telegraph, ""Nowadays, if you have money you think Moscow or wherever is great. But that’s not the reality of the Russia I grew up with."" Kunis now has two children of her own with Kutcher: daughter Wyatt, 7, and 5-year-old son Dimitri.",World/Yahoo Celebrity,Ashton Kutcher continues to show support for Mila Kunis's native Ukraine: 'If you know someone from Russia ... tell them their media is lying to them',https://news.yahoo.com/ashton-kutcher-show-support-mila-kunis-native-ukraine-191547011.html
3/3/2022,"Ford is splitting into two auto businesses: one for electric cars and one for combustion ones. The electric unit will be called Ford Model e, a name the company barred Tesla from using years ago. Elon Musk wanted to call Tesla's third mass-produced car, the Model 3, the Model E. Ford announced a major restructuring on Wednesday, saying it will create two auto businesses: one focused on traditional combustion engines and another dedicated to the company's burgeoning electric-vehicle efforts. The name Ford chose for the latter should ring a bell for Elon Musk. The gasoline division will be called Ford Blue, while its EV counterpart will be known as Ford Model e, a name the Detroit automaker stopped Tesla from using nearly a decade ago. After the release of Tesla's Model S and Model X, Musk planned to name the company's third major vehicle the Model E. (It spells ""sex,"" get it?) ""A friend asked me at a party, 'What are you going to name the third-generation car?' Well, we have the S and the X, so we might as well make it the E,"" Musk told CNN Money in 2014. But Ford called up Musk threatening to sue if Tesla pursued the Model E trademark, he told the outlet. Tesla and Ford entered a contract in 2010 that prohibited Tesla from using the Model E name, and the companies resolved the dispute amicably, a Ford spokesperson told CNN Money. —Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017 Ford has sued to keep companies from using the Model E name, arguing it sounds too similar to the Model T. Ford sold cars including the Model A, B, C, F, and K, but never a Model E. In 2000, Ford sued a car-leasing startup called Model E. Tesla kept with the suggestive theme anyway, coming out with the Model 3 sedan instead, and later the Model Y SUV. Ford says that splitting into two units will help boost profits and streamline operations. The reorganization will allow engineers, designers, and other Ford employees to focus on either EV or gasoline efforts, rather than splitting their time between the two, the company said. Ford said the new structure will help it nearly double profit margins by 2026, the same year it plans to produce more than 2 million electric cars.

3/3/2022,"The U.S. and Europe effectively cut off Russia's economy Monday as a way to push Russian President Vladimir into abandoning his increasingly bloody invasion of Ukraine. Even Switzerland, a favorite home for the money of ultra-wealth Russians, said Monday it will comply with the EU sanctions and asset freezes of certain oligarchs close to Putin. The measures are hitting everyone in Russia, but they are aimed at Putin's inner circle. The White House on Saturday announced a new transatlantic task force ""to identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs — their yachts, their mansions, and any other ill-gotten gains."" Russian oligarchs own some of the world's most expensive yachts and private jets, and they apparently want to keep them. ""Some of Russia's wealthiest are moving their boats to other locations, potentially with the hope they can avoid having those items seized,"" CNBC reported Monday. One Ukrainian mechanic on a Russian super-yacht docked in Mallorca, Spain, took matters into his own hands on Saturday, Spain's Ultima Hora reported. The mechanic, Taras Ostapchuk, saw a video of Russian missiles striking an apartment complex in Kyiv and decided to sink the $7 million yacht, the Lady Anastasia, he said is owned by a Russian arms tycoon, his boss. ""I told myself: 'What do I need a job for if I don't have a country?'"" he told Ultima Hora. He opened two valves in the yacht to let in water, then told fellow crew members so they wouldn't drown, Ostapchuk told a judge after police arrested him, The Washington Post reports. ""I don't regret anything I've done, and I would do it again,"" Ostapchuk, 55, told the court, according to Ultima Hora. His lawyer, Neus Canyelles Nicolau, confirmed the details to the Post on Monday and said that her client had been released. Ostapchuk told reporters he is heading back to Kyiv to fight the Russian invaders. Meanwhile, faint cracks are appearing between Putin and ""members of the oligarch class who made billions of dollars while showing fealty to the autocratic leader but now see their fortunes threatened by Western sanctions,"" the Post reports.

3/3/2022,"(Reuters) - Serbia is coming under ""huge pressure"" as it resists joining the European Union, the United States and other countries in imposing sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Wednesday. Serbia is performing a delicate balancing act between its European aspirations, partnership with NATO and its centuries-old religious, ethnic and political alliance with Russia. Vucic said that Serbia had joined a United Nations General Assembly condemnation of Russia's attack on Ukraine, but that no sanctions were implied. Serbia was the only country in Europe which had declined to introduce sanctions against Russia, he added. ""Serbia is in an exceptionally difficult situation, there is less understanding than ever for the position of our nation,"" Vucic said in a televised address. ""We are facing huge pressure."" The country, which relies on Russia for its energy needs, is under pressure to harmonise its foreign policy with that of the EU, which it aims to join. While the EU and Russia have issued tit-for-tat airspace bans, Serbia's flag carrier Air Serbia is still flying between Belgrade and Moscow and has added extra capacity. Vucic said he feared that Serbia might lose its support in the United Nations regarding the status of its former province of Kosovo if Russia is ordered out of the world body. Serbia lost control of Kosovo after a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 to halt killing of ethnic Albanians by Serb forces during a two-year counterinsurgency but still claims the breakaway province as part of its territory. Russia also does not recognise Kosovo's independence.

3/3/2022,"Amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a small portion of the defenders’ arsenal has had a disproportionate effect — Ukraine’s handful of Bayraktar TB2 armed drones. Videos of their exploits have millions of views. They’ve destroyed surface-to-air missile launchers and logistics trains. They’ve inspired songs and are a common refrain in videos taunting the Russian invaders. Despite their small number — around 20, according to pre-war comments made to Al-Monitor — the drones have been heavily utilized, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia, on the other hand, claims it has shot down some of the drones. According to Stijin Mitzer, an open-source intelligence analyst, the small Turkish-made drones have destroyed at least 32 Russian vehicles since war broke out last week, though it’s impossible to independently confirm the total number of vehicles they’ve destroyed. An expert on Russian drone warfare, Samuel Bendett of the CNA think tank, explained to Military Times that even the drones’ limited successes show that Russia is failing to implement its own air defense strategies. He added that Russia studied the lessons learned by Armenia in last year’s war with Azerbaijan, which saw the latter nation decimate Armenian positions and vehicles with Bayraktar drones and loitering munitions. Perhaps the “biggest lesson” of that conflict, Bendett said, was that slow, low flying drones like the Bayraktar are effective against outdated air defense systems. Russian planners were confident that their force structure, which prioritizes modernized, layered air defense, would be able to prevent such a massacre — but “we’re not seeing...what Russians have advertised,” Bendett said. Russian units are usually arrayed in battalion tactical groups, BTGs, with layered air defense and anti-drone capacity, said Bendett. But the forward elements of Russian forces have failed to operate as BTGs in Ukraine, frequently leaving behind their air defense assets “in inexplicable fashion,” he added. “[In Ukraine], Russia doesn’t seem to display the very tactics, techniques and procedures that it’s practiced for years and sought to perfect in Syria...[to provide] adequate cover to its ground forces,” he said. Bendett also pointed towards “the mythology of the Bayraktar” and how “Ukraine is winning the information war.” “For all the Russian military talk about winning information war, they seem to be losing, and the videos of Bayraktars striking what appears to be Russian targets is feeding into that [Ukrainian] information campaign,” he said. #Ukrainian Ground Forces shared a song written for #BayraktarTB2 on its official social media account with a note of ""Punishment of #Bayraktar in the name of #Ukrainian children, Georgians, Syrians, Chechens, and Crimean Tatars."" pic.twitter.com/4HlRxrxbtE — Clash Report (@clashreport) March 1, 2022 Bendett believes that the days of Bayraktar strikes are limited, though, should Russia reorganize its advance. “If the Russian military reorganizes — if it sends in the BTGs, if it sends in adequate air defense capability, if it sends in its [electronic warfare] forces...it would become increasingly more difficult for Bayraktars to operate in an uncontested fashion,” said the drone expert. “They were definitely aware of the threat. They definitely practiced against the threat.” And even should the Russians recover and counter the drone threat, he noted, “they were supposed to eliminate a lot of Ukrainian air defense capability from the...first hours of the campaign.” That includes the air bases where the drones are stored, fueled and equipped. A portion of that responsibility, according to other experts and U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters, lies with the conspicuous absence of the Russian Air Force over the skies of Ukraine. “The fact that there may be surviving [Bayraktars] somewhere is an embarrassment [to Russia],” said Bendett. “Clearly.”",World/Air Force Times,"Ukraine’s drone strikes reveal Russian planning failures, expert says",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-drone-strikes-reveal-russian-223151164.html
3/3/2022,"Robert Person, U.S. Military Academy Associate Professor of International Relations, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the objectives of Russian President Putin, the ceasefire negotiations with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and potential support from EU and NATO if the conflict escalates. [MUSIC PLAYING] ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Welcome back, everybody. Russia has stepped up its assault on Ukraine, now targeting civilian areas in the capital of Kyiv to demoralize the Ukrainian resistance. A United Nations agency reports more than 100 civilian deaths, but said the actual number of casualties could be much higher. Joining me now is Robert Person, Associate Professor of International Relations at the US Military Academy at West Point. Professor, thanks so much for being with us. We know that President Putin would have us believe that his motivation for invading Ukraine is that the country was taking steps to become a member of NATO. I know you wrote an article recently for the Journal of Democracy, debunking that theory. What do you believe is moving Putin? What is he truly afraid of? ROBERT PERSON: I think, first and foremost, Putin is afraid of his own people. I think his number one objective is and always has been to retain his hold on power. I think he's also threatened by democracy in the countries that surround him. Because those countries, countries like Ukraine, that have managed to develop a vibrant thriving democracy in Russia's shadow, set an example for his own countrymen-- an example that threatens him. And so, I think we have seen his position harden and grow ever more extreme, as those countries have attempted to break away and set their own course in democratic Western European politics. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Cease fire negotiations are expected to resume in the coming days. I don't even know if Ukraine NATO membership is on the table anymore. But if Ukraine were to tell Putin that is off the table, we absolutely will not try to join NATO, would that be enough to have him pull out? ROBERT PERSON: I think it's hard to predict right now certainly what Putin is thinking and what he is planning. I should mention that these are all my personal views. They don't represent official policy of the government. But my sense is that really from day one, and going much farther back, Putin's objective in Ukraine has been regime change. Again, he cannot tolerate the idea of Ukraine leaving Russia's orbit and orienting itself towards the West. And so, I think his objective has been to go in, attempt to encircle Kyiv, as we are seeing that drive right now, and ultimately force the Zelensky government out of power through violent means if necessary. So, at this point, I'm not sure that this conflict can necessarily be resolved by taking NATO membership off the table or Ukraine's cooperation with the United States off the table. I think Putin ultimately wants much, much more than that. And we'll see how far he's willing to go to get it. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Ukraine's President Zelensky applied for Ukraine to be part of the European Union. The last time the EU welcomed a new member was Croatia, right. That was back in 2013, and it took them about a decade of negotiations. Is that even realistic? Might the EU actually fast track Ukraine? ROBERT PERSON: I'm not sure it's realistic in the short-term. Again, it's a very lengthy process. It's a very technical process to bring the national laws and regulations and standards of an aspirant member in line with EU requirements. Now, that's a process that has begun with Ukraine signing an association agreement with the European Union, which happened under President Petro Poroshenko a few years back. So, they have been moving in that direction. But it really would be an extraordinary and unprecedented move for the European Union to sort of waive that process or accelerate it to bring Ukraine into the block right now. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Mhm. Professor, there were reports that the EU would supply $0.5 billion of arms, including some fighter jets, to Ukraine. There was a report today-- a reporter from Politico, who's on the ground there, said that Europe will now not transfer fighter planes to Ukraine. Why do you think the about-face? And what are the implications there? ROBERT PERSON: I think, you know, we do have to be concerned about some escalation risk, obviously. The West, NATO, our European partners, are putting extraordinary pressure on Russia right now through a variety of means-- economically, and through the direct military support of the Ukrainian military to include weapons sales. I suspect that there may be a sense-- and here this is just me sort of drawing some inferences and speculating. But I suspect that there may be a sense that a move of providing much more significant weaponry, like fighter jets, could be taken as an escalatory move that might risk dragging a NATO ally more directly into the conflict than we really want to contemplate right now. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Like Poland, I know, which was actually thinking about giving some of those arms, and is a NATO member. President Biden yesterday, when asked by a reporter, said that Americans should not fear Russia's invasion of Ukraine developing into a global nuclear war, despite the fact that Moscow is putting its nuclear forces on high alert after those harsh US sanctions. What are your thoughts on that? I'm sure we'll hear more from the president tonight during a State of the Union. ROBERT PERSON: Yeah, and certainly the president will have, I think, some important updates and perspectives to share with the country and with the world tonight. So, we'll keep our eyes on that. I mean, I think, fundamentally, Putin he is a risk taker. But he, is in my assessment, still a rational actor. He is obviously gambling. I think that gambling has largely failed in Ukraine right now, but he's been extraordinarily consistent in his pursuit of his political goals in Ukraine over the last really nearly decade plus. And so, I think that these threats that we're hearing certainly are part of an escalatory pattern. He hopes that Ukraine supporters internationally will be afraid and will back down. But I think ultimately, he understands that direct military conflict between Russia and between the NATO alliance would unleash devastation that we can hardly imagine. And so, I do believe in the very powerful deterrent effect of that threat and the deterrent effect of a united NATO alliance. ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Well, one thing we have learned, I think, is that never underestimate Vladimir Putin.

3/3/2022,"(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the weekend that his nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert, raising fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear escalation. Here is how Russia's chain of command would work in the event of a nuclear weapon launch. WHO DECIDES TO LAUNCH RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS? A 2020 document https://archive.mid.ru/en/web/guest/foreign_policy/international_safety/disarmament/-/asset_publisher/rp0fiUBmANaH/content/id/4152094 called ""Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence"" says the Russian president takes the decision to use nuclear weapons. A small briefcase, known as the Cheget, is kept close to the president at all times, linking him to the command and control network of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The Cheget does not contain a nuclear launch button but rather transmits launch orders to the central military command - the General Staff. IF PUTIN GIVES THE NUCLEAR ORDER, WHAT HAPPENS? The Russian General Staff file:///C:/Users/8011323/Downloads/FOIR1588.pdf has access to the launch codes and has two methods of launching nuclear warheads. It can send authorisation codes to individual weapons commanders, who would then execute the launch procedures. There is also a back-up system, known as Perimetr, which allows the General Staff to directly initiate the launch of land-based missiles, bypassing all the immediate command posts. DID PUTIN'S 'HIGH ALERT' ORDER MAKE A LAUNCH MORE LIKELY? Putin said at the weekend that the nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert. The following day, Russia's defence ministry announced that its nuclear missile forces had been placed on ""enhanced"" combat duty. The phrase enhanced, or special, combat duty does not appear in Russia's nuclear doctrine, leaving military experts puzzled over what it might mean. Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, said on Twitter that the order might have activated Russia's nuclear command and control system, essentially opening communication channels for any eventual launch order. Alternatively, he said it might just mean the Russians added staff to their nuclear facilities. DO THE RUSSIANS HAVE RULES ON NUCLEAR LAUNCHES? The 2020 doctrine presents four scenarios which might justify the use of Russian nuclear weapons: -- the use of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction against Russia or its allies; -- data showing the launch of ballistic missiles aimed at Russia or its allies; -- an attack on critical government or military sites that would undermine the country's nuclear forces response actions; -- the use of conventional weapons against Russia ""when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy"". WHAT NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES DOES RUSSIA HAVE? The Federation of American Scientists https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces estimates that Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads, more than any other country. Of these, 1,588 are deployed and ready for use. Its missiles can be fired from the land, by submarines and by airplanes. Putin oversaw a coordinated test of Russia's nuclear forces on Feb. 19 shortly before ordering troops into Ukraine. HAS RUSSIA EVER USED A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN WAR? No. To date, the only use of nuclear weapons during conflict was the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in 1945, at the end of World War Two.

3/3/2022,"Kim Jung-ju, the founder of Nexon, South Korea’s largest gaming company, died on Feb. 28 in Hawaii at 54 years old.

NXC, Nexon’s holding company, announced Kim’s death and stated that he had been undergoing treatment for depression, according to The Korea Herald.

He is survived by his two teenage daughters, Kim Jung-min and Kim Jung-youn, and wife, Yoo Jung-hyun.

Nexon CEO Owen Mahoney released a statement that read:, “It is difficult to express the tragedy of losing our friend and mentor Jay Kim, a man who had an immeasurably positive impact on the world. As a founder and visionary leader, Jay encouraged those around him to ignore the skeptics and trust their creative instincts. He will be deeply missed by his Nexon family and many friends.”

Kim launched Nexon in 1994, and it became the first Korean gaming company to earn over $830 million in annual sales within the first year of its debut. Nexon also developed one of the first multiplayer online role-playing games, “The Kingdom of the Winds,” in 1996 and launched one of the world’s most famous games, “MapleStory,” in 2003.

According to Seoulz, Nexon is now the biggest gaming company in South Korea with a market capitalization of $27 billion.

In 2007, the 54-year-old made his debut on Forbes’ Korea’s Richest List where he ranked No. 28 with a net worth of $590 million. In June 2021, Kim officially became the third richest man in South Korea with a total net worth of $10.9 billion, reported Forbes.

After pleading not guilty to bribery charges in 2016 when Kim was indicted of lending money to a close prosecutor friend, he focused on various philanthropic work. According to Forbes, in 2017, Kim founded the venture philanthropy fund C Program, and in 2018, he vowed to donate $93 million to children’s hospitals and startup companies. He also stated that his children would not be inheriting his fortune.

Between 2013 and 2015, his company donated approximately $16.6 million to help build the Purme Foundation Nexon Children's Rehabilitation Hospital in Seoul. Nexon claimed the hospital was the first rehabilitation hospital to be built for children in South Korea.

Prior to his death, Kim continued donating to children’s hospitals in South Korea and had donated a total of $3.1 million to the Daejeon Chung-nam Public Children’s Rehabilitation Hospital as well as $2 million to the Nexon Children’s Palliative Care Center at Seoul National University Hospital, which is planned to open sometime this year.

3/3/2022,"By Joel Schectman, Christopher Bing and James Pearson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Ukrainian cyber guerrilla warfare group plans to launch digital sabotage attacks against critical Russian infrastructure such as railways and the electricity grid, to strike back at Moscow over its invasion, a hacker team coordinator told Reuters. Officials from Ukraine's defense ministry last week approached Ukrainian businessman and local cybersecurity expert Yegor Aushev to help organize a unit of hackers to defend against Russia, Reuters previously reported. On Monday, Aushev said he planned to organize hacking attacks that would disrupt any infrastructure that helps bring Russian troops and weapons to his country. ""Everything that might stop war,"" he told Reuters. ""The goal is to make it impossible to bring these weapons to our country."" Aushev said his group has already downed or defaced dozens of Russian government and banking websites, sometimes replacing content with violent images from the war. He declined to provide specific examples, saying it would make tracking his group easier for the Russians. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. A Ukrainian defense attache in Washington declined to comment on Aushev's group or its relationship with the defense ministry. Aushev said his group has so far grown to more than 1,000 Ukrainian and foreign volunteers. The group has already coordinated with a foreign hacktivist organization that carried out an attack on a railway system. After word spread of the formation of Aushev's team, the Belarusian Cyber Partisans, a Belarus-focused hacking team, volunteered to attack Belarusian Railways because they said it was used to transport Russian soldiers. The Cyber Partisans disabled the railway's traffic systems and brought down its ticketing website, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. On Monday, a Cyber Partisans spokeswoman told Reuters the group carried out those attacks and confirmed her organization was now working with Aushev's group. The spokeswoman said because her group had brought down the reservation system, passengers could only travel by purchasing paper tickets in person. She sent Reuters a photo of a paper, handwritten ticket issued on Monday. ""We fully side with Ukrainians,"" she said. ""They are now fighting for not only their own freedom but ours too. Without an independent Ukraine, Belarus doesn’t stand a chance."" Reuters could not confirm attacks against the Belarus railway's traffic system. The company's reservation website was down on Tuesday afternoon. A railway spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a Russian news outlet on Tuesday that Russian embassies were under cyberattack by ""cyber terrorists from Ukraine."" Beyond striking back at Moscow, Aushev said his team would help Ukraine's military hunt down undercover Russian units invading cities and towns. He said his group had discovered a way to use cellphone tracking technology to identify and locate undercover Russian military units moving through the country, but declined to provide details. Russian troops are reportedly using commercial cell phones in Ukraine to communicate, multiple media outlets reported. Over the last week, numerous Russian government websites have been publicly interrupted by reported distributed denial of service (DDoS) style attacks, including one for the office of President Vladimir Putin.

It's one of several Russian-owned pleasure craft believed to be headed to the sunny island nation, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US. The yacht, Clio, is owned by Oleg Deripaska, the founder of the Russian aluminum group Rusal who was sanctioned by the US in 2018. Clio dropped anchor off Malé, the capital of the Maldives, on Monday, AFP said, citing port officials. At least two other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires set sail for the Maldives shortly after Western nations threatened to seize assets from sanctioned oligarchs, according to data from MarineTraffic reported by CNBC. In a tweet Saturday, the White House said: ""This coming week, we will launch a multilateral Transatlantic task force to identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs — their yachts, their mansions, and any other ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze under the law.""

3/3/2022,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that a third world war would be “nuclear” and “destructive,” essentially warning NATO not to intervene militarily in Ukraine, a day after peace talks failed to temper the bloodshed and as Russian paratroopers descended on the city of Kharkiv, the second largest city in the nation and the epicenter of fierce fighting. Ukraine’s defense ministry confirmed the arrival of Russian airborne troops on Telegram, though it is unclear if they are involved in a ground battle just yet. “There is an ongoing fight between the invaders and the Ukrainians,” they said. Authorities confirmed Wednesday midday that “massive shelling and bombing” as well as urban warfare was underway. Images showed municipal buildings in the city center on fire. Ukraine’s interior minister said that more than 2,000 civilians had already been killed in the six-day-old conflict. Kharkiv was paralyzed by increased fighting Wednesday morning, with Ukrainian Interior Ministry Adviser Anton Gerashchenko confirming that a Russian airstrike ignited the barracks of a flight school that housed some Ukrainian troops. “Practically there are no areas left in Kharkiv where an artillery shell has not yet hit,” he said in a statement on Telegram Wednesday morning. The mayor of Kharkiv said Wednesday that 21 people had been killed in overnight fighting, pushing the death toll higher. Russia also claimed early Wednesday to have taken control of the port city of Kherson, which the Ukrainian military denies. “According to the information from our brigade the battles are going on now,” a Ukrainian military spokesman told CNN. “The city is not captured totally, some parts are under our control.” ‌ Russian troops in a 40-mile long convoy are now around 15 miles from the capital Kyiv as precision attacks slammed a TV tower and devastated a Holocaust memorial site and private maternity clinic on Tuesday continue to “soften” the city for what many believe is an imminent ground invasion. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky gave CNN and Reuters interviews from a fortified bunker deep below a building in Kyiv on Tuesday, the first face-to-face interactions he has had with Western journalists. He told CNN, “Everyone has to stop fighting before we’re ready to talk about peace.” When asked if the negotiations were a waste of time if Russia continued shelling, he said, simply, “We’ll see.” A number of military analysts say that the existence of the convoy backs up Russia’s claim that it does indeed control Ukrainian air space, leaving them unable to attack the somewhat vulnerable convoy. Kyiv's mayor, the former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, vowed to hold the city. “We stayed in front of one of the strongest armies in the world. The will to be independent is (the) main priority for us. And we’re defend(ing) our families, our city, our country, and our future,” he told CNN Wednesday. “There is a huge patriotic movement right now. Old people—can you imagine—doctors, actors, actors from theater, many professions that never had expectation to fight, to keep weapons, but right now they (are) coming to us. They’re ready to fight. It’s amazing.” Reaction inside the war theater to President Joe Biden labeling Vladimir Putin a “dictator” in his State of the Union speech was muted, with analysts predicting the Russian president would not react. “I think those personal comments by Joe Biden were probably things that would get under—into the craw of the Russian president,” CNN’s former Moscow bureau chief and expert on Russian affairs Jill Dougherty said. “Things like ‘dictator, Putin alone is to blame, more isolated than ever.’ But I don’t think they’re going to engage in that. You know, you can’t really defend yourself by saying, ‘No, I’m not a dictator.’ But what they can do is try to pick apart the argument.” Meanwhile, inside Russia, clearly fearing an exodus of the country’s wealthy multinationals who have secured European passports through residency, Putin has signed a decree to block anyone from leaving the country with more than $10,000 in foreign currency to “ensure Russia’s financial stability,” according to the Kremlin. Oleksiy Arestovich, a top aide to Zelensky, noted Wednesday that Russian soldiers were getting increasingly younger. “The Russian Army is running out of resources,” he told the UNIAN news agency. “They are sending cadets from military academies to war, a troop of second-year cadets of a military school has surrendered to us.” If confirmed, it would help explain why Russia’s much-feared military is not able to move faster. On Wednesday morning, Russia announced its delegation “would be in place” for new talks with Ukraine negotiators later in the day, though no location was announced. Tass news agency later confirmed that an aide to Zelensky said the Ukrainian delegation would be at the table for a second try to reach a peace accord to stop the deadly conflict.

3/3/2022,"By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Human rights groups and Ukraine's ambassador to the United States on Monday accused Russia of attacking Ukrainians with cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, weapons that have been condemned by a variety of international organizations. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both said that Russian forces appeared to have used widely banned cluster munitions, with Amnesty accusing them of attacking a preschool in northeastern Ukraine while civilians took shelter inside. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, told reporters after meeting with members of the U.S. Congress that Russia had used a thermobaric weapon, known as a vacuum bomb, in its invasion of her country. ""They used the vacuum bomb today,"" Markarova said after a meeting with lawmakers. ""...The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large."" A vacuum bomb, or thermobaric weapon, sucks in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, typically producing a blast wave of a significantly longer duration than that of a conventional explosive and is capable of vaporizing human bodies. There has been no official confirmation that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine. CNN reported that one of its teams had spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rocket launcher near the Ukrainian border early on Saturday afternoon. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she had seen reports but did not have confirmation that Russia had used such weapons. ""If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime,"" she told a press briefing, noting that there are international organizations that would assess that and President Joe Biden's administration ""would look to be a part of that conversation."" The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Markarova said Ukraine was working actively with the Biden administration and Congress to obtain more weapons and tougher sanctions. ""They should pay, they should pay a heavy price,"" she told reporters after leaving the meeting. One lawmaker who attended the meeting, Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, said the Ukrainians had asked for a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine but that he felt that was too dangerous because it could provoke conflict with Russia. Amnesty International said international humanitarian law prohibits the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons such as cluster munitions. Launching indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians constitutes a war crime.

3/3/2022,"It's common for slightly cynical pundits to remark that no one remembers a State of the Union speech 48 hours after it ends. In the case of the State of the Union President Joe Biden delivered Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress, I suspect the afterglow will last barely more than 24. The 2022 State of the Union was a mediocre speech poorly delivered. To say so isn't entirely fair: The elderly Biden's halting manner of speaking, marked by malapropisms and smudged syllables, hasn't been the kind of political liability professional word-slingers like myself always presume it to be. Yet last night was filled with even more flubs than usual, with the lowlight coming early on when the president predicted (no doubt accurately) that Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine would ensure the Russian president never wins ""the hearts and souls of the Iranian people."" It's also somewhat churlish to criticize any State of the Union for rhetorical mediocrity. The annual address has long been little more than a laundry list of legislative priorities tied together with bromides and pedestrian civic flattery. (Is the state of the American union ever anything other than ""strong"" or some slight variation of it?) Still, last night's speech was unusual for opening with an extended section about Russia's invasion of Ukraine that could have — and probably should have — stood alone as a primetime Oval Office address to the nation. Instead, the administration opted to combine something resembling George W. Bush's gravely resolute speech to Congress on September 20, 2001, with a standard-issue State of the Union. The result was a substantive mishmash that at once pulled down the foreign policy message and made the litany of domestic policies that followed sound even more trivial than usual. That Biden repeatedly resorted to ""folks"" to accomplish transitions throughout the latter half of the speech only added to its disjointedness. Probably the most politically significant part of the speech came in the middle, when Biden explicitly rejected the activist-driven imperative to ""defund the police."" That was the president's depersonalized Sister Souljah moment, and it was smart. Not only is crime surging around the country, but the slogan is extremely unpopular, with polls showing Black and Hispanic Democrats more likely than white members of the party to favor increasing funding for police. Equally important, though less potent, was Biden's response to inflation, the issue that has risen to the top of voter concerns in recent months. On the plus side, the president at least used the term and acknowledged its reality. Up until now, he's been hesitant to discuss it. That's understandable, given inflation's political toxicity, how little any president can do to fight it, and how painful and slow any serious effort to combat it can be. Yet Biden and his advisers apparently decided the president needed to sound like he would slay the beast of rising prices by … defending economic nationalism. Most economists would call that a non sequitur and perhaps even an outright contradiction. (Won't pulling out of international supply chains and discouraging international trade tend to drive prices even higher?) Yet calls to ""buy American"" poll well, so the administration is apparently gambling that inflation will take care of itself as the COVID-19 pandemic finally recedes, and in the meantime, the nationalist message just might do the trick of insulating the president from popular anger. As for the rest of the speech, it largely consisted of bones thrown to various factions in the Democratic Party. Most of them will go nowhere, given the narrow divides in Congress and the dysfunctional legislative dynamics of a midterm-election year. Such box-checking was no doubt politically necessary, especially given Biden's low approval ratings, but it's an intra-Democratic imperative that likely lulled the rest of the country to sleep. Will Biden see a bounce in his approval coming out of the speech? Maybe. Just don't expect it to last much longer than a day.

3/3/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Several dozen Japanese men have answered a Ukrainian call for foreign volunteers to fight Russia's invasion, according to a media report on Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Sunday for the formation of an ""international legion,"" prompting dozens from the United States and Canada to volunteer. As of Tuesday, 70 Japanese men - including 50 former members of Japan's Self-Defense Forces and two veterans of the French Foreign Legion - had applied to be volunteers, the Mainichi Shimbun daily said, quoting a Tokyo company handling the volunteers. A Ukrainian Embassy spokesperson acknowledged receiving calls from people ""wanting to fight for Ukraine,"" but said they knew nothing further about volunteers. A Feb 28 social media post from the embassy said it thanked Japanese for their many inquiries about volunteering but added a proviso. ""Any candidates for this must have experience in Japan's Self-Defence Forces or have undergone specialised training,"" it said. In a new post on Twitter on Wednesday, the Ukranian embassy in Japan said it were looking for volunteers with medical, IT, communication, or firefighting experience. It was not immediately clear if the volunteer positions were remote or involved travelling to the country. Japan has told its nationals to put off travel to Ukraine for any reason, a warning reiterated on Wednesday by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, who said he was aware of the reports about the volunteers. ""The Japanese foreign ministry has issued an evacuation advisory for all of Ukraine and we want people to stop all travel to Ukraine, regardless of the purpose of their visit,"" he told a news conference. ""We are communicating with the Ukrainian embassy in Japan and pointed out that an evacuation advisory is in place.""

3/3/2022,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — A 46-year-old woman has been arrested on animal cruelty charges after throwing a 3-year-old pug named Bucky off of a seventh-floor balcony Clearwater condominium during an argument with her ex-boyfriend, authorities said. Eric Adeson told Clearwater police investigators the woman, who he had dated for several months, also threw his keys and cellphone over the balcony Sunday. The dog was found dead on the pavement below, police said. Adeson's attorney, Katherine Neal, filed a civil complaint against the woman Monday, seeking $30,000 in damages. The complaint said the couple had ended their relationship in February, but she had arrived at Adeson's condo Sunday smelling of alcohol and being verbally aggressive toward him. He asked her to leave, but she refused and instead picked up the dog and threw it over the balcony. Adeson told the Tampa Bay Times he adopted Bucky as a puppy when his 10-year-old dog named Sandy was undergoing cancer treatments. He said the two had been playmates ever since. “He (Bucky) just actually had his third birthday,” Adeson said. “I never thought that Sandy would outlive Bucky.” The woman, who was arrested Monday, also faces criminal mischief and domestic battery charges, according to Pinellas County jail records. Neal said the civil complaint was filed to send a message to the woman and others that “acts of cruelty against animals are utterly outrageous, indecent, and completely unacceptable in our society.""",U.S./Associated Press,Ex-girlfriend tosses man's dog off condo balcony in Florida,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-girlfriend-tosses-mans-dog-152237486.html
3/3/2022,"NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel came under fire Monday after posting a tweet that seemed to lament that the U.S. had not yet attacked Russia for invading Ukraine. Engel noted Monday that a massive Russian convoy was in a position to be destroyed by the U.S. or NATO and said that direct involvement against Russia would risk “everything,” meaning a nuclear war. However, in the next sentence, he said, “Does the West watch in silence as it rolls?” But as Reason.com noted, “the U.S. cannot attack Russia because Congress has yet to declare war on the country. And make no mistake, a direct attack on Russian forces by either the U.S. or NATO would be an act of war” and dramatically increase the risk of nuclear warfare. Many Twitter users were shocked that Engel seemed almost eager to get his war on and also tried to remind him: Be careful what you wish for. Some people offered advice to Engel in hopes he’d rethink the point he was making in his tweet. i dunno if i was a chief foreign correspondent i would not glibly wonder why one nuclear power isn't carpet bombing another nuclear power's forces https://t.co/O1dkxPUfDw — Edward Ongweso Jr (@bigblackjacobin) February 28, 2022 if you want a war so badly, go enlist https://t.co/1Q6uJ3GSHV — Sarah Jones (@onesarahjones) February 28, 2022 Pro tip: do not tweet questions like this until you've given at least, oh, I don't know, a whole thirty seconds of thought to steps two, three, and four of your decision tree. https://t.co/HLnfV7p2wd — Daniel W.

3/3/2022,"By Jason Hovet and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk PRAGUE/WARSAW (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's comments that Moscow's nuclear deterrent is on high alert have unleashed a wave of anxiety in Central Europe, with people rushing to buy iodine which they believe may protect them from radiation. From Poland to Bulgaria, people living in the former Soviet-era satellite states have also jammed passport offices, topped up their fuel tanks and prepared to leave at a moment's notice. Others enquired about joining the military. ""In the past six days Bulgarian pharmacies have sold as much [iodine] as they sell for a year,"" said Nikolay Kostov, chair of the Pharmacies Union. ""Some pharmacies are already out of stock. We have ordered new quantities but I am afraid they will not last very long."" ""It's been a bit mad,"" said Miroslava Stenkova, a representative of Dr. Max pharmacies in the Czech Republic, where some stores had run out of iodine after demand soared. Iodine - taken as pills or syrup - is considered a way of protecting the body against conditions such as thyroid cancer in case of radioactive exposure. In 2011, Japanese authorities recommended that people around the site of the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant take iodine. Officials in the region have recognised the demand but cautioned iodine is not necessary in the current situation and would not help in case of nuclear war. Dana Drabova, head of the Czech State office for Nuclear Safety, wrote on Twitter: ""You ask a lot about iodine tablets... as radiation protection when (God forbid) nuclear weapons are used, they are basically useless."" News last week that Russian forces had gained control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant where an accident in 1986 contaminated a huge swathe of Ukraine and sent a radioactive cloud across Europe, unnerved people in a region where many remember being given iodine in the aftermath of that disaster. Radiation levels at Chernobyl have increased but are still low enough not to pose a hazard to the public despite the movement of Russia's military vehicles there, the U.N. nuclear watchdog IAEA said on Wednesday. In Poland, the number of pharmacies selling iodine more than doubled, according to gdziepolek.pl, a Polish website that helps patients find the nearest pharmacy with a drug they are seeking. ""Internal data on our website shows that interest in iodine increased around 50 times since last Thursday,"" said Bartlomiej Owczarek, the website's co-founder. RUSH TO RENEW PASSPORTS Since the start of the fighting last Thursday, hundreds of thousands of refugees have crossed into the European Union, mainly entering through borders in Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to flee what Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and capture ""neo-Nazis"" he falsely says are running the country of 44 million people. Last Sunday Putin ordered his military command to put Russia's deterrence forces - which include nuclear arms - on high alert, citing what he called aggressive statements by NATO leaders and Western economic sanctions against Moscow. Washington and its NATO allies have rejected Ukraine's request to impose a no-fly zone over the country, arguing this would lead to direct confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. Against this backdrop, some central Europeans have prepared to leave, clogging passport offices to ensure they had valid travel documents. Slovakia's interior minister called on citizens not to flood police with applications while long lines formed outside some passport offices in Warsaw. ""I have a son who lives outside the EU and I am supposed to go visit him and I was afraid that later I would not be able to get a passport,"" said Maria, a pensioner standing in line who declined to give her full name. ""All these people are not standing in this line on a whim, but because they want a safety net."" In the Czech Republic - where Russian soldiers helped Communists crush the 1968 Prague Spring protests for reforms - authorities scrapped a regular monthly testing of emergency sirens on Wednesday to avoid alarming people. Some young central Europeans considered joining the military. Poland's defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak said more than 2,200 have declared their interest in joining the Polish Armed Forces, more than five times the number the previous week. At a recruiting station in Prague, an officer said interest had jumped and one student said he was there due to Ukraine. ""The situation in Ukraine only convinced me it is probably the best decision I can take for my country,"" said Marek Jetmar, a 27-year-old psychology student.
