3/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) — Russia’s decision to block foreign owners from seizing hundreds of planes worth about $10 billion is roiling a market where aircraft leases are bundled into bonds and sold to investors.

But only a handful have been extracted, and hopes for more are dim. And so some asset-backed securities in the aviation space are coming under duress as a result. Although these types of transactions are designed to survive cash flow problems at the airlines leasing the planes, fully losing access to planes under these circumstances almost guarantees that lease payments that feed these ABS deals will soon dry up, with recourse uncertain. “It will be interesting to watch, as potentially the bottom capital structure could start to see losses,” said Jennifer Thomas, portfolio manager at Loomis, Sayles & Co. The situation has already had a chilling effect on over two dozen aircraft ABS deals that are exposed to the region, with investors fearing some tranches within those deals might take losses. Among the ones most exposed are two from Carlyle Aviation — one with 44% and another with 37% of lease payments tied to Russia or Ukraine — and two others from Castlelake Aviation. Kroll Bond Ratings is evaluating whether to downgrade nine deals, worth roughly $2.9 billion in total, including the Carlyle and Castlelake ones. Moody’s Investors Service has done the same to one Castlelake ABS. According to a March 7 note from the credit rater, the deal will see reduced cash flow due to “foregone lease income tied to early lease terminations and increased transaction costs stemming from potentially prolonged repossession and remarketing timelines associated with the aircraft on lease to Russian airlines.” Read more: Nine Aircraft ABS on Watch Due to Russia’s War in Ukraine: KBRA Some deals have already moved frantically in the secondary market. A refinancing of a Castlelake aircraft-lease asset-backed bond originally issued in 2017 plunged in value in early March after the Russian invasion, losing 17 cents on the dollar in a single day, according to Empirasign. The bond, known as CLAST 2017-1R, tranche B, was marked as high as 99.8 cents on Dec. 31 and plummeted to about 82 cents on March 1, Empirasign said. It’s currently at 83.25 cents. The ABS has about a 20% exposure to Russia, according to S&P.

By Feb. 26, EU-based insurers and reinsurers were required to stop providing coverage of planes to Russia-based airlines, while in Ukraine, some insurers have already withdrawn their coverage for aircraft leased and located in the country despite a lack of sanctions. Although lessors have their own insurance policies, insurers may find a way to not pay them back, Moody’s said. “Insurers may take steps to unilaterally cancel some policies, subject to required notice periods, before lessors incur losses, which could limit lessors’ recoveries and add to potential future loss in the transactions.” Elsewhere in credit markets: Americas At least five of the eight companies looking to issue new U.S. investment-grade debt opted to stand down Tuesday ahead of the U.S. decision to ban Russian energy imports.

3/10/2022,"By Shariq Khan BENGALURU (Reuters) -Oil prices plunged as much as 17% after media reports said OPEC producers United Arab Emirates and Iraq said they would support increased production, potentially offsetting some of the supply disruptions caused by sanctions on Russian oil after its invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude fell more than 17%, or $22, to hit a session low at $105.60 during a sharp selloff. The benchmark crude recovered some losses by 1:03 p.m. EST (1803 GMT) to trade down $13.29, or 10.4%, at $114.69 a barrel. U.S. crude was down $12.01, or 9.7%, at $111.69. Prices hit session lows after traders cited media reports of an Iraqi minister claiming the country is ready to hike production if OPEC+ requires it to. Reuters could not immediately verify the accuracy of the report. Financial Times had earlier reported that Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE's ambassador to Washington, said the country favours increasing production. ""That's not nothing. They can probably bring about 800,000 barrels to the market very quickly, even immediately, bringing us one-seventh of the way there in replacing Russian supply,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.

3/10/2022,"The global economy is set to experience uncertainty, sky-high energy prices, and slowing growth as tough Russia sanctions put pressure on markets over the coming months, according to the global research team at Bank of America. In a Tuesday note to clients, the bank’s analysts warned that “there is no clear off-ramp for Russia” in the Ukraine conflict, and admitted that trying to pin down an exact economic forecast following Russia’s invasion has been like “catching a falling knife.” ""Expert opinion has been repeatedly wrong about the course of events. If we believe the experts, Putin would have never invaded, Ukraine would have offered weak resistance and sanctions would be limited,"" the analysts wrote. The team at BofA lowered their 2022 gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts for the U.S. from 3.6% to 3.3% over the past week, and they now see Euro Area GDP growth falling to just 2.8% this year, compared to 3.5% in previous estimates. The analysts also bumped their 2022 inflation expectations for the U.S. and Euro Area to 7% and 6%, respectively. However, strong savings rates, low unemployment, and energy independence will help the U.S. economy weather the storm better than most, the analysts predict. Still, they believe Americans should expect lower growth and higher inflation than was previously anticipated in a rough year ahead. The effect that Russian oil, or lack thereof, has on the global market should not be underestimated. Oil’s recent price jump to over $130 per barrel after the Ukraine invasion has shocked many market pundits and experts, including Bank of America. The bank’s global research team said they now see a scenario where Brent crude oil prices, the international benchmark, could rise to $175 per barrel by the second quarter. That means more pressure at the pump for average consumers around the world. Although previous U.S. and European sanctions against Russia were careful to leave oil untouched, that all changed today when President Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports to the U.S. The president said the ban was part of actions meant “to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.” In a recent Quinnipiac University national poll, 71% of Americans said that they would support the move, even if it meant higher gasoline prices. In response to the ban, regular gas prices jumped to $4.17 in the U.S., a roughly 10 cent jump from Monday. Gas prices are now $1.39 higher than they were just a year ago, according to data from the American Automobile Association. The European Union also revealed on Tuesday that it would cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds this year, even as Dutch TTF gas futures jumped as much as 25% on Monday, showing Europe’s resolve to stand by their sanctions. Unlike the U.S., which imports just 3.2% of its gas from Russia, Europe bought around 150 billion cubic meters of Russian gas last year—representing about one-third of its needs, according to B of A.The tough sanctions from both US and Europe will lead to higher oil and gas prices and have darkened the inflation outlook, according to Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi, who said in a Tweet on Tuesday that expectations for price increases are threatening “to become unhinged.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",World/Fortune•yesterday,"BofA says ‘There is no clear off-ramp’ for Russia and ‘it’s like catching a falling knife,’ issues dire prediction for global economy",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bofa-says-no-clear-off-174726740.html

3/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude futures sank as the United Arab Emirates called on OPEC+ to boost oil output faster while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reiterated willingness to consider some compromises to end the war with Russia. Most Read from Bloomberg China Warns U.S. Over Forming Pacific NATO, Backing Taiwan Owners Fear Planes ‘Are Gone Forever’ After Russia Shields Them From Seizure China Pushes Conspiracy Theory About U.S. Labs in Ukraine Ukraine Open to Neutrality, Won’t Yield Territory, Aide Says Ukraine Update: Firms Exit Russia, Fitch Sees ‘Imminent’ Default Brent dropped more than 17%, falling to nearly $105 a barrel, after a confluence of headlines sparked a risk-off sentiment throughout markets. The UAE said it will call on its fellow OPEC+ members to boost oil output faster. At the same time, Zelenskiy reiterated to Germany’s Bild newspaper it was ready to make compromises to end the war. “The market has not lost an overwhelming amount of oil just yet, its pricing a risk premium that the amount of oil lost is going to be significant and force demand destruction,” said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at ICAP North America Inc. “As long as diplomacy wins out in the next few weeks, I think its safe to say prices should come down more. Similarly, Iraqi Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael said from an oil conference in Houston that the country hasn’t seen extra demand from oil customers. There’s no need for OPEC+ to ramp up production more than planned, and additional hikes could harm the market, he added. Russia is a major supplier of refined products to Europe and the threat of fuel supplies drying up in the region has sent diesel markets into a frenzy. U.S. distillates inventories fell to the lowest level since November 2014, dropping 5.23 million barrels, according to government data. Volatility for WTI futures dropped more than six percentage points, the biggest decline since early December, potentially signaling some reduced geopolitical risk in the market. The U.S. and U.K. decided Tuesday to halt Russian oil imports after Shell Plc and BP Plc said they are stopping new purchases, but other European nations have been reluctant to commit to similar action. The International Energy Agency said a recently announced stockpile release will amount to almost 63 million barrels of crude and products, but it has done little to cool prices. Against the market’s fast-moving backdrop, OPEC+ is sitting on the sidelines sticking to its 400,000 barrel-a-day production increase. Russia is one of the key leaders of the cartel, along with Saudi Arabia and a major producer of crude and petroleum products such as diesel. Double Trouble at U.S. Pump as Diesel Peaks With Gasoline: Chart Oil imports from Russia made up about 3% of all the crude shipments that arrived in the U.S. last year. When other petroleum products are included, such as unfinished fuel oil, Russia accounted for about 8% of oil imports. A planned House vote on the legislation to ban imports was delayed, even as Biden moved ahead with executive action amid growing political pressure to do so. “The market is awaiting the domino effect of mainland Europe announcing a ban, however, with oil majors announcing that they won’t touch Russian oil, there is already a de-facto ban,”said Keshav Lohiya, founder of consultant Oilytics. Shell and BP said they won’t make any new purchases of Russian oil and gas, but they can’t immediately disentangle themselves from the country in part due to long-term contracts. It’s a dramatic U-turn for Shell, which faced heavy criticism for its purchase of Russian crude last week, and could have a huge impact on the region’s oil refining.

3/10/2022,"Remember the movie ‘The Perfect Storm’? Three weather fronts collided off the coast of New England, and George Clooney’s poor fishing boat never stood a chance. Hopefully, today’s economies will do better against the headwinds that are rapidly spinning into a perfect political-economic storm. The storm got started as 2022 opened up. The bull run we had last year came to sudden halt, markets started turning down, and by the end of January the NASDAQ was in correction territory with the S&P not far behind. Supply chain shocks and stubbornly high inflation were cast as the villains. Pundits started talking about the stagflation of the Carter years. Things failed to improve in February, as markets just couldn’t gain traction, and at the end of that month Russia invaded Ukraine, adding geopolitical tension, military conflict, and a looming wheat shortage to the mix. Now the specter of stagflation is closing in, a wicked combination of high inflation and low to no GDP growth. Ripple effects from Western financial sanctions on Russia are putting added pressure on global economies. Watching from Morgan Stanley, equity strategist Michael Wilson acknowledges the problem head-on, writing, “Downside risk remains most acute over the next 6-8 weeks. We are firmly in the grasp of a bear market that is incomplete in both time and price.” In this situation, investors will naturally gravitate toward defensive stocks – and that will quickly draw attention to the high-yield dividend payers. Dividend stocks offer a degree of safety by paying out an income stream whether markets move up or down, and that will help to insulate investors when the main indexes turn south. With this in mind, we used the TipRanks' database to pinpoint three stocks that meet a profile: a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street’s analysts and a dividend yield of 5% or better -- more than double the average dividend yield found among S&P-listed companies. Let’s take a closer look now. Alpine Income Property Trust (PINE) We’ll start with a commercial real estate investment trust (REIT), Alpine Income Property. Based at Daytona Beach, Florida, Alpine has a wide-ranging portfolio of properties, spread across most regions of the lower 48 states – the exception is the Rocky Mountain region. The company’s operations are focused on Texas, where it has 23 properties, with the 11 properties in Ohio coming in second. Overall, Alpine boasts 113 properties totaling 3.3 million square feet – and best yet, a 100% occupancy rate. The company has seen its revenues rise steadily over the past couple years, regardless of the pandemic, and the 4Q21 result, $9.47 million, was up 75% year-over-year. Diluted EPS in the quarter, at 64 cents, was orders magnitude higher than the 2 cents reported in 4Q20 – and simply blew away the 2-cent EPS forecast. These strong quarterly results gave Alpine confidence to keep up its dividend. The payment, declared for 27 cents per common share, is payable at the end of this month. Annualizing to $1.04, it gives a strong yield of 5.6%. Of importance to dividend investors, the company has raised the dividend payment 5 times in just the last two years. This commercial REIT is covered by BTIG analyst Michael Gorman, who wrote of it recently: “As a small-cap REIT early on in its growth cycle, Alpine has demonstrated its ability to generate value from smaller, one-off deals that are more insulated from private capital. Alpine grew FFO/sh 30% last year, and, despite the dilution from Office dispositions in 1H22, we expect the portfolio should again generate meaningful adjusted growth for shareholders this year."" ""While rising rates generally have an outsized impact on the net lease REIT sector's ability to grow, we expect investors could turn to well-levered value names such as PINE, which currently trades at a 21% relative discount despite outperforming the peer group by 2100 bps last year,"" the analyst added. To this end, Gorman rates PINE stock a Buy, while his $23 price target implies a 12-month upside potential of ~23%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~28% potential total return profile. (to watch Gorman’s track record, click here) Wall Street, generally, likes this stock, as shown by the 4 to 1 breakdown of Buy versus Hold ratings, backing the Strong Buy consensus view. The stock is trading for $18.88 and its $22.20 average target indicates room for ~18% gain from that level in the year ahead. (See PINE stock analysis on TipRanks) Global Medical REIT (GMRE) The next stock we’re looking at, another REIT, specializes in medical properties and facilities. Global Medical has a portfolio comprising 167 buildings, with 298 leases. The bulk of the company’s operations are in the Midwest and Southeast regions, with 50 and 51 properties respectively. The total portfolio boasts over 4.3 million square feet of leasable space. In the last quarter of 2021, Global Medical brought in 6 cents per share in total earnings. While below the 7-cent forecast, this result was still triple the 2-cents from 4Q20. At the top line, revenue grew 21% year-over-year to reach $30.3 million. For the full year 2021, Global Medical made an important shift from net loss (of 17 cents per share in 2020) to a 19-cent EPS profit. The company has an 8-year history of keeping reliable dividends, and that has kept its payment steady at 20 cents per common share in the last two years, despite the pandemic crisis. The last declaration was in December, and paid out in January. The annualized payment of 80 cents per common share gives GMRE a solid dividend yield of 5.3%. Covering the stock for Colliers Securities, 5-star analyst Barry Oxford sees GMRE as a company in a sound position to keep bringing returns to shareholders. ""The company continues its strategy of investing in off-campus, purpose-built, medical facilities such as MOBs, specialty hospitals, IRFs and ASCs, that are geographically situated to take advantage of the aging U.S. population and the decentralization of healthcare. We believe their portfolio should continue to perform well in the short to medium term,"" Oxford explained. Furthermore, Oxford sees the current valuation as an attractive entry point, writing: ""The company has less than average multiple in the healthcare sector 15.3x versus 17.9x for the group. Given the company's conservative balance sheet, above average growth and excellent assets, we believe a premium multiple is warranted."" All of this prompted Oxford to maintain a Buy rating on GMRE, along with a $19 price target. This target conveys his confidence in GMRE's ability to climb 25% higher in the next year. (To watch Oxford’s track record, click here) Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating on Global Medical is based on 6 recent reviews, that include 5 Buys over 1 Hold. The shares have an average price target of $18.30, implying an upside of ~22% from the current $15.08 share price. (See GMRE stock analysis on TipRanks) Medical Properties Trust (MPW) We’ll wrap up with another healthcare-focused REIT. Medical Properties has a $22 billion portfolio, with operations in 9 countries, and a total of 438 facilities with approximately 46,000 total beds. The largest part of the portfolio, some 72%, is general acute care hospitals. Behavioral health facilities make up 11% of the total, and inpatient rehab hospitals account for 9% of the company’s holdings. Medical Properties has seen its top line grow steadily in the past two years, with 8 consecutive sequential quarterly revenue gains. The most recent reported quarter, 4Q21, showed $409.3 million at the top line, up 22% year-over-year. At the bottom line, the company had an EPS of 34 cents, a 70% y/y increase. Long-term gains of this sort have allowed the company to fund a solid dividend, and Medical Properties boasts 9 consecutive years of dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend payment 4 times in the past two years along, with the most recent increase coming with the last declaration, in February. That declaration, for 29 cents per share, was up 1 cent from the previous 4 quarters, and with an annualized rate of $1.16, yields 5.7%. Looking at Medical Properties for Berenberg, analyst Connor Siversky is optimistic of the company’s prospects, writing: “While we believe the spiking cost of hospital labor at the end of 2021 will negatively affect coverage in the short term, it is our view that procedure costs will adjust quickly, negating a black sky scenario for a typical hospital operator. As such, we believe MPW presently represents a stable option for healthcare REIT investors in the short term. Relatively speaking, we find more visibility in the short-run financial condition of MPW versus peers in need of occupancy gains and margin expansion opportunities.” Accordingly, Siversky gives MPW a Buy rating alongside a $25 price target. The analyst, therefore, expects the stock to climb ~24% over the next 12 months. (To watch Siversky’s track record, click here) All in all, the 8 recent ratings on this stock add up to a Strong Buy consensus, with 6 positives outweighing the 2 Holds. Shares are trading for $20.13 and have an average target of $25.13, suggesting ~25% one-year upside potential.

3/10/2022,"By Kevin Buckland, Medha Singh and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss (Reuters) - Bitcoin soared on Wednesday after President Joe Biden signed an executive order that requires U.S. government agencies to assess the benefits and risks of creating a central bank digital dollar and other cryptocurrency issues. The executive order potentially expands the adoption of virtual currencies in the U.S. financial system. Biden's order will require the Treasury Department, the Commerce Department and other key agencies to prepare reports on ""the future of money"" and the role cryptocurrencies will play. ""With the recent sanctions regime in place as a result of the war in Ukraine, it is doubly imperative that we have a regulatory framework in place for digital assets that counters illicit finance, and prevent risks to financial stability and national security,"" said Michael Pierson, managing partner at law firm FisherBroyles. The White House last year said it was considering wide-ranging oversight of the cryptocurrency market - including an executive order - to deal with the growing threat of ransomware and other cyber crime. In midday trading, bitcoin rose 9.1% to $42,280, on track for its largest percentage gain since Feb. 28, while smaller peer ether, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, added 6.3% to $2,740, also set for its best day this month. ""At 21Shares, we've always believed that the best way to introduce and expose investors to crypto is through a safe and regulated approach,"" said Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer and co-founder of 21Shares, the world's largest provider of crypto exchange traded products. ""Today's action will help the U.S. establish itself as a leader in crypto for years to come."" U.S. exchange traded funds (ETFs) tracking bitcoin futures that gained regulatory approval late last year also jumped. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF surged 9.8% and 10.2%, respectively, in early trading. U.S. crypto miners that act as a proxy for moves in digital coins also advanced. Riot Blockchain soared 11.9% and Marathon Digital Holdings surged 14.6%, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc added 9.4%.

3/10/2022,"What do you get when you combine: a fading stock market, frozen central bank assets (including oligarchs), widespread credit downgrades, getting kicked off SWIFT, potential cyberattacks, spiking inflation, evaporating fiscal and monetary stimulus, and Fed interest rate hikes? In my opinion, the perfect recipe for collapse. DOW DAILY CHART: Stocks may be entering the sharp breakdown I’ve been forecasting. Strong downside follow-through that finishes below the February low (32,300) would confirm a repeat of the 2018 taper-tantrum and project a decline to 29,700 by March 25 (+/- a trading day). If selling accelerates faster than anticipated (very possible), then a trip to fill the open price gap at 28,500 becomes likely.
