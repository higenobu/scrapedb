1/22/2022,"Although the market is yet to close, it is safe to say that January 21 did turn into the ‘Black Friday’ of the month. With the overall market losses running up to $137 billion in the last 24 hours, here are the possible reasons as to why it could have happened. The market witnessed one of the highest ever single-day liquidations today as, since the opening of the market to the time of this report, almost $880 million worth of liquidations had been recorded. Leading this was Bitcoin which registered close to $175 million liquidated contracts. This is one of the biggest driving factors when it comes to a market crash. In the past too on every major liquidation, Bitcoin created a huge red candle creating a cascading effect on the rest of the market (ref. Bitcoin Price Action image). Today one of the biggest economies in the world proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies on Russian territory. According to them, cryptocurrency acted as a threat to financial stability, and reasons pertaining to citizens’ wellbeing and its monetary policy sovereignty drove the ban. This was one of the biggest blows to the global crypto market after China’s ban since Russia is the world’s third-largest Bitcoin miner which also raised environmental concern. The bank explicitly stated: “The best solution is to introduce a ban on cryptocurrency mining in Russia” USA’s stock market has had a significant impact on the crypto market in the past and for the same reason, it won’t be surprising if that would be the case today as well. The S&P 500 Index over the course of 72 hours has lost almost 4%. Plus since Bitcoin and the SPX share a correlation as high as 0.59, the dips were bound to affect one another and so possibly it did. At the time of this report pretty much all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies have within the 10% with Bitcoin losing almost 7.83%. Not only did it lose its support of $40.5k, but it also tested the critical level of $38k. Fortunately, BTC managed to keep above it trading at $38,310 at press time and as long as it maintains movement in that zone, the market will be safe. Ethereum on the other hand did although did not lose its critical support of $2727, it was trading right at it at the time of this report at $2789, losing over 11% throughout the day. Lastly, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange’s token Binance Coin (BNB) too lost close to 11.32% but it was, fortunately, trading far away at $418, far away from its critical support of $399.

1/22/2022,"A Miami couple was arrested Friday after an investigation found they stole $2.5 million from a Florida Keys fish house they managed and from several commercial fishermen, the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office said. Marianela Armenteros, 44, and Yamir Gonzalez-Betancourt, 53, were booked into a Miami-Dade detention center. They are accused of spending several months running scams to cash in on other people’s work on Stock Island. Armenteros was charged with multiple counts of felony grand theft and Gonzalez-Betancourt was charged with one count of felony grand theft. The pair had worked for a fish house in the 6000 block of Peninsular Avenue owned by the Valero-Duran Corp. — Armenteros worked as general manager while Betancourt was the assistant general manager — said sheriff’s office spokesman Adam Linhardt. Armenteros put thousands of stone crab and lobster tags in her name instead of the names of the commercial fishermen, preventing the fishermen from fishing legally and profiting from their work, Linhardt said. Armenteros also placed a commercial fisherman’s boat in her name without his permission, and the fish house lost money due to the fishermen being unable to sell their products to the company, Linhardt said. Meanwhile, Gonzalez-Betancourt ripped off the fish house by selling lobsters directly to export buyers for cash instead of the fish house, costing the business more than $100,000, investigators said. In early 2021, the owner of the fish house and three commercial fishermen contacted the sheriff’s office and said the two were stealing money. On Friday, Armenteros was being held on $400,000 bond while Gonzalez-Betancourt was being held on $100,000 bond, Linhardt said. It was unclear whether they had legal representation. They are expected to be brought to Monroe County to face prosecution, Linhardt said. Rafael Garcia is listed as the president of the Valero-Duran Corp., 6011 Peninsular Ave., in online reports on the Florida Department of State’s Division of Corporations’ website. Garcia’s address is in Miami, the reports state. The business is also listed as Key West Fisheries in state records. Garcia could not be reached for comment Friday. Phone calls to the business number in the records went unanswered.",U.S./Miami Herald,A Miami couple ran a Keys fish house.

1/22/2022,"What’s it like to be young, female and Prime Minister? “It’s a tough job. It's something you cannot prepare for.” Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin made headlines in 2019 when – at 34 years old – she became world’s youngest-serving head of government. At the time all five party leaders in her center-left coalition government were female. “I think it's very important that we have people from many genders, many generations, many backgrounds in powerful positions making decisions together. I think it's the only way to make sure that the decisions are good ones."" So who is she? Marin had a swift rise in Finnish politics becoming head of the city council of her industrial hometown of Tampere at the age of 27. She said there is no trick to her success - just hard work. With 540,000 followers on Instagram Marin says she wants to bring a human side to high-level politics to show other young people age is not a factor. But her high-profile role as a young and female leader has made her a target for hate speech. ""…… the hate speech that we are facing are often sexualized, it actually focuses on that you are a woman, so of course it matters and we can see that about the speech that we are facing on the social media on the internet. But as I said, I try to ignore it and not to affect me and my decisions. But I worry about so many others and this is why we have to make sure that we are not tolerating this kind of behavior."" A report by the NATO Strategic Communications Centre last year found that female Finnish politicians are subject to gendered abuse on Twitter, much of which came from clusters of right-wing accounts and did not seem highly coordinated. Some opponents have attacked her for appearing on fashion magazine covers and for being spotted out with celebrities in Helsinki. ‘’Well, I try to ignore it. I don't focus on the hate speech myself, but as a country I think it's very important that we will fight together against hate speech, that we make sure that everyone has the possibility to make a difference, to influence the society and to participate in the decision-making processes. To take her mind off work, Marin says she enjoys running, walking...and cleaning. “I think all physical things we can do also helps the stress and it actually relaxes our mind, so at least for me it's really important that I have the possibilities to step away from the work and do something totally different.""",Politics/Reuters Videos,"What’s it like to be young, female and Prime Minister?",https://news.yahoo.com/young-female-prime-minister-165806637.html
1/22/2022,"A shooting at a ritzy resort near Cancun left two Canadians dead and one other injured Friday, Mexican authorities said. The gunman remains at large. The shooting is the latest in a spate of horrific violence in the vacation hotspot. A man wielding a gun was caught on CCTV at the five-star Xcaret Hotel, located at popular Playa del Carmen, in a gray sweatsuit by the pool. Lucio Hernández Gutiérrez, the Public Secretary of Defense for the state of Quintana Roo, said gunfire broke out after a group of Canadian guests got into an argument. The guests and the gunman have not been identified. After authorities swarmed the compound, the three victims were transported to the hospital. One died in the ambulance, the other in the hospital, according to Quintana Roo prosecutor Óscar Montes de Oca. Hernández Gutiérrez called for any information available on the shooter, who has not been captured. The shooting appears to have taken place in a poolside dining area, according to graphic video apparently posted from the scene. “He’s still breathing, he’s still breathing!” two women with North American accents can be heard saying in the background. Three people can be seen lying on the ground among overturned chairs and guests in their swimming trunks. Guests recorded eerie videos of the deserted resort around the time of the shooting. In one, a band could be heard still playing a drumbeat in the distance. A string of violent attacks have plagued Cancun tourist destinations in recent months. In early November, four American tourists were injured in a cartel shooting at a Cancun resort. The next month, gunmen on jet-skis sent Cancun beachgoers fleeing for their lives after opening fire. Around the same time, an American tourist was found “beaten to a bloody pulp” in her hotel room. Este es el huésped que disparó ocasionando las lesiones que posteriormente provocaran la muerte a uno de ellos, las autoridades del grupo de coordinacion despliegan fuerte operativo para su captura, cualquier información para pronta detención estaremos profundamente agradecidos. pic.twitter.com/PRDC0hhBBe — Lucio Hernández Gutiérrez (@Lucio_HG) January 21, 2022 Read more at The Daily Beast.
