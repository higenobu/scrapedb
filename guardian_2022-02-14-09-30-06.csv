2/14/2022,"One of the most prominent critics of the Morrison government’s handling of Covid-19 outbreaks in aged care has entered the race to replace health minister Greg Hunt in the seat of Flinders. Dr Sarah Russell, a public health researcher and the director of Aged Care Matters, was selected by the Voices of Mornington Peninsula group on Sunday evening to contest the Liberal-held seat at the May election.  Russell is one of a number of high-profile women challenging Liberal members in ordinarily safe seats, seeking to capitalise on concern about Coalition climate change policy and lack of action on a national integrity commission. Russell told the preselection meeting she had been an aged care advocate for six years and climate activist for 30, seeking endorsement to help defeat “the worst government we have had in my lifetime”. “It is unforgivable that all political parties – including the Greens – who know the evidence and understand the science to have chosen to politicise climate action,” she said. Russell previously contested the inner north Melbourne seat of Cooper for Fiona Patten’s Reason Australia party, garnering just 2% of the vote, but will be on home turf in Flinders, as she lives in Mount Martha on a property that was owned by her grandparents since 1935. Russell has been a critic of the pace of the vaccine booster rollout in aged care, and workforce shortages that have caused poor standards of care during the Omicron outbreak. Russell joins a crowded field in which local councillor Despi O’Connor is also contesting Flinders as an independent, a decision Russell has slammed as “having a bet each ways” after O’Connor had expressed interest in running as the Voices candidate. Russell replaces Claire Boardman, who resigned in December as the deputy public health commander for infection prevention and control in the Victorian health department’s Covid-19 team to contest the seat as the Voices candidate but pulled out due to the difficulty of winning with a split independent vote. Hunt won Flinders in 2019 with a 46.7% primary vote and 55.6% two-party-preferred, defeating Labor despite a challenge from former Liberal MP Julia Banks, who won 13.8% of the vote as an independent. Hunt is retiring at the 2022 election, potentially putting the seat in play. Zoe McKenzie, a former National Broadband Network director and trade adviser, is contesting the seat for the Liberals. Scott Morrison is yet to say who would replace Hunt as health minister if he wins a fourth term for the Coalition. In comments to Guardian Australia, Russell acknowledged the race to replace Hunt had become a “clusterfuck” and promised to be a strident voice for the climate-conscious community if elected to federal parliament. “I’ll be the Jacqui Lambie of the left,” she said. Russell also cited the independent candidate for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, as inspiration for the run. Russell told the meeting she hopes that “all independents agree to give preferences to each other and put Liberals last” in the contest.",News/Australia news,‘I’ll be the Jacqui Lambie of the left’: Dr Sarah Russell enters election race to replace Greg Hunt in Flinders ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/ill-be-the-jacqui-lambie-of-the-left-dr-sarah-russell-enters-election-race-to-replace-greg-hunt-in-flinders
2/14/2022,"A coalition of hundreds of pro-refugee organisations has estimated the astronomical costs of five Home Office policies to block refugees, which are due to become law in a matter of months. The campaign coalition Together With Refugees, which is made up of about 360 community groups, refugee organisations, trades unions and faith groups, is publishing a report on Monday. It attempts to calculate the cost of policies such as offshoring refugees – with the bill running into the billions. The Home Office is yet to publish this information itself.  Taxpayers could face an extra £2.7bn a year cost to fund the schemes, according to the paper – named A Bill at What Price? It is being published before the first vote in the House of Lords on the government’s controversial nationality and borders bill. The Home Office dismissed the calculations as “pure speculation”, but the SNP MP Stuart McDonald said the research “shows in stark terms what many MPs have long feared about the huge cost to the taxpayer”. The MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East added: “I and others have continually pressed the government to set out their own assessment of these costs, via the impact assessment they are required to produce for such legislation – and which they have repeatedly promised, but failed, to provide to the public and parliament.” Using open source data, the report calculated the extra spending that will be needed to pay for five key measures proposed in the bill. These projects include: New large, out-of-town accommodation centres to house up to 8,000 people seeking refugee protection – £717.6m a year. An offshore processing system to send people seeking refugee protection to another country to be detained while they wait for a decision on their claim, based on Australian government costings, which the Home Office said it is modelling its plans on – £1.44bn a year. Imprisoning people seeking refugee protection who arrive via irregular routes, such as in a small boat across the Channel – £432m a year. Removing people seeking refugee protection from the UK to another country if the government said they should claim asylum elsewhere – £117.4m a year. Extra processing costs for additional assessments of people allocated a new temporary protection status, who have already passed a rigorous assessment recognising them as a refugee, every two and a half years – £1.5m a year. Sabir Zazai, a spokesperson for Together With Refugees, said: “This is an astonishing amount of additional public money for the unworkable and cruel proposals in the bill – enough to pay for more than 80,000 NHS nurses a year. “Having fled their homes in fear and struggled to find safety, these measures would leave women, children and men facing further hardship in prison, isolated in another country indefinitely, separated from family and facing insecurity and indecision.” Together With Refugees is calling for an end to the proposal in the bill to treat people differently based on how they arrive here, rather than the dangers they face in their home countries. It is also calling for more safe routes for people to reach protection, asking the government to agree a target to resettle 10,000 of the world’s most vulnerable refugees a year. A Home Office spokesperson said: “These figures are pure speculation. While lives are being lost in the Channel we will look at all options available to us. Our broken asylum system is costing the taxpayer an unacceptable £4.7m a day on hotels, which is why urgent reform is needed. “Our New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken asylum system so that we spend less time and money on those abusing the system, enabling us to focus on helping those in genuine need.”",News/UK news,Refugee group warns of ‘astonishing’ cost of new Home Office policies,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/refugee-group-warns-of-astonishing-cost-of-new-home-office-policies
2/14/2022,"British employers are expecting to award pay rises of 3% in 2022, the highest in at least a decade, though well below the rate of inflation, as they try to recruit and retain workers, according to a new survey of businesses. The expected pay rise comes amid persistent signs of a tight labour market, with almost two-thirds of employers expecting to have difficulties filling job vacancies in the coming six months, according to a survey of more than 1,000 recruitment and human resources workers by YouGov for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).  Pay growth has risen sharply higher than it was before the pandemic, thanks in part to the pace of the economic recovery following coronavirus lockdowns at the start of the pandemic in 2020. Average weekly earnings rose by 4.2% year on year in the three months to November 2021, faster than at any point between the financial crisis in 2008 and the start of the pandemic in 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics. The latest data on wages and employment will be published on Tuesday, with economists expecting pay growth to slow, but remain above pre-pandemic levels. The CIPD reported that more than two-thirds of recruiters were expecting to hire by the end of March, and that plans to make workers redundant were lower than before the pandemic. Almost half of the recruiters surveyed said they were struggling to fill vacancies, and 41% said more staff were leaving – a phenomenon that has been dubbed the “great resignation” as workers look for better opportunities elsewhere. As well as headline pay rises, workers have been able to win other benefits, ranging from hybrid working at home or offices to a four-day week with no loss of pay. There have been particular difficulties attracting workers in sectors like hospitality, which have been hit by the drop in immigration caused by the pandemic and Brexit. Salaries for jobs in hospitality have increased by up to 12%, with a record number offering a wage of more than £50,000, according to Caterer.com, a recruitment website. The 3% median pay rise expected by CIPD members would nevertheless result in a real wage cut for many because of price rises across the UK economy. Inflation has risen to its highest level in 30 years as companies cover rising costs because of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and a surge in energy prices. Annual consumer prices index inflation hit 5.4% in December, and the Bank of England expects it to rise as high as 7% in the spring. Jonathan Boys, the CIPD’s labour market economist, said: “Even though businesses anticipate making record pay awards to their employees this year, most people are set to see their real wages fall against the backdrop of high inflation.” Boys said it was encouraging that more employers were considering other options to keep staff, such as providing flexible working and spending more on training and other perks such as health benefits. Those practices “should reduce wage inflation pressure to a degree”, he said. Some economists are looking for signs of a so-called wage-price spiral, in which workers demand higher pay to compensate for higher prices for the goods and services they consume – although others say that pay rises are long overdue in many countries. In the UK, workers have gone through the worst extended period for real wage growth since the Napoleonic wars, and real wages are still less than they were before the financial crisis that started in 2008, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. The expected pay rises reported by CIPD members were the highest since at least the winter of 2012, the earliest comparable data. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, this month provoked fury from unions – and unusually similar front pages for the broadsheet Financial Times and the tabloid Daily Star – after calling for workers to go without pay rises to control inflation. Unions and economists pointed out that Bailey did not call for companies to hold prices steady at the same time.",News/Business,"UK employers expecting to award pay rises of 3% this year, survey shows",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/uk-employers-expecting-to-award-pay-rises-of-3-this-year-survey-shows
2/14/2022,"UK ministers and the Scottish government have reached a deal over proposed freeports in Scotland, after months of disagreement over what No 10 has billed as one of the main economic benefits of Brexit. The Scottish government had resisted the idea of freeports – specific areas that offer tax breaks and other incentives to investors – which are intended to revitalise deprived areas but have been accused of encouraging tax avoidance and lower regulation.  Scottish ministers instead proposed the idea of green ports, based around low-emission industries and fair work practices. The deal appears to follow this model, but with the compromise name of “green freeports”. The plan proposed two green freeports, which can be rail or air hubs as well as seaports. They can apply alongside other local businesses, as well as the council and other public bodies. A bidding process for the two locations will run from this spring until summer, with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, which is leading the process, saying it hopes the sites will be running by spring next year. Any consortium submitting a bid “must guarantee that local communities will benefit from it, as well as delivering on ambitious targets for net zero”, the joint announcement said. In July last year, the Scottish government released a longlist of areas being considered for its own green port plans: Dundee; a series of areas around the Firth of Forth; a similar collection of sites around Glasgow; Cairnryan, a port near Stranraer; Shetland; Orkney; Aberdeen and Peterhead; and Montrose. For the green freeports the process will start again, with both the Scottish and UK governments assessing the bids and having an equal say on the choice. In an announcement featuring quotes from Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove as well as himself, the prime minister hailed the wider freeports concept as “truly transformational”, saying: “I am delighted that people across Scotland will reap the benefits that will come from having two new green freeports.” Kate Forbes, Scotland’s finance secretary, said: “I am pleased we have been able to reach an agreement on a joint approach that recognises the distinct needs of Scotland and enshrines the Scottish government’s commitment to achieving net zero and embedding fair work practices through public investment.” Eight freeports in England have already been confirmed, with tax breaks including no stamp duty, full rebates for construction and machinery investment, five years of zero business rates, and lower tariffs and customs obligations. Most will be around busy coastal cargo ports – Felixstowe, Liverpool, Hull, Southampton and London Gateway. The others are Plymouth, Teesside and a zone around East Midlands airport. Rishi Sunak has said that the tax free zones will generate investment in deprived areas of the country. Ahead of the deal to leave the EU it was claimed the government was unable to press ahead with plans while inside the single market and customs union and that the subsidised areas would form part of the “Brexit dividend”. In 2020, the EU announced a review of the 82 freeports across the continent after identifying that their special tariff and duty status aided the financing of terrorism, money laundering and organised crime.",News/UK news,UK and Scottish government agree deal on freeports in Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/uk-scottish-government-agree-green-freeports-scotland
2/14/2022,"A drive to encourage women eligible for cervical screening to book and attend their appointments has been launched in England to prevent cancer deaths. The campaign comes as an online survey of 3,003 women aged 25-64 who were eligible for cervical screening, conducted last month, revealed that 42% of respondents cited embarrassment as preventing them from attending, while 34% said they kept putting it off and 28% said they were concerned it would be painful.  Cervical cancer develops when abnormal cells in the cervix – the neck of the womb that is connected to the vagina – grow out of control. The disease is the second most common cancer among women under the age of 35 in England; figures from 2019 suggest that about two women in England die every day from the disease. However, the latest figures for England from NHS Digital reveal that between April 2020 and March 2021 about 30% of women aged 25-64 who were eligible were not adequately screened. The Department of Health and Social Care is launching an awareness campaign to increase the uptake of life-saving screening. Supported by the NHS, the campaign Help Us Help You – Cervical Screening Saves Lives includes a film featuring the GP Dr Zoe Williams chatting to familiar faces, including the Loose Women panellist Linda Robson and the drag queen Victoria Scone – as well as discussing common questions and worries about screening. Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said cervical screening saved lives. “By screening for risk signs at an early stage, it means that any abnormal cells can be treated quickly before they potentially develop into cancer,” she said. “We know it can feel embarrassing or feel like something that you can easily put off, but accepting your invite and getting checked could save your life. And please do speak to your GP practice about any concerns you might have – we are here to help you.” The survey also revealed the proportion of those who had never attended cervical screening was higher among lesbian or bisexual women than those over 25 in general. Scone said, as a queer woman, she was initially uncertain whether cervical screening was imperative. “However, this new campaign has clarified that all women and people with a cervix, including those in the LGBTQ+ community like myself, are eligible for a screening, so I booked myself in,” she said. The development of vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) has prevented thousands of people from developing the disease or pre-cancers. However, the jabs are only free in England under the universal programme for those who have yet to reach their 25th birthday, and the vaccines do not prevent all cases of cervical cancer: even those who have had the jabs still need to go for screening when invited. The screening procedure takes a few minutes and involves the gentle insertion of a smooth, cylinder-shaped tool into the vagina before a soft brush is used to take a sample from the cervix. The sample is then tested for certain types of HPV and, if present, the cells are examined for abnormalities. If necessary, further investigations and treatments can then be offered to prevent the chance of cancer developing. The Gogglebox star Scarlett Moffatt, who also participated in the film, said cervical screening may have saved her life. “The screening detected HPV and abnormal cells linked to the development of cervical cancer, and I underwent treatment to have the cells removed,” she said. “If I hadn’t been to that appointment, I don’t know what situation I would have been in now.”",News/Society,Campaign aims to boost cervical screening rates in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/14/campaign-aims-to-boost-cervical-screening-rates-in-england
2/14/2022,"Russell T Davies, whose five-part drama It’s A Sin centred on the lives lost to Aids in the 1980s, has been named the most influential name in television in an annual list compiled by industry experts, with the drama’s leading star, Olly Alexander, taking second spot. Strictly winner Rose Ayling-Ellis, whose performance raised awareness of hearing impairments, came third, while the creators of Squid Game, Hwang Dong-hyuk, and Succession, Jesse Armstrong, two of the biggest international television shows of 2021, completed the top five.  The RadioTimes.com TV 100 2021 list, recognised the top 100 people in front of and behind the camera in 2021, according to leading figures from across the creative industries, including Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s director of content, and Anne Mensah, the vice-president of content at Netflix. Davies’s Channel 4 drama was “far and away” the obvious winner, said Morgan Jeffery, the executive editor of entertainment website RadioTimes.com. He described It’s a Sin as a “beautiful tribute to lives lost to the Aids epidemic – a stunning piece of work, it challenged stigma, sparked conversations and even led to charity drives raising hundreds of thousands for HIV charities”. Davies, whose previous successful works include Queer as Folk, The Second Coming, and the 2005 revival of Dr Who, was acclaimed as a “powerhouse of ideas” and “one step ahead of the trends”, by Nicola Shindler, the executive producer at Quay Street Productions. Alexander, who played Ritchie in It’s a Sin, was described as “central to the show’s impact, vividly bringing to life the realities of the Aids crisis in the 1980s in the gay community” by Zai Bennett, the managing director of content at Sky. Ayling-Ellis, the first deaf actor to star in EastEnders, had “defied stereotypes to prove that hearing impairments need not be a barrier”, said Moore. Of her appearance on Strictly, Moore added: “That electrifying moment in the middle of primetime TV when she covered Giovanni’s ears and danced without sound for 10 seconds, 10 million people experienced the world through Rose’s eyes and ears. It was mesmerising and an extraordinary tribute to the deaf community.” Kate Winslet made the top 10 for her performance in Mare of Easttown, as did the teenage tennis player Emma Raducanu for winning the US Open. Stephen Graham was also in the top 10, with judges hailing his “extraordinary year”, including his nuanced performance as Tony in Jack Thorne’s Help to his Bafta-nominated chef in Boiling Point. The England men’s football team at the delayed 2020 Euros was also a highlight, coming in 10th position.

2/14/2022,"Europe’s biggest banks led by HSBC, Barclays and BNP Paribas have provided £24bn to oil and gas companies that are expanding production less than a year since pledging to target net zero carbon emissions, data shows. Investments to drill new oil wells and tap fresh gas reserves, backed by funds from major banks, appear to contradict commitments to international agreements and undermine efforts to accelerate the switch to renewable energy sources, the report said.  Banks have acknowledged that they have an important role in the transition away from fossil fuels, and last April many signed up to the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which requires they set targets to reduce carbon emissions. However, analysis by campaign group ShareAction showed that 25 banks that signed up to reduce emissions have provided $33bn (£24bn) in loans and other financing to 50 companies with large oil and gas expansion plans. The oil companies include America’s ExxonMobil, which has tried to defy shareholder demands to cut emissions, state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco and London-listed Shell and BP who have made huge profits from gas price increases in recent months. Since 2016, the European banks have provided financing worth $406bn. Climate scientists and economists have warned that stopping expansion of oil and gas production is vital to reducing global carbon emissions, the key driver of the climate crisis. The International Energy Agency last May said no new oil and gas fields should be exploited to give the world a chance of reaching net zero by 2050 and avoid global heating of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. There is also a growing consensus in the investment community that oil and gas assets could be financially damaging investments – although there are also likely to be many profitable opportunities for those willing to ignore criticisms. Highlighting the pushback from international investors keen to limit the costs of shifting away from fossil fuels, a report last week by the accountants EY found that 70% of UK firms admit they have encountered resistance from investors and shareholders about their plans to reduce emissions, with 42% saying their shareholders want them to wait for competitors to act first. Xavier Lerin, ShareAction’s senior research manager, said: “If oil and gas demand decreases in line with 1.5C scenarios, prices would fall and assets become stranded. On the other hand, if demand did not fall enough to limit global warming to 1.5C, the economy would suffer from severe physical climate impacts. Either way, value will be destroyed for energy companies, banks and their investors.” More than half ($19bn) of the financing since the net zero agreement came from four of alliance’s founders. They were London-headquartered HSBC and Barclays, France’s BNP Paribas and Germany’s Deutsche Bank. HSBC, Barclays and BNP Paribas also provided the most finance to these companies since 2016, at $59bn, $48bn and $46bn respectively. A spokesperson for the NZBA secretariat, based in the United Nations, said that members who joined the alliance in April 2021 were due to set their first 2030 targets in the autumn of 2022, focusing on the biggest polluters including oil and gas companies. Targets must “align with no/low-overshoot 1.5°C transition pathways as specified by credible science-based climate scenarios”, the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for HSBC said the bank would publish science-based targets for oil, gas and power companies on 22 February. “We are committed to working with our customers to achieve a transition towards a thriving low carbon economy,” they said. A Barclays spokesperson said the bank had set “a target for a 15% absolute reduction in our financed emissions from energy, including coal, oil and gas, by 2025”, as well as restrictions on fossil fuel exploration in the Arctic, as part of an “ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050”. A BNP Paribas spokesperson said it had financed mainly “European energy companies that are largely committed to transitioning their model” and who would “accelerate transition by developing renewable energy and other transformative solutions”. The spokesperson added that there had been a “significant decrease in the support granted by BNP Paribas to oil and gas players in 2021 compared to 2019”, but that there was a “totally atypical” need for extra financial support during 2020. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said carbon-intensive sectors were “only a small share of our loan book” and less than peers. The bank would have an “intense dialogue with clients to move from high-carbon business models towards low and no-carbon ones”, the spokesperson added.",News/Business,Europe’s biggest banks provide £24bn to oil and gas firms despite net zero pledges,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/europes-biggest-banks-provide-24bn-to-oil-and-gas-firms-despite-net-zero-pledges
