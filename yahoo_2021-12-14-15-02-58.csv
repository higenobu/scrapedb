12/14/2021,"While you might never see another stimulus check from Washington, drivers across the country are still getting cash in the mail from their insurers. Car insurance companies have been squeezed for more money ever since last year, when they made huge profits and offered only modest discounts and rebates in return. Now a new wave of $400 refunds is coming to some drivers after a group of insurers were accused of hoarding billions in surplus cash. If you feel like you've been paying too much for your coverage, here's how to get your own check — or at least get a break from your insurer. The latest round of refunds is coming to drivers in Michigan, who are getting $400 back for each vehicle they own. “Billions in surplus funds should not be held by insurers to invest for their own profit or be conditioned on renewal of a policy,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wrote in a letter last month. Whitmer had accused the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association — which charges drivers an annual fee to cover the cost of personal injury claims — of holding on to $5 billion more than necessary. The insurance companies that make up the association quickly agreed to part with roughly $3 billion of the surplus. The money will be freed up in early March and distributed to policyholders within 60 days. While the refund is welcome relief, it's only a one-time deal — meaning drivers in Michigan and across the country will need to look elsewhere for significant, lasting savings. Though it's not the case in Michigan, most complaints in other states are related to overcharging during the pandemic. When the streets were empty and accidents few, Progressive reported an 82% increase in net income. Geico’s pretax earnings tripled during the second and third quarters of 2020. Insurance providers voluntarily gave out more than $14 billion in refunds last year, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association says, but many critics aren't satisfied. “On behalf of consumers, I am out of patience,” California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara wrote in October, giving three of the stingier companies 30 days to ""tell us once and for all how they are going to make it right.” A state analysis found that insurers returned an average of 9% of auto premiums from March to September 2020, but the Insurance Department estimates they should have refunded nearly double that amount. Washington and New Mexico are also assessing whether drivers got enough money back, and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has sent several pointed letters to the state's insurance regulator. The conflict has even ended up in the courts, with class-action lawsuits filed this year in Nevada and Illinois. Unless more regulators step in or the class-action suits succeed, insurers won’t be forced by law to hand out more money than they already have. Most rebates provided last year were minimal; it was rare to get back more than half a month’s premium. On average, advocacy groups say, insurers shortchanged policyholders $125 per vehicle. But some companies didn’t issue refunds or cut rates at all unless customers called and asked. If you haven’t contacted your insurer yet, you might have free cash waiting for you. And with pressure mounting, your provider might be open to reviewing your premium, especially if you’re still driving less than before. But if your insurance company refuses to give you a pandemic discount, you can try a couple other ways to cut your insurance bill: Some auto insurance policies include extras that you may be able to do without for a while. For example, can you cut out the option that pays for a rental car while yours is at the repair shop? Removing these extras can save you a few bucks. Just make sure you’re still meeting your state’s minimum liability coverage and are protected in case of an accident during those trips to the grocery store. If your insurer won’t give you a break, maybe you can find a new one that will. Drivers who haven’t done any comparison shopping over the last six months could be overpaying by more than $1,000 per year. With a free quote-comparing service, you could find a better price in just a few minutes. If saving on car insurance isn’t enough, here are a few more ways to give your bank account a boost until the economy bounces all the way back. Stop overpaying online. It’s impossible to find the best price on your own when there are thousands of stores on the internet. Try using a free browser extension that automatically applies coupon codes and tracks down lower prices when you shop online. Cut the cost of your debt. If you’ve relied on credit cards throughout the pandemic, expensive interest is bound to catch up with you. A lower-interest debt consolidation loan can fold your balances into a single, lower-interest payment — and help you find freedom from your debt sooner. Invest your spare change. Using a popular investing app, you can automatically invest the “change” left over from everyday purchases. You won't even notice the deposits as you build or round out your investing plan.

12/14/2021,"Rags to riches is a common trope in our storytelling. Some people actually live it, and few more so than hedge fund billionaire Israel Englander. Using $35 million in seed money, Englander started Millennium Management – and by 2019 his firm was managing over $39 billion. As of this year, that number is up to $57 billion. In 2020, Millennium brought in a total of $10.2 billion for its investors, and Englander took home $3.8 billion in personal earnings – which made him the highest paid fund manager on Wall Street. So, investors seeking strong returns can do a lot worse than to follow Englander’s stock buys. We’ve done just that, using the TipRanks platform to pull up details on three stocks in which Englander staked out new positions. The platform revealed that each has earned a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus and boasts significant upside potential. Let's take a closer look. Nuvation Bio (NUVB) We'll start with Nuvation, a clinical-stage biopharma company involved in oncological research. Nuvation is investigating ‘differentiated and novel’ therapeutic agents, testing their potential to meet unmet needs in cancer treatment. The company’s pipeline, which features new drug candidates for the treatment of a wide range of cancers is mostly in the preclinical stages - but there is one Phase 1 study with enrollment ongoing. That study focuses on drug candidate NUV-422, a CDK 2/4/6 inhibitor, as a treatment for high grade gliomas, a form of brain cancer. Preclinical testing showed that the drug crossed the blood-brain barrier, and limits various causes of toxicity. The Phase 1/2 study was started in December of last year, and continues to enroll patients. The company expects to release data from the Phase 1 portion of the study next year. In addition to this study, the company has recently announced FDA clearance for two new Investigational New Drug Applications for NUV-22, in the treatment of prostate cancer and advanced breast cancer. Nuvation has several more INDAs planned for submission by 2026, in the treatment of various solid tumors and hematologic cancers. Englander was impressed enough with Nuvation's situation to buy in, staking a new position of 373,471 shares in Q3. These are currently worth $3.52 million. The hedge billionaire isn’t Nuvation’s only fan. RBC analyst Kennen MacKay lays out a clear case for optimism in this company: “We continue to like NUVB at these early stages as they progress towards de-risking events… The expansion cohorts continue enrollment with the expectation of the first Ph1 data readout in 2022. In the Q3 report, the company reiterated their previous timeline for trial enrollment and data readout, providing confidence in the ability for the company to execute during these early stages of development. We believe this positions the company well with multiple 'shots-on-goal' with their lead asset.” To this end, MacKay rates NUVB an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $15 price target implies an upside of 59% for the coming year. (To watch MacKay’s track record, click here) The RBC view is far from the only positive analyst report on Nuvation; the company has received unanimously positive reviews in recent weeks for a Strong Buy consensus. NUVB shares are trading for $9.13, and their average price target of $16 suggests room for a 69% upside from that level. (See NUVB stock forecast on TipRanks) Thorne HealthTech (THRN) For the next stock, we’ll stay in the healthcare segment – but take a very different look at it. Thorne is a leader in the health tech industry, offering customers – individuals, healthcare professionals, corporations, and health care plan providers – a science-driven, personalized approach to keeping up health and well-being. Customers can get actionable insights based on personalized data, insights that inform their choice of products and services to improve and maintain health outcomes. This is a new stock in the public markets. Thorne held its IPO in September of this year. The company put 7 million shares on the market at $10 each, meeting the initial pricing and raising $70 million gross capital. In its first financial report as a public company, for 3Q21, released in November, Thorne showed several positive metric. Gross margins came in at over 53%, a near-record for the company, and revenue, at $48 million, beat the forecast by 6%. It’s clear that Englander liked what he saw in Thorne – his firm bought 492,928 shares in the company in Q3. At the current valuation, this is worth $3.39 million. In coverage of Thorne for RBC, analyst Sean Dodge writes: “While the supplements space is fragmented, Thorne has established itself as a premium brand with an impressive list of partners. Moreover, we believe the company has underinvested in sales and marketing, leaving a substantial opportunity to capture share in a large, growing market with a heightened focus on preventative health. Further, its Onegevity data and analytics platform provides additional B2B growth opportunities, in our view enough to sustain 30%+ revenue growth for several years. While EBITDA will likely see some compression as the company ramps marketing spend, adjusted EBITDA margins should remain positive and resume an upward trajectory toward the company’s 18–20% long-term target."" In line with these comments, Dodge gives the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a price target of $11, suggesting it has room for 65% upside by the end of next year. (To watch Dodge’s track record, click here) Overall, Thorne has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 positive reviews. The stock is trading for $6.61 and its average price target of $11.50 indicates a potential 74% upside from that level. (See THRN stock forecast on TipRanks) Hyzon Motors (HYZN) Last on our list, Hyzon Motors, is a ‘green’ automaker, an appellation that can apply to both the company and the product. Hyzon is developing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, an alternative to battery-powered electric cars. Hydrogen fuel cell tech has potential to power passenger and commercial vehicles, while emitting only water as a by-product. Hyzon’s focus is commercial vehicles and trucks. The company has a facility in Rochester, New York, that produces 150kW fuel cells, and is gearing up to produce 370kW systems. These will generate the equivalent of 500 horsepower, and will be suitable for a range of heavy-duty commercial applications, including mining vehicles, marine vessels, and inter-city rail locomotives. Hyzon in recent weeks has been pursuing moves into the Chinese commercial vehicle market. The company on December 8 announced that it had delivered 29 fuel cell electric trucks, 49 ton models, to a major steel conglomerate in that country. The delivery was facilitated by the Shanghai Hydrogen HongYun Automotive Company. The trucks use 170kW power cells and are expected to eliminate up to 140 tons of CO2 during their lifetimes. That deliver followed another trial delivery, of eight dump trucks to the Foshan Municipality. The delivery to Foshan is part of a trial, to see if fuel cell tech can replace diesel fuel. Because it has not yet begun regular production, but is instead still delivering small orders for trial use, Hyzon has a revenue stream of only $968,000. The company reported a solid balance sheet in the most recent quarter, 3Q21, with $498 million in liquid assets available. Izzy Englander is clearly not worried by Hyzon’s speculative nature, and bought 1,356,081 shares in the firm in Q3. This stake is worth $9.11 million at current prices. Analyst Richard Ryan, from Colliers Securities, is another fan of this stock, writing, “The company has seen supply chain headwinds during 3Q21, but will likely find success in mitigating future disruption because of a pivot into the Chinese market over the European market. The foray into China will likely prove to be critical to HYZN's ability to receive necessary parts for production and maintain their guided delivery count.” These comments back up a Buy rating on the stock, and Ryan’s $15 price target implies a 120% upside ahead. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here) All in all, Hyzon’s analyst reviews break down 3 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating, and the $13 average price target suggests a potential for ~91% upside from the trading price of $6.78.

12/14/2021,"Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger tends to be much more direct with his warnings and criticisms than his business partner, Warren Buffett. Munger didn’t mince words when he said earlier this month that he considers today’s stock market environment “even crazier than the dot-com era.” ""I just can't stand participating in these insane booms,” Munger said at the Sohn Hearts & Minds Investment Leaders Conference. “There's no great company that can't be turned into a bad investment just by raising the price."" Munger, as usual, had harsh words for cryptocurrencies. He praised China’s crackdown on crypto and said he wished the technology “had never been invented.” One way to avoid both crypto and getting burned by an overvalued market is to look at companies with stock that has dropped but seems poised for a rebound. Here are three stocks with some bruises that fit that category. You might even be able to include some undervalued stocks in your portfolio with a little spare change. Disney’s stock got hammered in the pandemic’s early days, shedding about 38% of its value in the month ending March 20, 2020. After rallying for much of last year, it’s down almost 15% since the beginning of 2021. Disney’s earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Oct. 2, came in about $200 million short of expectations. Its theme parks are still operating at reduced capacity, so Q4’s results could have been much worse. Streaming platform Disney+ is up to 118.1 million subscribers, and the company projects that figure will grow to more than 230 million by 2024. While the company says Disney+ subscriber growth slowed, revenue from subscriptions across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu was $4.6 billion in Q4 — 38% higher than a year before. Disney remains a beloved global brand and says it expects international visitors to parks to pick up later in 2022 as restrictions ease. JPMorgan Chase predicts a full economic rebound from COVID-19 in 2022, and if that’s true, Disney’s theme parks could once again be packed. Mastercard’s stock has been mostly trending downward since July, and it recently hit the skids, shrinking by 17% from Nov. 16 through Dec. 1. However, it’s trending upward over the last week or so, recovering most of that recent loss. The sell-off of Mastercard’s stock doesn’t appear to have anything to do with the company’s performance. Q3 net revenue was $5 billion, a year-over-year increase of 30%. Purchase volume was up 23% over the same period. Mastercard’s in a tricky position. Buy now, pay later apps are doing their best to disrupt the credit card space, and the company doesn’t currently seem to have an answer that will help increase the company’s cache with younger users. But that could be more of a long-term issue. In the short-term, inflation-jacked prices mean customers are paying more, and a rebound in tourism and credit card spending should have the company’s users — there’s almost a billion of them — ringing up purchases left and right. AT&T’s stock has been on a downward tumble for a while now. Its share price is 45% lower than it was five years ago, and is down more than 22% this year alone. AT&T has taken some big swings that haven’t paid off. Its purchase of DirecTV and Time Warner in 2015 and 2018, respectively, added more than $130 billion in debt to the company’s balance sheet. Last year, T-Mobile replaced AT&T as America’s second-largest wireless carrier. None of that sounds particularly enticing, but the company knows changes need to be made. It divested a number of its smaller businesses and some of its real estate holdings and sold 30% of DirecTV to streamline operations and free up capital for the expansion of its 5G network, which could be huge. AT&T is still a risky buy with its stumbles this year, but if you believe in the turnaround plan, the anxiety might be worthwhile. Big picture, AT&T continues to boast the scale advantages required to compete in the high-growth wireless space long term. With elite investors like Charlie Munger, Michael Burry and Jeremy Grantham all saying the market is due for a correction, it might be worth looking into investments other than stocks. There’s no shortage of unique alternative assets you can invest in that have little correlation with the stock market, including luxury vehicles, commercial real estate, blue-chip artworks or even marine finance. Traditionally, many alternative asset classes have only been available to millionaires because of the enormous costs involved. But a new platform is making these opportunities available to retail investors too. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/14/2021,"With inflation rates surging at rates not seen in decades, many consumers are wondering how to keep rising prices from negatively affecting their savings and spending habits.  Prices on consumer goods and services including food, energy, and housing have been rising for the past few months. They jumped again in November, rising to 6.8% over the previous year, according to the latest consumer price index data released Friday. Along with rising prices this year, there have also been supply-chain bottlenecks and rising consumer demand—all of which can cause real challenges as the average American’s purchasing power degrades over time. While the effects of inflation are not easily avoided, several financial planners tell Fortune that there are steps consumers can take to duck the worst effects.  Putting off a major purchase may be the right option now, especially on a new car, says Jay Zigmont, a certified financial planner (CFP) and founder of Mississippi-based financial firm Live, Learn, Plan. “If your car works and gets you to work, then stick with it,” he says.  That’s because while auto loan rates are low, the cost of new cars has surged 11.1% over the past year, according to the consumer price index. But inflation on used cars is even worse—up 31.4% over the past year. Zigmont says in general, car prices have gotten a “bit disconnected from reality,” and consumers need to ask themselves if they really need a new car right now. “Try paying for a complete detailing of your car and it will feel new to you without the sticker shock,” he says. For those with car leases running out in the next few months, financial planner Chris Diodato says it may be worth buying out the lease rather than shopping around for a new car or lease. Buyout prices, which are indicated on the initial lease contract, have been far below current resale value, says Diodato, a CFP and founder of Florida-based WELLth Financial Planning.  One thing that makes inflation particularly difficult for savers is the low-interest-rate environment that the U.S. has been experiencing, says Matt Elliott, a CFP and founder of Minnesota-based Pulse Financial Planning. “Your cash at the bank makes close to no interest, yet prices are increasing on everything you buy. That can cause your purchasing power to degrade over time if you aren’t invested,” Elliott says. He recommends consumers consider investing in a diversified portfolio that includes investments that will go up with inflation, such as Series I savings bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). I bonds, for example, currently offer an interest rate of 7.12% through April 2022. Yet while the interest rate on Series I bonds is attractive, financial planner Jovan Johnson says investors need to put in the effort to understand how these work and how that can impact their timeline for this money. For instance, investors are generally limited to buying $10,000 worth of I bonds annually per person, and you can’t sell these bonds for at least 12 months. If you redeem them in less than five years, then you’ll forfeit three months of interest, says Johnson, a CFP and owner of Georgia-based Piece of Wealth Planning. “Overall, I believe that I bonds are a very secure and great place to park your money if you don't need this money for at least one year,” he adds. “Many young people sit with lots of extra cash as they are unsure what to do with it, but that can be harmful now,” says Thomas Kopelman, cofounder of Indiana-based AllStreet Wealth. “You should only have cash for an emergency fund, as well as cash for short-term goals (vacation, down payment of house, etc.), then you need to invest the rest.” More than any other strategy, financial planner Elliott Appel recommends shifting what you buy from items that are highly impacted by inflation, to items that have escaped the worst of it. “Not all items have seen the same rate of inflation,” adds Appel, a CFP and founder of Wisconsin-based Kindness Financial Planning.  Most consumers, for instance, have noticed grocery bills going up, but much of those cost increases are tied to rising prices for animal-derived products, says Andy Baxley, an Illinois-based CFP with the Planning Center. “Experimenting with plant-based dishes is one way to reduce pain at the checkout counter. I am encouraging folks to get creative with their budgets right now,” he says.  Or maybe instead of buying beef, buy chicken. Beef prices have risen 20.9% in the past 12 months, according to the latest consumer price index. Chicken prices increased only 9.2% over the past year, and the cost of other uncooked poultry products, including turkey, is up only 4.6%. Meanwhile, shelf-stable fish and seafood such as canned tuna haven't seen any increases. “You can research what's gone up the most over the past year and perhaps buy less of it,” Appel says. This is a good time to reconsider your overall spending, says Dana Menard, a CFP and founder of Minnesota-based Twin Cities Wealth Strategies.  “When necessities begin to cost more, discretionary spending should be reevaluated so as to not neglect the things that are necessary,” he says.  This may be as simple as getting rid of or canceling unused subscriptions, but Menard says it’s important to consider where and how you're spending your money. That's especially true around the holidays, when people make impulsive purchases, and gift-buying can sometimes trump logic. Although it might not be easy to make these changes right now, Elliott says the good news is that many financial experts and economists predict the current rates of high inflation will start to subside. “While heightened inflation could be temporary, it may be best to hope for the best, but prepare your finances in case we see sustained inflation over the longer term.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•12 hours ago,Here’s what 8 financial planners say you should do with your money during inflation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-financial-planners-money-during-181740129.html
