3/11/2022,"Mounds of abandoned clothes and other personal items lie strewn along corridors leading out of Ukraine. The farther people carry their things, the harder it is, so they leave them behind, said Ludmila Sokol, a gym teacher fleeing Zaporizhzhia in the south. But their pets, they keep alongside them. Everywhere amid the exodus of more than 2.3 million people fleeing Russia’s invasion are the pets people could not leave behind: birds, rabbits, hamsters, cats and dogs. People fleeing the outskirts of Kyiv crowded together under a destroyed bridge, carrying little luggage and abandoning their vehicles on the road. But their pets remained with them. One woman ferried her dog across an improvised bridge over the Irpin River amid the evacuation. Another at a train station in Poland nuzzled her orange cat, nose to nose. A young girl wrapped in an aluminized blanket hugged her two Chihuahuas close as she made the crossing into Medyka, Poland. A woman who made it to Romania cuddled her small dog as they sat in a hotel ballroom converted into a refugee shelter. One woman said she felt an obligation to keep not only her family but her pets safe. Victoria Trofimenko, 42, had originally planned never to leave Kyiv, she said in an interview with The Associated Press by Zoom days after the war started. But as the missiles and explosives rained down she thought about her duty to protect her 18-year-old daughter, 69-year-old mother — and her dog, Akira, and cat, Galileo. She bought train tickets to head west, ending up in Prague. She said she first arrived in Hungary, though, and was grateful to have Akira by her side for protection. “I can’t leave dogs or cats. I have to take responsibility,” she said.",World/Associated Press,AP PHOTOS: Ukrainians fleeing war 'can't leave' pets behind,https://news.yahoo.com/ap-photos-ukrainians-fleeing-war-173619495.html
3/11/2022,"When Russian forces bombed a maternity clinic in the war-torn Ukrainian city of Mariupol on Wednesday, they first insisted the facility was a Ukrainian military outpost and, as such, a fair target in the two-week-old, senseless war. But on Thursday, the Russian Embassy in the U.K. sought to take things one step further, tweeting out a photo of woman who has become the poster person of the atrocity—a young, blonde, heavily pregnant woman in maternity pajamas, wrapped in a dirty blanket with blood dripping down her face. The embassy tried to insinuate that the woman—who has been identified as blogger Marianna Podgurskaya, according to one of the many photographers who took her photo crawling out of the rubble, and whose open Instagram account @gixie_beauty has chronicled her pregnancy—was a crisis actor. “She actually played roles of both pregnant women on the photos,” the Russian embassy tweeted, going on to say the first photo was taken by Evgeniy Maloletka, a freelance photographer and filmmaker who has been risking his life to chronicle the Russian invasion of Ukraine since the beginning—and whom Russia considers a provocateur. The embassy neglected to mention how many other photographers, including Associated Press photographer Mstyslav Chernov, also photographed the traumatized blogger, whose life was threatened in the attack that killed three people. The Daily Beast has reached out to Podgurskaya for comment and it is unclear how her late-term pregnancy is progressing after the attack. Immediately, the darkest fringes of the internet’s conspiracy web latched onto the suggestion that a pregnant woman from Mariupol, who has an online presence and is a known blogger, would not be in a maternity hospital in the 39th week of her pregnancy. 4Chan and other deep-web cesspits have also embraced the fact that she’s famous and recognizable as a reason she couldn’t have been in a maternity ward in her hometown. “Yes, she is pregnant, but she wasn’t there of course, she’s a local beauty-blogger,” one 4Chan poster wrote. The clearly fake information is bad enough, but naming her like this is more than enough to boot the embassy's account off of the platform. As if her and her unborn child nearly dying isn't bad enough, she'll likely be harassed for years now because of this accusation. — Aric Toler (@AricToler) March 10, 2022 Hours later, Twitter removed the Russian Embassy’s tweets on Podgurskaya, telling the BBC it was “in violation of the Twitter Rules, specifically our Hateful Conduct and Abusive Behavior policies related to the denial of violent events.” Unable to control the narrative of the increasingly hostile war, Russian diplomats are going to other extreme lengths, including to fight with journalists as well. The Russian Defense ministry also ridiculously claimed the “so-called ‘airstrike’” was a “fully staged provocation” to support “anti-Russian fervor among Western audience.” And on the sidelines of the meeting in Turkey between Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, CNN correspondent Jomana Karadsheh got into a lively debate with Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova over what was reported to be doctored footage of the bombing at the maternity clinic. Karadsheh asked the spokeswoman if she had a comment about the bombing and the documented evidence of injured pregnant women and children. Zakharova called it a “fake provocation” and tried to shove her own phone with apparently doctored video into the journalist’s view.

Kakharova then went off on a tangent, accusing Western journalists of being “blind” to alleged Ukraine aggression over the last eight years. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

3/11/2022,"SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) — The former “American Idol” contestant accused of barreling into a man with his pickup truck, killing him, will remain in a South Carolina jail while toxicology results from state investigators are still pending, a judge said Thursday. Circuit Judge Daniel Hall ended the hearing without setting bond for 17-year-old Caleb Kennedy, according to news outlets. The country music singer has been charged as an adult and could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of driving under the influence resulting in death. Officials said Kennedy on Feb. 8 inhaled marijuana from a vape pen before he drove up a residential driveway and ran over Larry Duane Parris outside the workshop where the 54-year-old repaired boats in Spartanburg County. Kennedy’s lawyer, Ryan Beasley, said Thursday that his client is now on suicide watch in jail and needs to be freed or sent to an alcohol and drug treatment center, The State newspaper reported. Beasley has previously called the incident a “terrible accident"" and said his client is deeply sorry. Hall said a different judge has already ordered Kennedy to remain in jail until toxicology results are available. Hall said those results still weren’t in as of Thursday. Kennedy advanced into the Top 5 of the ABC talent show last year, but dropped out of the singing competition after a video circulated of him sitting next to someone wearing what appeared to be a Ku Klux Klan hood. Kennedy apologized at the time for the video, saying “it displayed actions that were not meant to be taken in that way.” Kennedy’s mother, Anita Guy, told news outlets that the video was filmed when Kennedy was 12 and had been taken out of context. She said Kennedy had been imitating characters from the film “The Strangers: Prey at Night.” Kennedy’s hometown is listed as Roebuck, which is just south of Spartanburg.",U.S./Associated Press,Ex-‘American Idol’ star charged in fatal crash still in jail,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-american-idol-star-charged-181435880.html
3/11/2022,"By David Lawder WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that financial sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were limiting China's ability to buy Russian oil, and Beijing was not ""meaningfully offsetting or lessening"" sanctions pressure on Moscow. ""My sense is that financial institutions in China that do business in dollars and in euros are worried about the impact of sanctions,"" Yellen said in a Washington Post Live interview. Yellen said Russia was now experiencing a ""severe"" economic contraction because of the sanctions and while she declined to offer a specific forecast for Russian output, she said in the longer term, U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors and other technologies will have a negative effect on Russian growth, ""degrading Russia's ability to project power and continue to threaten its neighbors."" The U.S. Treasury was continuing to add names of Russian elites to its sanctions and asset freeze lists, and is working with Western allies to consider further sanctions, Yellen said. But she said she would not expect most European allies to match the Biden administration's decision to ban all Russian oil imports, because they have fewer alternative sources of supply. The United States, as a net oil exporter, is less dependent on Russian energy, she said.

3/11/2022,"Russia has hit back at western sanctions for invading Ukraine by imposing export bans on a string of products until the end of 2022. The ban covers exports of telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, and electrical equipment, as well as some forestry products such as timber. The economy ministry said further measures could include restricting foreign ships from Russian ports. It said: ""These measures are a logical response to those imposed on Russia."" The ministry added that the bans on countries that have ""committed unfriendly actions"" were ""aimed at ensuring uninterrupted functioning of key sectors of the economy"". The export ban includes more than 200 products. The measures will last until the end of the year. Western governments have imposed a string of sanctions on Russia, notably on buying oil, and against billionaire oligarchs seen as close to President Vladimir Putin. About 48 countries will be affected, including the US and in the EU. The order said that export exemptions can be made for Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and for members of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the ban would include exports of goods made by foreign companies operating in Russia. Items include cars, railway carriages, and containers. It comes as Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev warned that assets owned by western companies that have pulled out of Russia could be nationalised. Firms have been leaving en masse or halting investment, including industrial and mining giants such as Caterpillar and Rio Tinto, Starbucks, Sony, Unilever and Goldman Sachs. On Wednesday, Moscow approved legislation that took the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country. And in a statement on Thursday Mr Medvedev said: ""The Russian government is already working on measures, which include bankruptcy and nationalisation of the property of foreign organisations. ""Foreign companies should understand that returning to our market will be difficult."" He accused foreign investors of creating ""panic"" for ordinary Russians who could now lose their livelihoods. According to the most recent figures, Russia is the UK's nineteenth largest trading partner, with trade between the two nations totalling £15.9bn over a year from the end of September 2020. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It's an impressive-sounding list, but how much harm will these counter-sanctions actually cause? The bulk of what western nations buy from Russia is made up of raw materials. Oil and gas, of course, but also metals like aluminium and nickel, not to mention potash and phosphates, widely used in fertilisers. The conflict has already pushed the prices of these goods sharply upwards, amid fears supplies could be disrupted - and if they remain high, that will cause economic pain, particularly in Europe. But a ban on the sale of railway cars and locomotives from Russia is unlikely to cause much hardship. Nor will restrictions on the sale of agricultural machinery, for example. These products are exported - but mainly to countries like Belarus and Kazakhstan. The inclusion of vehicles on the list is a problem for the likes of Stellantis - the owner of Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen. It had been planning to export vans made in Russia to Europe and other parts of the world. But overall, the impact of the counter-sanctions looks more symbolic than significant. Restrictions on exports of raw materials on the other hand - if Russia were to introduce them - could have a much more dramatic effect. After Britain banned Russian-operated ships from its ports last week a retaliatory proposal to restrict foreign ships from entering Russian ports could also come into force. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that there would be ""negative consequences"" for the world's food markets due to the West's sanctions because Russia is a major producer of agricultural fertilisers. ""It is clear that at such moments people's demand for certain groups of goods always increases, but we have no doubt that we will solve all these problems while working in a calm fashion,"" he said.",World/BBC,Russia hits back at Western sanctions with export bans,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-imposes-export-ban-following-130312997.html
3/11/2022,"Nick Fuentes, identified as a ""white supremacist"" in Justice Department filings, made headlines last week for hosting a white nationalist conference in Florida. His father is also half Mexican American. The big picture: Fuentes is part of a small but increasingly visible number of far-right provocateurs with Hispanic backgrounds who spread racist, antisemitic messages.

Driving the news: Cuban American Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, a group the Anti-Defamation League calls an extremist group with a violent agenda, was arrested Tuesday and charged with conspiracy in connection to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. What they're saying: Experts tell Axios far-right extremism within the Latino community stems from three sources: Hispanic Americans who identify as white; the spread of online misinformation; and lingering anti-Black, antisemitic views among U.S. Latinos that are rarely openly discussed. Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State University, said in an interview that the trend is ""part of the mutation that takes place as the racist fringe tries to become more mainstream."" Racism is deeply rooted in Latin American and Caribbean nations, where slavery was common, Tanya K. Hernández, a Fordham University law professor and author of the upcoming book, ""Racial Innocence: Unmasking Latino Anti-Black Bias,"" told Axios. ""In Latin America, white supremacy is alive and well.” Even families who have been in the U.S. for generations can often bring those biases with them. Between the lines: The U.S. trend, fueled over the course of Donald Trump's presidency and the pandemic, extends beyond movement leaders to a broader network of participants, some of whom have faced hate crimes charges. Last month, Jose Gomez III, 21, of Midland, Texas, pleaded guilty in federal court to three counts of committing a hate crime for attacking an Asian American family, including two children, he believed to be responsible for the pandemic. In 2018, Alex Michael Ramos, a Puerto Rican resident of Georgia, was sentenced by a Virginia District Court to six years in prison for his role in a beating of a Black man in Charlottesville, Virginia, following the ""Unite the Right"" rally. Christopher Rey Monzon, a Cuban American man and member of the neo-Confederate group League of the South, was arrested in 2017 for attempting to assault anti-racist protesters in Hollywood, Fla. He later resigned from the group and said he regretted using slurs for Black and Jewish people. Context: At the conference in Orlando, which made headlines because U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) accepted an invitation to speak, Fuentes drew attention for comments of his own: ""And now they’re going on about Russia and Vladimir Putin is Hitler — they say that’s not a good thing..."" He then laughed and said, ""I shouldn't have said that."" Fuentes has questioned the Holocaust, criticized interracial marriage and defended Jim Crow-era segregation. The ADL describes him as ""a white supremacist leader and podcaster who seeks to forge a white nationalist alternative to the mainstream GOP."" Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio wears a shirt supporting Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of killing George Floyd. Photo: Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images Tarrio, 38, has previously faced charges: He was sentenced to five months in jail for setting fire to a Black Lives Matter banner stolen from a historic Black church in Washington, D.C. ""I'm pretty brown, I'm Cuban. There's nothing white supremacist about me,"" Tarrio told Insider in 2020. But Tarrio was suspended from Twitter in 2019 for posting anti-immigrant threats, has denigrated transgender people and has used racist language to describe a Black actor. But, but, but: There are limits to how accepted some far-right Latino activists can become in white supremacist and neo-Nazi circles, Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the ADL's Center on Extremism, told Axios. Some extremists on 4chan and 8chan say Fuentes' Latino heritage disqualifies him from speaking on white supremacy, Pitcavage said. Meanwhile, some white supremacist elements of the Proud Boys dismiss Tarrio as a leader but so far he has withstood the criticism, said Pitcavage, who monitors the chats. Tarrio's lawyer, Lucas Dansie, did not respond to emails seeking comment. Fuentes' American First Foundation also did not respond to requests for comment.
