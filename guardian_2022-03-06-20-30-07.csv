3/6/2022,"More than 430,000 people trapped in the port city of Mariupol by encircling Russian forces are nervously preparing to evacuate after a ceasefire was announced, a day after a similar plan fell apart amid accusations that Moscow had failed to respect the agreement. Local authorities in the south-eastern Ukrainian city said an evacuation supervised by the Red Cross would begin at noon local time (10am GMT) during a nine-hour cessation in Russian attacks. Attempts to get residents out of the city failed on Saturday after Ukrainian authorities claimed the Russians reneged on an agreement to stop their shelling. The city council was forced to tell residents to return to shelters in the city. The head of the military in the Russian-controlled territory Donetsk in eastern Ukraine said safe-passage corridors for residents in the besieged city of Volnovakha would also reopen Sunday. He did not say for how long nor whether a ceasefire would accompany that evacuation. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olha Stefanishyna, said she did not trust Russia’s word but hoped that the Red Cross would step up to secure the safety of Ukrainian citizens. She said: “Hopefully, today we will manage to make the evacuation based on the agreement reached bilaterally between officials both on Ukrainian and Russian sides.” Stefanishyna added that Ukraine “knows the Russian playbook by heart” and that agreements with the Kremlin could not be guaranteed, with continued shelling overnight of hospitals, nurseries, schools and civilian homes. “This is how the reality looks, but it seems like … it does not look like [it is on] the agenda for the new wave of sanctions to be introduced by the democratic world,” she said. The British deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, also voiced his concern about the trustworthiness of the Russian assurances. “We need to be very careful for testing assurances that Vladimir Putin gives,” he said. Sunday’s evacuations were announced along with a third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine due to start on Monday at an undisclosed location. Overnight, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told US senators via video link that his country urgently needed more assistance from the US, including the establishment of a no-fly zone. A no-fly zone has been ruled out by Nato due to the inevitability of direct conflict with Russian forces. But Joe Biden’s administration is working with Poland’s government on a deal to provide Ukraine with Polish fighter jets. Under the tentative agreement, Ukraine would receive Russian-made warplanes from Warsaw, which would in turn be provided with replacement F-16s by the US. Ukrainian fighter pilots are trained to operate the Russian planes. In an address to Ukraine on Saturday night, Zelenskiy, urged citizens in cities taken over by the Russian forces to resist and spoke of his frustration at the failure of the west to come to the country’s aid. He said: “It is a special kind of heroism – to protest when your city is occupied. Ukrainians in all of our cities that the enemy has entered, go on the offensive! You should take to the streets! You should fight!” Stefanishyna, speaking to the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme, echoed her president’s frustration at the lack of military support. She said: “My president was as precise as it is possible [to be] and we absolutely support from the bottom of his, of our, hearts everything he says because this is what we feel. “It is very upsetting when the group of 30 leaders or ministers or even ambassadors are … gathering itself in a fancy cabinet, with the fancy furniture, and talking about the fancy thing, knowing that Ukraine was over this table for all of [these] years sitting in this fancy offices. “But now knowing that we can’t be there because we are operating under the bombarding of [the] Russian Federation and knowing that their intelligence also confirms that further severe attacks on the civil population – including carpet bombarding of the cities, which are basically happening these days already in some cities – will be taking place.”",News/World news,Nervous residents of Mariupol prepare to leave during second ceasefire ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/mariupol-residents-prepare-to-leave-second-ceasefire-russia-ukraine
3/6/2022,"Russia and Ukraine share much of their history. At times they have taken different paths, but never have they been at war like this – a war over history itself. Putin has denied the right of Ukraine to exist as a sovereign state. The ideas fuelling his aggression have their roots in ancient Russian myths and ideologies which I explore in my forthcoming book, The Story of Russia. It retells the Russians’ history in part through the myths and stories they have told themselves about their past. These five books have done as much as any to shape my understanding of the complex region. As Putin keeps reminding us, Russia has its origins in Kyivan Rus’, the loose medieval state founded by the Vikings on the river routes between the Baltic and the Black Sea. Nationalists in Russia and Ukraine have long competed for the right to claim the Kyivan legacy, from which both countries received their religion, written language and cultural identity as part of Europe through Byzantium. Yet as these two leading scholars show, neither “Russia” nor “Ukraine” can be traced back to this distant past so easily. The history of Kyivan Rus’ is contained in 12th-century chronicles by monks which read much like fairytales. They were foundation myths rooted in religious ideologies linking Kyiv’s foundation to God’s plan in the Book of Genesis. Deploying their sophisticated literary skills, Franklin and Shepard tease out the meanings of the chronicles’ ideas in their historical context. They draw on archaeology, birch-bark writing, art and architecture to illuminate this vibrant multi-ethnic culture based on the long-distance river trade between Europe, the Russian forest lands, and the markets of Byzantium and the Arab caliphates. Although he wrote in Russian, Gogol was Ukrainian. He sprang to fame in 1832 with this collection of Ukrainian tales told by “Rudy Panko, beekeeper”. Readers were delighted by their earthy peasant dialect and coarse humour. Ukrainian folklore became popular. The openness and freedom of the southern steppe, which Gogol pictured in these tales, stirred the Russians’ fascination with the Cossacks, the caste of brigands and mercenary soldiers who lived on the “wild lands” between Russia, Polish-ruled Ukraine and the Ottoman empire. Gogol’s next collection, Mirgorod (1835), included Taras Bulba, a hugely popular story about a Cossack and his sons who join the Zaporozhian Host in their war against Poland. This was the war that brought the Cossack Hetmanate, the “first Ukrainian state”, into union with Russia in 1654. Bulgakov was another Russian writer from Ukraine. He was born in Kyiv, where this novel is set in 1918, during the first year of the Russian civil war. The Bolsheviks have taken power in Russia; the White Guards, their enemies, have fled to Ukraine, where they hope to rally the Cossacks. And although Ukraine has declared its independence, it remains at the mercy of the German occupying troops, while Symon Petliura’s Ukrainian nationalists are camped outside the capital. The story centres on the Turbin family, remnants of the monarchist intelligentsia, whose world collapses in the chaos and confusion of the fighting around Kyiv, ending with the Soviet invasion of Ukraine. Published in 1925, the novel was dramatised as The Days of the Turbins. Stalin loved the play and saw it many times. He viewed it as a parable about a class and way of life destined for destruction by Russian might. The Ukrainians call it the Holodomor – the extermination (mor) by starvation (holod) of more than four million of their countrymen in 1932-3. Nowhere else in the USSR was the famine of those years so terrible. Four-fifths of its victims were Ukrainians – peasants stripped of all their property when Stalin’s regime forced them into the collective farms and then requisitioned their last stocks of seed and food, until they starved. Drawing on the work of Ukrainian scholars, Applebaum has given us the best account in English of Stalin’s war against Ukraine. She is sympathetic to the Ukrainian view of the famine as an act of genocide, not in the sense that Stalin sought to kill all Ukrainians, as Hitler aimed to kill the Jews, but in the sense that he intended to “physically eliminate the most active and engaged Ukrainians” in order to prevent the re-emergence of a nationalist movement led by the Ukrainian elites. This extraordinary book began as the notebook of a teenage boy, half-Russian, half-Ukrainian, who witnessed the events surrounding the Nazis’ killing of 33,771 Jews in Kyiv’s Babyn Yar ravine in September 1941. When it was published in a Soviet journal in 1966, it was heavily censored. The antisemitism of the Stalinist regime was still embedded in the Soviet cultural establishment, which saw only “Soviet” victims of the war. “There are no monuments over Babyn Yar”, as Yevtushenko wrote in his famous poem about the massacre in 1961. Kuznetsov defected to the west, smuggling out his complete text on film. A monument to the Jewish victims was finally erected by the newly independent Ukrainian government in 1991. Today, 100,000 Jews call Kyiv their home. President Zelenskiy is one of them. Putin’s missiles, in their effort to destroy the nearby TV tower, hit the monument to Babyn Yar.

3/6/2022,"One of the wildest aspects of the first Great Information War is not just that you can follow Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in real time, minute by minute and step by step, but you can also join in. Because in 2022, information is power. And one of the many huge unexpected geopolitical shifts of the last week is that this power has been returned to the people. In Russia on Friday, Vladimir Putin, a man who is now scared of his own shadow, took the extraordinary step of attempting to outlaw information. He banned Facebook. He shut down Twitter. He passed a new law that declares journalism a criminal offence: any journalist found to have published “fake news” on the war in Ukraine now faces up to 15 years in prison. It is, like so many things in the last week, incredible, unprecedented, horrifying – but more importantly it’s also desperate and absurd. Because in 2022 you can’t ban information. It’s like trying to ban oxygen. It’s the kind of move that one of his grey-faced Soviet predecessors might have made. It’s as modern and up-to-date as a typewriter. Only a fool would make predictions right now, but here’s one anyway: it proves that Putin, the founding father of what’s come to be known as “information war”, just lost the information war. Anything can and may happen. But having dominated the dark arts of disinformation for the last eight years, the Kremlin’s invincible mastery of the information space has been exposed as a sham, a fiction, another lie. Putin has put on the equivalent of a pair of bell-bottoms and is dad-dancing across the internet. Meanwhile Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy isn’t just commanding his armed forces: he’s commanding TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Telegram. He’s simultaneously available across all social media platforms – hybrid warfare’s first hybrid leader. If this sounds like wishful thinking, it is. Russia’s war on journalism and journalists, like its war on Ukraine, is unspeakably chilling. But it’s also like watching Stalin take on the TikTok kids. Meanwhile, Zelenskiy has not just put out a call for foreign fighters – anyone prepared to get on a train and pick up a gun – he’s also being assisted by a crack squad of armchair intelligence officers. Because one of the most remarkable aspects of the war so far is how anyone with a smartphone can play a role in the extraordinary Ukrainian resistance. “Osint” researchers – open source intelligence gatherers – are methodically scouring the internet for the latest photos and videos coming out of Ukraine and verifying and geolocating them in real time. Every tank is being logged. Every truck and every troop movement is tracked, registered and added to open source maps and databases. This is a country of 44 million people recording every twitch their Russian invaders make. It’s a firehose of real-time information that, with the help of this volunteer army, is being turned into real-time military strategy. On Monday, I chaired a panel with Eliot Higgins, founder of the online investigative organisation Bellingcat, who has pioneered so many of these open source techniques and whose team has been responsible for many of its most astounding feats – identifying Sergei Skripal’s poisoners, to name just one. What distinguishes this war, Higgins says, is that it’s the first time the Osint community has mobilised in real time. “It happened in Syria,” he said. “But it took time.” And in that time lag, lies, disinformation, confusion dominated. This time around, he said, the disinformation just hasn’t had the chance to take root – a result not just of this great civilian information army but of US intelligence too. It took the unprecedented step of releasing its findings to the world ahead of the invasion. It informed us that there would be fake news about fake bombs, and when there were, we watched them being debunked in real time. The world is terrible and dark, and so much of this is on us: it’s the corruption of our governments with their offshore structures and oligarch-friendly libel laws that is responsible for so much of this. That and the insanity of allowing Silicon Valley monopolies to police the platforms that provided Putin with his attack surface. All this has come back to bite Nato on its arse, and there are truly terrifying possibilities ahead. But not since 2010 and the Arab spring has it felt so acutely like technology could be the people’s friend. It’s also why we must, must, must call out the fundamental untruth that underpins this, the Kremlin’s war on truth. Russia did not invade Ukraine last week. It invaded Ukraine in 2014. And it’s not just at war with Ukraine. It’s at war with us too. In February 2014 it launched a joint military assault on Ukraine and the west. We didn’t know it then. But we do now. Because the first stage in Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was an attack on information. He distorted reality, injecting the toxin of fake news – a military strategy that he deployed against us at the exact same moment across the exact same platforms. We knew this because it’s laid out in forensic and exhaustive detail in what may be one of the most misunderstood documents of modern times: the Mueller report. We just failed to understand what it meant. But now we can and must understand, because the curtain has been lifted. Putin has been at war with us for the last eight years. A man we realised last week is the Wizard of Oz. He’s a man hiding behind a curtain, a veil of lies. A man hiding behind a curtain with a stash of nuclear warheads. We finally have the light we need to see him for who he is, to understand the war he has been waging against us in plain sight, aided by his quisling western allies – Fox News and all the chocolate soldiers of “the war on woke”. It just may be too late. There hasn’t been such a stark and universal moment of moral clarity for 82 years. This is lies versus truth. It’s darkness versus light. It’s Stalin versus the TikTok kids. But Stalin has the nukes the thermobaric weapons. He has the means and motivation to flatten not just Kyiv but the rest of us too. And what happens next is anybody’s guess.",News/World news,"Social media turn on Putin, the past master",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/social-media-turn-on-putin-the-past-master
3/6/2022,"In Los Angeles, you can easily try cochinita pibil, tamales, tlayudas and more within the span of an evening. Bring your appetite, and the city delivers. But until recently, the city lacked a formal space dedicated to exploring the rich history of such dishes. That’s changed with the opening of LA Plaza Cocina, billed as the first museum in LA dedicated to Mexican food. Calling it a “museum” alone doesn’t quite capture the mission of the space. In addition to exhibitions, LA Plaza Cocina, which opened in February, will host cooking classes, demonstrations and cultural events. For the team behind LA Plaza Cocina, the ultimate goal is expanding and highlighting people’s knowledge of Mexican cuisine. “It’s more than tacos,” says Ximena Martin, one of the curators of LA Plaza Cocina and a director at LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes. “Each region [of Mexico] needs to be celebrated and acknowledged.” LA Plaza Cocina falls under the umbrella of LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, an institution in downtown Los Angeles that has explored Mexican, Mexican-American and Latino culture and identity through exhibitions and education events since 2011. Food was often a part of those events, but staff wanted to see what would happen if they could dedicate an entire space to the study of Mexican cuisine. Martin teamed up with longtime collaborator Maite Gómez-Rejón, a food historian and creator of ArtBites, which hosts art and history-focused cooking classes and tastings, to bring the space’s first exhibition to life. LA Plaza Cocina’s first exhibition is Maize: Past, Present and Future, dedicated to an ingredient that is a staple in many Mexican dishes. The show includes cooking tools, artifacts, photographs and cookbooks, including an 1883 edition of Nuevo Cocinero Mexicano: en Forma de Diccionario, considered the oldest recipe book on Mexican cuisine. Some of the objects included are from Mixtec and Zapotec cultures or from places such as Colima, each one crucial to the process of using corn in food. Abelardo de la Peña Jr, the director of marketing and communications at LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, says that the organization first discussed the idea for the museum five years ago. There was a space set aside for the museum, he explains, as part of the partnership between LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, developer Trammell Crow Co, Los Angeles county and the Cesar Chavez Foundation. For Gómez-Rejón and Martin, the focus in this first exhibition is to explore the possibilities of having that larger venue, by weaving cooking tools and techniques alongside images and wall text. Right across from the Maize exhibition, you can see a large comal – griddle-like tool used to heat up tortillas, spices and more – which “is so essential as a way of preparing and cooking Mexican cuisine”, Martin said. The show ultimately highlights how maize became a worldwide phenomenon, even while 16th-century Spaniards tried to keep the crop from thriving. Now, maize is produced everywhere from China to Argentina to Canada. And it’s not just tortillas – there’s so much more to maize, and the exhibition highlights the tools that have been used over many generations. The pichancha, for example, is “a clay colander used during the nixtamalization process to strain the corn kernels from the nejayote (water mixed with lime)”, the exhibition explains. Overall, the space aims to work with chefs and food experts from around LA and around the world, with an emphasis on the importance of Indigenous and Afro-Mexican cuisine. “How fortunate are we as a melting pot of Los Angeles, all these immigrant folks that we have the opportunity to bring them to the forefront and give them their place and to speak their truths and show us some great cooking techniques as well,” Martin said. The next exhibition will focus on grandmothers, cooking and oral history. The museum hopes to highlight not just professional chefs but home cooks and others with a passion for food. The layout of the space makes for a richer experience, Martin and Gómez-Rejón said. Visitors can also peek at the space’s full kitchen, where cooking classes will be held. “In my regular museum classes, we would tour the exhibition and then cook,” Gómez-Rejón says. “Now, to have that [kitchen] right there, you could literally just be like ‘look over there and notice the metate or notice the pichancha’ … in all the years that I’ve been doing this, that’s not something that I’ve ever experienced.” Visitors can see the exhibitions for free, or pay a fee to attend a 16-person cooking class. They can also browse the museum’s store, LA Tiendita, which features handpicked cookbooks. The museum has also digitized materials from the inaugural exhibition, and will record and stream its workshops, creating an archive, along with recipes, accessible to those who can’t visit in person. It all comes down to a deep appreciation of Mexican cuisine, something Gómez-Rejón holds close. When asked what her favorite maize-based dish is, she replied: “I just like a good corn tortilla. If you just have really good corn, nixtamalized corn, you’re golden.”",Lifestyle/Food,‘It’s more than tacos’: LA museum explores history of Mexican cuisine,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/06/los-angeles-mexican-cuisine-museum-history
3/6/2022,"It’s 25 years since I accidentally turned a travel article for the Observer about a “romantic” weekend in Bruges into a niche journalistic genre – the misery travel memoir. The trip was scheduled a few days after my (spoiler alert!) soon-to-be-ex-husband had told me he was leaving me… and we went anyway. This tiny slice of misery-memoir histoire was entitled “By Waterloo Station I Sat Down and Wept”. While the travel-article-as-anatomy-of-a-marital-breakdown sub-genre never really caught fire, the article went off to live its best life out in the journo-sphere. After reading it, I heard subsequently, plenty of people specifically booked Suite 50 at Die Swaene hotel in Bruges. For a year or so after its publication, I documented the fallout in my weekly Observer magazine column, before being commissioned to turn it all into a book, The Heart-Shaped Bullet (Picador, 1999). After my husband was long gone and my “rebound” relationship collapsed during the writing of the book, I completely lost my own plot and ended up in a psychiatric hospital for a few weeks – the abiding memory of which is watching Dana International winning Eurovision, which, oddly enough, hurtled me back towards relative sanity. However, the story I had hoped to furnish with a happy ending had taken a different, darker turn. As its editor, Ursula Doyle, wrote in a note to me on publication, “you broke down beautifully, Kate”. Which was nice. By the turn of the century, I aimed to get the “Girl Overboard” (as the magazine column was titled) out of the lifeboat and on to dry land. When I eventually left the Observer in 2010, having been the paper’s TV critic for the previous decade (and given birth to my sons, who turn 20 and 16 this year), I liked to think I’d done that. In retrospect, in 1997 – when the nation’s collective stiff-upper-lip wobbled after the death of Princess Diana – there was barely a designated shelf of autobiographical hearts-on-tear-stained-sleeves in your local Waterstones; these days there’s likely to be an entire wall. Tonally, things have moved-on, too. The American writer Heather Havrilesky, whose Foreverland: On The Divine Tedium of Marriage has just been published, has simultaneously subverted the genre and raised the bar with her exposé of a marriage apparently still in full swing. That takes cojones. While the headline on a New York Times article about Foreverland was quite restrained (“Heather Havrilesky Compares Her Husband to a Heap of Laundry”), an example of those weirdly po-faced staccato headers favoured by US papers was the New York Post’s “Wife calls Marriage ‘insane’, hates her husband: ‘Snoring heap of meat’.” So, while I haven’t read her book, I like the sound of Havrilesky, who clearly has no qualms about both Showing and Telling. Which brings me neatly to the biggest contrast between my 1990s memoir and Heather’s 21st-century variety: the “hate mail” arrived at my Observer desk in an envelope with a stamp, densely scrawled and annotated in the margins, and occasionally in the proverbial green ink. However, these letters were far outweighed by fan mail. Far nastier to me than readers were my journalistic peers, and because the online paper was in its infancy and my column wasn’t even toddling in cyberspace, there was no below-the-line weekly monstering. Life as a misery memoirista was entirely analogue – when I was a guest on Radio 4’s Today and Woman’s Hour and (peak fame!) Richard & Judy, obviously everybody could have hated what I said but I didn’t have to hear about it. And if I read something hurtful, I’d just head off for a fag and a good cry in the stairwell of the Observer’s Farringdon Road HQ. On one memorable occasion, attempting to combine a cigarette break with discreet sobbing while reading Craig Brown’s latest Guardian column satirising my own, my colleague Andrew Rawnsley attempted to cheer me up, kindly observing that being lampooned by Craig Brown was something I would probably look back on as a career high. He was, of course, entirely correct – though arguably, at that precise moment, also a couple of decades ahead of me. These days, if you don’t like Havrilesky’s hot-button take on modern marital discord, you don’t even have to bother reading her book to have an opinion. Instead, you can simply bypass facts or rationality and make it all about you, telling her exactly what you think of her, shoutily, on the socials. Plenty do. Now, post-menopause, I could probably hack that, but I wouldn’t have coped very well with it in my early 30s. For me, that pain wasn’t performative – it was raw and real and baffling, and writing was the only way I knew how to contain it. I didn’t attempt to grandstand or even expect to be liked, I just did my best to tell the truth – “my truth” – and if anybody objected to that, I felt that it was mostly their business, not mine. Mistakes, I made a few: I gave away too much of myself, mistaking keeping firm boundaries for self-preservation as a kind of withholding of the truth. I was wrong about that; I could have looked after both myself and some of the people close to me better than I did. However, I have no major regrets. Nonetheless, the truth-telling stakes are higher now. In the 90s, being trolled meant Julie Burchill being snarky about you in a review in the Evening Standard, blushing while you read it on the Tube home. Now, for every fangirl showering a writer with empathetic broken hearts and clapping-hands emojis, there are just as many – possibly more –anonymous trolls wishing you dead. And if the release of your book had accidentally coincided with, for example, the arrival of a pandemic, or onset of an unexpected war… well, you might want to deploy the old “duck and cover” strategy. As I discovered in the late 1990s, perceptions of publicly addressed pain have a pecking order. You don’t, for example, want to be caught writing of your emotional loneliness in your marital bed while other people are being blown out of theirs by something as grotesquely physical as a missile. By 2015, in an article that corralled Rachel Cusk (whose blistering memoir of her own marital split, Aftermath, I had been in a minority of writers to review kindly) alongside Karl Ove Knausgaard, Ovid and Sylvia Plath, Blake Morrison wrote: “The confessional memoir is disreputable. Critics dismiss it as the equivalent of a selfie, a look-at-me snapshot, a glorified ego trip. Narcissism, they say, is inscribed in the very word ‘memoir’: me-moi.” However, the writer of And When Did You Last See Your Father? went on to observe that “what confessional memoirs have in common is an intimacy we don’t normally expect – the reader is given privileged access to truths the author feels impelled to disclose, awkward or painful though they might be”. This is the truth that makes a marital memoir, in particular, both compelling and capable of articulating the thoughts and feelings of those readers along for the ride. When I recently remarked on the 25th anniversary of By Waterloo Station on Facebook, a friend articulated this beautifully: “I read this column and your book as my own, similarly brief marriage was disintegrating. You summed up exactly what I was feeling. It was an unbelievable experience for me. All these years later, I am still grateful you shared your story.” Journalists largely live in the moment, never really expecting what they write to linger long in anyone’s memory – so, a quarter of a century after I sat down to meet my original deadline, it is an enormous privilege to know that By Waterloo Station… touched so many people. It certainly changed my life.

3/6/2022,"According to Don Letts, being punk rock is about “turning problems into assets”. The sensible straightforwardness of this documentary about the film-maker and DJ who is known for his work with the Clash is something of a problem. The film mostly comprises Letts, looking dapper in a jaguar-print silk shirt and bedazzled beanie, smoking as he recounts his journey chronologically. Given that its subject is such a major figure in alternative culture, it seems a waste not to tell his story in a more left-field way. Instead director William E Badgley relies on conventional talking head interviews with Letts’s countercultural colleagues, including Mick Jones, John Lydon and Soul II Soul’s Jazzie B, their memories illustrated by archive footage of Letts’s films and music videos. Thankfully, Letts is such a good storyteller that the film’s biggest issue becomes its main strength. It’s a joy to listen to him reflect on working behind the till at punk hotspots Jean Machine and Acme Attractions on Kings Road in Chelsea, or hearing James Brown’s empowerment anthem Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud for the first time. Letts gives thoughtful context to the way he was able to straddle the racially delineated worlds of dub reggae and punk rock, drawing parallels between the merging of subcultures in 1970s London, and the intersection of hip-hop and rock’n’roll in 1980s New York.",Arts/Film,Rebel Dread review – an engaging portrait of Don Letts,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/06/rebel-dread-review-an-engaging-portrait-of-don-letts
3/6/2022,"Since her country invaded Ukraine, Lydia, a 21-year-old Russian student at a university in London, has tried not to speak much on campus. She fears if fellow students hear her accent they will blame her for a war she vehemently opposes. Like many Russian students who have left the country to study here, she does not support Putin or his regime. Her friends in Russia are risking imprisonment by protesting against his war. But she worries her classmates won’t understand. When last week her lecturer talked about the invasion she “felt ashamed and wanted to disappear”. “I don’t have anyone to talk to who shares my experience. I feel isolated,” Lydia told the Observer. She surrounded herself with only English-speaking friends when she moved to the UK so she would learn the language faster, but now feels they wouldn’t understand how she is feeling. “I don’t want to burden my parents because they are already anxious enough about not being able to send me money because of the sanctions,” she said. Universities say that although their priority must be supporting their Ukrainian students, they are also reaching out to Russian students, such as Lydia, who may be feeling alone but unable to ask for help. Vivienne Stern, head of the international arm of vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, said universities are offering emotional support to “extremely distressed” Ukrainian students, as well as help with money problems, visas, and advice on trying to bring parents to the UK. But she said many are also “proactively getting in touch” with all students from Russia and Belarus to understand their situation and offer support. She added: “There have been rumours circulating suggesting that universities have been expelling Russian students. But all I have heard is universities doing the opposite and reaching out to ​understand how they may be able to help.” Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said his university is offering its Ukrainian students “as much support as we can”, but also calling every Russian and Belarusian student to check they are OK. Some were relying on roubles they can no longer access, he said. “We have a duty to all our students wherever they are from, and you can’t make students responsible for the actions of their president,” he said. Dr Olga Petri, a geography researcher from Russia based at Cambridge University, said: “There is no equivalence between the suffering of Ukrainians and what Russian students in the UK are experiencing. But it is important to remember that these students are probably cut off from their families and may be feeling very alone.” She was pleased that Cambridge’s vice-chancellor sent out a message to all staff and students last week, offering help to Ukrainians but also acknowledging that Russian students and staff would be affected too. She added: “I feel lonely and guilty. My family is safe and not under bombs, but I feel my country is going through darkness. I expect a new iron curtain will fall on Russia.” Tatiana, a Russian PhD student at Cambridge, said although her friends and supervisor have been supportive she is struggling with “the horror of war and all the uncertainty of what is going on in Russia”. She is frightened for her parents, who are currently debating whether to stay in Russia. If they don’t leave she fears the borders will close and she will be unable to see them for a long time. She said: “My parents feel a moral responsibility to protest against the war but it is very dangerous. I am protesting in Cambridge but I am safe. I don’t go out on the streets and wonder if I will be tortured or put in prison for 15 years for opposing the government.” Some Conservative MPs last week called for the children of Russian oligarchs to be banned from studying at private schools in the UK. There have been similar calls on social media for all Russian students to be expelled from universities in the UK and the US. Paul Nightingale, professor of strategy at Sussex’s University’s Science Policy Research Unit, and formerly head of special projects at the government’s Economic and Social Research Council, said all universities should “certainly be kicking out the children of oligarchs and their extended families”. But, he said: “It is stupid to say we should expel all Russian students. The ones in the UK are mostly anti-Putin.

3/6/2022,"It must have looked so simple for Vladimir Putin. Given his military superiority, a lightning strike by Russian forces would quickly overcome Ukrainian resistance and topple the regime in Kyiv. The Kremlin would have bargained for the invasion being met with sanctions, but assumed these would be a minor inconvenience given the divisions in the west. But even if the measures were tougher than expected, Russia had a huge$630bn war chest of gold and foreign exchange reserves to support the economy. The 19th-century German military strategist Helmuth von Moltke said no plan survives contact with the enemy and that was certainly true in this case. An increase in interest rates from 9.5% to 20%, the introduction of tough capital controls, the closure of the stock market and the clampdown on dissent all tell the same story: the campaign has not been the pushover Putin envisaged. The stiff resistance mounted by Ukraine was unexpected, as has been the west’s response. Russia’s economy is under siege. While the targeting of oligarchs has grabbed headlines, by far the most significant sanction has been to limit Moscow’s access to its foreign exchange reserves, there to provide a defence against an attack on the rouble. Reserves work in two ways. Firstly, they act as a deterrent, because those contemplating a speculative attack think twice if they know a central bank has the ability to slug it out. The bigger the reserves the less likely it is that a central bank will actually have to deploy them. But if the “come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough” approach doesn’t work, a central bank with deep reserves can actively intervene in the currency markets. In the case of the central bank of Russia, that would involve converting some of the $650bn into roubles. Selling dollars, euros or pounds for roubles would lead to the Russian currency going up in value. Neither of these options is now feasible. It is unclear precisely how much of the $650bn is frozen but on some estimates pretty much none of it can be used. More than two-thirds of the total – $460bn – is held in foreign currencies or securities, and largely now off-limits to Moscow. Most of the rest is in gold, which is held in vaults inside Russia. Putin could probably find someone to buy a chunk of this gold at a discount but it would be hard to convert the precious metal into ready cash quickly. As a result of sanctions, the rouble suddenly became vulnerable and it fell by around a third against the US dollar in the past week. It would have fallen still further had it not been for the emergency increase in interest rates to 20% and the introduction of capital controls designed to prevent money leaving the country. No question, this will hurt. A weaker currency will push up inflation while a doubling of borrowing costs will add to the impact of sanctions and push the economy into a deep recession. Kay Neufeld, the head of forecasting at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy says that in two years’ time the Russian economy could be 14% smaller than it would have been had the invasion of Ukraine not gone ahead. Jobs will be lost. There will be shortages of imported goods. Savings will be worth less. But as Neufeld points out, sanctions can inflict pain without leading to a change of leadership or a policy shift. Iran suffered a 20% reduction in potential output in the two years following the introduction of sanctions over its nuclear programme but didn’t buckle. So, 10 days into the invasion, the west has a big decision to make. Does it deploy the biggest economic weapon it has left: adding Russia’s oil and gas exports to the sanctions list? There are grounds for not doing this. For a start, the EU gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia and finding alternative supplies would take time. Western foreign ministers discussed an energy ban last week but are still at the stage of talking about reducing dependency on Russia rather than sanctions. The reason for hesitancy is obvious. Wholesale gas prices are already at record levels while crude oil is up by 40% since the start of the year. Western sanctions would result in oil and gas prices being higher – perhaps a lot higher – for longer. That would add to inflation and intensify an already acute squeeze on living standards. For now, western governments are putting a higher priority on freedom for Ukraine than they are on domestic pressures on their electorates, but they must now weigh up how much pain they are prepared to inflict on their own people. Putin, when he took the decision to invade, presumably took the view that ordinary people in the west did not care about Ukraine. He was wrong about that, yet even so there is a risk that “Ukraine fatigue” will set in, especially as the cost of living crisis intensifies. Ultimately the west has to decide how badly it wants to defeat Putin. If it is to do so, certain things need to happen. Sanctions will have to be extended to Russian oil and gas exports. Otherwise, Europe’s consumers will be bankrolling the Kremlin’s war machine. Finance ministries need to provide more help with energy bills, treating this crisis with the same seriousness as they did Covid-19. The transition to clean, homegrown energy must be accelerated. Last but not least, the west must not delude itself that sanctions will work quickly. It has to be ready for a long haul because even the toughest of sieges will take time to work.",News/Business,"Russia’s economy is under siege, but will the west break first?",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/russia-economy-sanctions-ukraine-west-cost-of-living-crisis
3/6/2022,"Henry V is a barometer of British views about war. In 1944, Laurence Olivier’s film was flooded with patriotic zeal; in 2003, Nicholas Hytner’s production spoke sardonically of invading Iraq. Now Max Webster finds an illuminating path through the play in his production. Never has the word “mercy” resounded so insistently in Shakespeare’s drama of conquest. In this game of thrones Kit Harington’s young king is subtle, precise, steadily growing in resolution. Passages from Henry IV are tucked in early on – the renunciation of Falstaff among them – so that his growth from lad to leader is clear. He is first glimpsed bleary after roistering; later, bewildered after his father’s death; then, newly crowned, attentively picking his way through baffling hereditary arguments at which sleekly suited courtiers groan “oh God”. This is a Henry equal in military and mental alertness. His reign unfolds as a series of decisions in which mercy and mastery are pitted against each other. He decrees that those who have plotted against him should not evade death. He approves the hanging of his old drinking buddy: the first half of the evening ends with Bardolph’s body twitching on the rope. On the battlefield he orders the killing of prisoners. His wooing of Katherine makes it clear that she is another spoil of war. First skittish and bluff, he ends in command mode. This rapture-capture is the more striking because Anoushka Lucas is a crisp, simper-free princess: she wears boxing gloves for their English lesson. This is a modern-dress production – dusty camouflage uniforms – but with no straining for contemporary parallels. It has its military sinews stiffened with the help of advice from former Royal Marines commando Tom Leigh: the soldiers jostle towards the stalls as if on an assault course. It has its blood quickened and chilled by being infused with music: a rowdy chorus of Sweet Caroline at the beginning; Purcell’s Cold Song unleashed over the stillness of the body-strewn battlefield by the marvellous bass-baritone Adam Maxey. Simultaneously action-packed and full of descriptions of unseen movements, Henry V is not easy to steer. Millicent Wong is a well-judged sardonic Chorus, but the Donmar can barely contain the bigness and busyness. Designer Fly Davis’s burnished gold screen is aptly split by a red cross made of warning lights, but ruffled by too many videos of seas and smoke and kingly features. Yet there are welcome bold innovations. The French, at court and on the battlefield, speak in French (with surtitles). Which has a triple effect: it brings a new naturalness (you don’t have to wonder why this lot are using their enemy’s tongue to talk to each other); it makes evident the gap between the two sides; it suggests an evenness of sympathy. There is no natural order, no inevitable language of victory. As the king exults at Agincourt his followers are silent, unmoving – left haggard by shock. After battle the chorus is reduced to wordless sobs. Our Generation takes the National Theatre forward. Not because Alecky Blythe’s play always comes off, but because of the possibilities it opens up. Drawing on interviews conducted over five years, Blythe uses the verbatim technique with which she created Come Out Eli, and later London Road, to deliver first-hand accounts of the lives of British teenagers. Actors repeat not only words but the coughs, hesitations, gurgles and wheezes with which they are underlined and undermined. This changes the way we listen and alters our idea of what “realism” is. Some of the accounts, delivered in fitful bursts by a wonderful, youthful cast, who slip effortlessly over the stage, are unforgettable because of desolation. At the age of 17, one girl takes up with a 22-year-old who abuses her, much as her father did her mother: as she tries to avoid describing what is happening, her face becomes streaked with mascara like prison bars. There are pungent sentences: “My nails are, like, longer than my future”; better, one boy says, to be obsessed with yourself: “You never meet anyone like yourself.” Yet most are memorable because they capture, in an exacerbated version of the adult condition, the flip-flop between the inconsequential and the crucial in daily life. There is the girl who lights up like a fruit machine with equal pleasure at the idea of hajj and Primark; the boy who is thinking of becoming a police officer because he is good at working out what goes wrong in his family; the studious lad who decides that since he does not like pain he should abandon the idea of being a wrestler and keep it as “a sideline”; the boy with parents from Kosovo who wants to be a basketball player and is seen amid his conscientious family, his limbs and syllables lolling down like used elastic bands. Some limitations of Our Generation can be explained away by deciding that its structure is simply mirroring its subjects’ personalities. The play does not so much develop as shimmy and dart, changing from minute to minute: that’s confusing, but perhaps purposefully echoes adolescent switchback moods. It is almost entirely inward-looking: of course it is – these are teenagers. Yet seeing so little of their external pressures risks highlighting eccentricity, making each individual seem without consequence and connection. Change comes as unexplained shock. In an excruciating scene, a fee-paying schoolboy is put through his paces with I Got Plenty o’ Nuttin (with accent!). In one of the show’s most shocking moments this nervous grinner and younger brother of high achievers later explains he is recovering from a nervous breakdown. Director Daniel Evans, who runs Chichester theatre, to which Our Generation will move, knows how to harmonise a stage, to make it look as if the scattered participants can naturally gather to a chorus – as they do here at the end of acts, but not throughout. At three hours 40 minutes with two intervals, this is a baggy, vivacious first draft, in need of cutting. Plenty of generating, but not quite a sense of a generation.
