1/31/2022,"An upstate New York college student died after he was exposed to extremely cold weather. Tyler Lopresti-Castro, a SUNY Oneonta student, was found unconscious Thursday morning. He was found on the ground unconscious near a bus garage in weather below zero, officials said. A 20-year-old college student in upstate New York was found dead after suffering from ""extended exposure"" to frigid temperatures last week, police said. Tyler Lopresti-Castro, a student at SUNY Oneonta, was found on the ground unconscious by university employees near a bus garage on Thursday morning at 6:50 a.m., according to a statement from the Oneonta Police Department. He was last seen around midnight Thursday. Police said he ""was apparently suffering from extended exposure to extremely cold, subzero temperatures,"" according to the statement. Otsego County Coroner Terry Knapp told ABC News it was 12 degrees below zero during that time. Castro was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, authorities said. Security footage showed no indication that Castro rode public transportation in the hours before his death, but police said he was captured emerging from a wooded area behind the garage just after 2 a.m., according to police. ""A search of the surrounding area indicates Tyler may have walked off the roadway at the eastbound off-ramp for I-88 at the intersection of Route 205, climbing through the snow and crossing a drainage creek before emerging on Oneonta City property,"" the statement said. Oneonta Police are seeking information from the public about his location between midnight and 2:15 a.m. They said he was last seen wearing jeans and a grey sweatshirt. Police added that there is no ""indication of criminality up to this point."" A SUNY Oneonta spokesperson identified him as a junior studying professional accounting and said it is ""a very said time"" for the university, according to NBC News. ""Our campus community is mourning the loss of one of our own, and we are focused on providing support to the student's family and friends,"" the spokesperson told the outlet. ""Our hearts go out to them, and we are providing whatever assistance we can to help them during this difficult time.""

1/31/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.N. report seen by Reuters says the Taliban and its allies are believed to have killed scores of former Afghan officials, security force members and people who worked with the international military contingent since the U.S.-led pullout. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ report to the U.N. Security Council paints a picture of worsening living conditions for Afghanistan’s 39 million people despite an end of combat with the Taliban's takeover in August. ""An entire complex social and economic system is shutting down,"" Guterres said. The report sounds the latest in a series of warnings the U.N. chief has issued in recent months about the humanitarian and economic crises that accelerated after the Taliban seized Kabul as the last U.S.-led foreign troops left and international donors cut critical financial aid. Guterres recommended the council approve a restructuring of the U.N. mission to deal with the situation, including the creation of a new human rights monitoring unit. The U.N. mission ""continues to receive credible allegations of killings, enforced disappearances and other violations"" against former officials, security force members and people who worked for the U.S.-led international military contingent despite a general amnesty announced by the Taliban, the report said. The mission has determined as credible reports that more than 100 of those individuals have been killed – more than two-thirds of them allegedly by the Taliban or their affiliates – since Aug. 15, it said. There also are credible allegations of the extra-judicial killings of at least 50 people suspected of belonging to the local branch of the Islamic State militant group, according to the report. ""Human rights defenders and media workers continue to come under attack, intimidation, harassment, arbitrary arrest, ill-treatment and killings,"" it said.

1/31/2022,"U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai is working to repair her relationship with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan after a Situation Room confrontation in which she accused him — in front of colleagues — of undermining her in the press, people familiar with the matter tell Axios. Why it matters: The rare window on personal clashes inside the Biden White House also illuminates the tension between the president's trade and national security advisers about how and when to execute aspects of their China strategy. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free The dispute centers more on tactics and turf, and is unlikely to derail Biden's pursuit of a digital trade deal with Indo-Pacific allies after the Trump administration scuttled Obama-era plans for a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But the heated confrontation shows how future debates can take an ad hominem turn. In a twist, Tai's chief of staff, Nora Todd, is leaving her post to start a new position Monday — on Sullivan's staff at the National Security Council. What they’re now saying: “Katherine and I are all-good — not Washington all-good — regular all-good. The only beef we deal with is beef for export,” Sullivan told Axios. Tai said: “Jake is a critical partner in delivering on the president’s vision for a worker-centered trade policy that yields results for ordinary Americans.” How we got here: During a September meeting in the Situation Room attended by Cabinet members, NSC officials and other staff, Tai accused Sullivan of leaking to the press to undermine her authority. Witnesses, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, looked stunned, sources familiar with the matter told Axios. Raimondo's office declined to comment. Stories about the confrontation, as well as broader tensions between USTR and the NSC, have since been circulating throughout the West Wing. The intrigue: Sources said Tai was outraged by stories during September in Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reporting the administration was considering investigating Chinese industrial subsidies under Section 301, which could lead to new tariffs. The reports — including an anonymous quote in The Journal that the administration “wants it to be a full-court press” — landed just as Tai’s office was wrapping up its own review of China trade policy. She assumed NSC officials had planted the stories to undermine her own review, the sources said. Her position ultimately prevailed: The administration didn't announce any 301 tariffs before she unveiled the new Biden-Harris approach to the China trade relationship during an Oct. 4 speech. USTR is a Cabinet-level position that requires Senate confirmation and carries the rank of ambassador but lives inside the Executive Office of the President. Tai, who is fluent in Mandarin, is the first Asian American person to serve in the role Go deeper: Tai, formerly chief trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee, has taken pains to involve lawmakers and labor leaders as the Biden administration recalibrates the country's trade agenda. She wants stakeholders to feel they’re shaping trade policies and processes, and avoid them feeling blindsided by any final international agreement. While her deliberative approach has been too slow for some administration officials, she retains the trust of key Democratic lawmakers. ""Ambassador Tai is an indisputably effective advocate for the Biden Administration and its priorities,"" Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, told Axios. ""Members of Congress deeply admire her expertise, her character and her commitment to supporting U.S. workers and strengthening our economy through trade policy."" AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said: ""President Biden has championed policies that put workers first. And one of the greatest success stories has been Ambassador Tai’s approach to trade."" What's at stake: A digital trade deal is an alternative to TPP and a way to show allies and partners the U.S. wants to engage in the region. The TPP initiative would have aligned approximately 40% of the global economy with the U.S., but former President Obama wasn't able to conclude negotiations or get congressional approval. Eleven of the remaining countries — from Australia to Chile — forged ahead with negotiations, and a modified version of the alliance entered into force in 2018. Last September, China applied to join the very pact designed to counter it. Like this article?
