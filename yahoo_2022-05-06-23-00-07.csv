5/6/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin will send a ""doomsday"" warning to the West when he leads celebrations on Monday marking the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, brandishing Russia's vast firepower while its forces fight on in Ukraine. Defiant in the face of deep Western isolation since he ordered the invasion of Russia's neighbour, Putin will speak on Red Square before a parade of troops, tanks, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles. A fly-past over St Basil's Cathedral will include supersonic fighters, Tu-160 strategic bombers and, for the first time since 2010, the Il-80 ""doomsday"" command plane, which would carry Russia's top brass in the event of a nuclear war, the Defence Ministry said. In that scenario, the Il-80 is designed to become the roaming command centre for the Russian president. It is packed with technology but specific details are Russian state secrets. The 69-year-old Kremlin leader has repeatedly likened the war in Ukraine to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Adolf Hitler's Nazis invaded in 1941. ""The attempt to appease the aggressor on the eve of the Great Patriotic War turned out to be a mistake that cost our people dearly,"" Putin said on Feb. 24 when he announced what he called a special military operation in Ukraine. ""We will not make such a mistake a second time, we have no right."" Putin casts the war in Ukraine as a battle to protect Russian speakers there from persecution by Nazis and to guard against what he terms the U.S. threat to Russia posed by NATO enlargement. Ukraine and the West dismiss the fascism claim as nonsense and say Putin is waging an unprovoked war of aggression. The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War Two, more than any other country, and Putin has railed in recent years at what Moscow sees as attempts in the West to revise the history of the war to belittle the Soviet victory. Beside the 1812 defeat of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, the defeat of Nazi Germany is the Russians' most revered military triumph, though both catastrophic invasions from the west left Russia deeply sensitive about its borders. SHADOW OF UKRAINE The war in Ukraine will cast a long shadow over this Victory Day. Russia's invasion has killed thousands of people and displaced nearly 10 million. It has also left Russia in the grip of tough Western sanctions, and has raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's biggest nuclear powers. Although 11,000 troops marching across Red Square along with what the Defence Ministry has said will be 131 pieces of military hardware will present a grand spectacle, the Ukraine conflict has exposed weaknesses in Russia's armed forces despite Putin's attempt in his two decades in power to halt the post-Soviet decline. The Kremlin has been denied a quick victory and the Russian economy - squeezed hard by sanctions - is facing the worst contraction since the years following the fall of the Soviet Union. Less than two decades ago, U.S. President George W. Bush joined Putin for the May 9 celebrations in Moscow. This year no Western leader was invited, the Kremlin said. The United States and its allies have ramped up supplies of weapons to Ukraine and Putin has faced calls from some in the Russian military to unleash greater firepower on Ukraine, two sources close to the armed forces told Reuters. Moscow has told the West that its arms supplies are legitimate targets. Ahead of May 9, speculation swirled across Moscow and Western capitals that Putin was preparing some sort of special announcement on Ukraine, perhaps an outright declaration of war or even a national mobilisation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed those suggestions on Wednesday, describing them as ""nonsense"". The Kremlin did not respond to requests for comment on what Putin might say in his speech, to be delivered from the Red Square tribune in front of Vladimir Lenin's Mausoleum. Last year, Putin jabbed at Western exceptionalism and what he said was the rise of neo-Nazism and Russophobia - trends he has returned to again and again when addressing the issue of Ukraine.

5/6/2022,"US Army Special Operations Command hosted its annual international sniper competition in March. The competition includes US and foreign military snipers as well as law-enforcement marksmen. Since beginning in 2004, it has become one of the best ways to test those sharpshooters' skills. Every year, sharpshooters from around the world gather in North Carolina for one of the most exclusive military sniper competitions. US Army Special Operations Command's international sniper competition brings together sniper teams from special-operations and conventional units as well as law-enforcement agencies from dozens of countries. Snipers are an essential part of every military. They can take out valuable targets at long ranges and conduct reconnaissance in hard-to-reach areas. The international sniper competition, which began in 2004, has become one of the best ways to test the skills of those marksmen. Twenty-one sniper teams took part in the annual competition's 13th iteration, traveling to the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in March. This year's version consisted of a series of events that challenged the two-man teams. The four-day event had 23 scenarios to evaluate the teams' ability to work together seamlessly as shooter and spotter with speed and accuracy against targets from multiple distances in different simulated operational environments. The events tested the snipers' long-, medium-, and short-range marksmanship capabilities using all manners of weapons, including sniper rifles, carbines, and pistols. In general, the competition aims to provide a diverse set of simulated operational conditions that reflect the realities of a modern, interactive battlefield. ""The sniper teams face lanes that force them to maneuver over and around obstacles to establish a firing position and make engagement on a target. In other lanes, they might have to be in a static position while other challenges that make it hard are presented, like targets that move behind obstacles,"" said Col. Matthew Tucker, commanding officer of the Army's 2nd Special Warfare Training Group, which hosted the competition. First place went to the US Army Special Operations Command team — the generic name may mean it was composed of members of Delta Force, a secretive unit the Army rarely acknowledges. Second place went to a team of French SAS commandos. The US Army National Guard's 20th Special Forces Group took the final spot on the podium. A team of Marine Raider sniper instructors was fourth, and a team from the Kommando Spezialkräfte, a German tier-one military special-operations unit, came in fifth. Units from across the US special-operations community participated, including almost all the Army's Green Beret units, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and SEAL Team 1. Several other countries' militaries sent teams, including Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Ireland, and Italy. In addition to the military participants, the law-enforcement contingent included a US Coast Guard team, which came in 13th, and a team from the US Secret Service, which placed 19th. This year's sniper competition was particularly relevant in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The event brought together several NATO allies and reinforced unit-level relationships. All the international teams taking part were from Europe, ""and we currently face a common threat there that harkens back to the Cold War,"" Tucker said, according to Army Times. ""So this has been a great opportunity for us, this year, to improve the interoperability that will be required of all of us to meet treaty obligations with NATO as well as with other allies."" The sniper competition is a competition, and the teams take it seriously — some more seriously than others — ""but we should remember that whoever wins doesn't mean that suddenly that is the best unit"" in the special-operations world, a retired Delta Force operator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they continue to work with the government, told Insider. ""On the flip side, that also doesn't mean that the units that come up second, third, or last are bad units,"" the retired operator added. The sniper competition offers participants the opportunity to learn from one another and for units to share their tactics, techniques, and procedures, the retired operator said. That may be one of the most important aspects of the event. ""Let's say, a sniper team for X unit might have deployed to Africa and they have mastered the marksmanship dynamics in extremely hot environments. That knowledge can be passed through such competitions and proliferate [within] the force,"" the retired operator said. Stavros Atlamazoglou is a defense journalist specializing in special operations, a Hellenic Army veteran (national service with the 575th Marine Battalion and Army HQ), and a Johns Hopkins University graduate.

5/6/2022,"In the minutes after Katie Summers hit and killed a 31-year-old moped rider, she didn’t stop to help him or call 911. She made a U-turn and parked in a nearby lot, but didn’t approach police when they arrived. Her inaction drove Benton County Superior Court Judge Alex Ekstrom to order the 31-year-old mother of two to prison for the high end of the state sentencing range — two years and two months. “Ms. Summers on the 21st of August of 2018 you killed a man. You did this through the disregard of your obligations as a driver,” he said. “You didn’t do this intentionally. You did do this recklessly, but you killed him. And when you drove away, you probably knew he was dead.” The sentence came after a morning of tearful pleas Thursday from Leo Birrueta’s family for a lengthy prison term and from Summers and her sister for leniency in front of a courtroom crowded with both families. Deputy Prosecutor Andrew Clark asked for the maximum end of the Washington state sentencing range at two years and three months. While Summers’ attorney, Brian Roach, asked for a parenting sentencing alternative which would allow her to stay with her two children or for a first-time offender waiver which would have a three month maximum. More than three years after the collision, Summers pleaded guilty in January to vehicular homicide with disregard to safety and hit and run from a crash with injuries. Video obtained by Kennewick police showed Summers drinking saké at a sushi restaurant before she drove that night, but her blood alcohol concentration at the time of the crash could not be proven because of a delay in drawing a blood sample, according to court documents filed by prosecutors. The moped’s headlights were on, and Summers had a flashing yellow arrow to yield to oncoming traffic when she made a left turn in front of Birrueta’s moped. Summers stopped a short distance away, and she paced back and forth outside her pickup. She got back in the truck and drove north on Edison, made a U-turn and parked behind the Super Supplements store in the Albertson’s parking lot near the intersection. She later told Kennewick police that she stopped and called her boyfriend instead of 911 and didn’t go over to help the dying restaurant worker. She also was seen tossing a garbage bag in a nearby dumpster. Officers retrieved the bag, which held empty containers for marijuana products along with a magazine and a business card, both with Summers’ name on them, court documents said. When police found her about 11 minutes after the crash, she smelled of alcohol but no field sobriety test was done then, according to documents. It was another four hours before a blood sample was taken to measure the alcohol and marijuana in her system. The measure found that she had a blood-alcohol level of .06%, slightly under the legal limit. While Summers’ drinking was not part of the charge, Ekstrom pointed out it as part of a set of circumstances surrounding the crash. He noted that she did not call 911 and while she was on the scene when police arrived, she did not stop and talk with them. “You valued his life less than ... your concern that your boyfriend would be angry at you regarding the condition of the interior of your truck,” Ekstrom said. Birrueta’s family and friends described the father of a young daughter as a big-hearted man who would gladly give a stranger in need the shirt off their back. His loss had left their family in shambles and his fiancée lost and his friends embittered. “My life was destroyed on Aug. 21,” his fiancée Rachel Juarez said Thursday. “We don’t know how to move on because we have such a hole in our lives.” Juarez last saw Birrueta alive as he left their home saying he would be right back. The next time she saw him it was during his funeral. After dying at 31, he had lost the chance to be a husband and have more children, she said. “He will always be my husband, my protector, my friend,” she said. “He was everything to me. He was my life.” She described the past three and a half years as a living hell, and she often finds herself passing through the Clearwater Avenue and Edison Street intersection and wondering what his last thoughts are. She admonished Summers, saying that she will get to eventually move on. And that she could have taken responsibility years ago. Elizabeth Liston described herself as Birrueta’s best friend, and said she saw the scene that night hoping her friend wasn’t involved in the crash. “I was supposed to be the person that married Leo and Rachel. I was ordained to be able to help people like Leo, that I adored, and Rachel who he adored,” she said. “And instead I had to deliver his eulogy.” While Summers’ attorney said people on social media tried to paint her as a privileged, remorseless killer, she didn’t try to run away from the scene or shirk her responsibility. At the time, Summers was fitness trainer and wellness coach with thousands of Instagram followers and had been featured in fitness magazines and websites after she lost more than 100 pounds. Roach said while she did have alcohol during her hour and 45 minutes at the restaurant, police only noted she smelled somewhat like alcohol. She also didn’t go far when she pulled away from the scene, and told people she was just moving her vehicle. “She doesn’t even get out of the view of the actual north facing intersection,” Roach argued. Summers’ sister Ashley Nelson said her sister is a good mother who fought to give birth to two children after medical problems. And the years of legal battles had left her and her partner financially and emotionally drained. Nelson said that they grieve for Birrueta and his family. “In the last few years, I have watched my sister completely dissolve under the grief of this tragic accident,” Nelson said. “She carries the pain and grief so deeply.” Summers, who spoke while crying, apologized for the pain she caused, saying the accident had brought both of their families to their knees. She said that she took the plea agreement so that the punishment would be directed toward her and not others. “I want you to know that Leo’s life matters to me, and that left turn that night is the moment that my world stopped,” she said. “The burden of this grief is one that I expect to carry every single moment forever,” she said.",U.S./Tri-City Herald,‘Hole in our lives.’ Mother who didn’t stop to help dying moped rider ordered to prison,https://news.yahoo.com/hole-lives-mother-didn-t-120000442.html
5/6/2022,"A 63-year-old grandmother was found alive on Friday, May 6, three days after she went missing while walking her dog, Texas officials say. Searchers in Houston found Sherry Noppe around 3 a.m. Friday when they heard her dog “barking deep in the woods” at George Bush Park, according to Harris County Precinct 5 Constable Ted Heap. Heap called it a “small miracle” Hoppe was found alive. “Our concern now is getting her out of the woods and to a hospital for a medical evaluation,” he said. Texas EquuSearch, which was involved in the search and rescue, said earlier in the week Hoppe “was recently diagnosed with dementia and may be very confused and disoriented.” But despite her dementia, family told KHOU she was “very familiar” with the trails at the 7,800-acre park. Her son told KTRK she did not bring her phone with her when she took her black Labrador retriever, Max, for a walk on Tuesday. Mike England, who was part of the group that found Noppe, told Katy Magazine that tracking dogs picked up her scent on Thursday. The team kept following the sound of Noppe’s dog barking until they found the missing woman early Friday. “Max absolutely saved her life,” England said. “She was huddled up, cold and scared.” Preschooler helps police find missing 65-year-old with Alzheimer’s, Arkansas cops say",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"Barking dog alerts searchers to missing 63-year-old still alive, Texas constable says",https://news.yahoo.com/barking-dog-alerts-searchers-missing-125614127.html
5/6/2022,"STORY: Civilians also suffered abuses such as ""reckless shootings and torture"" at the hands of Russian forces during their failed onslaught on Kyiv in the early stages of the invasion launched by the Kremlin on February 24, the rights group said in a report. ""The evidence we have gathered since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in late February 2022, it implicates Russian military forces in serious violations of international law, including extrajudicial killings, disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, including in densely populated areas,"" Amnesty's secretary general, Agnes Callamard, told a news conference in Kyiv. Russia, which calls its invasion a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists, denies its forces committed abuses. Kyiv and its Western backers say the fascism claim is a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression. The Amnesty report is the latest to document alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces when they occupied an area northwest of Kyiv, including the town of Bucha, where Ukrainian authorities say more than 400 civilians were killed. Moscow withdrew its troops in early April. The report concluded that Russian troops had committed a ""host of apparent war crimes"" in Bucha, including ""numerous unlawful killings,"" most of them near the intersection of Yablunska and Vodoprovidna streets. Amnesty said it had documented 22 cases of unlawful killing by Russian forces - ""most of which were apparent extrajudicial executions"" - in Bucha and nearby areas. Asked by Reuters before the Amnesty report about Russia's operation in Bucha, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The Bucha story is a set-up and a fake.""",Politics/Reuters Videos,Amnesty: evidence shows Russian war crimes,https://news.yahoo.com/amnesty-evidence-shows-russian-war-130835058.html
5/6/2022,"By Tommy Wilkes and Muvija M LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida took his appeal for foreign investment to the bankers and investors of the City of London on Thursday, saying his shift to an upgraded version of capitalism would spur economic growth. In a speech at the medieval Guildhall at the heart of Britain's financial district, Kishida set out his plan to grow the world's third-largest economy by attracting private-sector investment and redistributing wealth. Japan, like countries around the world, has been hit by rising energy, food and living costs however, and its economy is expected to have slowed to a crawl in the first quarter while the yen trades at two-decade lows to the dollar. In a world of geopolitical instability, Kishida said Japan could stand out. It has vowed to double the amount of foreign direct investment to 80 trillion yen ($617 billion), or 12% of GDP in 2030, from the current 43.5 trillion yen, and encourage firms to increase wages and spend more on research and development. ""Of course, Japan does face many challenges,"" he said. ""But I am prepared to lead reform efforts to tackle these challenges head-on. ""Sustained growth; stable markets; and safe, reliable companies, products and services. This is why Japan is a 'buy'"". Kishida, who became prime minister and won an election last autumn, had been on an extended visit to Southeast Asia before he arrived in London to address the City of London and meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Delivering his speech on the economy, he acknowledged the country faced challenges including labour shortages and said companies there needed to become more diverse. He said the government would introduce tax incentives to encourage the private sector to boost wages, and that further R&D investment was needed to hit international levels. The yen's weakness would normally be a boon for inbound travellers, but Japan, fearing COVID-19, has kept its borders closed to tourists. Once a boost to Japan's trade-reliant economy, yen weakness is also benefiting exporters to a lesser extent as many Japanese firms have shifted production overseas. The government recently upgraded its assessment of the economy for the first time in four months, citing an expected recovery in spending, but warned the outlook was clouded.

5/6/2022,"Reports of atrocities committed in Bucha, Ukraine, spiked demands for a war crimes investigation. A new Reuters report identifies soldiers and military units that were in Bucha before the retreat. One soldier was identified because his social media handle, Wolf_68, was spray-painted inside a home. A Russian soldier in Bucha while atrocities were committed left behind a straightforward clue into his identity: his Instagram handle, spray-painted on a wall inside a Ukrainian civilian's home. Reporters from Reuters spent weeks in Bucha, Ukraine, after Russian forces completed their retreat from the areas around Kyiv last month. They discovered the handle ""Wolf_68"" inside a home that a Bucha resident said had been occupied by a group of Russian soldiers. Patron is a tiny but mighty hero, helping to sniff out and defuse undetonated bombs alongside a pyrotechnic team in northern Ukraine. Kirill Kryuchkov was identified using the handle, which the outlet said he used variations of on his social media accounts. Kryuchkov, who is from Pskov, Russia, posted videos on Instagram that showed Russian soldiers in a bar drinking beer and smoking hookah on April 19. Two people who knew Kryuchkov confirmed his military unit to Reuters and another confirmed he was in Ukraine. Kryuchkov did not respond to a message from the outlet requesting comment. When Reuters contacted a friend of Kryuchkov, Vitaly Shcherbakov, he said: ""You can write: 'Fuck the Ukies'."" Reports of atrocities and potential war crimes poured out of Bucha after the Kyiv retreat, including the killing and rape of civilians as well as mass graves. Calls for an international investigation into Russia's war in Ukraine grew along with the alleged perpetrators. Reuters published its report on Thursday with new details about what happened in Bucha based on interviews with nearly 100 residents, documents left behind by Russian forces, and photo and video evidence. The outlet identified specific soldiers and military units that were in Bucha, linking some to specific acts of violence against unarmed civilians. Russia has dismissed reports about atrocities committed in Bucha, claiming the accounts are fake.

5/6/2022,"Kevin Hart raised some eyebrows on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Thursday when he said this week’s onstage attack on fellow comic Dave Chappelle “needed to happen.” (Watch the video below.) Hart said the incident, in which Chappelle was tackled during a show in Los Angeles by a man with a knife attached to a fake gun, was “not scary.” “Somebody ran on stage and got their ass kicked,” Hart said, referring to the assailant being roughed up by security. “It’s one of those things that needed to happen, though,” Hart declared. After fill-in host Mike Birbiglia voiced his objection, Hart clarified. “Mike, do you want people to continue to think that they can cross that line? ... Somebody getting their ass whipped sends a message out to the other people like, you know, ‘I was thinking about doing that, but after seeing that I don’t really wanna do that.’” Hart said it was “time to get back to a place of respect for your live entertainer.” The suspect, Isaiah Lee, 23, will not be charged with a felony, officials said Thursday.
