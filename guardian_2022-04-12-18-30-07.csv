4/12/2022,"Scott Morrison must not use trans people as “political pawns” or as a “dog-whistle to the ultraconservatives” during the election campaign, independent MPs and candidates running against moderate Liberals have said. The candidate for Goldstein, former ABC journalist Zoe Daniel, was among the independents to round on the prime minister on Tuesday, saying she was “concerned that Scott Morrison appears to be getting ready to weaponise this issue at a cost to a vulnerable community”. “Trans people are constantly used as political pawns without care – this must stop,” Daniel said. Senior government moderates Simon Birmingham and Anne Ruston declined on Tuesday to back Claire Chandler’s private senator’s bill that would permit sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex competitions. The FamilyVoice lobby group subsequently demanded that Morrison clarify the government’s position. The prime minister’s support for Chandler’s bill on Monday prompted a backlash from not only independents competing against Liberals in socially progressive electorates but some of his own MPs. Liberal backbencher Bridget Archer told Guardian Australia on Tuesday she stood by previous comments characterising Chandler’s proposal as a “vanity bill” that was not government policy. When asked about the bill on Tuesday, Birmingham said these were “sensitive issues and they should be handled sensitively”. “I understand, certainly, the concerns of women’s sporting organisations for the safety and the fairness of the competitions that they run,” the finance minister told ABC TV. “Equally, it’s important that nobody is unfairly discriminated against in terms of their rights to participate in all aspects of society including sport.” Ruston was also equivocal about Chandler’s bill. The social services minister told Sky News she supported “the conversation” and this would “enable a debate about whether there is a need for any changes”. Greg Bondar, the spokesperson of Christian lobby group FamilyVoice, said in a statement that Birmingham had “undermined the prime minister’s strong stand on the issue – aimed at winning back conservative voters who are disillusioned by the government’s failure to deliver on religious freedom”. “Birmingham needs to come to grips with reality and stop appeasing the trans minority lobby,” he said. Bondar said the government was “sending out mixed messages” about the trans sport bill. “Who do we trust, if the government can’t agree among themselves? The finance minister is contradicting the prime minister. Who is running the place?” Morrison also spoke in glowing terms about the Liberal candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves, who co-founded the Save Women’s Sport organisation, which campaigns to restrict trans women from playing in female sporting competitions. Zali Steggall, the independent MP for Warringah, said the prime minister “should be focusing on issues that the vast majority of Australians are deeply concerned about, not engineering new ways to dog-whistle to the ultraconservatives by targeting the most vulnerable in our community”. “We need to look at the motivation of Scott Morrison in raising this non-issue during the election campaign,” Steggall told Guardian Australia. “This is one of those classic Scott Morrison diversionary tactics designed to distract from his lack of policy when it comes to climate and integrity, and the media are buying in to it.” Steggall said the “self-styled Liberal moderates should make it clear that they would oppose any such legislation in the event they are re-elected, because talk is cheap”. An independent candidate for the Sydney seat of Mackellar, Sophie Scamps, said she talked with people in the electorate every day and “not a single person has raised this issue with me”. “As someone who has run for Australia and been involved in athletics all my life, I believe this is a matter for athletes and sports bodies, not politicians,” Scamps said. “I’m very disappointed that Scott Morrison has sought to make this a political issue to distract from his government’s poor record on climate action, disaster response and public health.” Kylea Tink, an independent candidate for North Sydney, said the fact the issue was being raised now in the context of an election campaign was “simply heartbreaking” and “likely to cause far more concern than constructive discussion”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Allegra Spender, the candidate for Wentworth, said the bill was unnecessary because there were already existing protections for women’s sport in the Sex Discrimination Act and in major sporting codes. “I particularly worry about how vulnerable children would be affected by this,” Spender said. The Greens senator Janet Rice raised concerns that trans children would be subjected to another “round of divisive bigotry and public debate over their mere existence”. Anna Brown, the chief executive of Equality Australia, said politicians “must learn that there is nothing to be gained by refusing to stand up for LGBTIQ+ people or using debate about our lives to score cheap political points”. Chandler has previously defended her bill, saying it would clarify “that sport and sporting activity can be operated on the basis of sex and it will not be a breach of the act to do so”. “By removing a series of complexities from the current decision-making process, sporting administrators will be able to have confidence that they are permitted by commonwealth law to offer single-sex sport for women, which in turn will provide female athletes the certainty that they won’t be forced to compete against males,” Chandler said in February. Morrison has a record of trying to sow concerns about trans issues. On 5 September 2018 – two weeks after becoming prime minister – Morrison wrote on Twitter: “We do not need ‘gender whisperers’ in our schools. Let kids be kids.” We do not need ‘gender whisperers’ in our schools. Let kids be kids. https://t.co/POzM26PXU5 In April 2019, Morrison criticised a Cricket Australia decision to release a policy that aimed to allow transgender and gender-diverse people to play the sport at the highest level and guidelines for community cricket as “heavy-handed” and “mystifying”. Teddy Cook, the vice-president of the Australian Professional Association for Trans Health, wrote in February: “Just like everyone in this country, we deserve protection under the law. Please don’t forget that trans people are not an ideology; we are real, and we are someone you know.”",News/Australia news,Independents accuse Morrison of using trans sport ban as a ‘dog-whistle to the ultraconservatives’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/independents-accuse-morrison-of-using-trans-sport-ban-as-a-dog-whistle-to-the-ultraconservatives
4/12/2022,"The federal government has sought to justify its costings for a Brisbane to Sunshine Coast rail line by releasing three heavily redacted pages from a 2019 feasibility study – a move branded “pathetic” and “embarrassing” by Queensland’s transport minister. The Morrison government claims the North Coast Connect project will cost $3.2bn and has promised half the funding. It wants the Queensland government to match its $1.6bn spend. Queensland ministers have said the project will cost significantly more and that the federal government’s figure appeared to have been “plucked out of the sky”. In an apparent attempt to respond to the criticism, the federal urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, on Tuesday released three pages of costings from a 600-page feasibility study. The pages were heavily redacted with all but six figures visible. The itemised cost breakdowns are entirely blacked out, but purport to show the 37km North Coast Connect line would cost about $2.9bn. Fletcher said the $3.2bn figure was a conservative number to cover contingencies. Fletcher said the costing was “robust” and criticised the Queensland government for questioning the figure. “In fact, the Commonwealth’s funding commitment was based on a cost estimate in the North Coast Connect detailed business case, with details from the business case released today,”he said. The federal costings come from a 2019 feasibility study that showed the project would return less than 50c in economic benefit for every dollar invested. Infrastructure Australia declined to list the proposal as a priority in 2020, based on the weak feasibility study. The Queensland transport minister, Mark Bailey, said local Sunshine Coast MPs “must have been humiliated” to watch Fletcher release the redacted document. “It is one of the most pathetic election lies ever seen by Sunshine Coast residents,” Bailey said. “Three pages! And most of the three pages are black boxes covering up information the Morrison government doesn’t want Sunshine Coast residents to ever read. “No responsible government would make a multi-billion-dollar funding commitment based on three heavily redacted pieces of paper that looks like a kindy kid’s project.” Bailey has previously said the Queensland government believes the project will cost considerably more. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said the federal announcement of funding for the project was “a rort” because there was a joint federal-state $6m planning study under way on the project. “We’ll maintain faith with that process and make a decision based on a robust assessment from that work,” Bailey said. “The Morrison government’s … announcement is another last minute, false election promise to the people of the Sunshine Coast.” Fletcher told reporters on Tuesday that the project needed to get under way quickly if it was to be built in time for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. “For this rail line to support the growth of the Sunshine Coast and to be delivered in time for the Olympics, the Queensland government needs to come to the table and commit to this project.” Fairfax MP, Ted O’Brien, accused Bailey of attempting to “sabotage” the project.",News/Australia news,Federal government criticised for ‘pathetic’ Brisbane to Sunshine Coast rail line costings document,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/federal-government-criticised-for-pathetic-brisbane-to-sunshine-coast-rail-line-costings-document
4/12/2022,"What do I wish I had known in early 2020? Other than to buy shares in toilet paper, Zoom and vaccine companies, I wish I had known that a safe and effective vaccine against severe disease and death from Covid-19 would arrive within a year – and that reinfection would nevertheless become a major issue in managing the disease. These two facts would have shifted the UK government’s response, and allowed for a more unified scientific front in advising them. At the very beginning of the pandemic, several governments – including in Sweden, Netherlands and the UK – believed the best path through this crisis was to allow a controlled spread of infections through the population, especially the young and healthy, in order to reach some static state against the virus. The idea was that “the herd” who got infected would protect a more vulnerable minority. This concept came from our approach to other vaccines, in which we inoculate the majority of children against, for example, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) in order to protect those who cannot be vaccinated due to health conditions. If Sars-CoV-2 only infected people once, or vaccinated people couldn’t catch Covid (ie if infection or vaccination resulted in lifelong immunity) then herd immunity would be possible. By now, we would have eliminated Covid completely in the richer world where seroprevalence – estimates of antibody levels – are more than 90%, and in Britain as high as 98%. However, this is far from the position we’re in. The rising number of documented reinfections, sometimes occurring relatively quickly after the initial infection, as well as the high number of infections with the Omicron variant among the fully vaccinated, means that herd immunity is likely impossible – even if seroprevalence hits 100%. Relying on herd immunity to manage Covid-19 rather than on the strategies of east Asian countries to suppress it until a vaccine was available was a gamble that Britain took early in March and unfortunately lost. Especially given the presence of variants, Sars-CoV-2 will just keep circulating and reinfecting people. It’s not all bad news, though. Vaccines have largely blunted the virus’s ability to kill, and its destructive impact on health services. However, the problem we face has shifted from mass mortality to a question of how to keep essential services and workplaces running. Covid-19 is not yet mild enough to be treated like the common cold because it makes people so ill that they cannot work. This has created widespread disruption for airlines, border control, supermarkets, schools, hospitals, police forces and even Apple stores. And it’s worth pointing out that while Omicron is milder than Delta, it is still hospitalising and killing people, especially those who are unvaccinated, the clinically vulnerable (including some for whom vaccines are ineffective), and elderly people. Waning immunity is also an ongoing concern, as is making sure boosters are provided at the right time. So governments are in a tricky situation. It’s clear that it’s better that no one is infected with this virus. Increasing evidence has been produced that shows the negative impact Covid-19 infection has on the lungs, heart and brain or even the development of diabetes. Long Covid prevalence estimates are eye-wateringly high. On the flipside, how does one avoid infection while also wanting to be part of society and mix with others? Humans are social creatures who enjoy being around other people and participating in group activities – whether dancing in nightclubs or singing in church. Asking people to restrict this for a certain period of time made sense in order to allow vaccines to be rolled out, and for clinicians to develop better protocols for treatment and understand the disease better. But now we face a variant in Omicron that is incredibly transmissible to the point that even South Korea has abandoned test and trace, and China is struggling with incredibly strict lockdowns to bring cases down. Where does this leave us? As a group of fellow scientists and I suggest in a new paper for Nature Medicine (REF), several steps can help manage this seemingly intractable situation. First, governments must use the triad of testing, therapeutics (in particular, rapid antiviral pills) and vaccines to manage Covid-19 and replace the cruder non-pharmaceutical interventions of 2020 with scientific progress. Testing is particularly important given lateral flow tests are excellent at quickly detecting infectious individuals and preventing outbreaks in workplaces. The end of free testing is a major concern in managing this disease and avoiding future lockdowns. It is better for one person to be off work isolating then be forced into work where they infect dozens of others, leading to staff shortages and preventable illness. Meanwhile, vaccines must be rolled out to all parts of the world to reach the 70% target across all countries. This will have a substantial effect in reducing the disability and deaths that Covid-19 waves cause. Second, rapid response plans must be prepared in order to react to a gamechanging new variant which could alter the trajectory of the pandemic, just as Alpha, Delta and Omicron did. This is now scientists’ main fear, and as we’ve seen, governments may only have days to pull together data and respond. Third, rapid testing to detect infectiousness and one-way masking should continue to be used to protect those most at risk of infection (healthcare workers and social care workers), as well as those most at risk of severe health outcomes (people in care homes and in vulnerable groups). Finally, long Covid hasn’t received the attention it deserves. An increasing number of people who are unable to return to work, or suffering from chronic illness, will be a major burden on healthcare services as well as the economy; and of course there is the core issue of the loss of a healthy and active life in terms of daily happiness and living free of suffering. Developing treatments for this condition is imperative given that avoiding Covid-19 infection is increasingly difficult. We must support those suffering and find ways of reducing their pain. Just as avoiding Covid-19 infection must be balanced against the importance of socialising, our response to the pandemic shouldn’t overshadow other major health issues on the horizon. These include the cost of living crisis; the number of children going hungry and living in cold, damp conditions and in poverty; the rise in child obesity and physical inactivity which has an impact on the development of chronic health issues; the mental health toll the pandemic has taken on adolescents in particular; the educational recovery needed after widespread school closures; and finally addressing the burnout of healthcare workers in the NHS. Entering the age of reinfection means Covid has truly embedded itself in our world, and it must be viewed as part of the wider picture of human wellbeing and public health.

4/12/2022,"The world of work was already quite sick before the coronavirus took hold, but the pandemic put rocket boosters on cultural change. We can see the impact of this in every metric around work: during the Great Resignation of 2021, millions of American workers resigned en masse. Workers worldwide have declared that they would quit their jobs if not provided with flexibility. The reduction in corporate property rents last year as high as 10%, with huge changes in the use of office space and co-working space. And the city has a new competitor: the suburb. The flight to suburbia during the pandemic has accounted for a rise in the property market for residences outside city centers. For downtown districts to attract and retain people as places to live and work, city centers will need to be redesigned completely. These developments come as no surprise: the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that up to a quarter of workers in advanced economies will work permanently on a hybrid basis, ie partly from home, several days a week. Discussions about RTO (returning to the office) are increasingly fraught and in flux. There is no uniform model or agreement. The case for going into an office regularly is having to be made to the workforce – and many are rejecting it. Meanwhile, CEOs have to grapple with employees who want more flexibility, the ability to work remotely and even the ability to choose their working hours – and this without a paycut. The degree of agency workers will be given – to be able to choose your place and hours of work – might well define us far more than previous classifications in the future. Being labeled a “white-collar” or a “blue-collar” worker could be replaced by being a “hybrid have” or “hybrid have-not” worker instead. In addition, up to half of America’s jobs are projected to be freelance by 2030 and two-thirds of employers now regard some form of remote work or hybrid work as “the new norm”. Many companies are declaring themselves “fully remote”, giving them a competitive edge over those requiring presenteeism. As more of us can now choose how to manage the time we spend working in a way that suits us rather than the traditional nine to five, discussions around the four-day week have reached an intensity never seen before. We are not yet anywhere near to the famous 15-hour working week John Maynard Keynes predicted in the 1930s, but his prediction seems newly relevant. People recognize that their work, and therefore their time, is a valuable commodity and they want to have a greater say in when and where they sell it. In spite of those changes, considerable ambivalence remains among some leaders. In one camp, you get the hardliners who believe working from the office is best. Many feel that those who work from home are to some extent work-shy. At the very least, they wish to penalize people who prefer to work hybrid. Take the bombastic internal memo sent by James Gorman, chair and CEO of Morgan Stanley, to his staff: “If you want to get paid New York rates, you work in New York. None of this ‘I’m in Colorado … and getting paid like I’m sitting in New York City,’” echoing an equally robust statement from David Solomon of Goldman Sachs that working from home was “an aberration”. Similarly, the veteran Wall Street observer William Cohan simply said this: “Here’s my advice to you, fellow Wall Street drones: Get back to the office.” In another camp are the more emollient hybrid softliners such as Kevin Ellis, London-based chair of consultancy firm PwC with 285,000 employees in 155 countries around the world, who said “we want to enshrine new working patterns so that they outlast the pandemic”. Regardless of which camp employers are in, it is obviously true that an awful lot of social capital resides in the office. I talked to Kevin Ellis, who said, “My worry is that we’re going to create a glass ceiling for people whose careers will be stunted because they’re working from home and not realising what they’re missing out on.” Nevertheless, all these comments reflect a wistfulness on the part of big business, which can no longer magically attract the same kind of worker prepared to work in the same way they did before the pandemic. Hybrid working reflects the fact that mobility and freedom are the new prizes for the professional working class. The shift to a placeless and timeless dimension for work means the fixed HQ will have to work a lot harder to attract and retain talent. Smart leaders today are thinking the unthinkable and asking whether they need an office in the same way again, not because they are following the hybrid herd, but because they are keeping their eyes and ears open to what is going on in their own businesses. Joanna Swash, CEO of outsourcing reception, PA and communications provider Moneypenny, was frank that her perceptions had been challenged by the pandemic when everyone had to go fully remote overnight. “Before Covid-19 I thought we’ve got amazing offices, and that they are this space that everybody loves,” she said. “What I learned was that our culture was so strong that it wasn’t just based on the office or on the physical environment, but it was based on that whole community feel, and how people trust each other. It should have been obvious to me, but that was a really big lesson at the start of the pandemic.” A similar point was made by Chris Thurling, chair of Armadillo, a digital design firm which went fully remote during the pandemic, who expanded his business during this period: “I want to remain completely open-minded about whether we ever need to have a traditional office again. If you look at the performance of our business since March 2020, we are performing really well and our clients are not saying there’s been a drop-off in quality. Our profitability as a business has gone up and we’re growing. Why would we change too much?” Bruce Daisley, an authority on the future of work and presenter of the podcast Eat Sleep Work Repeat, watches the hybrid work trend closely. He told me, “Probably the most farsighted approach I have seen was Dropbox, which said late in 2020 that getting people into the office for a certain number of days or specific days doesn’t work. Because people think, why am I going in to the office on Wednesday? Just because it’s Wednesday doesn’t make any sense. People will come in to the office when they need to and they will come into the office for experiences.” People will not come into the office, however, under duress. And if they do come, they will not stay loyal for long. In the summer of 2021, Google faced significant employee discontent when it announced that it intended to use its pay calculator to implement pay according to proximity to the office, reflecting the priority some employers still put on presenteeism. This strategy is risky and unfair, as Sarah O’Connor commented in the Financial Times: “If two workers from the same head office want to switch to working from home, but one inherited a house in an expensive city while the other had been living in a commuter town, is it fair for the latter to take a pay cut? She quoted Mark Zuckerberg of Meta telling his employees by video, “We’ll adjust salary to location … There’ll be severe ramifications for people who are not honest about this.” But who is not being honest? Some companies are clearly struggling to accept the serious shift in mindset and values of their talent. It remains to be seen whether management will rise to the challenges of supporting home-based working or continue to believe they can persuade and cajole workers to be present in the office when they don’t want to be. Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, a French broadcaster and columnist based in Paris, understands presenteeism as something else too: a feature of power politics. “The French system hates hybrid,” she said. “Because the French boss wants to know what his subordinates are doing, very micro managing most of the time. A strict hierarchy prevails. And the fact that this hierarchy actually doesn’t really work with the new ways of [hybrid] working means that innovation is slower in our country; sometimes it’s even sabotaged by people next to you who are vying with you for the boss’s attention. If this sounds like the court of a minor Borgia or Louis XIV, minus the decor, that’s where it comes from.” In the end the question, for leaders who want their people back in the office is: why? Is it because regulating some work from home – finance especially – is legally complex? Is it optics? That management and leaders feel emotionally invested in high-spec, hi-tech, visible offices? Or is it a failure to comprehend the scale and sweep of change? Mobility and work is hardwired into us – the early 20th-century office workers came, as the great Chicago poet Carl Sandburg noted in Skyscraper, from the prairies to the city, to work a fixed day and then be “poured out again back to the streets, prairies and valleys”. The city became the fixed place and so too the office. But the arrival of the internet, followed now by the pandemic, has made a new centre of work: home, and a new form of mobility: the smartphone, which can work anywhere. The future of work cannot go back in time – it can only go forwards.

4/12/2022,"The Commons Speaker has called for a “nicer and kinder politics within the chamber” in the wake of the conviction of Sir David Amess’s murderer. Lindsay Hoyle told BBC Radio 4: “I want a nicer politics. If we haven’t got democracy, what have we got?... It is about the respect of politicians, it’s building trust with our constituents. “It’s a difficult road that we’ve got to follow but it’s one we mustn’t give up on.” Conservative MP Amess was stabbed to death in October 2021 by Ali Harbi Ali, 26, who spent at least two years researching which MP to murder, fuelled by Islamic State propaganda. Ali was convicted at the Old Bailey on Monday of murder and preparing other attacks against MPs. Jurors took only 18 minutes to come to their verdict. “David would always say one thing,” said Hoyle on Radio 4, saying his thoughts were with the Amess family. “He believed and loved being an MP and nothing would stop him doing that whatever happened.” Amess died shortly after the attack at a church in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, where he had been holding an advice surgery for those from his Southend West constituency. Amess was the second MP in just over five years to be murdered by a terrorist. Labour MP Jo Cox was assassinated in 2016 by a far-right attacker. “Others like myself will carry on meeting constituents, but doing it in a very safe environment, that’s the key to us,” said Hoyle. “That’s what we were elected to do, we have a duty of care not just to ourselves, but to the staff and the people that come to see us.” While Hoyle said security was always under review to ensure MPs are safer today, he said politicians would never give into terrorism or its attempts through fear, attacks, violence and murder to stop values being upheld. In general, Hoyle said MPs of “all political persuasions” were doing a great job. He added that was about being tolerant and respectful, and not about shouting somebody down. “Let’s show a nicer and kinder politics within the chamber,” he said. Pointing to two examples, Hoyle said the Commons came together after Amess’s death, and recently when the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke to the House of Commons in a live broadcast from Kyiv last month.",News/Politics,Commons Speaker calls for ‘nicer and kinder’ politics after David Amess murder,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/commons-speaker-calls-for-kinder-and-nicer-politics-after-david-amess-lindsay-hoyle
4/12/2022,"EasyJet has said summer bookings are above pre-pandemic levels as British holidaymakers plan to flock to destinations including the Greek islands, and said it was confident despite the severe disruption and cancelled flights over the Easter holidays. The airline, which had to cancel hundreds of flights owing to high levels of Covid among its crew and understaffed airports, said it has managed mostly to stick to its schedule in the past week. It said that despite the recent severe disruption to flights in the past week it has flown 94% of the planned schedule, adding that flight volumes of about 1,500 a day were four times those of the same time last year. “This is despite the recent increase in the number of crew testing positive for Covid-19, together with normal operational disruption such as weather and air traffic control delays,” the company said. “We have proactively managed this in advance by making pre-emptive cancellations as early as possible, enabling the majority of our customers to rebook on to flights departing the same day.” Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline had experienced a “strong and sustained recovery” since the government lifted travel restrictions on 24 January. “We remain confident in our plans, which will see us reaching near 2019 flying levels for this summer and emerge as one of the winners in the recovery,” he added. The airline is expecting to report a loss of up to £565m for the six months to the end of March, lower than the £618m forecast by analysts and the £701m loss in the same period in 2021. Shares fell 2% on Tuesday morning. The company said the proportion of bookings between the UK and European Union is now back to equal. They had been skewed 70% towards the European Union because of the UK’s strict travel restrictions. It is seeing strong demand for its summer trading quarter – July to September – when it expects overall capacity to be “near 2019” levels. Capacity in the three months to the end of June is forecast to be at 90% of pre-pandemic levels, with March at 80%. “We continue to see strong demand for the fourth quarter (Jul-Sep), especially on leisure routes, where easyJet will be the biggest it has ever been,” the company said. “This has been boosted by the addition of a further five aircraft worth of slots in Greece.

4/12/2022,"China requested that a plainclothes 10-person security detail armed with pistols, rifles, two machine guns and a sniper rifle be dispatched to Solomon Islands late last year, leaked documents reveal. The Guardian has received a copy of the documents, dated 3 December 2021, in which China requested security personnel be allowed to enter the country to secure the Chinese embassy in Honiara, in the wake of the riots there in November. In a leaked memo in response to the request, also obtained by the Guardian, Solomon Islands’ permanent secretary for foreign affairs said he had “no objection” to the request from China, as the Pacific nation had not been able to guarantee the safety of Chinese embassy staff during the riots. In its diplomatic note, China said the deployment of the security team was necessary in light of “the current security situation in Solomon Islands”. “The government of the People’s Republic of China has decided to send a plainclothes security team (10 personnel) with necessary light weapons and equipment to the Chinese Embassy in Solomon Islands. The team will be responsible for internal security and necessary escort missions outside of the Chinese Embassy,” the diplomatic note said. The security team were to hold diplomatic passports and travel with the official status of “Attache of the Chinese Mission”. The diplomatic request informed Solomon Islands that Chinese personnel would be bringing with them weapons and equipment including 10 9mm pistols, 10 rifles, two machine guns and a sniper rifle, as well as other equipment including radios, satellite phones, infrared thermal cameras, 10 daggers, 10 electric batons, an electronic listening device, gas masks, and metal detectors. According to the leaked memo from Solomon Islands’ foreign ministry, permanent secretary Collin Beck said he had “no objection” to the security team’s presence in the country for a “six to twelve-month period”, though the Guardian has not been able to confirm whether or not the security team arrived in Honiara. “The request stemmed from the recent three days of from [sic] 24-26 November riots of which Solomon Islands Chinese community faced the brunt of the looting and violence amongst other business houses,” Beck wrote. Solomon Islands suffered days of rioting and violence in November, fuelled in part by anger over prime the minister, Manasseh Sogavare’s, decision to switch the country’s diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China. However, other issues, including tensions between two of the largest provinces in the country and economic hardship were also at play. Chinese-owned businesses were targeted in the riots and many buildings in the capital of Honiara’s Chinatown were burnt down. “My Ministry during the period could not guarantee the safety of the Embassy and staff. As host country we had an obligation to protect all Embassies including [the] Chinese Embassy, In this regard, we have no objection to the request,” Beck wrote in the memo. Beck added that while “sadly this sets a precedent”, that “China is a special case noting public debate was and remains directed against China’s interests in the country from certain quarters of our country’s population.” During its deployment, China offered riot equipment to Solomon Islands including 1,500 of each of the following: bulletproof vests, bulletproof armour plate, riot helmets, riot shields, stab-proof vests, electric batons, glare lights, teargas spray and first aid kits, as well as raincoats and uniforms. The Solomon Islands government confirmed the veracity of the documents in a statement issued late on Tuesday, as it cautioned the public “to be alert against fake news or misinterpreted commentaries on social media forums following leaked documents containing official correspondences between the Solomon Islands Government and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Embassy in Honiara”. “There is nothing to be concerned about,” the government statement said. Solomon Islands has been at the centre of a geopolitical storm in recent weeks after a draft security agreement between China and Solomon Islands was leaked, which outlines the process by which the Pacific country would request assistance from Chinese police, armed police, military personnel and other armed forces. According to the draft text, the agreement would allow China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”, leading to fears that China could secure a naval base less than 2,000km from Australia’s east coast. Since the draft deal leaked, Sogavare has sought to allay concerns by saying his country has no intention of allowing a Chinese naval base. He added it is “very insulting to be branded as unfit to manage our sovereign affairs”. In a sign of Canberra’s worries about the deepening security cooperation between the Solomon Islands and China, an Australian government minister was set to fly to Honiara late on Tuesday for two days of talks. The minister for international development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja, said he would raise concerns about the proposed security agreement. He said Australia had “stood strongly as a partner and a friend of Solomon Islands” for many years and believed “the Pacific family will continue to meet the security needs of our region”.",News/World news,"China requested heavily armed security team be sent to Solomon Islands, leaked documents reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/china-requested-heavily-armed-security-team-be-sent-to-solomon-islands-leaked-documents-reveal
4/12/2022,"One of the UK’s biggest accounting firms, Deloitte, is under investigation by regulators for its audits of Go-Ahead, after the bus and rail operator was embroiled in a scandal for wrongly withholding £50m of taxpayers’ money. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it had opened an investigation in relation to Deloitte’s audit of Go-Ahead’s annual financial accounts between 2016 and 2021. The government stripped the transport group of the right to run Southeastern, one of Britain’s biggest rail networks, in September for a “serious breach of trust” after discovering that £25m of taxpayers’ money had been retained by the franchise over five years from 2014. After further investigation, the full amount owed to the Department for Transport was established to be £51.3m, with discrepancies dating back to 2006. The case has been referred to the Serious Fraud Office. A spokesperson for Deloitte UK said the auditor would cooperate fully with the FRC investigation. “Deloitte is committed to the highest standards of audit quality,” the company said. Last month the Department for Transport (DfT) fined Go-Ahead £23.5m over the scandal. The group’s chief financial officer, Elodie Brian, who was the chief financial officer at Southeastern during the period where most breaches occurred, from 2014 to 2019, quit last September as the scandal emerged. The Go-Ahead chief executive, David Brown, also stepped down. Last month Govia, a joint venture led by Go-Ahead with the French firm Keolis, was awarded a new contract to run Britain’s biggest commuter rail network, a week after the DfT handed down the fine. The rail union RMT said it was a “sick joke” that Govia had been given a three-year deal to continue running the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, which started on 1 April.",News/Business,Accounting watchdog investigates Deloitte over Go-Ahead audits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/accounting-watchdog-investigates-deloitte-over-go-ahead-audits
