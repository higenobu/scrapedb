12/28/2021,"Small businesses have been forced to close during the crucial summer holiday period because of the failure of state and federal governments to bring in free Covid rapid antigen tests, the sector’s peak body says. Alexi Boyd, the chief executive of the Council of Small Businesses of Australia (Cosboa), said she welcomed an announcement by the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, that the state had ordered 20m rapid antigen tests, which he expected to be available by the end of January.  But Boyd said many hospitality and tourism businesses had already been forced to slam shut their doors due to a lack of staff amid a dramatic increase in case numbers, led by NSW, caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant. In October, Cosboa, unions and transport industry bodies called on governments to make rapid antigen tests, which deliver results within minutes, free for small businesses. “We could see with the reopening of the economy that we needed to see workers not re-entering the workforce unnecessarily and endangering people,” she said. She said the long waiting times seen at stations delivering polymerase chain reaction tests, which are more reliable than rapid antigen tests but take longer to return a result, were foreseeable at the time. “These lines at PCR testing facilities, of course they were going to happen,” she said. Speaking in Wagga Wagga on Tuesday, Perrottet said the NSW government had “put an order in for 20m rapid antigen tests”. “My expectation is they will be available by the end of January,” he said. “As we move into 2022, as we are living alongside the virus, taking personal responsibility, rapid antigen tests will be key. “They are not to be used in circumstances where you are going out to the shops. These tests will be used for people going to high-risk settings. Going to hospitals, visiting elderly relatives, going clubbing.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Boyd said Cosboa was “really pleased to see that the NSW government was taking action and showing some leadership in this regard and recognising that RATs are an important factor”. “If all governments around Australia, including the federal government, had taken some action we might have found ourselves in a different space.” The ACTU has also criticised Scott Morrison for failing to provide rapid antigen testing. Last week, the acting secretary, Liam O’Brien, said Morrison’s inaction led to “testing sites jammed and a looming crisis on our hands”. “Scott Morrison’s callous indifference to Australians who cannot afford the sky-high costs of rapid antigen tests proves yet again that working people cannot trust this prime minister to be there when they need him,” he said. Boyd said small businesses had “really risen to the challenge of keeping their workers and customers – even the not so nice ones – safe” and were now suffering from worker shortages at what for many was their high season. “For some of them, this summer period, these weeks, can be the income that they live on for months,” she said. “There’s a lot of businesses that chose to close over the Christmas period because of the low foot traffic, but more because of the risk of transmission.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app She said some business owners who remained open were burning out due to long hours caused by a shortage of workers. The Morrison government’s decision to slam Australia’s borders shut during the pandemic cut off the supply of overseas labour relied upon by some Australian businesses. “Worker shortages – that’s across the board from accounting and IT to hairdressing and retail,” Boyd said. “You’ve got worker shortages caused by border closures, you’ve got the ongoing confusion over vaccine mandates, you’ve got the problems around rapid antigen tests.” She said long waits for PCR results, which can take days to arrive, were also making life difficult for contractors who work in the concert and event industries. “They’ve been told they need to have results a certain time period before an event occurs,” she said. “That’s causing additional stress.”",News/Australia news,Lack of free Covid rapid antigen tests forces Australian small businesses to close,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/28/lack-of-free-covid-rapid-antigen-tests-forces-australian-small-businesses-to-close

12/28/2021,"It was not a long love affair; we barely made it to spring. But all through autumn and into winter, we spent every other night together. I am not good at this season. I loathe the cold, the blanched land, the flatness of a winter sky. I have to look hard for its joys and hold on to them: rook caw, sharp light on rosehip, the morning frost crowning the blackthorn.  My new love felt like one of them: I liked that he had hair the colour of a conker, and the way he wore a bright red scarf, so that, sometimes, from the corner of my eye, he looked like a haw, like sustenance. He hated winter, too. The first time I visited his house – this all happened many years ago – I found his living room filled with tropical palms and exotic corals. On rainy afternoons, we sat huddled together in pub corners, drinking Guinness and talking about the warm places we loved, about Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico; about the summer to come. We stood before Gauguin’s Bathers at Tahiti in the Courtauld, and the ancient cycads at Kew; we sat glistening in saunas; we checked in to a fancy hotel and took a long, hot bath. One weekday in midwinter, when the season had grown ridiculous in its bleakness, we made a plan: we would both take the day off and create a tropical oasis in my flat. It seemed, by that point, the only feasible way to make it through; London was miserable, the days were short, the faces looked pale and sad. It was so cold that my street stood largely empty, the shops shuttered early, and the sound of footfall ricocheted along the buildings. By the time he arrived at my front door that morning, I had already cranked up the heating and filled the house with flowers. He brought ice, tropical fruits, a small elephant’s foot palm. We spent the day in bed, drinking piña coladas and listening to João Gilberto records. It is hard for a relationship to carry between seasons. The fevered romance of summer can falter in the new lucidity of autumn; what seemed bright in March can tire come August. Ours was no different. During the months we spent together, everything felt heightened. There was the complicated relationship with the mother of his child, his growing possessiveness, the fact I did not wholly believe some of the stories he told me. Everything cast long shadows, the way it does in winter light. As spring drew closer, something seemed to shift. Perhaps, now the world had begun to feel full again, with bud and blossom and light and scent, I needed more space. One evening, after a dinner he had spent once again talking about his ex, I told him I did not feel there was enough room for me in the relationship. He shouted at me in the restaurant. He shouted at me in the street. I cried, and walked home alone. It was hard to find our way back to any warmth after that. Once, he told me that the morning after he had first stayed at mine, he sent his friend a postcard from my street, telling him he was having a lovely holiday in Bloomsbury. At first it made me laugh, and later it made me feel sad, but with time I have come to think that perhaps this was all we were ever meant to be: the warm taste of rum on a February day, the flicker of palm-shadow on unsunned skin, a brief summer fling in the depths of midwinter.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"My winter of love: We both hated the cold – so we spent the day in bed, drinking piña coladas",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/28/my-winter-of-love-day-in-bed-drinking-pina-coladas
12/28/2021,"6 January will be the first anniversary one of the most shameful days in American history. On that date in 2021, the United States Capitol was attacked by thousands of armed loyalists to Donald Trump, some intent on killing members of Congress. About 140 officers were injured. Five people died.  Even now, almost a year later, Americans remain confused and divided about the significance of what occurred. Let me offer four basic truths: For weeks before the attack, Trump urged supporters to come to Washington for a “Save America March” on 6 January, when Congress was to ceremonially count the electoral votes of Joe Biden’s win. “Big protest in DC on 6 January. Be there, will be wild!” he tweeted on 19 December. Then on 26 December: “See you in Washington DC on 6 January. Don’t miss it. Information to follow.” On 30 December: “JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!” On 1 January: “The BIG Protest Rally in Washington DC will take place at 11am on 6 January. Locational details to follow. StopTheSteal!” At a rally just before the violence, Trump repeated his falsehoods about how the election was stolen. “We will never give up,” he said. “We will never concede. It will never happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.” He told the crowd Republicans were constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back, respectful of everyone – “including bad people”. But, he said, “we’re going to have to fight much harder … We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong … We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He then told the crowd that “different rules” applied to them. “When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike [Pence] has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn’t listen to the Rinos [Republicans in Name Only] and the stupid people that he’s listening to.” Then he dispatched the crowd to the Capitol as the electoral count was about to start. The attack came immediately after. Shortly after the election, Trump summoned to the White House Republican lawmakers from Pennsylvania and Michigan, to inquire about how they might alter election results. He even called two local canvassing board officials in Wayne county, Michigan’s most populous county and one that overwhelmingly favored Biden. He asked Georgia’s Republican secretary of state to “find 11,780 votes”, according to a recording of that conversation, adding: “The people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you’ve recalculated.” He suggested that the secretary of state would be criminally prosecuted if he did not do as Trump told him: “You know what they did and you’re not reporting it. You know, that’s a criminal – that’s a criminal offense. And you know, you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That’s a big risk.” He pressed the acting US attorney general and deputy attorney general to declare the election fraudulent. When the deputy said the department had found no evidence of widespread fraud and warned that it had no power to change the outcome of the election, Trump replied: “Just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me” and his congressional allies. Trump and those allies continued to harangue the attorney general and top justice department officials nearly every day until 6 January. Trump plotted with an assistant attorney general to oust the acting attorney general and pressure lawmakers in Georgia to overturn election results. But Trump ultimately decided against it, after department leaders pledged to resign en masse. Presumably, more details of Trump’s attempted coup will emerge after the House select committee on 6 January gathers more evidence and deposes more witnesses. Trump still refuses to concede the election and continues to say it was stolen. He presides over a network of loyalists and allies who have sought to overturn the election (and erode public confidence in it) by mounting partisan state “audits” and escalating attacks on state election officials. When asked recently about the fraudulent claims and increasingly incendiary rhetoric, a Trump spokesperson said the former president “supports any patriotic American who dedicates their time and effort to exposing the rigged 2020 presidential election”. Last week, Trump announced he will be hosting a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on 6 January. “Remember,” he said, “the insurrection took place on 3 November. It was the completely unarmed protest of the rigged election that took place on 6 January.” (Reminder: they were armed.) He then referred to the House investigation: “Why isn’t the Unselect Committee of highly partisan political hacks investigating the CAUSE of the 6 January protest, which was the rigged presidential election of 2020?” He went on to castigate “Rinos”, presumably referring to his opponents within the party, such as representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who sit on the 6 January committee. “In many ways a Rino is worse than a Radical Left Democrat,” Trump said, “because you don’t know where they are coming from and you have no idea how bad they really are for our country.” He added: “The good news is there are fewer and fewer Rinos left as we elect strong patriots who love America.” Trump has endorsed a primary challenger to Cheney, while Kinzinger will leave Congress at the next election. Trump and other Republicans have also moved to punish 13 House Republicans who bucked party leadership and voted for a bipartisan infrastructure bill in November. Trump and his co-conspirators must be held accountable, of course. Hopefully, the select committee’s report will be used by the justice department in criminal prosecutions of Trump and his accomplices. But this in itself will not solve the underlying problem: a belligerent and narcissistic authoritarian has gained a powerful hold over a large portion of America. As many as 60% of Republican voters continue to believe his lies. Many remain intensely loyal. The Republican party is close to becoming a cult whose central animating idea is that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. Trump has had help, of course. Fox News hosts and Facebook groups have promoted and amplified his ravings for their own purposes. Republicans in Congress and in the states have played along. But Trump’s attempted coup could not get as far as it has without a deepening anger and despair in a substantial portion of the population that has made such Americans susceptible to his swagger and lies. It is too simplistic to attribute this anger solely to racism or xenophobia. America has harbored white supremacist and anti-immigrant sentiments since its founding. The anger Trump has channeled is more closely connected to a profound loss of identity, dignity and purpose, especially among Americans who have been left behind – without college degrees, without good jobs, in places that have been hollowed out, economically abandoned, and disdained by much of the rest of the country. Trump filled a void in a part of America that continues to yearn for a strongman who will deliver it from despair. A similar void haunts other nations where democracy is imperiled. The challenge ahead for the US as elsewhere is to fill that void with hope rather than neofascism. This is the real meaning of 6 January.

12/28/2021," From a portrait of the artist as a young man in Paris in 1886 and the artist in his mirror with a bandaged ear (from the Courtauld’s own collection), to Van Gogh’s self-portrait with a palette, painted not long before he killed himself. Featuring more than 15 works, can this really be the first ever show dedicated to his self-portraits, from every stage of his career? AS Courtauld Gallery, London, 3 February-8 May One of the most mysterious wonders of archaeology gets the blockbuster treatment. From the medieval myth that Merlin imported it from Ireland by magic to great artistic images by Blake and Constable, to the arrest of Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles at the stones, this ancient place haunts British culture. JJ British Museum, London, 17 February-17 July The studio as workshop, factory, sanctuary and theatre, and both subject and artwork in its own right. Taking us from Francis Bacon’s photogenic chaos to a Louise Bourgeois cell, from collective, collaborative spaces to places where creativity has run out, this exhibition reveals a century of art-making and aeons of frittered time. AS Whitechapel Gallery, London, 17 February-29 May It has long been Ikon director Jonathan Watkins’s dream to stage a show of Italian Renaissance painter Carlo Crivelli (1435-95), who was both a conservative figure and, Watkins says, “as radical as Magritte”. Susan Sontag saw Crivelli as “camp”. Curiosity piqued at Crivelli’s undoubted weirdness, I can’t wait. AS Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, 23 February-29 May The surrealist belief that beauty comes from the unconscious was born in Paris but kindled dreams around the globe. In Prague, it unleashed the visions of novelist Bohumil Hraba and animator Jan Švankmajer. In Mexico it inspired Frida Kahlo. Follow its flame to these and many more surreal breeding grounds. JJ Tate Modern, London, 24 February-29 August All you need is love, and in the case of this pop artist who died in 2018 that’s all a lot of us know about him. Indiana’s defining work Love is a public sculpture that swept the world, but how did he develop? Here’s a chance to see him whole. JJ Yorkshire Sculpture Park, 12 March-8 January 2023 The 19th-century painter Kawanabe Kyōsai brought Japanese art into modern times. He lived in an age of widening encounters for Japan and was a contemporary of the French impressionists, dying in 1889. His ghosts, courtesans and animals are rollicking masterpieces. This show from a great collection reveals a genius. JJ Royal Academy, London, 19 March-19 June Unpicking British colonial history is key to the work of the Guyanese-British artist, whose Armada, a flotilla of 45 votive boats, will be suspended from the ceiling of Tate Liverpool in February. Locke’s forthcoming commission for Tate Britain’s Duveen Galleries combines the themes and material that have informed his earlier work: expect trophies from the junkyard of empire, remnants and flotsam and flowers. AS Tate Britain, London, 22 March-23 October The Hepworth’s delayed show by the Paris-based American artist, who has used weaving as the basis of her work for more than 50 years, finally arrives. Drawing on wildly different weaving traditions, and working on both small woven drawings and large-scale installations that respond to the architecture of the gallery, the exhibition promises to be ravishing. A perfect venue for her art. AS Hepworth Wakefield, 7 April-25 September A great premise – get three leading artists to each nominate a younger colleague, who gets £25,000 and a show at Baltic. Culture and nature, cosmological thinking and the political and material formation of taste inform the work of Ima-Abasi Okon, Laleh Khorramian and Fernando García-Dory, selected by Otobong Nkanga, Mika Rottenberg and Hito Steyerl. AS Baltic Gateshead, 9 April-2 October Gonzalez-Foerster is an enigmatic creator of rooms, situations and beguiling surprises. Speculative, literary, haunting and strange, the French artist’s work is often as autobiographical as it is a kind of sci-fi of the self and our place in the universe. The Serpentine tells us to expect “an immersive, supernatural and sensory environment”: I haven’t a clue what to expect. AS Serpentine Gallery, London, 13 April-4 September (Dates TBC) Surrealism still lives in the transformations Parker performs on everyday stuff. Her often comical, accidental-on-purpose catastrophes, from blowing up a shed to crushing musical instruments to flattening the silverware, have helped make contemporary art popular. So this retrospective with all her greatest hits should go down a treat. JJ Tate Britain, London, 18 May-16 October Picasso gobbled up artistic influences from around the world but was also able to take on European classicism. After all, he was trained in it at a 19th-century academy. This should be thrilling as we see how he squared up to the authority of Ingres with great, strange results. JJ National Gallery, London, 3 June-9 October Working for more than 40 years as a domestic nanny in suburban Chicago, Vivian Maier had a double life as a street photographer. Her anonymity was her disguise but it was taken to such an extreme that her art remained almost unknown until after her death. Maier saw herself as a sort of spy, recording life in Chicago, New York and wherever her obligations took her. She was brilliant, weird and wonderful. AS MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, 11 June-25 September The first survey of American artist Carolee Schneemann’s (1939-2019) work in the UK, the show celebrates a radical artist and feminist agent-provocateur. Tracing her development from early paintings and assemblage, to her confrontational performances using her body as primary medium and subject, and her later films and multimedia installations. AS Barbican Art Gallery, London, 8 September-8 January 2023 The recently discovered erotic drawings of Bloomsbury artist Duncan Grant should bring the crowds to this house and gallery that preserves the spirit of the early 20th-century avant garde. Grant’s openly gay sex scenes were made at a time when homosexuality was a crime. They are his masterpieces. JJ Charleston, Sussex, 17 September -12 March 2023 Artists Monster Chetwynd and Ryan Gander are among the stars of a cultural festival across the north-east to celebrate the return of a regional wonder. The illuminated Saxon treasure the Lindisfarne Gospels, created by Northumbrian monks, is one of the most hauntingly beautiful manuscripts on Earth. And it’s coming home. JJ Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, 17 September-3 December (plus region-wide events) In a year that also includes its much-delayed Raphael blockbuster, the National Gallery dives into the world of a modern great. Freud belongs here. He judged himself against the likes of Titian, Rubens and Corot – and now his paintings can be assessed in their company. A genius takes his place in history. JJ National Gallery, London, 1 October-22 January 2023 Cézanne remains a pivotal figure in the development of modern art. Reclusive, idealistic and curmudgeonly, this new retrospective will contain many works not seen in the UK before, and follow his development from the 1850s to his death in 1906. It’s not all about apples, mountains or the bucolic Provençal good life. Tate last mounted a Cézanne retrospective in 1996. It feels a world away. AS Tate Modern, London, 6 October-12 March 2023 A hole-filled slice of Swiss cheese has landed in Budapest’s wooded City Park, forming an undulating canopy above the trees. This is the new House of Hungarian Music, by experimental Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto, designed to host concerts in a glade-like setting, along with a library and exhibitions on musical history. Budapest, January Concrete bowls bulge from the cafe ceiling of F51 in Folkestone, signalling the presence of the world’s first vertical skatepark. Billed as an “adrenaline building”, this new youth hub will house facilities for skateboarding, BMX, climbing, bouldering, boxing and more – in a building that was originally planned to be a multistorey car park. Folkestone, early 2022 The postmodern American architect John Hejduk created stories and characters more than buildings, concocting casts of strange anthropomorphic structures that took on lives of their own. This free installation will see a large-scale model constructed from one of his “masques”, built in collaboration with students from the Royal College of Art. Royal Academy, London, 22 March After almost six years, Glasgow’s cherished venue is set to reopen, following a £68m refurbishment by John McAslan. First opened in the city’s Pollok Country Park in 1983 to house the sprawling art collection of shipping magnate Sir William Burrell, the building has been radically upgraded to improve display conditions and allow more to be shown. Glasgow, March A vast oblong of glowing white marble floats above a greenish-grey stone base near the Oslo waterfront, signalling the arrival of the new £544m National Museum. Designed by German architects Kleihues + Schuwerk, it will display more than 5,000 artworks across 90 galleries, the upper Light Hall containing a colossal 2,400 sq metres space for changing exhibitions. Oslo, 11 June From a gigantic red lip-shaped sofa to a coffee table with golden bird’s feet, this exhibition will explore how surrealism has influenced design of the past 100 years, spanning kooky furniture and interiors to graphic design, fashion and photography. Anyone for an iron studded with nails?  Design Museum, London, 14 October From the 2m plastic bags being used every minute to the microplastics choking sea life in the deepest oceans, the material is everywhere. This exhibition will chart plastic’s 150-year history, explaining how we got here and asking what’s next for tackling one of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges.  V&A Dundee, 29 October What better city to host an exhibition on horror and architecture than Birmingham? Both loved and loathed for its brutalist concrete cityscape, Birmingham is the starting point for an exhibition that explores how modernist architecture – in fiction, film and art – has been used to tap into our deepest fears. Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, 25 November-19 February 2023 Providing a year-round home for the Manchester International festival, the £186m performance venue is finally due to open at the end of next year, following delays, cost escalations and redesigns. Created as a hangar-like shed, its Dutch architects OMA say it aims to “preserve the city’s rough edge, as a sort of resistance to the pervasive beautification of inner cities”. December Designed by Japanese architects Sanaa as a series of white pavilions and canopy-covered sculpture terraces cascading down the hillside site, this £184m extension promises to be a light-flooded addition to Sydney’s main art gallery. It will almost double the current exhibition space, and will include an atmospheric underground gallery in a converted second world war oil tank.

12/28/2021,"Most days I would walk along the coast road, past the bungalows facing the Channel, where the sea was implacably grey, and the gardens so neatly plotted that the space between each tulip, each daffodil, seemed to have been measured with graticule precision. Each day I would ask myself: “What am I doing here?” I had left London in the summer of 2014. Having flirted with the idea of moving to Los Angeles, instead I chose the Kent coast, then in the early flush of regeneration. I was looking for something that felt more like a community, close enough for creativity to mingle. Somewhere, perhaps, to finally feel settled.  But last spring, I returned to London – sneaking back into the city just as everyone else seemed to be heading the other way. The media then was giddy with stories of those who had escaped to the country, giving up cramped east London flats for manor houses in Somerset with enough room for chickens and rainbow chard, or moving to Thanet and taking up early morning sea-swimming. The figures seemed to back it up. At the start of this year, the accountancy firm PwC published a report predicting that about 300,000 people could leave London in 2021. The previous August, a London assembly survey was even more striking: 416,000 people planned to move out of the city in the following 12 months. There were many causes: lower international migration thanks to Brexit and the pandemic, fewer graduates moving to the capital, and the increased possibility of home working meaning the once office-bound could be pretty much anywhere. I received countless messages in those months from colleagues gleefully announcing they were emailing from their new farmhouse kitchen or in their cottage by the sea. “I don’t even miss the city!” they would say. “The kids are so happy, and we have a garden, and I can work in my tracksuit. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to the old life.” I understood. I had been a version of this too, once. I didn’t suddenly fall out of love with coastal life this year; it had been fading for some while. But this was the year I realised I absolutely had to get out. Before I vandalised my neighbours’ tulips, or walked out into the sea. It’s easy, I think, for new arrivals to cluster together, bonding over a shared choices of schools, restaurants, social events. But this in turn kindles an insularity. As more and more people moved down from London, talking, endlessly, about the fact that they had left London, some days I could barely breathe with the sheer suburbanness of it all. Everywhere hung the air of self-congratulation. It was cliquish, and gossipy, and parochial – I don’t think I’ve felt so excluded, or so sneered-at, since I was at secondary school. Meanwhile, the newcomers navigated endless squabbles, affairs, sourdough rivalries. “It has become The Archers,” a friend who still lives there told me recently. I thought about the city and all the things I missed – galleries and gigs and theatres, city parks, city trees, architecture, friends, restaurants, 24-hour grocery shops stocked with everything from za’atar to rambutan, the pace of it, the constant evolution, the sheer multicultural wonder of it all. More than anything I missed people who talked about things other than themselves. The possibility it offered. The quiet, beautiful anonymity. London might not be my city for ever, but this year it has been a joy to return – to be part of its glorious tangle again. The morning after I moved, I walked around my new neighbourhood, under the plane trees, past my new neighbours’ gardens: cherry blossom, wisteria, hollyhocks, palms; giant ferns, hydrangea, parrot tulips springing at odd angles, and finally I exhaled. At last, I thought, I have escaped back to the city.

12/28/2021,"A bright blue anthropomorphic dog may not have been the hero that dads had asked for – but he was the one they clearly needed. After years of being depicted as affable morons in children’s media – from Peppa Pig’s daddy to the accident-prone father in the interminable Biff, Chip and Kipper books – a new community of dads has formed around the children’s animated show Bluey, and more particularly Bluey’s father, Bandit.  Thousands of dads have joined an online community group launched in the UK by Matt Bellis, a Bluey superfan who wanted to connect with other fathers who loved Bandit – a dry-humoured doggy dad who demonstrates a playing prowess most parents can only aspire to. The BBC hit, which depicts the everyday life of the six-year-old blue heeler (otherwise known as an Australian cattle dog) puppy, her four-year-old sister, Bingo, and her parents, Chilli and Bandit, has been praised for making parents and children laugh in equal measure – while The Strictly Come Dancing star Tom Fletcher has called Bandit his “dad-idol”. Bandit is particularly loved by fathers because while he is not perfect – one episode shows him trying to turn watching the cricket into a game – he captures the fun many dads have playing with their kids, said Bellis. “Bandit makes you realise you need to step up your game and it helps you bond with your kids because it gives you ideas and games you hadn’t thought of before,” said Bellis, who makes steam train boilers for a living. He started the group – which is strictly for dads only – with a few friends on Facebook, but it now has more than 6,000 members from all over the world, with admins in Australia and the US. The Emmy-award-winning show, written by Joe Brumm with the production house Ludo Studio, has been showered with plaudits since it first launched in Australia in October 2018. Viewing figures are the stuff of television executive dreams, with Bluey becoming the most downloaded show in ABC iView history and the most watched preschool show for Disney in the US, as a well as a hit for CBeebies. In emails from his home in Australia, Brumm explained that Bandit was good at meeting his kids at their level. “He’s not faultless but he loves his family and would do anything for them,” he wrote. “This describes most dads I know. Given these qualities, I take great comfort in the fact that he is looked on as an icon.” Presenting the parents in Bluey as equal partners came about organically, he added: “The scripts were based on my life and I was working from home at the time. I was very involved with parenting and this just came through in the show.” But for those promoting gender equality and equal parenting that depiction is gamechanging, said Adrienne Burgess, the joint chief executive of the Fatherhood Institute, a UK thinktank. “What Bluey does differently, and what makes it revolutionary, is it shows the lived experience of dads,” she said. “Fathers are so much more engaged than they were in the day-to-day business of raising children.” While mothers did more caring during Covid lockdowns, the gender care gap narrowed. In May, the Office for National Statistics found that the first Covid lockdown led to a 58% increase in childcare undertaken by men. Bellis, who struggled with postnatal depression after the birth of his son, said the group was also a safe space for dads, where they can open up about their own mental health struggles. “I love my son to pieces, but to begin with it was difficult. I felt lost,” he said. “It can be quite lonely as a dad sometimes, so it was really important for me to have a space where we can support each other.” While fathers share photos of the memories they have created with their children, they also, he admitted, just spend a fair amount of time talking about Bluey, and of course Bandit. “I think as a show it is helping dads realise that they are just as important as mums,” he said. “It’s about co-parenting, isn’t it. You know, 50/50. You’re a team.”",Arts/Television & radio,Old dads learn new tricks from Australian children’s cartoon Bluey,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/28/old-dads-learn-new-tricks-from-australian-childrens-cartoon-bluey
12/28/2021,"Just north of the tropic of capricorn, Zimbabwe lies mostly at an altitude of between 1,000 and 2,500 metres (3,270 to 4,920ft) above sea level, which, like its northern neighbour Zambia, gives most of the country a warm and equable climate. Being farther south than Zambia, and well away from the influence of the equatorial regions, Zimbabwe has not two, but three, distinct seasons: one wet and two mostly dry.  For three months from the middle of August temperatures rise as the land becomes arid and parched. The rains come in the middle of November, causing temperatures to fall, though the increased humidity makes it feel less comfortable than before. The rains last through the summer months, but become more sporadic from mid-March onwards, through to May, when the cool season begins, bringing much-needed relief until the temperature starts to rise again in August. As in most tropical countries, the rain usually falls as thunderstorms or heavy showers in the afternoon, at the time the heat reaches its peak. The driest areas are in the south, around Kipling’s “great grey-green greasy” Limpopo River along the border with South Africa, with just 400mm (below 16in) annual rainfall. At Zimbabwe’s greatest tourist attraction, the mighty Victoria Falls, daytime temperatures remain comfortably warm all year round, though it can get surprisingly cool at night.",News/News,Weatherwatch: Zimbabwe’s warm and equable climate,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/dec/28/weatherwatch-zimbabwes-warm-and-equable-climate
12/28/2021,"Yes, we have chosen the best television of the year. Yes, we’ve celebrated how great TV can be at its finest. But where were the prank calls? The flouncing presenters? It’s time to turn our attention to the shocking, infuriating and stupid incidents that plotted the way through our television year. Here are the most controversial TV moments of 2021.  Anyone hoping Prince Harry and Meghan would maintain a diplomatic peace with the British royal family were immediately dashed when the couple sat down to talk to their neighbour and mentor Oprah Winfrey. The biggest takeaway from the event: Meghan claimed that a senior member of the family had openly wondered what skin colour their child would have. A book published this autumn pinned it on Charles, Charles has denied it and other insiders have whispered about a different culprit. Not that it matters – the impact was the thing. Another nugget from the interview: during some of the worst issues with the royals, Meghan’s mental health suffered to the extent that she contemplated killing herself. This sort of thing deserves to be treated with consideration. Piers Morgan, meanwhile, spent the whole of the next day’s Good Morning Britain angrily accusing her of lying. The day after, as the fallout continued to rumble, his weatherman colleague challenged him. He reacted by turning bright purple and storming off set. Bit snowflakey, really. In the final stages of this year’s Eurovision song contest, the lead singer of the victorious Italian entry Måneskin appeared to duck down and run his nose across the surface of a table. Social media went wild. Was he snorting cocaine? Amid Måneskin’s repeated denials, the Eurovision Broadcasting Union launched an investigation that saw them drug-test the band. And given that the tests came back negative, it would appear the Italian rockers were telling the truth. Nevertheless, good luck trying to change Twitter’s mind about anything. Perhaps the most hilariously tinpot TV launch of all time happened when GB News, ostensibly a UK Fox News equivalent, revealed that it was held together by nothing but spit and sticky tape. The graphics didn’t work. Prank callers with fake names like Mike Oxlong and Jenny Taylier (say them out loud) repeatedly made it to air. Andrew Neil looked as if he was being forcibly kept in a sex dungeon. It was awful. Has it improved? That would require watching GB News, so nobody knows. If you ever wondered how the British public would vote if they had to choose between the royal family and the BBC, here’s a pretty good indication. When Prince Philip died in April, the BBC respectfully cleared its schedules to discuss his life and the impact of his death. And people were furious. In total, the BBC received at least 110,994 complaints about their favourite shows being yanked off air. That’s more complaints than it has ever received about anything. Sure, Prince Philip was important, but you screw with The One Show at your peril. Mike's interview with Insulate Britain spokesman Cameron lasts less than a minute.@Iromg | @InsulateLove pic.twitter.com/yJS7DheACq Technically this is a radio moment rather than a TV moment, but I’m jiggered if I’m going to leave it out. In October, an Insulate Britain spokesperson appeared on TalkRadio and broke the mind of host Mike Graham. You’ve seen the clip a million times by now, but it ended with Graham claiming that concrete grows like trees, pausing for silent, befuddled seconds, shutting down the interview then grumpily stating that he never wants to talk to another carpenter in his life. The funniest, messiest brainfart that has ever happened in public. I have to admit to being slightly terrified by this, since last time this paper mentioned Line of Duty in a vaguely negative way, Jed Mercurio went full-blown bananas. However, it’s fair to say that Mercurio’s mature climax to Line of Duty – a weary, beaten sigh at the realisation that the good guys will never truly win – was met by thousands of tweets all reading “EH? IS THAT IT?” By depriving the audience of a more instantly gratifying wham-bang ending in favour of something more nuanced, the Line of Duty finale qualifies as controversial. Please don’t tweet me about this, Jed. This one, on the other hand, probably isn’t very controversial. In March, Ant Middleton was not invited back to appear on SAS: Who Dares Wins. Why? Well, who can say? Was it because he urged people to “carry on as normal” during the first wave of Covid? Was it because he called Black Lives Matter protesters “absolute scum”? Was it because multiple women filed complaints with their union, accusing him of making “lewd and suggestive” comments towards them during filming (which he claims was “military banter”)? It was one of them, given Channel 4’s response. It couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy. When Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That … was announced, one problem above all others elbowed its way to the front. Carrie Bradshaw was married to Chris Noth’s Mr Big. How are you going to make a fun TV show about dating when your lead character is married? The show devised an ingenious workaround: in the first episode, Big had a heart attack on a Peloton and died. Peloton’s stock crashed as a result, and it was forced to bring Noth back for a damage-limiting ad campaign. And then, two days later, Noth was accused of multiple sexual assaults (which he denies). It’s probably fair to say we won’t see him around again. Perhaps the most upsetting moment in all of television this year was the Euro 2020 match between Denmark and Finland. Halfway through the game, Denmark’s Christian Eriksen dropped to the ground and, while his teammates sobbed with anguish, was revived by CPR. The incident was long and traumatic, and at no point did the cameras move from the sight of a man who – as far as anyone knew – had died. The BBC eventually apologised for not cutting back to studio sooner. I mean, where to start? Gushing over the size of Kate Middleton’s waist? Describing Angela Rayner as Keir Starmer’s “best girl”? Asking the victim of a spiked drink what precautions she had taken to stop it happening? Calling a parenting expert “darling”? Ranting at a climate change activist until they left the studio? There may be more, but I got these from Googling “Richard Madeley under fire” for three seconds and it feels like enough. True, it has a lot working against it, like shrinking budgets and booming competition, but BBC One’s Christmas Day lineup was particularly lousy this year. In fact, it was so similar to 2020’s lineup that it featured the same repeat of the same Vicar of Dibley episode. The schedule demonstrates an appalling lack of imagination and worse, forced us to actually talk to our relatives.

12/28/2021,"Producers searching for a replacement for Meghan McCain as a co-host of ABC’s The View ran into criticism on Monday, over their reported preference for a conservative who does not support Donald Trump’s lie about electoral fraud or attempts to overturn the last election – but is not a “Never Trumper” either.  One critic said the news was “scary for a lot of reasons beyond leaving The View short-staffed”. Polling shows that more than half of Republicans believe Trump’s lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. That lie stoked the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January and has since driven attempts to restrict voting by Democrats and to make it easier to overturn elections. Founded by the influential journalist Barbara Walters in 1997, The View is a talkshow with an all-woman cast that screens on ABC on weekday mornings. McCain, the daughter of the late Arizona senator and Republican presidential candidate John McCain, filled the slot for a conservative voice for four years, alongside Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg and Sunny Hostin. Last summer, McCain left. She later claimed to have endured a “toxic work environment”. On Monday, Politico reported that Behar, Goldberg and Hostin were “upping the pressure to pick a successor, and voicing their displeasure at having to introduce new guest hosts … in a seemingly endless process that they find disruptive”. The website also said that while executives would not “consider a Republican who is a denier of the 2020 election results, embraced the 6 January riots, or is seen as flirting too heavily with fringe conspiracy theories or the Maga [pro-Trump] wing of the GOP”, they also wanted a host with “credibility with mainstream Republicans, many of whom still support Donald Trump”. Politico said Ana Navarro, a Republican operative and frequent guest host, was not favoured because she was too close to the other hosts – and worked for Biden in 2020. “They are really looking for a unicorn,” one “former show staffer” was quoted as saying. “They want someone who is going to fight – but not too hard, because they don’t want it to be ugly and bickering.” An anonymous guest host was quoted as saying: “The problem is that they bring people on under the mantle that ‘this woman is a conservative’ when they’re ‘Never Trump’, so they don’t represent the country.” The report prompted anger online. “I’m sorry,” wrote Tom Nichols, a Never Trump conservative, academic and author. “Why is being a Never Trumper somehow disqualifying?” Max Burns, a Democratic operative, wrote: “It’s increasingly impossible to find a prominent Republican voice willing to say the 6 January insurrection was wrong. That’s scary for a lot of reasons beyond leaving The View short-staffed.” Another writer, Daniel Kibblesmith, went further: “Maybe that’s a sign that if … the average Republican viewer is a fascist, there’s no obligation to make sure those views continue to be broadcast to millions like we’re all just friends who disagree with each other meeting in the middle.” A spokesperson for The View said: “Our plans are on track as we continue to look for the right person to join our panel of smart, dynamic women. We look forward to welcoming guest co-hosts for return appearances and introducing new names into the mix in the new year.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘Looking for a unicorn’: The View hunts for a new conservative co-host,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/28/the-view-hunts-conservative-co-host
12/28/2021,"First there was recycling, then cutting down on flights, now feeding your pets insects is the latest lifestyle choice to help tackle climate breakdown. Environmentally minded pet owners are choosing to feed their animals meals made out of crickets, mealworms and black soldier flies in an attempt to curb the huge carbon emissions produced by raising livestock for traditional, meat-based diets.  Experts say pets can be fed insects as they are rich in protein, and that farmed species can also contain high fats, oils, mineral and vitamin levels. Preliminary research also suggests that when insects are farmed commercially, emissions, water, and land usage is lower than farming livestock. Nicole Paley, deputy chief executive of the Pet Food Manufacturers Association, said: “When made into a nutritionally complete pet food, insect proteins can contribute to nutritious and palatable products that can also be environmentally sustainable. Insect-based products offer an alternative for owners who prefer to feed their pets a diet that is sourced from ingredients other than traditional livestock animals.” Forecasts by Rabobank, a Dutch multinational, estimate that the insect-based pet food market could increase 50-fold by 2030, when half a million metric tons are projected to be produced. Andrew Knight, a professor of veterinary science at the University of Winchester, said this would reflect growing consumer interest in alternative pet foods, which included vegan diets, for sustainability reasons.This is partly a result of owners’ anxieties about the high carbon footprint associated with the pet food industry, which according to a UCLA study represents about 25% of the environmental damage associated with the meat industry, and is equivalent to 64m tons of carbon dioxide a year – the same climate impact as 13.6m cars driving for a year. However, Knight added that many consumers’ “revulsion to insect-based diets” may act as a barrier to wider take up.Insect-based pet food is also typically more expensive than traditional ranges. For example, a bag of insect-based Lovefood dry kibble costs £12 a kg, compared with £9.75 for a 2kg bag of Iams dry cat food with chicken.Solitaire Townsend, co-founder of Futerra, which is working with Mars Petcare to produce Lovebug, its first insect-based pet food range for cats, said their market research suggested that nearly half (47%) of pet owners would consider feeding their pets insects, with 87% of those surveyed noting that sustainability was an important consideration in choosing pet food. Townsend said that as a vegetarian for climate reasons, she wanted an option “for my cat and my conscience”. She added: “Cats aren’t squeamish about eating bugs, but some people can be. Of course, millions of people across the world eat insects as normal within their diet. Perhaps in the UK it can feel a bit unusual, but I’m old enough to remember when sushi, and even pasta, was the same way.”She said owners should be aware that pets could be sensitive to sudden changes in their diet, and recommended a week-long transition, starting with a ratio of 75% old food to 25% new food and slowly altering the balance.Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, said owners must be careful to ensure that insect-based pet food met their pets’ nutritional needs, and further research was needed. “At the moment, there is not enough evidence to support insect-based protein completely replacing current complete pet food diets, but it is another option which could be considered in the future. Owners should always ensure any changes to a pet’s diet are supervised by a vet with in-depth nutritional knowledge,” she said. According to the Pet Food Manufacturers Association, there are seven insects authorised by the EU for use as pet food ingredients. The farmed insects are fed on spent grains, palm kernel, fruits and vegetable crop by-products, and while most farms were originally located in the tropics there are now more than 100 in Europe.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Why feeding your pets insects could become all the buzz,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/28/why-feeding-your-pets-insects-could-become-all-the-buzz
12/28/2021,"Former England cricketers and fans have begun what promises to be a long and painful postmortem into how the team slumped to the quickest ever Ashes series defeat in Australia after only 12 days of cricket. England legend Ian Botham said he was “embarrassed” after they capitulated to defeat by an innings and 14 runs on the third day of the Third test in Melbourne on Tuesday morning with only their captain Joe Root – as usual on this tour – showing any application with the bat.  Australia retains the urn inside 12 days. England spent longer quarantining on the Gold Coast. #Ashes Already 2-0 down in the five-match series, they needed a big score in the second innings to have any hope of fighting back but slumped to 68 all out – their lowest total in Australia for 117 years. Australia wrapped up the Ashes in 852.3 overs from the first Test to the end of the third, the quickest of any side for a five-Test series Ashes Down Under. England are well on their way to another 5-0 series whitewash to match those suffered in 2006-07 and 2013-14, with the remaining two Tests to come in Sydney and Hobart. However, the consensus among ex-players, commentators and fans was that the class of 2021-22 is one of the worst, if not the worst, ever sent to contest the Ashes in Australia. “I’m a little embarrassed,” Botham told the Seven Network in Australia. “To lose the Ashes in 12 days, I don’t know if that’s the fastest, but it’s got to be very close to it. “I just think that England have lost their way.” Steve Harmison, whose fast bowling feats helped England to win the Ashes in 2005, also said he was embarrassed and that it would be a difficult inquest process. “That’s embarrassing, I’m sorry,” he said in the wake of the defeat. “There’s going to be a big inquest, there’s going to be people’s careers on the line”.

Well done Australia .. Far too good for England .. #Ashes @FoxCricket The television presenter and cricket fan Piers Morgan said the defeat occurred in the “most humiliating manner imaginable”, adding: “I feel sick”. England all out 68 - and the Ashes are gone in the most humiliating manner imaginable.Congrats to Australia on being way too good for us, and to Scotty Boland - who I’d never heard of a week ago! - on one of the all-time great Ashes bowling performances.I feel sick. pic.twitter.com/aY6oUC27g2 Morgan admitted that he, like many England fans, had never heard of the Australian bowler Scott Boland before he ripped through England’s batting in Melbourne, finishing up with six wickets for seven runs. His efforts contributed to England recording another set of ducks and now have a world record 54 for the calendar year. England fans had their say in emails to the Guardian’s over-by-over blog. Lawrence Di Bartolo, of Brisbane, who described himself as an ex England cricket team supporter, said his worst fears about the outcome of the tour had come true, and summed up the mood of many. “This tour has been a train wreck waiting to happen,” he wrote. “Unfortunately such is the pathetic state of English cricket that it will be glossed over and normal transmission will resume with the same losers in charge of the wreckage that is English cricket. Until someone stands up and states that this is not good enough English cricket will continue to be the laughing stock of the cricket world and kids will not want to play a sport full of gutless losers.” Another England fan, Tom Paternoster-Howe, was searching for silver linings. “The only good thing about how pathetic and embarrassing this shower that passes for an international test team are, is that at least their incompetence will annoy 140,000 Australians who had tickets for the last 2 days.”",Sport/Sport,‘Embarrassing’: ex-players and fans lament England’s Ashes defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/28/embarrassing-ex-players-and-fans-lament-englands-ashes-defeat
12/28/2021,"Exhausted New South Wales health workers are being pressured to return from Christmas leave as hospitals and testing facilities are crippled by surging Covid numbers and staff furloughs. About 2,000 health workers have been furloughed across the state after being listed as close contacts, prompting NSW Health to slash the isolation time for health workers from two weeks to seven days provided they return a negative PCR test.  Health Services Union secretary Gerard Hayes welcomed the change but said immense stress was being placed on a hospital system at breaking point and workers were now under pressure to return from leave. “We’re seeing all these additional pressures … the ambulance service fast tracking students out of university, hospital workers returning from leave, and 200 people on permanent casual shifts for 12 months just trying to get through this period,” he said. Hayes said the next four weeks would be the ultimate test on the health system. “When you have 2,000 people off on a daily basis that is ultimately not sustainable,” he said. “We have some breathing space as vaccines appear to be working, and presentations are nowhere near as big as they were. “But we’re seeing 6,000 cases a day and probably more. If that presentation rate increases it would be incredibly problematic.” Covid hospitalisations have more than tripled in the past fortnight, rising to 557 on 28 December including 60 people in ICU. “Take on the frustration of 18 months work, of chronic fatigue and then the frustration of missing Christmas, and New Year, all these additional pressures are stacking up,” Hayes said. “We are really pushing hard to allow people to have leave because a lot hasn’t been taken … people are fatigued. If they keep pushing on that could have long-term effects. People might start leaving the industry because it’s all becoming too much.” NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association general secretary Brett Holmes said the system was under “enormous pressure” with “massive and ongoing shortages” on rosters. “Even without furloughed staff, everywhere is extremely tight,” he said. “We know many nurses have been asked to voluntarily cancel leave, and we have an exhausted workforce given the intensity of the past 18 months.” “There are no easy solutions here, we have a long term problem for the proper staffing of hospitals, and other issues will continue to arise,” he said. Meanwhile, the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard on Tuesday said staff across the state were “exhausted”, with some laboratories working through the night to process Covid-19 test results. Hazzard said he was “very concerned” about two St Vincent’s Hospital bungles that led to about 1,400 people falsely receive negative Covid test results when they were positive or meant to be isolating. Of those, 886 people who were told they were negative have turned out to be positive. In a statement, SydPath, the laboratory responsible for processing the tests, said that to deal with the “major increase” in test volumes it had moved from an automated to a manual system to expedite the release of negative test results. Hazzard said he had made sure the hospital had reviewed its protocol and procedures but “when people are under pressure, human errors become more frequent”. “There just isn’t the capacity anymore … particularly when some of those queues [for testing] are three and four kilometres long,” he said.",News/Australia news,NSW health staff pressured to return from Christmas leave as Covid cripples hospitals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/28/nsw-health-staff-pressured-to-return-from-leave-as-covid-cripples-hospitals
12/28/2021,"At this darkest, coldest time of the year, it seems a kind of midwinter madness to take a canoe on to a Highland loch in the deep of night. But we came here for the summer solstice, so it feels right to return. We are the Swallow, set for adventure. The moon is full, but muted by a thick mist. As we cut across the loch, the black water fades without seam into grey cloud, all the familiar landmarks on the shore dissolving. The silence is broken only by the slap of paddles and the creak of boat until unseen geese are startled. Their rising hullabaloo erupts into a storm of wingbeats and splashing till they circle above and settle again, squawks fading. We make for the dark island, feeling like the Dawn Treader on the brink of nightmares, then judder across a skirt of ice that cracks and splinters beneath us. Now we are the Endurance at the ends of the earth. Our vessel stowed on the frosted shore, we head for a clearing at the foot of giant beeches, sweep away leaves and dig out a circle of turf for a fire. Flasks appear, bowls of warm custard on cake, mugs of hot chocolate.  We make our beds in bivvy bags and I spend the hours trussing myself in ever more layers of fleece, down and discomfort, my body stiffening into cold. On this longest winter night, the moon has suffused the fog with a strange half-light, and I am as wakeful as when midsummer will not surrender the sky. At last it is morning and time to move. Clearing camp, we discover hair ice pluming from a fallen branch like candy floss, shiny white and soft to touch. An owl makes a wild, demonic shriek from deep in the trees, and we depart the forbidden isle. At first the canoe scrapes across the newly frozen ice ring before breaking through into water the colour of mercury. Beside us, the reed beds are furred with hoar frost, crackling as we brush past. Cloud holds sway all around, hiding horizons, smudging forest and land, blurring edges. Quietly, we slip back to civilisation, fugitives from another world.
