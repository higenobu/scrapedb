5/19/2022,"An angler recently reeled in a rare and “freaking scary” fish after casting his hook into a murky Texas marsh, photos show. The scaly creature’s striking look, jet black from tail to toothy tip, took the fisherman and his guide by surprise, according to a post by Lotus Guide Service. “Well … (we) found out melanistic gar do exist,” said the May 16 post, sharing photos of the fish whipping and thrashing against the fishing line. Long-established residents of Texas waterways, the prehistoric and prized alligator gar is typically brown or olive in color. But seemingly every inch of the one recently hooked in the “southeast Texas marsh” is dark black, save for the impressive teeth and pale gullet revealed by its open jaws. Though harmless to humans, alligator gar are fierce enough in appearance and in name to inspire fearful myths about them — and this strange variation is particularly stirring to some, even those familiar with the fish. “Freaking scary,” one commenter said. “Caught alligator gar growing up in Louisiana … put up a hell of a fight.” “I like this, looks hella mean,” another said. “Them thangs look deadly,” another read. Melanism, a genetic anomaly that causes darker fur, hair, skin or scales, is known to occur across the animal kingdom, though it is exceptionally rare, McClatchy News reported. How rare is melanism? Rare enough that experts generally lack enough data to offer exact figures. But there are reports of other gars with the condition having been caught or killed in the U.S. While the black alligator gar has some locals vowing to keep their toes out of the water for the foreseeable future, others were simply impressed. “Man that’s gorgeous,” a commenter said. Some were so impressed that, had they been the one to catch the gar, they said they’d have it mounted in their man cave or trophy room for all to see. The gar is safe from that fate, at least for now. The angler let the fish go after catching it, Lotus Guide Service said, with the photos as the only trophies taken. ‘Like walking a T-Rex.’ Angler uses rod, lasso to reel in huge alligator gar in Texas Angler reels in bass with parasitic surprise, Missouri photos show. ‘Lord have mercy’ 9-foot alligator found hundreds of miles from natural habitat is put down in Oklahoma Copperhead lurking in toolbox bites man fumbling around for wrench, Texas photos show",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"Angler reels in ‘freaking scary’ fish in Texas marsh, photos show.

5/19/2022,"The mother of a missing Russian sailor said her opinion of her government has changed. Still, she said she is fearful to say 'very harsh things' publicly about the Kremlin. ""Maybe best if I don't, because they would put me in prison for it,"" the mother told The Guardian. The mother of a Russian sailor who has been missing since Ukraine sunk Russia's Moskva missile cruiser ship in April said that her opinion of her government has drastically changed – but that she is worried about speaking out in her own country, according to The Guardian. The Ukrainians attacked the warship — loaded with military supplies and artillery — on April 14, striking and sinking the Moskva with anti-ship missiles. It's still unclear how many casualties in total resulted from the attack. ""I look at my government totally different since the war started,"" Tatyana Efremenko told The Guardian. Her son, Nikita, was a conscript on the ship, and she has not heard from him since the attack. ""There are some very harsh things I would like to say about our leadership, but maybe best if I don't because they would put me in prison for it,"" she added. At the outset of the war, Putin introduced and the Duma passed a draconian media censorship law that allows the government to jail journalists who report what the Kremlin deems to be ""fake"" news about the military. Reporters and private citizens can be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison, and cannot use the word ""war"" publicly to describe the war in Ukraine. After the Moskva attack, Moscow had claimed that the ship sank due to a fire on board. According to US officials who spoke with NBC News on the condition of anonymity, Ukrainian forces had asked their American counterparts for information about a ship south of Odesa, in the Black Sea. The US shared with Ukraine that the ship was indeed the Moskva and helped secure its exact location, according to the report. Officials who spoke with NBC News told the outlet that the US was not aware that Ukrainian officials would strike the ship.

5/19/2022,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The wife of a New Hampshire man accused of killing her co-worker after he discovered they were texting — and then forcing her to behead him — denied shooting him Wednesday, and testified that both were brutally assaulted by her husband in the hours leading up to the death that night. Britany Barron, 33, testified at her husband's first-degree murder trial that he choked and punched her and eventually put his gun into her mouth. “You know that you’re going to die tonight, right?” she testified her husband, Armando Barron, said in September 2020, not long before the two left the house to go to the park where he allegedly used her phone to tell the co-worker to meet her there. “Don't do anything stupid or the girls are going to walk into something (expletive) gruesome,"" she testified he said as they were leaving. He had sent the couple's three young children to go to their grandmother's home next door. On the way to the park, he read the texts aloud, striking her after finishing each one, she said. Britany, who asked a prosecutor in the Keene courtroom to address her by her maiden name, Mitchell, also testified that just a week earlier, she had told Armando she no longer loved him and wanted a divorce. When he heard that, he grabbed her throat and started choking her, saying, “Are you serious?"" She denied early in her testimony that she was the one who shot Jonathan Amerault, as a defense lawyer alleged during opening statements Tuesday. She pointed to her husband as the shooter. Barron pleaded not guilty to killing Amerault, 25. He acknowledged in court Tuesday that he had struck Britany, broke her nose, attempted to strangle her, and kicked Amerault in the head. Prosecutors allege that Armando Barron, 32, used his wife's cellphone to lure Amerault to the park just north of the Massachusetts state line the night he discovered the texts, beat and kicked Amerault and and tried to force his wife to shoot him. She refused. He also forced her to stand on his neck and slit his wrists, they said. Armando Barron forced Amerault into the back of the victim's car and told Britany to get into the driver's seat, she testified. At one point, he left them alone, she said. There was a machete inside and Britany testified that Amerault told her to pick it up and kill her husband, but she said no. “I wasn't going to test him,"" she said. She said Armando Barron eventually got into the car and shot Amerault three times. Barron had his wife drive the car back to their home in Jaffrey to pack some supplies, and he followed in the couple's car. They then headed 200 miles north (322 kilometers) to a remote campsite, with Barron talking on the phone with her throughout the trip, she testified. There, Armando Barron allegedly forced her to cut off Amerault’s head and bury it and wrap the body in a tarp. He left her to dispose of the body and returned home, she testified. “He said that we needed to cut off his head so that there would be no dental records of the body,"" Britany testified, saying she used a saw brought from home. She testified that they both destroyed evidence. The body was found by New Hampshire Fish and Game officers in a swamp after they found Britany at the campsite, where she was not allowed to camp. Britany testified that she and Amerault got to know each other better while working on a project in the days leading to his death and communicated via texting and social media apps. One afternoon, they drove to a nearby park after work and talked. She described him as kind, sweet and funny. “I said I couldn't offer anything more than friendship,"" she testified, and later gave him a quick kiss when he returned her to work so she could get her car. They shared one more kiss during a work break that week, a day before the texts were discovered. Britany pleaded guilty last year to three counts of falsifying evidence and was released from jail on parole last month. She apologized to Amerault’s family during her sentencing. The Associated Press had not been naming the couple in order not to identify Britany Barron, who said she suffered extreme abuse.

5/19/2022,"(Reuters) -The Kremlin said on Tuesday it would be ""outright theft"" for the Group of Seven economic powers and European Union to seize Russia's frozen reserves and spend them on behalf of Ukraine. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner told four European newspapers that he was open to the idea of seizing Russian state assets to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine and that proposals to that effect were already being discussed among the G7 and in the EU. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that no one had informed Russia of such an initiative, which he said would be ""illegal, blatant and of course requiring an appropriate response... It would be, in fact, outright theft.""

5/19/2022,"Madison Cawthorn lost his bid for reelection on Tuesday despite former President Trump’s efforts to lift him out of a self-created maelstrom of controversy. Sandy Smith is another diehard Trump devotee mired in controversy, but unlike the 26-year-old incumbent, she was able to prevail on Tuesday, winning a crowded Republican primary to represent the state’s 1st District in Congress. How exactly is Smith controversial? The far-right mayor of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, has has failed to file a financial disclosure — according to a fact check by the Raleigh News & Observer — and tweeted last year that she was present in Washington, D.C., for the rally that preceded the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. More from Rolling Stone Ex-Minneapolis Cop Pleads Guilty to Manslaughter in George Floyd's Death 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli Gets Early Prison Release Interpol Conjure Up a 'Summer Jam' With New Song 'Fables' She’s also been accused of abuse by multiple ex-husbands. Randy Auman, who was married to Smith from 1995 to 2001, told the Carolina Journal this month that she tried to run him over with a car. In 2009, another husband, Eric Goranson, wrote in a court filing that they split up after she woke him up in the middle of the night by repeatedly bashing him over the head with an alarm clock. The revelations come as part of a cache of opposition research her primary opponent, Sandy Roberson, tweeted a link to earlier this month, and ran an attack ad detailing several of them. Smith did not immediately reply to an email from Rolling Stone seeking clarification about her denial of the allegations of abuse. The North Carolina GOP, which congratulated Smith on her primary win on Tuesday, also did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Smith has denied the allegations, arguing they were dismissed in court, and threatening legal action against the people publicizing them. The swamp desperately DOES NOT WANT SANDY SMITH. I won't play their corrupt game. I am bringing a frying pan to DC, though. 🍳🍳🍳 (2/2) — Sandy Smith NC (@SandySmithNC) May 11, 2022 “I never ran over anyone with a car and I never hit anyone in the head with a frying pan,” she wrote. “If I did that don’t you think I would be in jail? All of these #FakeNews allegations have been dismissed by a judge and the people peddling these lies will PAY when I take them to court.” She added that she will be “bringing a frying pan to DC.” Auman told the Carolina Journal in an interview that Smith took swings at him (the article makes no mention of kitchenware) but never injured him, although he did acknowledge that she attempted to run him over with his Mustang. Roberson has said Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield had the information in the files two years ago when he was running against Smith, but opted not to release it because the race was not close. Smith lost to Butterfield in 2020 by nearly 10 percentage points, but the seat is now up for grabs after Butterfield announced his retirement last fall. Smith beat Roberson by around five percentage points on Tuesday, and will take on Democrat state Sen. Donald Davis in the general election. Sen. Davis’ campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Rolling Stone. The troves of files released by Roberson includes allegations of abuse not just from her two ex-husbands, but from her daughter, who filed for a protective order against Smith in 2012. Tiffany Anderson wrote in the request that her mother told her she was going to be a “trailer trash loser” if she didn’t go into the military against her will. The exchange then became physical, according to Anderson’s statement. “She pushed and shoved me, she slapped me, pulled my hair, pulled me to the ground and sat on me,” she wrote. “She held me down by my hair and punched me in the face with a closed fist.” Smith is also a conspiracy theorist who has touted endorsements from people like Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Reps. Cawthorn and Paul Gosar, as well as Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers, who is currently under an ethics investigation for suggesting that Saturday’s mass shooting in Buffalo was a false flag, and whose tweets Smith shares regularly. Smith has bragged that she is the only candidate in the race who believes Trump won the 2020 election, and her website includes a link to a petition to audit North Carolina’s election results — despite the fact that Trump won the state convincingly. Smith will be an underdog to win the general election for North Carolina’s 1st district, where Democrats have traditionally dominated. But her primary victory and support from the Republican establishment is another sign that conspiracy theorists and extremists have taken over the party’s mainstream. Fitness for office is an afterthought so long as a candidate is able to hit all the notes Trump requires, most importantly denying that the 2020 election was legitimate. Smith’s win also isn’t the first time a Republican accused of spousal abuse has won a primary this cycle. Earlier this month an Indiana man won a school board primary despite being in jail for allegedly murdering his wife with a flower pot.
