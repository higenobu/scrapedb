2/7/2022,"The winner of a Las Vegas slot machine jackpot never knew he won more than $229,000 due to a ""communications error"" in the machine, according to a press release from the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Robert Taylor, of Arizona, won the jackpot on Jan. 8 at Treasure Island Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. However, due to the error, a malfunction occurred ""that prevented Mr. Taylor and casino personnel from realizing that a progressive jackpot had been won,"" the release states. The release states that once it had been confirmed that a jackpot had been won but hadn't been dispensed, the gaming board underwent an extensive search to find the winner. “The Nevada Gaming Control Board is charged with the strict regulation of the gaming industry, the protection of the gaming public, and ensuring that the industry benefits the State of Nevada,” said James Taylor, chief of the board’s enforcement division. “I commend the agents of the Enforcement Division, particularly Agent Dan Nuqui, for ensuring that the public trust in the gaming industry remains strong by spending countless hours over two weeks to ensure that a patron is awarded winnings owed to him."" The investigation to find Taylor involved reviewing multiple hours of surveillance footage, witness interviews, reviewing electronic records, and analyzing rideshare information, the release states. After reviewing this information, Taylor was identified and, on Jan. 28, he was notified of his winnings. Taylor was scheduled to pick up his winnings this weekend.",U.S./NBC News,"Gaming board tracks down Las Vegas $229,000 jackpot winner after slot machine malfunction",https://news.yahoo.com/gaming-board-tracks-down-las-200446266.html
2/7/2022,"A Midlands woman said she was “very thankful,” after winning $100,000 on a Powerball ticket. But she couldn’t help but think about what might have been if her ticket had matched all five numbers instead of just four, South Carolina Education Lottery officials said in a news release. “That number haunts me,” she said in the release. While $100,000 is a significant prize, it’s hard to compare it to the $632.6 million jackpot that was won in the same drawing. In fact, it was the size of the massive prize that motivated the woman — who doesn’t usually play lottery games — to buy a ticket, according to the release. So while she’s thankful, it’s fair for anyone in her position to have 632.5 million what-ifs. The six-figure winning Powerball ticket was purchased in Barnwell, lottery officials said in a news release. The ticket matched four of the first five white balls, along with the red Powerball number, according to the release. The winning numbers — 6, 14, 25, 33, 46, and Powerball: 17 — were drawn on Jan. 5. Because the ticket buyer purchased the PowerPlay option for an additional dollar, her $50,000 prize was doubled to $100,000 when a x2 was drawn, lottery officials said. The winner did not tell lottery officials how she will spend the money from the windfall. The woman’s name was not released because South Carolina is one of eight states — along with Delaware, Kansas, Georgia, Maryland, North Dakota, Ohio and Texas — that allow lottery winners to remain anonymous. The odds of winning $100,000 playing Powerball are 913,129-to-1, according to the release. The odds of a x2 multiplier being selected are 1 in 1.75 when the jackpot is more than $150 million, lottery officials said. The winning ticket was sold at Quick & Easy gas station/convenience store at 10077 Marlboro Ave. in downtown Barnwell. Quick & Easy received a commission of $1,000 for selling the claimed winning ticket.",U.S./The State,SC woman wins six-figure Powerball prize but is haunted by missing $632 million jackpot,https://news.yahoo.com/sc-woman-wins-six-figure-191047094.html
2/7/2022,"Attorneys for GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry say he was confused when questioned by the FBI. A federal grand jury in October indicted him on charges of lying to the FBI in connection with an investigation into potential campaign finance violations. His attorneys plan to call up an expert who can speak to the fallibility of memory and aging. Attorneys representing GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry plan to argue the Nebraska lawmaker was confused because of his age during FBI questioning on potential campaign finance violations, according to new court documents. Pretrial briefs filed on Friday say his attorneys plan to call up an expert who can speak to the fallibility of memory and aging to contest the accusation that he lied to the FBI, The Omaha World-Herald reported. According to the report, his lawyers said they wanted his entire conversation with the FBI played for the jury to show agents' questions were repetitive and Fortenberry was confused rather than lying. Representatives for Fortenberry did not immediately return Insider's request for comment on Sunday. Prosecutors pushed back on the request, saying such an expert would only make common-sense observations about memory, according to the report. A federal grand jury in October indicted Fortenberry, 61, on charges of lying to the FBI. The indictment charged him with one count of ""scheming to falsify and conceal material facts"" and two counts of making false statements to investigators in connection with an FBI investigation into potential campaign finance violations. Fortenberry is among several lawmakers who investigators said received illegal campaign contributions from the Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire Gilbert Chagoury, violating federal laws banning foreign nationals from donating to political candidates. ""A number of years ago, some very bad people illegally transferred money into my campaign, along with several other members of Congress,"" Fortenberry said in October in response to the accusations. ""They were caught, they were punished and they've been held accountable, thankfully."" According to an FBI affidavit filed earlier this year, the donations went to Fortenberry's campaign in March 2016. ""I answered their questions. Later, we went back and answered further questions,"" Fortenberry said in a YouTube video. ""I told them what I knew and what I understood. They've accused me of lying to them and are charging me with this. We're shocked. We're stunned. I feel so personally betrayed. We thought we were trying to help and so now we will have to fight."" Fortenberry has pleaded not guilty to all charges. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Tuesday before US District Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. of Los Angeles. A trial date has not yet been set, The Omaha World-Herald reported. Insider's Grace Panetta and Sonam Sheth contributed to this report.
