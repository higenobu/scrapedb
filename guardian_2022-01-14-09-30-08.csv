1/14/2022,"Victoria Beckham will return to the form-fitting dresses with which she launched her fashion career in a bid to bounce back from sales lost during the pandemic. “VB Body” dresses, in a dense compact knit designed to shape the body and accentuate curves, will be launched in April, marking a departure from the loose silhouettes which have become the signature at her loss-making high-fashion label.  At a preview in her London studio, Beckham said the shift was influenced by spending time in Florida, where her husband, David Beckham, owns a stake in football team Inter Miami. “As I’ve gotten into fashion, the more layers of clothes I have worn. I’ve been burying myself under clothes. But in Miami, if you go out at night in a midi length skirt and a pussy-bow blouse, people think you’ve lost your mind. That is a normal outfit for me in London and I still love wearing it. But Miami has opened my eyes to the fact that looking feminine and curvy is so important to so many women.” Beckham’s luxury brand lost £8.6m in 2020. The results were an improvement on 2019’s £16.8m losses, due to a strong performing beauty line, but the brand is yet to turn a profit. Last year, average prices at the label were reduced by 40% by a shift toward casual wear and simpler fabrics, in a bid to broaden the customer base. Price tags for the VB Body range will start at £90. “This is not a vanity project and commercial is not a dirty word,” said Beckham, who praised the chief executive, Marie Leblanc, “for getting the business into the best shape it has ever been in”. Footfall at the brand’s Mayfair flagship remains well short of pre-pandemic levels, although virtual appointments conducted from the store via FaceTime with clients in their homes are bringing in sales. “I dress women to go out, to go to work, to travel – all things which have been limited over the past two years, so business has been a real challenge,” Beckham said. “I think it’s time to get back to normal, to start dressing properly and get back to the office again, if I’m perfectly honest. It’s great to see my office full again.” Financial restraint looks set to rule out a catwalk show during London fashion week. “Shows are really expensive, and if we were going to have one in February we’d need to commit to that now. For a small independent brand that’s a huge investment,” said Beckham. A planned show was cancelled due to lockdown in 2020 at a significant loss to the business. The designer joins a growing list of cancellations scaling back the approaching catwalk season, with Giorgio Armani, Ann Demeulemeester, Brunello Cucinelli and JW Anderson all postponing live events or pivoting to a digital format. Beckham’s high-fashion “pre-fall” collection, which will go on sale in April, brings her mantra of “bringing sexy back” to her signature demure silhouette. Curved seaming has been optimised on long skirts and dresses “to make the most of a great bum and a good waist, to celebrate being a woman. I don’t want to dress for comfort or hide under baggy clothes any more.” Bright citrus shades in the collection were inspired by the pistachio seating and marmalade coloured walls at the Sant Ambroeus restaurant in Palm Beach, Florida. “We were having dinner, and I had David [Beckham] take a picture of me so I could send it to the atelier,” the designer said. “A wink of bad taste makes the collection cooler.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Victoria Beckham’s brand goes back to ‘feminine and curvy’,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/14/victoria-beckham-fashion-brand-vb-body
1/14/2022,"The most deprived state schools in England have been hit much harder by staff absence with Covid, compared with those in better-off areas or private schools, according to a new survey of classroom teachers. The TeacherTapp daily online survey of teachers found that 29% of those working in schools with high numbers of pupils from deprived backgrounds said at least one in 10 of their colleagues were off or isolating with Covid.  The survey done on 7 January revealed that nearly a third of all teachers said between 5% and 10% of their colleagues were off, across both primary and secondary schools. But at schools with more than 10% of staff off, there was a dramatic divergence. While 30% of teachers at secondary schools with the highest proportion of pupils on free school meals said that 10% or more of their colleagues were off, just 9% of teachers at schools with the fewest pupils on free school meals said the same. Similarly, while one in four teachers at state schools said they didn’t have enough staff to cover absences, just 9% of teachers at private schools reported the same. On the upside, 95% of teachers at state schools reported that they had sufficient supplies of lateral flow tests for their pupils. Sir Peter Lampl, chair and founder of the Sutton Trust, which published the findings, said poorer pupils should not be further disadvantaged as a result of the pandemic, adding: “The most important thing for the government to do is to strengthen existing education recovery and make sure sufficient funding is being provided to cover absent staff.” The survey of nearly 6,500 teachers also found that in some schools more than a third of pupils did not have access to laptops or tablets at home if required for remote learning. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it “beggars belief” that pupils were still without digital devices nearly two years into the pandemic. “The government made great play of its efforts to provide laptops to schools last year but it seems it did not see the job through. The use of technology in education has been one of the few positives to come from the pandemic but it is of little use if young people cannot access lessons when they are self-isolating,” Barton said.",News/Education,"Deprived state schools in England hit hardest by Covid staff absences, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/14/deprived-state-schools-in-england-hid-hardest-by-covid-staff-absences-survey-finds
1/14/2022,"The UK government has been urged to cut English cricket’s funding unless the England and Wales Cricket Board can prove it is serious about tackling the “deep-seated racism” that exists across the whole sport. That is the damning recommendation of a parliamentary inquiry into racism that concludes cricket’s problem is not only “endemic” but the governing body has known about it and failed to properly act.The 13-page report by the digital, culture, media and sport select committee also praises the former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq, who spoke so bravely about the shocking abuse he suffered in November, but says his testimony must now lead to real change.  It has ordered the ECB to provide parliament with quarterly updates on its plans to tackle racism and says unless there is sustained progress the £2.2m the ECB receives each year from Sport England for the grassroots game could be at risk.“We recommend that the government ensures that any future public funds for cricket are dependent on continuous, demonstrable progress in getting rid of racism in both the dressing rooms and in the stands,” it states. “We recommend that the ECB board develop a set of key indicators by which they might measure their progress and then report to us on those indicators every quarter.”The report follows the staggering evidence given to the committee by Rafiq, who laid bare the racism, bullying and “inhuman” treatment he faced over a number of years at Yorkshire – along with the club’s and the ECB’s failure to adequately respond. The MPs describe Rafiq’s testimony as “convincing” and say they agree with his conviction “that this was not simply a personal issue but an endemic problem across the whole of cricket”. “The language used in correspondence received by members of our committee subsequent to the evidence session with Azeem, and the manner in which stories were run in the press to discredit Azeem, further establish, to us, that eradicating racism from the game will be a long and difficult road,” they add. The report was welcomed by Rafiq, who said it was “brilliant” that the ECB and Yorkshire were being held to account but agreed they needed to be given the chance to show they were making progress. “The DCMS committee has listened and taken sensible action,” he added. “This shows just how seriously politicians are taking an issue that too many people in cricket ignored for so long. The committee understands how important it is to clean up the game. The ECB and Yorkshire need to be given the chance to do the right thing and I’m encouraged by Lord Patel’s work since he was appointed chair at YCCC.” There has been surprise in some quarters about the report’s threat to cut funding given that much of it goes on helping children in deprived areas. However the ECB’s interim chair, Barry O’Brien, said the game’s governing body accepted the broad thrust of the report and promised to rebuild trust in the sport. “We embrace the ongoing scrutiny of the committee and all those that love the game of cricket who will be watching closely as we undertake the continuous, demonstrable progress in eradicating racism from the dressing room and from the stands,” he said. “We are determined to root out racism – and other forms of discrimination – from our sport. “We look forward to updating the committee on the progress the whole game is making in delivering the 12-point Action Plan agreed in November to bring about the meaningful change we all want to see,” he added. “We are deeply sorry for the pain people have suffered and recognise the courage it has taken to speak out.” That message was echoed by Lord Patel, now chair at Yorkshire. “Azeem Rafiq’s testimony was a watershed moment for the sport as a whole, and we are committed to ensuring that no one endures the unacceptable experience that he did at Yorkshire County Cricket Club,” he said. “In the last two months Yorkshire has made significant progress in our efforts to rebuild but we are only at the start of this long and important journey.”Meanwhile, a DCMS spokesman noted that there had been “encouraging progress” in recent weeks. But he also warned: “There is no place for discrimination in society and we want to see clear and sustained evidence of cultural change in the sport.” The CEO of Sport England, Tim Hollingsworth, struck a similar tone as he urged the ECB, the counties, and other cricketing stakeholders to reform and take “action to end structural racism in the sport”. “Sport England’s funding is explicitly linked to the development and implementation of robust diversity and inclusion policies,” he said. “We have made that clear to the ECB, who have responded positively and constructively. “Azeem Rafiq’s powerful and personal testimony to the committee shows us that ultimately, the litmus test of progress will be the lived experiences of diverse communities and their involvement in the game. Until experiences like Azeem’s are eradicated, the work to defeat racism in sport must continue.”",Sport/Sport,"Cut English cricket’s funding over ‘deep-seated racism’, government urged",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/cut-english-crickets-funding-over-deep-seated-racism-government-urged
1/14/2022,"Google has announced a $1bn (£871m) deal to buy the London development Central Saint Giles, calling the move a show of confidence in the return to more office working. The US tech firm currently rents space in the brightly coloured development designed by the architect Renzo Piano, which is located in the centre of the capital, near Oxford Street.  The building – with its distinctive red, green, orange and yellow facade – includes 408,000 sq ft (38,000 sq metres) of office space, as well as more than 100 residential apartments, and is home to restaurants and cafes on the ground floor. After the purchase, Google will have space for 10,000 employees in the UK, a significant increase on the 6,400 staff it currently has in the country, 700 of whom joined the company over the past year. The company has offices in London and Manchester. Google’s new London headquarters – a huge horizontal building known as “the landscraper” – is under construction next to the railway lines that run in and out of King’s Cross railway station. The glass building will stretch out by a total of 330 metres, longer than the 310-metre-tall Shard skyscraper. The main structural works are expected to be finished this year, and once completed it will stand 11 storeys tall, boasting a 25-metre swimming pool, indoor basketball court and massage rooms as well as a roof garden. Despite the rise of home working during the Covid pandemic, Google reaffirmed its commitment to the project in summer 2020. Google is also promising a multimillion-pound refurbishment of its Central Saint Giles offices to create a post-pandemic workplace that has “parity” to its King’s Cross base. Desks will be more spaced out, and the redeveloped building will include additional meeting rooms and covered outdoor working areas. The investment is also likely to be seen as a boost for Oxford Street, the capital’s busiest shopping street, which has seen a string of well-known retailers close their doors during the pandemic. Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google and its parent company, Alphabet, said the purchase of Central Saint Giles reflected the company’s “continued commitment to [the UK’s] growth and success”. She added: “Our focus remains on creating flexible workspaces that foster innovation, creativity and inclusivity.” Post-Covid, Google will operate a hybrid workplace model, with staff splitting their time between the office and another location, and spending on average three days a week at their desks. Staff are also allowed to request working entirely remotely, although this will not be possible for all roles.",News/Technology,Google in $1bn deal to buy Central Saint Giles offices in London,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/14/google-deal-buy-central-saint-giles-offices-london
1/14/2022,"Back to the shambles, then. No, not the Ashes tour. This is from the other side of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s Rubik’s Cube of problems. Six weeks ago the ECB’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, was asked why any of the many people who have heard him and his predecessors talk over and again about their renewed efforts to address racism in the sport ought to take this latest ECB scheme seriously. What was it, exactly, that was going to make the new action plan any more effective than the Clean Bowl Racism campaign the ECB launched in 2000? Or the South Asian Action Plan in 2018? Why was this step forward for Yorkshire going to take them further than the ones the club promised when they launched anti-racism projects in 1992, 1999 or 2015?  All Harrison was really able to offer was his own say-so. “I know that we are in the dock for words, words, words, blah, blah, blah, no action – that kind of thing,” Harrison said. “What we are trying to say here is that this is action-orientated.” Given the latest set of 12 actions includes a few that he had already promised the ECB would deliver under the 11-step-programme it set up four years ago, it wasn’t hugely reassuring. The game has never suffered a lack of good intentions, just a lack of good outcomes. Now we have a better answer. The digital, culture, media and sport committee’s new report on racism recommends that the government should tie any future public funding for the ECB to its making demonstrable progress in anti-racism, and that the select committee should help monitor that progress by asking the ECB to report back to it each quarter. Whether those recommendations are actually adopted is another question, but the report highlighted a promise from the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, that the government “would be closely monitoring the ECB’s progress” and take “further measures” if needed. It’s true, the ECB really has ended up in a position where it has put this Tory party in a position of moral authority. Who knew there was high ground in the gutter? There are flaws in the committee’s plan. The ECB receives about £2.5m annually from Sport England. But most of that goes towards developing grassroots cricket, which means that cutting the funding would only exacerbate the problems it is asking the ECB to address. But the threat will certainly sharpen its thinking, and help hurry along some of the counties who pushed back against its more radical plans to deal with racism at the all-game meeting last November. Harrison said himself he was frustrated they hadn’t been able to go further. The ECB has also benefited from a lot of bailout money, most recently its share of the £300m given to “summer sports” last year. And a little more scrutiny on exactly how it’s being used would be a good thing. (You can find a more in-depth look at its accounts, if you’re interested, at the Side On View cricket blog). The latest set of financial statements from 2020-21 show that the ECB has blown through £68m in reserves, and now has only £2m left. Most of it apparently went on organising The Hundred, a tournament that a large number of people who actually pay to watch the game seem to hate, and which, because it has taken over the middle of the summer, now seems to be the single biggest obstacle to rearranging the first-class cricket schedule to better serve the needs of the ailing Test team. That £68m might have come in handy as a rainy-day fund if the sport had ever found itself facing a crisis beyond its control, like, oh I don’t know, a global pandemic. Instead the ECB found itself drawing on public money to help it along. Of course it took its own measures to mitigate the losses too. In 2020 it announced it was making staff cutbacks. And the statements show it did cut the number of development staff by almost a fifth, from 101 to 82. (The grassroots, which would be further threatened by those cuts in Sport England funding, are already suffering). Oddly, though, the overall headcount actually increased from 379 to 416. That was because of (yes, you guessed) The Hundred. It wasn’t just that it had to hire players and coaching staff, it also expanded the commercial, communications and events team (from 57 to 82). The upshot was that ECB’s payroll costs actually rose by £6.6m during the first year of the pandemic, which means wages and salaries are currently outstripping the total amount (£38m) the ECB spends on grassroots cricket. Again, a large part of that rise is down to the hires made for The Hundred. But not all of it. Aggregate boardroom pay rose by 11% and topped £1m for the first time. As a footnote in the accounts explains, however, these rising costs were offset by furlough funds received from HMRC. That 11% rise was despite Harrison’s own well-publicised pay cut, (from £580,000 to £512,000). Fortunately for him it seems that’s likely to be offset too, by his share of the £2.1m “long term incentive plan”, which becomes payable this year “provided the employee remains in full-time employment” at the due date. It has been widely reported that Harrison will step down at some time in the next few months, which is one reason why he has been able to hold on to his job during this rolling omnishambles.

1/14/2022,"Hostilities resume in the unlikely derby as Brighton seek their first league win against Crystal Palace in six attempts. In September’s reverse fixture, Brighton needed a Neal Maupay goal in the fifth minute of added time to rescue a point from a spicy encounter at Selhurst Park. Friday’s fixture at the Amex Stadium could be as much about who is present as who isn’t, with both sides missing key players on duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. Mali’s Yves Bissouma will be absent from the Brighton ranks, while Palace find themselves without Wilfried Zaha, Cheikhou Kouyaté and the in-form Jordan Ayew. The Ghanaian’s absence will herald another starting opportunity for Michael Olise, who was outstanding in the FA Cup victory against Millwall last weekend and in the league defeat against West Ham seven days previously. His battle against Brighton’s hugely impressive Spanish wing-back Marc Cucurella ought to be key in deciding the outcome of a potentially fiery match that looks extremely difficult to call. BG  Brighton v Crystal Palace, Friday 8pm (all times GMT) At Chelsea, Antonio Conte had a miserable record against Arsenal: just one win from eight encounters – and at a time when the west Londoners were a much stronger outfit, with Arsène Wenger in the final, troubled stretch of his tenure. Defeats to Arsenal bookended Conte’s imperial period at Chelsea. Three goals down at the Emirates in September 2016, Conte switched to a back-three formation that provided the framework for Chelsea’s dominant title win that season. But the 2017 FA Cup final, a defeat to a motivated, excellent Arsenal to lift the final trophy of Wenger’s career, was the beginning of the end for Conte at Chelsea. It came ahead of a transfer window where bridges were burned between him and the club hierarchy. It appears too early for that yet in his Tottenham reign, but a somewhat submissive selection in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi defeat to Chelsea suggested he was sending a message of sincere dissatisfaction. Watch that space. JB Tottenham v Arsenal, Sunday 4.30pm For all Chelsea’s midweek dominance against Tottenham –aside from one brief second-half spell, Thomas Tuchel seemed extremely displeased with his players even though they had comfortably booked their berth in next month’s Carabao Cup final. “We were almost punished for our lack of focus,” he said at the final whistle. “We played at 90% and that’s not our style – we shouldn’t do this.” With a Saturday lunchtime appointment at Manchester City looming, it was a timely broadside across the bows of players who simply must win at the Etihad to maintain any hope of reeling in the runaway leaders. Chelsea may not be good enough to beat a City side currently firing on all cylinders, but should they fail to do so, it probably won’t be down to any lack of concentration or application following their manager’s rocket up the collective backside. BG Manchester City v Chelsea, Saturday 12.30pm Burnley have more league matches remaining this season than any other team in the top flight, so that is one thing in their favour. Now all they need to do is find a way, and a player, to score enough goals for them to survive. With Chris Wood sold to Newcastle this week and Max Cornet away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Burnley will host Leicester with a strike force that boasts one league goal between them this season – and that is only if Matej Vydra has recovered from Covid and a nagging groin problem. Their attack will most likely be led by Jay Rodriguez, who at least scored in last week’s home FA Cup defeat to Huddersfield. Leicester have striker problems too – Jamie Vardy is injured, Kelechi Iheanacho is at the Cup of Nations and Patson Dakais an injury doubt – but Brendan Rodgers’ side do at least have midfielders who can weigh in with goals. Burnley’s chances of scoring on Saturday may hinge on Ben Mee, their top league scorer this season after Wood and Cornet, and a player capable of exploiting Leicester’s ongoing set-piece problems. PD Burnley v Leicester, Saturday 3pm These are exciting times at Aston Villa. Philippe Coutinho will surely make his debut on Saturday with Lucas Digne likely to do so too. Steven Gerrard has clearly made Villa attractive to a better-heeled tranche of footballers, but results in the last month have been rather less impressive than their transfer business. Three defeats have followed the win at Norwich – losses to Chelsea and Manchester United either side of a more worrying display at Brentford, where Mads Roerslev’s late winner was perhaps most indicative. The all-action style Gerrard demands from his players appears to coincide with flagging energy levels towards the end of matches. At Old Trafford on Monday, Villa had a sagging, incoherent United on the ropes from the start of the second half, only for the FA Cup third-round tie to be closed out reasonably comfortably. It may take time – and a pre-season – for Villa to be able to meet their manager’s physical demands. JB Aston Villa v Manchester United, Saturday 5.30pm After seeing their team win just one game and draw three from their past 12 Premier League outings, Everton supporters are mutinous. This week’s sale of their talented French left-back Lucas Digne to Aston Villa, in the wake of his reported falling-out with Rafa Benítez, is likely to have further enraged a fanbase whose patience with their manager was already wearing cigarette paper-thin. “Sometimes it only takes one person from outside to destroy a beautiful love affair,” wrote Digne in his farewell message, in what has widely been perceived as a dig at his former manager. With Benítez’s side heading to Carrow Road to face an abominably bad Norwich City side on Saturday, anything less than emphatic victory would further damage the already fractious relationship between Everton fans and their manager. BG Norwich v Everton, Saturday 3pm Liverpool’s current run of fixtures can also be viewed as an extension of Mohamed Salah’s contract negotiations. The team made a strong case for giving Salah everything he wants by performing prosaically against 10-man Arsenal in Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield. The hosts lacked sharpness and ingenuity without Salah and Sadio Mané, among others, while Salah’s ostensible deputy, Takumi Minamino, underlined the Egyptian’s importance – and the shallowness of Liverpool’s squad – by missing an open goal late on. A similar performance when they host Brentford in the league on Sunday could result in them falling even further behind in the title race. PD Liverpool v Brentford, Sunday 2pm Jackie Milburn, Malcolm Macdonald, Les Ferdinand, Alan Shearer … Chris Wood? The New Zealander filling a Callum Wilson-shaped hole in Newcastle’s attack, and the £25m paid for a striker with three goals all season, shows the difficulty of recruitment in the January transfer window. Wood, a decent, troublesome and unselfish forward, will have to do for now as Newcastle look less a superclub in waiting than Burnley-on-Tyne, with Wood joining ex-Claret Kieran Tripper in their ranks under a former Turf Moor manager in Eddie Howe. Harpooning the chances of a less wealthy relegation rival is the limit of Newcastle ambitions for now – and until the drop is avoided, the club can only operate on such a short-term footing. What fans might have said if Mike Ashley and Steve Bruce had turned to Wood as the answer is one for the birds. A first Wood goal in seven weeks and a defeat of Watford, another relegation rival, is desperately required. JB Newcastle v Watford, Saturday 3pm Bruno Lage was shrewd enough to stick with a back-three formation after taking charge of Wolves last summer, with the emergence of Max Kilman on the right helping the team continue using the shape with which most of the players were familiar. But with Romain Saïss at the Cup of Nations with Morocco, Lage has to find another player to deploy alongside Kilman and Conor Coady. Marçal did well on the left side of the back three in last weekend’s FA Cup win over Sheffield United until being forced off by injury at half-time, after which the midfielder Leander Dendoncker filled in competently. But Southampton will pose a tougher test on Saturday, especially with Armando Broja continuing to distinguish himself as an outstanding young attacking talent. Ralph Hassenhüttl hopes to convince Southampton’s new owner to find a way of making Broja’s loan move from Chelsea permanent in the summer. It will be up to Wolves’ makeshift defence to stop the 20-year-old from strengthening the argument for doing so. PD Wolves v Southampton, Saturday 3pm As Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United falter in their chase for a top-four place, West Ham have been taking care of business. The expectation is a thin squad will eventually run out of energy, as happened last season, but David Moyes’s team are currently in fourth place on merit. The improvement in the last 18 months of the likes of Jarrod Bowen, Manuel Lanzini and Declan Rice is a tribute to their manager, a rediscovery of the team-building expertise that first made his reputation at Preston and Everton. Rice is a reminder that stars can be made rather than bought in, while Bowen, who scored twice in Wednesday’s win over Norwich, is a reminder that stars can also be bought and made from the lower tiers. Such old-fashioned values are prevailing over the elite clubs chasing West Ham’s tail, and a repeat of last week’s 2-0 FA Cup defeat of Leeds would keep the Hammers ahead.

1/14/2022,"Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is being sued for £2.3bn in a class action lawsuit that claims 44 million Facebook users in the UK had their data exploited after signing up to the social network. The case argues that Meta has broken the 1998 Competition Act by setting an “unfair price” for Facebook’s UK users when they are given access to the service. The lawsuit brought by the legal expert Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen argues that the price for getting on Facebook, which does not charge its users, is handing over personal data that generates most of the company’s income.  Worldwide, Meta makes 98% of its income from advertisers, who are able to target specific demographics and consumers because the company has built up profiles of its users through their online activity. “They are exploiting users by taking their personal data without properly compensating them for taking that data,” said Lovdahl Gormsen, who added that Facebook had a “completely disproportionate” relationship with its users. “I don’t think the users are entirely clear when they click on the terms and conditions how unfair that deal is.” Lovdahl Gormsen, a competition law specialist at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, is bringing the class action at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London as an opt-out case. This means Facebook users covered by it do not need to actively join the case to receive damages and will be part of the claim unless they decide to opt out from it. The lawsuit covers the period from 1 October 2015 to 31 December 2019. The lawsuit is being funded by Innsworth, a firm that pays for litigation in exchange for a share of any damages, and Lovdahl Gormsen is being represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a law firm that describes itself as a specialist in “high-stakes commercial litigation”. Lovdhal Gormsen’s lawyers have written to Meta, which also owns the photo-sharing app Instagram and the WhatsApp messaging service, to notify it of the claim. The claim will then be heard by a judge at the tribunal, who will decide whether the case should go ahead. If it does go ahead, the case could take between 6 and 12 months. A Meta spokesperson said: “People access our service for free. They choose our services because we deliver value for them and they have meaningful control of what information they share on Meta’s platforms and who with. We have invested heavily to create tools that allow them to do so.” On Tuesday, a US federal judge ruled that the US competition watchdog could proceed with a breakup lawsuit against Meta. The Federal Trade Commission wants to force Meta to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, in one of the biggest challenges the government has brought against a tech company in decades.

1/14/2022,"Elizabeth Holmes is slated to be sentenced on 26 September after being found guilty of defrauding Theranos investors, according to a court filing on Wednesday.  A California jury found Holmes, 37, guilty on four of 11 charges, including three counts of fraud and one count of conspiring to defraud private investors in the blood-testing startup. She remains free on a $500,000 bond while awaiting sentencing. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison for the charges but will likely receive far fewer, according to experts, given her lack of criminal history. Holmes’ sentencing was set for later in 2022 to allow for the trial of Sunny Balwani, her former personal and professional partner whose trial for related fraud charges will begin in March. Holmes alleged during her trial she was abused by Balwani, who served for 10 years as co-president of the company. Balwani has strongly denied claims of mistreating Holmes. Holmes had risen to fame and power while claiming her Theranos machines could run common blood tests on a few drops from a finger prick. Once valued at $9bn, the company collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate. Holmes was acquitted on three charges, including one conspiracy to defraud patients and two charges related to patients who received inaccurate test results. One charge was thrown out earlier in the trial and the jury did not come to a verdict on the remaining three charges. In a separate court filing, government attorneys said they plan to dismiss the three counts the jury did not reach a verdict on. Holmes plans to ask the judge overseeing her case to overturn her convictions, according to court filings. If he does not, she is likely to appeal and could seek to suspend her sentence until a final ruling. Her conviction sealed the extraordinary rise and fall of the company and could have wide-ranging consequences for the tech industry. It also marked an indictment of the hype machine that helped rocket Holmes to fame, as she graced the covers of major magazines, headlined conferences, and drew comparisons to Apple’s Steve Jobs. During the trial which took place in San Jose, she reportedly lived on a 74-acre estate in a town neighboring the city with her partner Billy Evans and their infant son.

All of them do the trick, but the steamiest option is a blue surgical mask. Notable quote: “The results run counter to the pre-pandemic research,” says Dr Michael Lewis, who worked on the study. Back then, “it was thought masks made people think about disease and the person should be avoided”. How long will it take me to read? Only two minutes.

Now the founders of the movement have stepped beyond the big blue app to launch one of their own. Why? To make it “more accessible [to people] who have been unable for a variety of reasons to connect with it on other platforms, so we get a more diverse set of voices”. Notable quote: “The stuff is one thing, but the stories that go along with it – the humour, the poignancy, the memories – those are the things we really want from each other,” says Buy Nothing’s co-founder Rebecca Rockefeller.

When Texas school principal Dr James Whitfield wrote a letter to students after the death of George Floyd, he was praised for speaking openly about racism in America. A year and a half later, that letter had cost him his job. How? “Nobody in the community was calling me or anything,” Whitfield says. “But I started to hear word that, ‘Hey, these people are talking about you and they’re saying you’re doing critical race theory’.” Critical race theory? Yes. You may remember that phrase from Australia’s own legislative conflicts over the national curriculum in mid-2021; which US-based journalist Jason Wilson described as an “absurd moral panic” at the time. The internet’s favourite new puzzle gets a dark clone, Absurdle, which is designed to make finding the right answer as hard as possible. There are heaps of Wordle knock-offs now, right?

1/14/2022,"Can somebody tell me why we have such a dichotomy in Australia whereby parents love their babies and young children with a passion but on a national policy basis their needs and the needs of those that care for them are continually overlooked? Having assessed the evidence that Covid appears to be a relatively mild illness in children, it appears as if our commonwealth and state and territory governments have just never checked in to see how the services that care for them – our early education and care (childcare) services – are going.  How are they going? The good news is that so far children are surviving. Despite almost 88,000 children under the age of nine having caught Covid in Australia so far, there have only been two deaths. But when it comes to the services that care and educate our youngest children, our long daycare services, preschools, family daycare services and out-of-school hours care services, and the educators and teachers that staff these services, the news is less good. Since the very start of the pandemic the capacity of these services to stay afloat has been seriously at risk. Governments have continually put in short-term financial aid to parents and services to keep their doors open. But then they withdraw it. Because it was only ever a range of temporary patches over a gaping wound. So here we are with Covid ripping through the country and we have education and care services, and the people that are staffing them, once again going under. Financially they can’t survive without further support if they have to keep waiving parents’ fees because the parents are keeping their children home out of fear or because they have to shut down because too many of their staff have Covid or are close contacts. Every solution to this problem has been brought in on a temporary basis only because, I don’t know, you can’t keep making things free, can you? Even if your economy and your health system desperately need childcare centres to keep their doors open. The people who manage these services are frantically trying to ensure that they keep the children and babies in their care safe. They must under the National Quality Framework they operate under. Quality Area 2 of this framework demands that services safeguard children’s health and safety, minimise risks and protect children from harm and infection. This is what they are required to always do, even when we aren’t in the middle of a pandemic. But in some states like NSW they have been told that staff no longer have to isolate if there is a positive case in their centre. Even if they have spent 10 hours in the same room or with the positive child in their laps! How can anyone ignore that this puts children and other staff at high risk of catching this blasted virus? But no, apparently you can only catch Covid in homes. Not in a centre where hundreds of children spend the hours when they are not in their own homes. One director told me this week that apparently the government believes Covid is left in the car park of their centre and isn’t allowed through the front door. The directors and managers of the centres also have to juggle staff absences due to positive Covid cases and close contact exposures outside of the centres. But unlike, say, restaurants, they can’t just close their doors if they don’t have enough staff to operate without having an impact on a load of other employees who need the care to turn up for their own jobs. Young human beings can’t just be left without adult care ­– unfortunately for the economy. Ask the parents of the 500 odd centres that have had to close so far how they feel about suddenly being left without care. And then the directors and managers have all the normal issues, like struggling to find food to feed the children in their care given bare supermarket shelves, the need to find RATS on the private market to test their staff, and high-quality masks for the educators that children climb over and hug on a daily basis. Every day they are sent updated information about how they are supposed to operate from the government departments that regulate and fund them. The one thing this information avalanche lacks is clear guidance and support. You hear a lot in the media about school education and whether children should return to school now or later. You hear a lot about the rollout of the vaccination program for children aged from five to 12. You hear about ventilation in schools, or the lack thereof. But you don’t hear much about children under five who are, after all, unable to be vaccinated at all. You don’t hear much about what is happening in the centres that are desperately trying to keep these children safe. You don’t hear much about how our early childhood educators and teachers are faring. You don’t hear much about the RATS that were promised to these centres by governments that haven’t yet arrived. You don’t hear much about how the women (97% of the staff are in fact women) who provide care and education to our youngest children and who manage these centres, for wages that are among the lowest in Australia, are coping. But maybe you should because the answer is “not very well”. We used to have a world where women and children were protected. Apparently that went out about the same time as coughing in public did.

1/14/2022,"Mikel Arteta hailed Arsenal’s “spirit, fight and brotherhood” after they held Liverpool in their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg despite playing with 10 men for well over an hour. Arsenal produced a stirring rearguard action to keep the tie scoreless after Granit Xhaka’s dismissal and give themselves a slight advantage for next week’s return fixture at the Emirates, affording their off-colour hosts few chances. Takumi Minamino missed the best of them, firing over at the death, but Liverpool did not manage a shot on target until stoppage time and would have been flattered to win.  “I’m really proud of what we did today in an extremely difficult stadium, against a great opponent and playing 70 minutes with 10 men,” Arteta said. “When you come to a stadium like this, I said to them you have to pick players who are happy to go to war. You are going to have difficult moments when you suffer. “If you are willing to help your team, willing to accept that in some moments you are not going to play the game you want, then good things are going to happen. When you play with that spirit, fight and brotherhood around the team, in the end you get rewarded. That is what happened today.” Arteta did not offer a firm opinion about Xhaka’s 24th minute red card, brandished swiftly by Michael Oliver after the midfielder had illegally halted Diogo Jota’s run on goal. “I haven’t seen it back but if they checked it, it probably was a red card,” he said. The centre-back Ben White, named man of the match after a dominant display, was more sceptical. “I don’t know, he’s looking at the ball and he doesn’t know where the man is,” White said. Xhaka has now been sent off five times since joining Arsenal in 2016. Although a second leg at home should suit Arsenal, Arteta rejected any idea they are favourites. “We play half-time, even probably less than that and we need another game,” he said. “We have to consider it is positive but we are going to need everyone back and we are going to need a great atmosphere at the Emirates.” Arsenal were already missing nine players before travelling to Merseyside, also losing Cédric Soares and Bukayo Saka to injury during the game. With Xhaka suspended they are down to the bare bones for Sunday’s derby at Spurs and Arteta said the extent of Saka’s issue was unclear. Jürgen Klopp was left to lament a Liverpool performance that stuttered after Xhaka’s departure, with Arsenal’s change to a five-man defence suffocating their attempts to force the issue. “It looked like we were under pressure,” he said. “That makes no sense but that is human. You go out there for winning. It’s difficult against a well-drilled formation. We didn’t create enough, we didn’t do lots of things good enough. But in the end it’s 0-0, half-time, let’s go.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta hails Arsenal’s ‘spirit and brotherhood’ in draw with Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/13/mikel-arteta-hails-arsenals-spirit-after-battling-draw-at-liverpool
1/14/2022,"With around 45 seconds of normal time remaining at Anfield, this feverish and restless semi-final finally had its first real moment of clarity. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, on as a substitute, crossed the ball blindly from the right channel. At the near post, the retreating Albert Sambi Lokonga threw himself at it. Meanwhile, a distracted Aaron Ramsdale flapped indeterminately at the cross, in the first act of a timeline that almost certainly ends with him palming a Kylian Mbappé shot into his own net for England at Qatar 2022.  And so, in the 90th minute, to win the game for Liverpool, Takumi Minamino had a free shot from five yards with no goalkeeper. It’s worth dwelling on how different this night would have felt for both sides had Minamino scored this devastatingly simple chance. For Liverpool, so leaden and meek on the night, it would have been a galvanising moment. For the exhausted 10-man Arsenal it would have been a crushing blow going into Sunday’s derby against Tottenham, the sort that extinguishes all hope in an instant. For Minamino himself, who has scored nine goals in 46 games at Liverpool without ever really seeming to do very much at all, it could have been a goal to ignite his flailing career at Anfield. I suppose the point here is that the universe of football often likes to play nasty little tricks on us. None of the above would really have been fair, in the commonly understood sense (with the possible exception of Minamino, who on the strength of his performance deserved better than to be remembered as the villain of the piece). But you could scarcely argue that Liverpool did enough to win, or that Arsenal did enough to lose. And so perhaps there was a certain brutal poetic justice in the fact that Minamino ended up skewing the ball comically high over the crossbar. It was Liverpool’s 14th shot of a wretched night, and their 14th off target. Such was their dominance of the ball that Alisson in goal ended up having more touches of the ball than all but one of the Arsenal team. Such was their lack of invention and insight that this felt like a curse on the game rather than a gift. Perhaps, in hindsight, and with reluctance, we have to conclude that Granit Xhaka knew what he was doing all along. There were 23 minutes on the clock when Xhaka and Jota both chased down a long ball from Andy Robertson, with very different ideas on how they were going to reach it. “I will take the ball in my stride, use my strength to hold off the defender and fashion a strong shooting opportunity,” thought Jota to himself. “The laws of physics are there to be broken,” muttered Xhaka under his breath. “I am Granit Xhaka. I must karate-kick this ball out of the air. The universe demands nothing less.” Perhaps the most amusing moment of this whole episode was the little waggle of the finger Xhaka gave the referee, Michael Oliver, shortly after he had booted Jota in the solar plexus and shortly before he had been sent off for the offence of denying a clear goalscoring opportunity via martial arts move. It was a gesture that said: look, I know what you’re thinking. And yet in hindsight, Xhaka’s dismissal was the moment the game began to turn in Arsenal’s favour. For Liverpool it awkwardly raised the stakes. They had come out with a strong team and dominated the early stages. Before Xhaka’s red card they were comfortably going to win. Now, somehow, they had to. Meanwhile, Arsenal had the freedom to play on the counterattack, which you suspect is largely Mikel Arteta’s instinct anyway in big games such as this. Eddie Nketiah was sacrificed and Alexandre Lacazette moved up top in a compact 5-3-1 formation. For Arsenal, going down to 10 men instantly transformed this thankless Thursday night pandemic jaunt into a rearguard, a formative crisis, a time for heroes. And so it proved. The last hour of the game was frequently ugly, frequently boring, and for the most part just as Arsenal wanted it. There was still plenty to enjoy: the impish Curtis Jones, who came on as a second-half substitute, the fearless solo running of Bukayo Saka, Ramsdale’s increasingly arresting habit of diving spectacularly even when the ball is nowhere near him. But for the most part it was pretty painful stuff: a reminder that without the razor edge of Mo Salah and Sadio Mané up front, without the gossamer shoes of Thiago Alcântara in midfield, this Liverpool side can look like a terribly blunt instrument. There is always a temptation with these games to wonder whether they really mean very much at all. On the face of things, a rescheduled fixture played by two emaciated teams for English football’s third most prestigious trophy sounds like no one’s idea of a priority. But from the electric atmosphere at kick-off to the desperate slapstick of the closing minutes, no one could be left in any doubt of its significance. After all, for its three remaining sides the 2021-22 Carabao Cup is that rarest of things: a competition without Manchester City in it. That alone makes it more winnable than anything else they will play for this season. And so next week Arsenal and Liverpool will reconvene to do it all over again; both, you sense, with a burning urge to put things right.",Sport/Football,Arsenal seize chance to be heroes after Xhaka red sets up rearguard | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/13/arsenal-seize-chance-to-be-heroes-after-xhaka-red-sets-up-rearguard
1/14/2022,"The arrival of a new offshore drilling rig in New Zealand, a year after the country declared a climate emergency, has prompted a fresh wave of anger at the government’s alleged “hypocrisy” and “cynical politics” on climate change. Keeping fossil fuels in the ground was the most basic element of tackling climate change, Greenpeace said, while #SchoolStrike4Climate movement activist Sophie Handford said allowing more oil and gas extraction was “immoral”.  Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has referred to climate change as her “nuclear-free moment”. In 2018 the government banned the issue of new permits for offshore exploration for oil and gas, and in December 2020 it declared a climate emergency. Existing oil and gas exploration and development permits remain valid, however, and companies can still apply for permits for onshore exploration. “The most basic premise of action on climate change is keeping fossil fuels in the ground,” said Greenpeace spokesperson Adam Currie. “If we can’t do that most basic thing, not only are we failing, we’re failing before the first step.” Handford said “the government needs to put their money and action where their mouth is”.The new offshore drilling rig, run by oil and gas company OMV, will operate under a permit predating the ban. It will be transported to the mature Māui B gas field off the coast of Taranaki in the coming days, where it will complete “development drilling”. In a statement, OMV said the rig would help redevelop the Māui B field and that, “Natural gas is a vital part of the energy mix and a key bridge in the transition to renewable energy sources.” OMV declined to comment regarding the criticism of the project. In a report last year, the International Energy Agency said reductions in gas, oil and coal production would be necessary to limit global warming to 1.5C and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Emily Bailey, a spokesperson for Climate Justice Taranaki, said: “A lot of us are just so sick of this [drilling] … It just props up this crazy economy which is driving us to extinction.” Bailey believed the rig’s arrival showed the government’s climate policy was “weak and insufficient”. Allowing continued oil and gas development is “crazy”, said Currie, who asserted that by not restricting oil and gas drilling, the government was playing “cynical politics, and isn’t doing what is needed to uphold our collective futures”. While it has no immediate protest plans, Greenpeace would not rule out acting against the rig. In November, a group of law students filed a lawsuit in Wellington’s high court against Megan Woods, the minister of energy, after she approved two new onshore oil and gas exploration permits, alleging the decision was inconsistent with the government’s legal obligations under the country’s Zero Carbon Act and the Paris agreement and that she failed to consider key facts such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent warnings about climate change’s severity. Woods has previously declined to comment on the matter in any substance because it is before the courts. Asked about the rig’s arrival, Rilke Comer, a leader of the Students for Climate Solutions group, said, “It just feels like the government doesn’t care about safeguarding our future … On a deep, emotional level, this is really visceral and gutting.” Handford promised that activists would continue to mobilise to oppose further oil and gas extraction, but said: “It makes me sad that we have to keep doing this.” Woods has been approached for comment.",News/World news,New Zealand offshore drilling rig prompts furious backlash from climate activists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/new-zealand-offshore-drilling-rig-prompts-furious-backlash-from-climate-activists
