3/13/2022,"By Elizabeth Piper LONDON (Reuters) - After almost eight hours sitting in a police station and court, Vera Kotova became one of the first people to be judged and fined just under $240 under a new Russian law to punish anyone deemed to have discredited the armed forces. Her crime was writing ""No to war"" accompanied by a heart in the snow at the foot of a statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin in a square in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk during a sparsely attended protest rally. Her punishment, decided by the central district court of Krasnoyarsk, was the 30,000 rouble fine, which she is appealing. The incident went viral on local media and the Telegram messaging app., helped by a video of an unidentified policeman using his foot to rub away the phrase that is now banned in Russia. ""It was one of the first cases under the so-called military censure law about discrediting the army, one of the first court rulings, literally because a person wrote their opinion in the snow, just two words,"" said Kotova's lawyer, Vladimir Vasin. The phrase ""no to war"" in Russian is ""nyet voinye"". The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Contacted late in the day after working hours, the Krasnoyarsk police were not available for comment and the local court could not be reached. On March 4, Russia's parliament passed a law making public actions aimed at ""discrediting"" Russia's army illegal and banning the spread of fake news, or the ""public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"". President Vladimir Putin sent his forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Ukraine and most of the world have denounced that as a false pretext for an invasion of a democratic country. FEAR FOR JOBS, REPRISALS Kotova was fined the 30,000 roubles ($239) but she has yet to pay it, pending appeal. The average monthly wage in Russia is about 78,000 roubles ($621). But she and several other protesters say they fear they have put their and their families' jobs at risk by protesting or expressing doubts over the war, underlining the growing self-censorship the new laws have forced on Russians who criticise or oppose the war. Speaking from Krasnoyarsk, Vasin told Reuters that ""because of those words, as everyone can see, those people who do that are getting arrested...Under the new law, those words are banned. The court does not rule in favour of a person who writes two simple words in the snow"". He said a few days before Kotova's case, two women were fined 150,000 roubles because they had gone for a walk in a square with one wearing a face mask with the phrase on it, the other had the two words on her hat. The two were photographed by a local news site smiling as the left court having received their fines. Their names were not disclosed by the lawyer or the news site. Gauging the extent of support for the war in Ukraine is difficult. State polling agency VTsIOM said Putin's approval rating had risen 6 percentage points to 70% in the week to Feb. 27. FOM, which provides research for the Kremlin, said his rating had risen 7 percentage points to 71% in the same period. But it is increasingly challenging to access or present an alternative view of events in Ukraine. Several liberal Russian media and Western-based broadcasters have suspended operations in Russia to protect their reporters, though Britain's BBC said it was resuming English-language reporting from Russia on March 8 because of the ""urgent need to report from inside Russia"". The law on the ""public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the armed forces of the Russian Federation"" provides for imprisonment for up to 15 years if it caused ""serious consequences"" or a fine of up to 1.5 million roubles. The OVD-info protest-monitoring group, which has for years documented anti-Kremlin protests, said 13,912 people have been detained since the invasion began. OVD-info itself was declared a ""foreign agent"" in September, a label handed to several outlets in a move critics say is designed to stifle dissent, and in December, Russia's communication watchdog blocked its website.

3/13/2022,"Iran launched a dozen ballistic missiles at the Iraqi city of Erbil late Saturday night in the vicinity of an unoccupied American consulate under construction, according to the Associated Press. In a statement released after the attack, the State Department said, “We condemn this outrageous attack and display of violence,” and confirmed that no U.S. personnel or facilities had been damaged. Lawk Ghafuri, a spokesman for the Kurdistan Regional Government, confirmed that 12 missiles had struck Erbil and claimed that they had been launched “from outside Iraq” and produced no casualties. Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi stopped short of attributing the attack but condemned the “aggression which targeted the dear city of Erbil and spread fear amongst its inhabitants.” He called it “an attack on the security of our people” and pledged to investigate it. Social media users in Erbil posted clips of apparent missile strikes in Erbil followed by large explosions. Kurdistan24, a local news channel with a studio near the scene of the strike, also broadcast footage of broken glass and damage at its offices near what the outlet claimed was a missile attack. Iranian-backed militia media outlets quickly claimed that the attack was carried out by Iran using Fateh-110 short range ballistic missiles. Social media users in Iran also posted videos of what appeared to be missiles streaking through the sky in towns and cities near Iran’s border with Iraq. Iran has not claimed responsibility for the attack, and semi official Iranian news outlets have instead amplified claims by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. Fars News, which is close to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, tweeted out clips from Sabreen News, a popular Iranian-backed militia Telegram channel, which noted that security camera footage showed the missiles struck at 1:20 a.m., the same time that missiles from a U.S. drone killed Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. The caption said that the timing was “not accidental at all.” U.S. Strike Kills Iran’s Most Important Military Commander Iran has twice before launched ballistic missiles at Iraqi targets. In September 2018, the IRGC’s Aerospace Force launched short range ballistic missiles at a facility belonging to the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, an armed separatist group that has called for an independent Kurdish homeland in Iran. In January 2020, Iran also attacked U.S. forces with a ballistic missile strike on Al-Asad airbase in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?
