2/8/2022,"In Scott Morrison’s preferred virtual reality Australia would be emerging from a restorative summer of freedom ready to embrace his government’s efforts to tame online trolls by holding big tech to account. In this parallel metaverse the only damaging character assessments in our gaze would be the ones delivered over social media platforms, where vulnerable users have become cannon fodder for a business model that privileges the outrage over the civil.  The government’s determination to keep women and children safe online would be emerging as a political game changer, part of a well-crafted election pitch to keep Australia safe: safe from the trolls, safe from the virus (#missionaccomplished) and safe from China (#dontrisklabor). The hastily convened parliamentary inquiry into online safety held over the summer would have driven the sleepy holiday news cycle with vivid retellings of online pile-ons, orchestrated harassment and platform nonchalance and neglect. While not a partisan battle, a war with an industry that is consistently ranked less trusted than even our politicians would have given the prime minister a forward agenda, directly appealing to anxious parents using the same micro-targeting tools that have given the platforms their power. Strapping on the oculus, the summer would have been loaded up with front-page empathy bombs as sympathetic victims (girls with eating disorders, religious minorities, female public figures) pitched against a weakened Facebook, whose market share is plummeting in the face of falling user numbers, tighter regulation and a collapse in social license. The Omicron outbreak crashed this program, but this week’s Guardian Essential report shows there is broad support for enforcing and imposing more rules on the way social media platforms operate. The radically libertarian values underpinning social media – the brazen assertion they are neutral platforms allowing for the free exchange of ideas – has been mugged by reality. On key issues being canvassed in the inquiry relating to platform responsibility and accountability, three-quarters of voters are on board for greater government intervention. Where there are differences of sentiment it is not in the usual partisan affiliation but between the generations, with older voters significantly more receptive to regulatory intervention and younger people happier to let it all rip. This is politically relevant for a Coalition whose base skews older: in a separate question the issue of online safety emerges as one more likely to hold current voters and, critically, entice people who voted elsewhere in 2019. Our PM, the retail politician par excellence, has been circling online safety for some time influenced by the focus groups picking up this community sentiment that “something must be done” and his own experience with his family. Online safety was to be his global signature, with a landmark speech to be the centrepiece of his G20 appearance last year before French president Emmanuel Macron’s free character assessment derailed the trip. But like all leaders, Morrison’s strengths are also his weakness; when it comes to big tech the government has been all RAM and no ROM. An objective look at the Coalition’s record with big tech would find it has been a scattergun of high-profile political interventions: the creation of an e-safety commissioner to deal with sexting and bullying; emergency takedown laws in response to the Christchurch massacre, the news media bargaining codes at the behest of the major media companies. Wearing my other hat as director of the Australia Institute’s Centre for Responsible Technology, I am a big fan of regulating the platforms. I leaned in behind the Morrison government when it introduced the news media bargaining code in the hope it was the first step in the comprehensive reform agenda that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had laid out in its digital platforms inquiry. But as I argued to the committee, piecemeal “get tough” regulation might be popular but will not bring about the systemic changes required to place public interest parameters around big tech. Like focusing on the skidmarks of a car that continually careers out of control, we focus too much on the point of impact and not enough on the engine design that keeps blowing up in our faces. We need more than tough action on specific activity: we need systemic reform to change how these companies operate. As we argued in our submission to the inquiry, much of the thinking has already been done: the 23 other recommendations from the ACCC’s digital platforms inquiry are waiting for action from the government, an equally groundbreaking Human Rights Commission report on the impact of AI is gathering dust on the attorney general’s desk, reforms to privacy law moves at snail’s pace. The Labor party’s Tim Watts points out in the Burning Platforms podcast that the Centre for Responsible Technology hosts, there are nine discreet regulatory inquiries into big tech currently under way scattered across different portfolios. There are five separate initiatives for age verification currently in train. As Watts says: “This is no way to run a railway.” Here’s the frustration. The public wants change, the detailed policy work has been done. The roadmap to better regulation is set: anti-monopoly intervention, safety by design, privacy reform, platform accountability. Any one of these initiatives would be globally significant; developed in a coordinated and sequenced way they could be transformative. “Anti-trolling” is a politically convenient catchall that justifies any intervention – trolls are naturally bad people, bullying behaviour is abhorrent. But it creates an environment where bad behaviour is personalised and not the natural consequence of current business models that deliberately nudge users to be their worst selves. The idea of taming big tech by wielding the big legislative stick to crack down on trolls makes a great political meme, but the real work of understanding the models, building corporate accountability and imagining alternative models of public infrastructure may be less likely to go viral but is much more important. Like the child trapped in a wormhole, consuming unverifiable content, bouncing from darkened discussion boards to narcissistic performative platforms, this government lacks the focus to brings these threads together.

2/8/2022,"On a cold morning in July 2019, more than 30 Native Hawaiian elders gathered on top of a mountain, committed to getting arrested. “I wasn’t afraid,” says 83-year-old Maxine Kahaulelio. “The moment when the kahea [the call] went out, they said the big machines were coming and they were going to start the desecration … We stood there from 2:30 in the morning … freezing, 9,000 feet above sea level. They had all their gear but we didn’t have anything, just blankets and sweaters.”  Kahaulelio and the others were at the top of Mauna Kea, which at 9,966m (almost 33,000ft) is the world’s tallest mountain from base to height and is considered sacred by Native Hawaiians. The arrests of Hawaiian elders was the climax of a decades-long debate over construction on the mountain, and in Hawaii in general. Some elders have been speaking out against construction on Mauna Kea since the 1970s, when the area began to be used by the University of Hawaii (UH) and government for astronomy purposes due to its lack of light pollution, its above-average number of clear nights and its dry atmosphere which allows more detailed studies. More than a dozen telescopes have been built there in the intervening years. But the project the kūpunas were protesting against was the construction of one of the world’s largest telescopes – the $1.4bn Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) to be built by TMT International Observatory LLC. Supporters of the TMT say it will bring jobs and educational opportunities to the community, through scholarships like the THINK grant, that would provide $1m a year to Hawaii Island students. But for Kahaulelio and other elders, Mauna Kea is considered sacred in the Hawaiian creation story. “It’s like a shrine, our temple,” she says. During the 2019 protest the group of elders were told to move but did not. The standoff continued until law enforcement zip tied the 38 elders’ hands and escorted them to nearby vans. Kahaulelio says the decision to have the elders arrested as opposed to the younger activists was made in a friend’s garage days prior. “We decided we would get arrested because our hearts are burdened by what you folks went through,” she says about younger activists arrested in previous protests. Ana Nawahine Kahoopi’i, 66, says the protests in 2019 that led to her arrest was a sight she’d never seen in her entire life. “There were county police, units from Honolulu and Maui, DLNR [Department of Land and Natural Resources], and the sheriff’s department, they were dressed in riot gear and a sound cannon was being rolled out,” she recalls. The incident brought together leaders in Polynesia and other indigenous communities, along with civil rights activists, lawyers, professors, students and entertainers, all who stood in support of the Native Hawaiian people. Actors such as Jason Momoa, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and artists like Ziggy Marley spoke out in support of Native Hawaiian land rights. The protests lasted for months, with thousands of people visiting the protest site, which eventually gained a daycare, cafeteria and medical tent. So far construction on the TMT has not started, having twice been stopped by protesters. But the UH Board of Regents recently approved a master plan for the area that accommodates the completion of the TMT. For months, Hawaiians and allies stayed on the mountain. When the risk of Covid-19 hit Hawaii’s shores, some from the movement remained on the mountain but many left. But three years later, many of the elders who were arrested are still waiting for their day in court. If convicted, they face a petty misdemeanour charge and 30 days of jail time. In August, a judge dismissed the charges against four of the 38 elders, including in Kahaulelio’s case. “So, we weren’t trespassing; we weren’t blocking any roads. We weren’t doing any harm. Yes, we were in the middle of the road, to what? To stop the desecration for what other people wanted to do for Mauna O Wakea. “This is 2022 and our people are still in court,” she says. Billy Freitas, 64, is one of those still waiting for his trial, but he isn’t hoping for a dismissal. He’s hoping to send a message. “All this effort – sacrificing our job, family, health, why just ask for a dismissal? I want to win this case on merits so that future generations that stand for the Mauna won’t get arrested. That’s where I stand and my attorneys know that,” he says. Luana Neff is baffled that the cases of four kūpunas were dismissed but the other 34 were not. “We’ve been in court for almost three years now and it’s crazy. We asked for a fast and speedy trial and here we are three years later,” she says. In the meantime, she says she will continue to spread awareness about Native Hawaiian land rights. “We’re doing this out of the love of this place, out of the love for our kūpuna, out of the love of our land, and out of the love for Mauna Kea, who houses the largest freshwater aquifer on this planet,” she says.",News/World news,The Hawaiian elders awaiting trial for protesting the world’s largest telescope,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/hawaii-elders-awaiting-trial-for-protesting-worlds-largest-telescope-mauna-kea
