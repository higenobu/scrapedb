1/24/2022,"A Texas woman offered $500,000 to a mother at a Walmart in exchange for her infant son, according to police. Rebecca Lanette Taylor, 49, was charged with the sale and purchase of a child. Taylor is being held at the Houston County Jail on a $50,000 bond. A 49-year-old Texas woman was arrested and charged with a third-degree felony last week after she attempted to buy a child for $500,000 at a Walmart, police said. Rebecca Lanette Taylor was charged last week with the sale and purchase of a child, according to the NBC affiliate KETK-TV. The child was with his mother on the self-checkout line in Crockett, Texas, when a ""white woman with blonde hair approached,"" an affidavit says, according to KETK-TV. The Crockett Police Department did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. It's unclear if Taylor has legal representation, and Insider was unable to reach her for comment. According to police records, Taylor ""began commenting on her son's blonde hair and blue eyes. She asked how much she could purchase him for. (The mom) tried to laugh this comment off, thinking Taylor was joking. Taylor told her that she had $250,000 in the car and she would pay that much for him. (The mom) told her no amount of money would do,"" KETK-TV reported. The mother told police that Taylor was accompanied by another woman, who asked for the child's name. The mother did not tell either of them the name, she told police, but the two women began to call it out, KETK-TV said. Taylor told the mother that she had wanted to purchase a child for a long time. The mother told her to stay away from her child and waited for the two women to leave. Outside in the parking lot, Taylor confronted the mother, once again asking to buy her child. ""Taylor began screaming at (the mom), saying if she wouldn't take $250,000 for him, then she would give her $500,000 because she wanted him and she was going to take him,"" police records obtained by KETK-TV said. The mother got to her car and locked the door with with her child in it. Taylor then got into a black SUV and left the scene, KETK-TV reported. Surveillance footage caught the incident on camera, and police issued a warrant for her arrest. Taylor is being held at the Houston County Jail on a $50,000 bond. The Texas Penal Code says that an individual found guilty of a felony in the third degree ""shall be punished by imprisonment in the institutional division for any term of not more than 10 years or less than two years. In addition to imprisonment, an individual adjudged guilty of a felony of the third degree may be punished by a fine not to exceed $10,000.""

1/24/2022,"A Crystal Cruises ship diverted to the Bahamas in an apparent attempt to escape an arrest warrant. The warrant relates to an unpaid fuel bill, according to case documents obtained by USA Today. A US marshal would be prepared to arrest the ship if it showed up in Miami, per Bloomberg. A Crystal Cruises ship with hundreds of passengers and crew onboard has diverted from its scheduled stop in Miami after an arrest warrant was issued, multiple outlets reported. The Crystal Symphony was due to return to Miami on Saturday, following a 14-day Caribbean voyage, but instead traveled to Bimini in the Bahamas, per The Daily Mail. According to Bloomberg, if the ship docks in Miami, the terms of the warrant would allow it to be seized to repay a $1.2 million unpaid fuel bill, which is apparently owed by its operator, Genting Hong Kong Ltd. The warrant resulted from a lawsuit filed by Peninsula Petroleum Far East Wednesday against Crystal Cruises and Star Cruises Limited, per USA Today. Crystal Cruises did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. One passenger tweeted to travel agent Mundy Cruising: ""Can you help me change my flight to Heathrow from Miami as we are stuck on Crystal Symphony which has changed route and is now heading for Bahamas instead of Miami."" Elio Pace, a musician performing aboard the ship, told the Daily Mail that ""every one of these people are trying to reschedule their flights."" But he noted that ""there's no panic, there's no tantrums going on."" Pace, however, said in an interview with USA Today that he hopes he will be compensated for the additional time he's had to spend onboard. Passengers had to wait overnight Saturday to be transported by a ferry to Fort Lauderdale after the diversion, The Daily Mail reported. Genting Hong Kong filed for provisional liquidation Wednesday, per Bloomberg. It had reported a $1.7 billion loss in May. Cruise companies have faced many difficulties in recent months, particularly in relation to the pandemic. Earlier this month, staff and passengers on Norwegian Getaway and Royal Caribbean ships described their difficult quarantine experiences after contracting COVID-19. Another passenger, who was traveling on an unspecified cruise ship, recently said she experienced ""panic and anxiety"" while isolating for six days in a windowless cabin.
