3/3/2022,"Which stocks are either a fan favorite or a must-avoid? Penny stocks. These tickers going for less than $5 apiece are particularly divisive on Wall Street, with those in favor as well as the naysayers laying out strong arguments. These names are too appealing for the risk-tolerant investor to ignore. Given the low prices, you get more for your money. On top of this, even minor share price appreciation can translate to massive percentage gains, and thus, major returns for investors. However, there is a but here. The critics point out that there could be a reason for the bargain price tag, whether it be poor fundamentals or overpowering headwinds. Based on the above, weeding out the long-term underperformers from the penny stocks going for gold can pose a significant challenge. In this case, the activity of legendary stock pickers can provide some inspiration. Enter billionaire Steven Cohen. The legendary stock picker, who began his investing career at Gruntal & Co. where he managed proprietary capital for 14 years, founded S.A.C Capital Advisors in 1992. In 2014, his investment operations were converted to Point72 Asset Management, a 1,500-plus person registered investment advising firm. Throughout his career, Cohen has consistently delivered huge returns to clients, giving the Point72 Chairman, CEO and President guru-like status on the Street. Turning to Cohen for inspiration, we took a closer look at two penny stocks Cohen’s Point72 made moves on recently. Using TipRanks’ database to find out what the analyst community has to say, we learned that each ticker boasts a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the analyst community and massive upside potential. X4 Pharmaceuticals (XFOR) We’ll start with late-stage biopharma company X4. This firm is working on new orally dosed medications for a variety of rare diseases, mainly primary immunodeficiency conditions. The company is targeting the CRCX4 pathway in its research, as this is an important chemokine pathway, a class of molecular interactions that can stimulate cell migrations – especially of the white blood cells so important to immune function. This is an important distinction for the company’s primary drug candidate, mavorixafor, which offers potential, through its mode of action, to become a broad-based treatment for primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). The drug is currently undergoing several clinical trials, including a Phase 3 trial in the treatment of WHIM syndrome (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis). There are currently no approved or effective treatments for WHIM. In its earlier clinical trials, X4 has shown that mavorixafor demonstrated clinically significant effect in treatment, as well as a tolerable safety profile. The Phase 3 trial completed enrollment of 31 adult and pediatric patients this past October – the trial was originally designed to 18 patients, so the over-enrollment offers a chance for additional data – and top line data is expected in 4Q22. Mavorixafor is also undergoing two Phase 1 trials, in the treatment of chronic neutropenia and in the treatment of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM). The Phase 1 trial on WM has 16 patients enrolled in a dose escalation study, with data expected later this year. Cohen is among those that have high hopes for this healthcare name. Pulling the trigger on X4 for the first time, Point72 purchased more than 1.6 million shares in Q4. The value of the firm’s new holding comes in at over $2.4 million. In coverage for Roth Capital, analyst Zegbeh Jallah points out the high potential of mavorixafor, and writes: “There remains a large unmet need for convenient, chronically dosed therapies, and Mavorixafor could be the holy-grail, being a safe, effective, and convenient option, which physicians are likely to prescribe, decreasing treatment burden and improving patients' quality-of-life. Moreover, a significant advantage of Mavorixafor is that it specifically targets CXCR4, a master regulator of the immune system, thus addressing the root cause of many diseases including WHIM, Waldenstrom, SCN and other PIDs, by increasing white blood cell counts across the board…” ""Overall,"" the analyst added, ""We see a place for Mavorixafor, and ongoing precommercial efforts, which include patient identification, patient diagnostics, U.S. payer research and the intent to hire a CCO in 2022, has us optimistic about its commercial outlook... Mavorixafor seems very appealing from a payer and physician perspective, and approval in WHIM as the initial indication could significantly de-risk its approval in other indications."" To this end, Jallah rates XFOR a Buy, based on his opinion of the lead candidates broad-based potential, and sets a price target of $28, suggesting an enormous upside of 1,766% from current levels. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here) Overall, 4 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been assigned in the last three months. Therefore, the analyst consensus is a Strong Buy. The shares are priced at just $1.50 each, but the average price target of $17.25 implies a 1,050% upside in the next 12 months. (See X4 stock forecast on TipRanks) Harpoon Therapeutics (HARP) The second stock we’ll look at is another biopharma company, Harpoon Therapeutics. Harpoon is focused on clinical stage immunotherapies, developing T cell based medications for use in the treatment of various cancers. The company has a proprietary development platform, called Tri-specific T cell Activating Construct (TriTAC), with which it is creating an active pipeline featuring five drug candidates and three early discovery tracks. The company’s four leading drug candidates are at the Phase 1 clinical trial stage, where they are being investigated as treatments for small cell lung cancer, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer. These are serious cancers, with relatively few effective treatments, and large potential patient bases. In a clinical program update released last month, Harpoon noted that the leading candidate, HPN328, is continuing in the dose escalation portion of the trial. The company aims to have an RP2D determination – that is, an appropriate dose for the expansion stage of the trial – by the end of this year. HPN328 is a potential treatment for small cell lung cancer. The next trial, of HPN217 for the dangerous hematological cancer multiple myeloma, is also nearing completion of the dose escalation stage. Harpoon is working on selecting the RP2D, and aims to initial the dose expansion cohort of the trial during 1H22. Finally, HPN536 and HPN424, which are under investigation as treatments for ovarian cancer and prostate cancer respectively, are both undergoing dose escalation studies with completion expected by the end of 2022. Harpoon has another drug candidate, HPN601, a possible treatment for GI cancers, which is ready to enter the clinical pipeline. The Investigational New Drug (IND) application is expected to be completed for submission by year’s end. With such an active pipeline, it’s no wonder that Harpoon attracted an investor of Steve Cohen’s caliber. Cohen’s Point72 put $2.66 million into the company, to buy up 650,000 shares in Q4. Cohen isn’t the only one bullish here. Truist analyst Asthika Goonewardene gives HARP a Buy rating, with a $16 price target that suggests room for 290% growth in the coming 12 months. (To watch Goonewardene’s track record, click here) Backing this stance, Goonewardene sees HPN328 as the key, and writes: “After seeing the first look at HPN328 in December, where it achieved 1 confirmed PR (in a SCLC patient dose-increased from 1215µg to 3600µg), and 3 more pts with 21%-38% tumor reduction, we are more positive on the asset, especially given no Gr3+ CRS was reported... Updates from Amgen's R&D day [also] bode well for Harpoon's HPN328, in our view. This gives us hope that HPN328 can also show deep responses and clinically meaningful durability in late-line small cell lung cancer (SCLC) - a brutal disease with typically poor outcomes."" ""During our catch up... management stated that they will 'no doubt' have additional data this year (targeting a presentation at a medical meeting rather than their planned R&D day), although they were not sure if it would be a 1H or 2H release,"" the analyst added. Overall, Harpoon gets a Strong Buy from the consensus of Wall Street’s analysts, and it’s unanimous, based on 4 positive reviews. The stock is priced at $4.10, with an average target, $27.33, that implies a one-year upside potential of ~575%.

3/3/2022,"Pretty much everything in life costs money, including financial services. One mutual fund firm - Vanguard, already famous for its relatively low fees - is changing its expense ratios with the aim of returning a total of $1 billion in fees to its customers by 2025. This could impact you if you use Vanguard products or plan to in the future, so read on to get a fuller picture of the changes Vanguard is making - and if it could lead to more money in your account. For help with minimizing fees or any other personal finance issues, consider finding a professional to work with using SmartAsset's free financial advisor matching service. What Action Is Vanguard Taking? Vanguard announced that it was changing the expense ratio on 18 funds. The total deductions range from 1 basis point to 6 basis points. Some funds did see an increase in expense ratio, ranging from 1 basis point to 50 basis points. A basis point is equal to one one-hundredth of one percent, so a one basis point reduction is equal to a fee reduction of 0.1%. While that may seem like small potatoes, when you're talking about huge funds, the savings adds up. According to Vanguard's press release announcing this change, these changes will result in $34.2 million for investors. The fund seeing the biggest cuts are the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF and the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Admiral Shares, both of which are going down by six basis points. The fund seeing the biggest increase is the Vanguard Alternative Strategies Fund, an increase of 50 basis points. No other fund's expense ratio is increasing by more than a single basis point. Alternative strategies tend to be more complicated and require more work from fund managers, resulting in generally higher expense ratios. Why Is Vanguard Making These Changes? Vanguard, founded by Jack Bogle, is firm that essentially created index investing - creating funds that track stock indexes like the S&P 500 rather than employing a fund manager to make stock picks. Eliminating the need for stock picking allowed Vanguard to set expense ratios very low from the start, and it became synonymous with low-cost, index-focused investing. While other firms have since added index funds and worked to lower costs, Vanguard is sort of like the ""OG"" of low-cost investing. In 2019, Vanguard announced it was looking to take even more steps to lower the cost and eliminate the entry barrier to the world of investing, planning to cut fees by a total of $1 billion by 2025. As of February 2022, the firm has cut fees by a total of around $450 million, meaning the plan is to eliminate a further $650 million by 2025. Why Expense Ratios Matter Investing isn't easy, and there are a lot of details that some investors don't have the time to deal with. One thing that some novice investors don't account for is the expense ratio their mutual fund investments carry. There are plenty of stories of investors putting money into a fund and being shocked when a decent chunk of their earnings and investment are swallowed up by fees. If you're investing through a financial advisor or a 401(k) especially, there could be several layers of fees that pile up, leaving many investors wondering if it is even worth it to be in the investing games. Lower fees such as the ones Vanguard is offering could, in theory, encourage more novice and lower-net-worth investors to become involved in the market, meaning more people can benefit from economic growth rather than just rich people. The Bottom Line Vanguard is continuing its mission to cut $1 billion in expense ratio fees by 2025, cutting expense ratios on 18 funds and saving investors more than $32 million. The total saved by fee cuts since 2019 was around $450 million as of February 2022, with a further $650 million to come.

3/3/2022,"There are plenty of fundamentally sound, low cost stocks out there for retail investors to consider. The key to success is to find stocks that are at or near the bottom of their cycle. Equity investment advisors will always tell you that ‘timing the market’ is impossible, and they’re right – but timing is still important for success. Investors need to buy into low prices, and to do that, they need to know when prices are low. This doesn’t necessarily mean low in absolute dollar terms, but low relative to a stock’s recent past performance. In recognizing that lower price range, investors can turn to Wall Street’s pros for help. The analysts have been busy lately, picking out stocks that are in their lower price range, and are flirting with the bottom. We’ve used the TipRanks database to look up three such stocks, Strong Buys with strong upside potential for the next few months – and each one is trading at or near its one-year low. Let’s take a closer look. Oportun Financial Corporation (OPRT) We’ll start in the financial services sector. Oportun is a digital banking platform that uses AI to back up inclusive, affordable financial services for more than 1.5 million members. The company’s customers can access savings, banking, investing services, including short-term loans and credit. The company offers alternatives to high-risk credit services such as payday and auto-title loans; Oportun’s customers can access personal loans between $300 and $10,000 with repayment terms between 1 and 4 years, and can apply for credit cards with limits between $300 and $1,000. Oportun has been in business since 2009, and in that time provided over $12 billion in affordable credit. Personal banking and credit services targeted at the lower end of the consumer financial market has become big business, and a look at Oportun’s recent performance bears this out. The company reported $194 million in quarterly revenue for 4Q21, and the quarter’s aggregate loan originations rose 93% to $865 million. For the full year 2021, these numbers reached $627 million and $2.3 billion – both company records. The company reported adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share, up 36% year-over-year, and well above the 72-cent forecast. Nevertheless, Oportun’s share price has fallen by 46% from the peak it reached in November of last year. This doesn't mean that the stock is unsound. 5-star analyst David Scharf, of JMP, takes an upbeat view of Oportun, writing: “Exiting 2021, we believe that Oportun represents one of the best positioned and most compelling growth stories in our Consumer Finance coverage... Our sense is that the company’s significant geographic, product, and channel expansion over the course of the past two years has been lost amid the broader investor focus on the pandemic and the related credit normalization that is underway. Yet OPRT’s management has been quietly and steadily building a diverse and comprehensive subprime platform…” Backing his optimistic view of the company, Scharf assigns the shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $26 price target implies a robust upside of ~72% for the coming year. (To watch Scharf’s track record, click here) Overall, all 4 of the recent analyst reviews on OPRT are positive, making a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, and the $26.25 average price target indicates potential for ~74% upside from the trading price of $15.11. (See OPRT stock forecast on TipRanks) Altra Industrial Motion (AIMC) We may live under the digital economy, and the financial and cyberspace sectors may drive much of what happens around us, but the physical world makes demands that cannot be avoided – and that is where Altra Industrial Motion comes in. This company manufactures motion control and power transmission products, for a wide range of sectors: cranes and hoists, the oil and gas industry, robotics and factory automation, precision motors, and medical and surgical tools. Altra produces a full range of equipment to control speed, torque, positioning, and braking, at every scale imaginable. The company operates in 17 countries and has over 48 production facilities. In its most recent quarter, 4Q21, Altra reported $469.8 million at the top line, flat sequentially but up a modest 3.7% year-over-year. While sales were slightly up, EPS was down. The reported non-GAAP earnings, at 67 cents per share, were down almost 12% y/y. On a positive note, the company also reported a record backlog, indicating high potential for future business, and guided toward full-year 2022 revenue in the range of $2.025 billion to $2.065 billion – which would translate to a 7.6% y/y gain at the midpoint. In a couple of recent organizational moves, Altra has taken action to emphasize its strengths and shed some weaknesses. The company entered an agreement to sell its JVS (Jacobs Vehicle Systems) business to Cummins for $325 million. This sale price was 40% higher than JVS’ share of the 2021 revenues. And, in January, Altra completed its acquisition, for an undisclosed sum, of Nook Industries, a leader in engineered linear motion. Nook showed approximately $42 million in revenue last year. Altra shares have been falling steadily for the past 12 months; the stock is down 32% in that period. However, Oppenheimer's 5-star analyst Bryan Blair points out the stock’s potential for a rebound, saying: “We believe valuation now excessively discounts Altra's business quality (including the fourth-highest EBITDA margins across IMFC coverage), the favorable positioning of its overall portfolio (with underappreciated exposure to factory automation, material handling/e-commerce, infrastructure, and medical technologies), and the through-the-cycle earnings power of combined PTT/A&S operations (supporting normalized FCF generation solidly >$250M). We view the stock's eye-catching valuation discount (notably >10 points on P/E) as disconnected from fundamentals, highlighting AIMC as a compelling value play."" To this end, Blair gives AIMC an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a $67 price target that suggests an upside of 63% over the next 12 months. (To watch Blair’s track record, click here) While only three analysts have weighed in on Altra, their unanimous agreement gives the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $41.23 and have an average target of $65, for ~58% upside potential in the next 12 months. (See AIMC stock forecast on TipRanks) Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA) We’ll wrap up with another industrial stock, this one in something of a ‘leisure/luxury’ niche. Axalta, headquartered in Philadelphia, has produced and marketed a wide range of color and coating solutions for industrial and consumer use for the past 150 years. The company is particularly noted as provider of automotive coatings – paint jobs – but its full product line includes liquid and powder coatings for vehicles in the commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors as well. In the past year, Axalta has seen revenues rise while earnings came under pressure. The company’s top line hit $1.14 billion in 4Q21, up 6% year-over-year and the best result in two years. For 2021 as a whole, revenues were reported at $4.42 billion, an 18% gain over the ‘COVID year’ of 2020, and indicative of a solid recovery. At the same time that revenue numbers are up, earnings have been slipping in recent quarters. Q4’s 30-cent adjusted EPS was down by almost half from the 58-sent EPS reported in the year-ago quarter. As a result, Axalta’s shares are down 20% so far this year. All may not be gloom for this industrial paint company, however, as BMO analyst John McNulty writes: “Conservative expectations/estimates, pricing accelerating while raw materials level, and continued strength in its end-markets, have AXTA poised to deliver in the near term. With a thin valuation, this execution should yield solid upside in the stock and help AXTA to 'break out' of the perpetual upper $20s/low $30s range it has held for the last five years. The risk/reward remains one of the most compelling in the sector…” Unsurprisingly, McNulty rates AXTA an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $40 price target shows the stock’s potential for ~53% upside in the months ahead. (To watch McNulty’s track record, click here) Axalta is a high-profile company, and has picked up 9 analyst reviews in recent weeks. These break down to 7 Buys and 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy analyst consensus. AXTA shares are selling for $26.13 and have an average price target of $35.56, giving the stock ~36% upside potential.

3/3/2022,"By Sabrina Valle HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil on Tuesday said it would exit Russia oil and gas operations that it has valued at more than $4 billion and halt new investment as a result of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The decision will see Exxon pull out of managing large oil and gas production facilities on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East, and puts the fate of a proposed multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility there in doubt. ""We deplore Russia's military action that violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine and endangers its people,"" the company said in a statement critical of the intensifying military attacks. Its planned exit follows dozens of other Western companies ranging from Apple and Boeing to BP PLC, Shell and Norway's Equinor ASA that have halted business or announced plans to abandon their Russia operations. Exxon, which is scheduled to meet with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday, did not provide a timetable for its exit, nor comment on potential asset writedowns. Its Russia assets were valued at $4.055 billion in its latest annual report, filed in February. Earlier, Exxon began removing U.S. employees from Russia, two people familiar with the matter said. The number of staff being evacuated was unclear. The company sent a plane to Sakhalin Island to retrieve staff, one of the people said. Exxon operates three large offshore oil and gas fields with operations based on Sakhalin Island on behalf of a consortium of Japanese, Indian and Russian companies that included Russia's Rosneft. The group had been advancing plans to add a LNG export terminal at the site. ""Exxon's Russian business is relatively small in the context of its wider enterprise, so it does not have the same significance as it has to BP or TotalEnergies, if it were to abandon its Russian assets,"" said Anish Kapadia, a director at energy and mining researcher Pallissy Advisors. The company, which has been developing its Russian oil and gas fields since 1995, had come under pressure to cut its ties with Russia over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". The Sakhalin facilities, which Exxon has operated since production began in 2005, represents one of the largest single direct investments in Russia, according to a project description on Exxon's website. The operation recently has pumped about 220,000 barrels per day of oil. India's ONGC Videsh, which owns a 20% stake in the Sakhalin-1 project, said the partners will decide over the next few weeks on how to keep operating the project after exit, the Indian company told Reuters in an emailed statemnt. Rosneft holds a 20% stake in the project. The overseas investment arm of India's top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp also said it did not see ""any immediate impact"" on the operation of the project due to Exxon's decision. Japan's Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development (SODECO), which owns a 30% stake in the Sakhalin-1 project, is trying to confirm details of Exxon's announcement, a spokesperson said, adding that it will keep an eye on the Russia-Ukraine situation and decide what to do in the future. State-backed oil producer Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (Japex), which owns 15.285% in SODECO, is also checking details of the Exxon's announcement and will talk to its partners to decide a future plan, a Japex spokesperson said.

3/3/2022,"Oil is up, the Russian ruble is down, and financial markets are showing increased levels of volatility. The rolling boil in the markets comes as Russia’s Vladimir Putin has launched the largest ground war in Europe since the Second World War.

Plenty of companies send out a dividend but only a select group attract the attention of serious dividend investors. These are the stocks that pay out the highest yielding dividends with the most reliable payment histories. In turbulent times like these, the market’s dividend champions are sure to get a second look from investors. Bearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks' database to zero-in on two stocks that are showing high dividend yields – on the order of 8%. Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts. Brigham Minerals (MNRL) One of the biggest economic sectors to feel the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine fighting is the energy sector. Russia is a major hydrocarbon exporter, and has not been shy about using its energy clout in foreign policy. In the lead-up to the Ukraine crisis, Russia has been building the Nordstream 2 pipeline, a natural gas pipeline to Germany that bypasses Ukraine. While the ins and outs of the project and its impact on international relations are beyond the scope of this article, it may be of interest to take a look into the US hydrocarbon sector. And there we’ll find Brigham Minerals. Based in Austin, Texas, Brigham is a mineral and royalty interest acquisition company – that is, it buys up land holdings and the rights to resource exploitation thereon, and collects royalties on the oil and gas extracted from those lands. Brigham’s portfolio includes land holdings some of the richest resource basins in the lower 48, including the Williston of North Dakota, the DJ of Colorado/Wyoming, the Scoop/Stack of Oklahoma, and the Midland and Delaware of Texas and New Mexico. Brigham's operating model differentiates it from its peers, focusing as it does on maximizing royalties. The company directs its purchases to just 5 ‘tier one’ regions, with proven hydrocarbon output; leases its holdings to a diverse group of well-capitalized operational firms; and focuses solely on land purchases and royalty acquisitions, avoiding any expenses for lease development or operations. This strategy has been successful for the company, and in its last quarterly report, for 4Q21, Brigham showed over $47 million at the top line, a company record. It was also the sixth quarter in a row with a sequential revenue gain. In a key metric for dividend investors, Brigham finished the quarter with $27.7 million in discretionary cash flow to fund the dividend. The dividend was paid out as both a base – of 14 cents per common share – and variable dividend, of 31 cents. The company uses the variable dividend to adjust total payment to make up 80% of discretionary cash flow. The combined dividend marked the sixth consecutive quarter that the payment increased for common shareholders. In Q4, Brigham paid out a total dividend of 45 cents per common share. At that payment, the dividend annualizes to $1.80 and yields 8%. Even more important for dividend investors, however, is Brigham’s forward guidance. The company anticipates royalty-generating production increasing on its holdings by 25% in the coming year, allowing for an increase in the base dividend of 2 cents per share. With the usual variables added to it, this should create a windfall for dividend investors. RBC’s 5-star analyst TJ Schultz notes the bullish dividend outlook, and writes, “At ~80% payout levels we see a path to >$2.00/share in dividends in 2022 (implying a ~10% forward dividend yield). This keeps us constructive on the story; we like MNRL for its diversified exposure to core basins amid strong commodity prices, attractive yield, and disciplined acquisition strategy…” To this end, Schultz rates MNRL an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $30 price target implies a one-year upside potential to the stock of ~32%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~40% potential total return profile. (To watch Schultz’s track record, click here) Brigham’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a 4 to 1 split favoring the Buys over the Holds, while the average price target of $27.20 indicates room for ~19% upside from the share price of $22.78. (See MNRL stock forecast on TipRanks) Trinity Capital (TRIN) With the next up, Trinity Capital, we’ll shift our focus. Trinity works with venture debt, making new capital available to start-up companies. While risky, this activity is essential for the economy, as it’s the funding engine for the ‘tip of the spear,’ the innovative companies that will define the economic future. Trinity, which went public in February of last year, has provided more than $1.5 billion in funding for over 175 companies in its lifetime. In the year since it entered the public markets, Trinity has shown rising revenues and steadily increasing share price. At the top line, the company reported $22.5 million in 3Q21, the last reported, and the stock is up 29% since the IPO. Trinity will report its 4Q and full year 2021 results on March 3. In a bit of preview of the Q4 results, Trinity has already reported new fundings for the last quarter. The company originated some $248 million in ‘gross debt and equity commitments’ during the quarter, making its total funding commitments for 2021 an impressive $757 million. The Q4 originations included $121 million to 11 new companies in the portfolio, along with $76.5 million to 14 existing portfolio companies. Trinity generates income through the return on its investments, specifically, the loan repayments and interest, and the company in its own turn returns these profits to its shareholders through a common share dividend payment. The upshot is, Trinity has increased its dividend in each of the last four quarters, with the last declaration, in December 2021, being 36 cents per share, or 9% higher than the 3Q21 payment. At the current payment, the dividend annualizes to $1.44 and gives an 8% yield. All of this has caught the attention of B. Riley analyst Sarkis Sherbetchyan, who writes: “We raise our NII per share estimates across the board to reflect robust net originations and meaningfully higher earning assets compared to our previous model... We reason TRIN’s NII growth and recent proceeds from the monetization of equity investments provide the board with ample room to continue raising distributions to shareholders… We appreciate TRIN’s internally managed structure, growth potential for NII and dividends, as well as its valuation relative to the closest venture debt lending peers, which have historically traded at premiums compared to the broader BDC universe.” In line with this upbeat outlook, Sherbetchyan sets a Buy rating on TRIN shares, and bumps his price target up to $20.50, suggesting a 12-month upside of 15%. (To watch Sherbetchyan’s track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent analyst reviews of this stock, and they all agree that it’s a Buying proposition, making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are selling for $17.80 and their $20.50 average price target matches Sherbetchyan’s objective.

3/3/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K.-listed depositary receipts of Russian companies are evaporating in value as sanctions take effect.

The slump has wiped out $572 billion from the market value of 23 stocks, including Gazprom PJSC, Sberbank of Russia PJSC and Rosneft PJSC, according to Bloomberg calculations. Wednesday’s continuing selloff triggered a wave of volatility halts. Within the first four hours of trading, dealing was briefly paused at least 15 times for lender Sberbank, state-run gas giant Gazprom and retailer Magnit PJSC. Trading in VTB Bank PJSC was suspended last week following sanctions. The Dow Jones Russia GDR gauge, which tracks 11 of the largest Russian companies listed in London, fell as much as 81% Wednesday, taking a decline since Feb. 16 to 98%. Depositary receipts for Sberbank have slumped 99% this week, while Gazprom fell 98% and steel producer Severstal PJSC lost almost 100%. Rosneft Oil Co. tumbled 79% and Lukoil PJSC sank 99%. Europe is carving up Sberbank’s business in the region after sanctions sparked by President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine prompted a run on its local deposits. Meanwhile, European energy companies are distancing themselves from Gazprom, with Shell Plc and Italy’s Eni SpA ending joint ventures. With the Russian central bank taking the unusual step of closing stock trading on the Moscow exchange, the movement in shares of Russian firms listed elsewhere is an indication of how local equities may react to the sanctions once it eventually resumes. The three-day shuttering of stock trading is the longest closure for extraordinary circumstances since October 1998, according to the bourse. Russia Keeps Stock Market Closed in Longest Pause Since 1998 The exodus out of Russian equities listed abroad may continue, with equity index operator Stoxx planning to drop 61 Russian companies from its indexes on March 18.

3/3/2022,"Wall Street is beginning to weigh in on Ford's major transformation unveiled on Wednesday — so far the feedback supports the legion of newly formed Ford bulls. The auto giant announced it would create two distinct internal teams: Ford Blue and Ford Model e. The maneuver is designed to free up resources so Ford could better attack the opportunity in EVs. Ford Blue — essentially the company's gas-powered auto business — will be focused on managing profits. That means attention on lowering costs, and plowing those savings into the EV Ford Model e division. ""This announcement is another encouraging proof point of action in the company's Ford+ Strategy outlined earlier this year, and adds to a list of positive announcements made by the company in recent months, including plans to double production capacity of the F-150 Lighting and its joint investment with SK Innovation to create EV plants,"" Bank of America auto analyst John Murphy said in a note. ""Sometimes two is better than one with a shock to the system."" Murphy reiterated his Buy rating on Ford and $30 price target, assuming 67% upside from current levels. ""Our legacy business has been holding us back,"" Farley said on a livestream presentation to media and analysts. Shares of Ford popped 7% to $17.86. Ford also outlined $3 billion in cost savings from Ford Blue by 2026. The company expects to produce 2 million EVs by 2026. It sees an adjusted operating profit margin of 10% by 2026, up 270 basis points from 2021. ""We continue to believe Ford is starting to hit a more sustainable inflection in earnings, driven by the combination of a favorable product cadence in the US/NA market; redesign efforts; and a real push into electrification, autonomy, connectivity, and other future businesses,"" Murphy added. In total, Ford guided to a $50 billion in EV investment through 2026. ""We are going all in,"" Farley said. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

3/3/2022,"Maersk joins global shipping boycott cutting off Russia Explainer: How the West's sanctions are hurting Russia FTSE 100 slides 1.7pc as Ukraine jitters linger Ambrose Evans-Pritchard: It is time to drop an energy cluster bomb on the Kremlin Sign up here for our daily business briefing newsletter​ The Swiss-based company building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany has fired all 106 staff after being targeted US sanctions. The German government moved to halt approval for the $11bn (£8.2bn) pipeline last week before President Joe Biden then directed his administration to impose sanctions on the operating company. In a further blow, major backer Shell announced it would pull out of the project. The Gazprom-owned company denied reports it had filed for bankruptcy. That's all from us today, thank you for reading - we will see you tomorrow. Before you go, have a look at the latest stories from our reporters: Maersk joins global shipping boycott cutting off Russia Cafe closures threaten 2,000 Sainsbury's jobs British energy firm ready to start selling gas to Russia's Gazprom Gambling crackdown will destroy growth for bookies, warns Sky Bet boss YouTube blocks Russia Today in UK and rest of Europe Grocery price inflation hit 4.3pc in February, according to data from Kantar, as it warned further pain was likely owing to the potential impact of the conflict in Ukraine. Hannah Boland reports: Aside from a spike in prices at the start of the pandemic when supermarkets cut promotions to prevent stockpiling, February's inflation rate is the fastest Kantar has recorded since September 2013. Although prices for items grew, supermarket sales as a whole were down 3.7pc over the 12 weeks to February 20. Kantar said it had found more families were turning to own-label brands last month than they have since the start of December. Households spent on average £26.07 less at supermarkets in February. Aldi and Lidl were the strongest performers in the period, both increasing sales by 3.3pc, as squeezed households hunted for bargains. Ocado was the only other supermarket to record a rise in sales during the period, as they edged up 0.2pc. Morrisons was the worst performer, recording an 8.2pc fall in sales, followed by the Co-op and Iceland, where sales fell 8pc and 7.9pc respectively. Asda recorded a 5.5pc fall, while Sainsbury's posted a 4.1pc drop. At Waitrose, sales were 3.4pc lower and by 2.6pc at Tesco. European coal surged to historic highs as sanctions against Russia tighten the global market, driving traders to look elsewhere for the commodity. The sanctions have triggered intense concerns over the ability of European utilities to get their hands on coal from Russia, which supplies more to the region than any other country. Even with the continent’s coal stockpiles at a historic low, high natural gas prices mean it’s still more profitable to burn coal than gas to produce power. Benchmark annual futures have jumped as much as 32pc to $200 a ton today, the highest since 2008. Month-ahead prices rose as much as 38pc to hit a record high of $322.50. BMW has joined Volkswagen in warning of production outages because Russia’s war in Ukraine is disrupting car-parts supplies from the country, adding on manufacturers' woes. Companies were already facing significant parts bottlenecks and fallout from the pandemic, and some had been forced to curb production over the past year because of a chronic shortage of computer chips. VW will idle some production lines in Wolfsburg, the world’s largest car plant, next week before a broader shutdown the following week. BMW expects temporary shutdowns because of parts shortages, and will suspend vehicle exports as well as local assembly in Russia because of the invasion. Nvidia, the US microchip giant, has alerted authorities after hackers stole employees’ login details and began leaking them online. James Titcomb has more: The company confirmed it had been hit by a cyber attack, as The Telegraph revealed on Friday, but said it had “no evidence” linking the incident to Russia and Ukraine. It has hired experts at the cyber security company Mandiant to investigate the hack. “On February 23, 2022, Nvidia became aware of a cybersecurity incident which impacted IT resources. Shortly after discovering the incident, we further hardened our network, engaged cybersecurity incident response experts, and notified law enforcement,” the company said. Read the full story here The FTSE 100 has fallen as the worsening Ukraine crisis pushed shares of heavyweight banking and Russia-exposed miners lower, while Flutter Entertainment dropped on downbeat earnings. The blue-chip index ended 1.7pc lower at 7,330, with HSBC , Prudential, Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays among the biggest drags. Yields on UK bonds - both longer and shorter-dated - dropped as investors sought safe investments. Russia-exposed miners Polymetal and Evraz tumbled further, paving the way for the shares to drop out of the blue-chip index at this month's quarterly review. EU countries are considering a ban on Russian ships entering the bloc's ports. The aim is to tighten sea restrictions after a halt on air traffic, European officials say, a step that would further hamper Russia's commercial shipments. The UK already decided yesterday to deny entry to British ports to all ships that are Russian owned, operated, controlled, chartered, registered or flagged. With tighter global energy supplies, cutting off such shipments poses a challenge for Europe, which joined the US and other allies in imposing an array of sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". China’s energy and industrial giants are steering clear of Russian coal over fears supplies will be caught up in the barrage of Western sanctions. Tom Rees writes: Banks in China have warned firms that Western restrictions could cause “unexpected damage” to importers of Russian coal as they curb funding for commodities bought from the sanctions-battered country. It came as prices for coal in Europe soared on fears that Russian supply will be disrupted, leaving few alternative sources of the fuel for many EU countries. At least two of China’s biggest state-owned banks are cutting off financing for Russian commodities as lenders and traders mull the impact of the country’s ejection from the Swift global payments messaging system, according to Bloomberg. Beijing has been reluctant to support Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine, abstaining from voting on a UN Security Council draft resolution telling Russia to stop the attack despite their close ties. China is Russia’s biggest coal export market, buying more than $7bn of the energy source last year. The list of companies dropping Russian operations is getting longer as major Hollywood entertainment companies are pausing the releases of new films. Disney has put on hold the debut of the new Pixar movie “Turning Red”, which is making its debut in the US on the Disney+ streaming service next week. WarnerMedia, a division of AT&T, said it would delay the introduction of “The Batman” a installment of the DC Comics franchise starring Robert Pattinson as the titular superhero, which is expected to be one of the year’s highest-grossing pictures. Sony Pictures Entertainment said it paused planned theatrical releases in Russia, including that of “Morbius” a Spider-Man spin-off starring Jared Leto. Paramount Pictures will also delay the debuts of its films “The Lost City” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 2”. That's all from me today – thanks for following! Handing over to Giulia Bottaro now. Two Russian miners are likely to be relegated in the latest FTSE reshuffle as the war in Ukraine upends markets and sanctions take their toll. Polymetal International has suffered a dramatic plunge in recent days, losing 75pc of its market value since the conflict broke out. Evraz, whose biggest shareholder is Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, has tumbled 55pc over the last five days. The losses mean the two Russia-exposed firms are likely to drop down into the FTSE 250 when the rejig is confirmed tomorrow. They're likely to be replaced by Endeavour Mining, which has benefited from surging gold prices during the Ukraine crisis. Howden Joinery, a major winner from the housing boom, is also tipped to join the top-flight index. Question marks remain over budget airline easyJet, though. It had been hotly tipped to join the FTSE 100 but has seen its path blown off course by omicron and airspace bans. The US and other major consumer nations are said to have agreed to start a coordinated release of oil stockpiles after Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove prices above $100. The International Energy Agency, which represents countries including the US, UK, Germany and Japan, has agreed to deploy 60m barrels from stockpiles around the world, Bloomberg reports. It would be the second release from US reserves in only a few months as President Joe Biden battles to keep a lid on surging prices. Benchmark Brent crude jumped above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014 last week as the outbreak of war sparked fears of supply disruption. West Texas Intermediate touched a seven-year high earlier today. Ukraine has raised 8.1bn hryvnia (£201m) through the sale of war bonds as it looks to drum up more funds to support its defence against Russia's invasion. The bond auctions is one of a number of crowdfunding efforts by Ukrainian authorities to raise money for both its armed forces and civilians. It's also taken to social media to ask for cryptocurrency donations. Ukraine's finance ministry announced the sale of war bonds yesterday, saying: ""In the time of military aggression of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Finance offers citizens, businesses and foreign investors to support the budget of Ukraine by investing in military government bonds."" The Ministry of Finance has placed military bonds worth UAH 8.1 billion.Thank you for participation! #UkraineWillResist 🇺🇦✊🏼 pic.twitter.com/R0e426oEp1 — MinFin UA (@ua_minfin) March 1, 2022 The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq have halted trading of shares in Russia-based companies listed on their exchanges. The halts were due to regulatory concerns as the exchanges seek more information following economic sanctions imposed on Russia, Reuters reports. The Nasdaq-listed stocks halted are Russian Google rival Yandex, Amazon equivalent Ozon, payments services firm Qiwi and recruiter HeadHunter Nasdaq also halted video game maker Nexters, which is based in Cyprus. Trading in Cian, Mechel and Mobile TeleSystems was suspended on the NYSE. The owner of British Gas has said it plans to exit its gas supply agreements with Russian companies, most notably Gazprom. Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, said the company would do this ""as a matter of urgency"". He added: ""We are shocked by the events unfolding in Ukraine and the needless loss of lives."" Centrica said it's working through the details of how best to do this and will make sure it complies with all relevant sanctions. It comes after oil giants BP and Shell both announced plans to withdraw from Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine. But Vladimir Putin has rolled out a ban on foreign investors ditching Russian assets in a bid to halt an exodus in the wake of the crisis. The UK has banned Russia's largest lender Sberbank from correspondent banking and sterling clearance as it steps up sanctions after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last week. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Monday she would freeze the assets of all Russian banks, while bringing forward a legislation that would prevent them from clearing payments in sterling. Wall Street's three main indices slipped at the opening bell as continued worries over Russia and Ukraine roil markets. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both fell 0.3pc, while the Dow Jones lost 0.2pc. Archegos Capital Management is said to be in talks with global banks to avoid a legal battle that would expose details of the deals that led to the family office's meltdown last year. The potential legal battle is focused on billions of dollars of swaps contracts agreed between the banks and Archegos at a time when the practice of block trading has come under regulatory scrutiny in the US, the Financial Times reports. Archegos collapsed in March last year after its highly-leveraged stock bets went sour. The family office run by Bill Hwang defaulted on margin calls, triggering losses of up to $10bn that sent shockwaves through Wall Street. Sainsbury's has said it will shut 200 cafes in a shake-up of its in-store dining that's set to hit around 2,000 employees. The supermarket chain also said it is launching consultations with an undisclosed number of staff regarding plans to close less popular hot food counters in 34 stores and changes to how it runs bakeries in 54 stores. It is the latest in a raft of recent restructuring moves by the retailer as it seeks to keep a lid on rising costs. Sainsbury's told staff at its cafes that it is proposing to close 200 sites in the spring. It said that workers affected by the closures will be prioritised for vacant roles in stores and will be encouraged to apply for jobs elsewhere in the business. The remaining 67 in-store cafes will stay open while the company reviews changes to its dining operations. German inflation rose again in February as the war in Ukraine added to fears that prices will stay higher for longer. Consumer prices rose by 5.1pc year on year last month, according to the latest official figures. That came after the pace slowed in January to 4.9pc. The renewed rise dashes previous expectations that inflation would progressively ease after reaching a decades-high peak of 5.3pc in December. Statistics body Destatis said the continued squeeze on prices was down to ""Covid-19-related effects such as delivery bottlenecks"", while ""energy product prices continue to have an impact"". It added that long-running pressures had been ""superimposed by uncertainties caused by the Russian attack on Ukraine"", which threatens to further increase the price for energy. Harley-Davidson has become the latest company to halt business with Russia as western sanctions step up a gear. The iconic motorbike brand said it's suspended business and shipments of its bikes to the country following its invasion of Ukraine. It comes after Jaguar Land Rover this morning said it was pausing deliveries of vehicles to Russia. General Motors and Daimler Truck have also done the same. As the war in Ukraine escalates, companies with ties to Russia are increasingly feeling the heat. The 19 London-listed firms with more than 5pc exposure to Russia have had £50bn wiped off their market valuation. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, points out that more than two-thirds of their value has evaporated since the start of the year. They now account for less than 1pc of all London stocks. Staggering loss of market capitalisation amongst the 19 London-listed public companies with >5% Russian exposure.

West Texas Intermediate climbed as much as 6.1pc in New York trading to hit $101.53 a barrel – its highest since 2014. Benchmark Brent crude jumped by more than $6 to above $104 a barrel. It reached its highest in seven years last week, at just shy of $106. A British energy producer is to sell gas to an arm of Russia’s state gas giant Gazprom despite growing pressure on companies to cut ties to the Kremlin, writes Rachel Millard. London-listed Independent Oil and Gas struck a deal in July to sell gas from its fields in the southern North Sea to Gazprom Marketing and Trading. It comes as both Shell and BP said they would both sell out of their interests in Russia in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. IOG said it would expect to find another buyer for its gas if the Gazprom subsidiary was hit with sanctions, the Financial Times first reported on Tuesday. IOG was one of the companies which received investment from London Capital and Finance, the mini-bond seller which collapsed in 2019 owing about £237m to nearly 12,000 investors. Read Rachel's full story here Alongside the ban on foreign investors selling assets, Russia is also preparing to divert billions of dollars to prop up its own companies. The country's huge sovereign wealth fund will spend up to 1 trillion roubles ($10.3bn) to buy shares in Russian firms. The Kremlin is desperately battling to mitigate the impact of sanctions, which have driven the rouble to a record low against the dollar and sparked economic chaos. The Moscow Exchange remains closed for a second day. Wall Street looks set to drop at the opening bell, with banking stocks suffering more losses as the Russia-Ukraine crisis deepens. Citigroup fell 1.6pc in premarket trading to lead losses among the big banks as the war and ensuing sanctions continue to rattle markets. Futures tracking the S&P 500 and Dow Jones fell 0.6pc, while the Nasdaq pointed 0.7pc lower. Jaguar Land Rover is halting deliveries to Russia due to ""trading challenges"" in the wake of the war in Ukraine. The British car maker, which is based in Coventry, said it was halting sales and would keep monitoring the situation. Last year it sold 6,900 vehicles in the country. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the decision, writing on Twitter: ""There is now a rapidly growing number of companies and governments joining the whole international community in isolating Russia, both diplomatically and financially."" I welcome Jaguar Land Rover's decision to pause the delivery of vehicles into the Russian market.There is now a rapidly growing number of companies and governments joining the whole international community in isolating Russia, both diplomatically and financially. — Kwasi Kwarteng (@KwasiKwarteng) March 1, 2022 The EU is said to be discussing a ban of seven Russian banks from the Swift financial messaging system, including VTB and Bank Rossiya. The other institutions targeted are Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Sovcombank and VEB.RF, according to a draft list seen by Bloomberg. The list is a subset of the banks already facing sanctions from the bloc and doesn’t include Sberbank – Russia’s biggest lender – or Gazprombank. The final list would need to be agreed upon with other jurisdictions including the US. Western nations agreed over the weekend to exclude some Russian banks from the Swift system, which underpins trillions of dollars worth of global transactions, amid wider sanctions against Moscow. Russia's top security official has hit back at France's finance minister Bruno le Maire after he promised to wage an economic and financial war against Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, wrote on Twitter: ""Today, some French minister has said that they declared an economic war on Russia. ""Watch your tongue, gentlemen! And don’t forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones."" Earlier today Le Maire told French radio that ""we are going to deliver a total economic and financial war against Russia"" over its invasion of Ukraine.

And don’t forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones — Dmitry Medvedev (@MedvedevRussiaE) March 1, 2022 The FTSE's losses just keep deepening. Early gains have been completely reversed, and the blue-chip index is now down 1.4pc. Polymetal International has once again posted a dramatic fall of 26.8pc. Fellow Russian miner Evraz has shed 14pc. The biggest drag, though, is coming from oil giants BP and Shell, which have both announced plans to withdraw from Russia. Gambling group Flutter is also down 14pc after the Ukraine crisis and unfavourable sports results dented its full-year figures. The Government has passed a new law banning all ships that have any connection to Russia from entering British ports. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said yesterday that he'd written to all ports asking them to refuse entry to ships that were Russian flagged, registered or controlled while ministers drew up new legislation. In a tweet this morning, Mr Shapps wrote: ""We've just become the first nation to pass a law involving a total ban of all ships with any Russian connection whatsoever from entering British ports.""

The US last week sanctioned Nord Stream 2 AG, which is registered in Switzerland and owned by Kremlin-controlled gas giant Gazprom, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, meaning other entities will be blocked from doing business with it. The company has completed the $11bn (£8.2bn) gas link, but Germany halted its approval due to the crisis. In a further blow, major backer Shell said it was pulling out of the project. Nord Stream 2 AG has been working with a financial adviser on clearing some of its liabilities and could formally begin insolvency proceedings as soon as this week, Reuters reports. The company is also terminating the contracts of workers. Switzerland's Economy Minister Guy Parmelin told local radio that all Nord Stream staff – more than 140 employees – who worked in Zug had been fired. Private equity firms Bain Capital and CVC are said to have abandoned their pursuit of Boots in a move that could open the door to a takeover by Asda. The consortium of suitors led by the two firms decided against submitting a formal offer last week despite months working on a potential deal, Sky News reports. The decision is said to have been driven largely by the price expectations of owner Walgreen Boots Alliance. It leaves just a handful of bidders – including Asda, Apollo Global Management and Sycamore Capital – with offers of more than £6bn reportedly tabled last week. Oil has jumped back above $100 a barrel as markets struggle with huge uncertainty over the war in Ukraine. Prices dipped in late trading yesterday as traders weighed up the impact of western sanctions as well as potential plans by the US and other major consumers to release 60m barrels from their stockpiles. But benchmark Brent crude jumped around 4pc to over $101 as caution returned. Louise Dickson, analyst at Rystad Energy, told Bloomberg: The fragile situation in Ukraine and financial and energy sanctions against Russia will keep the energy crisis stoked and oil well above $100 per barrel in the near-term and even higher if the conflict escalates further. The FTSE 100's rally has proved to be short-lived, with the blue-chip index quickly falling back into the red. Shares had started on the front foot this morning as markets took a breather after Monday's sell-off. But lingering worries over Ukraine, coupled with some disappointing corporate results, mean the FTSE is now trading down 0.9pc. Russian miner Polymetal International has tumbled 17pc, continuing its run of heavy losses since the invasion started last week. Paddy Power and Betfair owner Flutter dropped 14pc after the war and a string of unfavourable sporting results dented its profits. This also dragged down rival Entain by 5.8pc. Shell and BP, which have both announced plans to withdraw from Russia, weighed heavily on the index. Losses are being capped by commodity firms including Rio Tinto and Anglo American. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca pushed higher on a deal to develop an experimental heart drug. The fall is even more severe for the FTSE 250, which is down 1.2pc. Publisher Reach and miner Petropavlovsk posted the biggest declines. Dave Atkinson at Lloyds Bank said the latest PMI data shows signs of further growth, but supply chains could start to feel the impact of the Ukraine crisis. The sector continues to enjoy strong growth as it defies the drag of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. There are also promising signs for further growth. The incoming corporation tax rise could stimulate growth as some firms choose to reinvest taxable profits into the business. The aerospace subsector is also readying for a period of acceleration as the threat of Covid subsides and typical production cycles resume in line with growing passenger numbers. However, the ripple effect from the situation in Ukraine on international supply chains is naturally creating concern. We should expect to see some stockpiling by companies with supply chains in the region as they seek to mitigate against the fluctuating currencies and raw material costs. Growth in the UK manufacturing sector gathered pace in February thanks to strong demand, fewer material shortages and easing supply troubles. The IHS Markit PMI rose to a three-month high of 58 last month, up from 57.3 in January. Faster growth of output, new orders and stocks of purchases all helped lift the gauge in February, offsetting the impact of slower job creation and a lessening of supply chain disruptions. Although input price inflation remained elevated, the latest survey also signalled that cost increases were starting to moderate. The UK manufacturing #PMI rose sharply in February to a 3-month high of 58.0 (Jan: 57.3). Output growth was aided by stronger domestic demand and easing global supply chain pressures. Input price inflation remained elevated, however.

Borrowing using credit cards, personal loans and overdraft totalled around £600m during the month, according to Bank of England figures. That's down from £800m in December and below the average in the second half of last year. Mortgage approvals and lending rose more than forecast, suggesting the house market boom continued at the start of the year. Natural gas prices have climbed again this morning amid concerns Russia could cut supplies to Europe after it was hit with sanctions. Benchmark prices rose as much as 7.5pc in their second day of gains. The UK equivalent was up 6.3pc. While Russian gas continues to flow interrupted to Europe, officials are preparing for the Kremlin to halt shipments in retaliation to sanctions. Europe relies on Russia for about a third of its gas, with many shipments flowing through pipelines crossing Ukraine. Any disruptions could push prices even higher and deepen the ongoing energy crisis.

The French company said it will no longer provide capital for new projects in the country, but stopped short of divesting its assets. It said: ""TotalEnergies supports the scope and strength of the sanctions put in place by Europe and will implement them regardless of the consequences (currently being assessed) on its activities in Russia. ""TotalEnergies will no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia."" In comes after Total held talks with the French government over its presence in Russia, with finance minister Bruno le Maire insisting it was a ""question of principle"". BP has announced it's selling its 20pc stake in Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, while Shell is withdrawing from its joint ventures with Gazprom and cutting its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Wow, wow no, I was wrong!!!! French energy-giant Total ***is staying*** in Russia. It announces what's constitutes a complete spineless measure of announcing it won't pour money into **new projects**. But that's it. For now, Total stays. #Ukraine https://t.co/7C0BWWDcAy pic.twitter.com/Y4iJKDx9ct — Javier Blas (@JavierBlas) March 1, 2022 Newspaper group Reach has plunged more than 20pc to the bottom of the FTSE 250 after it warned cost inflation in print would dent its profits in the year ahead. The Mirror and Express publisher said higher newsprint prices had intensified since the end of the year, while energy and distribution costs had also risen. The company said it was taking steps to mitigate the impact, but that it expected a ""modest"" reduction in operating profit. Reach reported a 2.6pc rise in revenue to £615.8m in 2021, while pre-tax profit rose to £143.5m from £131.3m the previous year. Builders’ merchant Travis Perkins swung back to a profit and posted a strong rise in sales last year thanks to the boom in house building and renovations. The company posted sales of £4.6bn in 2021, up from £3.7bn a year earlier. Pre-tax profits reached £305.6m, compared to a £20.3m pre-tax loss in 2020. Travis Perkins hailed a strong year following the restructuring of the business, though rising inflation and supply troubles took their toll. Bosses warned inflation pressures would continue, but said the firm would benefit from refurbishments as more people worked from home, as well as continued strength in the house market. During the year the company sold off its Wickes business, and later its plumbing and heating division for £325m, as it slims down its portfolio. It still owns catalogue business Toolstation, which saw a 20pc jump in sales to £761m as it opened 70 new stores in the UK and 40 in Europe. Away from the Ukraine crisis, let's take a look at some of the corporate news from the FTSE this morning.... Gambling group Flutter has slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 in early trading as the situation in Ukraine and safer gambling plans offset the positive outlook. The owner of Paddy Power and Betfair said it had been “materially” reducing its online exposure in Russia, which accounted for £41m of revenue last year. Ukraine contributed £19m. Gambling safety measures and unfavourable sporting results also took their toll on fourth-quarter performance. Shares dropped 10pc. For the full year, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation excluding the US came in at £1.24bn – at the low end of expectations. Revenue of £6bn was in line with forecasts. The European Commission is seeking member states’ approval to block Kremlin-controlled media outlets RT and Sputnik across the bloc regardless of how they’re distributed. EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the measures would block operators from broadcasting, facilitating or otherwise contributing to the dissemination of any RT and Sputnik content. This includes transmission or distribution via cable, satellite, IPTV, internet video sharing platforms or applications, whether new or pre-installed. YouTube has already said it’s blocking access to channels controlled by RT and Sputnik across Europe, while Facebook has said it will restrict access. Twitter said it will label tweets from Russian state media and reduce their visibility. Shipping giant Maersk will suspend all container deliveries to and from Russia in response to western sanctions against the Kremlin. The Danish company said: “As the stability and safety of our operations is already being directly and indirectly impacted by sanctions, new Maersk bookings within ocean and inland to and from Russia will be temporarily suspended.” The move, which covers all Russian ports, will not include foodstuffs, medical and humanitarian supplies. Maersk operates container shipping routes to St Petersburg and Kaliningrad in the Baltic Sea, Novorossiysk in the Black Sea, and to Vladivostok and Vostochny on Russia’s east coast. The FTSE 100 has started the day in the green as markets regained their footing after yesterday’s turmoil. The blue-chip index rose as much as 0.5pc in early trading, before easing back to marginal gains. Commodity-linked shares are the biggest upward momentum on the index, with Rio Tinto, Glencore, Anglo American and BP all pushing higher. AstraZeneca also rose 2.5pc after it inked a $760m (£566m) deal with a Swiss biotech firm to develop an experimental heart drug. Gambling giant Flutter and chemicals firm Croda were the biggest fallers, down 8pc and 5.3pc respectively after their full-year results disappointed investors. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 fell 0.2pc, with Mirror owner Reach tumbling 13.9pc after its results. The rouble has recovered some of its heavy losses but remained under pressure on foreign markets, while Russian shares were suspended for a second day as sanctions tear through the economy. The Russian currency found some support after authorities ordered exporting companies – including energy giants such as Gazprom and Rosneft – to sell 80pc of their forex revenues on the market. The rouble gained 3.3pc to 91.49 against the dollar in Moscow. In electronic trading it stood at 103, though this was comfortably above the all-time low of 120 hit on Monday. Russia's central bank doubled interest rates to 20pc and took other emergency measures after the war sparked market chaos, but western sanctions have limited its ability to intervene. Meanwhile, authorities refused to reopen the Moscow Exchange for a second day amid fears of a huge market crash. The EU is gearing up for any disruptions of natural gas supplies amid concerns Moscow could halt shipments in retaliation for sanctions. EU energy ministers held an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss various supply-shock scenarios following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the rollout of sanctions. EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told reports: “Following the measures taken by the EU and the international community to sanction Russia, we can’t exclude that Russia will take retaliatory steps that will impact the energy trade.” Europe relies on Russia for about a third of its gas. But Mr Simson said the EU would be able to “get through this winter safely” even if supplies were cut. Britain has teamed up with European allies to help wean Germany off Russian gas – a move that would pave the way for sanctions against the Kremlin's powerful energy industry.

Ms Gorman, who is currently executive vice president for finance in Shell’s global upstream business, will replace Jessica Uhl. Ms Uhl joined Shell in 2004 and was appointed finance director in 2017. The company said the relocation of its headquarters to the UK was ""not sustainable"" for her, and she will step down at the end of the month. It comes after the oil giant said it was pulling out of Russia after decades and would stop working on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The FTSE 100 has crept higher at the open as markets take a breather after Monday's fierce sell-off. The blue-chip index rose 0.2pc to 7,470 points. BP is said to be considering selling its 20pc stake in Rosneft back to the Kremlin-controlled company at a huge discount after the invasion of Ukraine forced an exodus from Russian assets. The FTSE 100 oil giant considers a deal with Rosneft the most realistic transactions because it would struggle to sell down its stake on the market or find a buyer, Bloomberg reports. BP has already warned it could take a hit of up to $25bn (£18.7bn) from its decision to exit Russia. Read more on this story: BP abandons stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft Bitcoin has surged in value in recent days in a sign the war in Ukraine is bolstering demand for cryptocurrency. The largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 6pc to trade above $44,000, while other major digital coins also gained ground. It's now dipped back to $43,300. Bitcoin trading in the Russian rouble went into overdrive when the invasion began last Thursday with daily volumes rising 259pc from a day earlier to 1.3bn rouble (£9.2m), according to data from CryptoCompare. The bullish run suggests traders might be turning to notoriously volatile but anonymous cryptocurrencies as a safe-haven asset as conflict wreaks havoc through markets. The rouble plunged to a record low against the dollar yesterday, while Russia has banned citizens from transferring money abroad. Ukraine has also been asking for donations in cryptocurrency to help fund its defence. Asian stocks regained some composure overnight after a dramatic sell-off fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Markets have been in turmoil amid a wave of sanctions, which included cutting some banks off the Swift payments network and targeting Russia's central bank. Ceasefire talks between Moscow and Kyiv ended without any agreement on Monday, but Asian stocks stabilised on signs of no immediate escalation of sanctions. China's blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite both closed 0.8pc higher. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.4pc and Japan's Nikkei jumped 1.5pc. The Russian rouble regained some footing after crashing to an all-time low, while the safe-haven dollar resumed its rise against other major currencies. Good morning.  Mastercard has said it's blocked ""multiple"" financial institutions after western nations slapped tough sanctions on Russia. The credit card company didn't say which institutions have been restrictions, but said it was working with regulators on the matter. Visa has also said it's taking action to ensure compliance with sanctions. It comes as Russia grapples with the financial fallout from sanctions. The rouble crashed to a record low against the dollar yesterday and authorities are fearing a run on banks. Ukraine has called for Mastercard and Visa to block all transactions on debit and credit cards issued by Russian banks. 1) Ghosts of the 1990s haunt Putin as Russian economy descends into chaos The president came to power promising to restore order, but now he appears to be losing his grip on markets 2) Commuters hit by biggest rise in rail fares in almost a decade National rail fares are set to rise by 3.8pc, undermining the drive to get workers back to the office 3) Container lines move to halt sailings to Russia Singapore's Ocean Network Express, a major operator, suspended bookings and rivals may follow suit 4) Putin forces Germany to rethink nuclear power shutdown Germany prepared to keep nuclear plants open in a turning point for its energy policy 5) Rouble plunges and interest rates double as Russian economy reels from sanctions Moscow closes its stock exchange after one of the worst wipe-outs in market history Asia enjoyed another broadly positive day, with Tokyo, Sydney, Taipei, Jakarta and Wellington more than 1pc up while Shanghai, Singapore and Manila were also up.

3/3/2022,"Americans who rely on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction at tax time may be in luck. A Democratic proposal aims to restore the SALT deduction for taxpayers who make less than $400,000 a year and increase the deduction cap for Americans who make up to $1 million. The Supporting Americans with Lower Taxes (SALT) Act, sponsored by U.S. Reps. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Katie Porter (D-Calif.) would undo the $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction instituted in 2018 under former President Donald Trump. Here's a look at how the SALT deduction and how the proposed legislation could impact your finances. For help with your taxes, managing your investments or creating a holistic financial plan, consider working with a financial advisor. What is the SALT Deduction? The state and local tax deduction has existed since the federal income tax was introduced in 1913. The provision allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property, sales and/or income taxes they paid to state or local governments on their federal income tax returns. Previously, there was no cap on SALT deductions. This allowed taxpayers to deduct as many state and local taxes from their federal income. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) created a $10,000 limit on the deduction, disproportionately affecting higher-income earners in high-tax states. Critics argue that the SALT deduction is merely a tax loophole for the wealthy. Prior to the TCJA, taxpayers making at least $100,000 a year realized 91% of the benefit of the SALT deduction, according to the Tax Foundation. How SALT Would Change
 While the $10,000 ceiling on the SALT deduction is set to expire at the end of 2025 under the TCJA, Malinowski and Porter hope to reform the tax code before that happens. Under the SALT Act, people making less than $400,000 would once again be permitted to deduct all state and local taxes on their federal income tax returns, provided they itemize their deductions. But instead of lifting the cap for all taxpayers, under the proposed legislation, the deduction would start at $60,000 for those making over $400,000 and reduce at a rate of $10,000 for each $100,000 of income thereafter. Pointing to Tax Foundation estimates, Malinowski and Porter say their bill will raise $150.9 billion over 10 years compared to maintaining the $10,000 ceiling through 2025 and then allowing it to expire completely. Under the proposed legislation, the revenue would be used to create a Medicare Vision and Hearing Trust Fund and pay for hearing and vision benefits. ""Our tax code should provide a level playing field across states, not punish some Americans for living in regions with high costs of living,"" Porter said in a statement. ""Our SALT Act will restore fairness to our tax code, with sensible guardrails to prevent abuse by the ultra-wealthy."" Benjamin Silliman, a professor of accountancy at St. John's University in New York, said the legislation would reset the tax base more equitably and have a positive impact. However, he offered one caveat. ""In many states, the cap on the SALT deduction causes taxpayers to have to fork over even more money to the federal government. In the end, increasing the SALT deduction cap will be a step in the right direction,"" Silliman said. ""The one reality that this proposal lacks is that a large portion of the SALT deduction goes to property owners, where lower- and middle-income taxpayers who do not own homes may not benefit as much from the SALT deduction. This will have to be addressed by Congress sooner rather than later."" Will It Become Law? Since the SALT deduction is designed to help Americans avoid double-taxation, those living in higher-cost-of-living (and often Democratic) states tend to benefit the most. But can Democrats pass the reform? While they currently hold a majority in the House of Representatives and own a tie-breaker in the Senate, the midterm elections in November could dramatically reshape the two chambers in favor of Republicans, limiting Democrats' hopes of repealing the cap on SALT deductions. And this also isn't the first time Democrats have sought to reform the laws surrounding SALT. The $1.75 trillion Build Back Better act included a provision that would have raised the cap on SALT deductions from $10,000 to $80,000. While House Democrats passed the bill in November, it stalled in the Senate, dashing hopes of SALT reform. Bottom Line A pair of House Democrats have sponsored legislation that would restore the state and local tax (SALT) deduction for Americans who make under $400,000. Trump's 2017 tax cut capped the previously unlimited SALT deduction at $10,000, hurting taxpayers who itemize their deductions, especially those in high-tax states. However, the new bill aims to remove that ceiling for the majority of taxpayers who itemize and institute a new, increased cap for those who earn over $400,000 per year.

3/3/2022,"Russian natural gas giant Gazprom, oil producer Lukoil and leading bank Sberbank are all penny stocks based on their trading on the London Stock Exchange, as the local market was shut for a third day.",World/MarketWatch•8 hours ago,"Gazprom, Lukoil and Sberbank are now penny stocks as Russian companies collapse in London",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a4b7c2c5-d809-3a8b-befc-ecb07522c891/gazprom-lukoil-and-sberbank.html
3/3/2022,"All in all, the stock market is hanging tough in what has been a turbulent two weeks for humanity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 600 points on Wednesday as of this writing. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are nearing gains of 2%. All three major indexes are nicely off the lows hit by the close of trading on Feb. 23, a mere hours before Russia invaded Ukraine. Every member of the FAANG [Facebook/Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google/Alphabet] cohort has gained in the last five trading days as luck would have it, paced by a nearly 7% increase in Alphabet. And believe us, there are many things trying very hard to bring the major stock indexes to their collective knees. Oil prices ripped through $110 a barrel on Wednesday as the war between Russia and Ukraine intensified. Western company after Western company are saying see you later to Russia in light of its action. One of the latest names is credit card giant American Express. These actions by the West has some Wall Street strategists telling Yahoo Finance Live the Russian economy is poised to nosedive into a deep, protracted recession. Meanwhile top emerging market investors such as Mark Mobius tell us Russia may be uninvestable for more than a year, and putting money to work in other emerging markets like China and Brazil are not without heightened risk. And as oil prices spike — and it can be considered a spike (leading to a potential super-spike as Goldman Sachs chief commodities strategist Jeff Currie explained to us) — gas prices in America keep on rising, rising and rising further. The average price of petrol in California is approaching $5 a gallon, the highest in the country. The extra money gas inflation will siphon out of the pockets of consumers is real. That's money that could be spent at Macy's for a new pair of jeans. That's extra money it will cost a FedEx to ship a package due to higher fuel expenditures. And what is FedEx likely to do about it? Jack up prices further on the beat-up wallets of consumers. Despite the litany of issues — which naturally could hammer corporate profits in 2022 — there is the good ole' stock market hanging tough. Why is that the case you ask? I am glad you did ask. Market pros say that investors are looking beyond all the headline chaos and remain fixated on the king daddy of factors that tend to upset stock price valuations. Higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Weird stuff, right? ""One of the reasons why the stock market has held up so well is belief that the Fed will not be as aggressive in their new tightening policy as some were thinking they would be before the crisis in eastern Europe erupted. So if we get some positive reinforcement on this subject, the stock market could hold up (or even bounce) for a while,"" said Miller Tabak chief markets strategist Matt Maley. Maley is on the mark here, judging by the positive reaction in stock prices to fresh commentary from Fed chief Jerome Powell in his testimony to lawmakers today. “The bottom line is we will proceed but we will proceed carefully as we learn more about the implications of the Ukraine war,” Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. Yahoo Finance Fed correspondent Brian Cheung points out Powell said he supports increasing short-term interest rates by 0.25% in the next policy-setting meeting on March 15 and 16. Coming into March, most market experts were bracing for a 50-basis rate hike at the March meeting followed by eight to 10 more increases in rates into year-end. But Powell has officially reset the narrative, and investors love it. So there you have it, folks. Inflation is running rampant. Profit margins are under attack. Vladimir Putin is playing terror to the world. And yet, there are markets fixated on rate hike comments from one of the most powerful people in the financial industry in Powell. No one said investing made sense. It doesn't make sense now, and it will unlikely make sense tomorrow. Rest assured, however, that at some point soon markets will move beyond rate hike fears and refocus on geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. When that happens, those aforementioned Feb. 23 lows for stocks could be in play. You have been warned. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
