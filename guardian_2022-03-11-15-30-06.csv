3/11/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray with Friday’s top stories. Joe Biden is expected to ratchet up the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin today by moving to end normal trade relations with Russia. Lawmakers in both houses of Congress have reportedly expressed support for removing Russia’s status of “permanent normal trade relations”, also known as “most favoured nation” status, because of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden will seek to do it in co-ordination with US allies and the G7 countries, sources have said. It comes on top of widespread sanctions and the banning of oil imports from Russia by the US and UK. A stream of leading international companies such as Apple, Shell, Ikea and McDonald’s have pulled out of Russia; the Kremlin is threatening to retaliate by seizing their corporate assets in Russia. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of being a “terrorist state”, saying it prevented a delivery of food, water and medicine to the besieged city of Mariupol by attacking a humanitarian corridor with tanks. Zelenskiy has condemned Moscow’s relentless assault on cities – branding the attack on the corridor “outright terror ... from experienced terrorists”. More than 400,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol, which is surrounded by Russian forces, and basic supplies are running out. Zelenskiy denied Russia’s accusation that Ukraine is preparing to use chemical or biological weapons. He echoed western leaders’ prediction that Russia is preparing to attack with such weapons and then blame it on Kyiv. Zelenskiy said: “We’ve been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia’s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of.” The UN security council is expected today to discuss the unsubstantiated Russian claims. Satellite images released by the US company Maxar appear to show the large Russian military convoy north-west of Kyiv has dispersed and fanned out through towns and forests, with artillery pieces moved into firing positions. The Ukrainian military said in its daily operational report on Friday morning that Russian troops were trying to regroup and replenish supplies.

Calculation triples Covid deaths – The Covid-19 pandemic may have claimed 18.2 million lives around the world, more than three times official figures, a study suggests. A consortium of health researchers writing in the Lancet base their calculation on “excess deaths”: the difference between deaths recorded from all causes, and the number expected in that period based on previous patterns. For the UK, their estimate of Covid deaths (163,000 to 174,000) is close to the reported figure of 173,000. If the researchers’ findings are correct, the global rate of excess deaths due to the pandemic was 120.2 people per 100,000 of the population. In the UK, Boris Johnson has promised bereaved families will have their voices heard as he published wide-ranging terms of reference for the public inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Frack busters on alert – Anti-fracking campaigners have vowed to give energy firms “no peace” if the government lifts the moratorium on fracking. A month ago fracking was declared effectively dead in Britain after Cuadrilla announced plans to concrete up its Blackpool wells. But after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and expected shortages of gas, some Conservative MPs and energy lobbyists are touting it as the solution. Tina Rothery says her Nana Samba Band – veterans of Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road fracking site – will be making a racket outside the Conservatives’ spring conference in Blackpool on 18 and 19 March. In Ryedale, Yorkshire, the Kirby Misperton site is no longer at risk of fracking after it was taken over by the renewable energy firm Wolfland Group. Steve Mason, an anti-fracking activist and one of Wolfland’s directors, said other energy companies still held licences to frack in Yorkshire and elsewhere, and protesters would be ready should the government lift its moratorium. Mental illness strains schools – Schools and teachers in England are said to be “buckling under the strain” of supporting pupils with mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Education and health experts have said it is partly because only one in four of the 500,000 children and young adults are successfully referred every year to NHS mental health services – leaving them to fall back on teachers, only 40% of whom feel equipped to help. Rates of mental illness in under-18s are said to have risen by half in the past three years. The government said its response included offering training to senior mental health leads in every state school and college by 2025, and an additional £79m to expand children’s mental health services and accelerate the rollout of mental health support teams. Fake attack actor jailed – The US actor Jussie Smollett has been sentenced to 30 months of probation, including 150 days of jail time, after his conviction for lying to police about a racist and homophobic attack that he orchestrated himself. Smollett had told police two men wearing ski masks beat him and hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him on a dark Chicago street and ran off. The 39-year-old was also ordered to pay $120,000 in restitution to the city of Chicago and fined $25,000. What’s driving Vladimir Putin and his assault on Ukraine? The president’s attitude to power – in Russia and beyond – has changed steadily since 1999, says Sam Greene, the co-author of Putin v the People: The Perilous Politics of a Divided Russia.

The World Bank’s chief economist, Carmen Reinhart, has warned that Russia and its ally Belarus are “mightily close” to default. A key test will come on Wednesday next week, when the Russian state has to make a $117m (£89m) payment on some of its debts denominated in US dollars. While Russia has relatively low debts and its financial system is less integrated with the rest of the world than other countries’, some analysts warn an imminent Russian debt default could have unforeseen consequences. At the end of one of the strangest days in the history of English football, Thomas Tuchel suggested it was “business as usual” for Chelsea as the European champions eased to a 3-1 win against Norwich just a few short hours after the club had been placed in suspended animation by government sanctions. The Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema says “action and not thoughts are needed” to help the victims of the war in Ukraine as she fronts an emergency response by Common Goal. Nkrumah Bonner made an obdurate 125 from 355 balls to help West Indies to a 62-run lead over England after the third day of the first Test in Antigua. England’s head coach Eddie Jones says his team have “one intention – that’s to go after Ireland” in Saturday’s Six Nations showdown, although he did not seem 100% confident about the fitness of Kyle Sinckler. An opening round of 66 for Tommy Fleetwood at the Players Championship supplied evidence of a return to form for a golfer who hasn’t tasted victory since 2019. Mercedes have firmly rejected suggestions their new car for the Formula One season features any illegal components. The former England and Arsenal forward Kelly Smith expressed her delight at the number of girls taking part in the biggest football session in schools across the country on Wednesday, with numbers topping 90,000. And cricket is “facing a reckoning” as a result of the Azeem Rafiq affair and needs to take a long look in the mirror when it comes to discrimination, the chair of the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket has said. The highest US inflation for 40 years has cast gloom over financial markets today and heightened speculation about how far the Federal Reserve will go in raising interest rates at next week’s meeting. Prices jumped 7.9% in the US in February and moves this week by Washington and London to ban Russian oil imports could bring further upward pressure on the cost of living. Asian stocks have seen hefty losses already although the FTSE100 looks set to open flat. The pound has fallen to $1.308 and €1.188. Brent crude fell again earlier but has levelled off at around $109. The desperate situation in Mariupol leads today’s Guardian front page: “‘Medieval’ conditions in a city under constant attack”. Also on page one: “UK freezes assets of Chelsea FC owner over Putin links”. Ministers say Roman Abramovich, one of the world’s richest men, has “clear connections” to Vladimir Putin’s regime and is one of those with “blood on their hands”. That blood-on-hands line recurs on the front pages of the i, the Metro and the Times. The Mirror paints Abramovich and Putin as “Blood brothers”, superimposing their photos on to a hellish street scene in Irpin, near Kyiv. The Mail says “Abramovich’s dirty billions frozen at last” while its splash is “Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the war” – it says 4 million people have fled. “Putin takes revenge on the west” – the Express reports that the Russian ruler is “threatening to send global food prices soaring and imposing his own export bans”. It has a picture of a “tank ambush” by the Ukrainians against the Russians, written about here by our defence editor, Dan Sabbagh, with accompanying drone video. “British public to be asked to take in refugees” says the Telegraph, which reports on year-long stays without a visa being granted to Ukrainians with no family links in the UK. Its downpage story is very interesting: “Russian state television broadcasts criticism of war”. Pundits referred to it as another Soviet invasion of Afghanistan “but even worse” as pro-Kremlin hosts struggled to silence them, the paper says.

3/11/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of being a “terrorist state” after its tanks prevented a delivery of food, water and medicine to the besieged city of Mariupol, and said Moscow was capable of chemical weapon attacks. As Russian forces appeared to be regrouping in order to encircle Kyiv and the US planned to ratchet up the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin, Zelenskiy tried to rally Ukrainians with another video address late on Thursday condemning Moscow’s relentless assault on cities. “This is outright terror ... from experienced terrorists,” he said of the alleged attack on the aid convoy. “The world needs to know this. I have to admit it – we are all dealing with a terrorist state. “They did it deliberately, they knew what they were blowing up, they have an order to keep the city a hostage, abuse it and bomb it constantly, and shell it.” More than 400,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol, which is surrounded by Russian forces, and basic supplies are running out. Some 200,000 are believed to want to leave amid a relentless Russian artillery onslaught but have not been able to do so despite the daily declaration of humanitarian corridors. Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russia was targeting residential areas “every 30 minutes”. At least 1,207 people have died although the real figure is believed to be much higher because residents cannot leave their homes to retrieve dead bodies from the streets. Zelenskiy said no one had been able to escape the city on Thursday, although 100,000 had managed to leave other under-fire cities such as Irpin near Kyiv, Sumy and Hostomel in the past two days. Russia has called a meeting of the UN security council on Friday to discuss what it claims are US plans to use biological weapons in Ukraine. But Zelenskiy denied any such tactic and said the claim showed it was Russia that planned to use chemical weapons. “This makes me really worried,” Zelenskiy said, “because we’ve been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia’s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of.” In a potentially significant military development, satellite images released by the US company Maxar Technologies on Thursday appeared to show that the large Russian military convoy last seen north-west of Kyiv had largely dispersed and redeployed. Maxar said its pictures showed that armoured units had fanned out through towns and forests in the area, with artillery pieces moved into potential firing positions. A US defence official cited by CNN said that Russian forces had moved 5km (about 3 miles) closer to Kyiv, despite Ukrainians fighting back “very, very well” around the capital city. UK defence intelligence agreed that Russia was “likely” trying to reset for an assault on Kyiv. The Ukrainian military said in its daily operational report on Friday morning that Russian troops had dispersed to regroup and replenish supplies. Attacks appeared to be intensifying in western Ukraine with air-raid sirens heard in Lviv, explosions reported in Lutsk, and bombing in Ivano-Frankivsk. Dnipro, a major stronghold in central-eastern Ukraine, suffered air strikes on Friday morning, leaving at least one person dead, state emergency services said. The strike in Lutsk targeted an airfield according to city’s mayor, Igor Polishchuk, who urged his citizens to take cover in a Facebook post early on Friday. US president Joe Biden will announce another ratcheting up of the economic pressure on Friday when he calls for the end of normal trade relations with Russia. This measure, which is likely to be rubber-stamped and passed into law by Congress, will make Russia a pariah in the world economy in the same category as Cuba and North Korea. It could lead to increased tariffs on Russian goods and will remove what in international trade is termed “most favoured nation status” . It follows the decision by Biden and British prime minister Boris Johnson this week to ban oil imports from Russia into their countries as they attempt to increase already crippling pressure on Russia brought on by its exclusion from global financial markets. The price of oil slipped back again on Friday and is set to record its biggest weekly drops since November after see-sawing on fears that more countries would ban Russian imports, balanced by the growing prospect that other big producers could bring on more supply. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 0.67% to $108.60 at 2am GMT after dropping 1.6% in the previous session. US West Texas intermediate crude fell 0.13% to $105.88 a barrel, following a 2.5% decline on Thursday. Outlawing all US trade with Russia would deepen the already serious economic problems facing Putin’s regime. Earlier on Thursday, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said Russia was “moving into a deep recession”, with massive depreciation of the rouble and sinking purchasing power for its citizens. A debt default was no longer “an improbable event”, she said. A stream of leading international companies such as Apple, Shell, Ikea and McDonald’s have pulled out of Russia, but the Kremlin is threatening to retaliate by seizing corporate assets. European Union leaders meeting at Versailles to discuss the Ukraine crisis said in a statement on Thursday night that Russia was “inflicting unspeakable suffering on the Ukrainian population” and called for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of forces. They “acknowledged the European aspirations” of Ukraine and agreed to support Ukraine in “pursuing its European path”. They also praised Ukraine’s courageous resistance and promised “we will not leave them alone”. Many east European member countries such as Estonia and Lithuania have called for Ukraine to be fast-tracked into the 27-member club. But the careful language of the statement stopped a long way short of any hard commitments and reflected unease in western countries such as France, Spain and the Netherlands about any rapid admission. “What’s important is that Ukraine has asked to be member of the EU,” said Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte. “There is no fast-track procedure to become a member of the EU.” Zelenskiy attempted to keep the pressure up on the EU, however, saying in his address that he believed the Ukrainian people “have done everything to be welcomed” into the European club. “This is the final exam for Europe,” he said, adding that ordinary people in Europe had shown their support for Ukraine by protesting in the streets, and that “they would definitely choose Ukraine”.

3/11/2022,"Pamela Moses, the Memphis woman who was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote, says she is grateful to be released – but believes the case against her was a “scare tactic” to discourage other people from casting a ballot. Moses was released from prison on bond on 25 February after a judge unexpectedly granted her request for a new trial, citing evidence, obtained by the Guardian, that had not been disclosed to Moses’ defense. In her first interview since being freed Moses recalled the moment in the courtroom when Judge W Mark Ward decided to grant her a new trial – and said she was “overwhelmed with joy”. Video shows Moses nearly in tears and screaming in excitement when Ward ruled he was granting her a new trial. She knew that judges rarely reverse themselves and grant requests for new trials, but she had been praying Ward would see beyond her criminal record. “I was very grateful that God had allowed him to correct his own mistake, and that’s what you need in the criminal justice system.” But Moses, a longtime activist who founded the Memphis chapter of Black Lives Matter, still faces the possibility of a retrial. Moses says she was unaware she was ineligible to vote, and state officials acknowledged they made an error in indicating to her that she was eligible. Her case has brought renewed focus to the practice, common in many US states, of depriving people convicted of certain felonies of their voting rights for widely varying lengths of time, but sometimes for life. “It’s a scare tactic, what they did to me,” Moses told the Guardian. She thinks other people with criminal convictions will think twice before seeking to cast a ballot in elections. “It’s like, ‘if she went to jail for that, we don’t need to do that. We don’t need to follow her because we’re going to be in jail for six years too.’ I would say it sends a confusing message to people who want to vote. “Why should people be worried if they’re going to be prosecuted for doing their civic duty?” Moses is a well-known activist in Memphis who has filed numerous cases in local and federal courts, often representing herself. She has been outspoken against a number of local officials, including the local election commission, judges and Amy Weirich, the local district attorney who is prosecuting her case. She said she believes she’s being “persecuted” for being so outspoken. “If you silence the loudest person that’s screaming, ‘hey Black people, go vote, don’t vote for her, remove her from office’ then you eliminate the opposition,” she said. “I believe, not only if I wasn’t Black, but if my name wasn’t Pamela Moses, this probably never would have been a case.” Moses’ case attracted national attention because of the harshness of her sentence, which seemed at odds with the evidence in the case. Before the trial, election officials in Memphis conceded that they erroneously never removed her from the voter rolls after she pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2015. In 2019, Moses launched a campaign for mayor of Memphis and sought clarification from court officials about whether she had completed her felony probation and could appear on the ballot. A judge told her she was still on probation, but Moses still believed she was eligible and went to a probation office and asked them to verify her eligibility and sign a certificate saying she could vote. After about an hour of investigating, the probation officer did so. Prosecutors blamed Moses for this. In their request for an indictment, they wrote she “convinced” the officer to sign off on the document. And during her sentencing hearing, Ward, the judge overseeing her case, accused her of deceiving the probation officer into signing off on the eligibility certificate. Moses said she didn’t trick anyone and was stunned to hear such an assertion. “I was like wow, I need to go to magic school or something. I’m the new Houdini. I’ve got that much power to trick somebody I’ve never met, never seen in my life into doing something just by walking in the place? You know, no.” But a document obtained by the Guardian last month, after the trial concluded, showed that probation officials investigated the incident and found that the probation officer, identified as Manager Billington, had made an error on his own. Even though Moses’ file said she was still on probation, Billington thought that another person had made a mistake. The official who conducted the investigation ultimately determined that Billington was negligent and to blame for the error. Moses went out of her way to defend Billington. “I don’t like how everybody is portraying that supervisor as a bad person. That man did his job,” she said. “I don’t think that man did anything other than what he could do based on the information that he had in front of him.” But Moses was critical of Weirich, the prosecutor, who has said Moses bears some of the responsibility for her sentence because she declined to accept a plea deal that would not have resulted in additional prison time. “I gave her a chance to plead to a misdemeanor with no prison time,” Weirich said in February “She requested a jury trial instead. She set this unfortunate result in motion and a jury of her peers heard the evidence and convicted her.” Moses pushed back on that characterization. “I haven’t done anything in my mind wrong so why would I plead to anything?” she said. “We have a right to that. But you want me to give it up because you want it to be right? It was about the principle to me. “I hadn’t done anything wrong.” Weirich’s office did not immediately return a request for comment. Weirich has yet to say whether she will pursue a new trial. Moses and her new legal team plan to hold a press conference in Memphis on Friday asking her to drop all of the charges. Her prosecution may already be having a local policy impact. Citing her case, a coalition of civil rights groups is pushing the county commission to conduct a “racial equity audit” to examine whether there is racial discrimination in Weirich’s office. The Moses case is one of several high-profile instances that underscores the disparity between how white and Black defendants can be treated when it comes to election crimes. Several white defendants across the country received minimal punishments, such as probation, for purposefully impersonating family members in order to cast multiple votes – yet Black people who made mere mistakes when attempting to follow complicated processes and procedures received prison sentences. “The reason why Ms Moses’ situation has got the attention of the nation is because this sort of disparate treatment happens all the time,” said Rodney Diggs, one of her attorneys. “The disparate treatment between people of color and non-people of color. You can just see the differences.” Moses had been in jail since December, when the judge overseeing her case abruptly revoked her bond. She said that she contracted Covid-19. She was unaware of the attention her case was getting, except for periodic dispatches from a jail nurse who would mention that she had seen her on the local news. Her incarceration had been particularly hard on Tyler, her 24-year-old son, who she said lost his job and took on tasks like handling her mail and bills. Since she’s been released, she said she has spent time with her 13-year-old son Taj – a “mini me”. The weekend after she was released, they went to a funeral for a relative who had been killed. She has been taking him to school and they watch Netflix together. She hasn’t had to explain her case to him because he’d researched it on the internet. “He asked me certain things. And I just divert,” she said. Still, Moses said she still has a lot of anxiety. On Wednesday, she was at 40% back to normal. On Thursday, she said she was up to 65%. “I’m anxious. I’m worried because these charges haven’t gone away,” she said. “I mean look at how much money they spent on this. Just think about it. They probably could have built a school with all the money they spent prosecuting me over a piece of paper.”",News/US news,"‘It’s a scare tactic’: Pamela Moses, the Black woman jailed over voting error, speaks out",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/11/pamela-moses-black-woman-jailed-over-voting-error-speaks-out
3/11/2022,"Russia is close to being unable to pay its debts amid sanctions imposed by the west after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The World Bank’s chief economist, Carmen Reinhart, warned on Thursday that Russia and its ally Belarus were “mightily close” to default. A key test will come on Wednesday next week, when the Russian state has to make a $117m (£89m) payment on some of its debts denominated in US dollars. While Russia has relatively low debts and its financial system is less integrated with the rest of the world than other countries’, some analysts warn an imminent Russian debt default could have unforeseen consequences. A default occurs when a borrower fails to make agreed payments on their debts. The Bank of Canada and Bank of England, which track global sovereign defaults, estimate the total value of government debt in default around the world was $443.2bn in 2020 – about 0.5% of world public debt. Recent governments to default include Argentina, Belize, Ecuador and Suriname, with nations typically failing to keep up on payments denominated in foreign currencies. Some have strong track records, including the US and the UK. However, both have defaulted in the past – including Britain in 1672 under the reign of Charles II and the US in 1862 during the American civil war. Russia must make two coupon, or regular interest, payments on 16 March. However, it will have a 30-day grace period, meaning a default would not formally happen until at least April. Russia has defaulted before, including during the 1917 revolution and in 1998, when the country’s economy remained weak after the collapse of the Soviet union and the costs of war in Chechnya meant it was unable to keep up with its debt payments. However, even then, Russia kept up with dollar payments. The so-called rouble crisis caused severe damage for neighbouring economies and sent shock waves through the global financial system, including huge losses for the US hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. Russia has strengthened its financial position in recent years in response to western sanctions imposed after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, with the government running budget surpluses and cutting its reliance on the US dollar. According to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), Russia’s external liabilities – money owed to creditors by the government, companies and households – have fallen from about $733bn in 2014 to about $480bn. Of this, $135bn is due to be paid to creditors within one year. However, the amount owed by the government itself is relatively small. The state has about $40bn in foreign currency bonds denominated in dollars and euros – tiny compared with the size of its economy and with several comparable nations. Overseas investors also hold $28bn of Russian debt denominated in roubles. However, the scale of the problem is bigger for Russian corporates, with just under $100bn in international bonds outstanding. Investors in Russian debt include hedge funds, which prefer taking risky bets, and major global asset managers. According to the Financial Times, the US fund manager Pimco, one of the world’s biggest bond market investors, has amassed a $1.5bn position in Russian sovereign debt. Western sanctions on Russia’s central bank and the country’s biggest lenders are causing disruption for financial transactions. Moscow has also imposed capital controls in response, including suspending the transfer of coupon payments on sovereign debt to foreign investors. Russia’s finance ministry has said it will service and pay sovereign debts in full and on time. However, Putin has said Russian entities can pay their foreign currency debts in roubles priced at exchange rates set by the Russian central bank to residents of “countries that engage in hostile activities”. While Russia would have had enough foreign currency to cover debt payments, having amassed $630bn in reserves, the US, UK and EU freezing the assets of its central bank have made much of this sum inaccessible. The rating agency Fitch downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to its second-lowest level earlier this week, saying a default was “imminent”. Debt defaults make it harder and more expensive to borrow in future, given the reputational damage. However, Russia is already isolated on the global stage after the invasion of Ukraine. Western governments have also blocked the Russian state from raising new money on capital markets, including in London and New York. According to the IIF, sanctions pushing up the cost of funding is likely to hit the government’s financial position, potentially forcing Moscow to cut spending or raise taxes. Targeting Russia’s financial system is intended to inflict economic pain inside the country, although there could be indirect effects on the wider global banking system. However, many economists, including Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, have suggested Russia’s financial linkages to the rest of the world are small and not of systemic importance. Foreign banks have about $121bn in exposure to Russia, mainly in Europe, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements. The IIF estimates foreign banks play a minor role in the country, holding only 6.3% of total assets. The country’s corporate sector mainly relies on loans for funding from state-owned banks. Foreign participation in the Russian sovereign debt market currently stands at 20% of total outstanding debt, with political uncertainty since 2014 discouraging overseas buyers. The World Bank’s Reinhart told Reuters that repercussions had been limited thus far, but risks could still emerge. “I worry about what I do not see,” she said. “Financial institutions are well-capitalised, but balance sheets are often opaque … There is the issue of Russian private sector defaults. One cannot be complacent.”",News/World news,What happens if Russia can’t pay its debts after western sanctions?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/what-happens-if-russia-cant-pay-its-debts-after-western-sanctions
3/11/2022,"Schools and teachers are “buckling under the strain” of supporting the fast-growing number of schoolchildren developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, experts say. Despite being the people pupils turn to most often when in distress, teachers are hampered in their desire to help by the profession’s widespread lack of training in tackling mental ill-health. The huge barriers many families in England face getting help for their son or daughter from NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) put pressure on schools, according to a group of education and health experts writing in the journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. “Children’s burgeoning health needs are not currently being met by the health sector. Schools and teachers provide vital support but they are buckling under the strain of the demands placed on them,” they say. “The mental health of children and young people in England, and the services designed to support them, are in a dire state,” they add. While rates of mental illness in under-18s have risen by half in the last three years, “provision is nowhere near sufficient to meet need.” Only one in four of the 500,000 children and young people referred to CAMHS every year receive help as services are stretched, and many are refused care because they are deemed not ill enough. The authors include Chloe Lowry of the UCL Institute of Education in London, Lisa-Maria Müller and Alison Peacock from the Chartered College of Teaching and Anant Jani of Heidelberg university’s Institute of Global Health in Germany. Schools should receive funding from the NHS to help them train teachers to cope with rising need, they argue. Teachers’ detailed knowledge of and regular interaction with their pupils means they are “not only the first port of call when concerns arise, but for many the only port of call”. Children and young people seek help from them more often than from their own family, surveys show. Teachers are regarded, alongside GPs and social workers, as part of the first tier of support in CAMHS. “It is therefore both astonishing and alarming that teachers in England are not adequately trained for these roles,” the authors write. Only one teacher a school in England receives mental health awareness training. Despite being tier 1 CAMHS professionals, just 40% of classroom teachers feel equipped to teach children in their class with mental health needs and only 32% knew which organisations outside the school could help pupils, according to a report for the government in 2016. “While schools and colleges do all they can for pupils, it remains the case that the lack of support and provision of mental health services for children and young people has been an ongoing problem for many years,” said Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU, the main teaching union. Covid has made the situation worse, she added. “Workload, lack of external support, inadequate numbers of staff to work on pastoral issues and training are all huge barriers to pupils getting the support they need and should expect.” Dr Nihara Krause, a consultant clinical psychologist, said teachers need to have specialist mental health services they can refer pupils on to because pupils are displaying ever more complex problems. “Schools should offer basic mental health training to all staff, have specialist trained teachers, have support for staff to share the challenges they may be facing in their students and themselves, [and] have clear school policies and procedures on steps to take with students presenting with different mental health conditions,” added Krause. A government spokesperson said: “We are supporting teachers to help children and young people to recover from the emotional impact of the pandemic, including by offering training to senior mental health leads in every state school and college by 2025. “To support pupils with more complex needs, we have also invested an additional £79m to expand children’s mental health services and accelerate the rollout of mental health support teams, which will give nearly three million children in England access to health experts through school or college by April 2024.”",News/Education,Teachers ‘buckling under strain’ of pupils’ mental health crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/11/teachers-buckling-under-strain-of-pupils-mental-health-crisis
3/11/2022,"Anti-fracking campaigners have vowed to give energy firms “no peace” if the government lifts the moratorium on fracking, pledging “inconvenient and noisy” protests at every site. Steve Mason, campaign director of Frack Free United, said there was an army of retired “geri-activists” ready to lie down and face prosecution for the cause again. Tina Rothery, who was arrested seven times at Cuadrilla’s fracking site at Preston New Road near Blackpool, said campaigners were ready to unfurl their banners, dig out their drums and make life as hard as possible for any energy firm hoping to use the Ukraine crisis to restart fracking operations. It is only a month since fracking was declared effectively dead in Britain after Cuadrilla announced plans to concrete up its Blackpool wells. But after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the extreme form of energy extraction is back in the political spotlight, with a small cadre of Conservative MPs and energy lobbyists touting it as the solution to the nation’s energy security. Rothery was one of the so-called Nanas, a tireless band of women who kept watch at the gate of the Preston New Road site every day for years. Dressed in yellow tabards with matching headscarves and often with grandchildren in tow, the women revelled in a form of peaceful protest designed for maximum annoyance. The formation of the Nana Samba Band was viewed as the nadir for the Lancashire constabulary officers tasked with guarding the site gate until the government imposed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019. “A samba band is great if you like being inconvenient and noisy, and I can’t tell you the joy of having a drum on when a cop is coming towards you,” said Rothery. “A, you have two big sticks and B, the drum is in the way. Plus it’s a great way to beat the shit out of your rage.” Another Nana protest saw the site festooned with bras – a lacy nod to studies that suggested a link between proximity to fracking wells and an increase in cases of breast cancer. The Nana Samba Band will be making a racket outside the Conservative’s spring conference in Blackpool on 18 and 19 March, alongside anti-fracking protesters. “We will give the fracking industry no peace. We don’t even need to gear back up. We’ve got boots by the door, we’re ready,” said Rothery. “We’ve done it before, we’ll do it again.” Rothery’s view, shared by many privately in the energy industry, is that protesters made fracking so difficult, expensive and politically unpalatable the industry never really got off the ground in the UK. “We cost them so much money and time and public opinion that they could not recover from that,” she said. The Nanas formed after Cuadrilla began test drilling at Preston New Road in 2010, causing tiny earthquakes which spooked the local population in 2011. In Doncaster, the local Labour councillor Dave Shaw said he didn’t think fracking would seriously restart here “because any meaningful level of extraction is going to take 10 years at least”. But he said Frack Free South Yorkshire was nonetheless on high alert: “We’re not going into battle just yet, but there’s certainly a cranking of the wheels.” The same is true in Ryedale, where a potential fracking site at Kirby Misperton prompted years of protest, said Mason. The Kirby Misperton site is no longer at risk of fracking after Third Energy, the company granted the exploration licence, was taken over by the renewable energy firm the Wolfland Group. Mason is one of the company’s directors, and said they hope to use the existing wells for geothermal energy and the burial of captured carbon dioxide emissions. But other energy companies, including the chemical firm Ineos, still hold licences to frack in Yorkshire and elsewhere, said Mason, warning that protesters will be ready should the government lift the moratorium. “What we used to call geri-activists, they are more than ready to step up again,” he said. “They are local people who have done it before and will do it again to protect where they live.” Shaw said he’d start to worry if Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man and Ineos’s chief executive, started taking an interest in fracking again. “But as far as I can see, he’s not waded in. If he starts making some noise I’ll be a bit concerned.”",News/Environment,‘We’re ready’: UK anti-fracking activists prepare to fight resurgence plans ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/anti-fracking-uk-activists-fight-resurgence-plans-

3/11/2022,"British political culture is nearly as hostile to self-reflection as it is to refugees. When the Spectator splashes on Britain “failing Ukraine’s refugees”, it might consider how its previous headlines, such as “It’s time for Boris to turn back the Channel migrant boats”, helped forge a hostile environment for those fleeing war in Ukraine. Our political discourse apparently sees no problem with the former home secretary Amber Rudd, who resigned over the Windrush scandal, now grandstanding on national radio over Britain’s lack of generosity to refugees. When she declares the need for a “wholly different” approach to Ukraine’s refugees because “we’ve got war in Europe”, her sympathy for those who have been violently displaced sounds suspiciously like the British general who told the BBC that public opinion wouldn’t tolerate “people who look and live like us being slaughtered”. Rich countries in general fail in their duty of care to the people they have helped to make refugees. Britain is a particularly egregious example of this. Around 85% of refugees are sheltered by poor countries with few resources and weak infrastructure; and of those hosted by rich nations, a third are in Germany. As things stand, Britain has accepted only 300 Ukrainian refugees – compared with 1.2 million in Poland, more than 50,000 in Germany, 17,000 in Italy and 6,000 in Spain. This is all too consistent with our recent history. Boris Johnson’s dishonesty is cruder and less finessed than his predecessors, but his policy is consistent with theirs: he boasts of resettling more vulnerable people than other European countries, when just over 9,000 people were granted refuge here in 2020, five and half times fewer than in Spain alone. Demonising foreign “others” has long been a convenient means of diverting working-class anger at economic insecurity away from powerful interests. This is what drove a Conservative government to pass the Aliens Act of 1905 to keep out Jewish refugees and migrants from eastern Europe – “the native folk cannot assimilate this element”, as one Tory MP put it at the time – and for Margaret Thatcher to suggest “people are really rather afraid that this country might be swamped by people with a different culture”. Remember when David Cameron snarled that Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor “met with a bunch of migrants in Calais” and “said they could all come to Britain”? What could have possibly flashed through his mind other than the cynical idea that public fear of Afghans, Eritreans and Darfuris living in that squalid, dirty camp would drive Corbyn’s Labour into electoral oblivion’? It’s hardly a secret that much of Britain’s press is an open sewer for noxious anti-migrant views; headlines such as “Halt the asylum tide now” and “Calais: send in the army” make the public defence of refugees an act of political courage in normal times. But it can be done. When that devastating picture of Alan Kurdi, a Kurdish toddler washed up dead on a Turkish beach, reached public attention in 2015, the number of people who believed Britain should accept more refugees surged. Why? Because the dehumanisation of refugees encouraged by our politicians and media outlets was momentarily confronted: parents kissing the foreheads of their little ones at night could visualise Alan as one of their own. A large majority of Britons are now in favour of taking in thousands of Ukrainian refugees. This has put government cruelty and public opinion on a collision course. As a tide of human misery sweeps westwards, that old refugee-baiting trope – “Why can’t they just claim asylum in the first safe country?” – dissolves as rational human beings understand that a few countries alone should not shoulder this burden. The Tories now find themselves on autopilot, too ideologically inflexible to respond to the shift in public opinion and therefore indulging only the basest, most inhumane prejudices of a swath of their electorate. The opposition is not immune from these criticisms either. Labour’s shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has refused to support visa waivers for refugees; when Cooper held the same role before 2015, she indulged xenophobic sentiments with calls to strip migrants of benefits. New Labour – now the principal ideological inspiration for Keir Starmer – suggested schools had been “swamped” by non-English-speaking foreigners, and tried to ban asylum seekers’ children from schools. But Labour has another history it could draw on: when Hugh Gaitskell – himself no leftist – was the party’s leader in the early 1960s, he declared: “The Labour party is opposed to the restriction of immigration as every Commonwealth citizen has the right as a British subject to enter the country at will.” As Vladimir Putin’s criminal invasion descends into barbarism with the recent bombing of a children’s hospital, sympathy for Ukrainians will only grow. Some commentators and politicians say the quiet part out loud: that their sympathy is particularly great because these are white Europeans rather than fellow human beings in desperate need. But now is a moment to argue for a new permanent settlement – for a Britain that abandons its particularly inhumane indifference to the world’s most vulnerable and desperate people, whether they come from Ukraine, Yemen or Afghanistan. Mainstream parties have vacated the pitch, driven by electoral calculation, cynicism and cowardice, and so others must step up to offer the moral leadership that this country so desperately needs.

3/11/2022,"One of the hardest things about working with octopuses is their mood swings, says Dr Alex Schnell. They can be bold and gregarious one day, “and then the next day they refuse to come out of their den”, says the behavioural ecologist, who studies cephalopods. Octopuses are complex, intelligent creatures: they can change the colour and texture of their skin, disguise themselves, use tools and squeeze into tiny spaces. Their intricate lives burst into the public consciousness in 2020 with the Oscar-winning documentary My Octopus Teacher, about the relationship between a film-maker and an octopus. Yet while the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, may have found its way into people’s hearts, it is also now at the centre of plans by a Spanish fishing company, Nueva Pescanova, to open the world’s first commercial octopus farm in the Canary Islands next year. Demand for octopus meat is increasing – the number of octopuses caught in the wild doubled between 1980 and 2014 – but commercial octopus farming has proved elusive. From Spain and Mexico to Japan and Hawaii, companies and scientists have been working for decades to solve the myriad challenges it poses, including keeping hatchlings alive, calculating tank conditions and developing the right feed. The prize is cultivating an animal that grows quickly, reproduces easily and commands a high price. Nueva Pescanova now appears on the verge of winning this race with a facility that it claims will eventually produce 3,000 tons of octopus meat a year. The company argues that the farm will not only fulfil the growing demand for octopus meat but also relieve pressure on wild populations. More than 350,000 tonnes of octopus are caught each year in countries including China, Japan and Mexico, and wild populations are believed to be rapidly declining. Farming octopuses is necessary to “protect a species of great environmental and human value”, said a Nueva Pescanova spokesperson. Critics counter that cultivating these complex creatures would cause great suffering and replicate the harms prevalent in land-based factory farming. The UK recognised octopuses as sentient beings last year. Generally solitary animals, octopuses can become aggressive when kept in close proximity to others. Captive octopuses have been known to eat their own arms, said Dr Becca Franks, an environmental studies research scientist at New York University, and they are “renowned escape artists”, suggesting they do not like being kept in tanks. They need stimulation, said Schnell. “If they’re kept in just a barren plastic tank, they’re going to feel extremely exposed.” Schnell was part of a team of scientists behind a 2021 London School of Economics report that reviewed more than 300 scientific studies on sentience in invertebrates, including octopuses. It found “very strong evidence” of sentience in octopuses and that they can feel pain and distress, concluding: “We are convinced that high-welfare octopus farming is impossible.” While cows, pigs and other farmed animals are also sentient, much more is known about their welfare needs, said Schnell. There are no behavioural proxies for measuring octopus welfare, she said, and developing one is hard because of the significant shifts in their behaviour from day to day. Schnell is particularly concerned about how the octopuses would be killed. “There’s no reliable humane slaughter method that could be performed commercially on a large scale,” she said. A variety of methods are used to kill octopuses caught in the wild, including clubbing, slicing their brains and asphyxiation in a net. Nueva Pescanova said its facility would be “at the forefront of best practices in animal welfare and environmental sustainability” but would not specify how big the tanks would be nor how densely the octopuses would be kept, nor how its slaughter process would “avoid any pain or suffering”, as it has claimed. ‪Carlos Rosas, a biologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who is working with Nueva Pescanova, believes welfare concerns are a “distortion”. “We are trying to offer the animals the best environment because we are looking for growth,” he said. Rosas uses tubes, rocks and artificial grasses in tanks at his small-scale demonstration farm in Yucatán to mimic more natural conditions. His octopuses never escape, he said. Whether these conditions would be replicated at the industrial scale proposed by Nueva Pescanova is unclear, Rosas said. He believes octopus farming can offer economic opportunities – “in Mexico, aquaculture is an alternative for poor people who are living on the coasts” – and echoes Nueva Pescanova’s argument about relieving pressure on wild stocks. However, claims that farming can prevent overfishing are disputed. A 2019 study concluded that aquaculture did little to offset the harms of wild fishing and may even lead to a greater demand for seafood. The best way to relieve pressure on wild stocks would be to increase prices and view octopus meat as a delicacy, said Schnell. The farms may also still require wild-caught fish to feed the octopuses, further adding to pressure on the oceans. “The industry really has to justify farming carnivores, because this – from a sustainability perspective – makes zero sense,” said Jennifer Jacquet, associate professor of environmental studies at New York University. In February, dozens of animal rights activists, organised by Spain’s Animal Rights party (Pacma), gathered in the Canary Islands to protest against the new farm. “It is an obvious injustice to open a place that exploits such an exceptionally intelligent animal,” said Ana Béjar of Pacma. “You have this species that has actually been thanked at the Baftas,” said Jacquet, “and then you have this push, I mean really big push … to farm this animal.”",News/Environment,My octopus eater: critics say plans for farm are unethical and unsustainable,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/my-octopus-eater-critics-say-plans-for-farm-are-unethical-and-unsustainable
3/11/2022,"Run, Rose, RunA podcast touched by the hand of Dolly Parton is a beautiful thing. What Spotify are calling their “first Bookcast” features audio excerpts of the novel the singer has co-authored with writer James Patterson, weaving in songs from the accompanying album she’s written to go with it. Parton also takes one of the voice acting parts – a young country singer who has “big dreams and faded jeans” – delivering her role with delight. Each episode runs between four and 14 minutes; a perfect daily serving of soapy escapism. Hannah Verdier Devils in the DarkHelen Anderson and Danni Howard put a fun twist on the true-crime genre, sharing their relatable reactions to gruesome real-life tales – from outrage to confusion and even bursts of laughter. Serial killer Ed Gein is first on the menu, and the hosts aren’t afraid to wince at details such as 12 severed heads and gloves made from human flesh. HV UkrainecastLaunched on 24 February – the same day Putin invaded Ukraine – BBC journalists Victoria Derbyshire and Gabriel Gatehouse have been recording daily episodes, offering updates, first-hand accounts, expert analysis and, perhaps most importantly, an empathetic but knowledgable handling on reporting a war that is hard to track. They also welcome listeners to share questions they want unpacking. Hollie Richardson Into the MixArt, culture and activism come together in Ben & Jerry’s podcast about “joy and justice”. Ashley C Ford’s first guest is John Legend, whose views are the perfect antidote to his gentle music. He’s refreshingly outspoken about whether it’s worth putting people in jail – and why he thinks prisoners should have the vote. HV How Do You Cope? Elis James and John Robins return with a new raft of guests talking about how they’ve come through difficult times. The Rev Richard Coles’s episode is a gift as he offers his candid thoughts on death and grief after losing his husband David, and how even the thought of eternal life doesn’t offer the comfort he needs. HV Chosen by Danielle Stephens I recently got back into the habit of listening to WBUR’s Endless Thread, and their episode about a scientific war over who found a dwarf planet back in the early 2000’s, was a helpful reminder to why I enjoy zoning out of my day-to-day activities and listening to this podcast. The argument between an American and a Spanish team of astronomers, over who should receive praise for the discovery of Haumea as it drifted millions of miles away in the solar system feels like the scientific version of a true crime podcast. However, in speaking to a person on either side of the story, the investigation turns philosophical and certainly had me thinking about the way the scientific world should operate, especially when working on something that could help the whole planet. The main draw to this podcast though is the absolute genius of the sound design. Whoever works on the scoring and sound effects clearly has enough time to play and it truly shows, giving you an iteration of space sound design, you’ll never have heard the likes of before. Another internet-based quandary brought to the fore. Ever worry that you’re too invested in your relationship with the host of your favourite podcast? Try listening without headphones. After a UCLA scientist realised she felt strangely connected to This American Life host Ira Glass, she launched a study which found that you develop much more intimacy with podcast hosts when you listen in-ear rather than via speakers. The reason? You feel closer to the voices when they sound like they’re coming from inside your head. So presumably we’ve all come to subconsciously believe that we have a tiny Ira Glass living inside our brains – the plot of a podcast drama we’d love to listen to (via speakers, obviously).

3/11/2022,"The notion of rock climbing in February on an exposed crag like Laddow seemed improbable, but there we were, warm gritstone under our hands and the sun on our backs. It couldn’t last. Two ravens, wings half closed like blades on a penknife, hung above us on the strong breeze catching Laddow’s crest. That must be cold, I thought, and so it proved when we reached the top and left the crag’s shelter. Worse, as the sun crept westward, the rocks were plunged into shadow, calling time on our unseasonal adventure. So, what to do instead? A walk up Black Hill seemed the obvious choice, but I was reluctant. My last visit, many years ago, had been a grim struggle through treacly gloop, with little in the way of nature as compensation. It’s certainly a place with a mixed reputation. John Hillaby described it as “a monstrous chocolate cake”. Alfred Wainwright, who had a particular animus against Black Hill, saw “a desolate and hopeless quagmire”. Wainwright blamed nature for this, but the true culprit was 19th-century air pollution that poisoned the vegetation. Despite all this, it soon became clear that something rather magical has happened to Black Hill. There’s a lovely spot called Red Ratcher, where the moors fold into each other like rumpled silk, and here I paused, looking towards Dun Hill – the slope before the top of Black Hill. There’s no heather here, but rather an even flow of cotton grass that spreads like the steppe in all directions, a dome of liberating space that we now traversed. But the real surprise came at the summit, reached along a sturdy sequence of gritstone slabs that delivered us – dry-shod! – to a landscape utterly changed, and for the better. Almost two decades of restoration work, by the estimable Moors for the Future, has turned a hilltop once stripped of life into a vibrant green oasis. Best of all, close to the trig point, was a flush of sphagnum moss – a sure sign that the tide has turned. The black hill is black no longer.
