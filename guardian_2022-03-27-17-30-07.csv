3/27/2022,"Boris Johnson is expected to hold crunch talks with senior cabinet ministers this week to resolve fractious talks over plans to tackle rising bills and boost the country’s energy security. The government’s energy strategy has been delayed by cabinet splits over onshore wind, funding for nuclear energy and the role fracking should play given spiralling energy prices and the Ukraine invasion. It is understood that major disagreements still remain between the prime minister, chancellor Rishi Sunak and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary. The cabinet tensions have only grown since the chancellor’s spring statement last week, which drew criticism for failing to do enough on the cost of living. Sunak now faces pressure from Number 10 to sanction spending on new nuclear power and renewables projects. Kwarteng’s department is said to be keen on schemes that would boost onshore wind by giving energy bill discounts for those who live near turbines – a scheme that has been run successfully by Octopus Energy. The prime minister is also said to favour accelerating the creation of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) produced by Rolls-Royce, but Sunak has been warning about the long-term costs involved in a big expansion of nuclear power. Voters now regard energy as the second most important issue facing the UK, even ahead of the economy. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer found that 48% of voters flagged it as an important issue, up 17 points from a month ago. Only health and the NHS are greater concerns. The disputes are rumbling on alongside concerns that some of the help already offered by the chancellor on household bills will not reach vulnerable households. The Observer has been told that more than a million households are set to miss out on one of the main measures. An official assessment of its much-vaunted £150 council tax rebate predicted that 1.3m households won’t receive it. In its assessment of the spring statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that a fifth of those who did not pay their council tax by direct debit would not take up the rebate, thereby saving the exchequer £195m. Local councils warned they had not been given the resources to deliver the rebate. The most vulnerable households are more likely to be among those who do not receive the tax cut automatically. The government has said it is the job of local councils to ensure that those who do not receive the rebate automatically do not miss out. However, the Observer has seen pleas from councils to ministers that they have not been given the resources to help them ensure no one misses out. One council leader said distributing the rebate would cost it “in the region of £450,000, with no government funding to assist”. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “It is staggering that more than a million families are set to miss out because of this Conservative government’s half-baked plans. Often those who don’t pay council tax by direct debit are older and more deprived, meaning some of these households are likely to be among the most vulnerable in the country. “People are facing sky-rocketing bills and plummeting living standards, but it looks like even the meagre support on offer from the Conservatives won’t reach those who need it most. Rishi Sunak must confirm that anyone who misses out on the rebate will get their £150 cheque in the post. No one should go without the help they need because of this Conservative government’s incompetence.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Direct debit is the quickest and easiest way to pay council tax, and the best way for most people to get the rebate. Councils are responsible for making sure eligible households who don’t pay their council tax by direct debit receive the rebate and we have suggested a range of payment options. With the support of councils, we are confident that all those eligible for a rebate will receive their payments in good time.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson to confront bitter Tory splits over UK energy strategy and bills,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills
3/27/2022,"Sovereignty, we are told, matters. It matters in Ukraine. It matters in Brexit. And, for some, the freedom afforded by sovereignty in the one instance is analogous to that afforded in the other. Many of those who celebrate sovereignty against Russian invaders or EU impositions become silent, however, when Britain is the power denying the right of people to determine the future of their country. Last week, the British government amended the nationality and borders bill to allow Chagos Islanders to apply for British nationality. What the islanders want is not to be British but to have sovereignty over their own lands. To that, Britain remains obdurately opposed. Between 1967 and 1973, Britain forcibly deported the entire population of the Chagos Islands, in the Indian Ocean, to make way for a US military base. Most of the exiled islanders now live in poverty and destitution. Britain’s refusal to allow Chagossians to return to their homes has been deemed illegal by the international court of justice. But sovereignty, it seems, only matters in certain cases. Sovereignty does not seem to matter when it comes to Britain’s past any more than it does in the present. Last week, the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, demanded a “balanced” debate about the British empire. The “positives” must be taught as well as the “negatives” and “both sides of the story” must be told. Badenoch’s argument is part of a long tradition of viewing the British empire as different from other empires, as essentially benign and which, despite the occasional excesses of violence, was largely positive for those who were colonised. But what about sovereignty? What about the rights and views of those who were colonised? Sovereignty, apologists for empire argue, did not apply to the peoples Britain colonised, because they were “backward” and needed first to be brought into the modern world through British rule. As the icon of Victorian liberalism John Stuart Mill wrote in On Liberty: “Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians provided that the end be their improvement.” It’s a perspective that still finds adherents today. Nigel Biggar, a professor of theology at Oxford University and director of the Ethics and Empire project, insists that the British empire shows why it is wrong “to assume that domination is an intrinsically bad thing”. Similarly, Bruce Gilley, an associate professor of political science at Portland State University in Oregon, has made “The Case for Colonialism”, calling for the “abandonment of the myth of selfgoverning capacity”. Those who were subject to British imperial rule were not so sanguine about the value of “domination”. In the 19th century, the historian Caroline Elkins observes: “There were 250 separate armed conflicts in the British empire, with at least one in any given year.” Elkins’s magnificent history of the British empire, Legacy of Violence, published last week, shows that far from being exceptional and benign, the empire was saturated in violence. Elkins spells out in gruesome detail the savagery meted out to those who had the temerity to assert their sovereignty. In Kenya, British soldiers “tied suspects to vehicle bumpers with just enough rope to drag them to death. They employed burning cigarettes, fire and hot coals. They thrust bottles (often broken), gun barrels, knives, snakes, vermin, sticks and hot eggs up men’s rectums and into women’s vaginas. They crushed bones and teeth; sliced off fingers or their tips; and castrated men with specially designed instruments.” And all part of what Elkins calls the “legalised lawlessness” that saturated the empire. This is why “balance” can look very different in Britain’s former colonies than it does in Britain. Something that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge discovered last week. Their official tour of the Caribbean was meant to be a charm offensive to celebrate the Queen’s platinum jubilee and to dissuade other Caribbean states from joining Barbados in ditching the monarchy. They have faced protests, demands for an apology and reparations over slavery and calls for Jamaica, too, to become a republic. For some, the fault lies (inevitably) with the Duchess of Sussex and her “propagandists” for “the damage she’s caused to the Commonwealth”. Those with a perspective broader than a Meghan-obsession might recognise that the turbulence of the royal trip is a sign of changing relationships and shifting attitudes. “What makes the importance of the Commonwealth,” the Spectator declared in 1957, “is its moral status [as] the only western organisation to throw a bridge between the European people and their ex-subjects of Africa and Asia.” The Commonwealth, it added, “is the only western answer so far produced to the Soviet ‘nationalities’ policy… which gave Russia a flying start in dealing with peoples emerging from colonialism”. The cold war is no more. And the world that gave meaning to the Commonwealth is slipping away. Today, China, not Britain, or even America, is the burgeoning power in the Caribbean. As global alliances have shifted, so too have attitudes to Britain and to empire. Politicians and the elites in former colonies are as adept as those in Britain at wielding stories about the past to buttress their rule in the present. Questions of slavery and reparations and empire are often used to deflect attention from economic mismanagement and political corruption. That does not take away from the brutal realities of colonial rule in the Caribbean. Nor from the coercive nature of the relationship with Britain even today. One place the royal couple did not visit in Jamaica was the Open Arms Drop-In Centre, even though it is funded by Britain through its aid budget. It lies at the end of a dirt road in downtown Kingston and houses more than 70 homeless men. Britain provides money to reserve beds for deportees from this country. Most are victims of the “hostile environment”, many are casualties of the Windrush scandal and almost all are destitute, having grown up in Britain with few connections on the island. They are simply dumped there by British immigration laws. What Jamaicans think matters little, for here, too, there is little concern with “sovereignty”. Sovereignty certainly matters. But it matters not just when it is politically convenient. Sovereignty matters in Ukraine. It matters in the Chagos Islands. And it matters in how we should think about the British empire. That is a “balanced” view.

3/27/2022,"I’m still in North Norfolk, this time in Holt, a delightful little town. The first time I came here there was a ‘wanted’ poster in Bakers & Larners (amazing department store) asking for information about a broken plant pot with a reward of £250. What a pot it must have been. Who put up the reward? I’m still asking this question. Because the whole town is so picture perfect and delightful, I once asked one of the artists in her local workshop if there was any scandal, because there must be ruffles under the smooth surface. ‘Oh yes,’ she said as she looked up from her creation, ‘a little while ago there was someone writing poison pen letters.’ The quiet towns are always the worst. Walking past Casa Blanca, an Iberian gourmet shop, I spied inside a woman, with an actual saw, sawing something, her arm reaching high up into the ceiling to get leverage. You have to go into a shop like this. Among the wonderful Spanish fare – Iberico ham, pâtés, gorgeous sardines in tins, cheeses, spices, Torres crisps (fabulous) – I spied Butter Bike peanut butter, which is very much not Spanish. It’s made in Devon and in flavours I’d never seen before: cinnamon raisin, gingerbread, smoked chilli and… chocolate, £4.50 (285g). All of which I wanted to try but, of course, I settled on the chocolate one thinking ‘meh it will be OK’ but, readers! It was beautiful. So thick; so really, really tasty. A new favourite.

3/27/2022,"You need a lot of patience to watch contemporary dance, staring hard as unfathomable things unfold, hoping for revelation. You never know in advance whether light will break through, or whether you will be stuck in the clouds of uncomprehending irritation for ever. Dance Reflections, the new festival sponsored by French jewellery house Van Cleef & Arpels, has proved the point. It has undoubtedly been a good thing, bringing new work (a lot of it French) and excellent modern dance revivals to London. But it has also tested the viewer’s staying power in pieces such as Gisèle Vienne’s This Is How You Will Disappear, in which nothing happened in a very foggy wood for a very long time. Its clunky dialogue – “If you do not do this perfectly, I will kill you and throw your body in the river” – and the non-appearance of the birds promised in the programme (replaced by dogs) made it almost unendurable. The revival of Lucinda Childs’s early experimental pieces by her niece Ruth Childs and three talented dancers offered different challenges. The works have a mesmeric, repetitive quality as part of their DNA. In Calico Mingling, the intricate pattern of repeated movement grips and binds; other pieces such as Reclining Rondo are so slow and transfixing that they become soporific. Boris Charmatz, darling of radical dance, was the week’s main attraction and his first offering, a solo called Somnole, was also a meditation on sleep, or at least those boundaries between sleeping and waking when the body and mind take on a life of their own. Charmatz, dressed in a pleated, patterned skirt, whistled as he danced, sometimes tunelessly, sometimes with snatches of a tune from the Pink Panther to spaghetti westerns. Sometimes he made bird noises, as his movement ricocheted from the still and grounded to the frenetic. Padding, skipping, running, raising himself on his elbows in a back stand, nearly dozing off before throwing himself into a frantic tap dance, he was always utterly compelling. His cleverness and curiosity were on full display in the group work Infini too, which took place on the Sadler’s Wells main stage, with half the audience sitting at the back. It takes the idea of counting – which dominates the way most dancers remember steps – and turns it on its head, so that the repetitive sequences become explorations of mathematics, philosophy, and history. The constant numbers are accompanied by movement from Charmatz and four exceptional dancers that seems erratic but recalls the classical origins of dance and also, as the 70 minutes progress, reveals its own shape and pattern, travelling from joyous to frightened, as the light turns yellow and the dancers cling together in shifting tableau. It’s a challenging piece, made more so by Yves Godin’s lighting, which relies mainly on constantly revolving and very bright light. But its austere oddities finally come together in a conclusion that is thoughtful and somehow just. It’s a piece to admire rather than love, but definitely worth the attention it demands.

3/27/2022,"Last Friday morning, a group of Tory advisers, including Boris Johnson’s new deputy chief of staff, David Canzini, held a meeting at Conservative party headquarters to discuss political strategy. A self-styled hard man who uses the name @DCGrumpy on Twitter, Canzini was one of those brought in to Downing Street a few weeks ago to sort the place out after “partygate”, and resurrect Johnson’s fortunes. “Canzini is one of Lynton Crosby’s people,” said a party source, referring to the veteran Australian election guru who worked with Johnson on his successful 2008 mayoral campaign in London. “They think Ukraine has changed everything, taken the focus off partygate. They think, with the war, that everything can move on, and they get him re-elected in 2023 or 2024.” Over the past few weeks, Canzini has been telling Tory advisers that Brexit and measures to deal with the soaring cost of living should be the two top domestic priorities for the Johnson government. Advisers say the theory seems to be that the supposed benefits of leaving the EU, including freedoms over setting taxes such as VAT, can help ease the current economic pain caused by inflation, giving a domestic coherence to the Johnson administration that it has struggled so far to find. In Friday’s strategy session, there was discussion of how their ministers should best take these messages to the country. But the mood was subdued. The reason was that the process of “relaunching” Johnson and his government around domestic themes had just hit a major bump in the road, in the form of Rishi Sunak’s spring statement two days before. Before he rose to address MPs at 12.40pm on Wednesday, Sunak’s set-piece had been billed as the moment when the Tory government would show it cared about people struggling to pay their energy and food bills, as inflation headed skywards. But – despite its enthusiastic initial reception by Conservative MPs in the chamber – within hours of Sunak sitting down, it was clear the statement had bombed, both in the party and out in the country. By Thursday and Friday, even normally ultra-loyal Tory newspapers were accusing the chancellor of having failed to rise to the moment and grasp the gravity of the cost of living crisis. The Express ran a headline on its front page on Thursday asking what on earth had gone wrong for the man who, only weeks ago, was hailed as Johnson’s likely successor: “The forgotten millions say: what about us?” it said. Tory MPs observed that Sunak’s chances of ever being prime minister appeared to have just gone up in smoke while Labour claimed that privileged Conservatives such as Sunak – one of the richest men in politics – simply could not identify with real people. “I don’t want to get all class war about this,” a shadow cabinet minister said on Thursday “but it did look a bit like the rich boys think this crisis in people’s lives is all just a political game.” Before the statement, there had been tensions within the cabinet over what it should contain. Several senior ministers, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities, had wanted Sunak to cut spending to reduce inflation. Johnson, on the other hand, is said to have wanted more help for people with their mounting energy bills. But Sunak wanted to hold down spending in order to cut taxes closer to a general election, and stood firm to his own plan. What emerged was a set of offerings and political messages that satisfied almost no one. A 5p cut in fuel duty and a rise in the threshold at which national insurance will kick in were among measures for those struggling to get by. But the NI move raised questions about why Sunak had opted in his spending review last autumn to raise it by 1.25% from April – a plan that remains in place. The biggest hole in Sunak’s plan, however, was that there was nothing for millions of people who are self-evidently suffering most – those on benefits. “It did not sit well with us being all about levelling up,” said a former Tory minister afterwards. Despite demands for the chancellor to increase benefits by the rate of inflation, or near to it (such a move would have cost a few billion pounds if implemented for just one year), he did nothing: benefits and pensions for millions will go up by 3.1% next month as already stated, with inflation heading towards 8%. Political motives were clearly at play. In an attempt to appease Tory MPs who accuse him of being a high-tax chancellor, Sunak held back about £20bn of cash in his war chest for a 1p income tax cut – but not until 2024, the probable year of the next general election. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the chancellor’s actions would offset only about a quarter of the tax rises he had announced last October and warned that living standards would fall by 2.2% over the coming tax year – the biggest fall since the 1950s. What had been intended as an occasion to ease the pain had served merely to advertise the enormity of the cost of living crisis, increase national anxiety, and demonstrate the government’s inability to respond. Out in the real world away from Westminster, those Tory MPs who took seats from Labour in 2019 had particular reason to worry. Johnson had led the Tories to victory and broken down the “red wall” in that election on promises to level up the country and deliver Brexit dividends to working people. One such red wall seat is West Bromwich East, now held by Conservative MP Nicola Richards, having before been a Labour stronghold. The constituency contains some of the poorest communities in the UK. Nearly a third of children live in relative poverty, according to government figures from 2019/20, which are likely to have risen further since then as household incomes have become squeezed. In some postcodes, more than 60% of children are living in poverty. On Friday, Keith Turner, the manager of a local food bank which he set up in West Bromwich community church in 2007, said demand was rising all the time. “Most people round here are on a hiding to nothing,” he said. “People are usually on prepayment meters, which are more expensive, and the rising energy costs are going to be a killer. That’s only going to get worse.” He says it is not just food bank users who are feeling the pressure caused by rising prices – but those who run them, too. His team of about eight volunteers take donations from the local community, but nowadays they are not enough and they have to supplement them by buying in additional supplies. “When things are going up by 30p each, it doesn’t sound much on each individual item but it adds up to a significant extra cost to us,” says Turner. He was disappointed by the lack of help for low earners in Sunak’s statement. “They need to take a serious look at the benefits system,” he said. “It’s being propped up by food banks. The government and civil servants must have the brains and talent to understand that it’s not fit for purpose.” Outside the nearby jobcentre, Alexander, a single man living in a shared house, explained that he had £250 a month to live on after paying his rent. “I’m looking for work picking and packing but there’s nothing in West Bromwich. I don’t drive, and the buses don’t run early or late enough to places like Oldbury and Wolverhampton, where all the work is. I can get by at the moment but I don’t know how much longer I can live like this.” Sophia Bright, a single mother of two children aged four and six, said inflation was hitting her hard and eroding the income from her job at a bakery. “I’m lucky that I can work and my mum can look after the kids but everything is so hard with only one income. There’s a lot of talk about looking after ‘hardworking families’ but you just know they don’t mean my kind of family, because if they did, there’d be more support. “When you’re the only one working and you have kids to feed and clothe and keep warm, it’s almost impossible. My rent has just gone up nearly 10% because the landlord said his costs have risen. “I could barely afford heating before and my flat is small – now food is going up as well and I don’t have anyone to split the cost with. There’s no one more hardworking than a single mum, and the government doesn’t seem to care.” While she did not vote at the last election, she did vote against Brexit, which she now believes is the primary cause of rising prices. West Bromwich East had one of the highest proportions of leave voters in the UK, with 68% voting to come out of the EU in 2016. Bright thinks lots of people have now changed their minds. “All my friends voted for Brexit and I think now they’re regretting it. I don’t think they’d vote the same again now. I tried to warn them but they didn’t listen – and now look where we f***ing are.” The latest Opinium poll for the Observer on Sunday finds that 58% of voters think Brexit is helping to push prices up in the shops against just 8% who do not: 49% think it is damaging the economy as a whole, while 16% do not. And 68% think the government should be doing more to ease the cost of living crisis. The danger for Johnson and his government is that these perceptions take deeper root in the coming months as the cost of living crisis intensifies. As we report today, huge battles now lie ahead, with millions of public sector workers demanding pay rises that match or exceed inflation. The unions are warning that people will leave their jobs in the NHS, teaching or the civil service unless they receive pay rises that allow them to maintain their standard of living, and reward them for getting the country through the pandemic. But Sunak – who offered nothing to people on benefits – has signalled the need for pay restraint to avoid an inflationary spiral. The two sides are miles apart. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, told the Observer on Sunday that the country is at a tipping point. Using unusually strong language, she says: “Many public sector workers across services like health, education and social care say they don’t know if they can take it any more. If they don’t at least get a proper pay rise and help to reduce workloads, it will be the final straw.” Already since Wednesday there are signs that the cost of living crisis is dividing No 10 and the Treasury as a blame game rages over the bungled spring statement. Splits are appearing across government on wider fronts. In the coming fortnight, the government is due to set out its new energy strategy to achieve independence from oil and gas supplies from overseas, including Russia, and to gain more control over energy costs as a result. But the issue is prising apart Johnson’s cabinet, with ministers at loggerheads over the extent to which renewable energy projects, such as wind farms, should be increased, and nuclear power stations expanded. Suddenly the challenges facing Johnson have changed. The crisis over parties has been replaced by another that directly affects millions of people who struggle to pay their bills. As another Tory ex-minister put it on Thursday, that kind of crisis is far more dangerous for the Conservative party as a whole. “If we really think we are in a better place than we were a few weeks ago, we are deluding ourselves.”",News/Politics,After partygate: Tory government goes from crisis to crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/27/after-partygate-tory-government-goes-from-crisis-to-crisis
3/27/2022,"This is not the book that Sarah Hughes intended it to be. Aged just 46, the journalist learned that her recently treated breast cancer had not only returned and spread, it had become incurable. She went on to defy statistics and live with it for more than two years (the median is just 11 months) but it wasn’t long enough to complete the work she had originally outlined. And yet, while they’re clearly as nothing compared with some of her life’s other incomplete endeavours – most poignantly, the raising of her two children – missing chapters such as Financial Advice from an Unrepentant Gambler and The Secret Lives of Catholic Saints are also fully eclipsed by what she did manage to achieve. Here is a volume that packs in wisdom and wit, grace and frivolity. It isn’t purely a cancer book, either. Yes, it’s broadly about living with the disease, dying from it even – a neglected topic, she observes – but these memoiristic essays also yomp across food and high fashion, bonkbusters and box sets. Equally, though she allows for sorrow, her voice and insights – her sheer elan – set them soaring. “From an early age I was obsessed by death,” begins her opening essay, It’s My Funeral and I’ll Cry If I Want To. As a quick-tempered child, she was prone to flouncing off and indulging in melodramatic fantasies about how devastated her family would be were she to die. Fuelled by reading Dickens and Edgar Allan Poe, these imaginings later extended to gothic funerals, and as an adult, she’d ponder who among her circle of intimates might die young. Then “death, the dancer I had tempted and taunted all my life, finally heeded my invitation and knocked at my door”. It’s a striking image – rueful, edgy, and with a supernatural tinge somehow evocative of her childhood Catholicism, a faith she kept. Those same traits surge through a powerful essay about the stillbirth of her third child and the miscarriage of a fourth the following year. She’s come to think of the pair as her “shadow children”, she explains. Her writing never fails to console, but it does so without cushioning reality’s jagged edges. In Scars, she yields to an atavistic need to “bear witness”, standing before a mirror late at night and surveying her changed body. Among its “trophies” are pale lines that testify to a teen flirtation with cutting during a miserable spell at a private school. Some of her classmates were much more serious about it, and she admits to feeling shame for having appropriated their coping mechanisms instead of trying to help. Occasionally, however, it’s acceptance that washes over her when she sees those scars. As she notes: “Teenagers should feel things strongly”. Throughout, she is bracingly candid. Upon learning that her cancer had metastasised, for instance, her first thought was that she didn’t want to leave her husband and children. Her second? That she may never find out how Game of Thrones ends – the books, not the TV adaptation she blogged about, earning the nickname “Lady Sarah” among her many fans. It’s to books that she turns again and again in challenging moments – invariably titles that a less expansive reader might be snobby about. As a teen, for instance, she found Virginia Andrews epiphanic. Later, Jackie Collins taught her that you can only get from life what you put in. And when her illness was first diagnosed, it was Jilly Cooper that she reached for. Interspersed with these nine essays are chapters written by friends, including professional writers, offering glimpses of Hughes at various stages of life – at boarding school and the University of St Andrews; starting out as a journalist in Manchester before moving to London and contributing widely to both this newspaper and the Guardian; falling in love and living in New York. Though they inevitably have the ring of eulogies, sometimes jangling oddly with the vivacity of her prose, they demonstrate how those close to her have taken her words to heart – words whose sustaining message is summed up by the book’s title: Holding Tight, Letting Go. It is a book about letting go, and in that respect is as much for the dying as it is for those who love them. But it’s also about holding tight to each moment of pleasure, even when those moments endure only in memory. It’s Hughes’s talent for doing just that that blazes most brightly from these pages.

3/27/2022,"Over the course of three albums since her 2014 self-titled debut, New Zealand singer-songwriter Aldous Harding has found a musical identity in sonic shapeshifting. Harnessing her voice like a ventriloquist’s puppet, Harding’s releases have traversed everything from pensive, finger-picking folk on 2019’s The Barrel to gothic piano balladry on 2017’s Imagining My Man and wistful spoken word on 2014’s Beast. Her latest, Warm Chris, is perhaps her most genre-focused work – 10 tracks of mid-tempo, folk-adjacent introspection – allowing for greater attention towards her musicality. Opener Ennui expertly pairs a tripping major chord progression on the piano with Harding’s languorous vocals, expressing the restless boredom of its title. Singles Fever and Lawn, meanwhile, fit into poppier territory, with the former’s earworming chorus and the latter’s hip-swaying rhythm. Focus doesn’t belie experimentalism, though. Lawn features Harding singing in what sounds like a helium-induced pitch, while Passion Babe takes on a nonchalant, valley-girl drawl. Closer Leathery Whip features the eerie, surrealist refrain: “here comes life with his leathery whip”.

3/27/2022,"Rishi Sunak has battled to protect the Treasury from rising prices while allowing inflation to ravage the finances of low and middle-income households. That is the accusation levelled at the chancellor after a spring budget statement that put government debt reduction ahead of calls for extra welfare support for hard-pressed families. Sunak’s dilemma, as inflation heads towards 8% and possibly beyond, is whether he can afford to increase the Treasury’s outlay on welfare and public services, including public sector pay. His team believes that the Treasury needs to keep a large fund in reserve to pay higher debt costs, much of which is linked to inflation. A proportion of the UK’s debt is held by lenders in the form of index-linked bonds. The more inflation rises, the higher the interest rate the government must pay. Then there is the £875bn of government debt held by the Bank of England – equal to more than a third of the total – which until last year carried an interest rate of just 0.1%. Central bank officials are attempting to limit the rise in inflation by increasing borrowing costs. Two rate rises later, and the annual interest rate stands at 0.75%, raising Sunak’s debt bill further. Figures covering the public finances in February show inflation pushed up interest payments on government debt by more than 50% to £8.2bn, the highest February figure on record. Yet debts costs remain at historic lows as a proportion of the government’s budget, which is a better measure of its ability to pay. In the 1980s, debt interest cost the government about 10% of annual revenues. Today that figure is below 3%, despite a debt mountain that has more than doubled in relation to national income over that time. In addition, UK government debt is still highly sought after by international investors, meaning they are prepared to accept low returns over long periods. And there is little prospect of recent increases in inflation being sustained over the longer time horizons used by the Treasury to judge the nation’s financial stability. Inflation will fall back this year and next because fuel prices are the biggest impetus for rising prices. Inflation is also kinder to the chancellor than it is to businesses or households. It increases his income from VAT. There is also a boost from wage rises that are slightly larger than forecast a year ago, which generates more income tax. Adding an estimated £21bn to his stockpile is a freeze on income tax thresholds set to last four years. In the meantime, soaring gas prices and the higher cost of petrol and diesel will eat into business and household incomes with only limited compensation from higher incomes or government support. In truth, much of the Treasury reserve fund is being kept back to fund tax cuts ahead of the next election, when much of it could be used to prevent more than 1.3 million people – including half a million children – from being pushed below the poverty line next year.",News/UK news,Rishi Sunak ‘protecting Treasury from inflation at families’ expense’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/27/rishi-sunak-protecting-treasury-from-inflation-at-families-expense
3/27/2022,"When a much-loved author dies, fans and publishers cling for a while to the hope that an undiscovered manuscript lurks in a drawer, promising a final echo of that familiar voice. So last week’s news that a collected volume of John le Carré’s letters will be published in November understandably sent a frisson through the literary world. Le Carré achieved the rare double of popular and critical acclaim, but his life offered as much intrigue as any of his plots: his fraudster father; the formative years in the intelligence services; the glittering literary and film career; the vocal political engagement. There’s also his longevity: the letters span the decades from his 1940s childhood to the days before his death in December 2020, aged 89. Few people could be as well placed to offer such a comprehensive first-hand account of recent history. But that’s not why we’re so fascinated by the prospect of a writer’s private correspondence. In her 1940 essay The Humane Art, Virginia Woolf observes that “the letter writer is no surreptitious historian… he speaks not to the public at large but to the individual in private”. What we want from a collection of letters is a glimpse behind the curtain, a sense of who that person was among friends and family. Le Carré had already produced a memoir, but the letters promise a different kind of intimacy: a more dynamic sense of his personal relationships and the exchange of ideas. But can a letter ever offer a truly unvarnished portrait and would we really want one? A writer with a career as eminent as Le Carré’s will have known that his correspondence would be a valuable part of his legacy and the forthcoming collection has been edited by his son Tim Cornwell, so while there may be curiosities and surprises, it seems unlikely that we will encounter anything that might demand a re-evaluation of the life. Private letters might give the illusion of eavesdropping on a conversation, but a written correspondence, even to close friends, can be as much of a performance as anything intended for publication, particularly for a writer who must have “sometimes looked over his page at the distant horizon”, as Woolf puts it. Recently, at a friend’s funeral, the celebrant quoted that famous line of Philip Larkin’s: “What will survive of us is love.” It’s a comforting sentiment, taken at face value, but Larkin’s sardonic poem Posterity offers a more brutally honest view of what we leave behind; he imagines his future biographer, bored in a US archive: “I’m stuck with this old fart at least a year.” Certainly, Larkin’s own copious letters have ensured that what survives of him is a picture of a resentful, emotionally constipated misanthrope with unpalatable opinions – and that’s after 30 volumes of his private papers were shredded at his instruction, so we can only imagine what was in those. And, of course, we do. There’s always a sense of outrage at the idea of a writer’s words being destroyed to keep them from the public, even (especially) when it’s the author’s own decision, as if we, the readers, had a God-given right to scrutinise their every utterance. Perhaps another reason for the excitement about Le Carré’s letters is that he belongs to one of the last generations who will leave behind such a rich trove of correspondence in this form. Even in 1940, Woolf was lamenting the decline of letter-writing in the face of new modes of communication. “The wireless and the telephone have intervened,” she complains, predicting that “instead of letters posterity will have confessions, diaries, notebooks… in which the writer talks in the dark to himself about himself…” She might have been anticipating social media. Letters have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity recently precisely because they are a dying art and we miss them. Shaun Usher’s wonderful Letters of Note website, and its subsequent books and live shows, tapped into a nostalgia for a more thoughtful way of communicating. It’s possible, I suppose, that decades after the leading writers of my generation are dead, actors will read out their collected WhatsApp exchanges on stage, but it’s unlikely to have the same impact. My generation is also the last that can hope to find forgotten caches of letters in the attic after our parents are gone, like those that inspired Simon Garfield’s 2015 book My Dear Bessie, a wartime love story pieced together from surviving correspondence. It makes me wonder what I’ll leave behind for my son to edit if I live another 40 years. There are specialist services now that advise on leaving digital assets to your beneficiaries, although bequeathing him my phone passcode so he can access a handful of regrettable sexts from years ago isn’t quite the same as stumbling across an old shoebox of yellowing love letters tied up in ribbon. Most of my exchanges with fellow writers now take place on Twitter and that technology will no doubt become obsolete in time. And yet it is a shame, when I consider some of the brilliant writers I know, to think that there will be nothing left to discover in their archives because we’ve all grown so used to blurting our every thought in public on a platform that won’t endure. Perhaps it’s not too late to revive the humane art of letter-writing. If I start now, given the state of Royal Mail, some of them might even arrive in time to be published posthumously.
