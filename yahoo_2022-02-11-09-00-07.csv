2/11/2022,"The financier famed for bankrolling some of Steve Bannon’s best-known ventures, as well as the far-right strategist’s jet-setting lifestyle, is in deep trouble for steering a $28 million yacht—the same boat where federal agents arrested Bannon in 2020—out of American waters. A New York judge slapped Guo Wengui, who also uses the aliases Kwok Ho Wan and Miles Guo, with $134 million in contempt of court fines on Wednesday for violating multiple restraining orders barring him from selling or relocating the boat or any other property he controls. The high price tag results from nearly a year of the fugitive Chinese national defying the court’s order that he return the craft to a U.S. port—an order that carried a daily forfeiture of $500,000. Court documents filed in late January showed the 151-foot-long pleasure vessel blithely plying the western Mediterranean. Now, Guo has only until Monday to come up with the funds. His attorneys at BakerHostetler—a firm with close ties to the Republican National Committee—declined to comment for this story. The punishing penalties result from a case unrelated to Bannon’s maritime arrest a year and a half ago for allegedly looting a nonprofit, a charge for which he never faced prosecution thanks to a last-minute pardon from outgoing President Donald Trump. Rather, the fines are connected to a separate fight over Guo’s enigmatic yet ostentatious wealth. Nearly five years ago, an affiliate of the Hong Kong-based investment firm Pacific Alliance Group brought suit against Guo, alleging his companies had failed to repay tens of millions of dollars in loans made between 2008 and 2009 or deliver on promised property transactions. The opulent boat has emerged as a key asset in that fight over the allegedly unpaid tab. The Messy Money Drama Behind Steve Bannon’s Propaganda Machine Guo, a Shandong-born construction magnate, absconded from the Chinese mainland in 2014, fleeing charges ranging from corruption and money-laundering to rape (all of which he has denied). Since 2017, he has lived in luxury, setting up residence in a $68 million Central Park penthouse and underwriting numerous right-wing projects, from nonprofits with Bannon to dodgy media operations to bogus COVID-19 studies to would-be Twitter competitor GETTR. All the while, he has sought refugee status and attacked figures in both the Communist Chinese regime and in the dissident diaspora online. The yacht imbroglio is hardly the first time Guo’s activities have run afoul of U.S. authorities. In September 2021, his companies agreed to pay half-a-billion dollars in Security and Exchange Commission fines for running a cryptocurrency scheme in violation of federal regulations.

2/11/2022,"A federal judge took aim at the Republican National Committee’s recent distortion of reality during sentencing for a violent Capitol rioter. “It is not ‘legitimate political discourse,’” Judge Amy Berman Jackson said during her Thursday sentencing of Mark Leffingwell, who will spend six months in prison for assaulting police at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 last year. Jackson was referring to the RNC’s description of the riot that left five people dead and more than 140 officers injured as “legitimate political discourse” when the group censured two of their own party members last week for daring to suggest that the Capitol attack was, in fact, an attack. The RNC censured Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) for participating in the House committee investigating the attack. “Representatives Cheney and Kinzinger are participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse,” the resolution said. In her sentencing of Leffingwell, a 52-year-old Seattle man who pleaded guilty to assaulting two cops, Jackson said disinformation continues to be amplified. “The heated rhetoric that got you riled up and brought you to Washington, D.C., has not subsided,” Jackson said in her sentencing. “Disinformation is not only available, it’s getting louder and louder every day. You weren’t the only person to fall for it or to embrace it, and some have embraced it who don’t even believe it. The lie that the election was stolen and illegitimate is still being perpetrated. Indeed, it is being amplified, not only on social media but on mainstream news outlets, and worse, it’s become heresy for a member of the former president’s party to say otherwise.” Jackson added that the attack was “at the direction” of Trump himself. “So, it needs to be crystal clear that it is not patriotism,” she said. “It is not standing up for America. It is not ‘legitimate political discourse,’ and it is not justified to descend on the nation’s Capitol at the direction of a disappointed candidate and disrupt the national process.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/11/2022,"Under the watchful eye of his 4,409 lbs mother, the 3-month old calf named ""Stark"" cautiously observed the other species including zebras and giraffes in the large plains-like enclosure at Burgers' Zoo in Arnhem. Stark, a square-lipped rhinoceros, was born in late October but the zoo waited until he was three months old before introducing him to the large outdoor area at the zoo. Burgers' Zoo spokesman Bas Lukkenaar said keepers wanted to be sure the calf - which weighed around 100 lbs at birth and now is more than 440 lbs - would be robust enough in case of a ""skirmish"" between the wild animals. Stark will remain in Arnhem until he is about 3 years old, when he will be transferred to another zoo as part of a European breeding program.",Science/Reuters Videos,Baby rhino has first introduction to other animals,https://news.yahoo.com/baby-rhino-first-introduction-other-173508669.html
