3/8/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy is the president of Ukraine and also, I regret to inform you, the internet’s latest heart-throb. TikTok is awash with “fancams” lusting over the man, and the always classy New York Post has published headlines such as: “Women go wild for ‘thirst trap’ Ukrainian President.” A recent viral tweet similarly declared: “BREAKING: every woman in your life now has at least a small crush on Volodymyr Zelenskiy and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it.” It is natural to admire Zelenskiy’s poise and bravery amid the invasion of Ukraine. But there is a difference between respecting a politician and sexualising or worshipping them. Idolising politicians is questionable during the best of times but doing it in the midst of a bloody war is highly problematic. Idolising wartime leaders can help glamorise conflict and perpetuate dangerously simplistic narratives of good versus evil. Treating a head of state like he’s a member of a boyband also risks trivialising what is happening in Ukraine. Not to mention, it’s just embarrassing. The lust around Zelenskiy may be cringeworthy, but it’s also depressingly predictable. Remember the beginning of the pandemic, when large swathes of self-proclaimed “Cuomosexuals” in the US fawned over Andrew Cuomo, the then governor of New York? (This did not age well: Cuomosexuals had to hawk their “I have a crush on Cuomo” coffee cups on eBay after the governor had a very dramatic fall from grace.) Remember all the erotic fan fiction about Pete and Chasten Buttigieg? Remember Rahmbamarama – the fanfiction community for people who worshipped president Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff? “Fandom” has well and truly infiltrated politics and it’s not great for democracy. Before I get accused of being a killjoy, let’s cut to Zelenskiy’s own thoughts on the matter, shall we? As far as I can tell, he hasn’t officially commented on his new status as a heart-throb (he’s been kind of busy), but he has made his thoughts on worshipping politicians clear. During his inaugural address in 2019, Zelenskiy told lawmakers: “I do not want my picture in your offices: the president is not an icon, an idol or a portrait. Hang your kids’ photos instead, and look at them each time you are making a decision.” Advice a lot of people could do with reflecting on.

3/8/2022,"Detectives investigating the death of a Norwegian student they suspect was murdered by the son of a Yemeni billionaire in London in 2008 have made an apparent breakthrough, as they announced an arrest on Tuesday. Scotland Yard said a woman in her 60s had been taken into custody on suspicion of assisting an offender. Officers are still working to bring to justice the killer of Martine Vik Magnussen, 23, who had been raped. She disappeared after a night out with friends, having left with Farouk Abdulhak. Her body was found two days later among rubble in the basement of the building in which Abdulhak lived on Great Portland Street, Westminster. He left the country within hours. On Tuesday, Det Ch Insp Jim Eastwood said: “Martine’s family has never given up their fight for justice and, in the 14 years since her death, they have campaigned tirelessly to keep her in the public consciousness. “Martine’s family has been informed of this latest development. Though it represents a positive step, there is still much more work for us to do. Most importantly, Farouk Abdulhak should be aware that this matter has not, and will not, go away. “My team and I will continue to seek justice and use all opportunities available to pursue him and bring him back to the UK. His status as a wanted man will remain and we will not cease in our efforts to get justice for Martine’s family. I’m appealing to Farouk Abdulhak directly: come back to the UK. Come back to face justice. “Since Martine’s death, her family has shown true determination, together with my investigation team, as we want to provide some closure for Martine’s family.” Magnussen was out with other students from the Regent’s Business School celebrating finishing their end-of-term exams at the Maddox nightclub in Mayfair on the night she died. She is said to have left the nightclub with Abdulhak at about 2am, before her body was discovered days later. A postmortem gave her cause of death as compression to the neck and, in November 2010, an inquest recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. Her father described her as a “light, jolly, enjoyable person”, adding: “In any social setting, she could lift any sort of atmosphere. She was pure sunshine.” Speaking in February 2010 – two years on from his daughter’s death – Odd Petter Magnussen told the Observer he believed Abdulhak was being sheltered from justice by his powerful family and profiting from the absence of an extradition treaty with Britain. “This is the oldest and most serious crime known to man: the raping and killing of a woman – in any culture, in any religion, in any nation of the world,” he said. He had expressed hope that political pressure could force Abdulhak back to the UK, telling reporters: “This question of justice is something that has to do with right and wrong. Irrespective of the political or religious environment in the world, justice has to prevail.” But, in the following 12 years, little progress was made.

3/8/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. Like a lot of people interested in video games, I have spent most of the past week rampaging across the Lands Between on a phantom horse, slaying trolls, exploring castles and being repeatedly stamped on by giant boss monsters. The critical consensus is that Elden Ring, a new open-world fantasy adventure from the makers of the Dark Souls series, might just be one of the greatest games ever made. It is extraordinarily beautiful to look at, it’s incredibly challenging and it encourages players to discover its secrets however they see fit. It is also horrible to interact with. Sometimes really horrible. I’m not talking about the combat or the movement mechanics – that’s all fine. It’s tough but it’s fine. I’m talking about the interface: the menu systems, the button-mapping, the on-screen information display (or HUD), which all give players access to different facets of the game. They’re horribly designed. You need two different buttons to open and close the map. There are two different inventories – the main equipment inventory and a pouch – and they’re on different screens. Sometimes you pick up an object and it just disappears into your inventory, which works exactly like that drawer in the kitchen where you keep all the useful stuff you can never find again. This isn’t how games are supposed to work. User interface design is a science that’s taken very seriously in the industry. At the Yorkshire Games festival last month, the user experience designer David Sheppard, once at Jaguar Land Rover but now at Ubisoft, gave a really interesting talk on how much thought goes into creating games that are seamlessly useful and understandable to the player. He talked about gestalt principles, semiotics, heuristic design – all the theories making games comprehensible and pleasurable to use that have guided design since the 1980s. Even if a game is meant to be hard, it shouldn’t be the menus and button layout that challenge the player – it should be what happens in the game world. So how does Elden Ring get away with it? Certainly industry insiders are baffled. One forlorn user experience designer argued on Twitter that the almost perfect scores for the game made a mockery of his entire career. But the thing with Elden Ring, as with all the Souls titles before it, is that the metagame – the stuff that goes on around the actual on-screen action – is as important as the game itself. This is an arcane, esoteric universe where players must work together on discord channels and message boards to figure out the best courses of action. Just as scientists had to decode the Rosetta Stone to read hieroglyphic script, just as the Bletchley Park boffins had to crack the enigma code to interpret Nazi communications, players see mastering the very interface and controls of this game as part of the challenge. FromSoftware, the maker of Elden Ring, has managed to build into its audience an almost masochistic mindset, and it has done this through the arcane play spaces it designs on screen. It has taught players that they will usually lose and that everything will be hard, and in this way, simply being able to navigate the menus becomes a badge of honour. In a world where big games seem obsessed with over-explaining every facet of the lore, experience and through line of each game, where players are endlessly spoon-fed by quest logs and helpful quest-givers, it is almost refreshing to be treated badly. Of course, it only works if the game in question is an idiosyncratic masterpiece. And in many, many ways it’s a beautiful thing that game developers now take intuitiveness and accessibility so seriously. There is a tinge of cruelty in Elden Ring that is kind of avant-garde. Like the music of Laurie Anderson or Frank Zappa, or the art of Man Ray or Carl Andre, you have to fight just to understand what’s going on. I’ve put 100 hours into Elden Ring and I still get mad that you need a different button to close the map than you need to open it – it’s just so bad. The thing is, I’ll be moaning about it after 500 hours and 1,000 hours, but I’ll still be playing. Because it is wonderful. What does that tell us about art and rules? Nothing easy, that’s for sure. If you want to experience a hard game with a really good user interface, I’m going to recommend Dead Space, the sci-fi horror spectacular from Electronic Arts. Set aboard an interplanetary mining ship that’s been invaded by killer aliens, it’s a tense and often terrifying action adventure that makes innovative use of a “diegetic” interface. In other words, all the health and ammo info, as well as other options, are displayed within the game itself, so they appear part of the world rather than abstract menus. It’s an incredibly immersive system that inspired a lot of other developers, especially in the VR space. You can either play the original 2008 game on Steam or hold off for the remake, which is set to arrive later this year. The video-game industry is continuing to react to the war in Ukraine with its own sanctions against Russia. Electronic Arts is ceasing game sales and virtual currency bundles in Russia and Belarus, while Nintendo has put its eShop into maintenance mode in the territories. Epic Games is keeping Fortnite running in Russia but has ceased all e-commerce transactions around the game. It’s a swift set of measures from an industry that has often shied away from politics. For something completely different, Christian Donlan at Eurogamer has written a fascinating piece on locks and lock-picking, common elements of action adventures. But how do all those safe-breaking mini-games compare to the real thing? This week in the metaverse: Fortnite creator Epic Games has bought music-sharing site Bandcamp. But why? Here’s a clear-sighted piece of analysis from Brendan Sinclair at Gamesindustry.biz about the deal and what it means. ‘I just wanted to play Duck Hunt with my kids’: the man on a mission to bring back the light gun Gran Turismo 7 review – the ultimate racing game is fresh and comfortingly familiar Can a video game be as good for my marriage as family therapy? Not this one I tweeted out for questions in the hour before the newsletter was due to be filed (sorry Keza, you knew what to expect when you handed this to me) and thankfully got some really interesting responses. I’m going to answer this one from Guy Bailey: “Does it matter if you never complete your favourite video game? #Fallout4 in my case.” A resounding no from me! Video games should never become a chore. They are not something you have to finish in order to get everything you need from them. With an open-world game such as Fallout 4, the experience is more akin to highly applied tourism – you are visiting a landscape, enjoying sights, sounds and experiences that draw you in. If all you want to do is play with systems, if you want to bicycle the whole of Los Santos in GTA V or become a blacksmith in the Elder Scrolls, that’s just as valid as completing the main quests. Game-designer Sid Meier once famously defined a game as a series of interesting decisions – if this is the case, how you make those decisions is up to you. There is enough in our lives that demands completion – video games can ask for it, but you can refuse and simply make the decisions you’re interested in. Your time is precious – game-designers are happy for any of it that you share with them.

3/8/2022,"John Finch, who has died aged 97, was a Coronation Street scriptwriter who helped to shape the television soap during its first decade before going on to create and write two hugely popular dramas also set in his native north of England. A Family at War, regarded as one of the first “television novels”, followed the trials and tribulations of the lower-middle-class Ashtons of Liverpool as they faced conflicts of both a human kind and international proportions. Colin Douglas starred as Edwin, the patriarch, with Shelagh Fraser as his wife, Jean. The family weathered the second world war on the home and foreign fronts and the series, according to Finch, was about “a family involved in a war rather than a war in which a family is involved”. He spent a year researching the fashions, food and hair styles of the time, as well as popular music and comedians’ catchphrases, to integrate those details authentically with air raids, ration books and other measures governing everyday survival. A Family at War ran for 52 episodes from 1970 to 1972 and frequently topped the ratings, with more than 20 million viewers in Britain and many more around the world. Switching from Liverpool to Yorkshire, Finch devised another television epic, Sam (1973-75), writing all 39 episodes. The semi-autobiographical drama, beginning in 1934, was set in fictional Skellerton, based on Featherstone, the West Riding town where he spent the final years of his childhood. Like Finch, 10-year-old Sam experiences being abandoned by his father, sent to a charity school, going to sea to avoid working down the local pit and later taking a job in an engineering firm. The story spans 40 years, from the harsh realities of the Depression, through growing postwar affluence, to 1973 and a new economic crisis, with Kevin Moreton playing Sam as a child, then Mark McManus as an adult, and demonstrates how people’s lives can be shaped by their past. It won the Broadcasting Press Guild’s award as best drama series in 1974. Finch wrote 140 episodes for Coronation Street over a 10-year period, beginning with a commission for a trial script that was screened three months after the serial’s December 1960 debut. He said he was inspired by the “lively” characters created by Tony Warren, from the sex siren Elsie Tanner and hairnetted harridan Ena Sharples to the snooty publican Annie Walker and curmudgeonly pensioner Albert Tatlock. He became the soap’s first freelance writer to be signed to a contract, followed by others such as Jack Rosenthal, Vince Powell and Harry Driver, and, when Ida Barlow, mother of Ken, was fatally hit by a bus later in 1961 – the second Street character to die – he scripted the funeral episode. Finch said he learned to combine Warren’s comedy with his own realism – a valuable tool for his later dramas – and he was eventually able to mould new characters such as Stan and Hilda Ogden. By the time he wrote the last of his Coronation Street episodes in 1970, he had also served as the serial’s script editor (1961-62) and producer (1968-69), and co-written a spin-off 1964 touring stage show, Firm Foundations. Born in Liverpool, John was the son of Bertha (nee Ellison), a nurse turned health visitor, and Herbert Finch, an accountant. The family moved around Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire until, when John was nine, his father left with another woman, so he and his mother moved in with her father, Amos, a retired miner, in Featherstone. When she could no longer afford to keep him, he was sent to a charity school in York, one of 12 schools he attended before starting his working life at 14 and going through various jobs. In 1941, aged 16, he joined the merchant navy as an electrician, serving during the second world war on a freighter, a petrol tanker – at the height of the battle of the Atlantic – a troopship and a rescue tug before being medically discharged in 1945 on contracting malaria. After the war, Finch was a trainee librarian at the miners’ welfare library in Featherstone, then – with ambitions to become a writer – spent seven years in London. For the first two, he worked by day as live-in secretary to the sculptor Jacob Epstein before renting a basement off Baker Street, where he did PR work, sold newspaper advertising space and contributed articles to magazines such as Picture Post. Regarding himself as uneducated, Finch later reflected: “At an age when others of my generation were emerging from university, after their wartime experiences, I was basically a blank sheet of paper waiting to be written on. In the end, it all fell apart and I went back north, married and got down to the essential task of earning a living.” Leyland Motors, in Lancashire, employed him to write press releases, then he worked for a Rochdale engineering company as publicity manager while continuing to write in the evenings. Evening Song was broadcast by BBC radio in 1957, but two plays that Finch submitted to Granada Television, the Manchester-based ITV company – Dark Pastures, about Yorkshire miners, and The Schoolroom – were both turned down, although another ITV company, Rediffusion, produced the first, screened in 1958. Nevertheless, Granada recognised Finch’s talent for dialogue and invited him to write for Coronation Street. He contributed episodes to many Granada series, including the Street sitcom spin-offs Pardon the Expression (1966) and Turn Out the Lights (1967), as well as City ’68 and an adaptation of Love on the Dole (1967), and wrote half a dozen plays for BBC television. He followed A Family at War and Sam with more creations of his own, including This Year Next Year (1977) and The Spoils of War (1980-81), before leaving Granada. His experience of living in a London basement led him to devise the ITV afternoon soap Rooms (1974-77), then he created the BBC series Flesh and Blood (1980-82) and, back at Granada, Capstick’s Law (1989). Finch’s 1979 novel, Cuddon Return, about a Yorkshire mining village in the 1930s, was republished as A Shaft of Light in 2015, with a collection of poetry, Before, During and After the War, following in 2017. His autobiography will be published this summer. In 1956, Finch married Cynthia Hickman, who died in 2017. He is survived by their two sons, Stephen and Peter.

3/8/2022,"The US Environmental Protection Agency is poised to allow the use of four of the most devastating chemicals to bees, butterflies and other insects to continue in America for the next 15 years, despite moves by the European Union to ban the use of toxins that have been blamed for widespread insect declines. The EPA is widely expected to confirm a proposed plan outlined last year that will extend the use of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and dinotefuran on US farmland for the next 15 years, even though the agency has noted “ecological risks of concern, particularly to pollinators and aquatic invertebrates”. These four insecticides are all types of neonicotinoids, a class of chemicals that is widely used on crops to treat them for pests but has been found to cause devastation among non-target insects, such as bees. The chemicals assault receptors in an insect’s nerve synapse, causing uncontrollable shaking, paralysis and death. Neonicotinoids are used across 150m acres of American cropland, an area roughly the size of Texas, and have contributed to the land becoming 48 times more toxic than it was a quarter of a century ago. The chemicals are water soluble and quickly leach out of plants into soils and streams, causing such harmful impacts to wildlife that Canada has restricted their use while the EU has banned the outdoor deployment of clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. But while states such as Connecticut and New Jersey have enacted some curbs on neonicotinoids, the US federal government is set to bend to pressure from farming groups and pesticide makers to perpetuate their use nationally. “We are already seeing crashes in insect numbers and we don’t have another 15 years to waste,” said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s frustrating to see the EPA go down this path. We really are at a crossroads – we can follow the science and the rest of the world or we can go out on our own and appease the chemical industry.” An EPA spokeswoman said that review decisions for the neonicotinoids will be issued in “late 2022” and that mitigation rules for their use are being considered. “We understand the importance of pollinators for healthy ecosystems and a sustainable food supply,” she said, adding that the EPA “is working aggressively to protect pollinators, including bees”. An outright ban, similar to the EU, appears unlikely for the US, however. “While the agency reviews the regulatory efforts of the EU, EPA also looks at regulation in countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and others that share our risk-based approach to regulation,” said the spokeswoman. “The differences in the details of our underlying laws can naturally lead to different regulatory conclusions.” The use of neonicotinoids, hailed by industry as a key to bumper crop yields, has exploded since the 1990s. The chemicals are sprayed directly on to fruit and vegetables but are most commonly found embedded in the coating of corn and soybean seeds sold by companies such as Bayer and Syngenta to farmers. Only a small fraction of the insecticide stays within the growing plant, however, instead seeping into pollen, water and soils where insects are exposed to it. Researchers have found that the cognitive functions of bees are scrambled by the chemicals, making them unable to find their way to their hives, while affected beetles stagger around as if drunk. Neonicotinoids also harm birds, studies have shown, while their benefits are questionable, with crop yields in many cases not improved by the indiscriminate use of the chemicals. “These insecticides are not helping the productivity of crops on fields – it seems an amazing effort to blanket all these acres with something that doesn’t have a return on investment,” said John Tooker, an entomologist at Penn State University. “These seeds are marketed so well to farmers that they become scared they will have a catastrophic outbreak of pests if they don’t use them, even though this is unlikely. It has contributed to this toxic landscape across the country.” The application of pesticides, along with habitat loss and climate change, has been cited as the main causes of spectacular insect declines recorded in the US as well as several European countries. Worldwide, it is estimated that insect populations are dropping by as much as 2% a year, with the United Nations warning that half a million species could be wiped out this century. Tooker said that neonicotinoids, if used judiciously, can be useful but that their ubiquity has contributed to insects’ woes. “It’s difficult to dismiss the increasing toxicity in the landscape and think it’s doing nothing to insect populations,” he said. “These are the most powerful insecticides ever produced. We are just making insects’ lives harder in every possible way.” Environmental groups, meanwhile, have launched a legal effort to force the EPA to regulate neonicotinoid-coated seeds and have urged the agency to reduce the number of “emergency” permits issued to states that request the spraying of the chemicals beyond what is normally allowed without a full review process. The EPA is considering allowing farmers in Florida to spray clothianidin on 125,000 acres of citrus crops, including oranges, grapefruits and lemon, which would be the ninth consecutive year such an emergency request has been granted. “It defies all logic to say an emergency has been going on for nine years, the process has been clearly abused,” Donley said. “The science is so conclusive that these chemicals are harmful to the environment that this emergency exemption process is being used as a backdoor approval that goes on forever. “We need an administration that is willing to think about reform and challenge the status quo and we haven’t seen that with the Biden administration. It is certainly better than Trump but there is a lot of disappointment at the lost opportunity for change.”",News/Environment,Fears for bees as US set to extend use of toxic pesticides that paralyse insects,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/08/us-epa-toxic-pesticides-paralyse-bees-insects
