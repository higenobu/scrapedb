2/18/2022,"The University of California, Berkeley may have to slash its new admissions by about one-third after a neighborhood group in the hilly Bay Area city challenged the environmental impact of the top college’s expansion plan.  The university is asking California’s supreme court to intervene after the local group, called Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods, successfully argued the university was violating a major environmental law by failing to account for increases in the trash, traffic and noise that increased enrollment and new construction would bring. As a result, the university will have to send out 5,100 fewer admission letters than planned next month, and forgo $57m in tuition fees over the 2022-23 academic year. The case sits at the intersection of several big debates roiling California at the moment: how to reduce educational inequities and rein in increasingly unaffordable tuition fees? How to address a housing crisis even as nimby homeowners seek to stifle new development? At the center of the UC Berkeley case is the state’s environmental law – the California Environmental Quality Act – which critics say is being brazenly used by neighborhood groups to block necessary housing and infrastructure using the pretense of environmentalism. It has also raised the alarm that amid unprecedented demand for higher education in California, thousands of students will miss their chance at a degree from one of the top US universities. The construction project near campus that triggered Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods’ challenge would replace an existing parking structure with accommodation for 30 graduate students, and classroom space for the university’s public policy program. In its environmental impact study for the new construction, the university argued increased enrollment previous years had “no significant environmental impacts”. UC Berkeley has also said that it should be able to address the concerns raised in the lawsuit without having to limit enrollment in the meantime. But in August, a county judge disagreed. “Further increases in student enrollment above the current enrollment level at UC Berkeley could result in an adverse change or alteration of the physical environment,” superior court judge Brad Seligman wrote, ordering the school to freeze enrollment at the same level as 2020-21. The court’s assessment essentially concluded that crowded classrooms full of college students posed an environmental threat akin to a highly-polluting highway project, said Jennifer Hernandez, an attorney who often defends developers from CEQA litigation. Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods has stated that the university, which has increased its enrollment from 31,800 in 2005 to 43,100 last year, has failed to provide adequate housing for students. The group argues students have pushed into the city and impacted housing prices and homelessness in surrounding communities. It has further suggested that the university adjust admissions to let in fewer students from other states and other countries – who pay higher tuition fees than California residents – to admit more locals. “UC Berkeley students themselves have repeatedly said that UC should stop increasing enrollment until it can provide housing for its students,” said Phil Bokovoy, president of Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods. “We are all very concerned that UC Berkeley will create a housing crisis next fall.” But critics of the group have countered that while the university should do more to house students – many of whom struggle to find apartments and afford rents in one of the most expensive California regions – Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods shouldn’t be blocking the development of new housing in making that point. Bokovoy, who is a graduate of UC Berkeley himself, has suggested that the university expand elsewhere in the Bay Area. The university has not yet detailed how it would decide which offers to rescind if the freeze were to go ahead. But it has said the losses in tuition revenue would reduce the university’s capacity to offer financial aid to low-income students and could limit class offerings. Because many graduate students have already received their admissions letters and because of the number of new admits the university would have to cut down, undergraduate students are expected to be most affected. Riya Master, a senior at UC Berkeley and the external affairs vice-president for Associated Students of the University of California, a student association, said she worried that lower-income, first-generation and minority students who might have had fewer extra-curricular activities listed on their applications due to the opportunities that were available to them would be disproportionately affected. Environmental law is “not being used with the intention of protecting the environment. It’s being used to limit access, it’s being used to keep the neighborhood the way an older, primarily white generation wants it to be”, Master said. In a letter to prospective students, Olufemi Ogundele, director of undergraduate admissions, wrote: “This is unsettling news, we know” and reassured students that the university is working to avoid a reduction in new admits. The freeze on admissions would come as the demand for seats in the University of California system continues to rise. Applications to the UC schools have soared, especially since the state university system phased out a requirement to submit standardized entrance exam scores. Applications to the schools were also up among Black and Latino Californians. The number of students who took semesters off due to Covid-19 seeking to return to campus this fall will further squeeze the university’s ability to admit new students, UC Berkeley said. “This is a disaster for the university, and this is a disaster for students,” said Ozan Jaquette, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of California, Los Angeles. “It’s the meanest thing I’ve ever heard.” For many students, a degree from a highly-regarded public institution is a “big massive engine of social mobility”, he noted, adding that there would not be a way that Berkeley could feasibly reduce admissions to the extent currently required without it affecting students from all backgrounds. “Trying to use CEQA as a population control statute is a real slippery slope,” said Hernandez, the attorney. The CEQA, a landmark law initially signed into law in 1970 by then-governor Ronald Regan, has recently been at the center of several high-profile court cases challenging developments. The state’s attorney general has intervened in some cases that use CEQA to challenge new construction in fire-prone wildlands. But the state’s strict environmental laws are also used to challenge in-fill construction in cities, including affordable housing. Over the past several years, CEQA has been used to delay or block the development of affordable apartments for disabled veterans in Los Angeles and a 500-unit building in housing-crunched San Francisco. Recently, the wealthy Bay Area town of Woodside tried to use the state’s endangered species law to block the construction of new duplexes. The law can be exploited by people who want, rather than protect California from the effects of climate change and pollution, to preserve “their own personal environment, as they experience it, outside their window when they want to take a quiet nap in the afternoon”, she said.",News/US news,Top California university may have to slash admissions after neighborhood group complains,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/california-ucb-student-housing-local-group-lawsuit
2/18/2022,"There were five minutes to go when Luuk De Jong was introduced at the Camp Nou and maybe it should have been more. Barcelona were drawing 1-1 with Napoli in their first game in this competition in 18 years, seeking the goal that would give them a deserved first-leg lead, and in a frantic finale the man who was greeted as a saviour, an unlikely hero, almost got it too. In the end, though, De Jong’s comic-book moment wasn’t enough, a spectacular overhead kick flashing past the post, and Barcelona ran out of time. Ferran Torres equalised on the hour after Piotr Zielinski gave Napoli a first-half lead, but the former Manchester City forward above all reflected on the ones that got away. At the end of a night in which Barcelona and Napoli were playing for a place in a competition that they aspire to avoid, he pulled his shirt over his face, apparently crying. The last opportunity, like many of those that had come before, fell to him but the ball sailed into the stands.  “He’s worried, he’s annoyed with himself, but we’re delighted with him. When Luis Suárez first came here it seemed he couldn’t score and he became one of the best in history,” Xavi said afterwards. “We had six or seven very, very clear chances, but the result is insufficient: it’s a pity.” Gerard Piqué said they could have scored four or five. Despite an impressive second half and 21 shots, they only scored one – and that was a penalty. “It annoys me to hear the Champions League anthem and not be part of it,” Xavi had said, but if this was an unusual day with an unusual anthem, his team taking the knee, which was unusual too, the opponents were familiar from the last 16 of the Champions League two years ago – and there were 73,500 in Camp Nou, 5,000 of those from Italy. That brought a sense that this did matter and a sound to match, a game worthy of that stage too. Xavi had called it an opportunity and Luciano Spalletti felt the same, no concessions made in his line-up and an intensity about Napoli early on: while Barcelona had most of the ball, the Italians were incisive, shown when Victor Osimhen was released up the left, dashing onto a beautifully bent ball but denied by Marc André ter Stegen. It was shown again when Napoli made Barcelona pay immediately for the first of Torres’s untaken opportunities. Played in by Pedri and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Torres was still lamenting a wayward shot when a lovely exchange between Zielinski and Eljif Elmas opened up Barcelona. Zielinski’s initial effort was saved but he smashed the rebound into the net. Torres then curled another effort wide and headed over, while Kalidou Koulibaly recovered astonishingly quickly to cut down Traoré before the break. After it, the volume rose and so did the velocity, Nico leading the charge. The equaliser was coming even if no one saw the moment the opportunity actually came. Traoré’s cross had brushed the hand of Juan Jesus, spotted only in the VAR room. Belatedly, Istvan Kovacs was called to the screen. This time, Ferran finished coolly. Barcelona were on top, Xavi increasing the pressure with a treble change that included Ousmane Dembélé who was whistled with every touch until there was a realisation that it might be better to support him. They needed him after all. Dembélé escaped but couldn’t find Aubameyang. Next, his shot was blocked. With no way through, De Jong was introduced to a huge roar, as productive in those last wild minutes as anyone else had been in 85. First, it was Dembélé, then Sergiño Dest and Pedri, who flicked it to Torres, only to see him sky it. A moment later, Dembélé’s pullback crossed the six-yard box without finding a finisher. Then De Jong’s sensational overhead kick flew just past the post. The chants of his name were suddenly silenced when Dries Mertens should have won it at the other end, shooting straight at Ter Stegen. Torres should have won it too, but another shot sailed into the stands leaving time for one last header from De Jong, a draw having to do on their first Thursday night for two decades.",Sport/Football,Ferran Torres spot-on for Barcelona to level up Napoli tie,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/barcelona-napoli-europa-league-match-report
2/18/2022,"A rare red weather warning for coastal parts of south Wales and south-west England has been issued by the Met Office before what could be the worst storm to hit the UK in 30 years. Storm Eunice is expected to arrive at 5am on Friday, bringing potentially dangerous weather for much of the UK.  People were being urged to consider staying at home and rail services were being cancelled on a day with winds of up to 90mph expected and, farther north, possible heavy snow and blizzards. Coastal areas of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and south Wales will bear the brunt of Eunice, with the red warning in place between 7am and midday. People can expect flying debris presenting “a danger to life”, forecasters said, as well as roofs blown off, power cuts, uprooted trees and major travel disruption. A major incident was declared in Cornwall, with residents advised not to travel unless absolutely necessary, and to stay away from exposed coastal areas, with Cornwall council warning winds could hit 100mph. Residents in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole were also urged to travel only if essential by the local council. Eunice was declared a major incident by authorities in Avon and Somerset due to the potential for severe disruption. Police said it was likely both Severn crossings would be closed. Flood warnings were issued by the Environment Agency for parts of the Severn and Wye estuaries. Residents were urged to check if they were in an at-risk area from a predicted tidal surge and “take action immediately” to implement emergency flood plans. All Welsh train services were suspended for Friday and Network Rail said disruption across the wider network was “inevitable”. A number of attractions, likely to have been busier because it is half-term for many schools, said they would not open on Friday. They included the London Eye, Legoland, Warwick Castle, Kew Gardens and Bristol Zoo. In London, the Royal Parks said Richmond, Bushy and Greenwich parks would be closed. “This decision is based on the strong winds, the age and vulnerability of trees in particular parks,” it said. Playgrounds in other parks would also be closed. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, also announced that shelters were being opened on Thursday evening for people who are sleeping rough, with other local authorities activating similar measures. Councils across the south-west have advised schools to give pupils the day off on Friday, while all schools in north Wales will be closed. In Europe storms are named as a joint enterprise between the UK’s Met Office, Ireland’s Met Éireann and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). The list is set in advance, runs in alphabetical order, and usually alternates between names associated with male and female gender. According to the Met Office, the decision for a storm to be named is “based on a combination of both the impact the weather may have, and the likelihood of those impacts occurring. A storm will be named when it has the potential to cause an amber or red weather warning.” The list of names is partially generated from suggestions sent in by the public - and the Met Office says it is happy for people to either email suggestions or submit them via social media. Bad luck if your name begins with a Q, U, X, Y or Z though - you’ll never get a storm named after you. This is because names beginning with those letters are never used either in Europe or by the US National Hurricane Center (NHC). Martin Belam Eunice is the result of a process called explosive cyclogenesis, or weather bomb, which forms a deep area of low pressure that results in storms. A red alert is the highest level, meaning a high impact is very likely. Amber warnings, the second highest alert level, for wind are in place across the whole of England from 5am to 9pm on Friday, while yellow weather warnings, the next level down, for wind and snow are in force for a large part of Scotland – where blizzards are predicted – and the whole of Northern Ireland. The Met Office warnings came hours after Storm Dudley battered Northern Ireland, northern England and southern Scotland. A spokesperson said Eunice could be “one of the most impactful” storms to hit central and southern parts of the UK for many years. Severe and significant flooding may also take place along the coastlines of the south and west of England as spring tides are expected on Friday morning. The government’s Cobra emergency committee, led by the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Ellis, met on Thursday “to discuss the response to Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice”. Boris Johnson, on a visit to RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, said the army was on standby should it be needed. The clean-up after Dudley continued throughout Thursday. Thousands of homes were left without power in the north-east of England, Cumbria, North Yorkshire and Lancashire as heavy rain and strong winds, gusting to more than 80mph in places, hit on Wednesday, uprooting trees and bringing down power lines. Rail safety checks were being carried out on Thursday morning: Network Rail said it was inspecting more than 1,400 miles of track. Most ScotRail services were back up and running after being wound down early on Wednesday. Cornwall council said the coming storm was likely to be as powerful as those that affected the south-west in 2014, which caused widespread flooding and badly damaged the rail line in Dawlish, Devon. The council said the whole of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly – but in particular the north Cornish coast – could expect winds of up to 100mph, structural damage, mobile homes being overturned, communications and power outages and fallen trees. The worst of the winds are expected to coincide with high spring tides along the Cornish coastline at about 6am, leading to possible flooding. People are urged to stay back from cliffs and seafronts owing to the danger of large waves. The areas expected to be worst-affected include St Ives harbour, Port Isaac and Polzeath.",News/UK news,Storm Eunice: red warning issued in UK as 90mph winds forecast,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/thousands-left-without-power-as-storm-dudley-wreak-havoc-across-uk
2/18/2022,"Good morning. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned the threat of a Russian invasion into Ukraine is imminent. Covid restrictions in New South Wales and Victoria begin easing from today, and marine scientists call for calm after a fatal shark attack in Sydney. Restrictions introduced to curb the spread of Omicron across Australia’s two most populous states will be eased over the next week as cases continue to drop in NSW and Victoria. The changes, similar across both states, will begin to take effect from Friday. However, the lifting of the indoor mask mandate remains another week away. In Victoria, from 6pm on Friday, density limits at hospitality and entertainment venues will be removed, dancefloors can reopen and QR code check-ins will no longer be required in retail settings, schools and many workplaces. In NSW, from 12.01am Friday, density limits will be scrapped, QR codes will remain only for nightclubs and music festivals with more than 1,000 attenders, and singing and dancing can resume at venues other than at festivals.  Joe Biden has said he believes Russia is on the brink of invading Ukraine, as he joined Nato allies in warning that shelling in the Donbas region may be an attempt to set up the pretext for an incursion. Claims of attacks by Russian-backed separatists at several locations in Ukraine’s eastern territory, including at a kindergarten and a school, were said to bear the hallmarks of an attempt to incite conflict. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has claimed the shelling of a nursery school in the Donbas region was a “false-flag operation” aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian government. Ukraine also accused Russia on Wednesday of being behind a cyber-attack that targeted two banks and its defence ministry, which the country’s deputy prime minister said was the largest of its type ever seen. The Kremlin denied it was behind the denial of service attacks – attempts to overwhelm a website by flooding it with millions of requests – but the disruption reignited wider concerns of ongoing cyber-conflict. Leading shark scientists have called for calm after the death of a male swimmer at a beach in Sydney’s east on Wednesday. Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a marine predator researcher at Macquarie University, said the incident at Little Beach had shaken the community because of its apparent randomness. “It’s not every day you hear of a shark incident like this,” she said. “That’s why there’s so many people talking about it, and the fact people have seen it first-hand means there’s a lot that plays on people’s minds.” Dr Leonardo Guida, shark scientist at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said shark bites were traumatic incidents which “while rare, [required] thoughtful, evidence based action”. One of Australia’s most respected former public servants, Dennis Richardson, has accused Liberal senator James Paterson of engaging in a “grubby” and “despicable” attempt to blacken his name over comments Paterson made in an interview on Sky News. Thousands of nursing and disability care students across Australia are being prevented from completing clinical placements required to graduate due to pandemic restrictions and the furloughing of senior staff who supervise them. A revolt by a majority of Narrabri shire councillors has bolstered a community push to reroute the inland rail through the region, shining light on the project’s links with Santos and the Morrison government’s “gas-led recovery”. Taxpayer-funded ads exaggerated the federal government’s role in infrastructure projects, while a plan to include former deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, had to be scrapped for breaching advice, an auditor general’s report has revealed. Australians wanting to catch up on ABC television shows will soon need to create a free account and log in to watch programs on its streaming platform iView. Teachers unions are calling on the NSW government to extend the supply of rapid antigen tests for staff and students, saying the program has helped to curb Covid-19 transmission in classrooms. Twitter’s new chief executive, Parag Agrawal, is reportedly taking a “few weeks” off for paternity leave after the birth of his second child, a move that drew cheers from other fathers as a positive step towards normalising men taking time off for childcare. Days before the so-called “Freedom Convoy” reached Ottawa, starting a weeks-long occupation of Canada’s capital and triggering a string of copy-cat blockades, the federal government was warned that violent extremist groups were deeply involved in the protest movement. The use of intrusive spyware by members of the European Union is expected to face new scrutiny following revelations that the mobile phones of two more Polish citizens with close links to an opposition senator were targeted by a client of NSO Group, according to security experts. France and its European partners are to begin a military withdrawal from Mali after more than nine years fighting a jihadist insurgency, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed on Thursday. As the Game of Thrones star Kit Harington swaps furs for modern dress to play Shakespeare’s Henry V, he reflects on what the play tells us about masculinity, and how it addresses the issues that drove his struggle with addiction. “I see it everywhere,” says Harington, who has given “toxic masculinity” a lot of thought over the years, even if he bristles at the phrase, not least because of the roles he has played. “I see confused men walking the streets. I see terrible role models. I see a lot of anger, and I think we need to start dealing with that anger – we as men, but we as a society as well.” Merilyn Saunders loved sport, music, dressing up and, most of all, her family. The Melbourne grandmother died alone after contracting Covid in her aged care facility in January. Her family believe she was more vulnerable to the disease because she was nursing a broken heart after the death of her daughter. A mother to three children and grandmother to six, it’s unlikely Saunders, 79, would have been in aged care if it weren’t for the shock death of her daughter, says her brother, Colin Hughes. In this latest Lives Lost to Covid, her family remember her. Mazar-i-Sherif was once the most secular and liberal of Afghan cities. But 20 years of corruption and misrule left it ripe for retaking by the Taliban. Will anything be different this time? For years there’s been a global discussion about falling trust in the media, governments and the democratic process. Australia has often been thought of as isolated from these problems but, as we head into the upcoming federal election, we are seeing increasing evidence a lack of trust is permeating society. Lucy Clark talks to Lenore Taylor and Gabrielle Chan about how we can repel these threats to Australia’s democracy.

2/18/2022,"Long before full time, debate was under way regarding where this sits in a table of one-off results for Scottish teams in European competition. Success for Rangers against Borussia Dortmund is at least a valid part of the discussion. The visiting contingent inside Signal Iduna Park not only – and quite rightly – partied but realised this was an extraordinary occasion that will be spoken about for years to come. Far from stealing victory, the Scottish champions were fully deserving of it; including by the two-goal margin. There may even be frustration for Giovanni van Bronckhorst that Rangers do not have more leeway before the second leg. Dortmund, earlier the Europa League favourites, are staring elimination square in the face. They were run ragged at times by Rangers’ display.  From Van Bronckhorst there was post-match stoicism. “This is a very good result against a big European team,” the Rangers manager said. “We know we are only at half way. We are not through to the next round.” Indeed, Dortmund have the talent to turn this tie on its head in Glasgow. Erling Haaland, who missed this embarrassing loss through injury, could be back by then. “I can’t say that yet,” said the Dortmund manager, Marco Rose. “He did a little training yesterday but there is still some time to go. He also hasn’t played for quite a while. I don’t know.” From Mats Hummels, the Dortmund centre-back, there was scathing assessment of what happened here. “We’re playing an awful lot of nonsensical football,” he said. “A lot of illogical football and making our opponents so strong.” It felt impossible to disagree. Rangers clearly harboured no sense of trepidation. Spotting glaring weakness in the Dortmund defence is one thing, capitalising on it in the manner Rangers did quite another. When Jude Bellingham curled a fine shot beyond Allan McGregor to reduce the Dortmund arrears to two goals, at 3-1, there was a lingering sense the German side may complete their comeback and restore a sense of natural order. Rangers were having none of that. Alfredo Morelos, who tormented the home defence all evening, strode forward to restore Rangers’ three-goal lead. The final goal of six in the game belonged to Dortmund’s Raphaël Guerreiro, which changes the complexion of the tie ever so slightly. Rangers, though, must have belief they can puncture Dortmund’s shaky back line when roared on by a capacity Ibrox crowd. An indication that this may be Rangers’ evening arrived within 10 minutes. Borna Barisic lacked conviction with a shot that was saved by Gregor Kobel. Ryan Kent, who enjoyed an outstanding evening, was the creator. Brief panic, but only that, followed for Van Bronckhorst. Dan-Axel Zagadou had a simple task to head Dortmund in front from a corner but fluffed his lines. Bellingham flashed a pass across McGregor’s six-yard line that found no takers. That was as good as the first half got for Rose’s team, who were jeered off at the interval. By that stage, a James Tavernier penalty and a Morelos tap-in had put Rangers on course for victory. Zagadou’s miserable evening continued when VAR correctly penalised him for handball. Tavernier did the rest from 12 yards. It was the Rangers captain’s corner, flicked on by Joe Aribo, that Morelos converted. The pick of Rangers’ goals belonged to John Lundstram. The midfielder bent a shot out of Kobel’s reach from 22 yards after Kent laid the ball back into his path. At 3-0, Rangers were in dreamland. Bellingham, one of precious few Dortmund players who emerged with credit, duly had his say. Undeterred, Morelos survived a VAR check before celebrating a fourth. Zagadou was again involved, having deflected the ball on its way into the net. Dortmund had now conceded nine goals in two home outings. It could have been 10, Aribo’s shot instead flying agonisingly wide. Dortmund claimed an element of salvation with a long-range Guerreiro effort. This gives them hope for the second leg. Based on this evidence, however, they cannot have much; the home support’s disgust towards their team was plain at full-time. “I am really proud of the performance,” Van Bronckhorst said. Rightly so. The Dutchman must wish the away goal rule was still in place.",Sport/Football,Rangers dismantle stunned Borussia Dortmund to make it night to remember,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/borussia-dortmund-rangers-europa-league-match-report
2/18/2022,"Amultimillionaire DJ and her husband were last year forced to hand £4m to the National Crime Agency (NCA) after admitting in a settlement that they had brought the money into the UK illegally through a $2.9bn (£2.1bn) money-laundering scheme nicknamed the “Azerbaijani laundromat”. Izzat Khanim Javadova, who performs in London and Ibiza as DJ Mikaela Jav, and her husband, Suleyman Javadov, entered the UK years earlier after investing at least £2m under the “golden visa” scheme that has attracted thousands of wealthy people from Russia and former Soviet states to settle in Britain. Most moved to London, nicknamed “Londongrad” in some circles.  Javadova, a cousin of the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev, and a daughter of a former Azerbaijani MP, was granted a “tier 1 investor visa” during a “blind faith period” between 2008 and 2015, when 97% of investors were subject to scant checks on the legitimacy of their wealth. More than 3,000 people were granted investor visas during this period, including 705 Russians. They include: ● Zamira Hajiyeva, whose husband was the former chair of Azerbaijan’s state bank, who was served with the UK’s first unexplained wealth order after being found to have spent £1m a year at Harrods. Law enforcers alleged the money came from her husband Jahangir, who was sentenced to 15 years in jail in Azerbaijan. ● Nirav Modi, an Indian billionaire awaiting extradition over an accusation of defrauding a state-owned bank of £1.5bn. ● Mukhtar Ablyazov, the son of a former energy minister in Kazakhstan, accused of embezzling $5bn (£4bn) from a state bank and lying to a court about the scale of his vast fortune, including a £17m mansion on The Bishops Avenue in London. After the 2018 Salisbury poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, a former Russian military officer and his daughter, the government launched a review into the investors awarded visas from 2008-2015. The review has yet to be published. Meanwhile, new investors continued to take advantage of the visa system. The latest Home Office data shows 798 investor visas were granted in the year to September 2021, of which 82 were award to Russians – the highest 12-month total since 2018. The scheme remained open, despite parliament’s joint intelligence and security committee saying in 2020 that it was “welcoming oligarchs with open arms”. “It offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London ‘laundromat’,” it said. “Russian influence in the UK is ‘the new normal’, and there are a lot of Russians with very close links to Putin who are well integrated into the UK business and social scene, and accepted because of their wealth. This level of integration – in ‘Londongrad’ in particular – means that any measures now being taken by the government are not preventative but rather constitute damage limitation.” Chris Bryant, a Labour MP who sits on the foreign affairs select committee, said the UK “remains the soft underbelly for dodgy Russian money” and the investor visa programme had been a “gold-plated invite to launder money in the UK”. The Home Office announced on Thursday that the scheme would end with immediate effect. Bryant said the UK had become addicted to “dodgy money”, and questioned why Priti Patel, the home secretary, had not ended the scheme sooner, saying she was on the foreign affairs committee when it recommended closing it. The scheme was launched by the Labour government after the 2008 global financial crisis to raise investment. A £2m investment allowed an application within five years, decreasing to three years with £5m, or to two years with £10m. Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex and a Labour member of the House of Lords, said: “The City is hooked on dirty money. Foreign money, often illicit, has inflated the housing market [while] Britons can’t get on the housing ladder.”",News/Business,‘London laundromat’: how golden visa scheme created UK haven for dirty money ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/london-laundromat-how-golden-visa-scheme-created-uk-haven-for-dirty-money
2/18/2022,"Britain believes that nearly half of Russian forces that have massed near Ukraine are now within 30 miles of the border, in contrast to statements from Moscow that its forces were being sent back to barracks. Reinforcements from 14 battalions were in the process of arriving, officials added, while highlighting a pontoon bridge that had been briefly set up in Belarus in the past few days as an example of unusual military activity.  There was evidence, a defence source said, “of Russian forces leaving the deployment sites for staging areas closer to the border”. A couple of hours later, the US president, Joe Biden, warned that an attack could take place “in the next several days”. Russia has repeatedly said it has no intention of invading Ukraine and on Tuesday announced a drawdown of troops from Crimea, accompanied by videos of tanks being loaded on to transport trains. But the UK – in conjunction with the US – stepped up its warnings on Thursday. The pontoon bridge, revealed in satellite imagery, was built five miles from Ukraine’s borders across the Pripyat river in the Chernobyl reactor exclusion zone as part of ongoing joint exercises in Belarus between Russia and its neighbour. Ukraine is crisscrossed with rivers, which has been highlighted as a possible hindrance to any potential Russian ground invasion unless they used pontoon bridges. Images from Wednesday, highlighted by the defence analyst group Jane’s, showed that the bridge had been taken down. But officials said of its construction: “This activity is highly unusual and inconsistent with any past exercise.” As part of the growing public relations efforts, the UK’s Ministry of Defence also released a short video saying that it had seen “no evidence that Russian forces are withdrawing from Ukrainian border regions”, with a map showing a possible invasion on multiple axes. The video warned: “Defence intelligence assesses that he [Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin] would be willing to sustain thousands of casualties to get what he wants.” However, analysts from the International Institute for Strategic Studies questioned this week whether Russia had the capacity to carry out such a wide-ranging invasion as the video suggested. John Chipman, the chief executive of the thinktank, said on Wednesday that should Russia decide to attack, “there’s probably enough combat mass now present to conduct a more limited ground operation, perhaps to seize Ukraine eastern regions”. A key moment could come on Friday. The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said he would meet Putin that day to decide whether Moscow’s forces would remain in Belarus after 20 February, when the joint exercises were due to conclude. Previously, both countries had said Russian forces would depart on that date. Over the past 24 hours, independent experts have become increasingly sceptical that Russian forces are moving significantly away from the border areas, although it can take time for open-source satellite imagery or other video to emerge. Thomas Bullock, a senior open-source analyst from Jane’s, said that it “looks like the equipment is actually being moved to positions closer to the border … there’s nothing to really indicate otherwise”. The videos released by Russia’s Ministry of Defence, Bullock said, were heavily edited and sometimes appeared to combine clips of tanks both arriving to and leaving the rail station, making it unclear whether the armour had really been withdrawn. “It’s a bit misleading really,” he added. “If you wanted a consistent narrative you’d just show the tanks driving to the train station. Instead, they show them going there, they come back, they’re going again. It seems a bit all over the place.” Footage published by the Russian government had shown elements of the 136th Motorised Rifle Brigade and 42nd Motorised Rifle Division of the 58th Army, both deployed to Crimea, boarding railcars that the Russian defence ministry indicated were bound for their permanent bases in mainland Russia. Western defence sources said they would be sceptical unless they saw evidence of forces, some of whom have deployed across Russia, returning to their bases with heavy equipment. After a smaller buildup last spring, thousands of troops remained near Ukraine, rather than going home. The Russian newspaper Izvestia, which has good sources in the defence ministry, also reported that the 3rd and 150th Motorized Rifle Divisions were returning to their garrisons as part of the drawdown. But, as analysts noted, their permanent bases are located in Valyuki, a base just over 9 miles from Ukraine, and in Rostov region just 25 miles from the border. “Best guess is we will see a deployment shell game,” wrote Michael Kofman, a research programme director in the Russia studies programme at the US research centre CNA. “Units redeploying around Ukraine without altering the overall picture. Some BTGs [battalion tactical groups] leaving Crimea, but even more still arriving elsewhere.” More powerful Russian units such as the 1st Guards Tank Army had been identified moving to positions as close as 19 miles from the border this week, Bullock said, “tearing up streets” in small villages as they drove to positions within striking distance of the border.",News/World news,Britain steps up Ukraine warnings despite assurance from Moscow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/russian-forces-closer-ukraine-border-uk-sources
2/18/2022,"Hikaru Nakamura defeated Levon Aronian 3-1 in the all-American Fide Grand Prix first leg final at Berlin on Thursday as the five-time US champion, who has become a Twitch stremer with more than a million followers, showed his speed skills by winning both 15-minute rapids after two classical games were drawn. Nakamura needed a wildcard from the Fide president to compete in Berlin, and that decision drew sharp criticism from Arkady Dvorkovich’s Russian compatriots, but his games were full of energy and ideas. The decisive final encounter was level until Aronian, needing a win to stay in the match, advanced his white king too far into the black camp where it was trapped by Nakamura’s rooks.  This was the first leg (of three) of the Grand Prix, which qualifies its top two finishers to the eight-player Candidates at Madrid in June, the event which will decide the 2023 challenger for Magnus Carlsen’s world crown. There has been tension between Aronian and Nakamura dating back to a touch-move incident at Moscow 2016, but the former Armenian, 39, and the 34-year-old, who has popularised chess to huge online audiences, are now both well placed. They will miss the Grand Prix second leg starting in Belgrade on 28 February before returning for the final leg in Berlin on 21 March. In contrast, the quintet of Russians who failed to get past the group stage all face elimination. The only US casualty who did not reach at least the semi-final in Berlin was Wesley So, and the former Filipino was knocked out by a compatriot. Leinier Domínguez found White’s winning move in the diagram with seconds to spare, avoiding a plausible but losing alternative, Can you do as well? Aronian, Domínguez, and Carlsen’s 2018 challenger, Fabiano Caruana, are all residents of St Louis, which has become a global chess centre with backing from the billionaire Rex Sinquefield. St Louis has a chess Hall of Fame, a chess club open nine hours a day, and the world’s largest chess piece, a 20ft high king. Sinquefield’s other ambition was to create a group of top grandmasters, through a mixture of home talent and transfers, capable of winning the biennial 150-nation Olympiad. That target has already been fulfilled, as the US won gold in 2016, were an unlucky second to China in 2018, and will again be favourites at the next Olympiad in Moscow in July. The Grand Prix action now moves to Belgrade, where the favourites are Anish Giri, the Netherlands world No 9, Shak Mamedyarov, Azerbaijan’s world No 7, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, France’s world No 11. The last two are both in the same Belgrade preliminary group, already styled the “Group of Death”. China’s world No 3, Ding Liren, withdrew from both Berlin and Belgrade and is thus out of contention. What has happened to him raises the question whether Chinese sports officials have quietly downgraded their achievement targets. International chess, as opposed to the Chinese version which is much more generally popular, has only been taken seriously by Beijing since the 1970s. Chinese teams have been regular winners of the women’s Olympiad, won gold at the open Olympiad in 2014, and then, at Batumi 2018, won both Olympiad titles, the first nation to achieve the double since the Soviet Union in 1986. Success at Batumi was generally expected to lead to a still stronger Chinese campaign to create a challenger for Carlsen’s individual global title. It seemed that this would be spearheaded by Ding, but the 29-year-old, who should be at the peak of his powers, has just missed a major opportunity There are suggestions that Ding left it too late to apply for a visa for Berlin, then decided he had little chance to do well in Belgrade and gain a place in the final leg via a withdrawal. In contrast, China’s No 2, Yu Yangyi, has played in the World Cup and the Grand Swiss, and is also in the field for Belgrade. The obvious solution for Ding is to establish a second home in Europe from where it would be much easier to commute to major tournaments, Aronian, when still an Armenian, had a base in Berlin, while both India’s Vishy Anand and Bulgaria’s Veselin Topalov operated from Spain in their peak years. A wider concern is that Beijing sports officials may have made a policy decision to downgrade their chess ambitions and to consider the 2018 double Olympiad gold as sufficient fulfilment, tacitly abandoning any further campaign to support Ding towards the individual world top. Perhaps they have concluded that Carlsen is too strong to dethrone. Carlsen himself will be back in action on Saturday in the Airthings Masters, the opening event of the online Meltwater Champions Tour. Games start at 5pm, and Carlsen’s four opponents that day in order will be Russia’s Vladislav Artemiev, the 17-year-old world rapid champion, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Russia’s rising star Andrey Esipenko, 19, and the defeated 2021 challenger, Ian Nepomniachtchi. 3803: 1...Qf2! threatens 2...Rxh3+! 3 Kxh3 Qh4 mate.

2/18/2022,"Simone Inzaghi tried to remain upbeat throughout his post-match press conference but, in keeping with Internazionale’s entire night against Liverpool at San Siro, a positive performance came with a sting at the end. Inter’s coach described their display as “probably our best game of the season” considering they were facing “one of the best teams in Europe” and stated several times that he was proud of the Italian champions’ tireless shift. Only the fine margins had gone against them, he continued, with Roberto Firmino’s glancing 75th-minute header the decisive detail. And then came the sting, or perhaps just the reality.  “We don’t have much hope now,” Inzaghi admitted. It has been drained by Liverpool’s ruthlessness, their set-piece prowess, the impact of Jürgen Klopp’s high-calibre substitutes and the commanding partnership of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté in the heart of the visitors’ defence. The growing understanding between the pair provided a platform for Liverpool’s late victory and Inter’s understandable lament. It seems a statistical error that, after an open and hugely entertaining game in which Ivan Perisic wreaked havoc down Liverpool’s right for a sustained spell after half-time, neither Alisson nor his Inter counterpart Samir Handanovic made a save between them. Liverpool scored with their two attempts on target, from 12 overall, while the hosts failed to find the target from nine attempts. The determined, organised and intelligent defending in front of Alisson had a greater influence on his clean sheet than any profligacy on Inter’s part. Wednesday was only the eighth time that Van Dijk and Konaté have started together since the latter’s £36m arrival from RB Leipzig last summer. Their partnership is at the fledgling stage and to lavish it with praise is not to undermine Joël Matip’s continued claims as the polished, often unsung foil to Van Dijk. Matip has much more to contribute than smacking his teammates’ heads while they celebrated Firmino’s goal at San Siro, and receiving a deathly stare back from Jordan Henderson for his troubles. But Konaté and Van Dijk complemented each other superbly in the last-16 first leg in Milan, dealing with the physical threat of Edin Dzeko, stifling Lautaro Martínez throughout and curbing Perisic’s probing crosses with countless interceptions. Van Dijk, having worked his way back to imperious form, gave the 22-year-old Konaté licence to defend impressively on the front foot in the safe knowledge his back was covered. They were dominant against Inter’s set pieces – in contrast to their opposite numbers in the decisive closing stage – and Dzeko’s pained expression when clean through on the stroke of half-time, only for Van Dijk to cruise past and roll the ball back to Alisson, encapsulated Inter’s torment in front of goal. That recurring dream of running nowhere fast was played out in real time by Dzeko. Klopp has adopted a careful integration policy with his summer signing, similar in some respects to Andy Robertson’s first season as a Liverpool player, but Konaté is pressing his claims for a more regular role with every start. Liverpool’s season is brimming with the expectation and hope that disappeared from Inter in Milan.",Sport/Football,Konaté growing into Liverpool role and partnership with Van Dijk | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/ibrahima-konate-liverpool-inter-virgil-van-dijk
2/18/2022,"Elon Musk has been criticised by the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum for comparing the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to Adolf Hitler. The chief executive of Tesla tweeted a meme that showed a photo of Hitler with the words “Stop comparing me to Justin Trudeau” above the image and “I had a budget” below. The tweet was later deleted.  Musk’s use of Hitler’s image “disrespects the memory of all victims and hurts many people”, said the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, which is on the site of the Nazi concentrate camp where 960,000 people were killed. Using the image of Adolf Hitler & therefore exploiting the tragedy of all people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured & murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany created by him is sad & disturbing. It disrespects the memory of all victims & hurts many people. “Using the image of Adolf Hitler & therefore exploiting the tragedy of all people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured & murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany created by him is sad & disturbing,” the museum tweeted in reply to Musk. The American Jewish Committee said the billionaire’s tweet was unacceptable and demanded he apologise. “Once again, Elon Musk has exercised extremely poor judgment by invoking Hitler to make a point on social media. He must stop this unacceptable behaviour,” it said. “Musk may believe posting a meme comparing Justin Trudeau to a genocidal dictator who exterminated millions is an appropriate way to criticise policies he disagrees with. It is not. It never is. Musk must apologise and find other ways to voice his displeasure.” Musk did not respond to the AJC or the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, but posted another tweet that suggested his Twitter followers read a book about the economic history of Nazi Germany for “an in-depth explanation”. The world’s wealthiest person, with a $236bn (£173bn) fortune, made the original post in response to reports that Canadian authorities had ordered banks to block cryptocurrency donations to anti-vaccine protesters. Musk has frequently spoken out in favour of the Canadian trucker protests against Covid-19 mandates. Last month he posted a photo of the long line of trucks and tweeted: “Canadian truckers rule”. In another post he said: “If Canadian government is suppressing peaceful protests, that’s where fascism lies.” The Tesla boss also accused the US financial regulator on Thursday of targeting him with a “harassment campaign”, which he said was designed to “chill” his criticism of the US government. In a court filing, his lawyers accused the Securities and Exchange Commission of “targeting Mr Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government; the SEC’s outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of first amendment rights”. The filing is part of Musk’s attempt to persuade the SEC to distribute $40m (£29m) in fines that he and Telsa paid to the regulator over misleading tweets in 2018. The SEC sued Musk after he tweeted he had “funding secured” to potentially take his electric car company private at $420 a share. In reality, a buyout was not close. Tesla and Musk settled by agreeing to each pay a $20m fine, and to let the carmaker’s lawyers vet his tweets that could affect its stock price. Musk’s lawyer said the SEC had committed to returning the $40m to Tesla shareholders, but had failed to yet do so.",News/Technology,Elon Musk criticised for likening Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler in tweet,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/17/elon-musk-criticised-for-comparing-justin-trudeau-to-adolf-hitler-tweet-auschwitz
2/18/2022,"He saw it as a relaxed chat for a local podcast about social issues in the place he has worked and lived in for more than three decades and so, by his own admission, was a little unguarded. But Sir Tim Smit, the co-founder of Cornwall’s Eden Project, has become embroiled in a furore in his adopted homeland after suggesting that the Cornish could be “a bit more fucking articulate” and were too fond of looking backwards to “good old days [that] never were the good old days”.  Smit’s words were pored over by politicians and academics on Thursday – as well as by residents and business people in St Austell, the town closest to Eden, with some fiercer critics claiming his words were racist, a charge he strongly refutes. “He’s put his foot in it, hasn’t he?” said Simon Carter, an art dealer in St Austell. “He’s a good businessman but I think he has some odd ideas. I don’t think it’s fair to say Cornish people look backwards. I actually think Cornwall’s very forward-thinking.” Mark Lawther, who runs a travel company in the town, agreed. “Cornwall is a unique place with unique people and a unique culture, which is very important for people, but it’s not remotely backward-looking.” Claire Harris, who runs an art shop, saw a “grain of truth” in some of what Smit said. “People do look at the past through rose-tinted glasses at times,” she said. “And people can give off negative vibes, which makes getting things done much harder.” Most Cornish people, she added, were “too busy making a living” to be articulate about Cornwall. Simon Knowle, a complementary therapy practitioner, said he had time for Smit and there was room in Cornwall for all sorts of views. “Tim’s a remarkable individual. And remarkable individuals can be contentious.” In the podcast hosted by the Cornish performer and artist Seamas Carey, Smit bemoaned the fact that people who spoke about Cornwall were sometimes criticised as “arrogant” if they were not Cornish themselves. Smit, who was born in the Netherlands and moved to Cornwall in 1987, said: “You feel like saying, well if you were a bit more fucking articulate you could speak up yourself.” He went on: “You’ve all got mums who made the best pasties in the world and it’s fantastic and it’s fabulous and you talk about the good old days and the good old days never were the good old days. They’ve been bad for about 70 years and they’ve been bad because of tossers like you and that’s what I would actually say to quite a lot of Cornish people. “I really would because you cannot define your life in terms of what you don’t like. You’ve got to actually define your life sometimes in terms of the sunny uplands you would like to aspire to.” On Thursday Smit told the Guardian that he took part in the podcast for a family friend and was “off-guard”, chatting as if he was in a pub. He admitted he “went off on one” but said: “The idea that I’m anti-Cornish is as far off the mark as it could possibly be.” Smit said he regretted using the word “tossers”. But he added: “I’m not racist. It was a type of Cornish approach I was talking about.” Andrew George, a Cornish Liberal Democrat councillor, called it an “astonishing rant”. He said: “The Cornish have always been the last refuge for this kind of ‘acceptable’ racism. He knows he can get away with it because there are enough who share his lazy caricature of Cornish people and the prejudice and antipathy which accompanies it.” Joanie Willett, the co-director of the Institute of Cornish Studies, said the cheerful, holiday image people had of Cornwall made it harder for residents’ real experiences to be seen and heard. “We are not inarticulate, it’s that our story is not being heard,” she said. “We do try to define ourselves in terms of our sunny uplands. But that voice gets drowned out.” There were some backers for Smit. Kim Conchie, the chief executive of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said he must have been feeling “grouchy” when he did the interview but added that people like Smit and Rick Stein had helped Cornwall get its “mojo” back. Bert Biscoe, a Cornish politician, historian and bard of the Cornish Gorseth, which exists to maintain the Celtic spirit of Cornwall, said Smit had over-stated Cornish people’s inclination to be negative. He sais he was glad the comments had led to debate, before adding: “But he could have been a little more polite.”",News/UK news,‘Lazy caricature’: St Austell reacts to Tim Smit’s rant about Cornish people,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/lazy-caricature-st-austell-reacts-to-tim-smits-rant-about-cornish-people
2/18/2022,"South Africa’s potential move to join the Six Nations could spark a bidding war to host the British & Irish Lions in 2033 with Argentina, Japan and the US among the possible candidates. The Lions are due to travel to Australia in 2025 but there is no agreement in place as to where they will subsequently play after their multi-tour deal came to an end after their drawn series in New Zealand in 2017. The All Blacks are still expected to host the Lions in 2029 but with South Africa exploring the option of joining the Six Nations after 2025, the 2033 tour destination is less certain.  Last summer’s maligned series against South Africa was arranged as a one-off with a new commercial partnership for that tour only and afterwards the Lions’ managing director, Ben Calveley, said that future deals would be done on a “tour-by-tour” basis. “There is no long-term commitment to anyone,” he said. “We do a tour-by-tour deal depending on the conditions that prevail on our end.” Calveley also stated that the Lions were not looking to deviate from the traditional model of rotating between the Springboks, Australia and New Zealand but South Africa joining the Six Nations would make them a far less attractive proposition. That, in turn, could pave the way for the Lions to break new ground. Both Argentina, in 2005, and Japan at Murrayfield last summer have played against the Lions before and given that the commercial benefits of staging a Lions tour are huge for the host nation, they would not be short of bidders. The US are the frontrunners to host the 2031 World Cup and hosting the Lions tour years later would be the ideal next step in their progression. The Lions have not employed a bidding process before but did not rule out doing so in the future after the 2021 tour. Meanwhile, proposals for South Africa to replace Italy in the Six Nations – as opposed to joining a seven-team competition – have been rejected by a well-placed source in Italy, where a plan for an expanded tournament with the Springboks joining the existing teams is considered a more likely outcome.",Sport/Sport,South Africa joining Six Nations would create bidding war for 2033 Lions,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/japan-and-the-us-could-bid-to-host-lions-in-2033-if-south-africa-join-six-nations
2/18/2022,"The UK competition watchdog is teaming up with its counterparts in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in a drive to detect and investigate collusion between suppliers or shipping groups to hike prices. The Competition and Markets Authority said it was linking up with its fellow agencies in other “five eyes” nations after receiving “multiple complaints” from businesses about supply chains, where, for example, fees for shipping have soared by up to 10 times compared with pre-pandemic levels in the past two years. The CMA said that despite the complaints it was yet to find evidence of potential breaches of the law.  A new working group made up of the US Department of Justice, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Canadian Competition Bureau and the New Zealand Commerce Commission is planning to “meet regularly to develop and share intelligence to detect and investigate suspected anti-competitive behaviour and collusion”. The agencies released a coordinated statement saying they were “putting firms on notice that those attempting to use supply chain disruptions as a cover for illegal anticompetitive conduct, including collusion, will face the full force of the law”. It is understood the remit is broad, covering sectors including retail, healthcare and agriculture. In the UK, businesses found to be colluding could be fined up to 10% of global turnover and directors could be disqualified or in some cases face criminal prosecution. Michael Grenfell, the executive director of enforcement at the CMA, urged anyone aware of anti-competitive behaviour to contact the watchdog’s cartels hotline. He said: “People and businesses across the world have been facing higher prices for goods and for transporting them. “While price rises can be legitimate, the CMA would be concerned if collusive anti-competitive practices are contributing to these rises or preventing prices from coming down. “The CMA is ready to use its legal powers where it finds evidence that the issues in the supply chain might be caused by potential breaches of competition law. “These are global issues that are best addressed together. With support and intelligence from partner agencies across the world, we can step in and take enforcement action if we find evidence of anti-competitive behaviour taking place.” Businesses have been warning for some time of the impact of the surging cost of moving goods, which is partly responsible for inflation in the cost of goods and a squeeze on household spending. MakeUK, which represents the manufacturing industry, and the British Chambers of Commerce, wrote last autumn to the CMA, asking it to look into the world’s biggest shipping companies and whether soaring costs could be justified. Their complaints came as the biggest global shipping firms were expected to make extraordinary profits in 2021. The CMA told industry groups it would monitor the situation, but informed them it was not able to address the price rises unilaterally, because shipping costs were “the product of multiple factors, often international in nature”.",News/Business,UK regulator joins five-nation effort against supply chain price hikes,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/uk-regulator-joins-five-nation-effort-against-supply-chain-price-hikes
2/18/2022,"Swiftly doing away with any extraneous guff, the title of Channing Tatum’s to-the-point co-directorial debut Dog doesn’t need a journey, a way home or even a purpose, it just needs a dog. So dog lovers eager for a dog movie primarily about a dog will be reassured by the knowledge that Dog does feature plenty of dog but they might be a little surprised about what else the film has to offer, an odd and atonal ramble across the US where the dog comes first and plotting comes a long way after.  It’s been four years since we’ve seen Tatum on screen, (he’s been heard in a couple of animated films since 2017) and Dog is a slickly calculated comeback vehicle, as calculated as they come. He gets to be macho but sensitive, shirtless but sometimes merely wet-shirted and, most importantly, he gets to frolic with a cute dog, a hard-to-resist Belgian shepherd called Lulu, partly inspired by his real pet Lulu who died three years ago. Tatum plays an army ranger suckered into transporting his late friend’s difficult dog to his funeral. Both man and mutt have been traumatised by their time serving overseas and the long drive ahead gives them both a chance to learn something from the other in between a series of increasingly bizarre run-ins. For while the general structure of Dog is as basic as its title, the tone is far harder to figure out, a warm-hearted family film striving for a hip edge, the question of who this is for being asked on a loop throughout. The scrapes the pair get into include a failed tantric threesome with two women in Portland, a kidnap on a weed farm involving a tranquilliser and an axe and a racist attack at a high-end hotel leading to time behind bars. The script, from co-director and long-time Tatum collaborator Reid Carolin and former soldier Brett Rodriguez, is both strange and sanitised, caught between appealing to younger kids and also to their much older brothers; what if dog movie but cool. Whatever the aim of this all might have been, it’s muddied with every new escalation. The aforementioned racist incident is a particular flub, with Tatum’s character feigning blindness to get a fancy room for him and his dog, who is then triggered by the sight of a Middle Eastern man and so attacks him. There’s a way this could have been handled with some delicacy and interrogation (what sort of racial profiling has infected the instincts of some army-trained dogs?) but it’s in the centre of an absurd comic set piece, and all it does is remind us that while the film takes ample time to focus on the crippling PTSD experienced by many US soldiers (one of the script’s finest and most sensitive qualities, mind), there’s no effort to remind us of the other side of that equation. It’s not handled with the horror it deserves or even that much embarrassment from Tatum’s character. It’s just another weird thing that happens in a movie full of weird things. While a reliably commanding Tatum works well with the dog (he’s clearly a devoted dog owner), the script leaps past too many of the pair’s key milestones together. We’re told, and shown, that Lulu is violent and impossible from the outset but there’s not quite enough legwork involved in showing us how he manages to tame her (a brief, batty episode involving Jane Adams establishing a psychic connection to her does not suffice) and it’s one of many lazy A to C pole vaults the film does to rush us toward the finale. It’s a collection of uneven episodes – a wordless Q’orianka Kilcher and a racist Bill Burr also briefly crop up – stitched together by copious shots of Tatum sitting on his car in a tight T-shirt next to a sunset. Dog wants to be that sturdy plane movie you find hard to surf past when you see it on cable in the ensuing years and while it looks and sounds the part (Thomas Newman score – check), there’s not the slick storytelling and big emotional beats to match. It might be a pet project for Tatum but it’s a rough ride for the rest of us.

2/18/2022,"In government, words come cheap, but it is deeds and actions that count. Judged by the threats that Boris Johnson and his ministers make against Russia over Ukraine, you might think that Britain is fully equipped to turn its warnings into deeds. Not so. When it comes to something British ministers really could control, however, like targeting the assets of Kremlin-backed oligarchs and staunching the flows of Russian-tainted money laundered through the City of London, the rhetoric runs into the sand. In this sphere, Mr Johnson’s government does the exact reverse of what is needed. It speaks loudly, but it carries a flimsy stick. Now, there is some prospect of action. The UK is reported to be ready to abolish its “golden visa” regime within weeks. But why so late? And how effective will this reform really be now? The fear is that it is too little, too late and too ineffectual, and that it will prove another underresourced performative stunt designed to create an impression, not achieve a material economic goal.  The investor visa scheme, launched in 1994, under which foreign nationals must show they have at least £2m ready to invest in the UK, has been one of the keys to opening up Britain as a safe haven for dirty money from Russia – and from elsewhere too (in 2021 more than twice as many golden visas were issued to Chinese nationals than to Russians). The scheme did not just bring in money. It became the seedbed for an industry of UK enablers – including lawyers, accountants, estate agents, security specialists and lobbyists – to help integrate Russian oligarchs and others into many levels of British life, including the Conservative party. Some of the golden visa scheme’s conditions were tightened in 2015 and 2019. There has been no lack of calls for stronger action, and repeated evidence that ministers do not see this as a priority. Yet economic crime is not just theft. It is also a national security issue. In 2018, the Commons foreign affairs committee warned that Britain was not serious about the subject. In 2020, the intelligence and security committee said that London “offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London ‘laundromat’”. Only last month, the Treasury minister Lord Agnew resigned in frustration because a much-delayed economic crime bill has been left out of the next Queen’s speech. That decision shows where the government’s priorities lie. In the tension between its prosperity agenda and security against Russia and other threats, it is the Treasury – and the Tory party treasurer – that too often gets the last word. In January, a US thinktank warned that any US-UK counter-kleptocracy drive would be hampered by the close ties between Russian money and elite UK institutions, including the Tory party. This week, the former Tory minister Lord Faulks told the Guardian that Britain had become a laughing stock as a result of “a deluded desire to protect the City of London”. The recent shift towards renewed deregulation in the internal balance of power in the Tory party suggests that this will not change soon. Yet it should. Action against the City’s role in money laundering is massively overdue. But the abolition of golden visas is a gesture, not a strategy. It is a scattergun approach affecting all foreign nationals of whatever background, when what is really needed is a ruthless and properly resourced targeting of assets and investors with links to hostile regimes like Russia. If Ukraine is invaded, the case for action will be even stronger. But the measures need to be effective and thorough to have any effect now.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on ending ‘golden visas’: too little and too late | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/17/the-guardian-view-on-ending-golden-visas-too-little-and-too-late
2/18/2022,"Libraries are romantic yet prosaic places. The romance is that of reading, and the wealth of human imagining and learning that is contained in them. Access to the knowledge and literary art (poetry, fiction, drama) in a library is precious, priceless – and particularly valuable to young minds and people of any age with an interest in education. “The library was the place I went to find out what there was to know. It was absolutely essential,” said the novelist Zadie Smith of her own early life. The prosaic side of libraries is more physical. This is the world of buildings, shelving, books as objects, library cards, fines, computers – and people with bodies that take up space as well as minds that can be opened. It would be hard to find anyone who actively disapproves of libraries, and the principles of self-improvement and pleasure that they stand for. But when it comes to practicalities, Britain’s libraries are on less solid ground. The sector has been cut massively in the past decade, with around 800 libraries across England, Scotland and Wales disappearing.  The first Covid lockdown prompted a new surge of interest in reading, as the idea took hold that people forced to stay at home would spend more time with their noses in books – both finding out more about viral pandemics and escaping from them. But the latest data regarding libraries is sobering reading for anyone who values them as bricks-and-mortar places to go, and as places to sit, use the internet, or seek advice from a librarian – as well as databases. The number of books borrowed in the year ending in March 2021 was 72.9m, down 56% on the previous year. Physical visits also collapsed, from 214.6m to 59.7m, with a glint of silver lining in the fact that website visits grew by 18% to 154.7m. Of course, this is the behaviour that one would expect during a pandemic. Many libraries were closed during this period, while people were discouraged from unnecessary mixing. Book sales climbed to their highest in a decade in 2021, with fiction especially buoyant, which suggests that some former users of libraries may have bought books instead. Private libraries at home, whether large collections or single, cluttered bookshelves, appear to be flourishing. But the hope must be that visits and loans at public libraries will soon return to their former level too. Like any other service, libraries need users. And while booksellers might in one sense be regarded as rivals, in fact the vast majority of those involved in the trade, from publishers to poets, are library lovers – as can be seen from the volumes they have inspired, from Susan Orlean’s The Library Book to Matt Haig’s The Midnight Library. This has something to do with the romantic notion of the reader as explorer, with every book (or at least a good number of them) a door to a new store of feeling or understanding. But it also embodies the recognition that if books are to form part of our mutual life, there must be space in the public realm for them. Books can be treasured possessions, but there is also something special about a copy that arrives in your hands having passed through those of others – and that will go on being passed between strangers who share your curiosity.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on libraries: bring back borrowers | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/17/the-guardian-view-on-libraries-bring-back-borrowers
2/18/2022,"I am pleased that this story has finally been picked up by the wider media (The innocent have paid a high price for the Post Office scandal. The guilty have not, 15 February). But what is not being made abundantly clear is that this is actually not a miscarriage of justice, it is far worse: the Post Office was absolutely aware that the Horizon system was flawed but still continued to (a) prosecute subpostmasters on a grand scale for the best part of 14 years, and (b) tell them that they were the only one. The Post Office also took substantial sums of money from the subpostmasters. This is theft and fraud. This is far more dishonest over a much longer period than anything done by Nick Leeson, as one example of many frauds. This was not victimless crime. The Post Office has used every legal device it can think up to avoid any responsibility, thus continuing to ruin the lives of the subpostmasters. It has said that it cannot afford to pay the compensation, so it falls to taxpayers. I am happy that at least some of the tax I pay will be for a good cause. No one has been – or, I suspect, will be – held responsible or accountable. This is a very sad indictment of Britain today. I cannot describe how angry I am about this.David R LewisSittingbourne, Kent   Marina Hyde discusses problems related to the raising of concerns about technological failures. Research shows that the two main reasons why people do not report alleged wrongdoing are fear of retaliation and that any wrongdoing identified will not be dealt with. UK whistleblowing legislation aims to “protect” workers, but only does so by providing remedies once detriment has been suffered. It does not compel employers to investigate concerns even when they are raised through their own procedures, or to rectify any wrongdoing. If we really want people to speak up in the public interest, it is imperative that we amend our law to comply with best practice in other countries.Prof David LewisHead of the whistleblowing research unit, Middlesex University  One aspect of the inquiry that appears to have been overlooked in the media coverage is what this says about our legal system and the extent to which it provides the opportunity for ordinary people to get a fair trial. Given that so many innocent people were found guilty, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that this is evidence of ingrained and systemic bias in the system.Dr Mark SeneschallGerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire  Thank you, Marina Hyde, for your coolly furious and perceptive column. It is beyond comprehension that officials in the Post Office and the government have been able to destroy the lives of hundreds of innocent people while suffering no penalties. Though I have no connection with the case, I cannot help being ashamed that this was allowed to happen.Ellie WeldTwickenham, London  I have the restorative justice solution. Those in the management hierarchy whom the inquiry finds culpable of what is being described as the worst injustice in living memory should be required, unpaid, to run a sub-post office for, say, a year using the legacy Horizon software.

There are over 370,000 listed buildings in the UK, listed not by worth but by age. Despite my repeated efforts to replace old and inefficient sash windows with almost identical but double-glazed ones, planners refuse to contemplate such works, recommending instead that thick curtains should suffice.

Your article had no reference to the potential problems that retrofitting insulation can have, not only on the building itself, but also, with external insulation, on the character of the neighbourhood. It is essential that we tackle the climate crisis, but the solution of external wall insulation should be treated with caution. There are many papers which advise that retrofitting wall insulation can add problems rather than solve them, particularly with resulting damp. Loft insulation, double glazing and draughtproofing are preferable.Phil EbbrellMold, Flintshire  I was pleased that you included low-carbon heating in the excellent graphic on how to insulate and decarbonise an interwar home accompanying your report.

The country’s cabinet undersecretary for sports, Valentina Vezzali, said: “If Djokovic wants to come and play in Rome he can do it,” adding that tennis is “an outdoor sport and the tighter green pass is not required”.  “Perhaps Djokovic will most likely not be allowed in a hotel or a restaurant, but if he wants to play he can play,” said Vezzali, a former Olympic fencer and a 16-time world champion in foil. The cabinet undersecretary added that she did not expect Covid-19 vaccine mandates would be in place by May, when the Masters 1000 tournament takes place in Rome. The news has sparked a row in Italy, with people describing the decision as “hypocritical” and “shameful”. “It sounds like the rules do not apply to everyone,” said a user on Twitter. “You need a Covid vaccine passport to work in Italy, but if you are Djokovic you don’t need one,” said another. On Tuesday, Djokovic told BBC he would rather miss out on grand slam tournaments than be vaccinated against Covid as he spoke in depth for the first time since being deported from Australia last month because of his vaccination status. Asked if he would miss the French Open over his vaccine stance, he replied: “That is the price that I’m willing to pay.” Asked if this was also his attitude towards Wimbledon, he said: “Yes.” The reigning champion will be unable to play at Roland Garros as things stand because of France’s recent adoption of Covid passports. However, it is believed he should be able to compete at Wimbledon in June. The Rome Masters are set to take place in Rome from 2-15 May.

2/18/2022,"Prince Andrew has been dealt another humiliating blow after the city of York said it planned to revoke his honorary freedom of the city after the settlement of a sexual abuse civil case in the US. The prince has held the honour since 1987 when it was awarded in a huge civic ceremony at York Minster that attracted crowds of more than 200,000 people.  The event was hugely significant as it marked the first ducal visit to York in 67 years, and came a year after his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, when they became the Duke and Duchess of York. While efforts have focused on revoking Andrew’s title of Duke of York, his honorary freedom of the city had almost been forgotten until a former council official tipped off the Guardian on Wednesday. The tipoff prompted York city council staff to search the archives and they confirmed on Thursday night that Andrew still has the honorary freedom of the city. Councillors said they would seek to revoke that title in a vote at the next full council meeting on 24 March. Darryl Smalley, a Liberal Democrat councillor and York’s executive member for culture, leisure and communities, said: “Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we are seeking to end Prince Andrew’s links with our great city, including removing his honorary freedom. “York’s unique connection to the crown and the monarch is an important part of our city’s legacy and history. However, as a council and city, we stand with victims of sexual abuse and are doing all we can to end violence against woman and girls locally. “As such, it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew retains his ambassadorial title that is intrinsically linked to our city. The allegations and his associations with convicted abusers are incredibly serious and we are determined to explore all options available to ensure that his links to our city are severed. “I hope councillors across all parties will support the motion to remove Prince Andrew’s honorary freedom of the city of York. Buckingham Palace and the government must then act to remove his Duke of York title. We will be reaching out to MPs to raise our concerns and discuss any possible ways of ending Prince Andrew’s connection to York.” According to reports at the time, Andrew and his then wife attended the ceremony at York Minster to chants of “We want Fergie”. Every family in the city was given the opportunity to apply for tickets, such was the significance of the event. The surprise out-of-court settlement, announced on Tuesday, means Prince Andrew makes no admission of guilt over the claims made by Virginia Giuffre, which he had repeatedly denied and only weeks ago vowed to fight in a US civil trial. The Queen last month stripped Andrew of his military affiliations and royal patronages in an attempt to distance the royal family from the allegations. Nevertheless, he has kept his Duke of York title. The Queen alone cannot remove titles of peerage. Any attempt to remove the title would have to be led by parliament, through a statute passed by the House of Commons and the Lords. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, has said she will try to change legislation in the coming weeks to remove the Duke of York’s title.",News/UK news,York seeks to revoke Prince Andrew’s honorary freedom of the city,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/york-seeks-to-revoke-prince-andrew-honorary-freedom-of-the-city
2/18/2022,"What is happening on the ground in east Ukraine? Tensions have increased after Russian-backed separatists opened fire across the line of control with Ukrainian forces, hitting a nursery school and injuring three people. The west says Moscow may be seeking a pretext to openly intervene in the fighting in defence of the separatist territories that it controls. Russia has amassed a force of nearly 150,000 soldiers in the border regions near Ukraine, and the US has warned that an invasion could be “imminent”.  What are the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics? The two territories are run by separatist governments widely seen as Russian proxy states inside Ukraine. Since 2014, they have been in conflict with Kyiv, which refers to them as “temporarily occupied territories”, similar to Crimea. They have received military and financial backing from Moscow since they declared their existence after the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. The two regions cover an area of about 6,500 sq miles and were primarily known before the war for their heavy industry and coal mining. Donetsk, the largest city, previously had an international airport and hosted matches during the Uefa Euro 2012 championship. The fighting has destroyed the airport and left the territories mostly cut off from the rest of Ukraine in a dire economic state. The borders with Russia remain open. What are their relationship to Moscow? Officially, Moscow sees the two states as part of Ukraine and has not recognised their independence, but it has dealings with the leaderships of the self-declared states. Unofficially, the two regions are seen as fully controlled by Moscow, with a leadership installed by the Kremlin, Russian subsidies propping up the economy, and Russia’s military providing protection and arms. Why haven’t they already been absorbed into Russia? Russia has flirted with the idea of recognising the independence of the two regions from Ukraine. But it has stopped short of that or annexing the territories for several reasons. Firstly, they provide Moscow with important leverage in its battle with Kyiv. Russia wants the territories reinserted into Ukraine, but with their leaders having a veto on major foreign policy decisions, such as entry into Nato. If Russia recognises their independence or annexes the territories, then that plan, along with the Minsk ceasefire deal signed in 2015, will collapse. Secondly, many Russians don’t feel a strong affinity for the region. While ordinary Russians view Crimea as an important part of their cultural history and the Russian Black Sea fleet is based there, there is little that ties ordinary Russians to east Ukraine. Nonetheless, Russia has given out hundreds of thousands of passports in the area and helped integrate its economy with Russia’s, making it more likely the frontlines will remain static in the future. Who are the people there? Leaked documents suggest there are just under 3 million people remaining in the territories, 38% of whom are pensioners. That’s less than half of the pre-war population. Anecdotal evidence has shown that many of the people who remain are those who strongly opposed the 2014 revolution that toppled the former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych (his hometown is in the separatist-controlled regions) and those who are too poor or were unable to leave when fighting broke out. Public opposition in the territories is virtually non-existent. It has become extremely difficult for independent journalists to go to the region, first because of restrictions by the local authorities, and second because of the difficulty of reaching the territories via Ukraine. Earlier this year, a Ukrainian journalist returning to Donetsk for the first time since July 2014 wrote: “Now I feel like a tourist here, the heroine of a fantastic story that flew in a time machine into the past, and when I returned, I found that everything had changed beyond recognition.” How many troops are there? It is not clear how large a force is present in the two territories. Ukraine has claimed that there are “35,000 military personnel and 481 battle tanks, 914 armoured combat vehicles, 720 artillery systems, 202 multiple launch rocket systems on the uncontrolled territories of Donbass”. According to Rochan Consulting, however, those numbers could be “overestimated”.",News/World news,What is the background to the separatist attack in east Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/what-is-the-background-to-the-separatists-attack-in-east-ukraine
2/18/2022,"Traditional TV cooking shows aren’t really about cooking. They’re about watching, about seeing high-production cheffiness or Gordon Ramsay swear at people. Despite the numerous what-to-watch-in-2022 lists that featured Netflix’s Chinese cooking series Flavorful Origins or Nadiya’s Time to Eat on the BBC, it is rare that you will actually feed yourself off the back of one of them. The same is not true of someone strapping a GoPro to their forehead so they can show you how to make amazing scrambled eggs. Modernist cooking wunderkinds like Kenji Lopez-Alt are using YouTube to make videos that are as immediately instructive as they are zanily entertaining. For all the talk of so-called FoodTok luminaries raking in followers by the millions and earning six-figure incomes, it is YouTube food chefs who are making the best food videos around. They are not constrained, as TikTokers are, by the platform’s time duration or (like television chefs) dictated to by viewing schedules. They can take their time; they can shoot when they want to. No one is telling them what to cook, or what to say. No wonder there are upwards of 1 million food channels. Meet five of the best.  Launched in the summer of 2017, this channel serves as a diary of London cookbook author Rachel Ama’s vegan journey and every dish Ama talks you through is one you want to have a go at. Which is not surprising, given that she explains her reason for starting the channel as: “I went vegan overnight and it was such a good feeling, I wanted the people I loved to experience it, too.” Ama melds the Caribbean food her St Lucian grandmother used to make and the trad British dishes she grew up with in north London with restaurant fare from her travels in Spain, New Orleans and Colombia. She says she is always awkward in photographs, but on video, she has been magnetic from day one. In the second video she ever made, that boundless excitement surges when she realises, on screen, that the faux tuna she’s just demonstrated could actually become a faux tuna melt – the first she’ll have had since going vegan. “Let’s do it, lads,” she gasps and you’re right there with her and that packet of vegan cheese she’s holding up in pure, unscripted triumph. A particular highlight is the high-protein vegan Caribbean feast she posted a few years back, including jerk lentils slightly sweetened with maple syrup and a gorgeously creamy cashew-based mac’n’cheese. The food is so good that after plating up, she forgets herself and eats most of it before realising she has not filmed the tasting. As YouTube food channels go, Maangchi is up there with the most famous, a fixture in Top 10 lists. And yet, 14 years after she first made a dish on camera (ojingeo-bokkeum, stir-fried squid) host Emily Kim has no PR, PA or TV slot. She is still doing it all herself. Maangchi has become the go-to guide for authentic Korean recipes in English, from bibimbap (12m views) to trad kimchi (23.5m), and everything in between – fluffy red-bean buns, steamed eggs, twisted doughnuts, green beans in garlic. She is an excellent instructor, explaining what to buy, how to clean it, when to chop or stir or cover and how long to wait, in clear and simple terms. Kim shoots from her immaculately tidy but otherwise ordinary kitchen in Times Square, wearing fabulous outfits such as a green pillbox hat, a pink wig and fake grape earrings. An actual legion of fans from across the globe agree with her son that she is the best cook in the world and their own adoptive mother. Headlines and tweets variously describe her as YouTube’s Korean mom, the internet’s Korean mother and “Maangchi is my mother now”. The love is reciprocated: “My viewers keep sending me messages, saying ‘Maangchi, I made your chicken and it was a big hit and I was proud of myself,’ and I tell them, ‘I’m proud of you’ and even though I don’t see their face, I’m always thrilled, you know.” Fried rice, flavoured rice, things on rice, homemade dim sum, all the noodles: each new video here feels like an invitation and looks like lunch. Run by a Chinese woman, Stephanie Li and her American partner, Chris Thomas, based in Shenzhen, China, this channel does exactly as its name suggests. “English language sources seem to both overthink and underthink Chinese cuisine,” says Thomas: they try to mimic restaurant techniques, but fail to properly explain the foundational ingredients to a western audience. Li and Thomas’s videos are usually under 10 minutes long, neatly edited with a rapid-fire intro and cooking demo out on their balcony – if they take you inside, they will tell you why, and it is all part of what makes them so helpful. The viewer’s own culinary restrictions are always a priority: they will often give you options for the method (if you have a wok, a gas stove, or neither). They shoot up close with clear audio, to make sure you understand what tiger eggs sound like when they are being deep-fried, or exactly how slowly to turn your scrambled eggs to make them in true Cantonese style. For added homestyle goodness, the couple’s dog, Hayek, sits on a chair beside Li as she cooks on camera. “He’s an intense air-licker when he gets excited,” says Thomas. Chef and baker Jocelyn Delk Adams is a longtime blogger, cookbook author and regular on US TV with appearances on the Food Network and Good Morning America. She is known for very pretty, pastel hued bakes and her videos look and feel exactly like those treats. On screen, she favours gorgeous knits and ice-cream colours; she demos sour-cream poundcakes, buttery cornbread and perfect pie crusts with the easy, welcoming demeanour of an eminently capable host. From creamy grits with shrimp scampi to the deepest reddest crunchiest spiciest fried chicken – well, it’s just beautiful. “When I’m in front of the camera, there’s such a glow and a spark, an enjoyment,” she says. In one of her very first videos back in 2013, she goes back home to Winona, Mississippi to bake biscuits with her grandmother. You watch Delk Adams at the stovetop with Big Mama Maggie, as she was known to everyone, making biscuits as she did every day for decades. It’s an incredibly real, intimate moment – the kind that chefs like to write about in cookbooks, but that no one ever really gets to witness first-hand. “I think about my grandmother all of the time,” she tells me. “She is 100% why I created my entire brand, just wanting to honour her.” The four guys from Hertfordshire who started Sorted Food – Ben Ebbrell, Mike Huttlestone, Jamie Spafford and Barry Taylor – have been making each other laugh over lunch since they were in year 7 together. Back in 2010, on a drunken weekend away in Cornwall, they had the idea to shoot some food videos for some friends who were unable to make the trip. A short while later, they posted a follow-up on YouTube – a lasagne how-to which, much to their surprise, garnered, as Spafford puts it, “comments from people we didn’t know”. Some told them off for not adding milk to the ragu, others for not making the dish like their grandma would have. Every video created since has been a similarly communal effort: burger battles, chocolate challenges, blindfolded taste tests, the four of them often joined by guest chefs, and sometimes, celebs (Emma Thompson turned up in December with her daughter and a Christmas jumper). “It’s mates hanging out, being able to cook and eat great food with each other,” says Spafford. Only Ebbrell is a trained chef, so that means any given episode typically involves him rescuing the messes the three “normals” have made. They have toured the US for NBC’s Today show, published 14 cookbooks, launched an app, convened a community 2.52 million strong, and still they read every single comment. “It doesn’t make much sense commercially,” they agree, but being there for their fans, like they are for each other, is, really, what they are best at.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘When I’m in front of the camera, there’s such a spark’: The YouTube cooks leaving TV chefs behind",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/17/when-im-in-front-of-the-camera-theres-such-a-spark-the-youtube-cooks-leaving-tv-chefs-behind
2/18/2022,"As the 2022 Winter Olympics draws towards its conclusion, once again Norway sit pretty on top of the medal table. It is not just a one-off. Norway have been outside the top four in a Winter Olympics medal table once since 1992 and topped it in 2002 and 2018. But how does this small Scandinavian country continually out-power much bigger rivals? “I mean, we have a lot of cold,” said a joking Sturla Holm Lægreid of the (predictably enough) winning men’s biathlon relay team by way of an explanation. It is not simply climate, though. Sweden, Austria and Switzerland benefit from the same advantage and have larger populations and bigger talent pools to draw from. Geopolitics, budgets and population size dictate that China, the US and Russia always put up strong Olympic teams. What Norway does have is an intense focus on grassroots participation in winter sport from a young age.  Norwegian athletes will often joke they are a nation born with skis on, but cross-country skiing and biathlon are popular televised sports and there are more than 10,000 local sports clubs in Norway. In 2018, the proportion of children regularly taking part in winter sports was put at 93%. Importantly, at a young age the focus is on fun. They do not keep scores for games involving small children, but as they get older there is a huge active talent pool to move up to the Olympiatoppen for elite sport training. “We’re not many people, but we’re a people with passion,” said Mons Røisland after earning silver in the men’s snowboard big air. “There are so many athletes out of Norway and it’s so impressive and inspiring to see what everyone does to be here.” Norway’s success is not distributed evenly across all Winter Olympics sports. The country leads the all‑time medal table in cross-country skiing, ski jumping and the Nordic combined discipline and 12 of their 14 golds in Beijing have come in those three events plus biathlon. They have never won any medals in bobsleigh, luge or skeleton and have not won gold in figure skating since 1928. Team GB’s quest for medals started in earnest after a dismal performance in the Summer Olympic Games of 1996 in Atlanta when the team returned home with one gold. Since then, funding has been funnelled towards sports where there is a decent prospect of medals and national lottery money has poured in. That is an alien approach to Norway, whose overall Olympic budget is a tenth of that expended by Great Britain. In 2018, Morten Aasen, a former Norwegian Olympian, said: “We don’t do skeleton or bobsleigh because that costs too much money. We are a very rich country, but we believe in the socialist way of doing things. That success should be from working hard and being together.” The huge emphasis on camaraderie means the team have little room for ego. This was typified by Johannes Thingnes Bø. He has won three golds and a bronze in biathlon in these Games, with his elder brother sharing podiums with him as he claimed two golds, a silver and a bronze. Yet after a gruelling 10km sprint event at the Zhangjiakou National Biathlon Centre, which the younger Bø led from start to finish, he said: “Some days you just feel like the wax men do half of the work. Today was a day like that.” While it might look from afar that Norway are sweeping all before them, there are some rumbles of discontent about this year’s performance. The team have 29 medals, but it will be a stretch for them to reach the record they sent in Pyeongchang in 2018 of 39. In particular, the performance in cross-country has prompted much discussion back home. Johannes Høsflot Klæbo finished a distant 40th in the men’s 15km + 15km skiathlon despite going into it as a well-fancied favourite. He said: “In the Norwegian media, for sure, it’s been a lot of discussions about many different things. That is not the best or most positive thing for us.” Birk Ruud, a member of the freestyle ski team, thinks the answer is much more obvious. When asked about Norway’s exceptional performances in Beijing, he said: “We’re a country with a lot of good genes and we work hard.”",Sport/Sport,Not just snow: what’s the secret to Norway’s Winter Olympic success?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/secret-behind-norway-winter-olympic-success
2/18/2022,"The “golden visa” system that allows wealthy foreign investors a fast track to live in the UK has been axed amid concern about applicants acquiring their wealth illegally and the growing strain on diplomatic relations with Russia. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announced that the scheme would end with immediate effect to help to stop “corrupt elites who threaten our national security and push dirty money around our cities”.  Launched in 2008, the “tier 1 investor visa” programme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights, along with their family. The speed with which applicants were allowed to get indefinite leave to remain was hastened by how much money they planned to invest in the UK: £2m took five years, while £10m shortened the wait to just two. The scheme had been under review for some time, and its opponents were planning to push for the visas to be suspended through an amendment to the nationality and borders bill in the House of Lords, due to be debated later this month. According to the anti-corruption watchdog Spotlight, 6,312 golden visas – half the number of all those issued – had been reviewed for “possible national security risks”. Patel said she had “zero tolerance for abuse of our immigration system” and that the move was part of a “renewed crackdown on fraud and illicit finance”. Investors will instead be encouraged to apply for an “innovator” visa and must demonstrate “an investment strategy that can show genuine job creation and other tangible economic impacts” rather than passively holding UK-based investments. Pressure remains on Patel to publish a report into the golden visa system that reviewed those handed out between June 2008 and April 2015 to about 3,000 successful applicants, including 700 millionaire Russians. For the past seven months, the government has said it is finalising the report. On Thursday, the Home Office would only commit to publishing it “in due course”. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, a member of the foreign affairs select committee, said ministers were “playing catch up with their own Russia policy”. He noted that the committee produced a report four years ago – endorsed by Patel, given she was a backbench member of it – which said ministers were risking national security by “turning a blind eye” to Russian “dirty money” flowing through the City of London. Bryant told the Guardian that Patel had taken “no action since” and had instead been “doling out gold-plated invitation cards” to some people he feared had come to the UK to launder their money. He urged the Conservative party to reveal how many donors had been given the golden visa, and called for further action such as toughening up unexplained wealth orders, bringing in a register of beneficial owners of foreign companies, and pressing ahead with a long-promised economic crimes bill. Parliament’s intelligence and security committee also recommended in its Russia report published in July 2020 that there should be an “overhaul” of the golden visa programme to enable a “more robust approach to the approval process”. With Russia accused by the head of Nato as well as the UK and US governments of sending more troops to its border with Ukraine while pretending to be withdrawing, the move will also likely be seen as a diplomatic snub of Moscow. James Heappey, the UK’s armed forces minister, conceded: “As we enter into what could be a generation or longer of quite acute competition with Russia, all of the things that have become normal in Anglo-Russian relations over the last 30 years will be up for review.” The Liberal Democrats’ foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, said that “shutting the door to Putin’s cronies” was not enough as too many had already “walked through it with virtually no questions asked”. She added: “It makes a mockery of their promises to stand up to Putin’s aggression, when they are doing nothing to stop his cronies who are right now stashing their dirty money on our shores and claiming UK citizenship.”",News/UK news,UK axes ‘golden visa’ scheme after fraud and Russia concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/uk-ministers-plan-to-scrap-golden-visa-scheme-amid-russia-concerns
2/18/2022,"My grandfather Dennis Lee, who has died aged 91, was a proud Yorkshireman whose love of Shakespeare, opera, jazz and his favourite, Nina Simone, was passed on to his family and friends. He was also passionate about the benefits of education and never stopped learning throughout his life. Born in Sheffield to Ernest Lee, a miner and steelworker, and Edna (nee Poole), Dennis lived in the city his entire life and survived the blitz.  Dennis attended Chaucer secondary school, leaving at 15 to start on the factory floor at the Batchelor’s foods factory, in Wadsley Bridge. He rose through the ranks to become works manager. Aged 28, he was diagnosed with Brittle diabetes, which is one of the most difficult forms of the condition to manage, especially so in the early days of insulin research. He married Barbara Lindley in 1953 and they went on to have two children, Stuart and Denise. When, in 1958, Barbara’s mother died they took in Barbara’s 10-year-old sister, Christine. They were both loving grandparents and my sisters and I would spend many happy hours at their house. I was there almost every Friday night and my grandfather educated me in literature, opera, jazz and – as I got older – late night comedy on BBC Two. Dennis left Batchelor’s in 1987 and worked at Corus Steel as a manager until his retirement in 1995. An ardent Labour supporter, Dennis was not a materialistic man and jokes were made in the family about the creaking of his wallet when he finally opened it. But when there was real need he was generous to a fault, rescuing his brother from debt and putting money aside to help me with the costs of university. In retirement he was a keen fisherman and would take part in local competitions. He enjoyed the theatre and would take us to see opera, musicals, and plays by Pinter and Shakespeare. He loved watching snooker every year at the Crucible theatre. As he entered his 80s his diabetes caused more difficulties. Many doctors expressed surprise that he had lasted as long as he had and in 2019 he was awarded the Robert Lawrence medal for having lived with diabetes for 60 years. Barbara died in 1999. He is survived by his children, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",News/UK news,Dennis Lee obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/dennis-lee-obituary
2/18/2022,"Andrew Neil has launched libel proceedings against Jennifer Arcuri, the former lover of prime minister Boris Johnson, after she made allegations about the broadcaster’s inclusion in an address book owned by the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Legal filings show Neil has made good on his threat to sue Arcuri after she publicly claimed the journalist was on the “pedo elite train”. The former GB News presenter, who is now hosting a show for Channel 4, said Arcuri’s comments were “evil lies” and “vile and untrue accusations”.  Neil has repeatedly said he never met Epstein and the presence of his contact details in the “black book” is because he had previously met Ghislaine Maxwell in New York during the 1990s. Last year Maxwell was found guilty of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sexual encounters with Epstein. Arcuri came to prominence after claiming she had an affair with Johnson when he was mayor of London, prompting investigations into the decision to award her startup business tens of thousands of pounds in public money. She also accompanied the future prime minister on trade missions, although Johnson will not face a police investigation over the matter. Her exchanges with Neil began as a Twitter row about the effectiveness of vaccines before descending into mudslinging about his supposed connection to Epstein. Arcuri has now deleted some of the tweets that prompted Neil to issue his legal threats but this may be too late. Arcuri, who now lives in the US, is listed as a litigant in person on the high court filings, suggesting she does not currently have legal representative. British libel law places the onus on the person who made the disputed allegations to substantiate their claims. In a series of tweets about Epstein, Neil also told another Twitter user he had no connection to the deceased former financier: “I’ve never even met him, communicated with him, never mind visited any of his properties or been on his planes, cars, buses, helicopters, ponies,” he tweeted. “Now what is it you don’t understand about piss off. And apologise before you do, please, piss off.” He also wrote that he had decided to take legal action “not just to hold Arcuri, who I’ve never met and have no interest in, to account but, more important, to establish that the twitterati can’t just promulgate evil lies without consequences. If you think anonymity will protect you, you’re in for a big surprise.” In a tweet at the end of December, Neil told Arcuri: “My legal team has prepared a massive case against you and we’ll be seeking exemplary damages. Papers will be served in UK and US. I know you’ve been keeping your location private. But tell me, what’s it like in Panama City, Florida this time of year?” Arcuri responded: “This guy is going to give himself a heart attack.”",News/Media,Andrew Neil launches libel claim against Jennifer Arcuri after Epstein tweet,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/17/andrew-neil-launches-libel-claim-against-jennifer-arcuri-after-epstein-tweet
2/18/2022,"Days before the so-called Freedom Convoy reached Ottawa, starting a weeks-long occupation of Canada’s capital and triggering a string of copy-cat blockades, the federal government was warned that violent extremist groups were deeply involved in the protest movement. Intelligence assessments – prepared by Canada’s Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre (Itac) and seen by the Guardian – warned in late January that it was “likely” that extremists were involved and said that the scale of the protests could yet pose a “trigger point and opportunity for potential lone actor attackers to conduct a terrorism attack”.  The assessments offer the first real glimpse into how federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies have assessed the threat of Canada’s anti-vaccine and conspiracy theory movement. “We knew these people were coming,” said a federal government source, who indicated that the Security Intelligence Service Canada – Canada’s main intelligence service, of which Itac is a part – had flagged the involvement of extremist groups and individuals in official briefings. The intelligence reports also show that clear warnings were sent to Ottawa police ahead of the convoy’s arrival in the capital. The city’s police has become the focus of a fierce debate over whether they should have done more to prepare for, or prevent, the occupation. Itac reported that supporters of the convoy have “advocated civil war”, called for violence against prime minister Justin Trudeau, and said the protest should be “used as Canada’s ‘January 6’”, in a reference to the storming of the US Capitol. An early report, dated 27 January, Itac concluded that “a coordinated, complex terrorist attack or planned storming Parliament or other federal locations is unlikely”. But it concludes that the potential for violence remained very real. “While the organizers have declared that this is an act of peaceful protest, some ideologically motivated violent extremism followers in Canada have seized upon this rally to advocate for their own ideological objectives,” the January document reads. “Extremists and other individuals supporting Covid-19 conspiracy theories and violent anti-authority/anti-government views have expressed intent to participate in the convoy and to attend the accompanying protest in Ottawa.” The assessment warns that protesters, and possible extremists, “could use rudimentary capabilities, such as trucks, cargo and fuel, to cause disruptions to infrastructure”. Presciently, the report warned that the 31 January return of Parliament “could motivate a dedicated group of protesters to prolong their protest in Ottawa”. Included in the report is a meme, which was shared widely in the early days of the convoy, which shows a map with a circle surrounding Ottawa and reads “permanent gridlock zone until freedom restored”. As the occupation dragged into its second week, Itac issued another report on 8 February. “All events remained relatively peaceful, with limited low-level conflict,” it reads. “However, violent online rhetoric and the physical presence of ideological extremists at some gatherings remain a factor of concern.” The report makes particular mention of the QAnon figure Romana Didulo, the self-styled “Queen of Canada”, who has instructed her followers to kill healthcare workers and politicians. She and some of her followers appeared in Ottawa for the occupation, waving flags representing her supposed kingdom. Itac also drew attention to a constellation of other demonstrations across the country, including in Quebec City where “the QAnon flag was observed, and the extremist group La Meute stated that approximately 100 members participated in the protest.” La Meute, or The Pack is one of the most visible and influential far-right, anti-Islam organizations in Quebec. It also claimed to have sent supporters to the Ottawa protests, the report said. In the second report, Itac continued to assess the likelihood of a January 6-style insurrection as unlikely, but began warning that “the most likely ideologically motivated violent extremism-related scenario involves an individual or small group using readily available weapons and resources such as knives, firearms, homemade explosives and vehicles in public areas against soft targets, including opposition groups or members of the general public.” Earlier this week at a blockade at the Coutts border crossing in Alberta, police arrested four men and charged them with conspiring to kill police officers and civilians. On Wednesday, the public safety minister, Marco Medicino confirmed that some of those arrested had ties to some extremist elements in Ottawa. Some of the men arrested are believed to belong to a loose-knit group known as Diagolon. Itac reports are largely based on open source intelligence, meaning information already available in the public domain, and law enforcement sources – the centre does not actively monitor individuals or conduct its own investigations. The purpose of Itac is to provide various levels of local law enforcement with reliable information on emerging threats, said Stephanie Carvin, a former intelligence analyst with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service who now teaches at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa. “They seem to recognize the nature of the event, and who’s coming to the event,” she said. But, the analysts appear to have missed some of the extreme elements of the leadership of the convoy, Carvin said. “It was a movement led by extremists to begin with, and we should not be surprised they turned to extremist tactics.” Itac’s warning that only a dogmatic few would brave the Ottawa cold for parliament’s return on 31 January proved to be a significant underestimation. Yet, even that warning wasn’t heeded. The deputy chief of the Ottawa police service said in early February that they planned for “a potentially weekend-long demonstration”, and were caught off guard when the convoy parked in front of Parliament. “Was the problem that he didn’t have the information?” Carvin said. “Or was the problem that they just don’t take white supremacy seriously?” Carvin said intelligence agencies had been briefing the Canadian government as far back as late December on the possible threat posed by the convoy. “[The protest leaders] were exceptionally clear on what they wanted to do, and how they were going to go about doing it,” she said.",News/World news,Canada was warned before protests that violent extremists infiltrated convoy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/ottawa-protests-anti-terror-agency-warned-violent-extremists
2/18/2022,"There have been more than 1m excess deaths in the US during the pandemic, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The deaths are mainly attributable to Covid-19, as well as conditions that may have resulted from delayed medical care and overwhelmed health systems.  At least 923,000 Americans have died from confirmed Covid cases, according to the CDC. Other causes of death above the normally expected number have included heart disease, hypertension and Alzheimer’s disease. Some Americans also die months after their initial Covid diagnosis, because the virus created other fatal complications. Excess deaths are calculated by looking at previous years’ fatalities. In 2019, there were 2.8m deaths in the US; in 2020, it was approximately 3.3m. “All-cause excess mortality is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to look at the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School. “It does not rely on how many tests were done or on subjective cause of death designations.” While cause of death can sometimes be difficult to ascertain, and political pressures can lead to miscounting, excess deaths can indicate the broad scope of a health emergency. “Whenever we hear that another 100,000 people died of Covid, there’s a reliable chorus of naysayers who claim that these deaths would’ve happened anyway,” Faust said. “Excess deaths cuts through that, because it’s about reporting whether the total number of deaths is out of the ordinary.” These figures can reveal the truer toll of Covid – including deaths directly from infection as well as deaths from the circumstances of the crisis. The global number of excess deaths may be millions higher than the official count of Covid deaths. The toll of Covid has been geographically uneven in the US. At first the virus was largely confined to major cities, but then it began spreading in rural areas, with devastating effect. Deaths among working-age Americans are up 40% during the roughly two years of the pandemic, one insurance executive said in December. Many Americans delayed seeking care during the pandemic, and others may have seen the quality of their care decrease as health systems were overburdened by Covid. The US is also in the midst of an overdose crisis, with more than 100,000 overdose deaths in the first year of the pandemic. Excess deaths are also known as untimely or “early” deaths. While the majority of excess deaths in the US occurred among those 65 and older, many of those Americans had many years left to live. The average 80-year-old in the US has a life expectancy of eight more years, Faust noted. “If suddenly more 80-year-olds are dying than usual, it’s a simple fact that many of them had not just months but years, even a decade or more, of life left otherwise in some cases. “Sometimes people say that stopping Covid merely ‘delays death’. To that, I say, ‘Exactly. That’s what medicine and public health are all about.’”",News/World news,"US has suffered more than 1m excess deaths during pandemic, CDC finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/us-excess-deaths-pandemic-cdc
2/18/2022,"Henry Danton, who has died aged 102, was the last survivor of the six dancers who created Frederick Ashton’s ballet masterpiece Symphonic Variations in 1946. This was Ashton’s first creation for the stage of the Royal Opera House. He filled the work with a flow of movement, challenging his dancers’ stamina and drawing on their individual skills. Danton’s interest in ballet was aroused by seeing Léonide Massine’s Jardin Public performed by Wassily de Basil’s Ballet Russe at Covent Garden in the 1930s, and particularly by the idea of a statue coming to life, but he did not start training in ballet until he was 21.  He enjoyed ice-skating. A friend took him to a rink in Brighton, where he worked with a young partner whose mother introduced him to the ballet teacher Judith Espinosa. She was immediately impressed by Danton’s athletic body (a result of his earlier military training) and turnout (a result of skating) and in 18 months he raced through the Royal Academy of Dancing examinations with honours. In 1942 he was awarded the academy’s Adeline Genée silver award but, because of wartime metal shortages it was not until 2019, when he was 100, that he received the medal. During the second world war, male dancers were in short supply and Danton was snapped up for the short-lived Allied Ballet and then Mona Inglesby’s International Ballet. With both he danced the role created by Vaslav Nijinsky in Les Sylphides, as well as performing new works. With International he benefited from the teaching of the Polish ballet master Stanislas Idzikowski. While he valued his opportunities to dance principal roles, after six months he asked Ninette de Valois if he could join Britain’s premiere company, the Sadler’s Wells Ballet. He acquired a place in May 1944, remaining until 1947, and was a member when it took up residence at the Royal Opera House in 1946. Although he was technically weak in some steps Danton had a strong jump and was happy dancing choreography by Ashton and the Florestan pas de trois in The Sleeping Beauty. He did not get on with De Valois, however. He disliked her ballets – he danced the Rake’s Friend in De Valois’s The Rake’s Progress – and her emphasis on counts rather than the music. He was disappointed, too, by the company’s teachers. De Valois disapproved of his taking classes outside the company with the Russian teacher Vera Volkova, who drew from her dancers an elegant musicality, encouraging them to use their full body and soul, and with whom Danton had an affair. Danton danced with Sadler’s Wells Ballet on tour to Brussels and Paris in February-March 1945. In Paris he discovered another Russian teacher, Victor Gsovsky, who suited him. When he left Sadler’s Wells he returned to Paris. He toured France and western Europe, partnering an étoile of the Paris Opéra, Lycette Darsonval, and followed Gsovsky to the Ballets des Champs-Elysées, one of the most exciting postwar French companies, and then to the Metropolitan Ballet in London. He was born into a military family in Bedford. His father, Charles Boileau Down, a major with the Royal Garrison Artillery, died from war injuries in 1919 when Henry was three months old, leaving his mother, Beatrice (nee Forsyth), to raise three children. Henry and his brother were both educated via a King’s cadetship at Wellington college and the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. Henry had an agreement with his mother that he would accept his military schooling but, once his education was complete, he should be allowed to choose a career. He graduated and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, but this coincided with the Munich crisis, leaving him unable to leave the services and, indeed, promoted to captain at the outbreak of war. But the army was not for him; he had a breakdown and was released. He later altered his surname to Danton, as Down was not seen as a suitable name for dancer. Nevertheless, his military background accounted for his bearing and his demand for respect. Clearly, he was antagonised by De Valois constantly calling him “boy” and he had sufficient independence to develop his own career rather than toe any line. In the 50s his contacts in the dance world and curiosity took him to New York, South America and Australia. He significantly influenced newly formed ballet companies in Caracas, Venezuela, and Bogotá, Colombia, and embarked on a career as a teacher. Although he lived thereafter in the US, Danton made regular visits to the UK for birthday celebrations, to attend events and reunions, enjoying his status as a senior member of the Royal Ballet. He regarded life as an adventure and loved teaching young people, which he continued to do until he reached 100. He attributed his longevity to his vegetarianism, adopted long before it was fashionable, and to his all-absorbing passion for dance.

2/18/2022,"The percentage of adults in the US who identify as LGBTQ+ has doubled over the past 10 years, a Gallup study has found.  According to poll results released Thursday, a record 7.1% of American adults identify as LGBTQ+, jumping from 3.5% in 2012. “The increase in LGBT identification in recent years largely reflects the higher prevalence of such identities among the youngest US adults compared with the older generations they are replacing in the US adult population,” Gallup noted of the poll, which was conducted in 2021 on 12,416 American adults. The poll also found that 21% of Generation-Z Americans – those born between 1997 and 2003 – who have reached adulthood identify as LGBTQ, more than double the proportion of millennial adults who do so. Among millennials – those born between 1981 and 1996 – 10.5% identify as LGBTQ+. This marks a modest 4.7% increase from 2012, when some members of the generation had not yet turned 18. The percentages are even smaller among Generation X, baby boomers and “traditionalists” – all below 10%. Only 4.2% of Generation X adults, who are between 42 and 57, identify as LGBTQ. 2.6% of baby boomers, who are between 58 and 76, identify as LGBTQ. Lastly, among traditionalist adults – those born before 1946 – only 0.8% identify as LGBTQ+. Those percentages have more or less remained unchanged since Gallup started measuring LGBTQ+ identification in 2012. In addition, the poll found that more than half of LGBTQ+ Americans, 57%, identify as bisexual, making up 4% of the total US adult population. Twenty-one per cent of LGBTQ+ Americans identify as gay, 14% lesbian, 10% transgender and 4% something else. Nearly one in six Gen Z adults, or 15%, identify as bisexual. Meanwhile, 6% of millennials and 2% of Gen Xers say they are bisexual. The percentages of those who identify as bisexual among Generation X, baby boomers and traditionalists fall below 2%. According to the study, women, 6%, are more likely than men, 2%, to indicate that they are bisexual. Men are more likely to identify as gay, 2.5%, than bisexual. Gallup predicts that with one in 10 millennials and one in five Gen-Z members identifying as LGBTQ+, the proportion of LGBTQ+ American adults should exceed 10% in the near future. “These young adults [Generation Z] are coming of age, including coming to terms with their sexuality or gender identity, at a time when Americans increasingly accept gays, lesbians and transgender people, and LGBT individuals enjoy increasing legal protection against discrimination,” Gallup said.

2/18/2022,"A judge has approved a decision to allow any transgender person in Scotland to select male or female as their sex in this year’s census without holding a gender recognition certificate. Lord Sandison, a civil court judge sitting in Edinburgh, threw out a legal challenge by the feminist group Fair Play for Women, which had gone to court to block that question from being asked.  Fair Play for Women argued that people were lawfully allowed to answer that question based only on their legally recognised sex, either from their birth certificate or gender recognition certificate. National Records for Scotland, the government agency, will now publish census returns asking the question “what is your sex”, and offer two options of male and female. About 2.5m households will be asked to complete it. Its guidance reads: “If you are transgender, the answer you give can be different from what is on your birth certificate. You do not need a gender recognition certificate.” In a judgment issued 14 days after hearing the challenge, Sandison ruled there was no legal requirement to insist on legal proof of sex for the census, which will be on 20 March. Sandison said government agencies recognised sex and gender in different ways, and as the census legislation did not adjudicate one way or the other on the issue, Scottish ministers were able to set the question this way. “In the modern age, where social change has meant that such issues are much more openly and widely discussed and debated, I would find it impossible to find that the word ‘sex’ in a statute enabling the general population to be asked questions for the wide and general purposes for which a census is conducted falls to be regarded as restricted in the sense for which the petitioner contends,” he wrote. “Rather, I would accept the suggestion that biological sex, sex recognised by law, or self-identified (or ‘lived’) sex as at the date of the census are all capable of being comprehended within the word.” Fair Play for Women said they were disappointed with the ruling and would be pressing for an urgent appeal. “The guidance proposed for the sex question will jeopardise the collection of accurate data on sex in the Scottish census and erodes the harmonisation of data collected via censuses across the UK,” the group said. Vic Valentine, of the pro-trans campaign group Scottish Trans Alliance, welcomed the judge’s ruling. “Scotland’s census is meant to count everyone in Scotland as who they are on census day, and the guidance provided reassures trans men and trans women that this is the same for them as it is for everyone else,” they said. “This is an important decision: clearly stating that all trans men and trans women are able to be counted on the census as who they are, not just those who have changed the sex on their birth certificate.”",News/Society,"Transgender people can self-identify in Scottish census, confirms judge",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/17/transgender-people-can-self-identify-in-scottish-census-confirms-judge

Having been the birthplace of the first industrial revolution in the 18th century, the idea is that the UK can again lead the way in the next phase of technological development. There is a 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution as a statement of intent.  All of which sounds mightily impressive. The problem is the claims of global leadership don’t tally with the hard data. Turnover in the low-carbon and renewable energy sector was the same in 2020 as in 2014. The number of people employed has actually fallen by 28,000 to just over 200,000. To take a specific example, at the last count there were only 2,300 people working in the booming offshore wind sector – down by a third since the middle of the last decade. The reason is simple. Unlike oil and gas rigs, nobody works full-time on the turbines and their manufacture has been outsourced to other countries. It is the same story in solar, where employment has dropped by 40% to 4,300. To be clear, the lack of tangible progress is not due to the pandemic, because jobs and turnover – according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics – were both flatlining even before the arrival of Covid-19. There are those who think the picture is brighter than the ONS figures suggest. Venture capital, they say, is alert to the opportunities to make money out of greening the economy and investment in new businesses is expanding fast. Even if the optimists are right, there is a long way to go. The problem could be a lack of commercially viable ideas, a lack of finance, a lack of government investment – or a combination of all three. But Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, is right when she says Britain risks losing out to countries that modernise faster. There is a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality. Debt relief for the world’s poorest countries is way down the list of priorities for finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 at the meeting chaired by Indonesia. While that’s unsurprising at a time of soaring energy prices, rising inflation and supply bottlenecks, it is also shortsighted. The membership of the G20 includes the biggest developed and developing countries, and in the early stages of the pandemic it took steps to help the poorest nations. Debt repayments were suspended and a mechanism – the common framework – was created to provide longer-term relief. Results have been disappointing. Some creditors refused to take part in the temporary debt-suspension initiative, which has now expired. Three countries – Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia – have signed up for help through the common framework but none has yet received any assistance. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund says 60% of low-income countries are in debt distress or at high risk of it. The World Bank calculates debt repayments from 74 low-income countries will be $35bn (£26bn) this year – double the total in 2020. This is a debt crisis waiting to happen and decisive action from the G20 could still avert it. Debt relief needs to be swifter and it needs to be more generous. A workable scheme can’t just involve sovereign creditors: the G20 should insist the private sector takes part on the same terms. The credibility of the G20 is at stake here. Its critics say, with justification, that meetings have become global talking shops where participants indulge in virtue signalling and point scoring but achieve next to nothing. If the G20 can’t deliver a workable solution to the debts of low-income countries there really is no point to it. Although the details are scanty, peace has broken out in the credit card charges war between Amazon and Visa, as was always going to be the case. The online retail giant was never going to stop its UK customers paying with Visa but bridled at what it considered too steep an increase in transaction fees for both credit and debit cards. In order to secure lower transaction fees, Amazon had to say that it was prepared to go nuclear. The fact that neither side is saying much about the deal suggests both are relatively happy with the outcome.",News/Environment,Hard data blows apart UK rhetoric on leading the way to a green economy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/hard-data-blows-apart-uk-rhetoric-on-leading-the-way-to-a-green-economy
2/18/2022,"All-party parliamentary groups may be informal, but they provide a great service in our democracy. In good hands, they can foster better relations with other countries, keep a weather eye on an authoritarian regime, or bring into sharp focus a policy issue that may otherwise have been forgotten. In that vein, I set up the APPG on acquired brain injury, which produced a report with a list of recommendations after a series of round tables with patients, families and practitioners. Just before Christmas, that bore fruit in the shape of a government commitment to launch a new national strategy on the issue. So an APPG can make a big difference, and the vast majority are run simply and cheaply on the back of the enthusiasm of a few MPs and peers without any extra spending.  It’s also an important way of baking cross-party working into the system. No MP can launch their own APPG with the support of their party colleagues alone – they need support from across the benches. But I worry that the number of APPGs has risen dramatically in the last few years. Instead of one cancer APPG, there are now more than a dozen. Some industries are especially well-resourced, with every part of the supply chain and every trade body getting its own group. Some countries have more than one. We now have more APPGs than we do MPs. It sometimes feels as if every MP wants their own APPG, and every lobbying company sees them as an ideal way to make a quick buck out of a trade or industry body. “Look,” they say, “if you really want to get this on the agenda politically, we can get you access to MPs, peers and ministers – but the more financial support you give the APPG (through us, of course) the more effective the group will be.” Hence the rise in the number of APPGs that are serviced by lobbying, PR or communications companies. There are several problems with this. For a start, nobody should be touting access or influence on behalf of an APPG. Second, the rules on what APPGs have to register are pretty clear, but until now this has virtually been a self-policing area of policy. The Commons authorities have neither the powers nor resources to investigate every APPG, and since we abolished the requirement to get permission to launch a new one, the only substantial requirement for an APPG to keep going is to hold an annual general meeting. Sometimes these are so poorly attended as to make one question whether they are really an APPG or just a personal campaign or money-making venture masquerading as a parliamentary affair. I don’t think anyone is concerned when an APPG is supported by a charity. (The acquired brain injury APPG, incidentally, is supported by the UK ABI Forum.) But it may be time for us to ban commercial operators from acting as the secretariat for APPGs, unless they can prove a public interest and enough interest from a larger number of MPs and peers. When lobbying firms are effectively driving a group in the interests of their clients, we should not only know who those clients are, but we should be able to close down the group where there is a clear conflict of interest. Which takes me to another point. The House of Commons and the Lords both have formal select committees covering all the government departments. Proceedings in these committees, and their publications, are covered by parliamentary privilege, which is an important aspect of ensuring MPs and peers can speak without fear or favour. It would be – and is – wrong for any APPG to give the impression that one of its reports or publications has a parliamentary imprimatur or seal of approval. Newspaper editors would be well advised to stop referring vaguely to “a committee of MPs” and to start drawing a clear distinction between the authorised, privileged work of a select committee and the unauthorised work of an APPG. If you have evidence of something that doesn’t smell right in the way an APPG is run, the Committee on Standards on Public Life will run an inquiry into it. We can’t investigate individual groups, but we’d be happy to hear from you as background for our inquiry. I certainly don’t want to curtail the work of APPGs so much that their valuable work comes to an end. They are a vital tool in many backbench MPs’ campaigning armoury. But if an APPG feels like front-of-house for a direct commercial interest or a cover for free trips to exotic locations, or if it’s the brainchild of a lobbying company, then MPs and peers should run a mile. Chris Bryant is the Labour MP for Rhondda",Opinion/Opinion,MPs’ groups are taking millions from private interests – that can’t go unchecked  | Chris Bryant,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/17/mps-groups-millions-private-interests-all-party-parliamentary-groups
2/18/2022,"For charities and campaigning backbenchers like the late Sir David Amess, all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) are vital platforms for a plethora of good causes and interest areas they wish to promote. To their critics, they can appear as unreformed relics of a past, less-regulated Westminster landscape. But amid the swirl of roundtable discussions, drinks, overseas trips and reports, dozens of communications and public affairs companies are helping to run more than 100 such groups, out of a total of 755, with sponsorship from corporate interests.  The full reach of lobbyists acting as APPG secretariats – arranging meetings and trips for members and sometimes cultivating potential funders – is revealed in analysis by the Guardian and openDemocracy. A framework of rules applies to APPGs, setting out how to register if they wish to use parliamentary emblems and how to list the details of any secretariats. However, the system is largely self-policed. Connect Communications, which is co-owned and run by the former Labour MP Andy Sawford, runs the secretariats of 14 APPGs. Policy Connect, a not-for-profit company that has held meetings attended by paying businesses and ministers, runs the secretariats of nine APPGs, covering issues ranging from climate change to data analytics. It said that any private meetings involving ministers were always led by the APPG chair. Healthcare firms provided the bulk of about £250,000 worth of financial benefits-in-kind support registered in 2021 for six APPG secretariats operated by HealthComms Consulting, the lobbying firm founded by Paul Bristow, the current Conservative MP for Peterborough, and now run by his wife, Sara Petela. Her firm acts as the secretariat of the APPGs on adult social care, obesity, sepsis, women’s health, vascular and venous disease, and minimally invasive cancer therapies. HealthComms Consulting was renamed in 2020 from its previous incarnation, PB Consulting, which had been founded by Bristow and had offered clients services such as “NHS market access” and “parliamentary awareness”. Bristow, a former lobbying industry leader who sits on the Commons health select committee, was embroiled in controversy in 2020 when he submitted questions to ministers on a range of health issues linked to the lobbying firm without raising a potential conflict of interest, though he subsequently declared the link. Bristow told the Guardian he had led calls to ban MPs from lobbying and to “clean up the system”, adding: “When doing so, I have been very clear about my wife’s role and I don’t have any involvement with her company, which follows the PRCA [Public Relations and Communications Association] self-regulatory code of conduct. “I also support changes to the rules on APPGs because there are far too many and most are pointless. The ones with secretariats tend to be more effective and those arrangements are declared.” Four APPGs list their secretariats as the College Green Group, a political consultancy founded by Vote Leave’s former chief technology officer, Thomas Borwick. The company’s website previously claimed that “under 10% of APPGs currently achieve their full potential” and offered parliamentarians the chance to “let us catapult your APPG to the top of the league table” by creating “a coalition of organisations and businesses as affiliates or supporters to recruit sponsors” for a fee. College Green, which said it removed the text in the course of a website upgrade, told the Guardian that “league table” was shorthand for how some APPGs achieve more than others in terms of activity. It now describes its role as secretariat for the groups as “allowing for cross-party, issue-based problem solving, with high-level activity and management”. Asked how it recruited sponsors of APPGs, College Green Group said: “We engage with businesses and organisations that have an authentic interest in the topic of focus for each APPG. Based on these conversations we make recommendations to the APPG and, if all parties are in agreement, we engage the sponsors.” The corporate governance APPG received money from British American Tobacco, Deloitte, PwC and others, with support totalling well over £100,000 in recent years to pay for a secretariat run by Jennifer Bryant-Pearson, a lobbyist.",News/Politics,From climate to health: the private firms helping to run MPs’ interest groups,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/from-climate-to-health-the-private-firms-helping-to-run-mps-interest-groups
2/18/2022,"More than £13m has been poured into a growing network of MPs’ interest groups by private firms including healthcare bodies, arms companies and tech giants, fuelling concerns over the potential for backdoor influence. Analysis by the Guardian and openDemocracy found that more than half the total £25m in funding for all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) since 2018 has come from the private sector.  Other funds for the 755 groups – a number that has ballooned from 560 five years ago – came from charities and trade unions. On Thursday, the chair of the Commons standards committee, Chris Bryant, for the first time called for parliamentary authorities to have the power to shut down the largely self-policed groups where there are clear conflicts of interest. Writing for the Guardian, he said it may be time to ban commercial operators from funding and running APPGs: “When lobbying firms are effectively driving an APPG in the interests of their clients, we should not only know who those clients are, but we should be able to close the group down where there is a clear conflict of interest.” Bryant, whose standards committee has opened an inquiry into the system, added: “It feels as if every MP wants their own APPG, and every lobbying company sees an APPG as an ideal way of making a quick buck out of a trade or industry body.” APPGs are informal groups representing MPs’ and peers’ interests, from China and Russia to cancer, digital regulation, longevity and jazz. They must be chaired by MPs but are often run or funded by lobbyists and corporate donors seeking to influence government policy. The groups can play a key role in drawing parliament’s attention to overlooked issues, Bryant says. They host roundtables, produce reports, take overseas trips and lobby for change but receive no public money. A number of APPGs are sponsored by companies with interests in the policy areas the groups seek to influence. In situations where there is no conflict of interest, concerns may arise over the perception of one. Examples include: The obesity APPG, which has sought to promote medical interventions for obesity, received £178,500 to £183,000 between 2019 and 2021 from three private healthcare companies that make or promote gastric bands or drugs used in obesity surgery and treatment: Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Novo Nordisk. The support was used to pay for a lobbyist, HealthComms Consulting, to run the APPG’s secretariat. The lobbyist says on its website that the APPG promoted calls for “a shift away from the ‘move more, eat less’ mentality prevalent in obesity thinking and better utilisation of treatment for obesity and access to services”. It adds that the APPG “had direct input into the government’s obesity strategy published in July 2020 through meeting with No 10 officials and the development of a top 10 policy wishlist”. The company did not respond to a request for comment. MPs from the armed forces APPG took a trip to Bosnia last autumn as it stood on the brink of conflict, with hospitality and transport part-funded by an arms company, Lockheed Martin, and the defence support company CAE. Lockheed Martin’s head of government affairs accompanied them for one night and to a dinner. A Tory MP on the visit, James Sunderland, subsequently spoke in a Commons debate about the need for the UK to be “part of the solution in the country [Bosnia]” without declaring the trip’s funding. James Gray, the APPG’s chairman, said the trip should have been declared as paid for by the APPG, of whom Lockheed Martin and CAE are “merely sponsors”. He said the companies “had nothing to gain” from the trip, and the subscribers to the APPG “do so because they believe in having a good group of MPs and peers who understand defence”. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said funding for the visit “would have come from the APPG’s funds and not specifically from Lockheed Martin UK’s contributions”. Sunderland did not comment. In areas related to the climate crisis, the secretariat of the sustainable aviation APPG is an alliance of airlines and airports, while energy companies provided tens of thousands of pounds in the past year for the consultancy running the net zero APPG. Graham Brady, a senior Tory who chairs the sustainable aviation APPG, said it was formed to support collaboration between the aviation sector and parliament, adding: “The benefits in kind reported on the register represent routine secretarial work carried out to facilitate meetings of the group. No direct funding is involved and no benefits in kind have been given to members of the group.” Many APPGs have secretariats run by charities, trade unions and other organisations, which help with their administration and act as a contact point. A thriving industry has also emerged around professional lobbying companies, sponsored by corporate interests, helping to produce reports seeking to influence policy, fund dinners or drinks, and take parliamentarians on free trips abroad. The Guardian and openDemocracy analysis found that since 2018, APPGs have declared £5m in cash funding and £18.3m-£20.2m of “benefits in kind” support, which covers the provision of services, secretarial work, trips or hospitality. More than half of the sponsorship and donations – about £13m – came from private companies. APPGs have been at the centre of controversies but remain largely self-policed. Last month a fresh spotlight fell on the groups after it emerged that a woman at the centre of an MI5 security alert to MPs had provided support and funding for the now disbanded Chinese in Britain APPG. In September, MPs on the standards committee raised questions over the longevity APPG offering platinum, gold and bronze tiers of membership for sponsors, with a fee of up to £100,000 for access to meetings with the group’s members. The APPG said it had dropped the scheme and no sponsor was ever involved in tiered membership. The largest APPG, the parliamentary internet, communications and technology forum (Pictfor), received more than £125,000 worth of benefits-in-kind support last year alone, from firms including Google, Facebook, TikTok, BT, Amazon and Huawei. The group also runs a tiered membership, with rates ranging from £500 for charities to £5,000 for large corporations, for “benefits” such as access to events. Pictfor denied any similarity to the longevity APPG scheme and said its membership did not represent a tiered system of opportunity or influence over the group or its members, but rather protected against it. Analysis of a range of other APPGs underlines the links between the MPs’ groups and private firms. The secretariat for the British bioethanol APPG is listed as Ensus UK, which operates one of the UK’s largest biofuel plants. After the APPG submitted a report to the government calling for the introduction of E10 fuel, which uses biofuel of the type manufactured by Ensus, a meeting was held between the APPG’s chair, a government minister and the commercial director of Ensus UK. Ensus said its support and “modest financial contribution” towards the APPG’s work on E10 was a matter of public record. New coronavirus-related APPGs include business in a pandemic (Covid) world, which has declared £49,000 of benefits-in-kind support for its secretariat, the lobbyist Wychwood Consulting, from a Covid diagnostics company, Cignpost. Neither Wychwood nor Cignpost responded to requests for comment. Wychwood also gets £10,000 to £12,000 of benefits-in-kind sponsorship from Yoti Ltd, a facial recognition company, to run the APPG on digital identity. Yoti said it was open about its sponsorship of the APPG, which provides a unique service to parliamentarians as a forum to discuss and educate them on digital identity. Arms companies are particularly active, with firms including BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and the missile maker Raytheon supporting the armed forces APPG with £256,000 over four years. A Lockheed Martin UK spokesperson said: “This support is openly and transparently registered in the register of APPGs.” The technology and national security APPG, formed in 2020, received support worth up to £39,000 from Rebellion Defence Ltd, a US-UK defence AI company which has the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt as an investor and board member, among others. The “benefit in kind” support allows for the APPG’s secretariat to be provided by an Oxford University defence studies centre where one of Rebellion’s co-founders is a research fellow. Rebellion Defence and the APPG declined to comment. All APPGs must be registered and provide funding details but most do not produce or make readily available a detailed breakdown. They are obliged to provide accounts on request, but half of 190 APPGs failed to do so when asked by openDemocracy. APPGs are required only to complete a simple “template for income and expenditure statement” but this does not give the opportunity to provide many details. The alternative dispute resolution APPG’s form listed £4,501-£6,000 for secretariat services and £13,501-£16,000 for a visit to Singapore, with no further detail. The group was approached for comment. Some APPGs, such as the group for the Celtic Sea and another for the wood panel industry, have a lobbyist as a secretariat but no figures for funding were published on their parliamentary registration page. Their chair was contacted for comment. Some other APPGs gave fuller details. On the comprehensive Pictfor website, accounts were uploaded to its blog section. Steve Goodrich, of Transparency International, said: “From big tobacco to kleptocratic regimes, there are a plethora of interests behind these groups that remain [largely] unchecked by formal rules. Without greater transparency over lobbying, much of what happens in these groups will remain behind closed doors.” The government did not comment.",News/Politics,Lobbying fears as MPs’ interest groups receive £13m from private firms,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/lobbying-fears-as-mps-interest-groups-receive-13m-from-private-firms
2/18/2022,"Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has been criticised after saying she wants police to “shoot your terrorists and ask questions second.” Speaking to Matt Forde’s Political Party podcast, Rayner said she was “quite hardline” on law and order and suggested police should “antagonise” criminals.  “On things like law and order I am quite hardline. I am like, shoot your terrorists and ask questions second,” Rayner told the live audience at the podcast recording. After a loud audience reaction, she said. “Sorry – is that the most controversial thing I’ve ever said?” “On law and order, I think if you are being terrorised by the local thug, I want a copper to come and sort them out,” she said. “You should be hardline on things like that. It’s not just, ‘Oh you’ve been burgled here is a crime number’.” She added: “I want you to beat down the door of the criminals and sort them out and antagonise them. That’s what I say to my local police … three o’clock in the morning and antagonise them.” Rayner said she had formed her views after being “plagued by antisocial behaviour” when she was growing up. “I want the police to annoy the hell out of them until they realise disrupting lives is not OK. I am quite hardline on that,” she said. Rayner has also spoken out recently about receiving extensive online abuse and death threats. Among those criticising Rayner was the former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who said: “Is Angela suggesting a mandatory death sentence for suspected (but not convicted) “terrorists” ?” she tweeted. Rayner was also criticised by the leftwing grassroots group Momentum. Sonali Bhattacharyya, of Momentum’s national coordinating group, said: “These remarks are deeply concerning. It was this approach that led to the assassination of Jean Charles de Menezes. “You can’t kneel for racial justice one day, then praise shoot-to-kill powers for the police the next. “From regressive drug policy to abandoning the rule of law, Labour are trying to out-Tory the Tories. But it’s working class communities and people of colour who pay the price for this law and order agenda. In the party and the streets, our movement will stand up for social justice.” Corbyn himself had been vocally against “shoot to kill” policies. “I think that is quite dangerous and I think it can often be counterproductive. I think you have to have security which prevents people firing off weapons where you can and there are various degrees of doing things, as we know, but the idea you end up with a war on the streets is not a good thing,” he said in 2015.",News/Politics,Angela Rayner: police should ‘shoot terrorists and ask questions second’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/angela-rayner-police-should-shoot-terrorists-and-ask-questions-second
2/18/2022,"The regional president of Madrid has accused the leadership of her own conservative People’s party (PP) of waging a “cruel and unfair” campaign to destroy her with false corruption allegations amid reports the party tried to hire private detectives to investigate her family. Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who is often touted as a future PP leader, spoke out after media reports suggested that, during the first wave of the Covid pandemic, her administration gave a €1.5m contract for face masks to a company linked to her brother – for which he received a commission.  The reports also alleged that an official in Madrid city hall – which is also run by the PP – contacted a firm of private detectives with a view to getting them to investigate Ayuso and her family. Relations between Ayuso and the PP’s leader, Pablo Casado, have been fraught over recent months. While Ayuso has bolstered her national and international profile since winning an emphatic victory in last year’s Madrid regional election, Casado has faced questions over his leadership strategies – not least the party’s recent, pyrrhic victory in last week’s Castilla y León regional election. On Thursday morning, the PP mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, said he had looked into the reports that his administration had sought to hire a detective firm to spy on Ayuso and her family, and said he had found no evidence of such an arrangement. A little later, Ayuso went on the offensive. “Even though political life is full of heartaches, I could never have imagined that the national leadership of my party would act against me in such a cruel and unfair way,” she said in a televised address. “There is nothing more serious than accusing someone in your own house, and who has a responsibility to govern, of corruption.” Ayuso said that PP leaders had spent months putting together a dossier on her and her family in an attempt to associate them with corruption when all the party had to do was look at publicly available documents relating to the contract. “The fact that they were preparing a file means that they weren’t searching for any truth; they were trying to smear me personally and politically,” she said. Ayuso did not deny that the face mask contract had been awarded to a company linked to her brother, but she insisted the process had been completely legal. “I asked my brother and he confirmed that he had had a business relationship with the company and that it was all completely legal, and that everything had been declared to the tax authorities,” she said. She also challenged Casado and his circle to provide any proof whatsoever of wrongdoing, and pointed to her own electoral success. “I’d like to know how many votes those who have spent months attacking me have won for the PP,” she said. “It’s very hurtful that the leaders of your party are not the ones who support you, but the ones who want to destroy you.” The PP’s general secretary, Teodoro García Egea, hit back at Ayuso later on Thursday, saying that it had only sought her cooperation in examining the allegations, and adding that an investigation had been launched. “Since we received information about these alleged irregularities over the summer and asked Isabel Díaz Ayuso about their veracity, all we’ve got from that direction – instead of a clear answer – is a massive campaign of attacks, packs of lies and slanders like the ones we’ve had today,” he said.

2/18/2022,"A former Post Office branch manager’s young children were bullied and told their mum was a “liar” and a “thief” during the company’s IT system scandal, an inquiry has heard. More than 700 post office operators were prosecuted between 2000 and 2014, based on information from the Horizon IT system, which was installed and maintained by Fujitsu.  Susan Hazzleton, 68, said her children, who were nine at the time, were taunted in the school playground when her Post Office branch in Chelmsford, Essex closed in 2001. Her children were told that their mother was a “liar”, a “thief” and that she was “the reason the village doesn’t have a Post Office or shop any more”, Hazzleton said during the fourth day of evidence. The former post office operator was accused of stealing £300 after auditors checked the accounts of the branch she had run since 1995. She was suspended, her shop closed and six weeks later she was arrested for theft. “[The police] said I couldn’t go and pick the children up from school; they said they would collect them in the police car, take them to the station and they would have to stay there until they finished questioning me,” Hazzleton recalled. “What mother wants that for her children?” Thankfully, her children were able to stay with a family friend. The prosecution dropped the case 18 months later due to a lack of evidence. Hazzleton said Post Office workers told her that no one else was having issues with the Horizon IT system like the ones that she told them she had been having. She said that the shortfalls in her accounts began to “snowball” into the thousands in 2000 after she began using the Horizon system. She said she called the Post Office helpline once a week but received no help. The call handler repeatedly told her: “It will work itself out”, the inquiry heard. “I believed the people operating the helpline had no more idea about the computer system than I did,” she said. After her evidence, the former judge, Sir Wyn Williams, leading the inquiry, indicated he was unhappy that the compensation scheme for those wrongly convicted did not apply to those who were acquitted as well. Wendy Martin, who opened her own Post Office in York in February 2015, said she was left feeling like a “walking zombie” due to the stress of dealing with repeated IT problems. She told the inquiry: “I was open for just under two years and I probably slept five hours a week if that. “I was getting so many kidney infections constantly that my doctor would leave my prescriptions in reception without me having to go in because I didn’t have time to go into the doctors. “My staff were so stressed out that one of them left; she couldn’t deal with it any more. We were all just falling apart.” She said there were issues with the Horizon computer system immediately after taking over the branch. “I just know that we had gone from an office that worked to where I was coming home of a night and I just didn’t know where the cash figures would sit,” she said. “I would check my figures and check the cash and it would show a discrepancy and I’d think, what have I done?” Martin was never prosecuted but has still been left thousands of pounds in debt. She added: “I’ve lost my business and that business was my retirement. I don’t have a retirement; I’ve worked for the Post Office for 16 years and walked away with nothing.” The inquiry, which is expected to run for the rest of the year, is looking into whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system and will also ask how staff were made to take the blame. On Wednesday, a group of cross-party MPs called on the government to fully compensate all victims.",News/Business,"Innocent Post Office manager’s children told she was a ‘thief’, hears inquiry",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/innocent-post-office-managers-children-told-she-was-a-thief-hears-inquiry
