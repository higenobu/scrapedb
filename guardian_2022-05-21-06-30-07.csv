5/21/2022,"Frank Lampard has said Everton have no divine right to their Premier League status and must improve in the summer to avoid a repeat of this season’s relegation struggle. Lampard achieved his immediate task of securing Everton’s survival with Thursday’s dramatic comeback defeat of Crystal Palace. After the raucous celebrations, however, he turned his attention to the rebuilding work required and admitted Everton could not take for granted their 68-year residence in the top flight. The Everton manager, asked whether the club were too big to be fighting relegation, said: “Yes, but is it? What right does Everton have to be Premier League safe every year and think that will continue forever more? There are a lot of decisions that have to be made and performances that we have to do and my job has to be done as well as it can be to make sure that happens. “We need to try and find improvements to make sure it is not but nothing is given. We were in that position because we deserved to be. It is important to say that. We don’t want to be here next season but we understand if we don’t make positive moves it could be possible. So we will be ready to move on that quickly. “I don’t think we can expect 10,000 people to turn up and parade us in every game. It doesn’t work that way. The fans have dragged us over the line with that kind of behaviour. But at the same time, we as a club need to start fresh from zero next season, which is a nice thing, especially for me to come in with a pre-season and start at zero rather than looking downwards, and make the decisions in the meantime that mean we improve.” Lampard has established a good working relationship with Kevin Thelwell, who was appointed as the director of football in February, and said plans were in place for the summer, despite the uncertainty that had surrounded the club’s future. “We have been working behind the scenes,” he said. “I have a great relationship with Kevin in terms of where I feel we can move forward with the squad and not just that, but structurally so we can be better from day to day. My biggest thing here is that I want a happy, determined camp that moves in the same direction and that is something we have to look at. Those conversations have started.” Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison and Jordan Pickford have been linked with summer moves but, despite Everton’s recent financial losses, Lampard insists he has not been told so far that he must sell to buy. He said: “If I had my way let me keep players who perform really well for the club and let us get as far up the table as we can, but we will see about that.”",Sport/Football,‘There are a lot of decisions to be made’: Lampard cautious after Everton survive,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/there-are-a-lot-of-decisions-to-be-made-frank-lampard-cautious-after-everton-survive
5/21/2022,"Mikel Arteta has conceded that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be a missed opportunity for Arsenal given that, for long periods of the run-in, they had their destiny in their own hands. Arsenal will have to settle for Europa League football in 2022-23 unless they beat Everton on Sunday and, improbably, Tottenham are defeated at relegated Norwich. Fifth place and a return to continental competition would still count as laudable progress but Arteta’s team were in control of fourth place until chastening defeats at Spurs and Newcastle in the last nine days. A generally positive season could also go down as a chance spurned. “It will be for sure because we were there, mathematically it was possible and it was in our hands,” Arteta said. “That feeling could be there if it happens, and it will take some time to take away, but that is part of football. You cannot take notice of what happened a week or two weeks ago, whether it was positive or negative, because it’s not going to have an impact on anything.” Arsenal have lost 13 games this season, six of those coming in their past 11, and Arteta accepted that correcting that statistic is “the challenge we have in front of us”. They are 24 points behind leaders Manchester City, having finished last season 25 off the pace, and the deficit needs to narrow if his long-term plans are to be realised. “A big gap,” he said. “The league doesn’t lie and you have to be very realistic in the way you want to recruit and the way you’re going to move forward, because that’s the level [the title chasers] have set. We’ve lost many games, we’ve lost four games playing with 10 men, which those teams don’t do. So there is a lot to learn.” Once Arsenal know their fate, Arteta will talk to Gareth Southgate about how best to handle Bukayo Saka during England’s four Nations League games in June. Saka is Arsenal’s top scorer but has looked tired in recent weeks and Arteta hopes common sense will be applied in the way he is deployed. “He needs a break, that is for sure,” he said. “He’s played a lot of minutes this season and he played a lot of minutes last season. You expect your important players to do so, but obviously you have to bear in mind that at some stage he needs a rest. That is something we really need to think about: the plans for him in the summer. “We are going to [talk to Southgate]. We are going to talk to every manager that is responsible for our players. Everything has to be connected and related to the aim of protecting the player and getting the best out of the player.”",Sport/Football,"Arsenal finish outside top four would be self-inflicted wound, admits Arteta",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/arsenal-top-four-mikel-arteta-everton-preview
5/21/2022,"After enjoying a solid clay court season, nonetheless filled with various injury niggles, Emma Raducanu arrives at her first senior French Open content with her progress but still figuring out how to optimally manage her body as a professional athlete. Raducanu says that she is still in the process of learning about her body, and she has been increasing her work in the gym in the hope of strengthening it and building up its resistance to injuries. “I think it’s something I’m definitely learning to enjoy with each bit that I do,” she said of her focus on gym work. “I kind of get that positive reinforcement and I feel really good about myself and each time I feel like even if I do a little bit, I’m getting better and it’s something that I think helps you mentally as well if you know that you definitely put the work in. I’m gonna be out there, I’m gonna outlast or be fitter than my opponent on the other side of the court and it’s definitely something that I want to continue.” Raducanu arrived in Paris on Thursday, her first time back at the French Open since she contested the junior event in 2018, and in the afternoon she trained before a crowd on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Such is the enduring buzz around her, a solid crowd was on show to watch her play and cheer her various drop shots. After retiring against Bianca Andreescu with a back injury in Rome and appearing unsure of whether she would be fit in time for the French Open, she says she is moving freely now and enjoying her practices again. “I’m learning about my body, for sure, but I’m very happy to be continuing my preparations for the French Open and to be able to play this tournament and fortunately I didn’t have to miss this grand slam,” said Raducanu. “That is definitely a really positive thing because I really look forward to these big moments and the big tournaments.” The draw has been fair to Raducanu and she stands a chance of piecing together victories in Paris if she is healthy. She begins against a qualifier and the first seeded opponent she could face is the former world No 1 Angelique Kerber, who is notorious for her dislike of clay courts and has lifted the trophy at all grand slams apart from Roland Garros. Regardless of how she fares this year, perhaps the biggest revelation for Raducanu is how much she has embraced the surface and how much she believes the surface has embraced her game, something she was not sure about at the beginning of the swing. “I think that I have definitely come a long way and probably progressed faster than expected in the last few weeks and I really am enjoying the clay. To be honest, I think I’m enjoying it more than I thought I would. Clay at the beginning kind of was like written off: ‘Oh, it’s a clay court, just have a go.’ But now I really believe that I can be good and faster than I thought it would be,” she said. A week after he suffered a flare-up of his chronic foot injury during his loss to Denis Shapovalov at the Italian Open and gave a sobering description of his situation afterwards, Rafael Nadal spoke with notable optimism about his presence in Paris. Nadal, who is trying to establish his top form after a fractured rib halted his 20-0 start to the season, said that the foot problem he suffered in Rome is something he has to accept. The pain will always be present and the important point is whether he can manage it. “It is something that I live every day with, so is nothing new for me and is not a big surprise. So I am here just to play tennis and to try to make the best result possible here in Roland Garros, no? And if I don’t believe that this thing can happen, probably I will not be here,” he said. Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, was unmoved by the news that Nadal stands as a potential quarter-final opponent, even as he identified Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz as the other big tournament favourites. “I feel I am always in that contention to fight for any grand slam trophy,” he said. “I believe in my own abilities to get far and to fight for one of the most prestigious trophies in the world of tennis. As a defending champion, of course, more so, to believe I can do it again.”",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu enjoys the buzz in Paris as she keeps focus on gym work,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/emma-raducanu-enjoys-the-buzz-in-paris-as-she-keeps-focus-on-gym-work
5/21/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has said Liverpool will remain “in the neck” of Manchester City whatever happens in Sunday’s Premier League finale and are under no pressure because they have nothing to lose. Liverpool must beat Wolves and hope City fail to overcome Aston Villa on the final day of the season to pip Pep Guardiola’s side to the title. The situation is identical to the end of the 2018-19 season, when Liverpool beat Wolves 2-0 at Anfield but missed out on the championship by a single point after City’s 4-1 win at Brighton. Klopp’s team responded by winning the Champions League final three weeks later. Even in the event of a repeat on Sunday, the Liverpool manager insists his team will not stop making life uncomfortable for their main Premier League rivals. “After that game [Wolves in 2019] I was fine with the situation,” said Klopp. “I remember walking on the lap of honour next to Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. We both had a smile on our faces because it was a great season. And whatever happens on Sunday, I will not forget that it has been an absolutely fantastic season. “The biggest defeats in my life have led to the biggest successes in my life, wherever I was. Whether it was Mainz or whatever, it’s a little bit like this. Even if we don’t win the Champions League final, I learned at Mainz when we didn’t get promoted and we arrived back and thought it’d be really sad but we had 20,000 people waiting for us. We had to go on stage the day after we lost our dream of going to the Bundesliga. That was the moment we realised it was OK and if they think it was fine then we can go from here. The response [of fans] is really important and whatever happens on Sunday we will not stop. We will not stop trying. Yes, we have the best opponent in world football, which is a bit of a shame, but they have us in their neck, which is not too cool as well. So let’s see.” Klopp insisted his squad did not feel the pressure of chasing part three of a possible quadruple because, unlike City, the Premier League title is not in their hands. “I cannot talk about pressure for the other team but, for us, there is no pressure,” he said. “We know that we have to win the football game but we’ve had that now for a while. If you have something to lose it feels different, but we don’t have that.” Klopp does not buy the romantic notion that the Liverpool legend and Villa manager Steven Gerrard can be a decisive factor in his old club winning the title. “If I would play a game and could help Dortmund or Mainz that would be, for me, an extra motivation - but I don’t play,” he said. “And Stevie doesn’t play. That is a shame, much more of a shame that Stevie is not playing than I am not playing. Stevie will take it 100% serious, without me calling him or whatever. The rest of the club probably already did it but I didn’t. “A really good example of how motivated football teams are to fulfil their own targets is last night’s game for Crystal Palace. It was such an important game, one of the most important games in Everton’s history, and then Palace show up and play incredible football. They lost, but the whole game from Palace was really good. Congratulations by the way to Everton for staying in the league.” Klopp confirmed Divock Origi would be leaving the club when his contract expires this summer. The Anfield cult hero has agreed a move to Milan. “I think it’s only Div, right?” he said of the guaranteed farewells at Anfield on Sunday. “I expect Div to get a special reception. He is, and will be for me, forever a Liverpool legend, one of the most important players I ever had. That might sound strange with the amount of games he had but it was a pure joy to work together. It is not over yet.”",Sport/Football,"Liverpool will remain pain in neck of Manchester City, says Jürgen Klopp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/liverpool-will-remain-pain-in-neck-of-manchester-city-says-jurgen-klopp
