3/9/2022,"Ukraine is receiving a steady flow of Soviet-made weapons to fight off Russia. According to the Wall Street Journal, NATO countries have sent Ukraine 17,000 anti-tank weapons. Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland have re-supplied Ukraine with Soviet-era weapons. A large portion of the weapons being sent to Ukraine for its efforts to fight off Russian forces is Soviet-made weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. So far, multiple weeks into Russia's war on Ukraine, allies in NATO have sent 17,000 antitank weapons to Ukraine. The majority of weapons are coming from Central European NATO countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union. Czech Republic has sent the most equipment, according to the report. Some of the Soviet-made weapons include 12 Dragunov rifles and Strela-2 shoulder-fired missiles sent by Czech Republic, according to Reuters, as well as the 73mm BWP1 and SPG-9 ammunition sent by Poland. Slovakia has also sent 12,000 rounds of Soviet-made anti-tank ammunition. On Tuesday, Poland announced that it would deliver all of its MiG-29s fighter jets, which are Soviet-made planes, to a US airbase in Germany, which would allow the US to then transfer the fleet to Ukraine. Following Poland's announcement, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that the plan, ""raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance."" ""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,"" Kirby tweeted. ""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one."" Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly called on NATO to declare a no-fly zone over the country as Russia has continued its aerial campaign across the country. NATO has resisted the call, worrying that a no-fly zone could escalate the war across the continent. Russian forces have waged an intense war on Ukraine since late February, engaging in heavy shelling and missile attacks that have hit residential buildings, an orphanage, kindergartens, and a children's hospital, according to the Ukrainian government. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and Kyiv, the country's capital, have both been under intense shelling and airstrikes, and Kherson, Ukraine's third-largest city, was captured by Russia last week. Russia's campaign so far has united Western nations in unprecedented ways, who have also unleashed wide-ranging sanctions on Putin and his allies, while global businesses and news outlets have ceased operations in Russia.

3/9/2022,"Alec Baldwin is speaking out about the slew of lawsuits filed over the fatal shooting on the set of his film ""Rust,"" suggesting that those suing are only after money. Multiple lawsuits have been filed, including by the family of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was shot and killed last October when a prop gun wielded by Baldwin went off. Brian Panish, a lawyer for the victim's husband of 16 years and the couple's 9-year-old son Andros, has accused Baldwin and the film's producers of ""major breaches of industry protocols"" that ""led to the senseless and tragic death of Halyna Hutchins."" But at Boulder International Film Festival on Saturday, Baldwin said those who have filed lawsuits are targeting ""people that they think are deep pocket litigants"" instead of suing people responsible for the misfire. ""Their attitude is 'Oh, the people who likely seem negligent have no money, and the people who have money are not negligent. But we're not going to let that stop us from doing what we need to do in terms of litigation,' "" the actor said in a video of his festival appearance published by CNN on Sunday. ""Why sue people if you're not going to get money? That's what you're doing it for."" Baldwin also deflected blame for the incident, insisting he was following appropriate safety protocol and that responsibility lies with those in charge of checking the prop gun before handing it to him. Director Joel Souza, who was also shot and injured in the incident, told investigators that guns on the set were checked first by armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and again by assistant director David Halls, who would hand the firearms to the actor using them. ""All my career, without incident, I've relied on the safety experts there to declare the gun is safe and hand me the gun,"" Baldwin said. ""Never had a problem. And this happened, and, of course, to me, sometimes it's so surreal I don't even know what to say."" 'I just felt so angry': Halyna Hutchins' husband wanted Alec Baldwin to accept responsibility But Baldwin also noted he's received support following the incident, saying that the ""overwhelming majority"" of people he's encountered have ""been very kind."" He also remembered Hutchins as a ""lovely woman"" and talented cinematographer. Baldwin added that he expects the entertainment industry to change its safety protocols regarding weapons moving forward. ""I was involved in a situation where somebody was killed. It's changed my life, just in terms of the function of weapons in films and television,"" he said. ""They will probably in all likelihood eliminate nearly all live weapons ... and they'll CGI the explosion, and they'll lay in the sound."" Last month, Hutchins' husband Matthew sat down for an interview with the ""Today"" show, in which he reacted to Baldwin saying he doesn't feel guilt over the shooting. ""The idea that the person holding the gun, causing it to discharge, is not responsible is absurd to me,"" Hutchins said in the interview. ""But gun safety was not the only problem on that set. There were a number of industry standards that were not practiced and there’s multiple responsible parties.""

3/9/2022,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A ""troubling new strategic convergence"" between Beijing and Moscow has developed and the risk of ""major power conflict"" had grown since Russia invaded Ukraine, Australia's intelligence chief said on Wednesday. Andrew Shearer, director general of the Office of National Intelligence, said China's President Xi Jinping appears to be planning to dominate the Indo-Pacific region and use it as a base to overtake the United States as the world's leading power. The comments reinforce warnings that the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has met near-universal condemnation by the West, may spread into a regional or global conflict. This week Australian Prime Minister called on liberal democracies to stop an ""arc of autocracy"" reshaping the world. ""We're going to have to work much harder to maintain the liberal quality of the rules-based order in Europe and here in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Shearer said at a conference hosted by the Australian Financial Review. ""We see a leader who's really battening down and hardening his country for this struggle to overtake the United States as the world's leading power,"" he added, referring to Xi. ""The base camp ... is to establish primacy in the Indo-Pacific region."" Shearer said the geopolitical threat would centre around technology, including use of cyber attacks, so Australia must bolster its cyber defences without closing itself to trade and information-sharing. ""We need a growing, open economy so we can fund the increases in defence spending that the government's committed to, but this can't be a zero sum trade-off between economics and security,"" he said. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it has called a ""special operation"", Australian intelligence professionals considered that ""a major power conflict unfortunately is becoming a less remote prospect than it was previously"", Shearer said. He echoed many Western commentators by saying he was surprised by the effectiveness of Ukraine's resistance to Russian forces. But he foreshadowed a ""brutal, bloody couple of weeks"" since Russian leader Vladimir Putin had ""everything at stake now (and) it's hard to see an elegant, or inelegant, dismount"". The Kremlin describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.

3/9/2022,"A south Florida teacher was taken to the hospital last week after she was attacked by a 5-year-old student, leaving her ""dazed"" and ""unresponsive,"" officials said Monday. The unidentified instructor was found by first responders “sitting on the ground against the wall"" and ""appearing to be in a faint state"" at Pines Lakes Elementary School, about 15 miles southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale, according to a heavily redacted Pembroke Pines Police Department incident report. The victim was ""clearly weak and dazed,"" able to ""blink and breathe regularly but at no point was able to vocally respond or show signs of a response,"" the report said. The troubling incident started when a 5-year-old boy had to be removed from class for “throwing things around” and “flipping the chairs,” police said. The youngster was taken to an empty “cool down” room, where the attack on the teacher allegedly took place, police said. The teacher was taken to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and has since been released, officials said. Video: Teacher banned from school property after caught slapping student An Indiana teacher has been banned from school property after security footage shows the teacher slapping a young student in the face. The school board granted the teacher an early retirement, and police are looking into the incident. While the young suspect is still being investigated for possible ""aggravated assault with hands, fist and feet,"" it's unlikely he'll be criminally prosecuted, a police spokesman told NBC News on Monday. Prosecutors would be hard pressed to show that this 5-year-old had the ability distinguish right from wrong, the police representative said. The victim, in her late 30s or early 40s, is about 5-foot-4 with a slender frame, Broward Teachers Union President Anna Fusco told NBC News on Monday. She suffered a concussion and other injuries after the ""enraged"" special education student, between 50 and 60 pounds, unleashed on the teacher, according to the union chief. The instructor had been leading an ""exceptional student education"" class with a ""group of children with some type of special needs or special disability, with all kinds of different diagnoses,"" according to Fusco.  ""The way he pounced on her and the way she fell backwards and smacked her head, it was a severe concussion,"" Fusco said. ""She's got some other bodily injuries from him jumping on her, attacking her, kicking, punching, biting that's going to lead to surgery."" Broward County Public Schools officials referred all questions to police. The district, though, did share a message that Principal Susan Sasse sent to parents and staff, acknowledging there had been ""an incident that occurred in school"" which required ""a staff member to be transported to a local medical facility"" on Wednesday. ""At all times during the incident, our campus was secured,"" Sasse reported. ""As always, the health, safety and well being of our students and staff continues to be my highest priority."" The school has nearly 800 students, who range in age from pre-kindergarten through the fifth grade.  ",U.S./NBC News,"Florida teacher beaten and hospitalized after attack by 5-year-old student, police say",https://news.yahoo.com/florida-teacher-beaten-hospitalized-attack-162747938.html
