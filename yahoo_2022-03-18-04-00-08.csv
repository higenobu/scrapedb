Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce The teen was arrested Tuesday on hate crime and battery charges. From AP News: “I’m very pleased that the school took a front stand on this,” Terrebonne Parish Sheriff Tim Soignet said in a news release. “When we received the complaint, we immediately put our detectives on it. They worked through the weekend so we could get to this point,” Soignet said. “My officers did a good job handling it and working with the school to get this case to where it is now.” Vandebilt Catholic President Jeremy Gueldner said the school does not tolerate bullying or racism. These “actions by a few are not consistent with the values and mission of our school,” the archdiocese statement said. Well it’s a given that tolerating racism isn’t written in the fine print of a school’s mission. However, this is the third incident, nationally, in the past two weeks where a student has experienced a racially motivated attack. Terrebone Parish NAACP President Jerome Boykin acknowledged how quickly the school and sheriff responded and said he hopes the teen can “learn from his mistake,” per AP News. The family of the victim also responded in a statement. “We will continue to pray for our school community as a whole, that we not only get through this together but that we each learn a valuable lesson from what has taken place,” they said, per AP News.",U.S./The Root,Louisiana Student Charged with Hate Crime for Whipping Black Classmate,https://news.yahoo.com/louisiana-student-charged-hate-crime-162058932.html
3/18/2022,"Russian government websites and state media are facing an ""unprecedented"" level of hacking attempts, the Washington Post reported. Why it matters: Since the start of its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Russia has passed a new ""fake news"" law and blocked social media networks like Facebook in order to clamp down on the ability of regular Russians to get unfiltered information about the war. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. State of play: ""We are recording unprecedented attacks on the websites of government authorities,"" Russia's Ministry of Digital Development and Communications said in a statement Thursday, per the Post. The hacking attacks have also been significantly more powerful than similar ones in the past. ""If their capacity at peak times reached 500 GB earlier, it is now up to 1 TB. That is, two to three times more powerful than the most serious incidents of this type previously recorded,"" the statement added. As a result, Russian regulators have begun filtering traffic coming from abroad. The statement did not elaborate on what specific measures had been taken, the Post reported. The big picture: In a hack that occurred Wednesday, the perpetrators targeted the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry's website. They replaced the department's hotline with a number for Russian soldiers to use if they want to defect from the army called ""Come back from Ukraine alive,"" according to the Post. Hackers also altered the top news items on the ministry's home page to: ""Don’t believe Russian media — they lie"" and ""Default in Russia is near."" They also added a link that offers ""full information about the war in Ukraine,"" per the Post. Like this article?

3/18/2022,"Musk challenged Putin to one-on-one combat over Ukraine, which Russia invaded on February 24. A Chechen leader purportedly argued on Telegram that the Russian president would wreck Musk. ""If he is afraid to fight, I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left-handed,"" Musk said. Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, doubled down on his challenge to fight Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he'd fight the Russian dictator with his left hand. Musk tweeted in response to an apparent post from the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov, a Putin loyalist, posted a long Telegram post in which he insulted Musk by calling him ""Elona"" and argued that the Russian president would beat ""the hell"" out of Musk. ""So you need to go to the gym and get stronger, to turn yourself from a tender Elona into a brutal Elon,"" he said. (Musk then changed his Twitter display name to ""Elona Musk."") The Chechen leader also mockingly suggested three places for Musk to train in Chechnya, including the Russian University of the Spetsnaz, a special-forces training school; Akhmat Martial Arts School; and the Chechen State Broadcasting Company. ""Elon Musk, I suggest you do not challenge Putin. You're in two completely different weight classes,"" Kadyrov wrote. Musk declined the offer for additional training, saying it would give him ""too much of an advantage."" ""If he is afraid to fight, I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left-handed,"" he tweeted, signing his tweet with his newly given nickname ""Elona."" Musk's original tweet challenging Putin was posted on Monday and written in both English and Cyrillic script: ""I hereby challenge Vladimir Putin to single combat. Stakes are Ukraine."" Russia invaded its neighboring country of Ukraine on February 24. As of March 14, the war has resulted in at least 600 deaths, though the actual number is likely much higher, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Since the war started, Musk has activated satellite-internet service in Ukraine through Starlink systems, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked him for. SpaceX, Musk's aerospace company, also heckled the head of Russia's space agency Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, during the Starlink system launch. ""Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom,"" SpaceX's launch director said on a live stream, referencing one of Rogozin's remarks.
