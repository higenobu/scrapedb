3/19/2022,"A tiny, majority-Black town in Tennessee which was poised to benefit from a massive investment from Ford Motor Company has instead been taken over by the state’s comptroller.

Mason, Tenn., has about 1,500 residents. Most of its elected officials are Black and members of the Democratic party, in stark contrast with the mostly-white and Republican-controlled Tipton County government as well as Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower, who on Tuesday took the step of seizing control of Mason’s finances.

Mumpower’s power grab comes after he’d given Mason’s government a choice between relinquishing its charter–essentially giving away control of the town to Tipton County–or having him step in and assume control of the municipality’s budget and spending powers. According to Tennessee Lookout, a local government watchdog website, Mumpower says the move was necessary to address financial mismanagement in Mason.

But the city’s elected officials aren’t so sure about that.
 From Tennessee Lookout: Mason officials have pushed back on Mumpower’s assessment. The town ended up in a half-million-dollar financial hole caused in large part by fraud and embezzlement during prior administrations, Rivers said. Rivers said she and other officials have been working hard to pay off debts accrued under those previous administrations. Rivers and other town officials have questioned why Mumpower or other state officials did not intervene before now. Mason, which still serves as home to descendants of freed slaves, was led by White officials for more than a century. The town’s first Black Mayor, Gwen Kilpatrick, assumed office in 2015 after allegations of fraud and mismanagement led to the resignations of nearly all City Hall officials, who were White. Mason residents have elected Black leaders ever since. Mason’s current mayor, vice mayor and five of its six aldermen are Black. Automotive giant Ford is planning to invest a reported $5.6 billion in a massive new electric vehicle and battery facility dubbed Blue Oval City, which will sit just four miles from Mason. According to the Tennessee Lookout story, the main highway between Memphis and Blue Oval City, as well as a rail line and other critical infrastructure run right through Mason.

That puts Mason likely on the cusp of a huge windfall in tax and development revenues, none of which its elected mayor or city council will control with Mumpower in charge.

The situation recalls other incidents of white officials moving to take control of municipal spending from Black ones.

In 2018, the public development authority in Duquesne, Pa., transferred $1.3 million from the city’s development funds to a private nonprofit entity controlled by an all-white board that included former city officials, just before the city’s first Black woman mayor, Nickole Nesby was sworn into office. Duquesne, a Pittsburgh suburb, sued to get the money back and its city council agreed to a settlement that allowed the money to stay with the private group while having the city appoint someone to its board of directors. Nesby opposed the deal.

3/19/2022,"""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely stalled on all fronts,"" Britain's Ministry of Defense said in a public intelligence assessment early Thursday. ""Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea, or air in recent days and they continue to suffer heavy losses. Ukrainian resistance remains staunch and well-coordinated. The vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands."" One Ukrainian town, Voznesensk, is still in Ukraine's hands because Ukrainian soldiers and local volunteers repelled a Russian attempt to capture it, in ""one of the most comprehensive routs President Vladimir Putin's forces have suffered since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine,"" The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, based on reporting in the strategically located southern town of 35,000. ""Judging from the destroyed and abandoned armor,"" the Ukrainians ""eliminated most of a Russian battalion tactical group on March 2 and 3,"" killing an estimated 100 Russians and capturing or destroying 30 of 43 Russian tanks and other vehicles, the Journal reports. ""The Ukrainian defenders' performance against a much-better-armed enemy in an overwhelmingly Russian-speaking region was successful in part because of widespread popular support for the Ukrainian cause — one reason the Russian invasion across the country has failed to achieve its principal goals so far.""

3/19/2022,"Tatiana Perebeinis and her two children were killed earlier this month in Ukraine. Perebeinis worked at tech startup SE Ranking, which makes search engine optimization tools. Her death, captured in a New York Times photo, brought home the war's brutalities for her colleagues and Silicon Valley peers. As soon as Ksenia Khirvonina saw the photo, she recognized her friend's jacket. Just a few days earlier, as Khirvonina and her internet company coworkers gathered in the mountains for a corporate retreat, her colleague Tatiana Perebeinis had worn the same light pink parka. Now, Perebeinis, 43, and her two children were dead, killed by Russian shelling as they tried to escape to safety. A photo of their deaths was published by The New York Times. Russian mortars struck an evacuation route for Ukrainian civilians, killing Perebeinis, her 18-year-old son Mykyta, and her 9-year-old daughter, Alisa, and fatally wounding Anatoly Berezhnyi, a volunteer who was helping them flee. The family had been sheltering in the basement of their apartment building for days and was attempting to escape as Russian soldiers repeatedly shelled their neighborhood. They never made it. The image of the family, felled in the middle of the street with their luggage strewn around them, instantly became a symbol of the horror taking place in Ukraine. At least 691 Ukrainian civilians have been killed as of March 15, according to the United Nations, but The New York Times estimated Thursday that figure could be much higher, possibly in the thousands. On Friday, in the western city of Lyiv, 109 empty strollers and car seats were placed in front of the city hall to memorialize the children that have died in the conflict. As details about Perebeinis' life and her tech startup job emerged in the days after her death, the tragedy has struck a visceral nerve in many people, adding an overtone both relatable and unsettling to the grim photograph. The woman lying by the sidewalk was not an anonymous victim in a distant, war-torn land; she worked at a startup that looks remarkably similar to tech firms everywhere, with the same work meetings, office routines and corporate retreats familiar to all startup employees. ""She deserves so much more than to be known as the body in the street, killed by Putin's mortars,"" Twitter employee Brian Ries wrote in a tweet. Others on social media decried the loss of a ""fellow tech worker,"" who belonged to a company whose digital marketing tools ""we use every day."" Perebeinis was the head accountant at SE Ranking, a 9-year-old startup whose search engine optimization tools help websites manage their presence and rankings within online search results. For the past six years, Perebeinis had worked at its Kyiv office, delighting her colleagues with her adventurous spirit, sense of humor, and updates about her children's latest achievements. Her story over those years reflects both the chaos and uncertainty that has riven Ukraine since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, and the extent to which the forces of globalized internet commerce can provide a veneer of normalcy even amid the most turbulent times. Alex Iskold, a Ukrainian-born venture capital investor in New York, told Insider that his inbox is full of messages from startup founders in Ukraine and venture capitalists with ties to the country. The tech community in the US and Europe has responded to the invasion with ""a truly unprecedented display of unity and solidarity."" While he didn't know Perebeinis, Iskold called her death ""so graphic, so senseless, so hurtful."" ""There are moments in this war that drive things home even harder and this was one of them,"" he said of Perebeinis and her family's death. For those who worked alongside Perebeinis, the suddenness of her death was jarring. ""Tania was a new friend and colleague with whom I collaborated regularly and as recently as last Friday,"" said Scott Irwin, cofounder of San Francisco-based financial firm Camber Partners, in a Linkedin post. ""This has been heart-breaking but also evil and unjust."" Irwin's firm invested in SE Ranking late last year. Camber Partners hasn't revealed the amount it invested, and Irwin did not respond to Insider's outreach, though he told TechCrunch in December that Camber's typical investment is between $10 million and $25 million. The Camber Partners investment appears to have been SE Ranking's most significant direct link to Silicon Valley. While Perebeinis has been described in some media reports as an employee of a Palo Alto, California, tech company, SE Ranking's operations are primarily in Eastern Europe, with nearly all of its roughly 100 employees based in Kyiv or Minsk, Belarus, according to their LinkedIn profiles. SE Ranking lists a Palo Alto address on its website, as well as headquarters in London, but the main London address is a mail forwarding address and the office building in Palo Alto had no listing for SE Ranking in its directory. Khirvonina, who is SE Ranking's head of public relations, said the company has investors and partners based in the US, but said she could not disclose their names. Soon after joining SE Ranking in 2016, Perebeinis rose through the ranks to eventually oversee all of the company's finances, both in Ukraine and internationally, effectively taking on the role of chief financial officer. She and her husband, Serhiy, had moved to Kyiv in 2014 after fleeing an uprising by Russian separatists in Donetsk, a city in eastern Ukraine. In 2018, they bought an apartment in Irpin, a community just outside Kyiv — they hoped the apartment would feel like ""a fortress, their home for many years to come,"" Khirvonina said. Khirvonina described Perebeinis as bright, always smiling, almost always in a good mood, and always willing to help out her colleagues, even with their personal finances: Perebeinis had recently helped Khirvonina upgrade her credit card, explaining how to call her bank and how to fill out the paperwork. ""She was a big sister to a lot of us,"" Khirvonina said. When Perebeinis' son Mykyta was applying to colleges, the whole office became invested in the process, offering advice on his exams and which university he should attend. In the build-up to Russia's February invasion of Ukraine, many of SE Ranking's employees in Europe fled to other countries such as Poland and the UAE. Perebeinis had delayed leaving however, and was still in Irpin as Russian tanks rolled down the street, according to Khirvonina, who spoke to Insider from Dubai. Perebeinis had stayed back because she was concerned about her mother, who The New York Times reports has Alzheimer's disease, and because she didn't want to leave her son — at 18, he was required to stay in Ukraine for possible military conscription. Anastasia Avetysian, another SE Ranking employee, told The Times that Perebeinis had been instrumental in distributing emergency funds to employees to help them evacuate, and that her sense of humor was intact even as she hid in her building's basement. ""She was optimistic and joking in our group chat that the company would now need to do a special operation to get them out, like 'Saving Private Ryan,'"" Avetysian told The Times. SE Ranking had been tracking employees' locations and evacuation plans on a spreadsheet and was aware that Perebeinis and her children were hoping, finally, to flee on March 6. On that day, a Sunday, Khirvonina was monitoring an employee channel on the messaging app Telegram when she saw that Russian soldiers were firing on the same evacuation corridor Perebeinis planned to use. ""My heart squeezed,"" she said. ""I was praying that it was not them."" The company's HR manager called Perebeinis repeatedly but she didn't pick up. Eventually, she confirmed that Perebeinis, Mykyta, and Alisa had been killed. Soon after, the photos appeared online. ""She was an innocent person, she did nothing wrong. She was not carrying any weapons. She was not saying any bad words to those Russian soldiers, nothing,"" Khirvonina said. ""She was just running to the bus."" In the nearly two weeks since Perebeinis and her family were killed, Russia's attacks on cities in Ukraine have intensified, with reports of Russian forces shelling civilian areas in Kyiv and other cities. Iskold, the founder and managing partner of 2048 Ventures, recently launched a fund called the $1K Project, which is giving money directly to families impacted by the war. ""These are war crimes, these are atrocities, baseless and senseless killing of people of the country where I was born. This needs to stop,"" said Iskold, who lived in Ukraine until he was 19. Employees and executives at tech companies including Meta, Uber, and Apple, many with direct ties to the country, have sprung to action. Grammarly, a San Francisco software startup that was founded in Ukraine, said it is donating $5 million for organizations supporting people in Ukraine, while employees have shared photos of friends' and family members' homes in ruins. Lyft, the ride-hailing app, which reportedly has nearly 60 employees in Ukraine, told Insider it's providing financial support and extra time off for those who want to temporarily relocate. For SE Ranking's Khirvonina, the loss of her colleague is part of a much larger tragedy affecting Ukraine, but one that is still difficult to process. ""It was very hard because it's a person you knew and a person you just talked to several days ago,"" Khirvonina said. ""What could have happened if they were, I don't know, 10 meters away from that spot, or if they were not running so fast, or if they were taking some other side of the street? Maybe it could be avoided."" With additional reporting by Shona Ghosh. Read the original article on Business Insider",World/INSIDER,The photo of a dead Ukrainian woman and her kids shocked the world.

3/19/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The signs are abundant of how Ukraine frustrated Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a swift victory, and how Russia's military proved far from ready for the fight. A truck carrying Russian troops crashes, its doors blown open by a rocket-propelled grenade. Foreign-supplied drones target Russian command posts. Orthodox priests in trailing vestments parade Ukraine’s blue and yellow flag in defiance of their Russian captors in the occupied city of Berdyansk. Russia has lost hundreds of tanks, many left charred or abandoned along the roads, and its death toll is on a pace to outstrip that of the country’s previous military campaigns. Yet more than three weeks into the war, with Putin's initial aim of an easy regime change in Ukraine long gone, Russia’s military still has a strong hand. With their greater might and stockpile of city-flattening munitions, Russian forces can fight on for whatever the Russian president may plan next, whether leveraging a negotiated settlement or brute destruction, military analysts warn. Despite all the determination of Ukraine’s people, all the losses among Russia’s forces, and all the errors of Russia’s leaders, there is no sign that the war will soon be over. Even if he fails to take control of the country, Putin can keep up the punishing attacks on its cities and people. “His instinct will be always to double down, because he’s got himself into a dreadful mess, a huge strategic blunder,” said Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank. “And I don’t think it’s in his character to try to retrieve that, except by carrying on, going forward,” he said. Putin’s forces in Ukraine are waging Russia’s largest, most complex combined military campaign since taking Berlin in 1945. His initial objective, which he announced in a television address on Feb. 24 as the invasion began, was to “demilitarize” Ukraine and save its people from “neo-Nazis,"" a false description of Ukraine’s government, which is led by a Jewish president. Fatefully, Putin underestimated the national pride and battlefield skills that Ukrainians have built up over the past eight years of battling Russian-backed separatists in the country's east. At the start, Russians thought “they would install, you know, some pro-Russian government and call it a day and declare victory,” said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia’s security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. “That was sort of Plan A, and as near as we can tell, they didn’t really have a Plan B.” Russia’s first apparent plan — attack key Ukrainian military targets, and make a quick run to Kyiv — failed immediately. It was foiled by Ukraine’s defenses along with the countless mistakes and organizational failures by a Russian force that had been told it was only mobilized for military drills. Clarke, the British researcher, related accounts of Russian troops selling communication equipment and fuel out of military vehicles to locals during the weeks they waited on Ukraine’s borders. With no friendly population to welcome them, Russian forces reverted to tactics from their past offensives in Syria and Chechnya — dropping bombs and lobbing missiles into cities and town, sending millions of men, women and children fleeing. Putin’s forces are in position to capture the besieged port city of Mariupol. Overall, Russians appear to be fighting with three objectives now: to surround Kyiv, to encircle spread-out Ukrainian fighters in the east, and to break through to the major port city of Odessa in the west, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military and program director at CNA. Kofman cautions that much of the information on the war is coming from Ukrainians, or their American or other allies. That makes the partial picture skewed, and a full picture impossible. A senior U.S. defense official on Friday said the Russians have launched more than 1,080 missiles since the start of the war as they remain largely stalled across the country. The official said they retain about 90% of the combat power they had arrayed around Ukraine at the start of the war. The U.S. assesses that the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military assessments. The Ukrainian air force is continuing to fly aircraft and employ air and missile defense “Just look at the map, and you just look at how little progress the Russians have been able to make,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said recently. The math of military conquests and occupation may be against Putin in Ukraine. Estimates of Russian deaths vary widely. Yet even conservative figures are in the low thousands. That's a much faster pace than in previous Russian offensives, threatening support for the war among ordinary Russians. Russia had 64 deaths in five days of fighting during its 2008 war with Georgia. It lost about 15,000 in Afghanistan over 10 years, and more than 11,000 over years of fighting in Chechnya. Russia’s number of dead and wounded in Ukraine is nearing the 10% benchmark of diminished combat effectiveness, Gorenburg said. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals — out of an estimated 20 in the fight — signal impaired command, he said. Researchers tracking only those Russian equipment losses that were photographed or recorded on video say Russia has lost more than 1,500 tanks, trucks, mounted equipment and other heavy gear. Two out of three of those were captured or abandoned, signaling the failings of the Russian troops that let them go. Meanwhile, Russia needs to limit its use of smart, long-range missiles in case they’re needed in any larger war with NATO, military analysts say. When it comes to the grinding job of capturing and holding cities, conventional military metrics suggest Russia needs a 5-to-1 advantage in urban fighting, analysts say. Meanwhile, the formula for ruling a restive territory in the face of armed opposition is 20 fighters for every 1,000 people — or 800,000 Russian troops for Ukraine’s more than 40 million people, Clarke notes. That's almost as many as Russia's entire active-duty military of 900,000. On the ground, that means controlling any substantial chunk of Ukrainian territory long-term would take more resources than Russia could foreseeably commit. Other Russian options remain possible, including a negotiated settlement. Moscow is demanding that Ukraine formally embrace neutrality, thus swearing off any alliance with NATO, and recognize the independence of the separatist regions in the east and Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Russia's other options include an unrelenting air campaign in which it bombs and depopulates cities as it did in Chechnya and Syria. U.S. officials also warn of the risk of Russian chemical attacks, and the threat of escalation to nuclear war. “Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal — they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will will rise up against Russian occupation — there will be just constant guerrilla war"" if Russian troops remain, Clarke said. —— Associated Press writer Lolita C.
