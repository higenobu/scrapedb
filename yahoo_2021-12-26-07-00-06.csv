12/26/2021,"DALLAS (AP) — The wife of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was arrested Christmas Eve on a domestic violence charge that the right-wing provocateur said stems from a ""medication imbalance.” Sheriff's deputies took Erika Wulff Jones into custody and booked her into an Austin jail around 8:45 p.m. Friday. Jail records show the 43-year-old faces misdemeanor charges of assault causing bodily injury to a family member and resisting arrest, search or transport. She had not received a bond Saturday afternoon. Alex Jones, an Austin resident and founder of the right-wing media group Infowars, declined Saturday to say whether he'd been injured or elaborate on what happened beyond that he believes it was related to his wife's recent change of medication. “It’s a private family matter that happened on Christmas Eve,"" Jones told The Associated Press in a brief interview. ""I love my wife and care about her and it appears to be some kind of medication imbalance.” Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was found liable Monday for damages in lawsuits relating to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In the past, Jones has claimed that the massacre was a hoax. The Travis County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to a request Christmas Day for the report on Wulff Jones’ arrest and a spokeswoman said she could not provide more information. An attorney for Wulff Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Jones sued this week seeking to block subpoenas he'd been issued by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Jones spoke at a rally in support of then-President Donald Trump that proceeded the riot and his Infowars colleague, Owen Shroyer, was charged with crimes related to it in August. Shroyer has said he's “innocent of the charges.” Jones said his wife's arrest “doesn't concern my politics” and that “it wasn’t some kind of personal hateful thing or anything.”",U.S./Associated Press,Alex Jones' wife arrested on domestic violence charge,https://news.yahoo.com/alex-jones-wife-arrested-domestic-204930217.html
12/26/2021,"“Don’t do it,” the mother of suspected gunman Ethan Crumbley texted him on the day of the deadly attack, but she wasn’t referring to his imminent assault on a Michigan high school. Instead, attorneys for Jennifer and Jason Crumbley said, she was telling him not to commit suicide. Jennifer Crumbley’s lackluster appeal to her son was a symptom of a larger pattern of alleged parental neglect disclosed by prosecutors this week in the couple’s ongoing trial. In court documents filed Thursday, prosecutors alleged the Crumbleys ignored “troubling” red flags from their son, including instances of animal torture and disturbing, bloody sketches. Instead, they spent hours with their cherished horses and—in Jennifer’s case—doggedly pursued an extramarital affair. “The defendants had information long before Nov. 30 (six months prior to the shooting) that their son’s only friend moved at the end of October, that the family dog died, that their son was sadder than usual, and that he was sending his mother disturbing texts about his state of mind,” one filing said, according to the Detroit Free Press. “Instead of paying attention to their son and getting him help, they bought him a gun.” Now, the Crumbley parents are staring down charges of four counts of involuntary manslaughter in a case “unprecedented” in the state, according to former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. They face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Their son, Ethan Crumbley, has been charged with 24 felonies, including four counts of murder and one count of terrorism. He had pleaded not guilty to all charges, and will be tried as an adult. If convicted, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Watch: Oxford High School shooting: Prosecutors detail Ethan Crumbley's mental state, claim parents failed to help A new court filing shares details about the mindset of alleged Oxford High School shooter, as well as information about his parents. The Crumbleys “knew their son was depressed, that he was fascinated with guns… that he had been researching ammunition while at a school and that he was seen watching violent videos of shootings that morning,” according to prosecutors, but they purchased the gun for Ethan as an early Christmas present anyway, leaving it in an unlocked armoire. On Nov. 30, Ethan Crumbley allegedly took the Sig Sauer 9mm to Oxford High School. The subsequent mass shooting he is accused of committing ended in the deaths of four students: Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Justin Shilling, 17. Six other students and a 47-year-old teacher were wounded, according to authorities. The Crumbleys were present at the high school on the morning of the shooting, called in after a teacher spotted Ethan’s “concerning drawings and written statements,” including phrases like: “the thoughts won’t stop. Help me,” “bloody everywhere,” and “my life is useless.” Asked to take their son home for the day, the Crumbleys reportedly refused and left, according to a letter by the Oxford Community Schools Superintendent. But there had been other warning signs, too. Watch: Prosecutors release more details, evidence about Oxford High School shooting Oakland County prosecutors released more details about the Crumbley family after lawyers for the parents of accused Oxford High School shooter Ethan Crumbley requested a lower bond. In her Thursday filing, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald outlined how Ethan Crumbley “was torturing animals (and) even kept a baby bird's head in a jar on his bedroom floor, which he later took and placed in a school bathroom.” But, she continued, “the parents were focusing on their own issues, things like extramarital affairs, financial issues and substance abuse.” The couple also spent up to three hours a night, three or four times a week, caring for their horses at a nearby barn, McDonald wrote. The prosecutor also noted in her filing that Jennifer Crumbley had told her boyfriend on the day of the shooting that the alleged murder weapon had been in her car. After news of the Oxford shooting broke, and Crumbley texted her son, “Don’t do it,” it was previously reported, James Crumbley called 911 to report the gun was missing and that his son might be the suspected gunman. The prosecutor made the shocking disclosures in a response to the defense’s request that Jennifer and Jason Crumbley be granted a lower bond of $100,000 cash, down from the current $500,000. The couple’s lawyers argued the pair posed no flight risk or danger to the public. The day-long manhunt that ended in the Crumbleys being cornered by law enforcement in an artist’s studio on Dec. 4 had not been the result of an attempt to flee, the defense said, adding that the parents had planned to turn themselves in later that day. The Crumbley team’s request, made Wednesday, also revealed the alleged true origins of Jennifer Crumbley’s “Don’t do it” text, the Free Press reported. “When Mrs. Crumbley texted Ethan, ‘Don’t do it,’… the shootings had already happened, Mr. Crumbley had determined the gun was missing and had notified authorities, and Mrs. Crumbley was texting her son to tell him not to kill himself,” the defense wrote, stating later that the “devastated” Crumbleys “did not know Ethan was a threat to anyone; and they certainly did not anticipate or cause the tragedy that unfolded at Oxford High School.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

12/26/2021,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Western countries should have a united front against China to prevent the Asian state from using commercial interests to play them against each other, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an interview aired on Saturday. Trudeau said China has been ""playing"" Western countries against one another as they compete for access to economic opportunities in the country. ""We've been competing and China has been, from time to time, very cleverly playing us off each other in an open market, competitive way,"" he said in an interview with Global television. ""We need to do a better job of working together and standing strong so China can't play the angles and divide us one against the other."" Relations between Canada and China have been chilly since the 2018 detention of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant. China detained two Canadians shortly afterwards, denying Ottawa's accusations of hostage diplomacy. Meng reached a deal with U.S. prosecutors in September, ending the extradition fight, and the two Canadians were released within hours of the agreement. Even before Meng's arrest, Canada's repeated questioning of China's human rights positions had irked Beijing, and the two countries have failed to come closer. Earlier this month, Canada said it will join allies in a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in February to send China a message over its human rights record.

12/26/2021,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious Normally we don’t cover boats on Motorious since we’re all about collector cars, both of the classic and modern variety. However, when we ran across this 2,700-horsepower ZR48 Corvette Boat we had to make an exception. It’s long, sleek, and probably what Batman would use on the open water, especially considering as you’ll see in the video it can get away from the police with ease. Check out an old truck converted into a racing boat here. In the included video, the owner of this boat is hot dogging around until apparently the US Coast Guard decides he’s being reckless. They give chase as he hits it, the Corvette Boat speeding off and easily gapping them by an embarrassing distance. The secret to the amazing performance of this ZR48 Corvette Boat is the twin Mercury Racing Twin Turbo Marine Engines it houses. Each one of those engines produces 1,350-hp, which alone would be amazing. However, when you put them together they can really make a boat move. Helping further is the fact this Corvette Boat doesn’t weigh much. The hull is made of carbon fiber, a material known for its lightweight nature but which can also be incredibly strong. With how this vessel moves on the water, it likely needs all the rigidity it can get. As if that’s not cool enough, the boat apparently has quite the interior. There’s an 8,00-watt stereo system onboard for partying on the open waters, air conditioning, TV screen with Apple TV connection, and even a mobile WiFi hotspot so you can stream whatever you want. Some people say this Corvette Boat looks like it’s inspired by Darth Vader. We can kind of see that in the front of the cockpit. However, the tail end definitely is a callout to the ‘Vette with 4 round taillights and the crossed flags badge. Check out the video but beware, it’s super shaky so that’s pretty annoying (Warning: language). Sign up for the Motorious Newsletter.

12/26/2021,"The former head volleyball coach for Green Mountain Garwin School District has been charged with four counts of sexual exploitation by a school employee and one count of dissemination and exhibition of obscene materials to minors. Brycelyn Haughey, 22, of the Tama County town of Toledo, who also was a paraeducator for the district, is accused of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old boy from September to December 2020. She could not be reached for comment Saturday, nor could her attorney. Tama County sheriff's Detective Trevor Killian, in an affidavit filed Dec. 21 in county District Court, said Superintendent Kym Stein contacted him in October and told him about the situation, setting off an investigation. Stein became the district's superintendent July 1. Killian said in the affidavit that she told him the school district's previous administration had overlooked the situation ""and she felt as a mandatory reporter, this was pertinent to the investigation."" The school district began investigating Haughey after she resigned from her position Sept. 23, according to the Sun-Courier newspaper in Reinbeck. Haughey is listed as a preschool and special education paraprofessional on the website for South Tama County Elementary School, but the Sun-Courier said Tama County School District officials confirmed she had resigned her position there on Dec. 15. Killian's affidavit said he met Dec. 1 with the student, who told him he and Haughey met and exchanged telephone numbers after he hit her vehicle while backing out of the school parking lot in September 2020. The student was supposed to fix Haughey's car, the affidavit said. ""[The student] stated that Brycelyn asked how old [he] was and he stated 17,"" it said. ""Brycelyn then asked if [the student] was a senior and [he] said 'No, I'm a junior.' [The student] stated that Brycelyn then made a comment of 'close enough.'"" More: Appellate court reverses ruling granting new sex abuse trial to former North Polk teacher After that, the student received flirtatious texts from Haughey and he ""just went with it cause he thought she was joking around,"" the affidavit said. It said the student told Killian that Haughey invited him to her home on Sept. 25, 2020, and that when he arrived there, she was with a girl younger than he was. More: Former Southeast Polk teacher who filmed sexual abuse of student sentenced to 24 years in prison The student said he began drinking alcohol with Haughey and the girl, and that later that night, he and Haughey engaged in their first sexual act, the affidavit said. It said he told Killian that he and Haughey continued to meet, drink and have sex, and that Haughey sent the him text messages with multiple ""seductive"" photos of herself, including one in which she was clearly nude. The relationship ended in December 2020, the affidavit said. More: Iowa Supreme Court says state has 'no duty' to end what sex offenders call 'silent mandatory minimum' prison terms It said another underage student told Killian in November that he had seen the images of Haughey. No trial date has been set for Haughey. Under Iowa law, sexual exploitation by a school employee is a Class D felony that, upon conviction, carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a maximum fine of $10,245.
