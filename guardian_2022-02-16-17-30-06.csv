2/16/2022,"A police officer has denied trying to help constable Zachary Rolfe, who is charged with murder, by answering “I don’t recall” multiple times during his evidence at trial. Constable James Kirstenfeldt continued his evidence on Wednesday in Rolfe’s murder trial.  Rolfe, 30, is charged with murdering Kumanjayi Walker while trying to arrest him in the remote community of Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs, on 9 November 2019. The court has previously heard Rolfe shot Walker three times during a struggle after Walker stabbed him with a pair of scissors. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty to murder and two alternate charges. Kirstenfeldt and Rolfe were in a team of four officers from the Immediate Response Team (IRT) who deployed from Alice Springs to Yuendumu on the day of the shooting. During his evidence on Tuesday, Kirstenfeldt said he had not seen an email from Sgt Julie Frost, the officer in charge of Yuendumu station, which was sent after they deployed and outlined an operational plan for the officers from Alice Springs. But on Wednesday Kirstenfeldt was asked by the crown prosecutor, Philip Strickland SC, about evidence he provided during an earlier court hearing and in interviews with police which Strickland suggested appeared to contradict that claim. During an interview with police on 21 November 2019, which Strickland played to the court, Kirstenfeldt said he did not see an email until he had got to Yuendumu. He then referred in the interview to Frost sending the plan and said it contained information similar to what the IRT, who were trained to conduct high-risk arrests, would normally do: “just intel gather and then snatch him up in the morning”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Strickland also took him to the transcript of an earlier court hearing on 2 September 2020, where Kirstenfeldt said Frost showed him an email when he went to Yuendumu, but that it was not the same email as the operational plan. Kirstenfeldt told Strickland he accepted that he was shown an email at Yuendumu, but that he could not recall being shown it, or its contents. Strickland then asked Kirstenfeldt if his evidence that he didn’t recall being given the email or what its contents were was “given to try and help Mr Rolfe?” “No, it’s because I don’t recall the exact content of that email,” Kirstenfeldt responded. “I know it wasn’t this email, because this one has photos of him on it, and that would have been handy to have.” Strickland has previously told the court that the case against Rolfe relied not only on his actions during the shooting, but the “context” and the “steps leading up” to it, including the plan. The court was also shown body-worn camera footage of Rolfe and Kirstenfeldt attending a house in Yuendumu shortly after being briefed by Frost. Kirstenfeldt is heard on the footage questioning a boy at house about where Walker could be, where he could be staying that night, who he had left the house with, and when he had left. Speaking to the boy through a window, he is told Walker left only minutes earlier with his partner, Rickisha Robertson, and would be staying at the house that night. “If you see him before that, man, don’t tell him we were here, OK?” Kirstenfeldt says to the boy. “Otherwise he’s going to end up in too much trouble, we don’t want that, OK?” He is then overheard telling Rolfe he believed the kid was “genuine”, but when asked by Strickland if this meant he thought the boy was telling the truth, Kirstenfeldt responded “maybe”. He said he meant it more as a reference to the boy as “a good bloke”. Strickland asked why they had not used the information provided by the boy to plan an arrest of Walker at the house, given it seemed he would spend the night there. Instead, the court has heard, the officers acted on other information gathered at the property to attend other houses in Yuendumu, where Walker was located and killed during an attempted arrest only minutes later. “Single-source information from a child is probably not the most reliable to plan an operation on,” Kirstenfeldt responded. Later on Wednesday, the court heard from members of Walker’s family and the Robertson family, including Rickisha’s grandfather Eddie Robertson. Robertson, who the court heard had helped found Yuendumu and has worked with territory and federal governments and the police force as a representative of the community, said he understood Walker had planned to surrender after a funeral being held for a relative of Walker’s in the town. Robertson said that after an incident on 6 November 2019, when Walker threatened two Yuendumu police officers with an axe, he told him that he had to hand himself in after the funeral, and Walker – who the court has heard was quietly spoken – nodded in response. The funeral was held on the same day Walker was killed.

2/16/2022,"“The other day, the Wordle answer was MOUNT, which got me thinking – is Mason Mount the only footballer (present or former) whose first and second name are recognised five-letter words in the dictionary and therefore legitimate potential answers in Wordle?” asks Joe Hutton. Far be it from us wanting to publicise a rival’s game, but never let it be said we are not here to serve you, readers. To the best of our knowledge, Wordle works from a list of [spoiler alert] these 2,315 words, which scuppers a number of your suggestions – many of which are wholly valid dictionary suggestions (although it now also seems likely the NYT’s list is swiftly changing). Therefore, and deep breath …  “There’s the former England goalkeeper Frank Swift,” writes Chris Page, kicking us off with a strong one. “The former SFA chief executive Gordon Smith’s son Grant Smith at the likes of Swindon, Sheffield United and HJK Helsinki. The former Cambridge and Sheffield Wednesday stalwart Robin Hardy also qualifies. In the women’s game, I also came across the brilliantly named Northern Ireland Under-19 international Holly Otter.” Chai from Atlanta reports that, “despite common five-letter words like james, smith, green and brown being Wordle-approved, searching for footballers whose first and last names fit the bill wasn’t as easy as it seemed”. That hasn’t stopped Chai from pointing out multiple offerings of James Smith, James Brown (there are again a number of instances), James Hicks (and another), and the Arsenal and England legend Kelly Smith. Richard Hirst reveals the lengths that readers are having to go to: “Fulham’s Roger (yes, I sacrificed a go to make sure it qualified) Brown scored 12 goals, the most in a season by a Fulham defender, in 1981-82, including the goal in our final game against Lincoln which got us promotion to the then Division Two. Captain, leader, legend.” Wordle question - Cliff Birch, Cliff Baker, Cliff Hazel, Cliff Marsh, Cliff Mason. That's just the Cliffs. Has to be a few Smiths?

Note, we’re using the AA route planner. “Carlisle United have had a couple players on loan from Brighton, most recently Jeffrey Monakana in 2015,” adds Andrew Ferguson. “That’s 366.3 miles.” Plymouth Argyle are also a safe bet to feature somewhere in this answer and Tom Aldous is right on cue. “Last season Argyle loaned Kell Watts from Newcastle, some 408.6 miles if you were to drive it,” he mails. However, this is all small beer compared to elsewhere around the world. “Nicholas Sorras is currently on loan from Sydney Olympic to Perth Glory,” flags Tim Filippi. That’s the good stuff, just the 2,431.4 miles. Still, Gianfranco Facchineri’s 2020 loan from Vancouver Whitecaps to Atlético Ottawa was worth 2,708.1 miles (thanks, Noah Wheelock). But Russia trumps this, especially when SKA-Khabarovsk come to the table. “They currently play in Russia’s second tier and are on the far east side of the country,” notes Chris Page. “They’re around 2,500 miles from their nearest divisional rival, yet barely 600 or so miles away from North Korea. And they currently have a goalkeeper, Sergey Samok, on loan from PFC Sochi.

In the fourth round they faced Annan Athletic (League Two). The game went to extra-time and Clydebank were 3-2 up in the 119th minute. Sadly, too much for the legs and Annan came back with 119th- and 123rd-minute goals to turn it around. Great run though. Highlights here (Clydebank’s second well worth watching).” “Recently on Fifa, I managed to guide Real Zaragoza to a 2-1 home win against Barcelona with just nine men,” boasted Kevin Leonard back in 2016. “This got me wondering, what is the most red cards a team has ever had in a single game and still gone on to win?” In 2005 Grêmio, under the future Brazil coach Mano Menezes, won an astonishing promotion play-off against Nautico despite being reduced to seven [SEVEN – Knowledge vidiprinter] men when four of their players were sent off. The only goal was scored by future Manchester United midfielder Anderson, while Nautico missed two penalties. You can read more about it here. “Back in the 2016-17 season, Reading defeated Ipswich 2-1 at home,” writes John Smith. “I only remember this because all three goals arose from penalties. So, excluding the obvious example of goalless games that go to penalty shoot-outs, what’s the highest scoring match where every goal scored came from the penalty spot?” @TheKnowledge_GU at last night's Superbowl, there was a player on the field who was older than both head coaches (Andrew Whitworth, the Rams' 40-year-old offensive tackle).Has this ever happened in a professional football match, excluding player-managers? “In Newcastle’s recent win over Everton, Newcastle’s Jamaal Lascelles got the assist for an own goal by Mason Holgate, only to find his own net moments later from Holgate’s assist. Has this happened before?” wonders Jussi Kanner. @TheKnowledge_GU Barcelona's women's side, the league leaders, today played an away game at Real Sociedad, the second-placed side, and won 9-1. What is the record margin for a game between the two top sides in any league? “In a recent Serie A match, Juventus beat Verona 2-0 with both goals being scored by new signings and debutants, Dusan Vlahovic and Denis Zakaria,” notes Bogdan Kotarlic. “I suppose that there have been cases when more than two new signings have scored in their same first match for the new club?” “Chelsea’s Club World Cup final win over Palmeiras started a run of five games in five different competitions,” mails Barry Kitchin. “The next four fixtures are in the Premier League (Crystal Palace), Champions League (Lille), Carabao Cup (Liverpool) and FA Cup (Luton).

2/16/2022,"Simone Inzaghi made no pretences after his team were paired with Liverpool in December’s redraw for the Champions League last 16. “They were top of the list of teams I would have preferred to avoid,” said the Internazionale manager. “But we’ll try to arrive at that match in the best way possible.” It was striking to hear such a frank acknowledgement from a man whose ability to look on the bright side has been a defining characteristic of his tenure. Even to accept the Inter job last summer required optimism where his predecessor could find none. Antonio Conte left after steering the club to a first league title in 11 years, convinced that such success would be unsustainable.  Inter were embarking on a drastic cost-cutting exercise, after posting losses of more than €245m in their accounts for 2020-21. Inzaghi knew before accepting the job that Achraf Hakimi would be sold, but not that Romelu Lukaku would follow. The Belgian led the team in goals and assists last season. Hakimi scored seven times in Serie A and set up eight more from right wing-back. Supporters who had cheered the club president, Steven Zhang, during title celebrations hung banners outside the club’s headquarters demanding that he “take responsibility or leave our city”. Bookmakers installed Juventus, with Massimiliano Allegri back on the bench, as favourites to win Serie A. Inzaghi got on with making the most of what he had. Edin Dzeko was signed at his request, a 35-year-old free transfer from Roma to replace a striker sold for €115m. An inspired choice. Inzaghi shared Conte’s preference for a 3-5-2 – the system he had used at Lazio – but had ideas on how to use the shape differently, encouraging his team to hold the ball more and rely less on quick transitions. Where Lukaku had often been a bulldozer for Inter, clearing his way through opposing defences to score or apply the final pass, Dzeko plays more with his back to goal, bringing others into play. He found instant understanding with another free signing, Hakan Calhanoglu, only too happy to run on from midfield and receive the striker’s lay-offs. Others, too, have thrived. Ivan Perisic, whose adaptation to left wing-back was a key component in Inter’s title win under Conte, has found his way more often into scoring positions under Inzaghi. The Italy midfielder Nicolò Barella has matched his seven league assists from last season with three months to spare and is shooting twice as often. Whenever any player is asked about the difference between the managers, the same word recurs: “libertà” – freedom. Where Conte drilled specific movements and passing patterns repeatedly, Inzaghi has encouraged them to make more of their own judgments within a tactical framework. For some players, that shift has been transformational. Alessandro Bastoni, who typically starts on the left of Inter’s back three, was already on the way to emerging as one of Italy’s most promising talents but under Inzaghi has found the confidence to roam higher up the pitch, allowing Perisic to push on and to support the attack himself. Against Lazio in January, Bastoni opened the scoring with a side-footed finish from 25 yards. He then set up his defensive partner Milan Skriniar for the winning goal with as good a cross as any winger could provide. Despite some growing pains, Inter made it to Christmas in first place, four points clear of Milan and seven ahead of Napoli in third. Crucially, Inzaghi also got Inter through to the Champions League knockout phase, something Conte never managed. Inter have not reached this stage of Europe’s top competition in a decade. Can they go further? Inzaghi’s hope that they might arrive for the Liverpool tie in ideal shape has not come to pass. Inter fell off the top of the Serie A table on Sunday for the first time since early December. Their title defence is hardly blown – they have a game in hand that could vault them back into first – but the failure to win any of three matches against Atalanta, Napoli or Milan in the past month is troubling. The two-game European suspension issued to Barella for lashing out at Real Madrid’s Éder Militão is a heavy blow, likely obliging Inzaghi to draft Arturo Vidal – who has started one league game all season – into midfield against Liverpool. Up front, Lautaro Martínez is going through a dry run, with one goal in his past nine appearances. Bastoni will be playing his first game back from an ankle injury, as he lines up opposite Mohamed Salah. Inzaghi knows the scale of the challenge but took the opportunity in his pre-game press conference on Tuesday to remind reporters that: “We don’t start the game already beaten. We have a top club in front of us but every match starts at 0-0.” This was not the last-16 tie Inzaghi wanted. An underpinning success of his tenure at Inter so far, though, has been to find reasons to believe in his team’s possibilities, even where others could not.",Sport/Football,Inter have hope against Liverpool thanks to Simone Inzaghi’s free spirit | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/16/inter-have-hope-against-liverpool-thanks-to-simone-inzaghis-free-spirit
2/16/2022,"The man wrongly identified as Cleo Smith’s alleged kidnapper by the Seven Network has had a victory in the Western Australia supreme court, after suing the network for defamation. On Wednesday WA supreme court chief justice Peter Quinlan read out consent orders in favour of Terrance Flowers, a 27-year-old Nyamal man from the town of Karratha.  Flowers sued the network in November after his photograph was mistakenly used in Seven’s broadcasts, an online article, tweet and a Facebook post about the arrest of a different man. The man arrested has a similar name to that used by Flowers on Facebook where he used his mother’s maiden name, Kelly. The social media posts contained the heading “PICTURED: the man accused of abducting Cleo Smith”.After it became aware of the mistake, Channel Seven issued an apology stating the images had been removed “promptly”. But Flowers launched legal action against the network with lawyers saying he had been “gravely injured in his character and reputation” after the error. In a statement at the time his lawyers said the network’s error had made him “the subject of hate around the nation and the world and resulted in him being hospitalised with a severe panic attack”. Flowers was represented by the high-profile defamation barrister Sue Chrysanthou. But the case was settled on Wednesday, with Quinlan reading out consent orders in court in Flowers’ favour. The judge made no orders on costs, and in a statement Kelly’s lawyers said the case had “otherwise settled on confidential terms”. Flowers, who appeared in court on Wednesday via video link told WA Today he was “glad that it’s all over and it was settled”. Flowers, who also goes by his mother’s maiden name Kelly, had the judgment read out in court after the consent order was agreed to between his lawyers and the network. In a statement Flowers’ legal team, O’Brien Criminal and Civil Solicitors, said he was “looking forward to getting on with his life and enjoying time with his wife and baby son”. “The judgment was entered pursuant to consent orders agreed to by the parties,” his lawyer’s statement read. “The judge noted that the proceedings had otherwise settled on confidential terms.

Emergency services were called to Buchan Point in Malabar, off Little Bay Beach, about 4.35pm on Wednesday following reports a swimmer had been attacked by a shark.  Marine police crews and surf lifesavers scoured the scene, according to a New South Wales police statement, and “located human remains in the water”.

A witness told Guardian Australia the swimmer had been “mauled” by the shark and their blood had coloured the surrounding water red. Another witness, who had been fishing off nearby rocks at the time, told the ABC the swimmer was wearing a wetsuit and was dragged under the surf by a large shark with the attack lasting several seconds. “When he went down there were so many splashes,” the man told the ABC. “It was terrible, I am shaking.

Dylan Parker, the local mayor of Randwick council, said he was “absolutely shocked” by the attack. “Our community adores our coast. To lose someone like this is chilling to the core,” Parker said. Michael Daley, the MP for the state electorate of Maroubra, was at Little Bay on Wednesday evening. He said he was shocked and saddened by the swimmer’s death. He had travelled to the beach from parliament when the news broke. “The community is just shocked by this horrific incident,” he told Guardian Australia. “Our thoughts go out to the family involved.

2/16/2022,"Stalin was a voracious reader, who set himself a daily quota of between 300 and 500 pages. When he died of a stroke in his library in 1953, the desk and tables that surrounded him were piled high with books, many of them heavily marked with his handwriting in the margins. As he read, he made notes in red, blue and green pencils, underlining sections that interested him or numbering points that he felt were important. Sometimes he was effusive, noting: “yes-yes”, “agreed”, ‘“good”, “spot on”, “that’s right”. Sometimes he expressed disdain, scribbling: “ha ha”, “gibberish”, ‘“nonsense”, “rubbish”, “scumbag”, “scoundrels” and “piss off”. He became extremely irritated whenever he came across grammatical or spelling mistakes, and would correct errors with his red pencil.  During his life he amassed a personal library estimated at about 20,000 books, but he also read widely from the collections of friends. The Soviet poet Demyan Bedny complained that Stalin left greasy fingermarks on the books he borrowed. After Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin in 1956, plans to preserve the library in his dacha were abandoned and his books (which included volumes on child psychology, sport, religion, syphilis and hypnosis as well as works by Turgenev and Dostoevsky were dispersed, so it has become challenging to make an exhaustive study of what he enjoyed reading. Geoffrey Roberts acknowledges that many academics before him have scoured the remnants of his collection, hoping to glimpse Stalin’s true nature or find the “key to the character that made his rule so monstrous”. Roberts finds no smoking guns, but suggests: “By following the way Stalin read books, we can glimpse the world through his eyes. We may not get to peer into his soul, but we do get to wear his spectacles.” In the abstract, Stalin admired writers, telling the Soviet writers’ congress in 1934 that while civil engineers were needed to build socialism, the country also required “engineers of the human soul, writer engineers, building the human spirit”. He insisted that his family and colleagues should be equally well read. He gave his adopted son a copy of Robinson Crusoe, inscribing it with “the wish that he grows up to be a conscious, steadfast and fearless Bolshevik”. He gave his daughter a Short Course History of the Communist Party, commanding her to read it. Svetlana said she never bothered because “It bored me so.” (She later defected to the west). Sergo Beria, the son of Stalin’s security commissar Lavrenty Beria, claimed that when Stalin visited someone from his inner circle he would go into their library and start opening the books, to check for signs that they had actually been read. But he wrote frustratingly little about his views on literature. His huge collection of Russian and international classics – Pushkin, Gogol, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Hugo, Shakespeare – was lost after his death. So his thoughts on Dostoevsky, for example, can only be surmised from casual comments to friends who remember Stalin concluding he was a bad influence on Soviet youth rather than from incisive notes made during his reading. From the works that remain, we discover that he was very interested in history, preoccupied with the lessons of tsarist rule in Russia, ominously obsessed by the reigns of Ivan the Terrible and Peter and Catherine the Great. Most of the surviving annotated works relate to Marxist thought. Perhaps the biggest insight his book collection offers is that he was a diligent, reverential and genuinely enthusiastic reader of works by Lenin. Failing that, he settled for books written by his rivals. When Trotsky’s conclusions annoyed him, he wrote “Fool!” in the margins. Stalin kept no diary and wrote no memoirs, so these scribblings in the margins become invested with greater significance than perhaps they deserve. Roberts warns against reading too much into Stalin’s decision to underline a line attributed to Genghis Khan, “The death of the defeated is necessary for the peace of mind of the victors”, or assuming that the doodled word “Teacher” on the cover of a play about Ivan the Terrible means that Stalin viewed this tyrant as a role model. Roberts is startlingly forgiving towards Stalin, noting: “Given the scale of his misdeeds as Soviet ruler, it is natural to imagine him as a monster, to see him in the mind’s eye furiously denouncing opponents.” Instead he concludes that Stalin was “a dedicated idealist”, “no psychopath but an emotionally intelligent and feeling intellectual”. According to Vitaly Shentalinsky, in his book The KGB’s Literary Archive, approximately 1,500 writers perished during Stalin’s Terror. There is surprisingly little focus on their struggle in this book. Fascinating in parts, its promised insight into Stalin’s true feelings remains elusive.
