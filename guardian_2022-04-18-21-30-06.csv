4/18/2022,"Kamala Harris plays Wordle as a “brain cleanser” between official duties and has never failed to guess the five-letter word of the day, but cannot share successes with friends because her official phone does not let her send text messages. The vice-president discussed her love for the online game designed by Welsh-born Josh Wardle in an interview with the Ringer. “I have 100%,” she said, “and I intend to keep it that way.” She also said her winning streak was just 48, because “it got messed up when it got moved over to the New York Times”. Wardle designed Wordle for his partner. The Times bought it in January for a price “in the low seven figures”. Players of Wordle are given six chances to guess one five-letter word a day, coloured squares indicating letters in the right slot or contained in the word elsewhere. Harris said she averaged four guesses and started with the same word every day: “Notes. N-O-T-E-S.” She added: “I think that you have to have a healthy mix of consonants and vowels, and a lot of words come with an S. For example, today there was an S and an E, I believe.” Harris was speaking on Friday, when the word of the day was “shame”. The vice-president said she sometimes played while traveling, and “must have played it when I was in Poland”. Harris visited Poland in March, to bolster US allies amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “But we won’t talk about that, right?” she said. Wordle, Harris said, “is like a brain cleanser. So it’s in the middle of very long days, back-to-back meetings on a lot of intense issues. If I have a break, let’s say that people are running late or my little 25 minutes for lunch, sometimes while I’m eating I’ll figure out Wordle.” She also said she had tried to convert her staff – a body subject to perennial reports of drama and discontents – to the game. “Some of them know it,” she said. “Some of them laugh about it, because they didn’t know that I know it and that I play it. So that was really funny. And then there are others that I have, you know, in a moment of stress said, ‘Maybe you should learn how to play Wordle.’” Harris also said her staff were very competitive over the game, but “what I love about my team is that they don’t tell on each other”. The vice-president, however, does not compete with anyone other than her husband, Doug Emhoff, because she cannot share her results like a normal user. “My phone doesn’t let me text anybody,” Harris said, “which is sad.” Harris praised the “smart design” of the game, which she said offered her “just a nice kind of cleansing the palate in the middle of a lot of other stuff”. Asked if she had any examples of stressful moments in which Wordle came to the rescue, Harris said: “They’re all classified. Sorry.”",News/US news,Notes on a Wordle: Kamala Harris describes love for online word game,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/18/wordle-kamala-harris-word-game
4/18/2022,"In cakes, I am relaxed about sugar and fat, as long as I don’t eat them every day. Even so, there are good cakes and there are bad ones. In my unscientific view, cakes made with ground nuts are always good – not only do they taste great, all moist and chewy, but they stay fresh for longer, too. This one uses unrefined brown sugar and spelt flour (though you could try other wheat varieties). The deep pistachio shade is stunning, as is the combination of white chocolate, cardamom and lemon. A deliciously chewy, citrus-topped pistachio cake spiked with cardamom and white chocolate chunks.

Cream the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer until light, fluffy and pale. In a food processor, pulse 200g of the pistachios to a fine flour (don’t over-process or they’ll turn to a paste). Meanwhile, crush the cardamon pods in a mortar, remove the outer kernels and finely grind the seeds. Beat the vanilla, the zest of two of the lemons and the ground pistachios into the butter, then add the juice of one of the lemons. Add the eggs one at a time, making sure each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Fold in the flour, baking powder, salt and cardamom with a large metal spoon, mixing everything gently and briefly. Stir in the chocolate, then transfer to the lined tin. Bake for 50 minutes, covering with foil about halfway through so the top doesn’t brown too much. While the cake is cooling, make the icing. Beat the cheeses in a bowl, stir in the juice of another lemon, then sift in the icing sugar. Add more lemon juice from the third lemon,to taste. Spread the mascarpone icing over top of the cooled cake. Roughly chop the remaining pistachios and sprinkle them over the cake along with the last of the lemon zest. This cake will keep in an airtight container for four to five days. To make the cake vegan, use aquafaba or chia seeds instead of the eggs and olive or vegetable oil instead of the butter. And make a lemon drizzle as a replacement for the cheese icing.

4/18/2022,"Agroup of elderly Italian men sit around drinking red wine, eating spaghetti and trading local folk stories passed down by their parents and grandparents. It was different back then, explains one old boy; there was no TV, so people had to sit around talking of an evening (though sitting around talking is precisely what this lot are doing). He tells the tale of Luciano, the illegitimate son of a local doctor sometime in the 19th century. It’s a dark story, he warns. Though possibly not dark enough. What first-time feature directors Alessio Rigo de Righi and Matteo Zoppis seem to be going for here is a Herzogian waking nightmare, but the necessary sense of horror and despair never fully comes off. Their film gives us two episodes in the life of legendary Luciano, a drunk who villagers whisper has seen the inside of a psychiatric hospital. He’s played by Gabriele Silli, an artist and painter friend of the directors acting here for the first time, bringing a tortured Nick Cave quality to the part – as well as a pair piercing green eyes just right for the part of a loner who might be half-crazed or a visionary. Luciano is furious with a local nobleman for locking a wooden gate usually left open to let shepherds pass. His anger might have something to do with being in love with shepherd’s daughter Emma (Maria Alexandra Lungu) – though cinematographer Simone D’Arcangelo’s gorgeous shots of the Italian countryside are far more ravishing than the pair’s deeply un-sensual, mannered romantic scenes. Something dramatic happens, and the action moves to Argentina a few years later, where the film goes full Herzog. Luciano is now impersonating a preacher and looking for hidden treasure in the company of thieving pirates and the crab of the title – a mad folly of an expedition that doesn’t feel quite warped enough, lacking somehow in striking images or mood. It never quite comes together.

4/18/2022,"“Even if the aliens are short, dour and sexually obsessed,” the late cosmologist Carl Sagan once mused, “if they’re here, I want to know about them.” Driven by the same mindset, a Nasa-led team of international scientists has developed a new message that it proposes to beam across the galaxy in the hope of making first contact with intelligent extraterrestrials. The interstellar missive, known as the Beacon in the Galaxy, opens with simple principles for communication, some basic concepts in maths and physics, the constituents of DNA, and closes with information about humans, the Earth, and a return address should any distant recipients be minded to reply. The group of researchers, headed by Dr Jonathan Jiang at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, says that with technical upgrades the binary message could be broadcast into the heart of the Milky Way by the Seti Institute’s Allen Telescope Array in California and the 500-metre Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope in China. In a preliminary paper, which has not been peer reviewed, the scientists recommend sending the message to a dense ring of stars near the centre of the Milky Way – a region deemed most promising for life to have emerged. “Humanity has, we contend, a compelling story to share and the desire to know of others – and now has the means to do so,” the scientists write. The message, if it ever leaves Earth, would not be the first. The Beacon in the Galaxy is loosely based on the Arecibo message sent in 1974 from an observatory of the same name in Puerto Rico. That targeted a cluster of stars about 25,000 light years away, so it will not arrive any time soon. Since then, a host of messages have been beamed into the heavens including an advert for Doritos and an invitation, written in Klingon, to a Klingon Opera in The Hague. Such attempts at interstellar communication are not straightforward. The odds of an intelligent civilisation intercepting a message may be extremely low, and even if contact were made, establishing a fruitful conversation could prove frustrating when a response can take tens of thousands of years. Aliens may not even understand the signal: as a test run for the Arecibo message, Frank Drake, its designer, posted the missive to some scientific colleagues, including a number of Nobel laureates. None of them understood it. There are other concerns, too. More than a decade ago, Prof Stephen Hawking warned that humans should refrain of sending messages into space in case they attract the wrong sort of attention. “If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans,” he told a Discovery channel documentary. But Dr Jiang and his colleagues argue that an alien species capable of communication across the cosmos may well have learned the value of peace and collaboration, and humanity could have much to learn from them. “We believe the advancements of science that can be achieved in pursuit of this task, if communication were to be established, would vastly outweigh the concerns,” they write. Dr Anders Sandberg, a senior research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, said: “My view is that the overall risk and benefit of sending messages are both small; it is better and safer for us to move out into space and hopefully, eventually, find neighbours when we are both adult species.” But he said it was worthwhile to think over how we may communicate with aliens. “I think it is something we should regard as training for learning to coordinate better as a species,” he added.",News/Science,Scientists hope to broadcast DNA and Earth’s location for curious aliens,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/18/scientists-hope-to-broadcast-dna-and-earths-location-for-curious-aliens
4/18/2022,"The NHS’s biggest mental health trust has been accused of undermining its own workforce’s wellbeing by shutting its staff nursery, despite it being a “lifeline” for them. Dozens of doctors, nurses and other staff at the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) trust in the capital face having to find alternative childcare because of its decision. The loss of the nursery has provoked frustration and anger among staff. They claim that the closure is adding to the stress levels being experienced by overstretched staff and makes a mockery of the trust’s commitment to improving its personnel’s working lives. The nursery is due to close its doors in summer next year as part of a massive redevelopment of the trust’s site, including the demolition of Mapother House, where it is based. It and other old buildings are being demolished as part of a scheme to give the trust new treatment facilities that is being financed partly by the construction of 187 new homes on its land. Staff and health unions have warned that the closure will deepen the trust’s problems in recruiting and retaining enough staff to care for adults and children with serious mental health problems. Staff affected are worried that, while the trust plans to include a nursery in the new buildings it will gain as a result of the redevelopment, the replacement facility will not open until 2027-28. A trust official sought to allay staff concerns and said SLaM would provide a temporary nursery to cover the years-long gap between its closure and the new facility opening. A petition protesting against the closure of Cedar House nursery gained more than 1,300 signatures within days and scores of staff have signed a letter expressing their “concern and dismay”. In a section headed “staff stress and wellbeing”, the letter laments what it says is the trust’s “seeming dismissal of a valued service and its frontline workers. It seems counterproductive to remove a facility which has such a direct consequence on staff wellbeing.” The nursery’s workers are “dedicated, compassionate and highly skilled”, and the fact that it stayed open during the Covid pandemic enabled SLaM staff to keep working when other nurseries shut, it adds. The nursery stays open for unusually long hours, helping staff who work long shifts. One specialist children and young people’s mental health nurse, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “I’m on a lower pay scale than many and will really struggle to pay private nursery fees – our local nursery is £100 per day. That, plus a London mortgage, means I am seriously considering whether it is feasible for me to continue working in the trust should Cedar House close.” Jamie Brown, the London head of health for the union Unison, said: “Hospital-based childcare is crucial in allowing NHS staff to work long shifts. Many often work outside normal working hours when other nurseries are closed. “Closing essential support services will place immense stress on employees forced to look for alternative childcare. Others may well quit for jobs elsewhere.” Helen Hayes, the Labour MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, has written to the SLaM chief executive, Dr David Bradley, seeking a meeting about the closure. She is concerned about the potential loss of a facility “that parents hugely value, that offers exceptionally high quality early years education and is affordable relative to other nurseries in the local area”, she told the Guardian. A SLaM spokesperson said: “Nursery provision is important to us and we are proactively exploring the feasibility of an established nursery company providing childcare services to staff and expect to conclude this work soon.”",News/Society,London NHS mental health trust in row over staff nursery closure,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/18/london-nhs-mental-health-trust-in-row-over-staff-nursery-closure
4/18/2022,"The mayor of Lviv has accused the Kremlin of genocide after four Russian missiles smashed into the western Ukrainian city on Monday, killing seven people and injuring at least 11. Andriy Sadovyi said there were no longer any “safe” or “unsafe” areas left in Ukraine. “What we see today is genocide. It’s a deliberate action by the aggressor to kill peaceful civilians,” he said, adding: “All our cities and villages are in the same situation.” Russia carried out a number of lethal long-range airstrikes early on Monday against what it claimed were military targets. The attacks came amid expectations of a major offensive by Moscow over the coming days in the east and the industrial Donbas region. Sadovyi said one of the rockets struck a Lviv garage and tyre repair workshop, killing four people. Others were injured including a child, with two adults critically hurt. Nearby windows were blown out including in a school, he said. Maksym Kozytskyy, the head of Lviv’s regional military administration, said the strikes were part of a “cynical and inhuman” pattern by the Russian government and its military. They were trying to intimidate Ukraine by going after civilians, the mayor said, adding: “Look at what’s going on in Mariupol. Thousands of innocent people were killed. What we have seen in Bucha and Hostomel is horrible.” The Russian opposition politician Ivan Zhdanov said the bombing in Lviv made no military sense. He said the Kalibr missile fired from thousands of kilometres away cost $6.5m (£5m) and had landed on a tyre workshop. “What’s the logic here? Are they complete morons?” he tweeted. Я не понимаю. Объясните пожалуйста. Стоимость одного ""калибра"" 6,5 млн $. Они его запускают за тысячу километров чтобы расфигачить шиномонтаж во Львове? Какая тут логика? Они совсем дебилы? pic.twitter.com/mKDCOGpcFx Russia has previously bombed more plausible targets in and around Lviv including a tank repair factory and a military base. The Unesco-listed city famous for its baroque and neo-classical architecture has been largely spared the Syria-style destruction suffered by Mariupol, Kharkiv and towns on the Donbas frontline. Lviv is a temporary home to several hundred thousand people displaced by fighting from other parts of Ukraine. It is also a logistical hub for western arms deliveries sent via Poland. “We are using all possible routes to supply weapons to our army,” Kozytskyy said. In a statement Russia’s defence ministry said air-launched missiles had wiped out Ukrainian ammunition dumps. It said it had targeted areas across the country including the cities of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, as well as the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions and the southern port of Mykolaiv. Sadovyi, a one-time presidential candidate, said Vladimir Putin was determined to subjugate the whole of Ukraine. “We have to kick the enemy from our land,” he said. “They want to turn us into slaves. We will fight to the last drop of blood because we are Ukrainians.” He said the west had to understand that war in Ukraine went beyond the fate of one country and was between totalitarian and democratic systems. “We are defending everyone. Germany, Poland, Lithuania. We’re taking the hit but the same missile tomorrow could be flying to a different country.” He continued: “We have to be a fist. We have to punch the enemy so hard that he cannot be an aggressor for the next 50 years.”",News/World news,Lviv mayor accuses Russia of genocide as missiles strike city,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/lviv-mayor-accuses-russia-genocide-missiles-strike-city-ukraine
4/18/2022,"My grandfather Douglas Coxell, who has died aged 100, spent most of his life flying – initially in the second world war before training RAF pilots in peacetime, and then for a civilian airline in the Channel Islands, where he was a pilot until retirement at 65. Even then he continued to fly as a training captain for the Channel Islands Air Search service until the age of 86, hanging up his goggles only when he could no longer find a company that would insure him. Doug was born in Peterborough to Sybil (nee Cox) and Horace Coxell, an officer in the first world war who went on to be a railway clerk. After leaving school at 14, Doug worked at the London Brick Company, tried his hand as a policeman in the Huntingdonshire Constabulary – opening his eyes to village life behind closed doors – and then in 1942 joined the RAF. He was sent to flying school, at first in Scotland and then in Texas, and on his return, having gained his wings, he was initially assigned to Fighter Command, then 38 Group, which eventually became part of the newly formed Transport Command. The squadron then moved to Stoney Cross in the New Forest in 1944 to begin training for what would become known as D-day. Aged 22, Doug was one of the first pilots to drop paratroopers over Normandy at the start of D-day operations on 6 June 1944, flying a twin-engine Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle. Night flights to drop supplies and the occasional agents to the resistance in France, the Netherlands and Norway were navigated by moonlight at low altitudes, using rivers and lakes for reference. This resulted in a number of close calls. Transferring to a four-engine Handley Page Halifax, Doug and crew also towed gliders in air operations over Arnhem and the Rhine. Their last wartime mission was during the liberation of Norway and all of those involved remained lifelong friends. After the war Doug returned to the police force, but the lure of flying was too great. He joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve and in 1954 was commissioned back into the RAF to train pilots on piston aircraft and jets. When a desk job beckoned, he joined Aurigny Air Services in the Channel Islands, where he was the inspiration for the character of Captain Keen, pilot of a little plane, G-Joey, in a series of six children’s books called The Little Yellow Plane Adventures that were published by the airline. After retiring, he continued to fly as training captain for the Channel Islands Air Search for another 21 years. He was awarded the French Légion d’honneur in 2016, and the Norwegian Medal of Honour in 2021. Resident in Guernsey, Doug was a keen sailor in the treacherous waters of the Channel Islands and northern France. He put his longevity down to a daily swim – which he maintained well into his 90s – as well as a tot of whisky, never to be missed. He had a warm personality and an unfailing sense of humour. In 1944 – a month after D-day – he married Margaret Wright. After their divorce, in 1982 he married Jan White, a nurse. She survives him, as do two daughters from his first marriage, a stepson and stepdaughter from his second, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.",News/UK news,Douglas Coxell obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/18/douglas-coxell-obituary
4/18/2022,"“We don’t think it’s too late. We hope that our vision might reach the offices in Hong Kong where they are deciding the future of our neighbourhood.” In Deptford, south-east London, activist Marion Briggs is part of a group of campaigners making a last-ditch effort to change the trajectory of gentrification in the area. Head off the high street towards the river, turn past the Dog and Bell pub and long white hoardings bring the streets of low-rise council homes to an end. This is Convoys Wharf, a huge riverside building site, once a shipyard for Henry VIII and now being prepared for 3,500 homes – the majority for private ownership. Three huge towers of 38 and 48 storeys will dominate the skyline. In the block set aside for “affordable” homes, the majority are shared ownership, the rest “affordable rent”. There are no homes at social rent levels. The development will also contain 1,800 parking spaces. The Hong Kong-based developer Hutchison Whampoa – led by one of the world’s richest men, Li Ka-shing – has pushed relentlessly over the past decade to get these plans through against local resistance. When Lewisham council said no, Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, overruled it. Now, at the final hour, as diggers arrive to lay foundations, local group Voice 4 Deptford has produced what it says is a “greener” vision that recognises the climate emergency. With plans drawn up by Herta Gatter, a planning apprentice, as part of her master’s degree, the group has designed a greener, more locally rooted development. It proposes weaving local history and culture into the site and replacing the towers – which activists say use more water than lower density blocks – with homes that have more shared space for children to play. “All along the consultation was poor,” says Briggs. “Hutchison Whampoa are thinking about a certain group of people when they build – and that is young professional high earners. Developments like this are for investment, they are not intended to satisfy the needs of the local community.” The group is not alone in hoping that a detailed “greener vision” might help it take on the complex and unbalanced planning system. The Mayday Saxonvale project in Frome, Somerset is, its designers claim, the first community-led masterplan in the UK. “If we succeed here, it will be the first time anything on this scale has been achieved by a community-led development,” says the project’s director, Paul Oster. He is part of a collective of experts who have produced detailed alternative plans for the brownfield mixed-use town centre site. The proposal is to fund the building of the site through a joint venture with Stories, a socially responsible property development company. “We think our ‘Mayday Model’ could pave the way for genuine community-led development across the UK,” says Oster. “Our view is that the plan as it currently stands is solely designed to make large profitable returns back to the district council. We want a greener site and because we are building this on a not-for-profit plan, we can put higher levels of investment into environmental design. “We have a huge amount of support from the community.” The thousands of hours that go into preparing alternative plans are a huge commitment for local residents. In Totnes, Devon, local people spent 13 years trying to buy and build on land that was then sold to other buyers – they say unfairly – at the last minute. In London many bitter battles are fought over small patches of doorstep green space. Pushing for alternative designs is not easy. Earlier this month Sarah Correia was given two minutes to speak against proposals by Lambeth council to demolish a former care home and build two large towers that will provide more than 60 affordable homes, including 41 for social rent. Residents say it will reduce light for locals and leave the local park in shadow for most of the afternoon. “Green spaces matter to mental health in deprived communities,” says Correia. “The towers will overshadow the park after school and on summer evenings. For our children, sitting on that green is their only holiday.” Locals formed the group Save Lambeth Walk, producing architect-designed plans for a “greener” refurbishment of the current site, which they say would provide just as many homes without the towers. Lambeth council says the alternative was considered and that it is constantly balancing difficult decisions when building desperately needed new homes. A spokesperson from Homes for Lambeth, the building arm of the council, said: “Consultation began back in 2020 during the pandemic and the recent proposals came just before the decision went to planning committee. We considered them and think the tower design is better than a low-rise site which would have a larger footprint.” He added: “Homes are more important than losing an hour or two of daylight.” Meanwhile the council looking at the Deptford project says the development will provide about three hectares of green space as well as £175,000 – under section 106 for community funding – for local parks and playgrounds. Hutchison Whampoa did not respond to requests for comment. In Frome, Oster believes communities could help shape genuinely sustainable development. “Up and down the country towns are facing high-density housing schemes that ignore local planning policies. Communities need a long-term vision for generations to come, not short-term profit grabs for councils and developers.”",News/Society,Communities fight back developers with ‘greener’ plans for UK housing,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/18/communities-fight-back-developers-with-greener-plans-for-uk-housing
