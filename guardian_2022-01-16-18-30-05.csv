1/16/2022,"The Conservative press has been put in an awkward position in recent days. They all supported Johnson in the 2019 general election, but his conduct in office, and management of Downing Street during the pandemic, has since proved every bit as haphazard as his critics had suggested it might.  Here, the Guardian looks at the Sunday newspaper editorials and comment pieces. They mostly reflect surprise, anger and despair – but none actually call for him to quit. Where did it all go wrong? The PM should show the voters who gave him a landslide that he is still on their side by scrapping the projected increase in National Insurance as part of a total rethink on tax and spend … Time was when Mr Johnson identified himself as standing on the side of the consumer, as a liberal-minded and patriotic politician who thought that the Government should largely leave people alone. This has been jettisoned in favour of the nanny state and social-democracy, which is both an economic miscalculation and a political one. Are Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg, anti-car activists, and supporters of big government and higher taxes now queuing up to defend the Prime Minister? Successive Tory governments have bent over backwards to give the Left everything it wants with no electoral payoff whatsoever. Key to political survival is loyalty: remember who put you where you are and why … Unusually, perhaps, the Mail on Sunday did not write an editorial on the prime minister’s woes, preferring to focus on its criticism of the BBC. Two opinion pieces made the case for keeping Johnson. Dr Liam Fox, Conservative MP and former defence secretaryThose who hate Johnson because of his role in the referendum campaign, or because they are unwavering in their opposition to the Conservative Party, will never be placated. We should not be swayed by their voices … Given that the pandemic has become the defining issue of Johnson’s government, we will only know its real agenda in the coming months. We should defer judgment. This is a time for unity over division, hard work over personal ambition and putting the country before the party. It is not a time for a leadership challenge. Peter HitchensHeaven knows I am no supporter or defender of Johnson. Even on his own terms, his behaviour has been dismal. I think he betrayed everything he supposedly stood for when he closed the country that evening nearly two years ago. He listened to the wrong experts and allowed the promotion of a terrible exaggerated fear, which has permanently ruined many lives and which he still has not managed to disperse. But I do wonder why he is now in such trouble, just after he had begun to show signs of regaining his reason. Johnson’s longevity is a more complicated question. On one level it is axiomatic that voters, exercising their will at the ballot box, get the politicians they deserve. When you consider that the alternative in 2019 was Jeremy Corbyn, it puts a different light on the old adage. Sir Keir Starmer, for all his improvements to Labour’s front bench, remains some way from looking like the winner of the next election. Hoping for Johnson to change is pointless: he won’t. We can only hope that this era of destructive decadence eventually gives way to something brighter. Perhaps, out of the bewildering mess that is Johnson’s premiership, a challenger will at some point emerge who can combine competence with trustworthiness and a little entrepreneurial vision. Is that too much to ask? Boris Johnson’s lack of grip over the Downing Street lockdown parties and their fallout has been staggering. The Prime Minister has admitted joining one bash as voters endured strict restrictions which prevented them seeing dying loved ones. At another do, a fridge was stocked with booze while the nation prepared to mark the death of Prince Philip. We report today that around 35 Tory MPs have submitted no confidence letters in the PM to the backbench 1922 Committee. That was before they returned to their constituencies this weekend to face the full ire of furious voters. Another 20 or so letters will trigger a disastrous leadership contest that could seal his fate … Now Boris is pinning his hopes on the Partygate inquiry by civil servant Sue Gray. Even if he is cleared of serious rulebreaking, Boris’s famed ability to wriggle out of scrapes will be tested to the limit. The PM urgently needs to re-establish the trust of the British people if he is to survive. We hope that Boris Johnson and those around him will now do the right thing for the health of our politics. The surest way to stop the seemingly almost daily toxic deluge of scandals about lockdownera partying is to ensure that every single incident is fully reported to the senior civil servant Sue Gray as she pursues her forensic investigation. This debacle must not delay urgent work to revitalise the economy, rescue health and social care and make up for lost time in education. And there is also the big challenge of delivering on all the promises of the 2019 election and levelling-up Britain’s poorest communities. Millions of people will enjoy the return of full freedoms to daily life on January 26, but politics will not get back to normal until the full story of an elite’s illicit partying is disclosed.",News/Politics,‘Where did it all go wrong?’: how the Tory press is turning on Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/where-did-it-all-go-wrong-how-the-tory-press-is-turning-on-boris-johnson
1/16/2022,"A British man who was stripped of his citizenship by the Home Office for almost five years has described the “devastating” impact of the decision as the government pursues fresh powers to remove a person’s citizenship without warning. The 40-year-old, who was born in London, returns to the UK this week after being stranded in Bangladesh since 2017 when the Home Office served a deprivation of citizenship order on him shortly after he flew to the country for the birth of his second daughter.  E3, as he is referred to in court documents, was working in the UK when he travelled to Bangladesh but not earning enough to sponsor his wife to join him and has since been stateless and destitute with his wife and three daughters. According to the Home Office’s deprivation order, the Briton was “an Islamist extremist who had previously sought to travel abroad to participate in terrorism-related activity” and that he posed a threat to national security. Although the UK government has reinstated his citizenship, his lawyers say they have received no explanation or any specific details to support the claims. E3 has never been charged with any criminal offence in the UK or elsewhere. E3 told the Observer: “The allegation against me is so vague that it even suggests that I only tried to travel to some unknown destination to take part in an unspecified activity related to terrorism. “How on earth do you defend yourself against an allegation like that, especially when the government relies on secret evidence? The disclosure my solicitors received was almost entirely redacted so I have no idea what the government is referring to. “Why was I not arrested and questioned? Why have I been punished in this way without ever being shown a single piece of evidence against me? The government should admit that they have made a mistake and own up to it.” It comes as politicians consider controversial plans contained in the contentious nationality and borders bill, which is going through the House of Lords, to allow the Home Office to remove someone’s citizenship without the need to inform them. The plans have prompted warnings that ethnic minorities could be treated differently from white Britons for committing the same crime. “Being left stateless and not knowing why I was suddenly stripped of my citizenship had an extremely adverse impact on my mental health. It was the most depressing period of my life,” said E3. “Being British is a fundamental part of my identity, but it really feels like you need more than just being born and raised in the UK to really be considered one. Having an ethnic background relegates you to being a second-class citizen,” he added. Fahad Ansari, his lawyer at Duncan Lewis, said: “My client lost five years of his life because of the unlawful decision of the home secretary that lacked any prior judicial oversight.” During E3’s period of statelessness in Bangladesh, his wife gave birth to another child in 2019, but because E3 was not considered British, the child was denied British citizenship. Despite her father’s citizenship being reinstated, the Home Office is refusing to accept that the daughter is a British citizen. The high court has granted E3 and his daughter permission for a judicial review of that decision and a hearing is expected in the spring, with E3 saying that one of the main reasons for returning to the UK was to help the legal fight as well as to see his frail mother. Ansari said: “We will continue fighting for his baby daughter to be recognised as a British citizen as is her legal right so that she can join him in the UK.” The case also has ramifications for many children stranded in the refugee camps in Syria, who were born after their parents were deprived of their citizenship on the same basis as E3. Anas Mustapha, communications manager of advocacy group Cage, said: “E3’s case brings into sharp focus the devastating impact of citizenship deprivation and its often forgotten victims, the children of those deprived. “E3 has been successful in overturning the decision but many others must reckon with the state-imposed exile as it is impossible to meaningfully challenge it due to the use of secret evidence.” E3 married in Bangladesh in 2013 and his first daughter was born a year later. Working in the UK and sending money to his wife in Bangladesh, he travelled to be with her on 19 April 2017 for the birth of his second daughter. His two older daughters have British citizenship. On 3 June 2017, a deprivation of citizenship notice was sent to his mother’s London address – the day before E3 was due to return home. The Home Office followed it up with a call to his mother informing her that E3 would not be able to return to the UK. E3’s British citizenship was restored following a judgment that he had effectively been left stateless because he could not have Bangladeshi citizenship like his parents: he forfeited that right by not claiming it by the age of 21. Speaking to the Observer on the eve of his return to London, E3 said that he could not wait to see his mother but felt “very sad” at leaving his wife and daughters behind and facing an uncertain future. “I have also missed taking long walks in the UK countryside, getting out to the beach in the summer, watching Match of the Day with my friends, and just the general sense of humour everyone has there. There is nothing quite like British sarcasm,” he said. The Home Office has been contacted for comment.",News/Politics,British man made stateless by Home Office has citizenship reinstated,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/british-man-made-stateless-by-home-office-has-citizenship-reinstated
1/16/2022,"It is getting more expensive to stay in touch, with many mobile phone users facing higher bills in the coming months – especially if they plan to go on holiday. Virgin Mobile customers will see an annual price rise of 3.9% above January’s RPI inflation rate for calls – currently prices increase in line with the RPI index – while Tesco Mobile pay-monthly customers face price rises from 9 February for sending picture messages, calling internationally, and adding more data to their plans.  Meanwhile this year Vodafone, EE and Three plan to bring in a £2-a-day roaming charge for those travelling to Europe – potentially leading to heavy bills for families after two weeks in the sun. So how can you save money while staying mobile? Buying a bundled deal, where the phone and the contract come together, means you could miss out on better deals if the two are taken separately. With O2, you can buy a new iPhone 13 on a 24-month contract with 150GB of data and unlimited calls and texts, for just under £50 a month – £28 of which is for data and calls. But if you were to buy the phone separately, you could get a sim-only deal with O2 for £15 with 100GB of data. This also means you can choose the length of time you commit to a contract, usually from one month onwards. There are numerous sites where the best deals can be compared: MoneySavingExpert, Uswitch and GoCompare among them. Shelling out large amounts for a new mobile will not possible for everyone, however. Apple operates an iPhone upgrade programme through its stores when the cost of one of the phones can be spread over 20 months. A 0% credit card allows you to roll out the price – Barclaycard currently has one for up to 24 months, while the M&S card runs up to 23 months. However, consumers will have to go through credit checks to get a 0% card and should ensure they pay off the money during the period – essentially treating the card as a loan. Consumers nearing the end of their phone and sim contract should always consider breaking up the two, or at least switching, says Lisa Barber of consumer organisation Which? “Otherwise you could end up paying for a phone that you’ve already paid off,” she says. There is often good value to be found with so-called “mobile virtual network operators” (MVNOs) such as iD Mobile, Talkmobile, Tesco Mobile and Plusnet, among many others. These operators lease their networks from the four main providers, and can often provide attractive deals as they have lower overheads, says Hannah Isitt of GoCompare. “The mobile signal will be identical, but you won’t really get the same added benefits of a bigger network – things like O2 Priority, free Netflix subscriptions, family plans, 24/7 customer service, free wifi hotspot use,” says Kim Staples from MoneySuperMarket. After years of hype, 5G is now standard on new mobiles, meaning users can access a lot more, a lot faster. It can be up to 10 times faster than 4G – a movie will download in seconds rather than minutes. But in terms of bills, users may find themselves using an awful lot more data as they take advantage of the faster speeds. Ernest Doku, a mobiles expert from Uswitch, warns to be very wary of how you use a new 5G device. “While you have the ability to stream videos without interruption, you’ll also find that it has the potential to guzzle your data.” There is good news, however, in that data deals are becoming more competitive. Those with higher limits start from about £12 a month. Talkmobile has 50GB for £5.97 a month for three months, and then £11.95 after. For 100GB, Talkmobile also costs £11.95 with a one-month contract. For unlimited data, Three and iD Mobile have 12-month contracts at £18 a month. Anyone who thinks they can use the extra data by connecting other devices – “tethering” – to their mobile should check the small print to see whether there are any limits on how much they can share. “Check that tethering, or using a wifi hotspot, is allowed as part of your data bundle, and that there are no restrictions. This is particularly important on unlimited data deals,” says Barber. Since Brexit, mobile operators have the option of reintroducing roaming charges for UK consumers who travel to Europe. Vodafone plans to introduce a £2 daily charge by the end of January. Three says there will be a £2 fee from May, and EE from March. But Virgin Media and O2 customers have been told they will not face any roaming charges. While there are some deals to avoid the full effect of the charge – EE has a 30-day roaming pass for £10, and Vodafone has eight and 15-day passes which reduce the daily price to £1 – costs could still easily mount up. A family of four, all with mobiles, face the possibility of a £112 bill for using their phones every day over two weeks on the continent. The easiest way to avoid the charge is to simply turn off roaming and use whatever wifi is available. Since it is now relatively easy to switch provider, anyone who wants to move to another operator which does not have roaming charges should see whether they will be penalised for leaving a contract early, says Isitt. Changing phones will leave you with a potentially valuable old phone, which can be traded in to take the edge off the bill for a new one. An iPhone XR can fetch £175 if in top condition from the musicMagpie site, while a Samsung Galaxy S9 can net £81. There are any number of sites where you can sell phones – from those run by manufacturers to companies linked to the resellers – but the price quoted can quickly drop depending on the condition. A minor scratch on the screen of an iPhone XR can decrease the amount from £160 to £40 with Apple. Isitt says phones can also be recycled, often saving on buying another handset. “You might want to think about other options – for example, your old device might make a great first phone for your child, or it could become a second phone for a student to take with them when they go backpacking, or even as a spare to keep in the house for emergencies.” Students can often get discounts through sites such as UniDays, while members of the emergency services, NHS, social care sector and armed forces can get discounts by using the Blue Light Card, which costs just under a fiver for two years. Some of the operators have cashback offers via certain credit cards or cashback sites, and it is worth checking with your bank in case it has offers.",Lifestyle/Money,How to keep your mobile bills down at home and abroad,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/16/how-to-keep-your-mobile-bills-down-at-home-and-abroad
1/16/2022,"In the market town of Amersham on the edge of the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire, Christmas seemed to arrive a bit late this year. Families complained that they did not get their usual flurry of cards dropping on their doormats until the first week of 2022. Some residents said they barely saw a postal worker last month but, in the new year, there was a sudden deluge of late cards and missing post.  There were notifications about hospital appointments that had been missed, crucial legal documents that had been delayed for weeks, and even a death certificate that had been stuck in the post. “It has been chaos,” said Karen Martin, 75, an artist and former midwife. “Seven or eight of my Christmas cards arrived a few days ago. I was also sent a cheque in the post on 16 December and it still hasn’t arrived.” Kathleen Williamson, 43, a singer and music teacher, said: “There was barely any post before Christmas and then everything came at once on 5 January. I feel sorry for the postal workers because they are really trying.” Martin Tett, leader of Buckinghamshire council, has written to Keith Williams, the Royal Mail chairman, complaining that one resident received 24 Christmas cards on 5 January. The local sorting office has been inundated with householders hoping to find their missing mail. “We’ve had people complaining they’ve not had a delivery in a month,” said Tett. “There are queues around the Amersham sorting office and residents have been told there are stacks of unsorted post inside. The service has been atrocious.” It is not just some residential areas of Amersham that have fallen into a postal black hole over the past few months. On 22 July last year, during what postal watchdog Ofcom said was a “regulatory emergency period”, there were just 10 areas in England that were suffering significant disruption to mail. Last Tuesday, the number had risen to 77 areas in England, and there were another 18 areas affected in Wales and Scotland, according to Royal Mail. More than 120 postal districts have been hit across the country over the Christmas and new year period, including areas in London, Oxford, Chelmsford, Sheffield, Merseyside and Glasgow. Householders have complained of a deteriorating service over many months. The number of postal districts affected last week is the highest-ever recorded in the Royal Mail disruption updates. The bosses of Royal Mail now face scrutiny over their performance – and the justification for huge payouts to shareholders. The postal giant increased the price of a first-class stamp to 85p from March 2020, a rise of 21%. It made £726m profit before tax in the year to 28 March 2021 and in November announced a £400m payout via a special dividend and share buyback. At the same time, it has repeatedly failed to hit its delivery targets, blaming Covid-related isolation, vacancy rates and sickness. Under the Postal Services Act 2011, the Royal Mail has a legal “universal service obligation” to provide a six-day-a-week service for the delivery and collection of letters. Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: “We know [postal workers] are working hard to deliver our letters and parcels but we’re increasingly concerned about Royal Mail delays.” Executives will be keen to improve performance and there is a reorganisation in progress. The Observer has confirmed that Achim Dünnwald, chief operating officer at Royal Mail, has recently stepped down, but the company said this weekend it would not comment on the terms of his departure. Two senior “service delivery directors” have also left their roles. Paul Dornan, 48, a writer who lives in Crouch End, north London, said the usual post rounds in his neighbourhood had stopped for about a month over the Christmas period. He said: “Soldiers used to send letters back from the front in the first world war that arrived the next day and the Royal Mail can’t deliver a card from Yorkshire within a month. “The postal service has broken down in this area. Some people have resorted to going to the sorting office, but have been told: there is so much unsorted stuff we can’t give it to you. “The Royal Mail are shovelling cash into the pockets of their shareholders, but they are not delivering the post. It’s a massive dereliction of duty.” Helen Wallis, 67, from Herne Hill in south London, whose husband, Gary, died in November, said she had not received important documents involving the administration of his affairs because of postal delays in her neighbourhood. She said although postal workers were doing a “remarkable job” in difficult circumstances, there was just one postal delivery in her neighbourhood between Christmas Eve and last Monday. “I’m still getting condolence cards and I’m still getting Christmas cards,” she said last week. “A lot of them are not postmarked.” Helen Hayes, the Labour MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, has highlighted the continuing postal delays in her constituency after the closure of a main postal depot without consultation in East Dulwich in south-east London in 2018. She said: “There is no criticism of frontline postal workers, who have been really brave, but there is no slack in the system. There are important documents being delayed, death certificates going missing and people getting into a mess with their bills.” She said the Royal Mail should be required to publish performance data by individual postcode districts and introduce public consultations for proposed closures of mail depots. Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary (postal) of the Communication Workers Union, said only a minority of offices had experienced backlogs, but more resources were required in those areas. He said: “There clearly have been problems and they need to be sorted out. It’s unacceptable where offices have been failing for a number of weeks and the resources haven’t been put in place.” A Royal Mail spokesperson said the number of affected areas had been reduced over the past week. He said it was providing targeted support for the affected areas and was continuing to make significant investment in the business to transform the operation. The spokesperson said: “Our postmen and women are continuing to work incredibly hard, as they have done throughout the pandemic, and we are thankful for all of their efforts and determination.” The spokesperson added that the company tried to keep the price of stamps as low as possible, but needed to ensure there were sufficient funds for investment.",News/Business,Why am I getting Christmas cards in January?

1/16/2022,"Nick Blackburn began writing what would eventually become this, his first book, in 2017, in an office at Macclesfield hospital. That afternoon his father had died suddenly; while his mother signed some papers and was given back the plastic bag she’d used to bring her husband his pyjamas, he tapped out on his phone a thought about how, in death, “one dances”: an elusive notion that may have been stirred, he later realised, by an image from Ingmar Bergman’s 1957 film, The Seventh Seal, which is set in a Sweden ravaged by plague. The lines in question can be found, seemingly unedited, on page 28 of The Reactor; I know this because their author tells us of their Cheshire beginnings, and of what inspired them, on page 29. Blackburn, a therapist who specialises in LGBTQ+ issues, is always making the reader aware of the precise circumstances in which he wrote this or that part of his memoir; also, of the scepticism of his partner, James, over his habit of writing on the tube and other unlikely places, a practice that while producing plenty of shards, results in no coherent whole (“James says there’s nothing the miners’ strike and Chernobyl have in common”). Could it be that by pointing out the flimsy construction of his book himself, he hopes to encourage the reader not to think any more about it? To believe that its makeshift, provisional nature is the result of creative decision rather than, as it sometimes seemed to me, the result of creative failure?Blackburn’s central conceit is that grief and a variety of things related to nuclear meltdown might be comparable. Grief and radiation are, for instance, both invisible, while his father’s end had, he thinks, commonalities with the disaster at Chernobyl, an event with which he’s fascinated: the hospital, in age and size, was not unlike a Soviet power station; his father’s system, like that of a victim of radiation, was poisoned (a build-up of calcium in his brain). But this description gives no sense of Blackburn’s narrative as it appears on the page.  The clue is in the title. The Reactor is, in essence, an extended chain reaction, one thought – however fleeting, however partial; mostly, there are barely more than a dozen lines to the page – leading to another, and on and on, until the moment when its author at last looks ahead to a future in which his father’s ashes, having too long been stowed in the garage, will be scattered. Alderley Edge and Fukushima, Alexander McQueen and Rachel Carson, Audrey Roberts (of Coronation Street) and Ivor the Engine. Everything’s connected, you see. On The Reactor’s jacket, someone praises this “bricolage” for its beauty and mystery. Bricolage is a lovely, distracting word; it makes me think of that genius Robert Rauschenberg. All the same, I can’t be tempted. I want to be kind, but I also think there’s no point in being less than truthful. The Reactor doesn’t read like “a book about grief and recovery”, but like notes towards a book about grief and recovery. In spite of Blackburn’s obvious wisdom and his occasional flashes of writerly brilliance (“a man’s knuckles on the morning tube, draped over his bag like one of Dalí’s melting clocks”), it is not, in my eyes, ready. It is an approximation of something; a series of workings-out for which we still await a solution. Like a commonplace book, it also relies too heavily on quotation; the thoughts of others. Why, I wonder, did no agent or editor see this? But I think I know the answer. Whether fortunately or unfortunately for Blackburn, The Reactor is paradigmatic of literary publishing’s current fad for barely-there books: brief, wilfully minimalistic volumes whose editors are clearly labouring under the illusion that they are (or, to be more accurate, might be) as brilliant and as dazzling as, say, Jenny Offill’s Dept of Speculation. It comes of nervousness, I think: a fear of pointing out that the emperor, though not exactly naked, has only managed so far to pull on his vest and pants. (What if this prose is, er, poetry? What if this slip of a book is the next Grief Is the Thing With Feathers?) But never mind! Here I am, my index finger cocked like a gun, to tell you that such gnomic morsels, however bewitching at moments, do not always a good and complete book make.

1/16/2022,"Scottish Tories standing up and reviling their English leader? The gundog snarling and refusing to go fetch the rabbit? Astonishment at this sudden outburst of rage against Boris Johnson is understandable. At Holyrood and Westminster, Scottish Conservatives have been notorious for dumbly following their party bosses. But now they want Boris out. Douglas Ross, the Scottish leader, demands it. So, her face clenched with fury, does Ruth Davidson, a predecessor. So do almost all the 31 Tory MSPs in Edinburgh and most of the six MPs at Westminster. And – something unheard of – a prime minister has been refused leave to speak at his own party’s Scottish conference.  Rival politicians are sarcastic. “Why now? What kept you?” But that’s unfair. Under the obedient surface, Scottish Tories have been arguing and anxious resentment has been building for years. The latest tide of anti-Tory feeling – Johnson was rated at 80% disapproval even before the current scandal – threatens the party with near-obliteration at the next Scottish parliament elections in 2026. The party’s reputation has still not recovered from Scotland’s exposure to Margaret Thatcher, more than 30 years ago. Seen as the archetypal bossy Englishwoman, she is blamed, not always fairly, for the collapse of Scotland’s industrial and mining base that gave so many Scots work and meaning. This is why Jacob Rees-Mogg’s sneer at Ross last week – “lightweight” – hit the wrong spot with fatal accuracy. That tone again! That contemptuous arrogance! That particular… well, Englishness! For a crazy split second, thousands of Scots who would never dream of voting for a Tory became Douglas Ross. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist party has 31 seats in the Scottish parliament, making it the largest opposition group (the governing SNP has 64). This is thanks to Scotland’s proportional voting system that, ironically, the Tories fiercely opposed; if first past the post still operated, they would have only five seats. The party’s performance at Holyrood has been uninspiring, loud in denunciation of SNP governments but pretty barren of new ideas. And yet the Tories, like the other unionist opposition parties, are tormented over their links to London. Scottish Labour still shudders at the words of Johann Lamont, a previous leader, when she exploded a few years ago against being treated as a “branch office”. Money, senior appointments and policy are decided in London, not Glasgow. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have more autonomy but even less influence on their Westminster party. For the Scottish Tories, the union has traditionally been sacred. But a string of electoral defeats, as the whole landscape and language of Scottish politics diverged from the “British” model in the late 20th century, shook that confidence. More than 10 years ago, Murdo Fraser, one of the party’s few original minds, suggested that the party should break with central office in London, find a new name and operate as an independent force, while still loyal to the union. At the time, Fraser was squashed by Davidson, who took over the Scottish leadership, apparently comfortable with its “branch office” status. Now things look different. There have been upheavals before, as in the 1970s, when a minority fought in vain to soothe Thatcher’s hostility to any form of political devolution. But to see the party almost unanimous in demanding that a British prime minister be sacked – this is utterly new. Until 1965, this was the Scottish Unionist party. The “Conservative” label was only tacked on as the Scottish Tories, once dominant, entered steep decline. Now the Johnson crisis challenges them to choose: are they more unionist than Conservative? Or vice versa: could they conceive of themselves as an independent rightwing party in a sovereign or quasi-confederal Scottish state? The “Unionist” title referred to Ireland and the venerable rows over home rule, not to the 1707 Anglo-Scottish union. In the 20th century, Scotland’s Tories were perceived partly in sectarian terms: thousands of working-class Scots voted Tory to express their Protestant loyalty and keep down the Catholic, mostly Irish, minority. Supporters were content with a generally patrician leadership, a “colonelocracy” often educated at English public schools and deeply committed to crown, empire and the proud warrior legend of the “Scottish soldier”. Almost all of that is history now. “Unionism” means the United Kingdom, the defence of a new sort of unifying “British” identity that sounds ancient but is in fact quite recent and rather frail. It’s an ideology that is shared by all the “British” parties in Scotland to different degrees, but expressed most forcefully by the Tories. In the last few years, however, unionism has begun to be infiltrated by rightwing extremism, by groups less interested in constitutions than in conspiracy theories (‘“SNP fascism”), anti-vaxx protests and venomous misogyny directed at Nicola Sturgeon. The demography of Scottish conservatism has changed too. The patricians and great landowners have almost all departed from the leadership, while the religious element is draining out of politics. The party is represented today by more plebeian men and women, educated in Scottish schools. Its most solid support is now regional – mainly the range of rural constituencies along the English border and in the north-east – rather than class based. The late Teddy Taylor MP, populist and maverick, tried to persuade his party that Glasgow’s large Asian minority could be recruited as naturally bourgeois, but Labour and the SNP got there first. Yet the biggest change of all, the rise of political nationalism and cultural self-confidence, has unfairly landed the Tories with public perception as “the English party”, just as the party’s activists have left southern “poshness” behind them. Which way will the Scottish Conservatives turn now? The tantalising fact is that Scotland is in many ways a “conservative” – with a small c – society. The SNP’s faith that the Scots are naturally social-democratic is questioned by widespread values that are often repressive rather than liberal. “Who d’ye think you are – the queen of Sheba?” In an independent Scotland, or at least as an independent organisation cut loose from London, a centre-right conservative party could expect a very healthy future.

This was Josh’s Chocolate, which I found on a freezing day in a shop called Join in Clare, Suffolk, although the company is Cornish. There were beautifully packaged giant chocolate buttons, £4.60 (145g), but it was the bars that got me. Stunningly illustrated by Joanne Barry (shout out to the artists!), paper-jacketed and with names such as Weekends on the Water (milk chocolate with Cornish sea salt and caramel), A Ramble in the Woods (milk chocolate with blueberry and hazelnut), and A Stroll Along the Harbour (milk, cranberry, almond, cinnamon). But the one that spoke to me, as my nose reddened with the warmth of the shop vs the cold outside, was Friends by the Fire, 55% dark with little chunks of ginger, illustrated with a picture of friends, indeed, sitting by a wood burner, ignoring its carcinogenic effects.  This isn’t single-origin craft chocolate, but it’s very nice at £3.95 a bar (100g), and various other permutations are available, plus hot chocolate spoons (a chunk of chocolate on the end of a lolly stick to dunk into warm milk). It’s like a card and a chocolate in one and a few bars of this would make a lovely present to cheer up someone’s January.

1/16/2022,"Before Free Britney there was Free Earl, the 2010 movement to “liberate” the then 16-year-old US rapper Earl Sweatshirt from a reform school in Samoa to which his law professor mother had sent him, alarmed at his drug use. Since Sweatshirt’s graphic start as part of fellow enfants terribles Odd Future, the MC born Thebe Kgositsile has grown into one of hip-hop’s least obvious talents, rejecting mainstream rap tropes while grappling with his own introversion – he made an LP called I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside – and episodes of loss. Some Rap Songs (2018) reeled at the death of his estranged father, South African poet laureate Keorapetse Kgositsile – a dense, muzzy work delivered at speed, at an angle. Sick! emerges with musicality enhanced, full of strings, soul samples, arpeggiating pianos and vinyl crackle – sometimes, as on the immersive Vision and Tabula Rasa, all at once. More extroverted than previously, Sick! feels like a reset, harking back – there’s a great track called 2010 – then addressing the pandemic (and, on the grimey Titanic, maybe drugs as well) from the point of view of an artist who has famously reconciled with his mother, become a father himself and become more engaged with the “gorgeous” world outside his door.

1/16/2022,"If you thought Novak Djokovic had a God complex, he’s got nothing on Australia’s immigration minister. After the government suffered the ignominy of wounding, not killing, Djokovic on his arrival in Melbourne for the Australian Open a week ago, the immigration minister Alex Hawke was determined to stop the GOAT.  Armed with the almost bullet-proof section 133C(3) of the Migration Act, which gives the minister the power to cancel a person’s visa if satisfied it is in the public interest to do so, Hawke proceeded with the nuclear option of booting the world No 1 tennis player out of the country. The law is clear – the rules of natural justice don’t apply. Sunday’s federal court hearing did not need to consider the merits or wisdom of Hawke’s decision – just whether it was “irrational or legally unreasonable”. In a unanimous decision, the court found it was not, dismissing Djokovic’s appeal and ordering he pay costs. It was a messy week for the government, but the outcome proves once more that Australia’s immigration laws are as harsh in design as they are in execution. (Just ask Mehdi Ali, who has spent nine years in detention as a result of Australia’s border policies.) In the court hearing, the government had argued Djokovic was “perceived by some as a talisman of a community of anti-vaccine sentiment” and allowing him to stay in the country could undermine the government’s public health messaging. In essence, Djokovic had become a poster boy for anti-vax views – it was likened to a sponsorship deal – and his very presence would serve as a country-wide advertisement for others to follow suit. Australia’s new hardline no-dickhead approach was accepted by the court and Djokovic’s fate was sealed. He won’t be missed by most, with the tennis world’s most unsympathetic protagonist doing little for his cause by confirming he defied health advice for a photo opportunity after testing positive to Covid, and then incorrectly filled in his immigration paperwork. Even among the tennis community he has received little sympathy, with the saga (triggered, let’s not forget, by Djokovic’s decision not to get vaccinated) overshadowing the Australian Open, where other vaccinated players just want to get on with the tennis. But if being arrogant, anti-science and an all-round jerk is grounds for the government to push the button on its extraordinary deportation powers, then perhaps we can look forward to the government doing more about similar characters domestically. Has Alex Hawke chewed the fat with Alex Antic or George Christensen in the Coalition party room lately? They make Djokovic look like a veritable quiet Australian, what with their calls for civil unrest, and suggestions state health departments are involved in grand cover-up conspiracies. Queensland LNP senator Gerard Rennick is publicly questioning the safety of booster shots and has suggested the health department of having a “callous attitude towards the safety of Australians”, while Nationals senator Matt Canavan has continually downplayed the threat of the virus compared to the threat to personal liberty. The poor old Therapeutic Goods Administration has been pulling its hair out in frustration over the well-funded Clive Palmer misinformation campaign, which gets met with an official shrugging of shoulders when asked if the government can do anything about it. If only Palmer and Craig Kelly were non-citizens! Government ministers themselves have been keen to dog-whistle to anti-vax sentiment, distancing themselves from controversial vaccine mandates when politically expedient to do so, and tacitly supporting freedom rallies that have targeted health restrictions. The handling of the Djokovic case has been a rolling administrative shambles, and Australians who have done the right thing and got vaccinated – many who would have preferred not to – overwhelmingly think the Joker should go home. But anyone who suggests the government is being driven by its fervent belief in good health and public order, and not by a desire for a much-needed political win in its strong suit of border control, has not been paying attention.",News/Australia news,Imagine if Australia applied its new no-dickhead policy on Novak Djokovic to government troublemakers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/imagine-if-australia-applied-its-new-no-dickhead-policy-on-novak-djokovic-to-government-troublemakers
1/16/2022,"For bitcoin enthusiasts in Kosovo with a breezy attitude to risk, it has been a good week to strike a deal on computer equipment that can create, or “mine”, the cryptocurrency. From Facebook to Telegram, new posts in the region’s online crypto groups became dominated by dismayed Kosovans attempting to sell off their mining equipment – often at knockdown prices.  “There’s a lot of panic and they’re selling it or trying to move it to neighbouring countries,” said cryptoKapo, a crypto investor and administrator of some of the region’s largest online crypto communities. The frenetic social media action follows an end-of-year announcement by Kosovo’s government of an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on all crypto mining activity as part of emergency measures to ease a crippling energy crisis. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or “mined” by high-powered computers that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in what is a highly energy-intensive process that rewards people based on the amount of computing power they provide. The incentive to get into the mining game in Kosovo, one of Europe’s poorest countries, is obvious. The cryptocurrency currently trades at more than £31,500 a bitcoin, while Kosovo has the cheapest energy prices in Europe due in part to more than 90% of the domestic energy production coming from burning the country’s rich reserves of lignite, a low-grade coal, and fuel bills being subsidised by the government. The largest-scale crypto mining is thought to be taking place in the north of the country, where the Serb-majority population refuse to recognise Kosovo as an independent state and have consequently not paid for electricity for more than two decades. There is serious money to be made – and in a time of ready energy supply it was being made. The number of people mining cryptocurrencies in Kosovo is thought to have skyrocketed in recent years. Groups such as Albanian Crypto Amateurs on Facebook and Crypto Eagles on Telegram have exploded with thousands of new members, though it is unclear how many are mining cryptocurrency, or on what scale. But the good times appear to be over – at least for now – and the developments in Kosovo highlight one of the big questions about the future of bitcoin and other such digital currency. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that global bitcoin mining consumes 125.96 terawatt hours a year of electricity, putting its consumption above Norway (122.2 TWh), Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh). Meanwhile, Kosovans spent the final days of 2021 in darkness as domestic and international factors combined to cause energy shortages and rolling blackouts across the country. At the peak of the recent crisis, an unforeseen shutdown at one of its two ageing power plants left Kosovo importing about 40% of its energy on international markets – where prices have soared – and the government was forced to provide an emergency subsidy to help meet the costs. Kosovo’s minister of economy, Dr Artane Rizvanolli, said the ban had been a “no-brainer”. “We have allocated €20m for subsidising energy, which is probably not going to be sufficient, and this is taxpayers’ money that is going to subsidise electricity consumption,” she said. “On the other hand we have crypto mining, which is a highly energy-intensive activity and is not regulated.” Kosovo is not alone. Last September, the 10 most powerful regulators in China vowed to kill off what was then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency mining industry. In Iceland, the country’s national power company, Landsvirkjun, has said it will turn away potential cryptocurrency miners as the country is experiencing power shortages. Last week, a powerful committee in the US Congress announced it would convene a hearing on the issue. US cryptocurrency miners are believed to be the largest consumers of energy, followed by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. “It’s time to understand and address the steep energy and environmental impacts it is having on our communities and our planet,” said committee chairman Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette, who heads its oversight panel. Alex de Vries, a Paris-based economist, said his initial estimates in a paper to be published later this year suggest just a quarter of the energy used by miners is renewable: “The question really is: what are you getting in return for that?” Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, said he believed there were a host of advantages, including the offer of instant, virtually free, financial transactions carried out without the use of a third party, with certainty that there will be instant settlement, and that the current teething problems need to be put in perspective. Since the Kosovan authorities made the decision, police and customs officers have begun conducting regular raids, seizing hundreds of pieces of hardware. While a 60-day state of energy emergency remains in place, the prospect of upcoming regulation and energy bill price rises leaves the future anything but certain. “There are a lot of people who have invested in crypto mining equipment and it’s not a small investment,” cryptoKapo said. “People have even taken out loans to invest and the impact now is very bad on their lives.”",News/Technology,Panic as Kosovo pulls the plug on its energy-guzzling bitcoin miners ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/16/panic-as-kosovo-pulls-the-plug-on-its-energy-guzzling-bitcoin-miners
1/16/2022,"The defenestration of a prime minister between elections is usually triggered by a seismic event. Neville Chamberlain was forced out after Norway was gobbled up by Hitler. The national humiliation of the Suez debacle did for Anthony Eden. The epic unpopularity of the riot-provoking poll tax impelled Margaret Thatcher towards her unwilling exit. David Cameron felt compelled to quit when he lost his gamble on the Brexit referendum. If Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson soon joins the gallery of toppled PMs, it will be because he attended a “bring your own booze” party in the back garden of Number 10 and his aides had a lockdown-busting piss-up in Downing Street the night before the Queen buried her husband. No other premiership has had such a pathetically shabby ending. No finale to his slummy reign would be more appropriate. It has always been highly likely that cavalier and blatant rule-breaking, and then lying about it, would be the undoing of a prime minister with a career history of casual contempt for truth and integrity.  In its relatively short life, his premiership has been splattered with scandal. There was the “crony express” that sped lucrative Covid contracts to Tory mates down a “VIP lane”, which the high court has just ruled unlawful. There was the decanting of infected elderly patients from hospitals into vulnerable care homes at the height of the pandemic. Nor should we forget the multiple-sourced accounts that Mr Johnson callously declared that he would let the bodies “pile high in their thousands” in the winter of last year rather than take timely action to contain a resurgence of Covid, an appalling choice that resulted in many avoidable fatalities and has left Britain with the highest death toll in Europe. These and other outrages ought to have deeply troubled Tories, but many in his parliamentary party responded to scandal after scandal with a dismissive shrug. Conservative MPs now profess their shock-horror at the torrent of revelations about booze-ups at Number 10, but few expressed concern about earlier disgraces when it didn’t appear to be costing them support. Never mind the quality of the prime minister’s ethics, so they responded, feel the width of our poll rating. When previous charges of moral turpitude bounced off him, Tories told themselves that their leader was coated with a lacquer of Teflon so thick that nothing could stick. Some cynically opined that voters knew that Mr Johnson was a mendacious scoundrel when he won the election in 2019 and so appalling behaviour was expected and – ghastly phrase – “in the price”. It was often averred that a substantial chunk of the public enjoyed having a “lovable rogue” at Number 10. “Everyone loves a sinner.” So one senior Tory chortled to me last autumn when his party was still sitting on a poll lead even as Wallpapergate and several other scandals were on the boil. He went on: “If Boris was caught shagging a goat in Downing Street, people would immediately make a goat beer and drink to his health.” That senior Tory has had a sobering change of mind. He now thinks that Number 10 has generated a scandal so disgusting to the public that it will be terminal even for such a legendary escapologist. “Is Boris toast? Yes, he is toast. He’s lost the armour that used to protect him from the normal rules of political gravity. That’s evaporated. It’s definitely over. The question is when.” Another former cabinet minister agrees: “The Teflon is all gone. The odds of him taking us into the next election are very low – in fact, near-zero.” A third Tory MP, previously a fervent admirer, says: “I think it’s over. I simply can’t see a way back from this.” Here we have a scandal that even the great trickster can’t blag his way out of. The half-confession he finally made to the Commons last week failed to defuse the outrage because it was extracted only under intense pressure and after weeks of false denials. His attempt to sound contrite didn’t work because it was a non-apology apology so reeking with insincerity that it added insult to the injury felt by the many who have been bereaved by the pandemic. Everyone knows that the only thing he is genuinely sorry about is getting caught. Everyone also knows this: while large numbers were dying, often without the comfort of loved ones, and millions were making sacrifices to support what their government told them was a collective endeavour to control the pandemic, Mr Johnson’s Downing Street was on a booze cruise. It is hard to say which is the more jaw-dropping. The flagrancy of the rule-breaking. The arrogant stupidity of it. Or the stunning frequency with which the denizens of Number 10 behaved as if laws did not apply to them. The prime minister’s feeble plea in mitigation for the garden party that he admits to attending is that he thought it was a “work event”. This laughable excuse asks us to believe that he failed to notice that alcohol was flowing and that his wife and her chums were present. He had to fall back on such a risible defence because the alternative is to confess that he flouted his government’s regulations and afterwards sought to dupe the public and deceive parliament. We have learned that the many shindigs at Downing Street included parties the night before a grieving Queen sat alone at Prince Philip’s funeral and at a time when any indoor socialising was prohibited. Witnesses say that one staffer went off to the Co-op in the Strand to load up an empty suitcase with wine and beer, an aide played a DJ set in the Number 10 basement and a swing belonging to the prime minister’s son was broken by an inebriated party animal. On Mr Johnson’s watch, during the most severe pandemic in more than a century and on the eve of the burial of the monarch’s consort, Number 10 was turned into a nightclub. One Conservative MP says that this revelation has caused “the most profound abhorrence” in his patch, especially among true blue types. Another Tory MP reports that party members who were once fanatical Johnson devotees are spitting: “You’ve got to get rid of him.” Even if he was not physically present for all the parties, he was at every one in spirit. What possessed Number 10 staffers to think that it was sensible or decent to turn Downing Street into a drinking den while people were dying? As I like to remark from time to time, the culture of organisations is greatly shaped by the character of the person at the top. The most egregious rule-breaking became habitual at Number 10 and that is surely directly connected to the fact that the most senior person in the building is a compulsively shameless rule-trasher. “Fish stink from the head,” remarks one former Tory cabinet minister. “So does Number 10.” A growing number of Tory backbenchers think he should go, as do quite a lot of ministers, including some of the cabinet who are professing insincere loyalty oaths. Making things even darker for the prime minister, the Opinium poll we publish today indicates that he is shedding even his core support. Nearly half of those who supported Brexit in 2016 and then the Tories in 2019 say he should be out of Downing Street. What is lacking for now is a settled consensus among Tory MPs about when to remove him and who to replace him with. Many have congregated around the idea that the May elections, when voters go to the polls across the UK, will be the litmus test. This is a cop-out from their moral responsibilities. If he is a disgrace to the high office he holds, he is a disgrace whether the voters fiercely punish the government at the ballot box or the Tories improve on their terrible ratings. Truth to tell, most Conservative MPs are exercised by this scandal because it makes them fearful of losing power, not because of what it says about the prime minister’s ethical character. They never thought Mr Johnson was a man of sparkling integrity who would make a fine prime minister. They knew who he was. They made him their leader because they thought that winning is all that matters in politics and he looked like a winner. Far too many people in the Tory party chose to ignore his unfitness to be prime minister. If they had bothered themselves with that question before, they wouldn’t have put him in Number 10 in the first place, nor shrugged so cynically at all the squalor that has ineluctably followed.
