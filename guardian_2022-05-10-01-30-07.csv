5/10/2022,"The squeeze on British households from high inflation could be bigger and last longer than expected, amid a series of economic shocks from Brexit, Covid and Russia’s war in Ukraine, economists have warned. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said inflation was “uncomfortably high” as households come under pressure from soaring energy, food and fuel bills. The independent economist, who voted for a bigger rise in borrowing costs last week than most of his MPC colleagues, said he was concerned that expectations for higher inflation could become entrenched for longer than hoped. “Energy price squeezes are painful. They hit those on the lowest incomes worst,” he said. His warning was echoed by Andy Haldane, the Bank’s former chief economist who now leads the Royal Society for Arts thinktank, who said high rates of inflation could stick around for “years rather than months”. Haldane, who was among the most prominent economists to sound the alarm on inflation risks before he quit the Bank last year, told LBC radio station that he wished tougher action had been taken sooner. Asked if inflation could rise above 10% or go even higher, he said: “It could. I fear it might … I’m slightly fearful, it might stick around for some little while as well. This won’t be come and gone in a matter of months. I think this could be years rather than months.” Threadneedle Street raised its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a 13-year high of 1% last week to combat soaring inflation, despite warning there were growing risks of a recession caused by the cost of living crisis. The Bank said the measure for the annual rise in living costs could breach 10% later this year, but then was likely to fall back towards its 2% target within three years’ time as the economic shocks from Covid and the war in Ukraine gradually fade. Saunders, who alongside two other members of the nine-strong MPC was in the minority calling for a tougher 0.5 percentage point rate rise, said it would be better to ramp up borrowing costs more aggressively now to stop persistently high rates of inflation in future. “I put considerable weight on risks that, unless checked by monetary policy, domestic capacity and inflation pressures would probably be greater and more persistent than the central forecast,” he said in a speech at the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Such a plan could help avoid more aggressive hikes to hit the 2% target in future, which “could be very costly in economic terms,” he said. Saunders, who is due to step down from the MPC in August, said Britain’s economy was suffering from “a series of major shocks” from Brexit, the Covid pandemic and soaring energy prices, alongside longer-term effects from an ageing population. Shortages of workers and a lack of business investment could have been exacerbated by leaving the EU, he said, at a time when a mismatch between supply and demand in the jobs market was forcing employers to raise workers’ pay. “Costs relating to Brexit appear to have played some role, although this effect has recently diminished as one-off cost increases start to drop out of the annual comparison,” he said. Driven by unemployment at the lowest level in 40 years and record job vacancies, Threadneedle Street forecasts average wage growth will come close to 6% this year. However, this remains significantly below inflation, adding to pressure on workers, while average pay settlements are expected to fall back next year. Haldane, who served as the head of Boris Johnson’s levelling up taskforce for six months between leaving the Bank and joining the RSA this spring, said there was a “better than evens chance” that Britain’s economy would fall into recession. “We could find ourselves heading south rather than north,” he added.",News/Business,"High UK inflation could last for ‘years rather than months’, warns economist",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/09/high-uk-inflation-could-last-for-years-rather-than-months-warns-economist
5/10/2022,"The potentially career-ending video of Keir Starmer drinking a beer in Durham was filmed by Ivo Delingpole, the student son of the Breitbart writer James Delingpole. Delingpole, who graduated from the University of Durham last year, was at his student house in the city, close to a venue where the Labour leader held a political campaign event on 30 April 2021. According to individuals with knowledge of the video’s creation, it was Delingpole who spotted the Labour leader through the window of Durham Miners Hall. Starmer was drinking with a team of campaigners eating a takeaway curry at a time when the country was still under partial lockdown and large indoor social gatherings were banned. The short video was subsequently passed to the anti-lockdown activist Laurence Fox, who tweeted it out to his followers. Mainstream media outlets largely ignored the footage for nine months, but as public fury over parties in Downing Street escalated over the winter the Daily Mail put the Starmer video on its front page in January and accused the Labour leader of hypocrisy. The newspaper, along with the Sun and the Telegraph, has since led a concerted campaign to investigate the circumstances surrounding the video, resulting in an announcement from Durham police that the force would launch an investigation into whether Starmer and his fellow campaigners broke lockdown rules. Ivo Delingpole could not be reached for comment, but his father confirmed he had been the individual who filmed the footage. Ivo has insisted in anonymous interviews with the student newspaper Palatinate that he did not want the footage to be used to excuse Boris Johnson’s rule breaking and that his decision to film had not been politically motivated. James Delingpole was an Oxford university contemporary of Johnson’s in the 1980s. He has written for the right-wing Breitbart and other outlets such as the Spectator and the Telegraph. He hosted a live edition of his podcast last month with a number of anti-lockdown activists, including Fox. When the video of Starmer first circulated last April, he tweeted about it without mentioning that his son had filmed it. “Literally no one would care whether or not Keir Starmer broke mask/social distancing regulations if it weren’t for the fact that he has pushed for them even more assiduously than the government. It’s about grotesque double standards. How is this point not obvious?” he wrote. Starmer said on Monday that he would resign as Labour leader if Durham police fined him over the incident, insisting he acted within the law.",News/Politics,Revealed: student who shot Beergate video that threatens to sink Starmer,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/revealed-student-ivo-delingpole-james-breitbart-beergate-video-that-threatens-to-sink-starmer

5/10/2022,"The US baby formula shortage is leaving manufacturers scrambling and parents in desperation. During the week starting 24 April, 40% of baby formula was out of stock in more than 11,000 stores across the country, CNN and USA Today reported, compared to an out-of-stock percentage of 2 to 8% during the first half of 2021. In six states – Texas, Tennessee, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Missouri – more than half of available baby formula in stores was sold out during the week of 24 April, according to CNN and USA Today, citing information from the website Datasembly. Amid fears of formula stockpiling, several major retailers, including Walgreens and CVS, have placed limits on how much formula parents can buy at a time. Experts say that strained baby formula supplies were further exacerbated after a recall by the manufacturer Abbott Nutrition. In February, Abbott voluntarily recalled three of its products after reports of illness among infant consumers, including two who died. The Abbott recall particularly afflicted families who rely on public benefits such as WIC – a special supplemental food program for low-income women and children – because the manufacturer was the exclusive supplier for more than half of the agencies administering WIC, Brian Dittmeier of the National WIC Association told the New York Times. Now, parents who are desperate to secure a regular supply of baby formula for their children are having increased difficulty obtaining a single can. Many parents have been relying on social media groups to stay abreast of inventory restocks and possible bargains. The groups have been particularly useful for parents whose children require certain types of formulas due to allergies or other medical issues. Particularly in areas with low supply, parents have been forced to travel to neighboring states just to see if any formula is available there. “It’s a nightmare,” Ashley Hernandez, a mother of two, said to the Times. Hernandez has been procuring formula for her two girls from eBay, frantically messaging potential sellers about her requests. As the scarcity intensifies, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a statement saying it was aware of supply issues that the Abbott recall had aggravated, especially when coupled with shortages stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic. “The FDA is working with Abbott Nutrition to better assess the impacts of the recall and understand the production capacity at other Abbott facilities that produce some of the impacted brands,” the FDA said in a statement. Other baby formula suppliers have said they are adjusting their operations to meet the increased demand created by the Abbott recall. For example, the manufacturer of the Enfamil infant formula told USA Today that its factories are running 24/7 and shipped out 30% more of its formula during its first quarter of the year. But as supply chain issues worsen and store shelves remain empty of formula, parents of infants are growing more uncertain about how to feed their babies. “Every day, we hear from parents who are hurt, angry, anxious and scared,” Dittmeier, of the National WIC Association, said to the Times. “The lives of their infants are on the line.”",News/US news,‘It’s a nightmare’: baby formula shortage leaves US parents desperate,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/baby-formula-shortage-abbott
5/10/2022,"Payments of up to £60m to a future king of Saudi Arabia, his son and other high-ranking officials were approved by the British government as part of a huge arms deal and the UK then sought to conceal them in what it described as a “deniable fiddle”, a trial has heard. Opening the defence of one of two men accused of corruption in the arms deal, Ian Winter QC told Southwark crown court that some of the payments were made to the then Prince Abdullah, who later became the Saudi monarch for a decade. Winter also told the court that internal documents recorded that the British government and Abdullah organised “a deniable fiddle” to hide the payments. The QC also alleged that the British government ensured payments continued to be paid to high-ranking Saudis until 2020 – eight years after the Serious Fraud Office began an investigation into the same payments. Winter is representing Jeffrey Cook, 65, who, along with John Mason, 79, is being prosecuted by the SFO for authorising corrupt payments amounting to £7.9m to senior Saudis between 2007 and 2012. The payments were made, according to the SFO, to ensure that a British firm, GPT, received lucrative contracts from the Saudi military. Cook, a former Ministry of Defence civil servant, was GPT’s managing director. Mason worked for an offshore firm, Simec, that is accused of funnelling the bribes to the Saudis. The contracts awarded to GPT were part of a large arms deal managed as a formal agreement between the UK and Saudi governments that had started in the 1970s. Winter told the court the British government decided in 1978 that large payments had to be paid personally to Abdullah, then a prince, to ensure that the British won the original arms deal. This was a “fundamental necessity without which the contract would not have been awarded to the British”, he added. He said the British government “decided that it was in the public interest, bearing in mind the value of the … contract, to enter into a binding contractual agreement with Prince Abdullah” to be given the payments. He alleged that Abdullah and the MoD organised the original deal on the basis of what the MoD “called at the time, ‘the deniable fiddle’. They actually recorded that phrase in reports and file notes at the time.” Winter said “both Prince Abdullah and the British government wanted a deniable fiddle that would enable the payments to be made, but which would permit them to deny their involvement through the use of a private contractor”. In recent years, the role of private contractor had been performed by GPT. He said “very senior” officials in the British government approved every penny of the payments that were made as part of the arms deal in what at one stage was called “top cover”. This included the money paid to Abdullah, and more recently his son Prince Miteb, and other high-ranking officials. Abdullah died in 2015 after 10 years on the Saudi throne. He alleged that the UK government facilitated the payments amounting to £60m to be made from the late 1970s to 2020, when GPT’s contracts ended. The SFO began its investigation into GPT in 2012 after complaints from whistleblowers. Winter told Mr Justice Bryan that “even after the prosecution’s balloon had gone up … the MoD set about working on creating a new system that did not involve GPT having to make the” payments to senior Saudis. He alleged that the payments were moved through an offshore route by the MoD. He added that legally, the payments did not amount to corruption if the Saudi and British governments had authorised them. The trial continues.",News/UK news,"UK used ‘deniable fiddle’ to hide £60m of payments to Saudis, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/uk-deniable-fiddle-hide-60m-payments-saudis-court-told
5/10/2022,"The grim accusation about men – the one about them being all alike – might occur to you during this film, along perhaps with the shrill defensive hashtag #notallmen. It is an unsubtle and schematic but very well-acted Brit folk-horror pastiche from the writer-director Alex Garland; it feels like a reverse-engineered version of The League of Gentlemen, with the overt comic intention concealed or denied. For me, the film never quite addresses the obvious dramatic implications of its startling central conceit: the wacky multirole casting of Rory Kinnear. But there’s undoubtedly something unnerving and outrageous in Kinnear’s performances, with the wigs and false teeth, like a scary-movie remake of The Dick Emery Show. The setting is a picture-perfect Hertfordshire village with a sumptuously restored Elizabethan manor house, which is being let as an Airbnb. Harper (played by the reliably excellent Jessie Buckley) is an unhappy young woman getting over a tragic event in her life in the time-honoured fashion of movies ranging from Don’t Look Now to Midsommar. Her trauma is related to her partner (Paapa Essiedu) who was disturbed, abusive and passive-aggressive. Now she has come to this place for rest and healing. The landlord is a curious fellow: a Barbour-and-red-trousers type who appears to tell Harper off for eating one of the apples from the tree in the front garden – and then with a mirthless smile assures her that he is joking. On a walk the next day, Harper sees a naked man in the distance, like an Antony Gormley statue, who follows her home and has to be arrested by two police officers when she dials 999. The publican doesn’t seem particularly sympathetic when she stops by later for a drink, and neither does the arresting officer who has come in for a drink himself (in uniform). And when Harper visits the local church for solace, she is confronted by a creepy, sweary kid and a thin-lipped priest who, having encouraged Harper to confide her woes, implies that they are all her fault. These men are all played by Rory Kinnear, differentiated with skill and technique. But the audience are entitled to ask: why doesn’t Harper notice or comment on the fact that they all look exactly alike? Is it because, numbed by grief, she doesn’t see it? Or are they a sort of dream she is having, a PTSD hallucination caused by the treatment she has received from her partner? Are these men a D’Ascoyne family of misogyny, each villager a symptom of the same patriarchal dysfunction that infects all men, including her partner? Maybe. Her landlord sadly comments that as a seven-year-old, he was told by his father that he exhibited “the character of a failed military man”. I think the drama’s reality status could have been refined further at the script development stage, and there is a bat-squeak of not-entirely-intentional silliness in that moment when Harper last locks eyes with her partner. Yet the performances are so good, and there is a wonderful scene at the very beginning in which Harper tests the echo of an eerie abandoned rail tunnel by singing into it a series of notes, and hearing how they seem to reverberate for ever – a musical theme wittily reprised on the soundtrack, as the movie builds to its freaky finale.

5/10/2022,"Volkswagen’s chief executive, Herbert Diess, has admitted the pace of Tesla’s expansion took him by surprise, and the German carmaker may struggle to overtake its upstart US rival. Diess is leading the world’s second-largest carmaker on a rapid increase in electric vehicle sales, but he acknowledged VW may be unable to catch up with Tesla and that it would be a “tight race”. “We didn’t expect our main US competitor to be so fast,” he said, speaking via video link from Germany at a Financial Times car conference on Monday. “It will be tight but we won’t give up on it. I would still see a chance that by 2025 we are first. At least second.” Under Elon Musk, Tesla has become by far the world’s largest carmaker by stock market value at nearly $900bn (£729bn), compared with VW’s €89bn and delivered 936,000 cars in 2021. Of the 8.9m vehicles VW sold last year, 452,900 were pure electric. Toyota has been the world’s largest carmaker in sales terms for the last two years, but has decided to opt for a slower transition away from fossil fuels. The chief executives of Volkswagen and Tesla appear to share an unusually warm personal relationship, with Musk in 2020 test-driving one of VW’s ID.3 electric cars with Diess in Germany. In October, Musk joined a conference call of VW executives at the invitation of Diess to talk about how to speed up the transition to electric technology. With a new mindset & a revolution in our headquarter Wolfsburg we can succeed the new competition.Good meeting with 200 top managers in Alpbach. Big responsibility at a crucial point for our company. Thx for joining @ErinMeyerINSEAD & @elonmusk,we will visit you soon in Grünheide pic.twitter.com/dwYyXZnBT8 Tesla is rapidly ramping up production, with new factories in Texas and Berlin adding to existing facilities in California and Shanghai. How Musk manages that increase will be a key question for Tesla, said Diess, amid global supply chain issues, shortages of computer chips and disruption from the war in Ukraine. He said the first quarter of 2022 was “for sure dominated” by the shortage of semiconductors but added that there were signs of improving conditions in an issue that has dogged the industry’s recovery from the pandemic. “Even under these really difficult circumstances […] 22 could still be a good year for us and for the car industry,” he said. Despite aiming to be the world’s largest electric car manufacturer, Volkswagen is only aiming for 50% to 60% of its sales being fully electric vehicles by 2030. In comparison, traditional manufacturing rivals such as Volvo and General Motors are planning to only sell zero-emissions vehicles by 2030 and 2035 respectively. Diess said demand for electric cars was rising more quickly than anticipated across the world. In China, the company could have quadrupled sales in the first quarter had it been able to manufacturer vehicles quickly enough, he said. “We are sold out of electric cars because the demand is higher than we expected initially,” Diess said.",News/Business,VW boss admits speed of Tesla’s expansion surprised him,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/09/vw-boss-admits-speed-of-teslas-expansion-surprised-him-electric-cars-herbert-diess-elon-musk
5/10/2022,"Refugee children in London will be given a book each month until they turn five, thanks to a new project from Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. The global organisation is partnering with publisher Penguin Random House and charity Give a Book to offer books to 200 refugee children in the capital. Among the books chosen are old and new favourites such as Where is the Very Hungry Caterpillar? by Eric Carle, King Jack and the Dragon by Peter Bently and Billy and the Dragon by Nadia Shireen, who said she was “honoured” to have had her book chosen. “Children’s books are magical portals that can comfort, console and delight,” she added. “For families who have been through unimaginable upheaval, receiving a book to share may be a small thing, but it will hopefully also be a loving, warm and familiar thing.” Francesca Dow, managing director of children’s books at Penguin Random House, noted how “books are vital to building understanding, and creating a sense of belonging” that can be “crucial” for those moving to a new place. “What is especially exciting about these donations is that the children will be receiving new books every month,” she added. They will therefore “be able to build up their own personal collection of books to keep and to have, as they grow”. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, which was launched in 1995 and is the flagship programme of the Dollywood Foundation, gives a book a month to participating children until they turn five, at no cost to the child’s family. In 2021, more than 618,000 books were given to children across the UK and Ireland through the charity’s partnership with Penguin Random House. Marion Gillooly, executive director of the Dollywood Foundation UK, said: “Delivering books to these children every month will give them the opportunity to experience the joy of reading with their families. We hope that this will support family relationships and inspire a love of reading that will last a lifetime.”",Arts/Books,Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to give books to refugee children,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/09/dolly-parton-imagination-library-books-refugee-children
5/10/2022,"The casting of a new Doctor prompts speculation equalled only by that surrounding the appointment of a new England manager, or the next James Bond. This is in part because the choice is seen to say something about the country. Doctor Who is, in cliche, a “national institution”, a term first applied to it by the Radio Times as long ago as 1972. And the smart casting of Ncuti Gatwa to fill these boots is a sign that the showrunner, Russell T Davies, is determined it should remain an institution well into the 21st century. For while there are undeniably ways in which Gatwa’s casting is innovative, he is equally clearly a fine actor with a strong theatrical pedigree, someone known for showy supporting television roles, but not yet as an above-the-title star. Which is a sentence that also describes most of his predecessors. A new Doctor has been headline news for decades. Peter Davison, who played the role from 1981 to 1984, has often commented that his friends thought he had died when his picture flashed up on the BBC Nine O’Clock News in 1980. But the years since the series’ 2005 revival have seen announcements on an even grander scale. Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker’s castings were television events: they respectively had a special mini documentary, a live “reveal” show, and a trailer transmitted straight after the 2017 Wimbledon men’s final. This time it was different again. Bad Wolf, the production company responsible for the next series of Doctor Who, tweeted a picture of a post made by Gatwa to his almost 3 million Instagram followers. It consisted of two hearts and a blue box. This drove hours of online speculation on both sites before Bad Wolf confirmed that Gatwa would indeed be succeeding Whittaker. On the red carpet at the TV Baftas on Sunday, Davies, Gatwa by his side, stressed that his new lead was cast after a “blazing” audition, given when the production team had all but decided to offer the role to another actor entirely. To audition for a series lead is pretty normal for TV, but unusual for Doctor Who. Most Doctors, including Davies’ own previous two, have been people the then showrunner had already worked with. That Davies is doing something different indicates his approach to the show to which he’s returning: to innovate, to renew, to make a splash. Of course, in these depressing times, the negative reaction from some online, rightwing culture warriors came like clockwork. Those who attempted to criticise the decision to cast Gatwa without reference to his three Bafta nominations, and Bafta Scotland win, for Netflix’s Sex Education, merely demonstrated their own estrangement from the contemporary culture on which they were affecting expertise. The truth is that there is something joyfully affirmative about a role sometimes seen as an exemplar of Britishness being played by an actor who settled in Scotland as a child, having fled Rwanda, a country very much in the news due to recent government policy. (Davies took time to criticise the government’s attitude towards both Channel 4 and the BBC.) None of this is out of keeping with the history of Doctor Who. While the programme’s longevity makes it seem part of the establishment, its lead character topples governments and brings down empires as part of their crusade against monsters. One of 1970s’ Doctor Who’s most admired and frequent writers, Malcolm Hulke, was an activist with an MI5 file. In the 1980s, script editor Andrew Cartmel got the job after suggesting in his interview that Doctor Who was the ideal cultural vehicle to bring down Margaret Thatcher. Gatwa is the first black actor to play the role as a series lead. The black British actor Jo Martin has played the part, but not as the lead. Further back, Tom Baker’s father was a Jewish seaman, Davison’s a Guyanese engineer turned grocer. Interestingly, the role has been disproportionately played by Catholics, to the extent that Baker and Sylvester McCoy (1987-89) both trained for life within the church before becoming actors. There are peculiar patterns in the casting, such as how several actors who have played Winston Smith in Nineteen Eighty-Four have also played the Doctor. Maybe it’s something to do with the programme’s innate anti-authoritarianism. Perhaps the role’s mystical nature is why, as well as the aspiring clergymen mentioned above, it has been filled by two actors – David Tennant and Gatwa – whose fathers were ministers. There is certainly something in the series that appeals to those who are or have been marginalised, despite its centrality to British television culture. Davies made Vince, one of the leaders of his groundbreaking show Queer as Folk, a Doctor Who fan in acknowledgement of the overwhelmingly gay male nature of its then active fandom. But Doctor Who’s slightly penumbral relationship to the country it’s often considered to represent makes perfect sense. It was created by the Canadian Sydney Newman, and its first episode was written by an Australian, Anthony Coburn, produced by Verity Lambert, a Jewish woman, and directed by Waris Hussein, a gay Muslim born in Lucknow when India was still part of the British empire. Gatwa’s casting is revolutionary while also being precedented. But then that’s the paradoxical nature of Doctor Who. As the late Radio 1 DJ John Peel said of his favourite band, the Fall, it’s somehow always different and yet always the same.

5/10/2022,"Nick Cave has announced that his oldest son Jethro has died, aged 31. In a brief statement, he wrote: “With much sadness, I can confirm that my son, Jethro, has passed away. We would be grateful for family privacy at this time.” Jethro was born in 1991 to Nick and mother Beau Lazenby. Nick’s second son Luke was born 10 days after Jethro, to Nick’s first wife Viviane Carneiro; Jethro grew up in Australia and later said he didn’t meet Nick until he was seven or eight years old. “It was a difficult time, but it turned out great in the end,” Nick told a journalist in 2008. “To my eternal regret, I didn’t make much contact with Jethro in the early years, but I now have a great relationship with him.” Jethro said in a 2012 interview: “It didn’t start off that great, having all this shit with my dad and being in his shadow.” After moving to the UK as a young man, Jethro became a model, including for Balenciaga and Versace; Hedi Slimane, creative director of Celine, has photographed him. He also started his own music projects. In April, he was found guilty of unlawful assault, after he physically attacked his mother in March. His lawyer announced that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was jailed, and released last weekend. He was previously convicted of assault in 2018, against his then girlfriend. Cave has now suffered the death of two of his four sons, after his son Arthur died aged 15 after falling from a cliff near Brighton. In a statement announcing his death, he was described as a “beautiful, happy, loving boy”, and the impact of his death on Cave was explored in the documentary One More Time With Feeling, which focused on the making of the album Skeleton Tree.",Arts/Music,"Jethro Lazenby, son of Nick Cave, dies aged 31",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/09/jethro-lazenby-son-of-nick-cave-dies-aged-31
5/10/2022,"The Republican governor of Mississippi has refused to rule out attempting to ban some forms of contraception if the supreme court ruling that guarantees the right to abortion should fall. “That is not what we’re focused on at this time,” Tate Reeves said. The ruling, Roe v Wade, seems likely to be overturned this summer, after the leak of a draft supreme court decision supported by five conservatives on the nine-member court. The leak set off celebrations among conservatives and protests among liberals, as a near 50-year battle over a key privacy right approached a decisive moment. Like other states, Mississippi has a “trigger law” which if Roe falls will outlaw almost all abortions, with exceptions in cases of rape or threat to the life of the mother. The case at issue in the draft ruling, Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organisation, originated in Mississippi. Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Reeves confirmed that his state’s trigger law would go into effect if Roe is overturned. Reeves’ host on CNN, Jake Tapper, then referred to neighbouring Louisiana, where Republicans have advanced a bill to make abortion a crime of murder. Tapper said: “They’re talking about not only criminally charging girls and women who get abortions as committing homicide, but they’re also talking about defining the moment of conception as fertilisation, which would theoretically … mean if you use an IUD [intrauterine device], you are committing murder. “… I’m not making this up. These are the conversations going on in legislatures in your area. So, just to be clear, you have no intention of seeking to ban IUDs or Plan B [morning-after pills]?” Reeves said: “That is not what we’re focused on at this time. “We’re focused on looking at – see[ing] what the court allows for. The bill that is before the court is a 15-week [abortion] ban. We believe that the overturning of Roe is the correct decision by the court. And so, in Mississippi, we don’t have laws on the books that would lead to arresting individuals or anything along those lines.” Asked if that meant he would arrest doctors who performed abortions, Reeves said: “I don’t think that you’re going to see doctors performing abortions if we have a state statute which says that they’re not allowable, except for those exceptions that we have mentioned earlier.” Reeves also said: “I believe that life begins at conception. “And as I have said repeatedly – and I know where this question is ultimately going with respect to birth control and other measures – I want to be clear. My view is that the next phase of the pro-life movement is focusing on helping those moms that maybe have an unexpected and unwanted pregnancy. “The next phase of the pro-life movement is making sure that those babies, once born, have a productive life. And while I’m sure there will be conversations around America regarding [contraception], it’s not something that we have spent a lot of time focused on.” Democratic New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand told CNN she was “pretty offended by [Reeves’] remarks. “He doesn’t look at women as full citizens,” Gillibrand said. “He’s taken away their right to make these fundamental decisions about when they’re having children, under what circumstances they’re having children, how many children they’re having, at what point in their life they’re having children. “It’s outrageous that this governor and governors and legislatures across America are going to take this draft opinion, when it is final, and deny women these fundamental life-and-death decisions about their future and about their families.”",News/US news,Mississippi governor refuses to rule out banning contraception,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/mississippi-governor-contraception-abortion-rights
5/10/2022,"An experimental cancer therapy that infuses designer immune cells into patients has shown early promise in a clinical trial by shrinking tumours in the digestive system. Interim results from the first phase of the clinical trial found that the tumours in nearly half – 48.6% – of the 37 patients treated so far reduced in size after the therapy. While the findings come from an initial safety assessment of the approach, researchers running the trial in Beijing believe it demonstrates the potential for genetically altered immune cells to treat advanced gastrointestinal cancers. So-called Car T-cell therapy takes white blood cells, or T cells, from patients and modifies them so that they can recognise and kill cancer cells. The approach has met with dramatic success as a treatment for blood cancers such as leukaemia, but solid tumours have proved more difficult to target. Writing in Nature Medicine, researchers led by Dr Lin Shen at the Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute describe how they made Car T cells that target tumours bearing a protein called CLDN18.2. The protein is found in many cancers, but particularly in gastrointestinal tumours. The researchers infused Car T cells into 37 patients with advanced cancers of the stomach, digestive tract or pancreas and found that while all experienced side-effects, the therapy had an “acceptable safety profile”. The treatment seemed most effective in those with stomach cancer, with more than 57% responding to the infusions. The scientists stress that the findings need to be verified in the complete trial, but say the interim results suggest the approach “has the potential to become an important treatment modality for patients with advanced gastric cancer”. About 6,500 people are diagnosed with stomach cancer in the UK each year, roughly half of whom are over 75. Waseem Qasim, professor of cell and gene therapy at the Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street hospital, who works on Car T-cell therapies, said the preliminary results were promising. “The report provides some strong hints that engineered Car T cells can help shrink gastric cancers, in this case by targeting a particular flag on the surface of cells. As for other advanced solid cancers, achieving complete remissions is challenging, but the experiences shows there is potential for interventions that redirect the immune system against cancer,” he said. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, said: “Car T-cell therapies, which harness modified versions of our own immune cells to fight cancer, have so far had limited success in solid tumours, which make up most cancers. So it’s particularly promising to see these results, which show a high percentage of people with digestive cancers seeing the benefits of treatment last beyond six months. “This is encouraging, as people with digestive cancers have very few treatment options. The study is still at an early stage, and larger-scale clinical trials will need to be done before Car T-cell therapies can be used routinely in this setting.”",News/Science,Car T-cell therapy shows early promise in treating gastric cancers,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/09/car-t-cell-therapy-shows-early-promise-in-treating-gastric-cancers
5/10/2022,"It has been just over a year since Keir Starmer took part in the campaign event in Durham that now holds the key to his political future. This is what has happened: As part of campaigning for the Hartlepool byelection and local elections, both on 6 May, Starmer and aides were in Durham to campaign. Late that evening, a University of Durham student shot grainy phone footage of Starmer, inside the constituency office of local Labour MP Mary Foy, drinking a bottle of beer while people behind him hold plates of food. The video was shared on social media, but created little attention. The Sun ran a brief story about the footage, with a quote from the Conservatives saying people should be “asking questions” about what Starmer did. Labour insisted all rules were followed. With the idea of politicians potentially breaching lockdown rules in the news due to events in Downing Street, the Daily Mail ran a still image from the video on its front page calling Starmer “the Covid party hypocrite”. Durham constabulary said it had reviewed the video footage and would take no action, as the force did “not believe an offence has been established in relation to the legislation and guidance in place at that time”. With Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak having been given fixed-penalty notices for lockdown-beaching socialising earlier in the month, the Daily Mail returned to Starmer’s case, saying Durham constabulary had said they would consider a request from the North West Durham Conservative MP Richard Holden to look again at the case The Daily Mail and several other right-leaning papers printed a series of other stories about the Durham event, including a claim that the takeaway curry order was larger than billed, and doubts that Starmer and colleagues worked after the meal. Durhamconstabulary said they had reopened the investigation after receiving “significant new information” about the gathering. It is not clear what the information might be. After days of speculation about what Starmer might do if he was fined, given he called for Johnson and Sunak to resign after their fixed-penalty notices, Starmer made a public statement saying that while he was “absolutely clear” all rules had been followed, if police did fine him he would “of course do the right thing and step down”.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer and Beergate: what happened and when?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/keir-starmer-and-beergate-what-happened-and-when
5/10/2022,"In early February 1814, an elephant walked across the surface of the Thames near Blackfriars Bridge in London. The stunt was performed during the frost fair, when temperatures were so cold that for four days the top layers of the river froze solid. Londoners promptly held a festival, complete with what we might now call pop-up shops and a lot of unlicensed alcohol. Nobody could have known it at the time, but this was the last of the Thames frost fairs. They had taken place every few decades, at wildly irregular intervals, for several centuries. One of the most celebrated fairs took place during the Great Frost of 1683-84 and saw the birth of Chipperfield’s Circus. But the river in central London has not frozen over since 1814. The frost fairs are perhaps the most emblematic consequences of the “little ice age”, a period of chilly weather that lasted for several centuries. But while Londoners partied on the ice, other communities faced crop failures and other threats. The story of the little ice age is one of societies forced to adapt to changing conditions or perish. It’s also a long-standing mystery. Why did the climate cool and why did it stay that way for centuries? Thanks to decades of studies, we are finally closing in on an explanation. The emerging story involves volcanoes, the oceans, possibly the sun and possibly also genocide. Like most things in science, the little ice age was discovered slowly and piecemeal. “This all came about because there were lots of documentary records from around Europe, stating that there were some really cold winters,” says climatologist Paola Moffa-Sánchez of Durham University. These were reflected in records of grain prices, which rose because of crop failures and ships’ logs saying Greenland was surrounded by sea ice and unreachable. The term “little ice age” was coined by a Dutch-born geologist named François Matthes, who in a 1939 report noted that glaciers in the Sierra Nevada in California had regrown at some point within the last few millennia. The term stuck, but it took decades to narrow down the timeframe. This was done by British climatologist Hubert Lamb, who went on to found the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. In a study published in 1965, Lamb used European temperature records going back many centuries to identify a “notably warm climate… around AD1000–1200” that was “followed by a decline of temperature levels till between 1500 and 1700 the coldest phase since the last ice age occurred”. This chilly period was “undoubtedly upsetting for the human economies of those times (and perhaps of any time)” [his italics]. Since then, climatologists have tried to specify the duration and extent of the little ice age, but this has proved difficult. Most of the records showing the cooling are from Europe and records from elsewhere do not always show it. “It’s not a global phenomenon, in that it wasn’t cool everywhere,” says Alexander Koch at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. In some places, such as China, the period was marked by a wetter but not cooler climate. What’s more, “the cooling was not continuous”, says Dagomar Degroot of Georgetown University in Washington DC. “It came in waves… that reached different places at different times at different magnitudes.” For this reason, the start and end of the little ice age are a little vague. “The classical definition is between 1400 and 1850,” says Moffa-Sánchez. However, “some people say 1300 to 1850”, pushing the start date back significantly. There is broad agreement that the period 1400-1800 is within the little ice age, she says, but outside that it’s fuzzy. Either way, the 1814 frost fair was near the end of the period. Furthermore, the little ice age was not technically an ice age. These are periods in which Earth has permanent ice at both poles and we have been in one for more than 2.5m years. Within that period, the ice sheets have repeatedly waxed and waned. The most recent ice advance, which we colloquially call the ice age but is really a glacial period, occurred from about 115,000 to  11,700 years ago. Since then, we have been in a relatively warm period called the Holocene. In that context, the little ice age is minor. “We’re talking about several 10ths of a degree C,” says Degroot. In contrast, the coldest portion of the last glacial period is thought to have been about 6C cooler than the past 4,000 years. Still, Degroot says, even this small change mattered. “On a regional or local scale, the anomalies could be really quite extreme,” he says, and documentary evidence shows that “at least some people were aware that they were living in an anomalous kind of climate”. What was going on? The story isn’t entirely settled, but researchers are increasingly confident about the initial trigger: volcanoes. “You have these eruptions that are happening in clusters,” says Degroot. A 2015 study used data from ice cores to identify 25 major eruptions from the past 2,500 years. Between 1200 and 1400, there were huge eruptions of the Samalas volcano in Indonesia, Quilotoa in Ecuador and El Chichón in Mexico. Big eruptions blast sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere, the layer of the atmosphere above the weather. These aerosols reflect some of the sun’s rays back into space, cooling the Earth. In recent times, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippines triggered up to 0.5C of surface cooling. Usually, an eruption only cools the climate for a few years. “But if you have big eruptions in clusters, that can set off positive feedbacks in the climate system,” says Degroot. For example, several years of cooler temperatures cause sea ice to expand. Sea ice is white, so compared with dark blue water it reflects more radiation back into space. “That can prolong and exacerbate the cooling,” he adds. There can also be knock-on effects in the ocean, says Moffa-Sánchez. If the winds change, huge rafts of sea ice can be carried south from Greenland into the Labrador Sea. There, they interfere with the huge Atlantic currents that carry warm water from the tropics towards Europe. This is a complex story, in which the slight initial cooling from the volcanoes triggers changes in the Earth system that lead to more and lasting cooling. But it seems to hold true. A 2018 modelling study found that it was not possible to explain the little ice age without invoking volcanic eruptions, although that did not mean other factors were not also at work. Another possible factor is the sun. The amount of energy it pumps out varies ever so slightly, most famously over the 11-year solar cycle during which activity varies from a maximum to a minimum and back again. The effects on Earth are so small they’re hard to detect, but the sun sometimes has more of an impact. Several times in the past 1,000 years, our star has entered a “grand minimum”, in which it spends several decades being less active. The most recent was the Dalton Minimum between 1790 and 1820. This was preceded by the Maunder Minimum of 1645-1715. Before that, there is thought to have been the Spörer Minimum between about 1460 and 1550 and the Wolf Minimum around 1280-1350. Such grand minima can cool the planet, though by no more than 0.3C and probably less. Grand minima probably played a role in some of the chilliest episodes, says Moffa-Sánchez. In her studies of the period, “cold centuries coincided with these really famous solar minima.” She has found evidence that grand minima affect wind patterns, with knock-on effects for ocean currents and heat distribution. However, it seems unlikely that grand minima alone caused the little ice age. The timings don’t fit and, in any case, the climate impacts of grand minima are much smaller than those of massive eruptions. It may be that a solar maximum in the late 1300s also played a role. A study published in December 2021 found that this shifted wind patterns, interfering with the crucial Atlantic warm water current. The key point is – this isn’t an either-or debate, says Moffa-Sánchez. “It’s a likely combination of all of them.” Numerous causes helps explain why the climate shifts came in waves, rather than there being one abrupt change to a lasting cooler state. “It was not that you had this little ice age period where it was always cold,” says Moffa-Sánchez. “You just had several cold centuries throughout this four-century-long period.” However, one big puzzle remains. The coldest period of the little ice age was around 1610 and it doesn’t coincide with a grand minimum. Nor was there a particularly big eruption: Peru’s Huaynaputina went off in 1600, but while the blast was large it wasn’t exceptional. Instead, the suggestion is that this cold spell was caused by humanity – in a truly horrible way. In 1492, Christopher Columbus reached the Americas. Over the following decades, Europeans began colonising them. In the process, they fought with Indigenous Americans, often killing them. But even more lethally, they brought diseases. One of the worst was smallpox, which killed millions. As well as being a genocide and a tragedy, this may have had an impact on the climate. Many Indigenous Americans were farmers who had cleared forests for their crops and when they died the trees grew back, drawing carbon dioxide out of the air and cooling the planet. This scenario was first outlined by climatologist William Ruddiman in 2003, as part of his “early Anthropocene” hypothesis that humans have been affecting Earth’s climate for millennia, albeit less than we are today. The idea that mass deaths among Indigenous Americans led to climate cooling has received tentative support from modelling studies. Still, it has been controversial because there are so many uncertainties about the key numbers. However, in 2019 Koch and his colleagues published an updated analysis. They went through the argument step by step and tried to quantify everything, from the number of people who died to the extent of reforestation. They concluded that the European arrival led to 56m deaths by 1600. This dreadful toll meant trees grew again on 56m hectares of land, removing 27.4bn bn kilograms of carbon dioxide from the air. “It’s a really interesting theory,” says Degroot. However, he remains sceptical because we don’t know how land use was changing in other parts of the world, especially Africa. While the question of whether human society contributed to the little ice agee remains up for discussion, what’s clear is that the little ice age affected human society. For example, Norse settlers made their home in Greenland in 985 and stayed for centuries, only abandoning it in the early 1400s. It has often been suggested that the little ice age played a role in that. However, a study published in March looked at sediments from the region and found no sign of cooling, but it did find a drying trend, which would have meant less grass to feed livestock. Such stories may be true, but it’s crucial to remember that people were not passive victims, says Degroot. “You don’t just see people who are completely at the whim of changing climatic conditions, you see people changing adaptively.” Degroot points to the Arctic, where there was often remarkable activity despite the increase in sea ice. Between 1611 and 1619, European whalers operated off the shores of Svalbard, because there was a shortage of vegetable oil and whale oil was a substitute. For the Dutch Republic, the period between 1560 and 1720 was something of a golden age, despite or even because of the cold winters. It did not depend on home-grown agriculture, so local crop failures were less of a problem, says Degroot. Instead, the republic’s economy was driven by merchant ships, whose operators devised ingenious ways to cope with the cold – and the Dutch thrived while their neighbours struggled. “It so rarely is what you’d expect,” says Degroot. Studying how past societies responded to climatic shifts such as the little ice age will help us all, as the climate crisis becomes ever more intense. “Hopefully, we can learn from them, figure out what they did right, what they did wrong.” We had better learn fast, because the little ice age was just a taster. Back then, the average global temperature cooled by a fraction of a degree, but we’ve already warmed it by 1.1C, and are set to blow past 1.5C in the next few decades.",News/Environment,Climate crisis: what lessons can we learn from the last great cooling-off period?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/09/climate-crisis-lessons-to-learn-from-the-little-ice-age-cooling
