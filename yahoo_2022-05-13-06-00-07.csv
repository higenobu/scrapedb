5/13/2022,"The national average gas price for regular unleaded at nearly $4.42 per gallon today — well over $1 more than this time last year, according to gasprices.aaa.com. This week alone, since Monday, May 9, 2022, the price rose by 9 cents. This is in spite of decreased demand which would, typically, lower prices at the pump.

Live Blog: Elon Musk, Inflation, Crypto Crash, SNAP/Food Stamps, Social Security and More In spite of the market volatility and climbing prices, President Joe Biden announced on Thursday, May 12, that his administration is canceling the Alaskan Oil & Gas Lease, according to a report from CBSNews.com. The lease would have given companies the opportunity to drill for oil in Cook Inlet, Alaska, an area spanning 1 million acres. In a statement to CBS News, the Department of the Interior said that there was a “lack of industry interest in leasing in the area.” To auction off-shore leases, the Department of Interior must follow a five-year plan, CBS News reported. The current plan was set to expire at the end of May, and there had been no interest in leasing the land. Since the land was not currently being leased, the decision does not reduce the amount of crude oil available; it only reduces the potential to mine for oil in the region. However, Frank Macchairola of the American Petroleum Institute called the decision “another example of the administration’s lack of commitment to oil and gas development in the U.S.” He told CBS News, “In the kind of price environment that we’re seeing, there are negative consequences to shutting off oil and gas development, both politically and practically.” However, the decision does support Biden’s commitment to environmental sustainability, as outlined in his Federal Sustainability Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. to 50% of 2005 levels by 2030. Leasing the Cook Inlet could have led to the creation of new underwater pipelines and offshore drilling across 1 million acres for more than 40 years. While access to this source of oil may have helped mitigate rising gas prices, it would not have provided immediate relief. Plus, it cuts off one potential avenue to reducing the U.S. dependency on foreign oil. On the heels of the announcement, the Department of the Interior pointed out that, of the 10.9 million acres of offshore federal waters already under lease, only 25% are being used to produce oil, the New York Post reported. Republicans in Congress openly tweeted their disagreement with the Biden administration’s decision. “Gas prices are at a record high, and Biden just canceled oil and gas leases in Alaska and the Gulf,” tweeted Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). The decision may drive gas prices even higher, but a number of other factors — including increased demand sparked by the upcoming Memorial Day holiday weekend — may also play a role.

For now, the best course of action for U.S. drivers is to use an app to shop around for lower prices, be mindful that gas stations in specific locations may cost more, pay cash to take advantage of lower pricing, and top off when you see prices drop so you are never stuck with a tank close to “E” when gas prices are trending upward.

5/13/2022,"Celebrities began hawking crypto in earnest last fall as bitcoin was hitting record highs. But if you invested then, you'd be seeing losses over 50% right now. Cryptocurrencies plummeted for the second day Thursday after the collapse of a major stablecoin. If you've turned on your TV anytime in the past six months or so, chances are you've seen a celebrity hawking crypto. And if you're among those swayed by their endorsements, you'd be out hundreds, if not thousands of dollars right now. Celebrities have been steadily hopping on the crypto craze for years, but it wasn't until last fall that they began starring in high-profile ad campaigns promoting cryptocurrency exchange platforms. In September, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen appeared in a $20 million campaign for crypto exchange FTX where they called people in their contacts — everyone from a surgeon to a dog-walker — to convince them to start investing on the platform. Then, famously, Matt Damon joined the party with a much-maligned ad for Crypto.com where he compared investing in cryptocurrencies to being brave enough to travel to outer space. By the time the Super Bowl rolled around, crypto ads dominated the commercial breaks. Larry David and LeBron James were starring in ads of their own — David's FTX ad was based on the premise that if you didn't start investing in crypto, you'd be dismissing something as genius as the invention of the wheel. So, how much money would you have lost if you listened to the likes of Brady or Damon? Well, if you invested in bitcoin on October 28 when Damon's ad debuted, over 52% of your investment would have been wiped out by now. Which means, as The Intercept's Jon Schwarz pointed out on Twitter, that if you'd bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin at the time, you'd have about $526 right now. Those who invested following the Super Bowl, an event with 208 million viewers, are seeing less of a startling crash right now — about 30% — but a wipeout nonetheless. Thursday marked the second day of cryptocurrency turmoil, with bitcoin nosediving to its lowest since December 2020 and other major coins — like ether, solana, and cardano — sinking by as much as 30%. The sell-off comes after TerraUSD, a major stablecoin that's supposed to maintain the same value as the US dollar, plunged to less than $0.30, rattling investor confidence amid a time of broader turmoil in the stock market. Bitcoin, which hit a record high of $69,000 in November, fell below $26,000 Thursday morning, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, plummeted below $1,900, according to CoinMarketCap.

5/13/2022,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee is resigning her post as the state's top election official, Gov. Ron DeSantis' office said Thursday. In a resignation letter, Lee, a Republican, said she would step down Monday and thanked the governor, who appointed her in 2019. Her letter did not specify a reason for leaving but news outlets have reported that she is considering a run for Congress. ""I am grateful for your support throughout my tenure, and I am honored to have been part of your vision for our state,"" she wrote in her resignation letter to DeSantis. “I will continue to seek what's best for the citizens of Florida and will always be proud of what we accomplished together.” DeSantis' office said it would soon have an announcement on Lee's replacement. “Over the past 20 years, Florida has become one of the best states in the nation at administering elections, and Secretary Lee built on that tradition,” said DeSantis spokeswoman Taryn Fenske. “As Secretary of State, she helped ensure Florida had an efficient election in 2020, with accurate results.” Prior to becoming secretary of state, Lee was a judge in Hillsborough County, a former federal prosecutor and federal public defender. DeSantis appointed Lee in early 2019. Her predecessor, Michael Ertel, abruptly stepped down after a newspaper obtained photos of him in blackface at a party in 2005. Ertel later apologized.

5/13/2022,"Editor’s note: This article was first published on HistoryNet, our sister publication. Subscribe to its newsletter here. Though the Russian Army was once vaunted as the second-best military in the modern world, the greatly underestimated Ukrainian military has showed it up again and again, seemingly with only national pluck and a hodgepodge of donated weapons from sympathetic Western countries. Among the borrowed Ukrainian arsenal, the Panzerfaust 3 has made an impressive showing against Russian armored columns. What is this shoulder-fired antitank rocket, where did it come from, and why is it striking fear into Vladimir Putin’s soldiers? In 1943, with a resurgent Soviet army advancing on the Third Reich behind a phalanx of first-class tanks being produced in numbers that Germany has no hope of matching, Germany developed a small, simple, easy to use antitank weapon that could turn any wielder into a tank killer. Called the Panzerfaust (“armor fist”), it was essentially a tube that launched a rocket-propelled grenade with a shaped charge capable of penetrating armor at ranges up to 200 feet. The launching tube could be reloaded if extra warheads were available, but inexpensive enough to be discarded if they were not. Distributed among soldiers and, as of Oct. 18, 1944, to hastily trained elders and children of the Volkssturm (“people’s storm,” Nazi Germany’s last-ditch national militia), the Panzerfaust required extraordinary courage to operate at its effective range and was not reliable enough to save the Reich from its ultimate doom on May 8 (or May 9, depending on who you ask) the next year. It was, however, effective enough for postwar armies on either side of Iron Curtain to make improvements on its basic design. That includes the current German Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces) in the form of the Panzerfaust 3. After entering combat in Afghanistan with the Bundeswehr, the new generation of Panzerfausts is again battling Russian tanks … except that the people wielding the antitank weapons are Ukrainian. In response to a 1973 order for a more powerful, accurate semi-disposable weapon to replace the World War II-vintage PzF-44, capable of engaging the latest generation of Russian T-72 and T-80 tanks, the Dynomit Nobel Allgemeine Gesellschaft worked on this latest version of the antitank rocket from 1978 to 1995, though the Panzerfaust 3 was accepted by the Bundeswehr in 1992. It has since undergone technical upgrades to keep up with improvements in tanks, especially the Panzerfaust 3-T, which uses a dual hollow-charge tandem warhead, with a spike on the front of the warhead that can set off reactive armor and in so doing free a path for the main charge to reach and penetrate up to 31.5 inches of steel armor. As a further improvement, the Panzerfaust 3-IT600 gets its designation from the user’s ability to engage enemy armored vehicles at up to 600 meters by using a Simrad Optonics sighting-and-targeting mechanism. Once fired, the warhead is sent on its way by a spring, but after about 16.5 feet, the rocket motor ignites and the safety disengages, allowing the warhead to explode on contact with its target. The warhead also contains plastic granulate that work on the recoilless countermass principle to virtually eliminate backblast. The Panzerfaust 3-IT600 is 3 feet, 11 inches long and weighs 34 pounds, 6 ounces, of which 8 pounds, 10 ounces is the 110mm-diameter (4.3-inch diameter) warhead with Amatol/Sindal high explosive. Up to 29 pounds, 5 ounces of spare rounds can be carried by the operator. With a muzzle velocity of 499 feet per second, the warhead has a maximum effective range of 1,312 feet on a stationary target and 1,968.5 feet against a moving target. Minimum effective range (without the debris of an exploding target endangering the user) is 65.6 feet. These capabilities pale beside the 125mm (4.9-inch) main gun with a 1.86-mile range on Russia’s latest main battle tank, the T-90, in an open battlefield. As with the original PzF-44, however, Panzerfaust 3 operated on uneven ground, forested areas or urban environments by trained, motivated troops can be every bit as deadly as designed. Once under full production, the original Panzerfaust 3 cost $9,994, but the IT-600 version costs $11,108 apiece because of its computerized sight. A standard antitank round costs $297, but there is also a Bunkerfaust (“bunker fist”) round for use against static enemy positions. That costs $202. As of 2003, 261,718 Panzerfaust 3s have been produced. In 1989, Japan became the first foreign power to purchase the weapon, followed by Switzerland in 1991. Since then, it has also entered the arsenals of Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, South Korea Iraq and Mauritius. Ukraine added its name to that list when Russian forces invaded it in February 2022 and a variety of sympathetic Western powers began supplying weapons — including the Panzerfaust 3 — to bolster Ukraine’s defenses. Thus far, the Ukrainians have been putting them to very good use, much to the expense of a growing number of Russian armor crews.",World/Air Force Times,Panzerfaust 3: The Cold War weapon wrecking Russian tanks in Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/panzerfaust-3-cold-war-weapon-185704837.html
5/13/2022,"STORY: ""I'm going to find the defendant not guilty to the charge of indecent assault and battery."" Celebrity chef Mario Batali was acquitted on Tuesday of indecently assaulting a woman at a Boston bar in 2017, while posing with her for fan ""selfie” photos. Thirty-two year-old Natali Tene brought charges against Batali in 2019. In the non-jury trial, she testified that he groped her and forcibly kissed her, while drunkenly posing for selfies with her. But Boston Municipal Court Judge James Stanton concluded Tene had “significant credibility issues”, which supported the defence team’s claim that her motive was financial gain. However, he had some words of advice for the 61-year-old chef too. ""It's an understatement to say that Mr. Batali did not cover himself in glory on the night in question. His conduct and his appearance and his demeanour were not befitting of a public person of his stature at that time. It is a lesson for all of those people and public with celebrity positions.” If convicted, Batali could have faced up to 2.5 years in jail and registration as a sex offender. Several women had made similar claims against him to the media, which led to Batali being fired from talk show ""The Chew."" He later cut ties with restaurants including New York's Babbo and Del Posto that he partly owned. He's denied allegations of sexual assault but apologized for ""deeply inappropriate"" behaviour.",World/Reuters Videos,Star chef Mario Batali acquitted of indecent assault,https://news.yahoo.com/star-chef-mario-batali-acquitted-061115695.html
