12/27/2021,"West Ham’s challenge for a place in the top four is in danger of falling apart. After defying expectations for so long, David Moyes’s side can barely do anything right at the moment. They have become too easy to play against and their need for defensive reinforcements to arrive in January could scarcely have been more glaring during this shoddy defeat to Southampton, who ruthlessly exposed their’s weaknesses without Kurt Zouma and Angelo Ogbonna holding everything together at the back. Those injuries to Zouma and Ogbonna have taken a heavy toll. The harsh reality is that a central-defensive pairing of Issa Diop and Craig Dawson will not be enough for West Ham to qualify for the Champions League. The balance of the team has disappeared and although Moyes’s side twice dragged themselves level in the second half here, they could have no complaints when Jan Bednarek headed Southampton into the lead for the third and final time with 20 minutes left.  There was no way back once Bednarek had made it 3-2. Southampton, who had only won once on the road, held firm despite some late pressure and deservedly rose nine points above the bottom three. West Ham, who have won one of their last seven league games, were ragged and misshapen from start to finish. Travel chaos meant that the crowd was well below capacity and the mood in the stands was not helped by the inertia on the pitch. West Ham were slow to everything during the early stages and Southampton were quick to take advantage, hounding the hosts into errors before taking a deserved lead when Mohamed Elyounoussi fired a fine shot past Lukasz Fabianski from 20 yards. Nobody was surprised when Southampton went ahead after eight minutes of total dominance. Their control of midfield was key. Ralph Hasenhüttl’s decision to ditch his usual 4-2-2-2 system for a 4-3-3 left Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek chasing shadows in the middle and although Southampton’s opener was far too easy from Moyes’s perspective, there was much to admire about the way Elyounoussi moved through the middle before exchanging passes with Kyle Walker-Peters and drilling a low, hard effort into the bottom-left corner. West Ham retreated further into their shell after falling behind to Elyounoussi’s first league goal since August. There was no cutting edge, with Michail Antonio only ready for a place on the bench after returning from a period in self-isolation. Jarrod Bowen was struggling to assert himself against Southampton’s quick and strong centre-back, Mohammed Salisu, and there was little evidence of any understanding between West Ham’s creative players, with Nikola Vlasic, Saïd Benrahma and Pablo Fornals all ineffective in the final third. It was too predictable from West Ham, who were fortunate not to go two down when Elyounoussi shot straight at Fabianski. They looked reliant on set-pieces and barely threatened before the break, aside from the moment when an error from Bednarek allowed Vlasic to test Fraser Forster. Moyes had seen enough. Antonio and Manuel Lanzini came on for Fornals and Vlasic at half-time and the improvement in West Ham was instant. Lanzini began to link the play and the equaliser soon arrived. Bowen delivered a corner from the right, Dawson rose above James Ward-Prowse at the far post and the ummarked Antonio nodded past Forster from close range. Suddenly, with Bowen on the right and Antonio up front, West Ham looked more like themselves. They almost led when Rice, who will miss Tuesday’s game at Watford after picking up his fifth booking of the season, swept a shot inches wide from 25 yards. Southampton were undeterred though. They knew that West Ham have not been as solid at the back after losing Aaron Cresswell, Ogbonna and Zouma. The visitors had identified Arthur Masuaku as a weak link at left-back and they went in front again when Diop was turned by the impressive Armando Broja, a deceptively powerful runner who looked to have a strong case for a penalty after falling over Dawson’s clumsy challenge as he rumbled through on goal. For a brief moment it seemed that Dawson had got away with it, but Kevin Friend had no doubt after being sent to the pitchside monitor for a second look. Dawson was all over Broja, who was a nuisance throughout, and Ward-Prowse beat Fabianski from the spot to put Southampton back in front. Now it was a proper contest. West Ham equalised again when Soucek started a flowing counterattack in the 64th minute. Bowen burst down the right and his cross found Benrahma, who provided his one useful contribution of the afternoon by volleying past Forster. Unfortunately for Moyes, West Ham were still too open at the back. Southampton kept pushing and there was no way back for West Ham when Ward-Prowse’s free-kick from the left was glanced in by Bednarek.",Sport/Football,Jan Bednarek pushes Southampton past Moyes’ slumping West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/west-ham-southampton-premier-league-match-report
12/27/2021,"Crystal Palace did not want to play here, as they struggled to control a Covid outbreak that hit the manager, Patrick Vieira, and a number of players, and they wanted it to end from the moment Wilfried Zaha caught the collective mood of frustration and got himself sent off. There were 37 minutes on the clock, Tottenham were 2-0 up and Zaha let his team down when he grappled with Davinson Sánchez before hurling his opponent to the ground. The club’s marquee name was already on a booking and Palace were en route to extending a worrying run of results. It is now just one win in seven Premier League games.  It was Tottenham’s day and, more specifically, it was that of Lucas Moura. The winger menaced Palace with his speed and direct running and he would finish with assists for Harry Kane and Son Heung-min – either side of a goal he scored himself. On 82 minutes and the contest long since over, the home crowd sung the name of their manager, Antonio Conte, who responded with applause. The transformation that he has driven since replacing Nuno Espírito Santo in early November has been nothing short of remarkable: it is four wins, two draws and no defeats, the team well-placed for a Champions League push, with a Carabao Cup quarter-final victory to add into the mix. Reports had surfaced on Christmas Day that the game was in jeopardy, with Palace reporting positive Covid tests, and it was not until three and a half hours before kick-off that the clubs confirmed, via Twitter, it would go ahead. The Premier League’s board had met to consider Palace’s application for a postponement and they were not satisfied that it met the criteria. When the teamsheets dropped, Palace showed one change from their previous game – the 2-2 home draw against Southampton on 15 December – and the absentees took in Vicente Guaita, Nathaniel Clyne, James McArthur, Luka Milivojevic, Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and Christian Benteke. The stadium was dotted with empty seats and it had been a slow-burn start, with passes going astray and little incision or risk-taking. Both teams wanted to counter and it was noticeable how Spurs sat deep at the outset, inviting Palace onto them. Palace did not seem comfortable when asked to proactively prise their opponents apart. Lucas blew the game open. He had missed a glorious chance on 25 minutes, glancing past the far post from Sergio Reguilón’s cross, before he ignited the move for the opening goal. It was exactly what Conte had wanted: Palace’s defenders to be drawn out and his players to sprint in behind them. James Tomkins stepped up to engage Lucas, who popped the ball wide to Emerson Royal and continued his run. When he got it back, Palace were stretched, Lucas outpacing Joachim Andersen to cross low for Kane, who swept home. Lucas quickly twisted the knife. It was another impressive burst from him and, when he worked it right for Kane who played in Emerson, Lucas tore into the area to provide the option. Emerson stood up the cross and Lucas got there ahead of Andersen, dominating him in the air to nod the ball down and in. Zaha had been booked for a nibble on Sánchez just before the first goal and so he had to think that raising his hands to the same opponent would have been akin to playing with fire. Zaha did not think, his passions getting the better of him as he tussled with the Spurs centre-half by the touchline, and it was a roughhouse move he used to send him over. The stand-in Palace manager, Osian Roberts, stared into space from his seat on the bench. Palace’s only attempt of the first half had come inside the opening 60 seconds, Jordan Ayew taking a touch and shooting high, and Roberts was now forced deeper into damage-limitation mode. He began the second-half with Odsonne Édouard on the left of a midfield four, Ayew as the lone front-runner, and the only question came to concern whether Spurs would gild their margin of victory. Oliver Skipp, who had lashed wide in the 11th minute when well-placed on the edge of the area, had another strong game, snapping into challenges, and it was remarkable to see how often Emerson got into dangerous positions from right wing-back. Kane steered just over from a Son corner and Conte did not leave him on much beyond the hour, mindful of the meeting with Southampton on Tuesday. It was a tough watch for the travelling Palace fans, who cheered ironically when the referee, Jon Moss, booked Sánchez for a foul on Ayew. Conor Gallagher looked the part before Roberts withdrew him and Spurs got the goal that their second-half control merited when Lucas crossed from the right and Son touched home deftly at the near post.",Sport/Football,Lucas Moura carves apart Crystal Palace as Tottenham toast a festive triumph,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/tottenham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
12/27/2021,"A scaled-back Boxing Day trail-hunting programme will go ahead this year despite the worsening Covid situation and growing calls to ban the practice on public land, the Countryside Alliance has said. The majority of Boxing Day hunts are due to go ahead on 27 December because this year’s holiday falls on a Sunday, traditionally a day of rest for the hunting community.  Restrictions designed to slow the spread of the virus in Scotland and Wales have forced many packs to cancel public gatherings connected to their meets. Meanwhile, critics are demanding the prohibition on public land of a sport they believe is often merely a front for illegal foxhunting. The Labour party has denounced allowing hunts on public and government-owned land as “completely irresponsible”, prompting fierce criticism from the Countryside Alliance (CA), which accused the party of pursuing “anti-rural” policies. “Trail hunting and popular festive meets are an important part of rural life. Labour have consistently performed poorly in the countryside in recent elections and it is no surprise when they pursue anti-rural policies like those announced today,” a CA spokesperson said. “It is high time they drop their bizarre obsession with class warfare and focus on addressing issues which actually matter to rural people if they ever want to be taken seriously.” A Labour spokesperson pointed to a recent Farmers Weekly survey that suggested the party’s popularity among farmers had increased slightly since the last general election. “Other rural bodies recognise trail hunting for what it is – an antiquated exercise that most people believe should be consigned to the history books for animal welfare, protection of natural habitats and, unlike this Conservative government, respect for the rules.” The party said it planned to help rural communities if it formed the next government by focusing on creating jobs, tackling crime and improving public services such as bus routes and hospitals. The Countryside Alliance claims trail hunting, which involves following a scent set by a trail layer rather than a live animal, remains popular with spectators. But pressure to end the practice is growing. In November, National Trust members voted overwhelmingly to ban it on National Trust land. One of the biggest landowners in Wales, Natural Resources Wales, has also prohibited it. Activists believe more than 240 hunting days are likely to have taken place on Ministry of Defence land this year. Trail hunting’s proponents say it is a humane and legal way to carry on a centuries-old practice. Critics point to the case of a prominent huntsman who was fined in October after being found to have encouraged people to hide illegal foxhunting behind a “smokescreen” of trail hunting. The Countryside Alliance said: “Anti-hunt fanatics have spent years making ridiculous claims about hunting – which they often use to raise money – yet nearly every time it makes allegations to the police or a court, they are found to be false. “There have been hundreds of thousands of days legal trail hunting carried out by hunts since the Hunting Act came into force and only a handful of convictions relating to registered hunts. The reality is these prejudiced activists are driven by a hatred of people and not by improving animal welfare.” Chris Luffingham, the League Against Cruels Sports’ director of external affairs, said: “The Countryside Alliance is either breathtaking in its arrogance or suffering from amnesia. Just two short months ago, one of hunting’s most senior people was found guilty of telling more than 100 huntsmen and women on each of two training webinars how to use trail hunting as a ‘smokescreen’, to use his words, for what the judge then described as ‘old-fashioned illegal hunting’. “Mark Hankinson, the now former director of the Masters of Foxhounds Association, was supported in court by the Countryside Alliance. We suggest it is the Countryside Alliance’s leadership who are the fanatics, as they desperately try to defend a so-called sport that is as outdated and old-fashioned as it is cruel.”",News/UK news,Boxing Day hunts to go ahead despite Covid and calls for ban,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/26/boxing-day-hunts-to-go-ahead-despite-covid-and-calls-for-ban
12/27/2021,"Manchester City were ruthless, fell asleep, and then awoke to end finally a Leicester resistance that came in a sparkling second-half riposte to the champions, who were 4-0 up at the break. Yet the story might have ended differently if Brendan Rodgers’ men had been as ruthless as City. When James Maddison slipped in Kelechi Iheanacho on 70 minutes, the Nigerian was stopped by a defiant Ederson from moving the visitors to only 5-4 behind and Marc Albrighton later spurned a headed chance to do the same. If either opening had been taken, who knows what the closing phase might have thrown up.  Pep Guardiola, then, is bound to hate a slipshod passage from City while surely marvelling at the opening 45 minutes. The bottom line is the champions have 17 goals in their past three games and remain leaders after completing half their 38 Premier League matches, having won their last nine. Guardiola left Phil Foden and Jack Grealish on the bench again, as he plotted to continue a winning run against opponents who had Jamie Vardy among their substitutes. Whatever the thinking from Rodgers, this seemed to make the Foxes’s challenge even tougher as the No 9’s pace could have snared City on the counter, any quick ball likely to expose the hardly jet-heeled Rúben Dias and Aymeric Laporte. The problem, as Guardiola explained in the buildup, is City’s ascendancy is predicated on their hogging of possession. Any defensive weaknesses are nullified if the opposition cannot get hold of the ball. A latest imperious illustration came only five minutes in. Fernandinho’s chip found Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva’s run along the blindside dragged out defenders and the Belgian’s sweet pirouette inside preceded a cannon of a strike that allowed Kasper Schmeichel zero chance. The visitors had been overrun virtually from the opening whistle. Further disaster arrived when Riyad Mahrez swung in a corner and Youri Tielemans grappled with Dias. VAR called Chris Kavanagh to the pitchside monitor and, as usual when this occurs, he pointed to the spot. Mahrez blast his kick beyond Schmeichel. Inside a quarter of an hour there was a strong temptation to deem this contest over but the response was instant, as Maddison saw Ederson tip a 20-yard free-kick on to the bar. The goalkeeper then palmed away the corner and saved a low Ayoze Pérez shot. This, though, was the falsest of dawns. Silva, City’s performer of the season, collected and fed De Bruyne. The Belgian is the master of the quick tap-on and he fed João Cancelo this way, the right-back crossed, a flailing Schmeichel pushed the ball into Ilkay Gündogan’s path and he did not miss. Leicester’s shock became deep embarrassment when City scored a fourth. Raheem Sterling ran at Tielemans inside the area, the hapless No 8 fouled him and this was the home side’s second spot-kick. This time, despite Guardiola billing Mahrez as City’s best penalty executioner, it was Sterling who beat Schmeichel. City had scored 15 goals without reply in their previous two games plus the first 25 minutes of this one. For the resurgent Sterling it was a seventh in his last nine club appearances. Soon there was nearly a sublime eighth. Oleksandr Zinchenko’s left-footed dink was an exhibition-like pass, the ball floating in on a bewitching parabola to Silva, whose volleyed delivery across goal was as good and there was the England man to take aim first-time, but Schmeichel parried. Leicester did manage a rare foray that set up Luke Thomas from the D but the left-back blazed over. City closed the half how they began: at Leicester’s jugular, De Bruyne’s free-kick wrong-footing Leicester, setting up a Gündogan rocket that Schmeichel beat away. Rodgers may have missed a whole first-choice rearguard because of injury but the supposed master-tactician was still culpable for a passive performance from his side. But this changed in the 55th minute as a quick break did now unlock City. It began at the back – Albrighton pinged the ball to Maddison before, really, Dias should have cleaned the playmaker out. He did not, possession was moved to Iheanacho, who returned it and Maddison slid in Leicester’s first, under Ederson’s body. Seconds later, a near-replica. Maddison pickpocketed Gündogan, left Zinchenko and Fernandinho challenging air, and rolled the ball to Iheanacho, whose assist this time was for Ademola Lookman. At 4-2 the contest had fresh life. City had done what Guardiola detests: they had surrendered the ball. Fernadinho’s riposte was to head what appeared a fifth until Daniel Amartey intervened and in the next twist in a topsy-turvy affair Iheanacho scored, the striker following up when Maddison’s shot was steered on to his bar by Ederson. But Laporte rose above Iheanacho and Thomas to meet Mahrez’s corner perfectly and stretch City’s lead again and, after the Iheanacho and Albrighton misses, Sterling made it 6-3.",Sport/Football,Manchester City’s Laporte and Sterling end Leicester comeback in 6-3 thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/manchester-city-leicester-premier-league-match-report
12/27/2021,"Steve Borthwick’s Leicester held on to their unbeaten record as Guy Porter’s dramatic try deep in injury time dug them out of a hole. Porter went over thanks to a pass from the hooker Nic Dolly who had been fed by Freddie Steward to give Tigers their 10th league win out of 10. Ellis Genge was celebrating furiously on the touchlines as Porter went over in the fourth minute of injury after Leicester looked like they had thrown it away. A reckless challenge by Leicester replacement back-rower Jasper Wiese on the Bristol fly-half Callum Sheedy gave the Wales international what looked like the winning shot at goal.  Porter would never have scored his first Premiership try if the Bristol full-back Charles Piutau had not tried to keep the ball in play from George Ford’s late kick to touch at 26-23. He was judged to have knocked on and from the scrum, Leicester did the damage. Harry Randall was outstanding in his hour on the pitch, making two tries with his quick thinking and showing why Eddie Jones capped the scrum-half in the summer. And the Fijian centre Semi Radradra was at his magical best helping to create Bristol’s second try, for the wing Ioan Lloyd, with a pass out of the back of his hand. Genge is moving from Leicester to Bristol, where he made his professional debut in 2013 before leaving for Welford Road in 2016, the year he graduated to the England squad. “Gengey’s coming home,” rang out from the stands at Ashton Gate as the game went into the final quarter with Bears up 23-20. But the game-winning kick came shortly after Genge had been replaced, having enjoyed a good afternoon against Kyle Sinckler. The Genge transfer was given extra spice when Bristol released a welcome video of the prop coming arriving at their training ground and being greeted warmly by the Bears director of rugby, Pat Lam. The Welford Road following were not impressed but his current boss Borthwick has since said Genge’s move west has nothing to do with rugby. It might not, with Tigers riding high at the top of the Premiership. Bristol fans will have to wait until next season to see Genge in action for their side but they finally got the chance to see Radradra starting for the first time this season. They have the last two weekends off after European cancellations of games involving Scarlets and Stade Français and a couple of weeks rest allowed them to give Sinckler some R&R after the autumn internationals. Genge and Sinckler provided one of the match-ups of the day and it was the Leicester man who got the early advantage as Bristol conceded a free-kick and then a penalty from scrums. The second offence gave Ford the chance to open the scoring from 35 metres but the contest between the two props simmered all afternoon. Radradra had a try chalked off after he had knocked the ball on challenging Ben Youngs for a high ball but Bristol’s defensive resolve paid dividends at the right end of the pitch on 22 minutes. Randall picked up a loose ball after Ford’s pass hit the floor and scooted off on a diagonal run. That ended when he fed Lloyd who kept the move going before No 8 Fitz Harding crashed over through wing Nemani Nadolo. Sheedy kept the visitors at arm’s length with two penalties before Nadolo shortened the gap with a chip and chase in the Bristol 22 to leave it 13-10 at the break. Ford and Sheedy then swapped penalties before Bears finally got a bit of purchase at a scrum and won a free-kick. Randall took it quickly, darted right and fed Radradra who skipped outside before finding Lloyd with a pass out of the back door. But Leicester then pinned Bristol into their own 22 and a driving maul, from a lineout 15 metres out, splintered the home defence and hooker Julián Montoya came up smiling. Ford levelled it up at 23-23 before Sheedy thought he had won it. Then came Porter.",Sport/Sport,Guy Porter’s injury-time magic gives Leicester dramatic victory at Bristol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/26/bristol-leicester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
12/27/2021,"Bukayo Saka scored twice as Arsenal coasted to a 5-0 Boxing Day victory at Norwich to strengthen their hopes of a top-four Premier League finish. The Gunners have been able to fulfil all of their fixtures of late while others in the table have seen games postponed due to Covid-19 cases and Mikel Arteta’s side made light work of rock-bottom Norwich at Carrow Road.  Saka scored in both halves, his double coming either side of a rare Kieran Tierney strike with Alexandre Lacazette winning and converting a late penalty and Emile Smith Rowe striking off the bench as Arsenal outclassed the Canaries, who rarely threatened. The result means Arsenal can toast back-to-back away league wins for the first time this season and sit six points clear inside the Champions League places. Arsenal were missing Calum Chambers, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Cédric Soares and Takehiro Tomiyasu due to the coronavirus but they were not missed. The tone was set by Saka early on, the 20-year-old collecting a pass from the impressive Martin Ødegaard before slotting past Angus Gunn. The goalkeeper took the place of Norwich’s regular first-choice Tim Krul, who is among several positive Covid cases in Dean Smith’s squad. This was Gunn’s first Premier League start for Norwich and his first since conceding nine in goal for Southampton in their October 2019 defeat to Leicester and he would be picking the ball out of his net a few more times here. The home side battled for periods of the first half but – just as they seemed to have Arsenal rattled as Granit Xhaka and Ben White reacted to challenges – the game slipped away. Another fine ball from Ødegaard allowed Tierney to break into the box and fire in low across Gunn for his fourth goal for the club as half-time approached. There never looked like being an inspired second-half comeback for Norwich, who remain bottom on 10 points. Saka’s second goal in the 67th minute was a fine finish as the England winger cut inside Brandon Williams before striking from the edge of the box to wrap up the win. Arteta, whose side face a gruelling turnaround before they host Wolves in an early kick-off on Tuesday, moved to his bench to freshen things up but it did not stop a late flurry from the visitors. Lacazette was bundled over in the box by Ozan Kabak six minutes from time and picked himself up to tuck away the resulting penalty before Smith Rowe scored off the bench for the second league outing in succession. The win leaves Arsenal looking up but Norwich, who mustered just two shots on target, were jeered off at full time following another loss.",Sport/Football,Bukayo Saka’s double leads Arsenal’s 5-0 Boxing Day breeze past Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/norwich-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
12/27/2021,"British consumers have largely stayed away from the traditional Boxing Day sales amid concern over the Omicron Covid variant, with visits to high streets, shopping centres and retail parks down more than 45% on pre-pandemic levels, according to industry figures. Fears over the virus, as well as several key retailers including John Lewis, Marks & Spencer and Next deciding to keep their stores closed, and the traditional bumper shopping day falling on a Sunday this year, all put a dampener on sales.  By lunchtime on Sunday, numbers were only up just over a quarter on last year, when UK high streets were in lockdown, according to the latest data from shopping tracking group Springboard. “A major reason for the significantly lower footfall compared with 2019 will be due to consumers’ ongoing nervousness about the Covid infection rate,” said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, who said the figures indicated Boxing Day was unlikely to have given retailers the hoped for post-Christmas boost. “This will have been compounded by the fact that a few multiple retailers opted not to open today, which will have deterred some shoppers. In addition, Sunday generally has the lowest footfall on any day in the week, so a comparison with 2019 when Boxing Day fell on a Thursday will always have meant that footfall would be lower than two years ago.” Despite busier scenes on some high streets across the UK, including lengthy queues outside shops in central Manchester, Liverpool, and outside Selfridges on Oxford Street in London, experts said high street footfall was down on pre-pandemic levels. Covid restrictions as well as concern over Omicron put off consumers from going to physical shops, according to a poll of 2,000 shoppers on behalf of Barclaycard. The credit card operator said that as many as 40% would instead go online to avoid any queues and crowded areas. Wehrle said the mild weather and lack of a lockdown had not enticed shoppers to head out as much as businesses might have hoped. Central London was the hardest hit destination, with visitor numbers down 67% on pre-Covid levels in 2019 despite a major bounceback from last year when stores were forced to close – with numbers more than doubling. Regional cities excluding London also had a tough time, with numbers down nearly 60% on 2019 and just over 6% on last year. Market towns and outer London fared best as shoppers chose to stay close to home. The latest indicator of difficulties for retailers comes after shoppers were predicted to spend £3.9bn in stores and online on Boxing Day, as much as 10% less than before the pandemic and 1% lower than last year, according to analysis by GlobalData for the shopping deals website Vouchercodes. Spending in physical stores alone is expected to fall by 23% compared with 2019 as many shoppers avoid high streets, shopping centres and retail parks amid fears over the Omicron variant. Changing shopping habits were not expected to spell all good news for online specialists either. Over £1.4bn is expected to be spent online on Boxing Day, almost 18% less than last year, but just over a quarter up on 2019, before the pandemic, according to GlobalData. Despite the gloomy predictions, at least one shopping centre said it had been busy for the start of the post-Christmas sales. “Going shopping on Boxing Day is a yearly tradition for many with people looking to pick up some great deals from one of our many brands and enjoy a day out of the house,” a spokesperson for the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester said. “Although Boxing Day this year falls on a Sunday we’ve had a steady stream of visitors to Trafford Centre regardless of the shorter trading hours. We expect to see plenty of interest in the sales period throughout the week ahead, with Monday 27 December being a priority for retailer promotions.” Meanwhile Barclaycard predicted spending was likely to be up on last year and even 2019. Its survey found consumers planned to spend an average of £247 in the post-Christmas sales this year, up £85 compared with 2020 and up £61 compared with 2019.",News/Business,Britons shy away from Boxing Day sales amid concern over Omicron variant,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/26/britons-shy-away-from-boxing-day-sales-amid-concern-over-omicron-variant
12/27/2021,"Raymond Illingworth, who has died aged 89, was one of England’s most successful cricket captains, leading his side to a series victory in Australia, in 1970-71, and then retaining the Ashes at home, in 1972. A tough Yorkshireman and an all-rounder who gave nothing away with either bat or ball, as a skipper Illingworth was a master of the meaningful bowling change or disconcerting field adjustment, and could often affect the course of a match just by ratcheting up the psychological pressure on the opposition. He was also a superb man-manager who could get the best out of even the most difficult characters by applying equal measures of empathy, common sense and firmhandedness. While he undoubtedly benefited from having a strong team to nurture – with players including Geoffrey Boycott, John Edrich, Basil D’Oliveira, Derek Underwood and John Snow at his disposal – he also ensured that his players displayed tremendous spirit.  Success came not only with England but, in exile from Yorkshire, in county cricket with Leicestershire, where as captain in the early 70s he turned an over-relaxed, unambitious side into a trophy-winning outfit. Later he returned to Yorkshire as their cricket manager and had a spell as England manager, although in both roles he had noticeably less success than on the pitch. Born in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, Raymond was the only child of Ida and Fred Illingworth. When he was four the family moved down the road to Farsley and his father, a cabinet maker, fashioned Raymond’s first cricket bat in his workshop. Determined to be a sportsman, at 11 he refused even to sit exams for grammar school and at 14 was apprenticed to his father, allowing him days off to play cricket for Farsley in the Bradford League. Much of his national service in the RAF was spent on the cricket field, including for the Combined Services, and he made his Yorkshire debut aged 19 in 1951, scoring 56 in his first innings. The county side of the era was a collection of hard, self-serving Yorkshiremen with acid tongues and zero sympathy for any new boy – “no word of encouragement, no helpful tips, no pat on the back … and heaven help you if things went wrong,” he recalled. It toughened him up quickly, but was a dispiriting experience that informed the nature of his later captaincy, which he aimed to make more inclusive. He was especially influenced by the appointment in 1958 of a more soft-focused but strong-minded captain, Ronnie Burnet, who promoted camaraderie rather than internal strife – and as a result won Yorkshire the County Championship in 1959 for the first time in a decade. That season was one of Illingworth’s best, and in the previous year he had made a quiet England debut in the fourth Test against New Zealand at Old Trafford. He had to wait a year for his next match, against India, and was then picked for the 1959-60 tour to the West Indies. For a number of years, however, he rarely felt secure of selection, and from mid-1963 to the summer of 1967 was hardly in the team at all. Yet by 1969, in his 31st Test, he had become England captain. That first match as skipper arrived at the age of 37 after the incumbent, Colin Cowdrey, snapped an achilles tendon. Illingworth stepped in for the three-Test home series against West Indies and provided a dynamic counterpoint to Cowdrey’s diffident style. England won the first match at Old Trafford and he scored his first Test hundred in the second drawn game at Lord’s, while in victory in the third at Headingley, where every decision he made seemed to reap rewards, he had one of his finest hours as captain. As a consequence he was reappointed for a second series that summer, against New Zealand, which England won 2-0. In 1970 Illingworth was at the helm for an unofficial five-match home series against a strong Rest of the World side, which England lost 4-1. He continued as captain for the 1970-71 Ashes tour, and thanks in great part to his shrewd, combative leadership, England won the Ashes for the first time in more than a decade. Much of that exhausting seven-match series was played under intense pressure, particularly during the decisive last Test at Sydney, which England managed to win without Boycott and, for the latter half of the match, minus Snow, who had broken a finger. In Australia’s first innings Illingworth had shown his mettle by marching his players off the pitch when spectators bombarded Snow with bottles. Despite England’s tour manager, David Clark, trying to order Illingworth back on to the field, he stood firm and refused to resume until order had been restored. He completed that winter tour with a 1-0 win against New Zealand, followed with victory by the same margin at home to Pakistan in 1971 and, after a shock 1-0 defeat to India in the same summer, retained the Ashes at home the next year with a 2-2 series draw, a feat that earned him appointment as CBE. By then aged 40 and thoroughly drained by two combative Ashes series, he made himself unavailable for the 1972-73 tour to Pakistan and India, but was back in charge for two home series against New Zealand and West Indies in 1973. England won comfortably against New Zealand but found themselves in unexpected trouble against West Indies, and during the last game of the three-match series at Lord’s, Illingworth was told he would not be captain for the forthcoming winter tour to the Caribbean. His side lost that Lord’s match – and with it the series, 2-0. But as the decision had been taken before its outcome, he felt the move had been “political” a result perhaps of a feeling among the selectors that he was too much in the players’ camp and not enough in theirs. Illingworth had led his country 31 times between 1969 and 1973 and had lost just five Tests over the period, winning 12 and drawing 14. Of the nine series in which he was captain he was victorious in six, winning his first five series in a row without conceding a match against any opposition. Moreover, in 61 Tests he had made a significant contribution as an all-rounder, averaging 23.24 with the bat and 31.20 with the ball. A tight, thoughtful off-spinner, he was also a solid, orthodox batsman who could block or swing as the state of the game required, and while he could hardly be termed a “great” in any one department, he arguably deserved that tag when his complete package of bowling, batting, fielding and captaincy was taken into account. After he lost his England place with the captaincy, Illingworth returned to focus on county cricket. He had expected to see his days out with Yorkshire, but in 1968, after 17 years in which he had been a key member of seven County Championship-winning sides, his request for a three-year contract was refused and so he left for Leicestershire, who had asked him to be their skipper. His new county had never won anything when he joined them in 1969, but Illingworth engineered a dramatic transformation. Within three years they had taken their first title – the Benson & Hedges Cup in 1972 – and under his captaincy they also won the John Player League in 1974, the County Championship and Benson Hedges Cup in 1975, and the John Player League again in 1977. After 10 happy years at Leicestershire, in 1979 he accepted an offer from Yorkshire to become their cricket manager, allowing him to retire as a player. But it was a backroom position dogged by internal disputes, and after a poor start to the 1982 season Illingworth felt compelled to come out of retirement to captain the side at the age of 50. The following year Yorkshire won the John Player League under his command, but they also finished bottom of the County Championship, and he resigned all his roles in 1984, having played 787 first class matches, the ninth highest tally of all time. He took 2,072 wickets at 20.27 in his first class career with a best of nine for 42, and scored 24,134 runs at 28.06 with a highest score of 162. After a decade of freelance media work, Illingworth became England’s chairman of selectors in 1994, a year later also taking on the job of manager. He inherited a weak team captained by Michael Atherton, but did not forge an easy relationship with a new generation of players, and found there was little he could do to make a difference. He left the job after three years and settled down to a modest life of quiet retirement, which included regular golf and family holidays in Spain. In 1958 he married Shirley Milnes. Following her death from cancer in March 2021, and suffering from cancer himself, he backed calls for the right to assisted dying. He is survived by their two daughters, Diane and Vicky.

12/27/2021,"On a Monday afternoon, late last summer, my eight-year-old daughter and I headed to Bronte beach after school. The ocean was wild, churning with whitewater, and more riled up than I had ever seen it. We decided to play it safe and have a dip in the ocean pool instead. It was not its usual tranquil oasis. Waves crashed over the ocean side, sending out swells that spread across the water. We initially hung out in the deep end, watching mesmerised, as daredevil teenagers standing on the ledge between the pool and the sea held onto barrier ropes to see if they could withstand the force of the waves. None could.  We retreated to the shallow end, near the entrance. It seemed like one of the safest spots. We stood a few meters from the steps, submerged in the water, as we overlooked the dramatic view. We didn’t notice a huge wave break over the far end. It surged through to the back of the pool before receding in a powerful rip. We were standing directly in its path. Suddenly, the wave lifted my daughter up and pulled her over the edge of the pool towards the ocean. She started shouting and tried to cling to a pole. I can still picture her suspended horizontally between pool and ocean as she held on. I was still on my feet and in that nanosecond, I miraculously managed to grab on to the back of her swimsuit. I was standing in the pool and was sure I had managed to stop her from going over, but in the next devastating instant, still clutching fast to her swimsuit, the rip dragged us both headfirst over the ledge, over the sharp rocks, and straight into the whirling ocean. In the sea I lost my hold on my daughter. We were churned among the waves and rocks. She was further out than I was. Her head came up above the surface and I prayed I could reach her before the next wave swallowed us. It was the only thought animating my whole body: I have to get to her. That, and the dank fear at the pit of my stomach. My daughter drifted even further out to sea and as I was coming up for air, I heard a swimmer – I had no idea where he came from – call out to her from the ocean: “Don’t move darling. I got you, don’t worry. I got you …” A few moments later, as I struggled to get back to the pool, a hand appeared for me. I was pushed back a few times by the waves, but I was hoisted back to the ledge by onlookers who had gathered to help us. On the walkway ahead, I heard my daughter screaming out for me. She didn’t know if I had made it. I scooped her up in my arms, holding back my tears. Lifeguards arrived, ordered everyone out and closed down the pool. Our cuts and bruises were tended and I felt a quiet, stunned gratitude for the kindness of strangers. For days afterwards, the image of my daughter and I going over the edge returned relentlessly. But I was glad I had gone over with her, because seeing her pulled into the ocean alone would have been unbearable. I had been unable to save my own child, but at least I was with her. We only realised how banged up we were after emerging from the water. In the ocean we were only concerned with survival. The whole episode lasted minutes, though I lost track of time. In the weeks and even months that followed, we could not pass the pool without feeling a tremor of terror. Any turbulence in the water and my daughter refused to approach, her body tightening as she saw the waves break on the shore. For now, each small step towards the ocean feels like a leap of faith, an embrace of the future. When I least expect it, the words I heard at one of the most vulnerable moments in our life, “I got you” return and wash over me like an unexpected gift – a promise.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"A day at the beach: ‘In the sea, I lost my hold on my daughter’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/27/a-day-at-the-beach-in-the-sea-i-lost-my-hold-on-my-daughter
12/27/2021,"As the sun beat down on the throng massed outside Kabul airport, Najia Babakarkhail willed herself into silence, her face hidden by a makeshift disguise. Taliban fighters, armed with AK-47s, clad in black, were scanning the crowd where Babakarkhail, her daughter, and twin granddaughters stood, three generations of Afghan women all desperate to flee the recently fallen capital.  Babakarkhail knew one small slip would betray them. She was a high-value target and easily recognisable to the Taliban. An Afghan politician and activist, outspoken on issues of social justice, her face had been regularly splashed across television and the papers in her province of Paktika, in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban had already killed her brother and bodyguard. They had issued warnings directly to Babakarkhail herself. “So I wore sunglasses and I wore my skirt on my head,” she told the Guardian via an interpreter. “I was covering from everyone, and even I was not talking, I was afraid someone would recognise my voice.” For a week-and-a-half after the Taliban’s sudden capture of the capital, her family of seven had hid in their Kabul home, waiting for an inevitable knock on the door. “‘They can do anything, they will kill us’, I was thinking like this,” she said. “I was not afraid of death, but I was afraid for my family, I couldn’t see my family in danger.” Babakarkhail’s lifeline came from an unlikely source. Half a world away, in Australia, members of a small, unofficial group calling itself the 21st Kabul Lancers reached out to Babakarkhail’s daughter, Walwala Sayed, after she applied for a visa in her desperation to escape Afghanistan. The Lancers, all Australian and Afghan military and government figures, began working quietly as the Taliban’s march through Afghanistan gained momentum earlier this year. They have so far helped more than 300 people, including Australian citizens and residents, flee Afghanistan and reach Australia. The message the Lancers gave Walwala and her family was clear: they had a chance to escape to Australia. But it meant braving the chaos of Hamid Karzai International Airport to reach Australian soldiers. The family were told to wear specific coloured-headscarves, which would alert the Australians to their identity. The Lancers dispatched a driver to their house to ferry them to the airport. When they arrived, the crowds and chaos were too much. Taliban fighters were everywhere, some shooting into the sky. “I was crying, that was a very difficult time,” Walwala said. “So my mother told me to tell them ‘we are not going, it is better to stay here rather than dying outside of the airport’.” The Lancers convinced them to try again. Walwala remembers her twin daughters crying desperately, their skin frying in the relentless sun. One of the girls collapsed in the heat. “I said to them ‘sorry, we can’t come, it’s too dangerous. It’s impossible’,” she said. As night descended, the Lancers tried once more. The family were given coordinates for a bus and told to look out for its lights in the early morning darkness. The army were then sent to find the bus and ask for Babakarkhail’s family. Miraculously, the plan worked. The family were whisked to the airport, flown from Afghanistan, and eventually arrived in Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The story of the Lancers is remarkable, but one not told officially by the Australian government. Forming as a “private and personal humanitarian venture to assist friends and acquaintances”, the group’s work is done independently. The Lancers have helped Australian-trained Afghan soldiers, interpreters, journalists and politicians flee Afghanistan, using local contacts and maintaining communication channels with a network of officials working on the evacuation. They provided escorts to transport targets via foot or vehicle. Groups were advised to carry bright coloured scarfs or umbrellas to help security forces identify them once they arrived at the airport. The group’s work includes helping Afghans bypass Taliban checkpoints, hide in safehouses, and link up with Coalition troops at Kabul airport. “The fall of Afghanistan was an unprecedented and extraordinary situation, met with acts of bravery, courage, and heroism from the Afghan people, the ADF, and Australian government officials and our allied mission partners,” one member tells Guardian Australia on condition of anonymity. “There are many who have stories of escape from Afghanistan, but even more stories continuing of those surviving in Afghanistan and those settling across the world and Australia.” As the Taliban entered Kabul, high-ranking defence officials were in Kabul’s Ministry of Defence building, holding their usual morning meetings. No one imagined the Kabul would take the city so quickly. One official, who cannot be identified to avoid endangering his family, remembers being in the room with president Ashraf Ghani’s defence minister, Bismillah Khan, when he realised Ghani had fled the country. It soon became clear the government had collapsed. “When we realised that the president is not more there, he left Afghanistan … he was the man who was commanding everything,” he told Guardian Australia. “So when he escaped, then the leadership of the Ministry of Defence said that now everything is all up, so we should not kill the people, because inside the Kabul city, it was very difficult to fight against Taliban.” The official quickly began to fear for his own life. He fled with the defence minister, and managed to get on a flight to Uzbekistan. His family were trapped in Kabul. “That day was very difficult to move anywhere, but I was talking to my mum and brothers, and I told them to be inside the house, don’t go anywhere,” he said. “After the Taliban started searching our place, one day they were coming to take the car, one day they were coming to take the weapons. And every day they keep coming. Even still they are searching, they are coming, they are asking especially for me.” The official managed to find the Lancers through an Australian who had previously advised the Afghan Ministry of Defence. The Lancers assisted a broader government effort to get him and other senior officers to fly from Uzbekistan to Australia. “All of them they have been evacuated by [the Lancers] to their Australia,” he said. Those who have escaped are hugely thankful to the Lancers and Australia for getting them to safety. But they also fear for their friends, family, and for Afghanistan under Taliban rule. “Everything was just destroyed in one day,” Babakarkhail said. “It’s very difficult. Even now I am not feeling good. I can’t stop thinking about my country, what will happen to our people, what will happen to our government. Why all the world is silent? Why no one is talking about our country?”",News/Australia news,‘They will kill us’: how joint Afghan Australian group whisked female activist to safety as Taliban seized Kabul,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/27/they-will-kill-us-how-joint-afghan-australian-group-whisked-female-activist-to-safety-as-taliban-seized-kabul
12/27/2021,"Just as we enter the final days of 2021, along comes another very fine homegrown production to cap off a bumper year for Australian television. The first original series from streaming platform Binge, Love Me is a classy Melbourne-set drama directed by Emma Freeman (Stateless, Glitch) and written by Alison Bell, Leon Ford, Adele Vuko and Blake Ayshford. Adapted from the Swedish series Älska mig, it’s a romantic drama with a familial twist – we don’t realise the three distinct main characters whom the show follows are related until they congregate around the dinner table.  We’re first introduced to Clara (Bojana Novakovic), in her late 30s, while she’s on a date with a bloke she met on an app, who discusses “ethical non-monogamy” over breakfast before pointing out she’s underpaid her portion of the bill by 50 cents. Focus shifts to Aaron (William Lodder), a 20-something law student who misses his bus to uni due to sexy times with his girlfriend (Shalom Brune-Franklin), though we soon learn he’s not the reckless, carefree type; he takes his schooling seriously. Finally we meet the middle-aged Glenn (Hugo Weaving) while he’s booking a vacation at a travel planner for himself and his wife. After he balks at a $20,000 price tag, the lady behind the desk informs him there are “gold, silver or bronze” packages, to which Glenn returns one of those thinking-out-loud responses: “How about copper? Or tin?” The screenwriters want us to know that these characters are individuals first and foremost, and a family unit second. Glenn’s wife and the kids’ mother Christine (Sarah Peirse) is headstrong and standoffish – giving the script a prickly dimension – but also chronically ill and not long for this world. Describing the subsequent narrative as one about “finding yourself” and “learning to love again” sounds a little twee, but it’s nevertheless apt, the former applying particularly to Aaron (the youngest of the trio) and the latter to Glenn, who may be soon to experience a new romantic opportunity, or at least a new friend. All the characters are vividly detailed and well acted, with Clara the most dynamic – brought to life in an affably hard-nosed way by Novakovic, and whom we really root for: we want her to find someone decent. The ever-reliable Weaving begins in downcast mode then lightens up, playing an avuncular kind of everyman, at one point describing himself as “just like anybody”. Lodder plays the brasher and more intemperate – perhaps less likable – member of the bunch, as a man who lacks maturity and life experience but is gradually coming into his own, learning some things the hard way. Love Me is more middle class in its Melbourne-ness than, say, the scuzzier and cooler Jack Irish or The Secret Life of Us, which are more likely to visit laneways and dimly lit bars. The cinematographer Earle Dresner (who shot The Newsreader, 2067 and The Commons) filters the city through a handsome lens, making even the brown and sludgy Yarra River – hardly a beatific body of water (I can say that, as a proud Melbournian) – look crisp and almost pretty. The drama is peppered with small moments that paint larger impressions of the people involved, fleshing characters out with lightness of touch – a joke, or some badinage, or a humorously relatable circumstance offsetting the heavier moments. Freeman et al do a fine job illustrating fresh sparks of romance: those early, exciting moments when the person in front of or next to us represents a universe of potential, with all the risks, uncertainties and exhilaration that comes with getting to know somebody new. Four episodes in (with two remaining that I haven’t seen), the character arcs are broad and the various story tangents loosely defined; this is a show that greatly prioritises people over plotlines. At times I wanted a little more flair in the writing and presentation, though Love Me has an endearing level-headed quality, and a gentle way of probing characters for information. In the fourth episode, for instance, Clara mishears the question “are you hungry?” as “are you happy?”, triggering a more meaningful exchange than one about breakfast. The writers don’t dwell on that moment for long, breezing into the next scene, which typifies their approach: avoiding the signposting of “important” moments. Despite the polished aesthetic, it all comes across quite effortlessly. Buoyed by thoughtfully developed characters and relatable circumstances, the series has a knack for making conceptually ordinary or even unappealing things interesting. It even makes the Yarra look nice.

12/27/2021,"For Sarah Clifton-Bligh, the most useful thing to have when you’re travelling is an older brother who plays rugby. Sydney-based Clifton-Bligh is fitter than most 17-year-olds. She’s a member of the junior athletics development squad and hopes to make the national team in racing and throwing sports. She has travelled around Australia and the world with her family for holidays and athletics meets.  Clifton-Bligh also has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair most of the time. She can do incredible manoeuvres in her chair, and with the aid of ankle-foot orthoses and forearm crutches she can take a few steps – a small thing that makes a vast amount of difference when the family goes places – but too many stairs are an issue. “The worst place I’ve been was the New York subway,” Clifton-Bligh says. “There are not a lot of lifts in that subway system. There were these metal stairs and there was a platform and then there were another two flights of stairs. It was so bad.” Clifton-Bligh’s mother, Meredith Jordan, says “we were very lucky that we had a teenage son who could just fling Sarah over his shoulder and carry her up”. “It would be pretty challenging if you were doing it on your own.” One in six people in Australia have a disability – about 4.4 million of us – including half of people aged over 65. Many of those people – at least 44% of them – travel for pleasure. But disabled people routinely struggle to have their access needs met, and trying to organise a trip away comes with significant additional burdens, including a substantial investment of time and energy into extra layers of planning, and often additional costs. The data on accessible tourism across Australia is patchy. The latest comprehensive research, conducted in 2018 for the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, focused mainly on Victoria and Queensland. It estimated that domestic travellers with access needs numbered some 3.4 million people. And it’s not just disabled people, but also their families, friends and carers who are looking for accessible accommodation, experiences and services. As a market, it could be worth up to $8bn. The commission’s research also found Australian tourism providers could being doing much more. Surveys showed 23% of non-travelling disabled people found travel “so stressful it’s not worth it” and 22% found it “just too hard”. “There is a lack of useful and accurate information in the public domain that allows disabled people to plan travel,” says Dale Reardon, the founder of the accessible travel consultancy Travel For All. Reardon is blind and usually travels with a guide dog. He has made it his business to help other companies identify and improve their accessibility features and services. “Lots of accommodation sites want the tick to say they’re ‘fully accessible’, but that’s a meaningless phrase,” Reardon says. “A property perfect for a blind person may be no good for a person in a wheelchair. It’s not all about ramps or guide dogs.” Customer service for someone who is autistic, for example, might require staff having the right training, a flexible attitude and being empowered to bend the rules or make decisions on the spot. “We’re struggling to persuade a lot of businesses that our money is just as good as anyone else’s,” Reardon says. “Businesses often see accessibility almost as a charitable thing. Whereas we say, you can make as much money out of us as you can from everyone else. And we are very loyal customers.” The challenges with accommodation can be complex. Some places represent themselves as “fully accessible” when they are only partially so. Other places do not communicate their accessibility features at all – a common issue on Airbnb, which allows hosts to list features like grab rails, step-free entrances and step-free bathrooms, but few choose to do so. Disabled people have also reported being turned away from accommodation even when their needs could be met with a few simple, inexpensive compromises. Air travel can be particularly stressful. Wheelchair users are often required to change out of their own chairs on planes, with the chairs stored as luggage, running the risk of damage to expensive equipment due to mishandling. Toilets on planes are not accessible, with cramped conditions making it difficult for carers to assist, requiring some disabled travellers to fast before flying so they don’t need to use the onboard bathrooms. On the ground, wheelchair accessible taxis can be scarce the further away from the cities you go – and many taxi and Uber drivers refuse people with assistance animals, even though it is illegal to do so. There’s also the question of cost. The national disability insurance scheme funds services it deems “reasonable and necessary” insofar as they are related to a person’s disability, but travel, accommodation, food and entertainment don’t usually meet those criteria, even though many argue holidays are a health necessity. Those who require a support worker to travel with them usually find themselves footing the bill for an extra person on their trip. There are restrictions on the disability pension for recipients travelling internationally, with payments cutting off after 28 days out of the country, with some exceptions. Serena Ovens, the chief executive of the Physical Disability Council of New South Wales, says all this can make the process of going on holiday incredibly stressful. “If you can imagine having to ask 10, 20 times a day for accessibility adjustments, to have to constantly contact places and explain what your requirements are and have them treated as extraordinary – that’s not relaxation,” Ovens says. “That’s not a holiday.” One of the most persistent issues Clifton-Bligh and her family encounter is the lack of a shower chair. “You would think that would be something that wouldn’t be such a big deal, but it is,” Jordan says. “Which is why we just cracked and bought one. It can be taken apart and we take it with us.” Clifton-Bligh says she’s mostly been lucky with how she’s treated when flying – with the exception of a patronising experience at Dubai airport during a layover some years ago, in which she says she was not allowed to use her chair and was required to stay in a designated holding area, away from the duty-free shopping she’d been looking forward to, under the eye of an ever-present attendant. Clifton-Bligh has heard other horror stories from the disability community, too. “Sometimes the chairs get damaged on planes,” she says. Jordan adds: “We know people who’ve been bumped off planes, who’ve had to crawl down the aisle to the bathrooms.” The key to getting everything to work out, Jordan says, is starting a dialogue early. “When I book things, I will always send a big email saying this is what it’s for, this is what Sarah can do, she has a wheelchair, etc. I send a whole lot of context so I can get as much information about where we’re staying before we leave. And once I find somewhere that works, we go back there. “It’s just a matter of trying to do it significantly in advance, making sure you communicate with the accommodation provider and that they know what we want, and then if it’s not quite there, making it work.” Reardon urges businesses not to be afraid of the accessible tourism market. “They really are people of all shapes, sizes and abilities. And you probably have people staying with you already that you don’t know about who could benefit from extra information or accessibility. Give travellers very detailed information about your property so they can decide for themselves whether it suits their needs.” And don’t leave accessibility considerations to the last minute: “Some things that might have been very easy to do in the beginning are very difficult later on.” Ovens argues that investing in accessibility is good business sense. “For every person with a disability who doesn’t travel because of the logistical challenges, you have a family, you have carers, you have friends who did not travel either,” she says.",News/Australia news,‘You can make money out of us’: the disabled people demanding more accessible travel and tourism ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/27/you-can-make-money-out-of-us-the-disabled-people-demanding-more-accessible-travel-and-tourism
