4/23/2022,"As Russia’s economy teeters on the brink of collapse, its fallout could prove even more consequential than perhaps initially thought. The freezing of the Russian Central Bank’s assets and the weaponisation of the US dollar has not only caused Vladimir Putin’s “Fortress Russia” plan to crumble, but also stoked worries that the world economy has crossed the Rubicon. Some in global finance, including the International Monetary Fund, fear the onslaught of Western sanctions means the global economy is splitting into camps in the wake of Russia’s invasion, one led by the US and the other by China, with disastrous consequences. They believe the world economy is fracturing into two parts. Russia will be forced to move away from Western finance, tech and the US dollar, perhaps into Chinese President Xi Jinping’s arms, while others could follow to avoid being next. “The war also increases the risk of a more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies,” IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said last week as he delivered a grim set of global economic forecasts in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. He said this “tectonic shift” where trade and standards separate into blocks would be a “disaster” for the global economy. It would be “a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years”, Gourinchas added. While the big thinkers in economics appear to agree that a fundamental shift is underway in the global economy, they remain divided over what kind of post-Covid, post-Ukraine war world will emerge. Some believe the war will cause economic fragmentation and the demise of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency; others swat away the idea that such a seismic shift is underway. Dario Perkins, managing director of global macro at TS Lombard, says: “We always thought this splintering of the global economy into different trade blocs - the US, Asia and Europe in the middle - was going to happen but we’ve had that accelerated. “Some of these trends will be accelerated, particularly [given] you are drawing Russia, China, India and other countries closer together. They're starting to use the renminbi in bilateral trade instead of the dollar.” Government-imposed financial sanctions taken against Russia by the West have been sweeping and devastating, while individual companies have delivered a blow by pulling their operations out of the country. There are worries this could force Russia and others to seek alternatives to a global financial system dominated by the West and its financial heavyweights. In addition to personal sanctions against Putin and his inner circle of oligarchs and ministers, the West targeted its lenders and central bank. Once considered a “nuclear” option, a number of Russian banks were ejected from the Swift global payments messaging system, making it far harder for them to do business and make cross-border payments. Visa and Mastercard also suspended their operations in the country, blocking access to new cards issued by the payment giants. Meanwhile, following the invasion, the West froze half of the Russian central bank’s foreign currency and gold reserves, hindering Moscow’s ability to prop up the rouble and its banking system. Under Putin’s Fortress Russia plan to insulate it from sanctions, Moscow had built up a $640bn war chest of foreign reserves. The freezing of these reserves was considered a game-changing move, in an unexpected and powerful escalation of the financial siege on Russia. It prompted a plunge in the rouble and the introduction of capital controls in the country. Some fear this weaponisation of finance and the US dollar has long-term consequences, perhaps luring countries to a new rival sphere headed by China. Russian banks are turning to alternatives to the Belgium-based Swift in order to smooth cross-border payments. Its central bank has its own system it has already offered India for rouble payments, while China also has an alternative that could rival Swift. Moscow’s lenders have turned to China’s payment giant UnionPay to help them issue debit and credit cards after Visa and Mastercard joined the mass exodus of Western brands from Russia. The two American payment heavyweights accounted for 70pc of the Russian debit card market but the Kremlin created its own system, Mir, following the Crimea annexation. Following the departure of Visa and Mastercard, Russian banks and Mir hoped to team up with UnionPay, which has been fast gaining ground outside of China in recent years, to issue cards. However, reports suggested last week that UnionPay is getting cold feet, fearing that it will be dragged into Western sanctions. Fears of a split have also rekindled the long-running debate over whether the US dollar is at risk of losing its status as the world’s reserve currency. “After this war is over, ‘money’ will never be the same again,” said Zoltan Pozsar at Credit Suisse as he declared a “new world (monetary) order” following the freezing of the Russian central bank’s reserves. The US dollar has been dominant across the globe since the second world war, becoming the world’s reserve currency. This is the currency held most by central banks as part of foreign reserves and financial institutions to help facilitate global trade. Countries, including China, have amassed almost $13 trillion in foreign reserves - around 60pc in dollars. As the sanctions on Russia have shown, however, those reserves could suddenly become useless if they are paralysed by the West. Dollars have also been vital for global trade, being used for everything from invoicing in international business to buying commodities, such as oil. Russia, however, claims several buyers have agreed to pay for its gas in roubles, while Saudi Arabia is reportedly considering accepting China’s currency instead of dollars for oil sales to Beijing amid tensions with Washington. “This was a weapon that the US had been increasingly using,” says Perkins. “There's always been warnings going back at least a decade, saying ‘you can't keep doing this over and over again’ because eventually you get to a point where you change the status of the dollar. It’s just this is so high profile.” He says there is now a “turning point”, but highlights that any move away from the dollar would be slow moving. Others are sceptical that such a major transformation is in the works, however. Prof Barry Eichengreen, an expert at University of California, Berkeley, says the odds of this weaponisation threatening the dollar’s status are low given the lack of a credible alternative. “The US was joined by the euro area, the UK, and Japan, among others, in imposing financial sanctions,” he says, adding that the Chinese renminbi is “an unattractive alternative to most countries”. “Only governments in extremis, such as Russia's, are likely to significantly increase their reliance on China's currency.” Meanwhile Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, says the concept of a reserve currency will become less important as world trade “is likely to become less global over time”. “If you are doing less global trade, then the importance of a global invoicing currency is less and central banks don't need to hold quite so much in foreign exchange reserves.” He believes the global economy is not going through a splintering but a localisation effect where digitisation reduces the need for physical trade and production moves closer to consumers, such as clean energy over imported gas. “A localisation process is something which doesn’t necessarily split the world into two, it splits the world into 196.”",World/The Telegraph,"As Fortress Russia crumbles, the global economy faces a new world order",https://news.yahoo.com/fortress-russia-crumbles-global-economy-082411869.html
4/23/2022,"After Magic Johnson retired from the NBA, one of his first moves was to open a movie theater in Los Angeles. Magic wanted to build businesses in Black neighborhoods but knew it would be in the heart of gang warfare. He convinced gang leaders that violence around the theater would hurt everybody. The new docuseries about the life and career of Magic Johnson, ""They Call Me Magic,"" is now streaming on Apple TV+ and Episode 4 centers on the basketball legend's life after the NBA. In the 30 years since retiring, Johnson has become a successful businessperson, and one of his first moves was to negotiate with gang leaders in LA to drop their violence for the sake of the neighborhood. After Johnson was diagnosed with HIV and initially retired from the NBA in 1991, he wasn't sure what to do next in his life. When the Rodney King riots broke out in Los Angeles in 1992, Magic says he was convinced to build his businesses in Black neighborhoods. ""When I think about Rodney King and the rioting, what I didn't like was that we tore up our own community,"" Johnson says in the series. ""The Black community, we set our own businesses on fire, and that hurt South Central, Compton. That hurt so many communities."" Johnson noted that community leaders immediately started reaching out to him. ""That was the start of something for me that had to change,"" Johnson said. ""I said, OK. I've got to build my businesses in urban America. If you don't make a difference in the Black community, that doesn't matter that you're winning all those championships."" Johnson's first project was to build a movie theater in South LA. But he also knew there was a big gang problem in that area that could derail the entire project. ""We knew what everybody was thinking; it's in the middle of the Bloods and the Crips,"" Johnson said. ""One incident could destroy our business, and everybody was thinking it was going to happen. That's what really made me mad."" To prove the naysayers wrong, Magic scheduled a breakfast meeting with the leaders of both gangs. According to Johnson's business partner Ken Lombard, about 35 gang members showed up. Here is how Magic recounts the meeting: ""I said, 'I am not here to disrespect either one of you. What I am here for is to say, this theater is going to help the entire Black community. I want you to come. I want your families to come. But you guys gotta agree that we can't have violence, outside or inside that theater. And I am creating jobs. So, if you guys got some guys who want to work, I will employ them."" Lombard noted that the gang members respected Johnson because they were Lakers fans and then added, ""We were off to the races.""

4/23/2022,"Sure, everyone poops—but that doesn’t mean we like to talk about it or acknowledge it in any way, shape, or form. It also doesn’t change the fact that sometimes a trip to the bathroom can leave us scratching our heads, because of, well, our poop’s many shapes and forms. Well, there’s something called the Bristol Stool Chart that breaks down all the different types of poop you can have—and it’s pretty cool. “Your bowel movements are the only real marker you have about what your GI health is like,” says Anish Sheth, M.D., a board-certified gastroenterologist at Penn Medicine’s Center for Digestive Health. Getting familiar with what’s normal for you in terms of stool shape, consistency, and texture can help you better take care of your body and pick up on any changes that may signal a problem. And, if something is off with your health, being able to reference the Bristol Stool Chart ensures that both you and your doctor are on the same page about what, exactly, is landing in the toilet. Here’s what you need to know about this handy reference guide—and what your poop says about you. The Bristol Stool Chart, aka the Bristol Stool Form Scale or Bristol Stool Scale, is a visual guide to the different types of poop you can have. “We use it to classify stools and the character of stools,” says Rudolph Bedford, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. The chart is “well-validated” and breaks poop down into seven different types based on consistency, “from hard and pellet-like to soft and mushy,” says Randy Meisner, M.D., a gastroenterologist with Spectrum Health. “It describes a wide variety of what are considered normal bowel movements,” he adds. The Bristol Stool Chart helps doctors and patients speak the same language when talking about BMs, explains Lukasz Kwapisz, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine—gastroenterology at Baylor College of Medicine. “It really helps clinicians—in most cases, gastroenterologists or primary care physicians—to have an understanding of what type of bowel movements patients are having,” he says. “This allows the doctors to tailor a treatment plan to improve the consistency and help alleviate patients’ concerns.” Typically, patients are shown the chart and asked to ID the number of the stool they’ve been experiencing. “It’s hard to describe poop,” points out Ellen Stein, M.D., a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. “It’s a lot easier to point to it.” Under the Bristol Stool Chart, poop is classified into seven distinct categories. Here’s a breakdown. Hard poop will often come out in separate lumps and can be painful to pass. When poop is this texture (similar to pebbles), it’s a sign that it sat in the large intestine and colon for an extended period of time. In other words, this type of stool often signals that you’re constipated. If this is commonly what you see in the toilet—and you aren’t suffering from another illness that comes with funky bowels—you may have a gastrointestinal condition called chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC. Drinking more water, making exercise part of your daily routine, and slowly adding more fiber to your diet may help. Firm stools that are connected but still lumpy can also be a sign of constipation. This signals that your waste has hung around in the intestine long enough to become dried out, but not so long that it’s dry enough to break into smaller pieces, according to UnityPoint Health experts. You can try eating more of these foods to relieve constipation to get things moving, but if nothing seems to help, ask your doc if a prescription medication is a good fit for you. If this describes what you’re used to seeing when you go to the bathroom, then congrats! This is considered to be a healthy stool, according to the Bristol Stool Chart, a tool used by medical professionals and dietitians. The cracks, however, do indicate that you may be a bit dehydrated. Gastroenterologist Robyn Karlstadt, M.D., suggests drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily to keep your GI health in tip-top shape. Doctors consider this type of stool (think: sausage- or snake-shaped) to be the gold standard—especially when it’s also medium to light brown in color and remains intact as it is flushed. If this is what your poop looks like, give yourself a pat on the back because it’s a clear sign you’re eating a wholesome diet and staying nice and hydrated. This is considered to be a slightly loose stool, but it’s fairly common for folks who have bowel movements two or three times a day, typically after eating a main meal, UnityPoint Health medical experts say. (If this is normal for you, and it’s soft and passes comfortably, consider it A-OK.) When waste passes through the colon quickly, this texture of poop is often the result. According to the Bristol Stool Chart, fuzzy, jagged pieces may indicate inflammation of the bowel or an inflammatory bowel disease like ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. It can also indicate a major change in your diet. Check in with your doc to make sure there’s no reason to be concerned. (Sure, it can feel like an embarrassing conversation, but it’s always best to err on the side of caution and physicians used to these types of questions.) This advanced stage of diarrhea occurs when the small intestine is irritated. There are numerous causes of this type of stool, including viruses and bacteria, digestive disorders, and lactose intolerance. Sometimes eating or drinking things with lots of fructose or artificial sweeteners, or starting a new medication can be the cause, according to the Mayo Clinic. If your diarrhea lasts more than two days, contact your doctor. Everybody has their own stool consistency that’s considered “normal” for them. But, in general, a type 3 or 4 is best, Dr. Stein says. “Four is kind of a soft serve consistency,” she explains. “It’s easy to pass and smooth. That’s considered ideal.” Having this poop indicates that you’re well hydrated, but it’s not as liquidy as diarrhea, which suggests you’re passing things too quickly through your GI tract, she says. Again, everyone’s normal BMs are different. Because of this, experts say it’s tough to say for sure what type of poop should send you running for the doctor. “A good general rule of thumb is that if there is a change in bowel habits—whether stool frequency or consistency—that is ongoing for more than a few days, this would be a good time to see your doctor to discuss,” Dr. Kwapisz says. But, he adds, if there are “red flag” symptoms like bloody poop, a fever, unexplained weight loss, uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhea, or not being able to poop at all, you should see your doctor sooner rather than later.
