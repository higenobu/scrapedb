4/22/2022,"A senior member of the Hillsong church has written an explosive letter to the church’s global board criticising the handling of complaints against its former head Brian Houston and his leadership style. John Mays, the church’s head of people and development, recommended in the letter dated 19 March that Brian Houston and his wife, Bobbie, should be permanently sacked from Hillsong, saying Brian Houston “considered himself beyond disciplinary boundaries” and defied them “without further recourse from those responsible for his discipline”. “Unfortunately, I believe this typifies the leadership that is foundational to many unhealthy people practices employed within our Church based on my observations over many years,” Mays wrote. Houston resigned on 23 March, after internal investigations found he had engaged in inappropriate conduct of “serious concern” with two women, which “breached the Hillsong Pastor’s Code of Conduct”. Mays said employees of the church were asked to believe insulting “dribble” put out by the board to explain Houston’s alleged visit to a woman’s room at a conference in 2019. He said directors involved in managing the situation should consider resigning, having “failed in their governance and fiduciary obligations”, and called for an independent inquiry into the decisions of the church’s top body. The church has undergone weeks of tension, during which at least one of the eldership has resigned, and nine of the 16 US branches of Hillsong have split from the church. Mays said “Brian and his behaviours” had placed a great deal of stress on the board members and that “these challenges would have been intensified on account of Brian’s strong, immovable, leadership disposition together with a distinct lack of personal accountability which has been allowed over many years”. In the days before Houston’s resignation, the board said it had been dealing with two complaints against him. The church said the first incident “involved inappropriate text messages” sent to a female member of staff about a decade ago. “At the time, Pastor Brian was under the influence of sleeping tablets, upon which he had developed a dependence,” it said. “He immediately apologised to the person.” An investigation into the second complaint found that Houston became disoriented at the Hillsong conference in 2019 after the consumption of anti-anxiety medication beyond the prescribed dose, along with alcohol. This resulted in him knocking on the door of a hotel room that was not his, entering the room and spending time with the female occupant. The investigation found not all parts of the complaint could be sustained, but Houston’s conduct was “of serious concern”. In his letter, Mays said there were “obvious information gaps and anomalies” in the account of the 2019 incident the board had given to staff. “I do not believe our employees have bought the narrative within the statement made in the staff meeting,” he wrote. He said the message had been met with “skepticism and mistrust despite urgings to avoid gossip and talk to leadership about any concerns”. “One insulting example (of many) is that Brian lost his room key so knocked on the lady’s door, a detail he no doubt recalls despite memory loss during the following 40 minutes. Are we really asking our staff to accept such dribble and defend our Church with such?” Suggesting that a three-month suspension from preaching and requirement that Houston abstain from alcohol would not be a sufficient response, Mays said that “by all accounts Brian considered himself beyond disciplinary boundaries and defied same without further recourse from those responsible for his discipline”. “We have been led by a leader who considers himself above normal societal expectations in a range of areas including many which might be considered mandatory in nature.” After his resignation, Houston claimed that his wife, Bobbie, was fired from her position as a global lead pastor by text message, which the church has denied. Mays wrote that he did not see Bobbie as a victim. “I believe Bobbie in her capacity as Global Senior Pastor, paid accordingly, should also be accountable for her willingness to tolerate such behaviour and defiance on the part of her co-leader,” he wrote. “I do not see her as a victim in this situation, she has a biblical, professional and corporate responsibility to ensure accountability.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Mays said the board had not followed through effectively on the penalties it had imposed on Brian Houston. “There was a finding that disciplinary action was warranted but this was accompanied with what can only be described as inept commitment to enforce,” he wrote. He said his recommendations on the future of the Houstons and the board members were made “without personal malice”, but it was “what a reasonable person might expect”. Mays made clear in the letter his principal motive in writing it was to support Hillsong employees. “There is obviously much to acknowledge in terms of Brian & Bobbie’s legacy etc. which I wholeheartedly celebrate, but that is not the purpose of this particular communication,” he said. “Please resist the temptation to minimise my thoughts on account of such … I simply ask that you consider how we might honour our employees and others by adopting better practices, both now with regard to the situation at hand, and in the future.” Mays declined to comment further to Guardian Australia, saying only: “Any communication between myself and our boards is confidential and for the benefit of our employees and church community.” Neither Hillsong nor the Houstons responded to a request for comment. The intervention by Mays illustrates a serious split within the formerly tight-knit Hillsong family. He is a longtime senior member of staff, with a number of family members employed by the organisation. The Houstons stood by the Mays family when John’s son Jason was charged with assault with an act of indecency in Australia. Jason Mays pleaded guilty in January 2020 and was given a two-year good behaviour bond. In his letter, Mays wrote: “Failure is inevitable but I am inspired by my own son Jason, who in my estimation has done everything right since he did something wrong, despite much injustice.” Jason Mays remained on staff at Hillsong after the incident, which the church justified by noting the magistrate chose not to record a conviction and that some witnesses “did not fully corroborate” the victim’s version of events. Hillsong has been widely criticised for its reliance on volunteer labour and the goodwill of its parishioner employees. In his letter, John Mays wrote that Hillsong had “become an arrogant employer,” and that “we have ‘unearned’ and often unreasonable expectations of our employees as an employer on account of their commitment to the cause”. He recommended a review of the board deliberations around the issues that led to Brian Houston’s resignation, to be undertaken by a forensic, independent, external body “with absolutely no allegiance to Hillsong” or any of its board members. “I believe that the statement provided to staff should be reviewed and modified to ensure it more authentically reveals the full circumstances of Brian’s indiscretions (subject to his and others right to privacy), the agreements entered into with aggrieved parties (again subject to individual privacy) and the decision-making process that led to such agreements. Mays also appeared to reflect on another frequent criticism of Hillsong, that it acts more as a corporate entity than a faith-based organisation. “The perception of Hillsong as a “brand” confirms that we have drifted from our true mandate as a community of believers, the Church, leaving us vulnerable to decision making processes of an unhealthy kind,” he wrote.",News/World news,Hillsong: scathing internal letter denounces church response to Brian Houston’s ‘unhealthy’ leadership,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/hillsong-scathing-internal-letter-denounces-church-response-to-brian-houstons-unhealthy-leadership
4/22/2022,"When Captain Cook spent time in Fiji in 1774, he and his crew were astounded by the “drua” – double-hulled boats that were then some of the most advanced sea vessels in the world. Elegant in their simplicity, they were created by binding together buabua trees, not with nails but by “magimagi”, or coconut fibres. Over time, this shipbuilding genius went into decline, but nearly 250 years later, Fijians re-emerged as the world’s best – not in the water this time, but on the rugby sevens field. And now, in 2022, the ancient trailblazers have again risen in the 15-a-side version of the game, courtesy of the Fijiana Drua’s debut in the women’s Super W competition. While the Fijian Drua men’s team have struggled on their way to a 1-7 record – their best players have been poached for years by Australian, New Zealand and UK teams – the women’s team have swept all before them in their inaugural Super W year, playing a brand of entertaining rugby that would make their pioneering ancestors weep with pleasure. These Drua are bound not by coconut fibres but by faith and the “veilomani” spirit – a love for each other – and they have revolutionised women’s rugby in Australia with an intoxicating brand of running rugby not seen since the Mark Ella era of the 1980s. They have comprehensively defeated the five established Australian teams and their 5-0 record – and remarkable 184-51 for and against numbers – has earned them the title of minor premiers and a place in Saturday’s grand final against the NSW Waratahs. The Waratahs are well resourced and have been the imposing powerhouse of the Super W competition – they had been undefeated since its inception – but their five-year winning streak was brutally ended by the Drua earlier this month in a 29-10 reverse, with one bewildered TV commentator exclaiming: “This is electric, this is fantastic, I can’t keep up.” The Fijiana Drua revolution began in their first Super W outing at the beginning of March when three front rowers scored their first three tries, including a 65m run by prop Karalaini Naisewa. They overwhelmed the Melbourne Rebels 66-5, leaving Mel Kawa, the disoriented Rebels captain, speechless. “What can I say? I’ve never played 80 minutes of [rugby] sevens before,” she said. “They kept coming.” The team is the most under-resourced team in the competition and their giantkilling feats have provided unbridled joy for patient fans. “We’ve known for a long time that our women are extremely talented,” says Lizann Vailasi, a Fijian Sydneysider who watched the team dismantle the Western Force at Leichhardt Oval in round three. “We knew they would compete in the Super W but they have been a revelation and we can’t stop talking about them.” Beyond jubilant Australian-Fijian fans, the impact in Fiji has been profound according to Fiji rugby union women’s development manager Vela Naucukidi. “Their games are live on TV here in Fiji every weekend, and it’s just amazing,” Naucukidi says. “It helps us who are actually working on the ground trying to develop women’s rugby in Fiji.” While some commentators have made slippery rationalisations that the Fijiana Drua are an international team playing in a provincial competition, the facts tell a different story. Only six of the team have played internationally for Fiji, while the rest of the squad have only been playing the game for between one and three years. Try-scoring machine Vitalina Nakore is a former footballer whilst the ball-handling skills of Akosita Ravato are a recent addendum to her previous career as a basketball player. Also worth noting, in the 15-a-side version of the game, Fiji are ranked 21st in the world, behind non-traditional rugby nations such as Hong Kong, Sweden, Germany and Kazakhstan. Yet the Drua’s rugby has been breathtaking across all facets of the game – high-level conditioning, physical defence, laser-like passing, instinctive and intuitive support play, slick running and clinical finishing. After games they sing hymns for their opponents. It is a total rugby package in the spirit of “the game they play in heaven”. In the final game of the regular season, when the ACT Brumbies tried to strangle the creativity of the Drua’s running game, they showed flexibility and responded with a hard-fought victory based on more traditional set pieces centred on scrums and lineouts. Captain Bitila Tawake has perhaps been the perfect representation of what the Fijiana Drua stand for. Her post match interviews are a mix of humility, shyness, gratitude and joy. Nothing phases her and she is focused on the job at hand: “First we’re just doing things one step at a time,” she says. “We didn’t expect it to be this big and we came in as underdogs in this tournament.” Along with coach Senirusi Seruvakula, Tawake is ensuring the Drua maintain their identity. “We are just doing what we do best with our own free-flowing Fijian style of game – breaking the line, offloading and support play.” Instead of streaking across the Pacific Ocean, the Fijiana Drua are streaking across Australian rugby fields. But both voyages have the same outcome – opening up new possibilities for their people. Awaiting them in the grand final are the wounded Waratahs, who are hoping for revenge and to deliver a winning send-off for their 37-year-old Fijian veteran Iliseva Batibasaga. Either way, the women’s game in Australia will never be the same again.",News/World news,‘We can’t stop talking about them’: Fijiana Drua revolutionise women’s rugby in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/we-cant-stop-talking-about-them-fijiana-drua-revolutionise-womens-rugby-in-australia
