2/26/2022,"ANKARA (Reuters) -Turkey cannot stop Russian warships accessing the Black Sea via its straits, as Ukraine has requested, due to a clause in an international pact that allows vessels to return to their home base, the Turkish foreign minister said on Friday. Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine from land, air and sea. Russian forces landed at Ukraine's Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened, but the request has put the NATO member in a difficult position as it tries to manage its Western commitments and close ties with Russia. Speaking in Kazakhstan, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey was studying Kyiv's request but said Russia had the right under the Convention to return ships to their home base, in this case the Black Sea. So even if Turkey decided after a legal process to accept Ukraine's request and close the straits to Russian warships, he said, they would only be prevented from travelling in the other direction, away from their home base into the Mediterranean. ""If countries involved in the war make a request to return their vessels to their bases, that needs to be allowed,"" the Hurriyet daily quoted Cavusoglu as saying. TURKEY'S BALANCING ACT Cavusoglu added that Turkish legal experts were still trying to determine whether the conflict in Ukraine could be defined as a war, which would allow the convention mandates to be invoked. Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, Vasyl Bodnar, said on Friday Kyiv was expecting a ""positive response"" from Ankara to its request. Cavusoglu also reiterated Ankara's opposition to imposing economic sanctions against Russia, a stance that has set Turkey apart from most of its NATO allies which have already announced such measures. President Tayyip Erdogan later said that reaction from NATO and Western countries to Russia's assault had not been decisive, adding he hoped a virtual NATO summit on Friday would lead to a more determined approach from the alliance. Turkey has cultivated good ties with both Russia and Ukraine. It has said the Russian attack is unacceptable and that it supports Ukraine's territorial integrity but has avoided using words such as ""invasion"" to describe what is happening. Ankara has pursued cooperation with Moscow on defence and energy but has also sold drones to Ukraine and inked a deal to co-produce more. It also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its annexation of Crimea in 2014.

2/26/2022,"Russia has warned of “military consequences” if Finland and Sweden join Nato, after their leaders held talks with the alliance in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign affairs spokesman, said at her weekly briefing that all members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, including Finland and Sweden, “have reaffirmed the principle that the security of one country cannot be built at the expense of the security of others”. She added: “Obviously, the accession of Finland and Sweden to Nato, which is primarily a military alliance as you well understand, would have serious military and political consequences, which would require our country to make response steps.” Her intervention came after Sanna Marin, the Finnish prime minister, and Magdalena Andersson, her Swedish counterpart, joined Nato leaders at an emergency summit to discuss the response to the crisis. Nato sources dismissed Russian suggestions that the meeting was focused on bringing Finland and Sweden on board as part of an expansion of the alliance. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato's secretary-general, said leaders instead concentrated on plans to defend the alliance from a possible Russian attack and how to support Ukraine as the conflict continues. The alliance's top officials had previously warned that it would need to reinforce its eastern flank, to prevent fighting from spilling over into a full-blown war. Alexander Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, which has been militarily neutral since the Cold War, said: ""Russia is pushing Finland closer to Nato membership. Closer than ever before. ""Our security has been partially based on an option to join. At this rate, we have no other option but to join. ""Finland's accession would strengthen the alliance and help keep northern Europe stable."" Nato membership has never enjoyed majority public support in Finland, but the Russian attack on Ukraine has seen a shift in the mood. Ms Marin, who was previously an opponent to joining the alliance, now argues the debate over membership is set to change. After the Russian threat against Helsinki, one Finnish television channel asked members of the public how they wanted to respond to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. One simply offered a middle-finger salute, replying: ""This!"" With fighting intensifying in Kyiv on Friday, Nato leaders stepped up plans to send more troops and weapons to the alliance's borders with Russia and Ukraine. “No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies,” Nato leaders said in a joint statement. “We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the alliance.” Boris Johnson told counterparts that Britain was doubling the size of its battalion to form a brigade in Estonia, as well as other deployments across the alliance. The Prime Minister also called on Nato leaders to back his plans to eject Russia from the Swift international payment system, to exert maximum pressure on Putin and his Kremlin allies. A Royal Navy destroyer set sail to the Mediterranean to join patrol vessel HMS Trent, with four additional RAF Typhoon jets being deployed to Cyprus as part of Nato air policing efforts in eastern Europe. Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales is expected to sail to Norway to take part in a Nato mission in the area. However, it could be called up as part of the alliance's high-readiness force to tackle Russian aggression. Ministers are currently discussing further deployments that could be offered to Nato's so-called defence plan, which was activated for the first time in the wake of Moscow's attack. On top of this James Heappy, the armed forces minister, revealed 1,000 British troops were on standby to support Ukraine's neighbours. ""The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine,” he said.",World/The Telegraph,Russia warns of ‘military consequences’ if Finland and Sweden join Nato,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-warns-military-consequences-finland-210632384.html
2/26/2022,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia respects Ukraine's territorial integrity and considers Russia's military action against it to be ""wrong,"" but will not impose sanctions against Moscow, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Friday. Serbia, led by Vucic, is performing a delicate balancing act between its European aspirations, partnership with NATO and its centuries-old religious, ethnic and political alliance with Russia. But as tensions between Russia and the European Union over Ukraine are rising, Serbia is under pressure to harmonise its foreign policy with that of the EU, which it aims to join, and introduce sanctions against Moscow, among other things. ""They (Russia) were the only country not to have imposed sanctions against us in the 1990s,"" Vucic said after a National Security Council meeting. ""They also supported our territorial integrity in the United Nations. We must not forget that,"" Vucic said, referring to Russia's stance on Serbia's former province of Kosovo whose independence Moscow refuses to recognise. However, Vucic said the National Security Council concluded the Republic of Serbia considers ""very wrong the violation of territorial integrity of a number of countries including Ukraine."" Serbia has put its gas and oil sectors in Russia's hands. In 2008 the Balkan country sold a majority stake of its oil company to Gazprom Neft. Gazprom is the majority stakeholder in the country's sole gas storage facility. In return, Russia has been blocking membership of Serbia's former province Kosovo in the United Nations. Serbia lost control of Kosovo after a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 to halt killing of ethnic Albanians by Serb forces during a two-year counterinsurgency. Vucic said the National Security Council decided that Serbia will stop all military drills with foreign troops to preserve military neutrality. He said Serbia will take legal action against its citizens who fight abroad.

2/26/2022,"A real-estate agent's Facebook video shows swarms of people arriving to look at a $260,000 home. ""People are so desperate for a home under a particular price point,"" the agent said. A wave of newly arriving buyers is driving prices out of reach for local incomes, she added. To get a vivid picture of the housing-inventory situation facing many parts of the US, look no further than a recent Facebook post from a real-estate agent in Raleigh, North Carolina. Shortly after 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Monique Edwards was wrapping up a showing with a client at 4509 Lafferty Court when she paused to make a video showing the lines of cars and people arriving to look at the newly listed home. ""Someone stopped me, and they wanted to know what was going on in the neighborhood, and I just told them the truth. I said, 'We're having a housing crisis,'"" Edwards says in the video. While the property itself was reasonably attractive, Edwards said the frenzy was a response to the comparably affordable price in an area where the median home value recently hit $400,000. That's a bit higher than the national median price, which ticked up to a record high of $365,000 in January — a rising price increasingly out of reach for the average US worker. ""This is a home that is priced under $300,000 here in the Raleigh area, and as you can see, there are just cars upon cars upon cars — and there are a ton of people that are trying to see this home,"" she says in the video. ""People are so desperate for a home under a particular price point because people don't make as much money,"" she adds. The Facebook video captured more than 6,400 reactions, 7,000 comments, and 16,000 shares and went viral on other platforms, like Reddit, but Edwards told Insider the scene was ""more common than you think."" ""It's an open secret. I just decided to tell it,"" she said. The immediate neighborhood surrounding the Lafferty Court house is fairly working class, Edwards said, but a wave of newly arriving buyers is driving prices out of reach for local incomes. Meanwhile, homes at higher price points tend to have less competition. Less than 24 hours after posting her video, Edwards told Insider she received a notification that the listing was under contract, which concluded a stark lesson for her client about the challenges of buying a home in 2022.

2/26/2022,"By Polina Devitt, Gleb Stolyarov and Natalia Zinets MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine's military has suspended commercial shipping at its ports after Russian forces invaded the country, an adviser to the Ukrainian president's chief of staff said, stoking fear of supply disruption from leading grain and oilseeds exporters. Russia earlier ordered the Azov Sea closed to the movement of commercial vessels until further notice, but kept Russian ports in the Black Sea open for navigation, its officials and five grain industry sources said on Thursday. Global farm commodities trader Cargill Inc said an ocean vessel it chartered was ""hit by a projectile"" on the Black Sea, but that the ship remained seaworthy and all crew were safe . Ukraine is a major exporter of corn (maize), much of it destined for China and the European Union. It also competes with Russia to supply wheat to major buyers such as Egypt and Turkey. Industry estimates currently put Ukraine's grain exports at about 5 million to 6 million tonnes a month, comprising about 4.5 million tonnes are corn, 1 million tonnes of wheat and a remaining share of mainly barley. Main grain export ports include Chornomorsk, Mikolayiv, Odessa, Kherson and Yuzhny. Egypt's state grains buyer cancelled an international purchasing tender for wheat on Thursday amid reports that no offers of either Russian or Ukrainian wheat had been received. Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday in a massed assault by land, sea and air, the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. ""The market is still struggling to get a clear picture of the actual military situation on the ground. The ports in the Azov and Black Sea so far seem not to have been damaged according to the initial shipping agency reports,"" one European grain trader said. The trader said the market was looking out for any declarations of force majeure, meaning suppliers will not fulfil contractual obligations because of extreme circumstances. Shipping group Maersk said on Thursday it had halted all port calls in Ukraine until the end of February and has shut its main office in Odessa on the Black Sea coast because of the conflict. Global agricultural commodities trader Bunge Ltd said Thursday it had shuttered company offices in Ukraine and operations in its Black Sea grains port in Nikolaev, Ukraine, had been suspended. Competitor Archer-Daniels Midland Co said its Ukraine facilities, including an Odessa export terminal, were not operating. [L1N2UZ3OP] Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, mainly ships its grain from ports in the Black Sea. The Azov Sea's ports are shallower and have less capacity. Mariupol, reported to be under attack from Russian forces, one of the biggest Ukrainian ports in the Azov Sea, mainly handles relatively small ships of between 3,000 to 10,000 tonnes deadweight. The Azov Sea ports export wheat, barley and corn to Mediterranean importers including Cyprus, Egypt, Italy, Lebanon and Turkey. Another European trader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such countries would have to seek alternative supplies if the ships were unable to depart in the near future. U.S. wheat futures rose to the highest level in nearly a decade as the conflict threatened to disrupt the flow of supplies from the region while European wheat futures climbed to a record peak. [GRA/] Russia and Ukraine account for 29% of global wheat exports, 19% of world maize (corn) exports, and 80% of world sunflower oil exports. Russia produced 76 million tonnes of wheat last year and is expected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to export 35 million tonnes in the July-June season, 17% of the global total. Russia supplies wheat to all the major global buyers. Turkey and Egypt are the largest importers. Ukraine asked Turkey on Thursday to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships, the Ukrainian ambassador to Ankara said. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he backed Ukraine's territorial integrity but there was no immediate response to Kyiv's request. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Ankara has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships in wartime or if threatened.
