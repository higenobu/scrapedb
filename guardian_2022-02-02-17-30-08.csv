The 32-year-old was pictured training with Barcelona after being released by Arsenal and signing a contract at Camp Nou.  Aubameyang wrote on Instagram: “To the Arsenal fans, Thank you for making London home for myself and my family for the past four years. We went through ups and downs together and your support meant everything to me. “Having the chance to win trophies and the honour of being the captain of this club is something I will forever keep in my heart. I have always been 100 per cent focused and committed on doing everything I can for this club which is why leaving without a real goodbye hurts – but that is football. “I’m sad I did not get the chance to help my teammates in the last few weeks, but I have nothing but respect for this club and truly wish all my guys and the fans all the best and many successful years in the future!” Aubameyang last played for Arsenal in early December after being stripped of the captaincy for disciplinary reasons.

2/2/2022,"Australians have been talking about foodstuffs this week after the prime minister was unable to nominate the price of a loaf of bread when quizzed during his National Press Club appearance. A Sky News journalist on Tuesday asked Scott Morrison if he had “lost touch with ordinary Australians”. Could the PM, for instance, name the price of “a loaf of bread, a litre of petrol and a rapid antigen test?” Morrison stated that he “wasn’t going to pretend to you that I go out each day and I buy a loaf of bread and I buy a litre of milk”.  To make matters worse, the prime minister’s frontbench colleague Stuart Robert came to his defence on Wednesday, suggesting on the ABC that if Morrison’s wife, Jen, was with him she’d be able to “rattle off all the prices of all the things they buy”. Morrison is not the first politician to fall at this incredibly low hurdle. In fact, it seems every time a politician talks about, or even worse enters, a supermarket, disaster ensues. Here are some of the strangest and most embarrassing retail-based political blunders. Of course, we must begin with the infamous incident when a bloke called then prime minister Tony Abbott a “dickhead” in a hardware store. On the other side of the aisle (literally) former Labor leader Bill Shorten may not have been quizzed on the price of lettuce, but he did manage to produce some of the most excruciatingly awkward small talk in human history in the salad section at Woolworths. There was also that time in 2012 when now deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce suggested Labor’s carbon tax would hike up the price of a Sunday roast to $100. Despite his efforts to justify this wild prediction to the media in the following days the statement was still roundly derided as ridiculous. Back in the days before Brexit, the British prime minister David Cameron was cornered in a radio interview, unable to name the price of a cheap loaf of bread. “I don’t buy the value sliced loaf, I’ve got a breadmaker at home … but you can buy a loaf in the supermarket for well north of a pound.” The price was not “well north of a pound” for the record, at the time it was 47p. To make matters worse he then recommended people buy a £100 breadmaker instead, and use Cotswold Crunch flour which cost £30.20 for a 16kg bag. Now, you might think there is no way to make yourself seem posher than that, but the then London mayor – now UK prime minister – Boris Johnson found a way the very next day. When asked the same bread-based question by a reporter, Johnson initially got it right, suggesting 40-50p, but managed to undo all that good work by sarcastically stating that he has “no idea” how much value bread costs but could “tell you the price of a bottle of champagne” instead. Unfortunately, the country didn’t seem to find the joke as funny as he did. Back home and back in time, there was of course the infamous birthday cake debacle between Labor prime minister Paul Keating and opposition leader John Hewson. The year was 1993 and Hewson was basing his election campaign on this wild new concept of a “goods and services tax”, or GST. But he faced a wave of public humiliation after an infamous interview on A Current Affair, where he was unable to explain if a birthday cake (candles and all) would cost more or less under his new taxation system. Keating had a field day with this, staging a media opportunity in Brisbane whereby he entered a pharmacy and asked which items would be subject to GST. The pharmacist didn’t know, the media lapped it up, it was a great success. But alas there was food-based humiliation to come for Keating as well. He attempted the stunt a second time, this time walking into a Nowra bakery suggested by Labor’s local candidate for Gilmore, Peter Knott. But instead of happily chatting about how bloody confusing the idea of GST was, the bakery owner grilled Keating for minutes on end about the payroll tax in front of a crowd of eager journalists. The payroll tax was actually a state tax, but the damage was done. Legend has it that Keating referred to Knott from that time on only as “the cunt from the pie shop”. It truly is a wonder that media minders still let politicians within a kilometre of a supermarket.",News/Australia news,What’s the price of a loaf of bread?

2/2/2022,"The Florida teenager demanding Elon Musk hand over $50,000 to stop him tweeting the location of the billionaire’s private jet has said he is creating dozens more accounts tracking the movements of other rich and famous people. Jack Sweeney, a 19-year-old college student and aviation enthusiast, said he had created 16 automated Twitter accounts, or bots, similar to @ElonJet to follow jets owned by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates (@GatesJet), Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban and the rapper Drake.  Landed near Harlingen, Texas, US. Apx. flt. time 25 Mins. pic.twitter.com/DLNGCTxftm In an interview with the Guardian, Sweeney said he had also created a website, Ground Control, to “monetise” the service by offering bespoke tracking services to celebrities’ superfans and to host web versions of the Twitter bots if the microblogging site closes his accounts because of privacy concerns raised by the subjects. “They’re either really prominent people or just like really interesting,” Sweeney said of the people he tracks. “Lately I have been adding people that [his followers] have requested.” Recent accounts he has set up after requests include Cuban and Drake, who he said was the most interesting. “He has the biggest plane out of all of them, it is a giant Boeing.” The rapper’s plane, Air Drake, is a $185m 59ft-long Boeing 767-200ER that can carry 216 passengers. Sweeney, who created @ElonJet in June 2020, said he hoped Musk would reopen negotiations to buy and close down the account. The co-founder and chief executive of Tesla has refused the teenager’s demand for $50,000. Musk, the world’s richest person with an estimated $220bn fortune, has urged Sweeney to delete the account. “Can you take this down? It is a security risk,” Musk, wrote in a direct message to the teenager. “I don’t love the idea of being shot by a nutcase.” N887WM Landed in Seattle, Washington, US.

It would be great support in college and would possibly allow me to get a car, maybe even a [Tesla] Model 3.” Musk later said he did not feel comfortable paying anything. Sweeney replied that if Musk did not want to pay, he would delete the account in return for an internship at Tesla. “That was the last thing I said [to Musk],” Sweeney said. “And then he blocked me.”",News/Technology,"Teen monitoring Elon Musk’s jet ‘tracking Gates, Bezos and Drake too’",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/02/teen-tracking-elon-musk-jet-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-drake-jack-sweeney-tesla-flight-tracker-bot
2/2/2022,"Almost one in 10 households are now experiencing “fuel stress” amid surging gas and electricity prices – a figure expected to treble overnight after the new energy price cap comes in on 1 April. The Resolution Foundation forecasts that energy bills will become unaffordable for 27% of households when the price cap rises to about £2,000 a year. The poorest households may have to spend half their income on energy.  Six people speak about how rising fuel costs are affecting them. Thirty-nine-year-old Sarah Moorby in Kirkby, Lonsdale has been “absolutely terrified” about providing a meter reading to her new energy supply company since being switched over from People Energy, which went bust in September. “I was paying £105.78 a month before but my duel fuel bill for electric and gas which covered October to mid-January with British Gas was £627.” Moorby, who works as a welfare assistant and has three children aged 15, 18 and 19, has applied for a warm home discount after she started receiving universal credit in March 2021. She said if her energy bills remain at the same rate for the rest of the year she is looking at an increase of about £2,500 for the year but is still waiting to hear if the discount will be applied to her bill. “I’ve got used to shaving off money here and there to make the pennies go further, but an extra £115 a month is going to have to come out of my food bill, or clothing for the kids,” she said. “Everything’s so expensive now – even if it’s just 10p or 20p more. I used to spend around £60 a week on food but now it’s more like £75 still buying the same items. I’ve already lost two stone because I struggle to feed myself and choose to feed the kids. I just don’t think I’m going to be able to afford it. The fear I have is if I don’t pay it or can’t pay it they’ll put me on a prepayment meter which will cost me more and some days I just won’t have the money to be able to put the electricity on.” Pensioner Steven Tuszynski says he was “absolutely shocked” to learn that his energy provider was doubling his bills from next month. “Why is no one up in arms about this?” the 72-year-old asks. Tuszynski, who lives in Flintshire, north Wales, is on a fixed dual fuel contract with Octopus, and will see his monthly bills rise from £120 to £238 from mid-February. Tuszynski looked at several price comparison sites, but has decided to stay with his current provider, as he worries about smaller companies going bust. The jump in costs means Tuszynski and his wife, who live in a house dating back to 1745, will look at cutting back on how many months they heat their home for. “We live in an old stone house – it takes a lot to heat it. Normally, come the end of April we switch off the central heating for good. It’ll probably go off earlier this year, in mid-March,” he says, adding that energy costs aren’t “the only thing that’s going up”, as he’s noticed a spike in food prices and is expecting council bills to rise too. The 72-year-old, who has lived in his home for 25 years, says: “I can’t see how we can go on, unless we sell and move – only we love our house so much, and we don’t really want to.” In North Essex, retiree Lyn said it was “disturbing” to find the £140 warm home discount she receives on her bill has effectively been cancelled out because of the rise in energy costs. “I’ve never had the discount before but because of the media and the possibility of increased bills I thought I’d apply for it [last year] along with pension credit,” said the 69-year-old. Lyn was moved to EDF Energy on a dual fuel tariff expiring in 2024 after Green Network Energy ceased trading in January 2021. Her monthly direct debit has increased from £66 to £79. She said she asked for it to be reduced but was refused. “It seems a little inflexible given the situation we’re all in,” she said. “My house is well insulated and only partially heated in three rooms to 15C max for part of the day. My income is low as my private pension collapsed and was replaced by the Financial Assistance Service, so I’ll have to pull back on food costs. “I don’t know what the government can do to help our energy bills, but it’s not totally down to energy as inflation generally is becoming evident.” Andrew Davies, a self-employed gardener in his 50s, hasn’t been billed for gas since 27 September, when his gas provider collapsed. He was moved over to Shell Energy but an account has not yet been set up in his name, meaning his bill is building up. Davies, who lives in Llandrindod Wells, mid Wales, paid his final bill from his old provider in October and says his customer account “fell into a black hole” when Shell Energy took over. “They have not yet set me up with an account. I have contacted customer service many times by email and or phone,” he says, explaining that customer service is unable to find his meter point reference number in their system. “They can’t help me as they have not created an account for me … I can’t get anywhere.” He says that while he is able to budget, he worries that some people may struggle. As he lives in a small property, he doesn’t think his bill will have grown too large, but acknowledges that there could be “other people with [unpaid bills of] £500 or £600 or even more that is just sat there getting bigger.” He adds: “I know mine’s not unmanageable, but I can’t speak for other people.” “In November we managed to negotiate our electricity bill down from £276 to £150 a month,” said Chris in Devon, who is on a variable rate with Octopus. She and her partner used to pay £68 a month but were asked to increase their direct debit in October because they weren’t covering the cost. They now owe Octopus about £1,400 but have decided to stick to the new monthly payments for the foreseeable future. “We are absolutely shocked at how much energy has gone up and has left us with debt,” said the 25-year-old NHS worker. “My partner’s job is seasonal and my income is mostly based around universal credit because I have a toddler and only work part-time. “The increase has been difficult for our finances and we budget more tightly with food but thankfully we have family to support us. It’s not just energy though: everything is going up. We shop at a local Lidl and we’ve noticed the price changes there. With everything costing so much there must be thousands of people who could be thrown into poverty.” In Northampton, pensioner Will has seen around a 50 per cent increase in his electricity usage since his landlord moved supplier recently after the previous one went into bankruptcy. “It used to cost approximately £5 a week but it’s now gone up to around £10 depending on how cold it is,” said the 72-year-old. Will, who has been living in shared accommodation for three years, uses a prepayment meter which he “pops coins into” when he needs to. “I probably use the electricity the most in the household. I had major heart surgery last June and the cold really affects me, and because I’ve not been well I’m virtually at home all day.” His income is about £1,300 a month, which includes his state pension and financial assistance he receives for housing and council tax. He believes he would be eligible for a warm home discount but because his landlord receives the electricity bill he doesn’t think he can apply for it. “It’s been tough. I’m having difficulty walking so at least I’ve been able to reduce my expenditure by not going out, but I’ve also been eating less. If the electricity price goes up again it will become quite a concern. We’ll just have to wait and see.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘Why is no one up in arms?’ Six householders on the menace of fuel poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/02/why-is-no-one-up-in-arms-six-householders-on-the-menace-of-fuel-poverty
2/2/2022,"To adapt Ronald Reagan’s adage, the nine most terrifying words in the English language are “I’m from the government, and I’ll set you free.” Every time this government says freedom, it means freedom for someone other than you. Seeking to distract us from his own pursuit of freedom during lockdown, this week Boris Johnson announced what he calls a Brexit freedoms bill. Its purpose is to accelerate the removal of EU rules from our legislation, and to “cut £1 billion of red tape for UK businesses”.  This announcement happened to fall on the first day of the final stage of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower catastrophe, which will investigate the role of government. It will explore the long history of “cutting red tape” that likely led to this disaster. A timeline published by Inside Housing shows how the process began with Margaret Thatcher’s 1984 Building Act, which deregulated the industry and part-privatised building control. It continued with the decision by Tony Blair’s government to ignore the recommendations of a parliamentary committee, that all cladding should be “entirely non-combustible”. Later, in 2005, Blair’s government transferred responsibility for assessing fire risk from the fire service to building owners, a classic exercise in self-regulation. In the same year, it relaxed restrictions on the use of combustible insulation on tall buildings. In 2011, David Cameron announced a programme to “cut red tape”. His government later boasted that, under this scheme, “businesses with good records have had fire safety inspections reduced from 6 hours to 45 minutes”. In 2012, his minister Eric Pickles repealed crucial fire safety measures in the London Building Act (1939). In the same year, Cameron announced that he would “kill off the health and safety culture for good”. No new regulation, he decreed, could be introduced unless two were removed. In 2014, the housing minister Brandon Lewis used this rule to justify rejecting the call by MPs to make sprinklers mandatory in tall buildings. In 2016, Cameron’s rule was ramped up: three regulations would have to be removed for every one introduced. The Conservative MP leading a government review into “cutting red tape”, Oliver Letwin, toyed with the idea of scrapping building regulations altogether. On the morning of 14 June 2017, a panel working for Letwin’s review met to consider whether EU rules on the fire resistance of cladding materials should be dismantled. A document produced for the review described these rules as “red tape folly”. As the panel discussed the issue, Grenfell Tower burned, and 72 people were killed. When politicians like Johnson, Cameron and Blair inveigh against “red tape”, as often as not they mean the public protections that permit a safe and decent life. These include the rules that prevent workers from being exploited and elderly people from being scammed. They include the rules that stop food manufacturers loading their products with sugar and fat, and prevent tower blocks from being incinerated. They include the rules that stop our rivers being turned into sewers and the air from poisoning our lungs. Freedom for the builder is jeopardy for the residents. Freedom for the boss is exploitation for the worker. Freedom for the driver is death to the pedestrian. Freedom for the food business is sickness for the consumer. Freedom for the water company is rivers full of sewage. Freedom for the oil company is an uninhabitable planet. Interestingly, the government press release announcing Johnson’s Brexit freedoms bill also celebrated “ending free movement”. Clearly, Brexit’s freedoms are not universal. In fact, the bill appears designed to circumvent democratic freedoms, using Henry VIII powers to cut regulations without parliamentary scrutiny. It also seems to have terminated some of the democratic freedoms of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as their governments were not consulted. But this bill is the point of Brexit. The multimillionaires who funded the campaign to leave the European Union sought freedom from the decencies they owe to other people, freedom from the restraint that defines civic life. Our country has been torn apart in the civil war within capitalism: between the businesses seeking stability and predictability, and the asset-strippers and oligarchs who want to rip everything down and then sift the rubble for gold. While the Conservatives attack public protections, genuine red tape – that is, pointless form-filling and officialdom – has boomed. A central feature of the neoliberal revolution that brought Boris Johnson to power is a proliferation of corporate and governmental bureaucracy: new barriers to obtaining public services, an impenetrable thicket of train franchises and test-and-trace companies, the life-consuming nightmare afflicting people stuck in unsellable flats clad in flammable materials, the paperwork in which importers and exporters are now drowning, the endless queues at Dover. As a paper in the journal Safety Science shows, deregulation causes chaos, and chaos causes bureaucratic overload. Far from liberating the nation from red tape, government assaults on public protection tie us up in knots. It is not we who are being set free. It is a particular class of capitalists, who fund the Conservative party and protect the politicians who deliver for them, regardless of public disgust. I’m talking about the property developers, money launderers, suppliers of dodgy PPE, newspaper proprietors and the other wealthy ghouls who have formed a square around the prime minister.

2/2/2022,"There is no doubt about the most unusual clause of this transfer window. Internazionale signed Robin Gosens on loan from Atalanta with an obligation to buy him for €25m (£20.8m) when they score their first goal of 2023. But perhaps the most interesting theme of the month was what it showed about clubs who have a clear strategy and those who do not. This was a typical January window, with slow weeks followed by a crazy final few days, but whereas some clubs moved late and had real moments of panic, others had an obvious plan. Aston Villa did good business relatively early by bringing in Philippe Coutinho and Lucas Digne, and Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City are also examples of clubs with a policy.  Chelsea decided not to make a panic buy at left-back even though Ben Chilwell is out for the season. They wanted Emerson Palmieri back but there is no recall clause in his loan with Lyon so they decided to continue with the current squad rather than sign a player they only want for six months and maybe create a problem. City taking Julián Álvarez from River Plate for £14m was a smart strategy with an eye on the future and United were also looking ahead. They did not include buy options when they loaned out Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek and Amad Diallo because they want whoever the manager is next summer to decide whether they want to keep those players. Similarly, United did not buy a midfielder even though they were offered opportunities such as Denis Zakaria, who went to Juventus from Borussia Mönchengladbach, and Marseille’s Boubacar Kamara. They preferred to carry on with this squad and keep the funds for the manager in the summer. The club turned down a lot of money from Newcastle for Jesse Lingard on deadline day, too. Newcastle were prepared to pay a big sum after missing out on Hugo Ekitike, and Lingard told Ralf Rangnick again at lunchtime on Monday that he wanted to leave, but the situation with Mason Greenwood meant United decided to keep him – even though the 29-year-old will go as a free agent in the summer. Newcastle then tried to sign Dele Alli in the final hours, after a deal was agreed between Everton and Tottenham and the player had started his medical. The answer from Alli’s side was clear, though: he was not going to change his mind. A big reason was that he had been waiting for a move all month and there had been no real interest from Newcastle, whereas Frank Lampard quickly showed he wanted him when he got the Everton job. Lampard was a big reason why Van de Beek went to Everton. If Vítor Pereira had been appointed the Dutch midfielder would have joined Crystal Palace. An agreement was in place and there had been a positive conversation with Palace’s manager, Patrick Vieira, but Lampard made Van de Beek a priority and was calling him all the time during negotiations. Money also played a part, with Everton paying a loan fee and 100% of the wages, whereas Palace were able to pay 85% of the wages and no loan fee. Deals falling through are part of transfer business but it was unusual to see Bruno Guimarães’s Newcastle move almost collapse three times. First, Lyon changed the price from €40m to €50m and Newcastle were furious. Then there was a disagreement over the payment of agent commissions. And finally there were big complications over the medical because the player had to fly from Ecuador to Belo Horizonte. The signing is a real achievement for Newcastle because Arsenal and Juventus had started talks to buy Guimarães this summer. But maybe the most incredible signing belongs to Liverpool with Luis Díaz. Tottenham were really close to buying him – they made a €35m bid and a representative from Spurs was flying to Portugal to negotiate with Porto. But when Liverpool heard, they jumped in. Jürgen Klopp had Díaz as a top priority for the summer and didn’t want to miss out. They put an offer of €40m plus €20m in add-ons on the table and sealed the negotiations unbelievably quickly. Within 24 hours everything was done, including sending people to South America for the medical, and Spurs were furious. Liverpool couldn’t quite get a deal done for Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho on deadline night but they will be back soon to find a solution because he is another one Klopp really wants. Liverpool have a plan – and they usually execute it.",Sport/Football,January window displayed which Premier League clubs have a plan | Fabrizio Romano,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/january-transfer-window-displayed-which-premier-league-clubs-have-plan
2/2/2022,"“As a Blackburn fan I put more stock in 19th century trophies than perhaps I should,” writes Simon Elliott. “However, are Rovers unique in winning major trophies in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries? Are there any equivalents from other countries? For the purposes of this, the 2002 League Cup is a major trophy.” “Though organised football was more or less restricted to these islands in the 19th century there are a number of other clubs who can match or better Blackburn’s achievement,” begins Sean DeLoughry. “Celtic, Rangers, Linfield and Glentoran have won every major domestic competition available to them each century. Additionally, Hibernian, Hearts, Bangor, Distillery and Cliftonville have racked up major honours in each century. Here’s an overview:  England: Blackburn (19th Century Cup, 20th Century League/Cup, 21st Century LC)Scotland: Celtic (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC), Hearts (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C Cup), Hibernian (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C Cup/LC), Rangers (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC)Wales: Bangor (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C League/Cup)Northern Ireland Cliftonville (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C League/LC), Distillery (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C LC), Glentoran (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC), Linfield (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC) “Other English clubs who could match Blackburn during the 21st century are Aston Villa, Everton, Wolves, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Preston and Sunderland (plus Bury if you count 1900 as the last year of the 19th century).” Jason Sarfo-Annin picked out the same examples from the British Isles but also looked at some potential three-century major trophy-winners from other nations. “Argentina and Italy established their leagues in the 19th century but the usual suspects didn’t win their first titles till the 20th century,” he writes. “Genoa can still become the only Italian club to have titles across three centuries if they win something in the 21st century. If you consider winning other leagues in the professional football pyramid as major honours then RFC Liège in Belgium fit the bill having won the top flight in the 19th and 20th centuries and the fourth tier in the 21st century. “In Switzerland Grasshoppers are a fun case. They won the top Swiss league in the 1897-98 season but it isn’t considered an official season as the league was not run by the Swiss FA that year. They also won the league in the 1899-1900 season. So if you agree with the view that a new century starts in 1901 and 2001 rather than 1900 and 2000 – then they just meet the criteria. They’ve won the top Swiss league across all three centuries. Peñarol in Uruguay are in the same boat as Grasshoppers with a league title in 1900.” Another team triumphing in 1900 were AIK, notes David Ekstrand: “This means that when they won their first Swedish championship on 29 July 29 of that year, it was still the 19th century. AIK then won nine Swedish titles in the 20th century and have so far won two in the 21st, the latest being in 2018.” “Has there even been, in a UK match, another pair of opposing captains whose surnames start with Z,” posed this commenter. “Katie Zelem (Manchester United) and Shelina Zadorsky (Tottenham) faced each other.” “I get that we’re specifying the UK to avoid listing hundreds of matches in countries where ‘Z’ players are commonplace,” mails Chris Page, “but can we make an exception for something as big as a World Cup semi-final? Back in 1982, a victorious Italian team captained by Dino Zoff defeated Wladyslaw Zmuda’s Poland. Similarly, the Euro 2004 quarter-final between France and Greece saw the teams captained by Zinedine Zidane and Theodoros Zagorakis. I did wonder if Zidane had ever captained a French team that went up against a Slovenian team captained by Zlatko Zlahovic, for a pair of ‘ZZ’ captains, but although they did line up against each other a couple of times, they didn’t do so with the armbands on.” “Which player has played for the most Uniteds?” tweets Ryan Murphy. Chris Page – again – has an answer we can all unite around. “With this sort of question, John Burridge never lets you down. Here were go: Southend, Sheffield, Newcastle … oh, that’s all. Of the 30-odd clubs he played for, only three I can see were ‘United’. There are plenty of well-known players who can match that, such as Rio Ferdinand (West Ham, Leeds, Manchester), Alan Smith (Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle) and Teddy Sheringham (Manchester, West Ham, Colchester).” There’s also Freddie Sears (West Ham, Scunthorpe, Colchester). “Scott Wootton can bring us up to four (Manchester, Peterborough, Leeds, Rotherham). And although we’re dipping into the non-league scene here, how about former Dominican international Jefferson Louis, who has had spells at Thame, Aylesbury, Oxford, Maidenhead, Hayes & Yeading, Banbury and Chesham, totalling seven.” Andy Brook also throws Imre Varadi into the mix with an impressive six (Sheffield, Newcastle, Leeds, Oxford, Rotherham and Scunthorpe). It would have been seven but after joining Boston, he was cut loose without playing a game. “In the 1985-86 Screensport Super Cup, Liverpool played the first leg of the semi-final against Norwich City on 5 February (1-1) but the second leg did not take place until 6 May (3-1 to Liverpool). Is this the longest gap between two legs of a tournament,” asked John Martin in September 2012. Michael Haughey pointed us in the direction of the 1955-58 Fairs Cup. It began on Christmas Day 1955 and ended on 1 May 1958 and the group stage was initially split into four groups of three teams, with each team to play the others twice. However, the withdrawal of the Cologne XI from Group C left Leipzig and Lausanne Sports to battle it out over what was essentially two legs. The German side won 6-3 in Leipzig on 6 March 1956 but Lausanne mounted a stunning fight-back nearly eight months later, winning 7-3 on home soil on 21 October 1956 to progress to the semi-finals (the first leg of which did not take place until 16 September 1957). “The query brings to mind the Anglo-Scottish Cup,” wrote Darren Hudson. “I recall the competition was revived in 1987 in which the FA Cup and Scottish Cup holders would meet over two legs. This pitted Coventry and St Mirren together in their version of a ‘Battle of Britain’, with the first leg taking place on 23 December 1987 at Highfield Road and ending 1-1. “The first leg was poorly attended and two sides couldn’t agree on a return date. As a result 23 December 2012 will mark 25 years since the playing of the first leg with the outcome still to be decided.” “Are Cameron Brannagan’s four penalties (out of four) for Oxford at Gillingham a domestic – or world record – during a 90-minute game?” asks David Weston. Leyton Orient have one more point than Hartlepool in League Two but a goal difference that’s superior to the tune of 25 goals. But what’s the largest ever gap in terms of goal difference that has decided the positions of teams locked on the same points at the end of a season? “Frank Lampard is the seventh Everton manager that Duncan Ferguson will be a member of the coaching staff for,” notes Brendan O’Mahony. “Is this a record for one continuous spell at a club?” Has any player made their debut in each of the top 5 divisions in a shorter period (1498 days) than Dan Burn?League Two12 December 2009Conference03 January 2011League One29 September 2012Championship 03 August 2013Premier League 18 January 2014  Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",Sport/Football,Which football clubs have won major trophies across three centuries? | The Knowledge,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/which-football-clubs-have-won-major-trophies-across-three-centuries
2/2/2022,"In the mid-70s, when I was a young reporter on the London newspaper the Evening News, I was sent to Peterborough – then pretty much on the edge of the paper’s circulation area – to do a story. I had finished my interview, and had an hour to wait until the next train back to London, so, having nothing to do, I went to look at Peterborough Cathedral. As you approach it from the west, there are three huge arches: they look like doorways for giants. Inside, I looked around and was completely fascinated. Most people who look at a cathedral feel this, usually asking themselves two questions: why did medieval people want one of these? And how did they build it?  The people of the 12th century were very poor, yet they created these wonderful buildings: very beautiful, very expensive, very difficult to build for people who had crude tools and lacked the mathematics to calculate stresses. When you look up at the big stones, particularly if there is a tower, you think: how did they get that all the way up there? Then there is the sheer beauty of these wonderful churches, the way the arches sweep up, and the perspective down the nave. The view from a distance is often enrapturing, too. It was the first time that I had really looked at a church like that. I was brought up in the Plymouth Brethren, a puritanical religious sect. Our churches were never called “churches”; they were halls with plain white walls. Pictures and statues were forbidden; the only bit of decoration might be an embroidered text. So for me, it was all new, and standing there in Peterborough Cathedral was the beginning of my fascination. Before long, I would seek out other cathedrals. If I was travelling somewhere that had a cathedral, I would give myself extra time to visit it, sometimes a couple of days. Now, I go armed with all the textbooks so I know the curiosities to look for; a lot of the interesting things in cathedrals are where something has gone wrong, and you see a little bodge that the builders had to make. A visit to my German publisher in Cologne is never without a visit to that city’s cathedral, which I’m sorry to say we nearly destroyed in the war. I have climbed into the dusty spaces under the roofs of many cathedrals, including Canterbury and Florence, and stood on the mighty beams that spanned the naves. Several decades later, I am still discovering new things. About five years ago, as part of a fundraising drive to raise money for repairs to Peterborough Cathedral, I was invited up on to the roof. It has pinnacles, little towers about 3ft high, and some of them had been replaced in the 50s with rather crude, plain versions. When you were on the roof, they looked awful, but from the ground, you couldn’t tell. People in the 50s had thought: you can’t see it from the ground, nobody will notice, so why spend the money? But what they thought in the middle ages was: this pinnacle has got to be beautiful because God can see it. That first trip to Peterborough sparked an idea: a novel about building a cathedral. Looking back, I can see that I couldn’t have written it then. I wasn’t good enough to write the book that I had in mind – set around the building of a 12th-century cathedral, which would take decades, and the lives of the people who worked on it – and it was too ambitious for me. It was about 10 years later, in 1986, that I thought about it again. It took me more than three years, but I was able to write The Pillars of the Earth, which is still my most successful and popular book. Then, in 2019, I published a book about Notre Dame Cathedral – a building I got to know well over many visits to Paris, and has meant a lot to me – to raise money for its restoration after the devastating fire that year. So, decades after The Pillars of the Earth was published, I am still writing about cathedrals. My lifelong passion for these places is more than just the architecture. When you go into a cathedral, you find yourself enveloped by a feeling of peace – it’s like a rest for your soul, especially in the busy 21st century. I walk into a cathedral and feel that I want to sit down and let that wash over me. That is one of the things that keeps me going back. I rebelled against my parents’ puritanical faith. I studied philosophy at university because I felt I needed help to make my mind up about religion and, within a year, I was an atheist and have been ever since. That also led me to spurn everything spiritual for a while. Cathedrals brought me back; I am still an atheist, but I do have a spiritual life. I feel grateful to Peterborough Cathedral for showing me something. I certainly never dreamed, in those days, that I would end up writing my best book about a cathedral. But, in a broader sense, I never dreamed that these wonderful buildings would become such an important part of my life. Ken Follett’s new novel, Never, is published by Macmillan in hardback at £20.
