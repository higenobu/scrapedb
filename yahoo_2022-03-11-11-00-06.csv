""Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom,"" SpaceX launch engineer Julia Black called out just before the 8:45 a.m. EST liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. ""Launch director is go for launch."" The rocket successfully launched 48 Starlink internet satellites to orbit, then returned to land on the Just Read the Instructions drone ship a few minutes later. It marked the booster's fourth flight to date. The broomstick comments came after Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russia's space corporation Roscosmos, continued to assault U.S. space operations and companies on social media and in interviews. ""In a situation like this we can't supply the United States with our world's best rocket engines. Let them fly on something else like their broomsticks, I don't know what,"" Rogozin said on Russian television last week.

Rogozin's latest comments built on similar statements he made in 2014. When the U.S. announced sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, Rogozin famously said NASA astronauts could launch to the ISS on trampolines since there was no American-made vehicle capable of doing the job; the space shuttle had retired three years earlier. But since 2020, SpaceX has launched four crewed missions to the International Space Station, leading founder Elon Musk to make comments like: ""The trampoline is working!"" The Space Coast's next launch, meanwhile, will see a team of four private passengers fly to the ISS in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. The liftoff from Kennedy Space Center's pad 39A is targeted for 2:36 p.m. EST Wednesday, March 30. For the latest, visit floridatoday.com/launchschedule.

3/11/2022,"Stepping off an aircraft carrier two generations younger than the one he served on, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said the state of the nation’s carrier fleet is strong. As for the USS Gerald R. Ford, “she is absolutely ready to fight,” he said. “This wonderful crew has been eager to come out of the shipyard finally and deploy our Navy’s newest carrier.” The Ford has just finished six months of maintenance and modernization work at Newport News Shipbuilding and is about to begin training and preparations for deployment, initially working on certifying its flight deck and the sailors working there. That will be followed by a spell of integrating its air wing, and then by operating together with the cruiser and destroyers in its strike group to refine combined operations of the entire strike group. Del Toro said the Ford is on track to deploy in the next few months. A 22½ year veteran of the Navy, whose service included working as the assistant engineer for the carrier USS America’s main propulsion system, Del Toro said the Navy remains committed to an 11- or 12-carrier fleet. “Whenever there’s a crisis anywhere in the world, the first question the President asks, that I myself and the Secretary of Defense ask is ‘where is the nearest carrier?’,” he said. He said the Norfolk-based USS Harry S. Truman’s current role in the Mediterranean, where its air wing has been conducting air policing missions over NATO’s eastern flank, shows the importance of carriers. Del Toro shrugged off suggestions that have emerged in recent years that the Navy should replace some of its large nuclear carriers with smaller ones, saying the national already had light carriers in the form of its amphibious assault ships. Those are warships, like Norfolk-based USS Kearsarge, USS Bataan and USS Iwo Jima that can handle F-35B fighters, AV-8B Harrier II attack aircraft and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft as well as a range of helicopters. But he said the Navy needs to retire some of its aging cruisers. That would free up funds for the Navy’s planned new frigate as well as the latest version of its Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, he said. Asked about a court order that the Pentagon says has sidelined a Norfolk destroyed because the order bars reassignment of a Norfolk commander who has declined to be vaccinated, Del Toto said he is confident the courts will resolve the issue fairly while taking national security needs into consideration. “We deeply care about good order and discipline in the Navy,” he said. “Fortunately, we also living in a country where we have rights.” Dave Ress, 757-247-4535, dress@dailypress.com",U.S./Daily Press,"USS Gerald R.
