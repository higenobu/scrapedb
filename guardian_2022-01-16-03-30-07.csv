1/16/2022,"A minister has said Boris Johnson needs to “change his ways” as he recalled how, in the same month when some in No 10 were “not behaving appropriately”, he was not able to support his children before they died. Guy Opperman, the pensions minister and MP for Hexham, said Johnson should stay in his post, but was critical of the rule-breaking.  Johnson has continued to face criticism, including from those on his frontbench, after admitting to attending a “bring your own booze” garden party in No 10 on 20 May 2020, which he says he understood to be a “work event”. Opperman and his wife Flora’s newborn twin boys, Teddy and Rafe, died the following month. Speaking to BBC’s Politics North programme, the Tory MP said: “I feel pretty emotional about this because in May 2020 my wife and kids were unwell and they went to hospital. I was not able to go there to support them. And I’ve got constituents who couldn’t go to the care homes, to funerals, who were obviously obeying the rules, and quite clearly in No 10 at that time there were a number of people not behaving appropriately. I feel pretty emotional that I wasn’t able to support my wife and kids.” Another Tory MP, Ian Levy, said he had been unable to see his relative due to the restrictions. The Blyth Valley MP said in a statement online: “My own family was affected by this – unable to see my wife’s mother when she was dying in a nursing home. “I understand the real anger at reports that those in power were not abiding by the rules. The public deserves better than this.”",News/Politics,Minister whose newborn sons died in pandemic criticises No 10 parties,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/15/minister-whose-newborn-sons-died-in-pandemic-criticises-no-10-parties
1/16/2022,"A group of political activists will make one desperate last attempt this month to save the bitterly divided French left from an electoral catastrophe in the presidential election with a “people’s primary” to designate a single candidate. The Primaire Populaire was initiated by young people dismayed by the fractures that could mean no leftwing or socialist figure will reach the second round of the election in April.  So far, 300,000 people have joined the group that is calling for leftwing candidates to sign up to a “Common Ground” charter of 10 measures centred on the environment, social justice and democratic reforms. This is around 40% of all members of leftwing parties in France. More than a third have registered to take part in a popular vote to be held online between 27-30 January. Although widely dismissed as a futile exercise, the movement is gathering support. On Saturday, the influential socialist mayor of Marseille, Benoît Payan, said he would back whoever won the primary. The French left is fielding four main candidates: Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo for the Parti Socialiste (PS); Green party leader Yannick Jadot; the 70-year-old hard-left revolutionary Jean-Luc Mélenchon; and the former justice minister Christiane Taubira, who announced her decision to stand on Saturday and take part in the people’s primary. Polls show none stand a chance of reaching the second round in April. Calls for unity have been ignored, with analysts blaming candidates’ egos and “unrecognisable” policy stances. Mélenchon and Jadot have dismissed the people’s primary and said they would not take part. Hidalgo initially said she would, then rowed back, while Taubira said she would support the vote result and programme. Mathilde Imer, spokesperson for the Primaire Populaire, said: “This isn’t a classic primary election but a citizens’ nomination. We, the voters, will ourselves designate the person we think is the best placed to unite and win. It’s in the hands of the people. The vote will happen with or without the agreement of the candidates.” Samuel Grzybowski, another of the group’s representatives, added: “The candidates could have organised this among themselves, but now it’s up to us, the citizens, to choose.” To limit the possibility of voting fraud, those who have registered to vote must give credit card details and pay a symbolic €1. Émeric Bréhier, director of the Observatoire de la vie politique of the left-leaning Jean-Jaurès Foundation and lecturer at the Bordeaux Institute of Political Studies, does not hold out much hope for the people’s primary. “Even if 200,000 people sign up and vote for a candidate, it won’t speak to the wider voting population. And the idea that even if you don’t want to be a candidate in the vote you are one anyway seems a strange way of doing things.” Bréhier believes the 2022 election is lost to the left, and particularly the PS. Hidalgo, who unveiled her programme last week, is lagging well behind five other candidates at less than 4% of voting intentions, behind Jadot and Mélenchon. Polls indicate that, if united, the total leftwing vote could add up to 25% – not enough to outweigh that for rightwing candidates, but enough to make them count. “It’s too late for the party to make a mark on this election. Each candidate, on the left, is swimming in their own lane and none wants to budge an inch,” Bréhier told the Observer. “The Socialist party is in trouble and has been for several years. I can’t see at this stage how we can get out of that. “The most important question now is what happens after 2022. The left needs to establish a basic ideology which is something that has been nonexistent in the last few years. “Lots of socialist voters today say they’ll vote for [Emmanuel] Macron or Mélenchon or Taubira, but not Hidalgo. Socialist voters still exist and the passion for core principles, like equality, have not disappeared. But we have to have a strategy. There is no magic wand. It will be a long, slow and complicated reconstruction.” An electoral catastrophe would also come at a heavy financial cost for the PS: Hidalgo needs at least 5% of the vote in the first round for her campaign costs to be reimbursed by the taxpayer. In 2017, PS presidential candidate Benoît Hamon polled a historic low of just under 6.4%, leaving the party’s finances parlous and forcing the sale of its Paris headquarters. Macron came to power five years ago on a centrist programme designed to break France’s traditional two-party system. The opposition right, Les Républicains, have since resurrected their election hopes with Valérie Pécresse, while the PS remains in the stalls.",News/World news,France’s divided leftwing candidates called on to back ‘people’s primary’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/15/frances-divided-leftwing-candidates-called-on-to-back-peoples-primary
1/16/2022,"Aman in Maryland has been given a pig’s heart as a transplant (genetically modified, phew), and the old chestnut rolls out again: won’t that maybe somehow make him … piggy? The rationalists laugh, and the surgeons reassure: it’s just a muscle! A pump! Physically, they may be right (the heart is complex and still not fully understood), but culturally they couldn’t be more wrong. Over millennia and across the world, the heart has also been a house, a book, a rose, a pine cone, a pomegranate, a bunch of grapes, a pincushion, a wheel, a fountain, a picnic spot, a cup, a harp, a map. It flies, sinks, grows, breaks, rejoices, flutters, burns. It’s wounded with blades, sacrificed, given, stolen, swept, polished, eaten. Frida Kahlo painted it, as a pile of paint.  The heart is the only human organ other than the penis to move beyond our control, and we’ve never got over it. Imagine being stone-age: you feel it beat faster when you’re angry, scared or lustful, when you hunt; you know to shoot for the heart to kill. But you don’t know how it works. Dead, it’s just a flesh whoopie cushion. No wonder magic and religion settled in. Followed by love, courage, honesty and the rest. In Gilgamesh, the oldest written story, the hero’s heart beats with pride. In an Egyptian poem, at least 3,000 years old, a woman says: “My heart flutters hastily when I think of my love for you; it lets me not act sensibly, it leaps from its place.” Be still my beating heart … After death, the Egyptian heart was weighed against the Feather of Truth before a panel of deities: models of scarab beetles carried lengthy prayers beseeching the heart not to speak out against its owner. The true heart would go west across the Nile to spend eternity eating cake with Osiris; the impure heart was itself eaten, by Ammit, a chimaera of crocodile, hippo and lion. As Hank Williams wrote centuries later: “Your cheatin’ heart will tell on you.” Heart symbolism emerged naturally and seeped inexorably into all religions. Plato described the heart as two-sided, with chambers, which is echoed in the two tablets of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament, where law is written in the heart. In the Qur’an it’s made of glass, for God to see your thoughts: it must be kept clean, to reflect God back clearly. That may not have been Debbie Harry’s point, but it was her image. It was in love songs long before the Song of Solomon’s “Set me as a seal on thy heart”. The Hindu gods Sita and Rama lived in the heart of the monkey god Hanuman 9,000 years ago. It makes a noise. It’s a drum, obviously. Long ago, air was believed to pass through it: in Sufi poetry it’s the reed flute, the ney. It has strings – the anatomical cordae tendinneae. By the 17th century, emblems – illustrations of religious points for the illiterate – showed a Cupid-like little Jesus playing it as a harp. They showed hearts with wings, with eyes, even being circumcised. In some, little Jesus sweeps demons and sins out of a heart-shaped house. Chambers, right? The logic is literal. A 10th-century Chinese heart sutra is written in the form of a pagoda. Nuns in Germany embroidered dear little heart chalets in which Jesus receives a drink, while the lamb of God sits on the chimney – neatly representing the aorta. Steps up are labelled with the virtues that must be shown in order to get there. Christ’s heart-house, speared open on the cross, is open to us. (In another strand, the sacrament of his blood – the love – flowed into the Holy Grail, associating the heart with cups: “copas” was the original suit in cards which became hearts.) In Mexico, the best-looking young Aztec men were treated as gods for a year – fine food, musicians following them around, girls – before their hearts were fed to the Eagle of the Sun. (The oldest known sculptural representation of the heart is a 4,000-year-old Olmec ceramic, with two chambers, sprouting blood-vessels, and a head.) Many tribal societies would eat the heart of the enemy to acquire their strength (medieval French troubadours sang of husbands serving the wife with her lover’s heart, and Mike Tyson was still threatening to eat Lennox Lewis’s in 2000). Mexico City is founded where a magician’s heart sprouted into a prickly pear. All that syncretised neatly with Catholicism, linking back into the heart as edible fruit: the pomegranate, which represented Christ’s passion in Renaissance Europe (echoing Persephone, who also rose from the dead in spring), the grapevine that Jesus had to be (because otherwise how could his blood be wine?), even the apple that Eve tasted, discovering self-knowledge. The heart of Mary, meanwhile, was a rose – except where speared with the arrows of her seven sorrows. How the symbol skips and hops through cultures and times, echoing and shifting. In 10th-century China, a map of the feelings of the heart; in 16th-century Europe, Mercator using the shape as a projection for a map of the world. And where did that shape come from, with the scalloped top and pointy bottom? Until the 1300s, it was represented pine-cone shaped, pointy end up. Galen said it had “in medio fovum” – “in the middle a ditch or pit”. Made visible, the ditch emphasises the broken heart – open to new knowledge, to let God, or love, in, or out. As Leonard Cohen sang: “There’s a crack in everything, it’s how the light gets in.” So yes, it’s a pump. But not only.

I also use it to deglaze pans. Coconut water is common in Vietnamese cooking because there is such an abundance of it. It brings so much depth of flavour, and instead of sugar I can balance sweetness with coconut water, which is good because I don’t want my daughter to eat loads of sweets. You can use it to poach prawns, it makes them utterly delicious. Bring the coconut water to the boil, and drop in your shelled or whole prawns. When you eat them in a salad, you can suck the shell, it’s so sweet and pairs well with the meat of the prawns. That’s a really common dish in Vietnamese restaurants.

1/16/2022,"Back in February 2013, a young footballer in Sierra Leone generated a brief ripple of acclaim on social media. The footage was slightly grainy but clear enough to see Mustapha Bundu taking the ball to the byline and, as a tackle flew in, chipping the Promising Stars Under-18s goalkeeper with an improbably angled rabona that swerved, floated and dropped into the far corner. There was a fleeting pause while those watching absorbed what they had witnessed; Bundu assured his coaches at the Craig Bellamy Foundation that he had meant it and they knew his oeuvre well enough to believe him.  Internet sensations come and go with dizzying frequency nowadays but Bundu, who was 15 at the time, has lasted the course. On Sunday he will start on the right wing for Sierra Leone against Ivory Coast in a match that could seal his team’s place in the Africa Cup of Nations knockout stage. That is a remarkable billing in itself: Sierra Leone had not qualified for the tournament since 1996 with conflict, ebola and chaotic governance all intervening to varying degrees. But they held the champions, Algeria, to a deserved goalless draw in their opener and there is no reason to think the Elephants cannot at least be similarly troubled in Douala. “We all received hundreds of videos of people back home celebrating,” Bundu says of the reaction to Monday’s game. “People expected us to lose 4-0 or 5-0 but we went and stood up against them. Our goal is to be here, compete and cause an upset, not just to take part. A lot of people probably didn’t know about us but now they can see we have talented footballers.” An eclectic squad all have stories to tell. The goalkeeper Mohamed Kamara, named man of the match against Algeria, plays for East End Lions in the impoverished local league and cried upon receiving his award. A London-born contingent includes the ex-Chelsea scholar Kevin Wright, Osman Kakay of QPR, Wycombe’s Sullay Kaikai and their biggest-name recruit, the one-time Tottenham defender Steven Caulker, who debuted in the Algeria game. Sierra Leone had only played 15 games in the past five years before this tournament and this year’s selection, coached by the former Walsall player John Keister, have had scant time together. Bundu’s path has been unique. The son of a successful local coach, he came through “six or seven trials” to be one of the initial 16-strong intake at the Craig Bellamy Foundation’s academy, which was set up by the former Wales international after visiting the country and being affected by its struggle to recover from the civil war that caused horrific grief during the 1990s and beyond. “It was a massive four years in my life,” Bundu says of his time there under the guidance of Johnny McKinstry, who would later manage the national team, and a group of young British coaches including Tom Legg and Paul Westren. “Not only football-wise: we were taught how to be proper human beings.” One of Bundu’s coaches remembers how, as he prepared to travel home from Sierra Leone, he found the player had got up at 3am to see him off. Another recalls that, after a poor week of training, a frustrated Bundu insisted on being given the captain’s armband and subsequently scored six goals in his next game. His nickname was “Baller”: a gentle, caring giant whose unassuming nature belied the steely edge required to progress. The 2014 ebola outbreak caused football in Sierra Leone to shut down and it brought about the academy’s demise, too. It closed in 2016 and its finances were later investigated, but that had nothing to do with the work undertaken on the ground. Bellamy was not in it for profit: he had genuinely been trying to help and the national team is reaping the benefits. Mohamed Buya Turay, who starts on the opposite flank from Bundu, also spent time at the academy while 11 of the squad worked under McKinstry at some level. Bundu left for England in September 2014, beginning a scholarship at Hartpury college in Gloucestershire, and quickly blazed a trail through the university football scene. He had not realised that he would be allowed to play senior football, too, but discovered that his work permit accommodated a stint in 2015-16 at Hereford FC, who had formed the year before after the demise of Hereford United and were in the ninth tier. A 26-goal season followed and so did an appearance at Wembley in the FA Vase final. It was far from Tombo, the village where he had caused jaws to drop with that flash of YouTube-friendly inspiration. “It was special, crazy,” he says. “I like Manchester United and, the day before, I’d watched them beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on TV with all those big stars. The next moment I was walking out there. I wouldn’t change the experience for anything.” Among the flood of post-match congratulations on Monday were WhatsApp messages from friends made during that spell. Bundu has since forged a successful early career in Denmark with AGF Aarhus, where he is now back on loan from Anderlecht, but his time at Edgar Street left a firm legacy. Hereford Sierra Leone, an academy set up in the capital city Freetown, was formed in 2017 with help from dedicated volunteers connected to his old club and continues to thrive. “There’s so much talent in the country and hopefully they can get spotted and change their lives as well,” he says. “I’m happy with what I’ve achieved so far as a footballer and hopefully I can make the next step, but the main goal is always to give back to Sierra Leone and the kids there, to find opportunities for them so they can experience the things I have. “We want people to see the positives in our nation, football-wise but also in other areas of life, so that when you talk about Sierra Leone you aren’t just mentioning war or ebola. The aim is to get more people playing in the top leagues, the Premier League or La Liga, and I think that will come.” Rabonas or not, a repeat performance against Ivory Coast would bring that prospect closer to fruition.",Sport/Football,Sierra Leone’s Mustapha Bundu on his rise from YouTube star to Afcon ace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/sierra-leones-mustapha-bundu-on-his-rise-from-youtube-star-to-afcon-ace
