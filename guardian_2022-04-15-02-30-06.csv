In his 1992 book of the same title, Clare noted that “there is something chilling about this 20th-century ‘saint’”.

4/15/2022,"The government’s plan to force people seeking refuge in the UK to leave with a one-way ticket to Rwanda has surprised many, has few precedents, and has been condemned as cruel and unworkable. Any adult who comes into the UK without authorisation – via train, boat or plane – could be considered for relocation to Rwanda. There will be an assessment stage, where the strength of each individual’s asylum claim will be taken into account, officials said, as well as the way they arrived in the country. UK officials say it is “the strength of their claim”, but details so far are scarce, partly because they do not want to tip off people coming to the UK. Rwanda has said it will only accept adults without a criminal record. Boris Johnson has said the agreement is “uncapped” and that Rwanda will have the “capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead”. But officials believe it will take weeks, if not months, for the scheme to actually begin sending people to Rwanda. Those seeking asylum from Rwanda are not expected to be sent back there, regardless of how they entered the UK. Once someone is told they are going to be removed, they are given five days’ notice and are able to make representations during that period. Officials say most people in that period have access to legal advice. However, there is no statutory right to appeal. While in the UK, they are, officials say. But once placed on a plane, they would be the responsibility of the Rwandan government. Migrants are subject to Rwandan immigration rules as soon as they land. The Rwandan government say they will be encouraged to apply for refugee status, and will have no immediate right to return to the UK. Anyone the Rwandan authorities decide to deport – such as people who commit a crime – can be sent to the first “safe” country or their country of origin. Asylum seekers will stay in a hostel while their claims are processed. This is expected to take about three months. They will be allowed to move around freely and leave the property, Rwandan officials say. The taxpayer will foot the bill, including for the cost of chartering flights to remove detainees, but ministers are not saying how much the programme will cost. Britain has promised Rwanda an initial £120m as part of an “economic transformation and integration fund”, but the UK will be paying for operational costs too. The Home Office said a set amount of funding will be provided for each relocated person. But it declined to say how much, other than to say it will be comparable to current processing costs in the UK and cover case workers, legal advice, translators, accommodation, food and healthcare. The agreement struck with Rwanda also says the UK will resettle “a portion of Rwanda‘s most vulnerable refugees” in the UK. No, a similar agreement was signed with Israel that lasted from 2014 to 2017. Hundreds of detainees swiftly left the country. Reports claimed many returned to Europe. The Danish government has been in talks with the Rwandan government and held a series of high-profile meetings regarding returning migrants last summer. Yes. A Human Rights Watch report published last year found evidence that Rwandan authorities had arbitrarily detained over a dozen gay and transgender people ahead of a June 2021 conference, accusing them of “not representing Rwandan values”. According to the Foreign Office, homosexuality “remains frowned upon by many” and LGBTQ+ people can experience discrimination and abuse, including from local authorities. Almost certainly. Senior counsels believe that plans to send those claiming asylum to offshore centres would breach three articles of the European convention on human rights and three of the articles of the refugee convention. It could also be challenged under discrimination legislation if, for example, Ukrainians are seen to be exempt. This is an idea that has been years in the making, as the numbers of people travelling to the UK by small boats has soared. It follows a series of other outlandish plans such as pushing back boats with wave machines – which have never happened. But the idea that the UK may send refugees in large numbers to Rwanda remains so outlandish that staff in the Home Office, Border Force guards and human rights lawyers are unsure whether it will actually ever happen. However, it is certainly a distraction from Boris Johnson’s recent fine for breaking Covid rules, and is hugely popular among a cohort of backbench MPs who hold the fate of Johnson and Patel in their hands.",News/UK news,Rwanda asylum plan: who does it target and is it going to happen?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/rwanda-asylum-plan-who-does-it-target-and-is-it-going-to-happen
4/15/2022,"The UK government has imposed sanctions on Chelsea football club director Eugene Tenenbaum in an attempt to freeze up to £10bn of assets linked to the club’s Russian oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich. The UK said it was extending sanctions to Tenenbaum and David Davidovich, another close associate of Abramovich, because the oligarch had transferred billions of pounds of assets to the pair as Russia invaded Ukraine. The Foreign Office said the sanctions would “freeze assets connected with the pair estimated to total up to £10bn – the largest asset freeze action in UK history”. The department said the asset freezes would “prevent these assets from being repatriated to Russia and used to fund Putin’s war machine”. “We are tightening the ratchet on Putin’s war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin,” Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said. “We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table.” The UK said the sanctions were coordinated with Jersey, which yesterday froze £5.4bn of Abramovich’s assets. Abramovich was subjected to UK sanctions on 10 March after ministers accused him of having “clear connections” to Putin’s regime and being among a group of rich Russian business people who had “blood on their hands”. He has denied having close links to Putin. However, the UK has not seized any of Abramovich’s UK properties, which include a £120m mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens just behind the royal palace. His family have amassed a UK property collection worth more than £250m, numbering about 70 homes, buildings and pieces of land. The UK is forcing him to sell Chelsea FC, which he bought in 2003 for about £140m. Corporate filings show that Tenenbaum took control of Evrington Investments Ltd, an Abramovich-linked investment company, on 24 February, immediately after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich was previously listed as the “beneficial owner” of Cyprus-based Ervington, according to filings in London and Amsterdam. The company has made investments in at least eight firms, including in Russia’s top search engine, Yandex. Also on the first day of the invasion, Abramovich transferred control of another investment vehicle, Norma Investments, to Davidovich. The Foreign Office said Davidovich, who has been described by Forbes magazine as “Abramovich’s much lower-profile right-hand man”, “took over Evrington Investments from Tenenbaum in March 2022”. The men will be subject to asset freezes as well as transport sanctions, meaning that any ship or aircraft owned, chartered, controlled or operated by them could be detained if it enters Britain. Tenenbaum, 57, was born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union and has been on Chelsea’s board for 19 years. He was previously the head of corporate finance at Sibneft, an oil company sold in 2006 by Abramovich. He has previously described sanctions against Abramovich as “unjust”. The Guardian has approached Tenenbaum and Davidovich for comment.",News/World news,UK government imposes sanctions on Chelsea FC director Eugene Tenenbaum,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/uk-government-imposes-sanctions-on-chelsea-fc-director-eugene-tenenbaum
4/15/2022,"How much would you pay for nothing? For one private European art collector, it is $1.2m. That’s the amount paid at a recent Sotheby’s auction in Paris for a receipt written by the French artist Yves Klein to prove the ownership of one of his “invisible art” pieces – now being billed by collectors as a precursor to NFTs. Klein, a key figure in the French new realism movement founded in the 1960s, was a pioneer in performance art. In 1958, he launched The Void, an exhibition in which he placed a cabinet in an empty room. It was a success, with thousands of visitors showing up to the mostly vacant Parisian gallery. Soon after, Klein decided to offer collectors the opportunity to buy invisible “zones” in exchange for gold bullion. Each purchase of one of Klein’s Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility came with a receipt, which he urged buyers to burn. According to Smithsonian Magazine, the burning was part of a ritual in which Klein wanted collectors to assert themselves as “definitive owners” of their “zones”. Klein would then dump half the gold payment into the Seine River and burn the receipts among witnesses. One of the collectors, Jacques Kugel, refused to burn his receipt. It has become a valued piece of art in its own right, displayed at various cultural institutions such as the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Hayward Gallery in London. Loïc Malle, a former gallery owner, eventually bought the receipt and auctioned it off along with other items from his private collection. The receipt measures less than 8in wide and is designed to mimic a bank check. It features Klein’s signature on the bottom right and is dated 7 December 1959. “Some have likened the transfer of a zone of sensitivity and the invention of receipts as an ancestor of the NFT, which itself allows the exchange of immaterial works,” Sotheby’s wrote in its auction catalog. “The Zones were the apotheosis of Klein’s lifelong quest to create an artwork which was ‘a direct and immediate perception – assimilation without any effect, any trick, or any deception’. In other words, he was aiming to directly transmit the power of painting – its sensibility – without depending on the painting-artifact to act as a medium,” it added. “Klein considered for a long time how exactly these Zones … should be sold. Eventually, he settled on a system which is the spiritual precursor for the model we are seeing used for the sale of digital art via NFT: he created a separate artifact for the financial aspect of the artwork. This was the humble, but brilliant, receipt.” For the first time ever, Sotheby’s accepted cryptocurrency payments for the artwork. According to Smithsonian, the sale surpassed the initial estimated range of $300,000 to $500,000 and instead was settled on $1.2m after fees. The individual who purchased the receipt was a “private European collector” and that it remains “too early to say” whether they will pay via cryptocurrencies, the auction house said.",Arts/Art and design,Money for nothing: receipt for ‘invisible art’ sells for $1.2m,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/14/receipt-for-invisible-art-auction-yves-klein
4/15/2022,"A government fund designed to replace EU grants lost due to Brexit has been criticised as “nothing more than an outrage” that will leave English regions tens of millions of pounds worse off than when Britain was in the EU. The Conservative’s 2019 manifesto promised “at a minimum” to match the average EU subsidy of about £1.5bn a year to help the most deprived parts of the UK. But details of the government’s Shared Prosperity Fund show that it will hand out only £2.6bn over the next three years and will not match the previous EU funding level of £1.5bn a year until 2025. The settlement has been strongly criticised by thinktanks and political leaders including the Welsh government, which said it was due to lose out on more than £1bn in unreplaced funding over the next three years. The thinktank IPPR North said the government’s Shared Prosperity Fund was a 43% cut in real terms compared with the average annual EU grants of £1.5bn between 2014 and 2020. Dan Jarvis, the South Yorkshire mayor, said his region was owed £900m in funding to match what it would have received if the UK had remained in the EU. However, it has received little more than £38m over a three-year period. He said: “This announcement is nothing more than an outrage; a cynical Conservative con that utterly fails South Yorkshire and drives a coach and horses through the government’s levelling-up agenda.” The Department for Levelling Up insisted that it was “delivering on the UK government’s commitment to match the average spending of EU structural funds” by matching the EU’s £1.5bn in 2025. It said areas would continue to receive EU funding until the end of 2024. However, regional leaders and policy experts accused the government of using “smoke and mirrors” by counting old EU money over the next two years. The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, which is chaired by the former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, said regions in the north of England would receive up to 37% less funding under the new government fund than they would from the EU. In north-east England, one of the most deprived regions of the UK, this amounted to a difference of £71.3m over the next three years, it said.

However, this includes a count of old EU money still being delivered to these areas. IPPR North said the government’s promise to match EU funding was “far from reality” in two out of the next three financial years. It described the announcement as a “serious blow for levelling up” that would stifle ambitious long-term investment. Whereas EU grants were delivered over seven years, the Shared Prosperity Fund model is for only three years. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, said: “The UK Shared Prosperity Fund will help to unleash the creativity and talent of communities that have for too long been overlooked and undervalued.”",News/Politics,‘An outrage’: Tories’ post-Brexit fund will not match EU grants until 2025,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/14/an-outrage-tories-post-brexit-fund-will-not-match-eu-grants-until-2025
4/15/2022,"UK diplomats are working to determine the whereabouts of British nationals in Ukraine amid reports a man from Nottinghamshire has been captured by pro-Moscow forces while serving with the Ukrainian military. Aiden Aslin, who is from Newark and has been fighting in the besieged city of Mariupol, was forced to surrender with his comrades earlier this week after they ran out of food and ammunition. An image that purported to show a beaten, bruised and handcuffed Aslin was posted on a Twitter account belonging to him on Thursday afternoon. A message accompanying it – apparently written by a third party controlling the account – read: “Just got this, it looks as if they have gotten ahold of Aiden.” It claimed those holding Aslin had “worked him over” and vowed to keep his case “in the public eye every day until he’s exchanged”. A later message added: “Some people have asked why he should get special coverage when there are so many prisoners. I have no answer for you, but I have a friend in danger so I’m using the tools he gave me to help.” Foreign Office sources said they were working to verify reports about British nationals caught up in fighting in Ukraine after the picture emerged. Officials said that, given the situation in Ukraine, their ability to obtain information and provide consular services on the ground was severely limited. They added that they expected any detainees to be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law. After the news emerged, Aslin’s local MP Robert Jenrick said he was working with the Foreign Office to “track the whereabouts and secure the release of my constituent, Aiden Aslin. Aiden chose to risk his life because he believes passionately in the Ukrainian people’s right to live in freedom and democracy”. Aslin’s mother, Ang Wood previously told the BBC her son’s unit had “put up one hell of a fight”, but had been left with no choice but to surrender because they had “no weapons left”. She called on Boris Johnson to find a way to “take Putin down”. In a Facebook post on Monday, the last Ukrainian soldiers defending Mariupol said they were “running out of ammunition” and expected to be killed or taken prisoner very soon. “We were bombed from airplanes and shot at by artillery and tanks. We have been doing everything possible and impossible. But any resource has the potential to run out,” said the 36th brigade.",News/World news,British man captured in Ukraine reportedly pictured beaten and handcuffed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/british-man-captured-in-ukraine-reportedly-pictured-beaten-and-handcuffed
4/15/2022,"My friend Valerie West, who has died aged 94, had a long and distinguished career in the theatre, first in stage management for opera and ballet at the Sadler’s Wells theatre and later for the British Council. She was born in Muswell Hill, north London, and brought up by her mother, Gwen West (nee Stodart), who worked in an advertising agency, SH Bentley; Val’s parents divorced after her father, Reginald – also in advertising – abandoned the family. Val went to Ashford school for girls in Kent, and was evacuated with the school to Devon during the second world war. On her return, aged 17, she took her first job as secretary and assistant stage manager at Sadler’s Wells, which reopened after the war in June 1945 with the premiere of Benjamin Britten’s Peter Grimes. During the opera’s run, Val provided the scream for the apprentice, who had lost his voice. For this she was personally auditioned by Britten. After 12 years with the company, she left to freelance as a stage manager. Her first job was a revue called Share My Lettuce (1957), starring Maggie Smith and Kenneth Williams. She found the work surprising. The world of ballet tends to be deadly serious, but with such a cast they never stopped laughing during the rehearsals. In 1960 she moved to the British Council, organising foreign tours of drama and ballet. In those days, culture was used as a way of promoting Britain and the British Council had three tours officers, of whom she was one. She loved the variety that the work encompassed. If, occasionally, it might entail swanning around the capitals of Europe liaising with embassy staff, more often she would be facilitating a tour round less-than-ideal venues. One of her first jobs was managing a tour of Shakespeare plays across west Africa, physically getting the performances on to whatever stage was offered. Val was rightly proud of her work with the British Council, which took her all over the world. She worked for the organisation for 27 years, producing tours of all the leading British theatre, ballet and opera companies, as well as smaller groups. She was furious that rules meant that she had to retire at 60, but by then she was head of the touring department and in 1986 was appointed MBE. Her interest in theatre did not wane in retirement, and she rarely missed new productions in London. Ballet remained her special love and her knowledge was encyclopedic. She had no close family but a large number of friends, who appreciated her erudition, dry wit and kindness.",Arts/Stage,Valerie West obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/apr/14/valerie-west-obituary
4/15/2022,"Uncertainty across Europe about the precise definition of “foul play” in rugby union shows no sign of easing after the decision to give Leicester’s Guy Porter a three-week ban for an off-the-ball collision with Clermont’s Fritz Lee in Sunday’s Champions Cup last-16 tie. The original red card has been upheld and Porter will now miss Saturday’s second leg at Welford Road. Leicester and Porter contested the charge but an independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Wales’s Roger Morris, found the Tigers centre “had committed a reckless act of foul play” even though neither player had the ball and the head clash looked accidental. The offence was deemed to be in the mid-range category of World Rugby sanctions but Porter’s suspension was halved because of his previously clear disciplinary record. Both the player and European Professional Club Rugby have the right to appeal, which demonstrates the determination of rugby’s authorities to try to minimise head contact in the game. The case, however, sets a big precedent given Porter was fully entitled to try to close down the space available to Clermont’s midfield at pace, had his eyes fixed on the ball-carrying Camille Lopez and was not actively seeking contact with Lee. That was not how the panel, which included the former Ireland fly-half David Humphreys and ex-Scotland coach Frank Hadden, ultimately saw it, despite a submission in Porter’s defence from Leicester Tigers’ general manager, Leigh Jones. Porter is free to play on 27 April but will be available 48 hours earlier if he completes a World Rugby tackle technique awareness course. The verdict comes on the same day as a five-week ban was given to Brive’s full-back Axel Muller for what the panel ruled was an intentional head-high tackle on Saracens’ Ben Harris. A separate disciplinary panel, chaired by England’s Samantha Hillas QC, identified it as a top-end offence but slashed the 10-week tariff by 50 per cent because of the player’s guilty plea and previous clean record. For a clearly dangerous, intentional high hit to sideline the culprit for just two weeks more than the unfortunate Porter underlines the increasing lack of consistency in disciplinary outcomes. Leinster’s Jamison Gibson-Park, for example, had his citing case dismissed after an upright tackle against Connacht in which he caught Kieran Marmion’s head with his shoulder. As a result Gibson-Park is available to start the second leg in Dublin as Leinster look to nail down a potential quarter-final against Leicester. The Irish province also welcome back their international front-rowers Andrew Porter and Ronan Kelleher for Friday’s tea-time kick-off at the Aviva Stadium. In Friday’s other tie, Bristol, seeking to protect a one-point advantage from the first leg in Salford, have again selected Charles Piutau and Semi Radradra on the bench for the rematch with Sale at Ashton Gate. Radradra scored the only try of the game last week but Lam believes his chosen starting XV is better suited to neutering Sale’s direct style of play. The Sharks director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, has made one starting change, the fit-again Tom Roebuck replacing Jack Metcalf. The England scrum-half Raffi Quirke has a hamstring injury, however, so Gus Warr will be the bench understudy to Faf de Klerk. Remarkably all but one of Sale’s pack and both half-backs hail from South Africa, with another three of their compatriots on the bench. In the Challenge Cup the soon-to-retire Sean O’Brien is at No 8 for London Irish against Castres, while Wasps will field Brad Shields, Jack Willis and Alfie Barbeary in their starting back-row for the home game against Biarritz.

4/15/2022,"Police in South Africa have used stun grenades to disperse a crowd calling for more and better official aid for victims of the lethal floods earlier this week. The demonstration on Thursday briefly blocked a major highway in the eastern city of Durban, where more than 300 people have died in flooding in recent days. The president, Cyril Ramaphosa, described a “catastrophe of enormous proportions” and attributed the disaster to the climate emergency. South Africa is bracing for more heavy rain in districts hit by the record-breaking rainfall earlier this week. “It is telling us that climate change is serious, it is here,” Ramaphosa said as he visited the flooded metropolitan area of eThekwini, which includes Durban, on Wednesday. “We no longer can postpone what we need to do, and the measures we need to take to deal with climate change.” Analysts have frequently raised concerns that climate change will place huge stress on already unstable or weak countries, worsening existing problems and forcing cash-strapped governments to use scarce resources to offer relief or rebuild after extreme weather events. The South African weather service has warned of continuing high wind and rain bringing the risk of more flooding in KwaZulu-Natal and some other provinces over the Easter weekend. Meteorologists said the flooding had taken them by surprise. Some parts of KwaZulu-Natal recorded almost their average annual rainfall in 48 hours. “While impact-based warnings were indeed issued in a timely manner, it appears that the exceptionally heavy rainfall exceeded even the expectations of the southern African meteorological community at large,” a statement from the weather service said. The service said that although it was impossible to attribute an individual event to the climate crisis, “we can state with confidence that globally (as a direct result of global warming and associated climate change), all forms of severe and extreme weather … are becoming more frequent and more extreme than in the recent past. In other words, heavy rain events such as the current incident can … be expected to recur in the future and with increasing frequency.” The death toll is expected to increase as search-and-rescue operations continue, officials said, and the full extent of the destruction becomes clear. Thousands of people have been made homeless by the floods, roads and bridges were destroyed, and at least 248 schools have been damaged. In one township a Methodist church was swept away. A Hindu temple was badly damaged in Umhlatuzana, Chatsworth, near Durban, after a river burst its banks. Elsewhere, flooding triggered huge landslides. Durban’s port, the busiest in southern Africa, was also badly hit. In Amaoti, a township north of Durban, residents balanced precariously on the edge of a broken road, trying to fetch clean water from a broken pipe underneath. The flooding destroyed water pipes and power cables across large parts of Durban and the surrounding eThekwini metropolitan area, and it will take at least a week to restore those services, officials in Durban said. NGOs were scrambling on Thursday to bring relief to badly hit communities. The damage to Durban and the surrounding eThekwini metropolitan area is estimated at 757m rand (£39m), the mayor of eThekwini, Mxolisi Kaunda, said on Thursday. At least 120 schools have been flooded, causing damage estimated at more than 380m rand and bringing officials to temporarily close all schools in the province. At least 18 students and one teacher have died in the floods, the education minister, Angie Motshekga, said. “This is a catastrophe and the damage is unprecedented. What is even more worrying is that more rain is expected in the same areas that are already affected.” Volunteers said they were desperate to source food, clothes and other essentials. In a pitch-dark hall in Durban’s Glebelands hostel district, volunteers used the torches from their mobile phones to register scores of displaced people overnight. “We are just helping the people because we care,” said Mabheki Sokhela, 51, who helped organise temporary shelter at a community hall. The ruling African National Congress, in power for nearly 30 years, has frequently been criticised for inadequate responses to natural disasters. Rescue efforts by the South African National Defence Force were delayed as the military’s air wing was affected by the floods, but the military has now deployed personnel and helicopters to bring in humanitarian relief. Rain continued in parts of Durban on Wednesday afternoon and a flood warning was issued for the neighbouring province of Eastern Cape. Durban was the centre of deadly riots last July that killed more than 350 people, South Africa’s worst unrest since the end of apartheid.",News/World news,South African police disperse crowd calling for aid after flooding,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/south-african-police-disperse-crowd-calling-for-aid-after-flooding
4/15/2022,"Detailing plans to send unauthorised migrants to Rwanda, Boris Johnson managed to blame “politically motivated lawyers” for forcing the government to draw up such a drastic policy, and also for any future failure to implement it. By blaming them for Britain being seen as “a soft touch for illegal migration”, continuing a government narrative against “lefty lawyers”, many in the profession believe the prime minister is putting a fig leaf over a policy that is likely to be extremely difficult to defend in the courts and may end up at the European court of human rights. Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said that while detail was lacking, sending asylum seekers to a repressive country was dangerous and potentially unlawful. “That suits the government because I’m sure the Home Office will have been advised that these aspects of policy risk being struck down by the courts, but it’s just part of their overall strategy of picking fights with lawyers and courts – then they can blame them for the policy not working,” he said. While Johnson expressed confidence that the policy was fully compliant with international legal obligations, lawyers have their doubts. A joint opinion on the nationality and borders bill by four barristers, led by the human rights and immigration QC Raza Husain, found that the offshore processing of asylum claims would risk breaching articles of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and the refugee convention, including in the latter case those relating to “prohibition of expulsion” and “non-discrimination”. Additionally, they found a risk of breaching the UK’s obligation to implement the refugee convention in good faith. Although what the government has announced is not offshore processing, it is arguably even more problematic from a legal perspective, involving removal – or expulsion, as the refugee convention puts it – to Rwanda, a regime with a dubious human rights record. Sailesh Mehta, a human rights barrister at Red Lion chambers, said: “The UNHCR [UN refugee agency] warns against the externalisation of our obligations.” Johnson has said he is anticipating a legal challenge, and he is unlikely to be disappointed. But before then he has the already tricky task of getting through parliament the nationality and borders bill, which paves the way for offshore processing. The government has twice been defeated in the House of Lords over several provisions in the bill, including offshore processing. The announcement regarding Rwanda illustrates a determination to press on rather than accept the amendments, but equally it may entrench the opposition in the Lords, particularly in light of the legal warnings. Stephanie Boyce, president of the Law Society of England and Wales, which represents solicitors, criticised the government with a not so subtle reference to the Partygate fines. “The government is announcing this scheme before parliament has approved the necessary powers,” Boyce said. “There are serious questions about whether these plans would or could comply with the UK’s promises under international treaty – for instance, if people were in practice prevented from claiming asylum in the UK altogether, or if the government were in effect to pre-judge claims for asylum from a particular group of people. “It is particularly disappointing – this week of all weeks – the government is repeating misleading suggestions that legal challenges are politically motivated.

4/15/2022,"Of all of the elementary milestones that Emma Raducanu had not yet notched up before she won the US Open so early into her career, few are as unbelievable as what awaits her as she leads Great Britain into battle against the Czech Republic in Prague on her Billie Jean King Cup debut. On Friday, Raducanu will compete in a professional clay court match for the first time. As she has prepared for this moment in recent weeks, Raducanu’s unfamiliarity on the surface is reflected on her body: “I have no toenails,” said Raducanu, laughing, after the draw ceremony. “Just my foot, my shoes, they’ve just been sliding around a lot.” Anne Keothavong, the GB captain, joked that the rest of the team is “scarred” by the sight of her nails. Raducanu remembers travelling to the Czech Republic to compete in a junior club league on clay aged 11, one of her first tennis trips abroad. Otherwise, her clay court experience amounts to a few brief summers on the surface and nine ITF junior tournaments, her last match coming four years ago. How clay matches up with her game will be an interesting sight. Raducanu has so far enjoyed her success on grass and faster hard courts that complement her preference for taking the ball on the rise inside the baseline. The slow, high-bouncing clay rewards those who are also capable of carefully opening the court by generating topspin and width from behind it. “I genuinely believe that clay could be one of my strongest surfaces because [of] the moving aspect,” she said. “I do like moving … because I feel like I have a lot more potential physically. And I do enjoy sliding. After spending more time on this surface I’m sure I’ll time it better and learn more about the surface, but also just the time that clay brings,” said Raducanu. At the beginning of the month, Raducanu spent a number of days training on clay at the Piatti tennis centre in Italy. Rumours circulated about further personnel changes in her team, but she explained that she had opted to train there in order to adapt to clay courts while her coach, Torben Beltz, took a holiday with his family. “Of course he needed that family time. So I thought I might as well take the opportunity to go to Italy and spend some more time on the dirt,’ she said. This has been a tough first full season so far for Raducanu, with a 2-5 win-loss record, various injury niggles and many tight three-set losses from winning positions. But expectations are extremely low on clay and she may well enjoy being more under the radar for now. A young Great Britain team stands alongside her as they look for an unlikely victory. Harriet Dart continues to sit around her new career high ranking after breaking the top 100 with her recent run to the Indian Wells fourth round last month. However, she is also unproven on clay. The squad is completed by 23-year-old Katie Swan and 20-year-old Sonay Kartal. After struggling with injuries in recent years, Kartal has flitted up the rankings swiftly. She was unranked and inactive at the beginning of October, yet has since compiled a 31-3 record on the ITF circuit, catapulting her to a career high ranking of 370th. She and Raducanu, who calls Kartal a “ball machine”, grew up together, forming a rivalry immortalized by the viral video of them playing an endless rally against each other aged nine: “I’d always end up playing you in the final and we would just alternate between who would win that week,” said Kartal, addressing Raducanu. “But, I mean, I’m still proud of that on-the-run forehand past you.” What awaits Great Britain as they attempt to win the qualifier and reach the Billie Jean King Cup finals later this year is the enormous challenge of facing the defining women’s team over the past decade, with the Czechs winning six BJK Cup titles since 2011. Despite being without their top three players, Barbora Krejcikova, Karolina Pliskova and Petra Kvitova, plus Katerina Siniakova, the doubles No 1, their depth is so great that they can still easily piece together a solid, deep team, and they remain considerable favourites. The 2019 French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova, ranked 32nd, will open up the tie against Dart and then No 50 Tereza Martincova will face Raducanu. Waiting in the wings is the immensely talented Karolina Muchova, who is only ranked outside of the top 20 because of significant injury issues, and Marie Bouzkova. Even their fifth selection is a statement, the talented 16-year-old Linda Fruhvirtova, underlining a dominant era that is far from over.",Sport/Sport,‘No toenails left’: Emma Raducanu puts in hard yards for first feat of clay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/emma-raducanu-clay-debut-billie-jean-king-cup-great-brtiain
4/15/2022,"Jürgen Klopp believes Manchester City did not see the best of Liverpool on Sunday and could face a sterner challenge when the rivals meet again in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final. The Liverpool manager made seven changes from the 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium for Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Benfica, while City survived a bruising encounter at Atlético Madrid, including 12 minutes of stoppage time, before also reaching the semi-finals. Klopp disputes that the contrast in preparations will enhance Liverpool’s prospects at Wembley, but he expects improvement from his team regardless because, in his opinion, they fell short in several departments in the Premier League encounter. Klopp said: “We had it last week before we played City. We had an away game [in Lisbon] and arrived home in the middle of the next day. Travelling is intense, definitely. Will it give us at advantage? I have no idea. “We will see. It was for both teams intense [on Wednesday]. City was really strong last week and we were not at our best, so I would like to see a game where we are at our best as well. That would be interesting. “The boys did a lot of good stuff in the game, but I really think in a couple of positions we are able to perform on a completely different level and I think we should give that a try. And it’s a Cup game, a one-off. If it’s 2-2 again, it’s 120 minutes and if it stays like that it’s penalties and that would be really crazy if it goes all the way. “I want to have 12 games from now until the end of the season and be in the finals. It’s tough but it’s still the best schedule to have because it means you are in all the competitions as long as possible. I’m really looking forward to the game. Wembley is a big pitch, we have to cover a lot of grass and run a lot and close big gaps, but I think it will be cool.” Diogo Jota is Liverpool’s only fitness concern, although Klopp expects the Portugal international to recover from the knock sustained against Benfica. Klopp admits he and Pep Guardiola have made tactical changes to stifle each other in recent years, but not at the expense of quality entertainment. “Over the years you notice changes,” he said. “We had some decent counterattacks in the past and then Pep decided full-backs couldn’t go past the halfway line. We did similar things, we try to deny them as well. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. “There are decisive challenges in a game and you better win them otherwise they are in a really good position. We lost a couple of easy balls in the City game a few days ago and what they made of it was spectacular, like the counter in the first minute when Ali [Alisson] made a great save from [Raheem] Sterling. It’s just good football, but the goals we scored were really good situations as well. “It’s a really intense fight on a really high level. The concentration levels that all the boys have to bring on to the pitch is insane. When tactical things match each other it can be tactically really interesting, but horribly boring for the neutral. That rarely happens in games between City and Liverpool and that’s good for all the fans who watch.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester City yet to see Liverpool at their best, claims Jürgen Klopp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/manchester-city-yet-to-see-liverpool-at-their-best-says-jurgen-klopp
4/15/2022,"Alexei Navalny has called for an “information front” against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the jailed opposition leader asserted that poll results showing 75% of Russians support the conflict were a “Kremlin lie”. In an extended series of tweets, Navalny called on western leaders to support a massive social media ad campaign in order to break through Kremlin propaganda regarding the invasion. “We need ads. Lots of ads,” wrote Navalny. “A huge national anti-war campaign will start with an advertising campaign. Two hundred million impressions a day to reach every Russian internet user twice. Stories, posts and prerolls. Across Russia, in cities and villages. On every tablet and every phone.” He called on Joe Biden, Boris Johnson, Ursula von der Leyen, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, the head of Google owner Alphabet, to “urgently find a solution to crush [Vladimir] Putin’s propaganda using the advertising power of social media”. The advertising campaign would be a way around the Kremlin’s efforts to shut down independent media in Russia. Along with most independent websites and newspapers, the Russian censor has also blocked access to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It also marks the opposition leader’s biggest foray yet into the complicated question of how widely the Russian public supports the war in Ukraine. Polling results, including from the independent Levada Centre, have shown majority support among Russians for the war. But critics have cited poor polling techniques, low response rates and other mitigating factors to argue that many Russians are simply too afraid to voice their opposition to the war. Then there are the efforts of pro-Kremlin programming, which has come to dominate television schedules in recent months as entertainment programmes have been pushed off all the main government channels. “The fact is that most Russian citizens have a completely distorted view of what is happening in Ukraine,” Navalny wrote in messages passed to his supporters. “For them, Putin is waging a small, very successful war with very little bloodshed. Our soldiers are heroes and there are hardly any casualties.” For the same price as a javelin anti-tank missile, he argued, western leaders could attract 200m ad views or “at least 8m views on a video with the truth about what is happening in Ukraine”. Russia has pulled its troops back from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv but is preparing for a new offensive in Ukraine’s east. Putin has said that Russia’s war will “continue until its full completion and the goals that have been set are fulfilled”.",News/World news,Alexei Navalny calls for social media ‘information front’ against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/alexei-navalny-calls-for-social-media-information-front-against-russia
4/15/2022,"The decision to switch the All-Weather Championships card from Lingfield to Newcastle also means that Tyrrhenian Sea returns to the track where he reeled off a mid-winter hat-trick, and he is likely to start at odds-on for his in-form trainer, Roger Varian, in the Betway Easter Classic at the end of the card. The four-year-old looked like one of the unluckiest losers of the all-weather campaign when only fourth at odd-on at Kempton Park last month, and he is better judged on a very cosy win from an opening mark of 87 on his handicap debut in February. His five rivals all arrive with more experience and Living Legend will be a danger if Joe Fanning gets loose on the lead, but Tyrrhenian Sea (4.45) is top on the ratings and has more scope for improvement too so it will be tough to deny him a fourth win from five starts. Newcastle 2.00 My Oberon was a respectable sixth in the Dubai Turf less than three weeks ago but provided he is over that, he is the clear form pick on his win in a qualifier on Tapeta at Southwell in February. Lingfield 2.20 Tough to rule out any of the dozen runners here with confidence, but Asadjumeirah has the best individual piece of recent form – an easy win at Newcastle in February – and has not has not done much wrong in his three starts since. Newcastle 2.35 Ejtilaab put up a career-best performance – in the 19th race of his career – at Kempton last month to win a handicap off 105 and anything close to that level will make him difficult to beat here. Lingfield 2.55 Zameka made his debut in a hot race at Kempton in November and is a potential handicap blot off 81. He has done all his racing at seven furlongs so far, however, and at the likely odds, Aasser, a winner in a solid time at Wolverhampton in December, makes more appeal. Newcastle 3.10 Probably best to focus on El Caballo and Tiber Flow, who are both proven over track and trip and have a combined record of seven wins from eight starts. Marginal preference is for the unbeaten second-favourite, who had more in hand than the half-length margin implies on his handicap debut at Southwell last month. Newcastle 3.45 Highfield Princess was beaten three lengths in the Champions Sprint at Ascot in October, has winning form at this trip and could get a soft lead as she is the only regular front-runner in the field.

4/15/2022,"Energy bills will stay well above £2,000 for two more years, according to leading analysts, who warned that prolonged high prices threaten the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s loan scheme to help households cope with sky-high gas prices amid the mounting cost of living crisis. Cornwall Insights, which predicted the recent 54% rise in the cap on average energy bills to £1,971, said it had increased its forecasts for upcoming changes to the ceiling, which is determined by the energy regulator, Ofgem. It warned that prices staying higher for longer would undermine Sunak’s plan to ease the pressure on household finances by giving bill payers a one-off £200 discount on bills, paid back in £40 instalments over five years. Cornwall left its prediction for the coming winter unchanged, estimating that the price cap will hit £2,607, meaning households will have seen their bills double in the space of a year. While it expects the cap to fall from that record high, it no longer expects a significant drop. Its forecast for the winter period starting in 2023 is now £2,284, up from a prediction of £2,040 made at the end of March. Cornwall analysts believe the price cap will still be as high as £2,233 by spring 2024. The change comes after gas prices stopped dropping sharply and began to level off, with the risk now weighted towards further increases. Craig Lowrey, the principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, urged the government to come up with new measures to help households cope with bills and reconsider its omission of energy efficiency from Boris Johnson’s energy security strategy, unveiled last week. “The cheapest energy is that which you don’t use, so to reduce bills for consumers, the government really must look again at how to support reductions in energy consumption for all consumers, including those in fuel poverty,” Lowery said. “The exclusion of material new policies for energy efficiency in the energy security strategy were a missed opportunity. While the government has already offered some support for consumers to pay their energy bills this year, this was before forecasts began predicting further rises, and over a longer period. “It is possible the government could take further action in the autumn, but we have no guarantees that further support will be forthcoming. “Of course, many of the variables which drive our forecasts can change before the cap setting periods for next year, but the risk is weighted to the upwards rather than downwards pressure on the price cap right now. “And with costs of living rising, and inflation hitting a record high in March before the cap rise of 1 April feeds through, then even the potential for these sorts of cap levels to arise in 2023 will be concerning for hard hit households.”",News/Business,"Energy bills forecast to remain above £2,000 in blow to Sunak’s loan scheme",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/energy-bills-forecast-to-remain-above-2000-in-blow-to-sunaks-loan-scheme
