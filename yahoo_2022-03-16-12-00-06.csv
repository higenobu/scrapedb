3/16/2022,"Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s disgraced former national security advisor, wants you to know he’s the “last guy” who would be an apologist for Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader currently conducting a murderous attack on Ukraine. Flynn would also like you to know, however, that Putin’s invasion “has now upset” plans for a “New World Order” organized by people like billionaire Bill Gates, who are (somehow) pushing to eliminate “God and a soul.” More from Rolling Stone 'We Would Die Under Moscow.' Odesa Unites To Resist Putin's Invasion Russian Journalist in Court After Protesting Ukraine Invasion During State TV Broadcast Meet the Ukrainian Mothers Who Won't Leave While Their Sons Are at War That is a conspiracy theory word salad from Flynn, but it goes toward a dangerous end: setting up Putin as a hero to a host of conspiracy theorists and covering for an invasion that has caused mass death and suffering in Ukraine. “Someone like Vladimir Putin has upset this balance of the New World Order they were trying to achieve by going into Ukraine. And you know, I’m probably the last person that’s going to be a Putin apologist. I won’t be, but what I do understand are the dynamics that are playing out in Ukraine right now,” Flynn said on March 8 during an appearance on Thrivetime Show, a podcast hosted by anti-vaxx commentator Clay Clark. Together, Flynn and Clark have organized the Reawaken America tour, a far-right event traveling to cities across the U.S. featuring conspiracy-pushing speakers such as Eric Trump, Roger Stone, and MyPillow Guy Mike Lindell. Flynn continued his rant on Clark’s podcast by claiming that the World Economic Forum and billionaires like Gates are angry with Putin for invading Ukraine and ruining their plans for world domination. “All of what we are seeing play out in Europe right now is an upsetting of the balance of the world order as they want it—as people like [Israeli professor and historian] Dr. [Yuval Noah] Harari, as people like Klaus Schwab [founder of the World Economic Forum] and others,” Flynn said. “Bill Gates is another one.” These individuals, Flynn claimed, “are very smart, they’re very well resourced, and they have a very sort of strategic idea of how they want to see the world develop.” He added, “God and a soul are not part of that strategy.” According to the Anti-Defamation League, Schwab and others have been accused by conspiracy theorists of trying to use the Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity to “reorganize global societies and economies to their benefit” while implementing a “global totalitarian regime” led by the rich and powerful. The conspiracy theory, known as “The Great Reset,” stems from a report by the same name issued by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in June 2020. According to WEF, “’The Great Reset’ is a commitment to jointly and urgently build the foundations of our economic and social system for a more fair, sustainable and resilient future.” But conspiracy theorists see “The Great Reset” as a threat to people everywhere as the global elite concentrate their power and control. Flynn’s attempt to link Ukraine back to his pet conspiracies muddies the waters, painting Putin as a resistor of global elites, rather than a cruel autocrat invading a sovereign nation to secure his legacy, no matter how many people die as a result.

3/16/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea’s latest weapons launch on Wednesday apparently ended in failure, South Korea’ military said, amid speculation that the North could soon launch its biggest long-range missile in its most significant provocation in years. It wasn’t immediately clear what North Korea launched on Wednesday morning or at what stage it had an apparent failure. But the launch, the 10th of its kind this year, shows North Korea is determined to press ahead on its push to modernize its weapons arsenal and pressure its rivals into making concessions amid dormant denuclearization talks. South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing details of the launch made from the Pyongyang region around 9:30 a.m. that apparently failed, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that didn't have further details. Experts say past failures still have moved North Korea closer to its goal of acquiring a viable nuclear arsenal that could threaten the American homeland. Of eight “Musudan” intermediate-range missiles tests in 2016, only one of those launches was seen by outside analysts as successful, which led to debates of whether North Korea’s path toward ICBMs had been cut off. However, the North in 2017 flew more powerful intermediate-range missiles over Japan and conducted three successful test-flights of ICBMs that demonstrated a potential range to strike deep into the U.S. mainland. If North Korea makes a new ICBM launch, it would be its highest-profile weapons tests since those tests more than four years ago. The U.S. and South Korean militaries said last week that North Korea had tested an ICBM system in two recent launches, referring to the developmental Hwasong-17 missile that North Korea unveiled during a military parade in October 2020. In the two recent launches on Feb. 27 and March 5, the North Korean missiles flew medium-range distances, and experts have said North Korea could eventually perform a full-range ICBM test. The North has said it tested cameras and other systems for a spy satellite and released what it said were photos taken from space during one of the two tests, but it didn’t confirm what rocket or missile it launched. Experts say North Korea aims to boost its ICBM capability while trying to place its first spy satellite into orbit. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to acquire an improved ICBM and a spy satellite among an array of sophisticated weapons systems he says he needs to cope with what he calls American hostility. The Hwasong-17 is North Korea’s biggest missile, which could potentially fly up to 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles), far enough to strike anywhere in the U.S. and beyond. The 25-meter (82-foot) missile, which was shown again at a defense exhibition in Pyongyang last year, has yet to be test-launched. The three ICBMs that North Korea tested in 2017 were the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15. Some analysts say developing a larger missile could mean the country is trying to arm its long-range weapons with multiple warheads to overcome missile defense systems. Other missiles tested this year were mostly short-range, nuclear-capable weapons which place South Korea and Japan, both key U.S. allies, within striking distance.",World/Associated Press,Seoul: North Korean launch apparently ends in failure,https://news.yahoo.com/seoul-north-korean-launch-apparently-012145942.html
3/16/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The number of women who died by suicide in Japan rose for a second straight year in 2021 although the overall number of people who took their own lives in the country edged down, police said on Tuesday. Suicide has a long history in Japan as a way of avoiding shame or dishonour, and its suicide rate had long topped the Group of Seven nations, but a concerted national effort brought numbers down by roughly 40 percent over 15 years - although they rose in 2020 due to stresses brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, the Health Ministry said. While the overall number of suicides edged down by 74 to 21,007 from the year before, the number of women who took their own lives rose by 42 to 7,068, the second straight year of increase, according to data from the National Police Agency. By contrast, the number of men who died by suicide decreased by 116 to 13,939. No explanations for the difference were immediately available, but officials have previously said the coronavirus pandemic placed extra stresses on women due to a number of reasons, including job losses in the service and retail sectors where women tend to work. The number of suicides peaked at 34,427 in 2003, alarming policymakers who drew up a comprehensive prevention programme launched in 2007. By 2019, just before the coronavirus struck, suicides had decreased to just over 20,000.
