1/21/2022,"Scott Morrison has so little love for the scrutiny of parliament that his government scheduled as few as 10 sitting days before the May election. Anyone watching the Prayer and Pushback web conference on Friday, a beauty parade of anti-lockdown, anti-vaccination mandate MPs and senators drawn from the crossbench and Coalition backbench, could see why.  In addition to Labor questions on free rapid antigen tests in question time, Friday’s event confirmed Morrison can look forward to a bin fire of pandemic policy dissent when parliament resumes in February. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, and senator Malcolm Roberts both said they would refuse to vote for Coalition bills until the federal government intervenes to roll back state-based vaccination mandates and border restrictions. In November, One Nation’s anti-mandate bill attracted five Coalition senators to cross the floor. On Friday, Hanson said Liberals Alex Antic and Gerard Rennick intended to continue their stand not to support government bills, which Rennick confirmed to Guardian Australia. Minor parties used the event as a curtain-raiser for fresh demands leading into the election, in a bid to win support from voters who feel, despite the surge in Omicron cases, hospitalisations and deaths, that governments have overreacted. Hanson wants a royal commission into the Covid response (so far so good, more scrutiny couldn’t hurt given the stonewalling of the Senate Covid committee) … because, she says, Australians have been “lied to” about the number of Covid deaths. Oh dear. The United Australia party leader, former Liberal MP Craig Kelly, was serving Drain the Swamp vibes with his promise to “clean out” government bureaucracies within 24 hours of election. Then he demanded a bill of rights to stop “tinpot dictators, the premiers, egged on by the PM” from ever taking away freedom again. The Nationals MP George Christensen, who earned a rare rebuke from Morrison this week for his advocacy against giving children Covid-19 vaccines, promised he would continue to “prod the powerful” after he leaves parliament at the next election. “I’m not leaving politics … we’re all involved in politics as citizens. I’m going to be in the fray. I was a journalist before I was in politics … I’ll probably step back into that in the future, in some way, shape or form.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The fearmongering and exaggerations about life-saving vaccines piled up. Christensen cited “anecdotal but not verified” reports of adverse events in children in Australia before arguing that “one death” from vaccines is too many because “healthy children don’t die of Covid-19”, it’s more like a case of the “sniffles”. Roberts said people were being injected with vaccines that “can kill them and [are] killing them”. This is despite just 11 deaths linked to Covid-19 vaccines in Australia after 46.1m doses which, along with lockdowns, have given us one of the lowest death rates from Covid in the world. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan was a relative voice of reason, noting he had received the vaccine and it had helped reduce hospitalisations and deaths. He took aim at Labor for labelling him an anti-vaxxer “for the crime of standing up for others’ rights to work”.

Antic accused the “mainstream media” of not telling the truth about the Covid pandemic, arguing it was important to develop new platforms to communicate with supporters. Pat Mesiti, the former Hillsong preacher who organised the event, noted it was supposed to be going live on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram Live. Instagram Live wouldn’t start the broadcast and Facebook shut it down mid-stream. Christensen said this reinforced the need for supporters to follow him on Gab, Parler and Telegram, and for parliament to support his private member’s bill against de-platforming. Kelly had come fresh from the parliamentary inquiry into social media which he has used to take Google and Facebook to task over the removal of his party’s videos from YouTube and his ban from Facebook for pushing unproven treatments for Covid-19. For one section of voters, the election promises to be a contest of narrowcast views about their greatest fears of pandemic politics and continued loss of freedom. But when parliament resumes, the Star Wars Cantina bar of characters will share a stage with Morrison, and he’ll have to answer for their views and the long stretches of inaction against them.",News/Australia news,Prayer and Pushback event gives a taste of the fearmongering to come when federal parliament resumes | Paul Karp,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/prayer-and-pushback-event-gives-a-taste-of-the-fearmongering-to-come-when-federal-parliament-resumes
1/21/2022,"TikTok wrote to Australian political parties in November last year warning them against attempting to pay influencers or engage in any other sort of advertising on its platform, Guardian Australia can reveal. Just months out from the next federal election, the letters were sent after Crikey reported a US-based marketing agency had emailed a campaign brief to a TikTok user offering $300 for the user to make and post a video on the theme of “Scott Morrison is too slow and always late”.  When the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was asked on Thursday about the November report, he told radio station 6PR he wasn’t familiar with it. “Well, it is the first I’ve heard of it. But it wouldn’t be too hard for people to post TikTok videos along that theme. Because that is a theme that is characterised by this government. That is what we hear back,” he said. He argued politicians wouldn’t need to pay people to post that kind of content. “You don’t need any incentive to encourage people to put things on social media of a partisan nature against the PM, against me, against Clive Palmer, against anyone. That’s one of the facts of what happens with social media.” While politicians are allowed to use TikTok, they are not allowed to advertise on the platform under TikTok’s branded content policy. Unlike other platforms such as Facebook, YouTube or Twitter, TikTok does not allow advertising for political content. “Our advertising policies are strict. On TikTok in Australia, we do not allow ads for alcohol, gambling or political parties and causes,” Brent Thomas, TikTok’s director of public policy in Australia and New Zealand, told a parliamentary committee on social media and online safety on Thursday. This policy was questioned at the hearing by United Australia Party leader, Craig Kelly, whose party has been spending millions in advertising on other platforms. Thomas replied that TikTok is primarily an entertainment platform, and while political commentary is allowed, political advertising is not. “We want to make sure that as long as the content that is uploaded adheres to our community guidelines, it’s absolutely OK. But where it is a paid political advertising component? That’s where we draw the line.” “So I could advertise McDonald’s, but I couldn’t advertise the Republican party in the US?” Kelly asked. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Our advertising policies are transparently explained and there are a number of different aspects … which we don’t allow advertising for; that includes alcohol, gambling, weight loss programs and supplements and political advertising,” Thomas replied. TikTok has invited the committee to the company’s transparency centre to get an understanding of how the platform recommends videos to users. However, deputy chair of the committee, Tim Watts, called on the company to provide reports on what videos are getting the most engagement in Australia, similar to the reports available through CrowdTangle about Facebook. People who accept money for advertising political parties in any media in Australia without adequate disclosure or political authorisation can be fined up to $26,640 by the Australian Electoral Commission.",News/Australia news,TikTok warned Australian political parties against advertising on its platform,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/tiktok-warned-australian-political-parties-against-advertising-on-its-platform
1/21/2022,"Happy Friday morning to you all, Graham Russell here to bring you a selection of today’s news and other treats.  The row over allegations that Tory whips threatened rebel MPs to secure their support looks set to continue apace after Labour called for an investigation and a report that some rebels were considering releasing texts or recordings of their conversations. The Guardian has been told of at least five MPs who have expressed concerns about the government threatening funding for their constituency or encouraging damaging stories to be published in newspapers. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the alleged threats to force support for Boris Johnson were “disgusting” and Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said Johnson was “now in full scorched earth mode”. Johnson has said he had “seen no evidence” of threats, and a No 10 spokesperson said: “If there is any evidence to support these claims, we would look at it very carefully.” Allies of Johnson believe a no-confidence vote after the forthcoming release of Sue Gray’s report on the “partygate” scandal is now almost inevitable, though some are increasingly confident he will survive it. One cabinet minister said: “When you start to put it to people that the prime minister who got us this huge majority might have to go over cheese and wine – well it starts to look ridiculous.” Liz Truss, a potential leadership contender who is in Sydney to promote defence ties, said overnight that Johnson had her “100% support”, though she sidestepped a question about whether she would stand in any leadership contest. Amid the continuing speculation, our political correspondent Peter Walker has put together a handy guide to the competing, but sometimes cooperating, factions inside the Tory party. And sketch writer John Crace homes in on the baby-faced assassin who has Johnson in his sights. Private concern – More than 300 NHS consultants have shares in profit-making joint ventures with private healthcare firms, sparking concern that the financial incentives they create could lead to potential conflicts of interest. The thinktank that gathered the data, the Centre for Health and the Public Interest, found no evidence of wrongdoing but urged regulators to investigate the often opaque arrangements, saying the pandemic has “turbo charged” the share of NHS budgets spent in private clinics. The arrangements have generated more than £1bn in revenues since 2015, it has emerged. Ukraine warning – Liz Truss has invoked the Soviet-Afghan war and conflict in Chechnya to warn Russia that any invasion of Ukraine would only lead to “a terrible quagmire and loss of life”. The foreign secretary urged Vladimir Putin to “desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake”. Her comments come after the US accused Russian intelligence of recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to take over the government and cooperate with a Russian occupying force. ‘Shameful shambles’ – The state pension payment system “is not fit for purpose”, a committee of MPs has said in a scathing report, after it emerged that it had underpaid an estimated 134,000 pensioners, mostly women, a total of more than £1bn. The public accounts committee lambasted the Department for Work and Pensions for its “complacency” and accused it of not having been “sufficiently transparent” to parliament about the problems. In February 2021 the Guardian featured the case of Angela Jenner, now 79, who was getting only 86p a week as her state pension but, after making a claim, saw this increased to £80.45 a week, and also learned she was owed £42,700. ‘I’m gutted’ – Adele has postponed her three-month residency in Las Vegas, which was due to start today, saying the production has been “absolutely destroyed” by Covid-related delays. Clearly upset, she apologised profusely in an Instagram video to fans who had already made the trip to see her. The residency, titled Weekends with Adele, was intended to celebrate her highly lauded album 30, which topped music charts in the UK, Australia and the US. “I’m gutted and I’m sorry it’s so last minute,” Adele said. “We’ve been awake for over 30 hours now and we’ve run out of time.” Denied a platform – Transport secretary Grant Shapps has called for unnecessary train announcements to be cut as part of a “bonfire of the banalities”. Announcements that could be culled as part of a review include instructions to have your ticket ready when leaving the station, as well as calls to keep the volume down in quiet carriages. Limits for the frequency of announcements will also be set. The latest skirmish between the BBC and the government is part of a running debate over who the BBC serves, which dates back to the organisation’s earliest days. But this time, the stakes are higher.

Interfaith marriages have always carried a social stigma but, in recent years, since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party came to power, such unions have become a dangerous flashpoint due to a discredited but pervasive conspiracy known as “love jihad”. Liverpool surged into the final of the Carabao Cup and will face Chelsea at Wembley next month after a brace from Diogo Jota put paid to Arsenal. Jürgen Klopp hailed Jota as “world-class” as the club seeks to win the trophy for a record ninth time. The final isn’t for over a month, so here are 10 things to look out for this weekend. Former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka has become the first player through to the last 16 of the Australian Open after despatching 15th seed Elina Svitolina 6-0, 6-2 on Friday, keeping alive her hopes of winning a third title at Melbourne Park. Current No 1 Ash Barty and Naomi Osaka play their third-round matches later, while Rafael Nadal headlines the evening session in the men’s draw. Thursday was a day of disappointment for the UK, with losses for Emma Raducanu and Andy Murray – here’s what they had to say. Tahlia McGrath, the 26-year-old all-rounder who has displaced Ellyse Perry in the Australian lineup, has guided her side to a nine-wicket victory in the opening encounter of the Women’s Ashes. On Thursday she cemented her status as one of the world’s premier all-rounders, with an unbeaten 91 off 49 balls and a return of three for 26 with the ball. “Something just clicked tonight,” she said. In rugby, Henry Slade appears likely to take part in England’s entire Six Nations campaign after he was declared available for Exeter’s trip to Montpellier this weekend. Slade was among England’s best performers in the autumn. There were fears the away matches against Italy and France could prove tricky for Slade, who has previously expressed hesitancy over coronavirus vaccines, but Exeter chief Rob Baxter has hinted the 28-year-old centre is now fully jabbed. Britain’s wind and solar farms might pay back almost £800m to consumers by the end of the winter after gas and electricity market prices rocketed above their set subsidy levels. The move could help reduce household power bills by £27 a year, but that could have been a lot more if the renewable energy rollout had taken place sooner, the industry has said. The government is to invest £100m to help Britishvolt build Britain’s first large-scale “gigafactory” in north-east England. The company is hoping to build the plant rapidly with the aim of supplying a large part of the UK car industry’s needs. In China, Evergrande’s finance woes continue, with news that bondholders have hired a law firm and threatened action after receiving “little more than vague assurances of intent” from the property developer. The pound is buying $1.359 and €1.200 at time of writing. The alleged intimidation of some Tory MPs is covered by several of today’s papers. The Guardian says “Tories ‘using dirty tactics to get MPs to back Johnson”, focusing on Christian Wakeford saying he was told he would not get a school for Radcliffe if he “did not vote in one particular way”. The main picture shows a bevy of commuters as the return to the office looms large. The i says “Tory civil war over future of Johnson” and carries its own polling showing 71% of the public believe the prime minister will not make it to the next election. The Mirror focuses on Wakeford’s claim, alongside the headline “lowest of the low”, while the Metro says “Blackmailed to back Boris”. The Times looks ahead with a report that some Tory rebels are considering publishing exchanges they have had with the whips to back claims of threats. “Tory rebels retaliate in row over ‘blackmail’” is the headline. Also, a very large picture shows the Duchess of Cambridge clearly enjoying holding a cockapoo. Others look to Covid-related stories. The Telegraph says “Schools defy PM over masks in class” alongside an image of a dejected Emma Raducanu after her Australian Open exit. Columnist Fraser Nelson’s view, that “Boris deserves one last chance”, features across the top. The Mail focuses on union anger at Johnson’s efforts to get civil servants back at their desks as an example of the return-to-the-office ethos. The Express reports millions could be in line for help with their fuel bills under a “radical idea” being considered by Rishi Sunak. The FT looks further afield, with the headline: “Biden hardens warning to Russia after Kyiv says no attack is minor”.

1/21/2022,"Emergency, a comedy thriller about three college friends – two Black, one Latino – navigating a downpour of bad optics and decisions, traffics in several established lanes: the raucous one-last-epic-party romp a la Booksmart, where everything that can escalate will in the course of a single night; the hijinks-filled buddy road trip comedy albeit this time around campus; and the socially aware thriller in the shadow of Get Out, where every move is weighted by the looming threat of anti-Black racism in America. In other words, a ride somehow both warm and stressful, and an inviting mashup of familiar beats made fresh by a trio of grounded, endearing performances.  The film, adapted from the 2018 Sundance short by screenwriter KD Dávila and director Carey Williams with distribution by Amazon, opens in party comedy mode: best friends Kunle (Donald Elise Watkins) and Sean (RJ Cyler) determined to become the first Black students at fictional Buchanan College to complete a “legendary tour” of exclusive frat parties. The two are a classic yin-yang: Kunle the strait-laced and straight-A striver studying biology (the “Barack Obama of fungus”, Sean ribs), Sean the laid-back stoner with zero future plan but a tight party schedule. They’re also minority students in a mostly white space. Dávila has a sharp ear for the self-aggrandizing paternalism of liberal arts colleges – in the opening minutes, a white British professor of “blasphemy and taboos” repeats the N-word in class and dials in on Kunle and Sean for their response in a “safe space”; after class, a white classmate offers to take up their “cause” at student council. But where some campus films could turn didactic, Emergency smartly sticks to the bristled, deep friendship behind the partying: an aimless Sean wants to make his mark on Buchanan before he leaves, and Kunle, secretly considering a PhD at Princeton that would separate them, doesn’t want to disappoint Sean. When the two return home to pre-game and find a white girl (Maddie Nichols) passed out facedown in their living room, Kunle, the voice of reason, suggests they call 911. Sean, stoned and buzzed, balks at calling authorities. Two Black guys and their stoner Mexican-American roommate Carlos (Sebastian Chacon) with an unconscious blonde girl in a house that reeks of weed? What are the odds they’ll be believed? The specter of police misreading a situation to potentially dangerous ends is a Chekhov’s gun – the more strenuously the trio tries to avoid it through increasingly paranoid but well-intentioned means, the more they court suspicion and reason to find themselves apprehended by officers likely to afford them the least possible generosity. Compounding the risk is Maddy (Sabrina Carpenter), a ticking timebomb of concern, self-absorption and explosive indignation, looking for her lost sister Emma with friend Alice (Madison Thompson), who is white, and Alice’s white-passing party crush (Diego Abraham) succinctly described as “from my Arab-Israeli conflict seminar!” Dávila’s script and Williams’s tight direction deftly render the group as both a lifeline on a collision course with the boys, and a trap – their concern is legitimate, their biases dangerous. By the film’s midpoint, the accumulation of miscommunications, wrong place wrong time coincidences, and simply idiotic decisions begins to wear; Emergency is a comedy of errors whose steep price never escapes awareness, including that Emma clearly needs help, and at a certain point I found myself silently pleading with Sean, Kunle and Carlos to just call for help already. But thanks to standout lead performances, you can never fully blame one character for holding out on sense for plot’s sake. Cyler, as Sean, embodies a different type of American Blackness than Kunle, the son of immigrant doctors dressed somewhere between country club and substitute teacher. Sean is full Gen Z, slang-inflected speech and vape in hand, and Cyler plays his pitched, paranoid awareness of the racial sinkholes in every situation as a bruise clearly formed by personal experience. A lesser film would have careened into the sensational or bluntly traumatic as the plot steps on the gas and both the optics and Emma’s prognosis worsen, but Emergency sticks the landing. Like Get Out, it relies more on the specter of anti-Black policing than actual violence; simply visualizing a potential tragedy, understanding its possibility, is enough. There’s still catastrophe. In the film’s climax, Williams assumes Kunle’s perspective for a gut-punch, slow-motion shattering of innocence. Watkins is excellent at conveying the nuclear fallout of Kunle’s disillusionment; in a standout conclusion, Williams hovers the camera on his face, and the waves of emotional devastation – humiliation, shock, fear, disappointment at the futility of truth against decades of biases – are their own kind of searing death. But darkness and light go hand in hand in Emergency, which also features one of the sweetest straight male friendship heart-to-hearts I’ve seen on screen in awhile. Emergency toggles between styles, from playful to suspenseful and back, but Kunle and Sean remain consistent anchors throughout, as two young men carrying the weight of prejudices but buoyed up by a different inescapable, mutable force: a best friendship in flux but in no need of a 911 call. Emergency is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be released on Amazon later this year",Arts/Film,Emergency review – endearing yet stressful contemporary campus caper,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/20/emergency-review-endearing-yet-stressful-contemporary-campus-caper
1/21/2022,"Members of a cross-party China human rights group have accused Britain’s cybersecurity agency of “failing to respond” with help after their website was taken offline this week in an attack they fear came from Beijing. MPs from the Inter Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac) said the incident took place on Tuesday, days after the group had said publicly it was “deeply disturbed” by reports that an Anglo-Chinese lawyer had been trying to improperly influence parliamentarians in the UK.  They complained the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) did not engage or show interest in investigating the episode, the second time in under a year the website of the campaign group of international parliamentarians had been knocked out. Conservative MP Tim Loughton said: “It is unacceptable that the NCSC is failing to respond to reports of suspected cyber-attacks from Chinese state backed actors. The British government must be doing its utmost to protect parliamentarians and activists working on these issues from further attacks and intimidation.” Ipac’s website was taken offline for three hours by a denial of service attack – where a host is flooded with requests and can no longer function. But without any help from NCSC, Ipac will not be able determine who was behind it. Labour’s Afzal Khan said: “In light of the cyber-attack and last week’s events, it is clear that this government must act to ensure its cybersecurity is up to scratch. The government cannot ignore those at the sharp end of the Chinese Communist party’s intimidation campaign.” NCSC said it was aware of the denial of service attack, and had made contact with Ipac. As far it was aware the issue had been resolved. A spokesperson added that “Ipac have not directly raised any concerns about the NCSC’s response to this issue but we would welcome any further engagement with them.” Last week, MI5 took the rare step of issuing an “interference alert” to MPs and peers, in which the spy agency accused a lawyer, Christine Lee, of seeking to improperly influence parliamentarians on behalf of China’s ruling Communist party. Lee had been photographed meeting former prime minister David Cameron in 2015 and had given £584,177 to help fund the office of Labour MP and former shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner. Members of Ipac include legislators from the US, India, Japan, France and the UK, and the group aims to encourage democratic countries to give “due prominence to universal human rights” in their dealings with China – and to insist that Beijing hold to the “standards of the international legal order”. Beijing has responded with hostility. Five British members of the group and several more from the EU have been sanctioned by Beijing for speaking out about the treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority, including Loughton and Labour peer Helena Kennedy. Last October, Ipac held a meeting on the margins of the G20 summit in Rome to protest against the presence of the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, and urge leaders not to let China off the hook over human rights abuses in return for cooperation on the climate crisis. China normally denies allegations of hacking or cyber interference, accusing the US and its allies of engaging in smear campaigns, although the topic is a subject of growing diplomatic and intelligence agency concern in the west.",News/World news,MPs criticise cyber agency for not aiding China rights group after it was hacked,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/mps-criticise-cyber-agency-for-not-aiding-china-rights-group-after-it-was-hacked
1/21/2022,"Only two of the government briefings held at the height of the coronavirus pandemic were led by a female politician, and in both cases it was the home secretary, Priti Patel, a report into gender representation across the UK’s top jobs has shows. The 2022 Sex and Power Index, compiled by the Fawcett Society, a charity campaigning for women’s rights, showed equality is still “decades off”, as men continue to dominate the top ranks of law, politics and business.  The biennial report also highlighted the complete lack of women of colour in senior roles and what it lamented as a “glacial” pace of change. Women account for just 8% of FTSE 100 CEOs, none of whom is a woman of colour. Jemima Olchawski, CEO of the Fawcett Society, said: “The pandemic has laid bare deep-rooted inequalities across the UK. Yet it is women who have borne the brunt and often largely invisible from debate and excluded from decision-making.” Of the 56 daily press conferences, when the government makes significant announcements about coronavirus, 43% featured an all-male lineup with no female politician or expert present, the index showed. Only a third (92 of the 274) of members on Covid-19 advisory boards are women. Research by Kings College also found female voices to be missing from public debate. Its analysis showed that women made up only a fifth of the top 20 most frequently mentioned British politicians in media coverage of the pandemic. Nevertheless, in journalism, the proportion of women editing national newspapers has doubled from last year to 42%. While the gender split in parliament has barely progressed – the proportion of female MPs inched from 32% in 2017 to 34% at the 2019 election – outside Westminster, there have been “seismic shifts” towards equality. In Scottish parliament, women now make up just under half of MSPs under the leader, Nicola Sturgeon. At the May 2021 election, Kaukab Stewart became the first woman of colour elected to the Scottish parliament, and Pam Gosal was elected as the first Sikh MSP. The six minority ethnic MSPs make up 4.5% of the Scottish parliament, which is in line with the percentage of minority ethnic people in the country’s population. “Men continue to dominate most senior roles,” Olchawski said. “That’s not only bad for the women who miss out on opportunities to thrive, but it’s bad for us all, as we miss out on women’s talent, skills and perspectives. “What is most alarming about today’s data is that it shows an unacceptable lack of women of colour in senior positions. It is appalling that in 2022, women of colour are missing in leadership positions from some of our key institutions and organisations.” Women are outnumbered 2:1 in the 5,166 positions of power in society. Only two justices on the 12-member supreme court are women, and no person of colour has ever taken up the role. The next tier down is more representative – a quarter of the 37 court of appeal judges are women. “Put simply, this gives the lie to the idea that we live in a meritocracy or a society of equal opportunity,” Olchawski said. “Structures, culture and often individuals continue to create barriers that prevent women and women of colour in particular rising to the top.” Responding to the findings, the Fawcett Society called on the government to set targets to increase the number of women in senior roles and improve pay gap reporting, including reducing the threshold for reporting to employers with 100+ employees, and publication of mandatory action plans.",News/World news,"Only two UK Covid briefings were led by a female MP, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/only-two-uk-covid-briefings-female-mp-2022-sex-and-power-index

The flight took off on 13 January from the Mojave Air and Space Port, California, at 1339 PST (0939 GMT).

Once the aircraft, named Cosmic Girl, was in position and final checks were complete, the rocket was released from the wing. Five seconds later, it ignited and climbed out of the Earth’s atmosphere. About 55 minutes later, the seven small satellites in its nose cone were deployed into orbits approximately 310 miles in altitude and inclined to the equator by 45 degrees.  The satellites are mostly experimental devices to test novel communication, navigation and propulsion techniques, detect space debris and monitor agriculture on the Earth. Four have been flown as part of the US military’s Space Test Program. The other three are from commercial enterprises. In light of this success, Virgin Orbit plans five more launches this year, including two in summer that will take off from Newquay airport in Cornwall, England.",News/Science,Virgin Orbit California rocket launch paves way for UK lift-off,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/21/virgin-orbit-california-rocket-launch-paves-way-for-uk-lift-off
1/21/2022,"Train announcements are to be given a formal hearing by government officials so that those deemed “repetitive and unnecessary” can be axed. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has commissioned a cross-industry review and called for a “bonfire of the banalities”.  Announcements that are tipped to fall foul of Shapps’s cull include instructions to passengers to have their ticket ready when leaving the station, as well as public address calls to keep the volume down in designated quiet carriages. Limits for the frequency of announcements will also be set. Shapps said: “Train passengers are all too often plagued by an endless torrent of repeated and unnecessary announcements. “That’s why I’m calling for a bonfire of the banalities to bring down the number of announcements passengers are forced to sit through and make their journey that little bit more peaceful.” The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would ensure passengers continue to receive important information, and officials making the changes would work with accessibility groups. However, early indications are that some of the biggest bugbears will remain, if they are deemed to play a “safety critical role”. That could include “See it. Say it. Sorted”, widely regarded as one of the most irritating announcements, but commissioned and launched by rail ministers in conjunction with British Transport Police in 2016. The DfT said the move to control onboard announcements was part of the Williams-Shapps plan to improve the rail industry for passengers – although review chair Keith Williams also found that railways were bedevilled by government micromanagement. Jacqueline Starr, of the Rail Delivery Group, representing operators, said: “We know people want the most relevant and timely messages on their journeys and to help with this, train operators are continuing their work to improve customer information, including cutting unnecessary onboard announcements.” Labour said the move showed Shapps was out of touch with priorities. Louise Haigh, shadow transport secretary, said: “Tannoys aren’t the only thing that have fallen silent – ministers have literally nothing to say about the Conservatives’ cost of living crisis facing passengers as they hike up rail fares this year. “What hard-pressed passengers want to hear more than anything else is a plan to help them.” Meanwhile the RMT union questioned the need for the review. A spokesman said: “The last thing we get is passengers complaining they have too much information. “You do need to be careful about assuming everyone’s heard it all before. We’d be deeply concerned if this was another ruse to remove staff from trains as part of the government’s wider cuts agenda.”",News/UK news,‘Endless torrent’ of announcements on UK railways to be sharply reduced,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/21/endless-torrent-of-announcements-on-uk-railways-to-be-sharply-reduced
1/21/2022,"The first few minutes of As We See It (Amazon Prime) show a remarkable demonstration of how auditory processing can be difficult for some people on the autism spectrum. Harrison, a man in his 20s, is carefully coaxed out of his Los Angeles apartment by his live-in aide, Mandy. She calls him on his phone, so that she can talk him through his walk around the block, and slowly, carefully, he begins. Traffic might be a little loud, she warns him. He worries that a woman with a crying baby is looking at him. With each step, Mandy reassures him that it’s fine. And then a dog appears, starts barking, and chaos ensues. Harrison flees back indoors. Each noise and potential trigger is cleverly pushed in the mix, to give viewers who may not understand Harrison’s fears a chance to experience them. This new drama follows three roommates on the spectrum, all played by actors who are on the spectrum themselves. Their families pay Mandy (Sosie Bacon, last seen as the mother of Kate Winslet’s grandson in Mare of Easttown) a salary to live in as their support worker. Harrison barely leaves the flat, while Jack has a job as a programmer, and Violet works at a fast-food restaurant (it’s a real chain, and it gets a lot of mentions). All three are living with Mandy in order to work towards greater independence, and all have goals they are supposed to achieve each week, whether that is making new friends, or asking how a relative is feeling about a difficult emotional situation.  This is a well-done, soapy drama that has its heart fully on display. Based on an Israeli series, On the Spectrum, it was developed, produced and partly written by the writer of American football drama Friday Night Lights, Jason Katims, whose son is autistic, and the passion behind the project is evident. It is very sweet. Mandy loves her roommates, so much so that her re-application to medical school is forcing her to question her priorities. Should she pursue her dreams, or is she happier where she is? Will she follow her boyfriend to university, or will she find love in closer quarters? There’s certainly a spark between her and Violet’s harried brother Van. But its warmth is part of a far more complex picture, and this is careful to strike a balance between its more saccharine instincts and what its three leads have to navigate on a daily basis. Harrison begins to make friends with a young boy living upstairs; the boy’s mother sees this in an understandable, but inaccurate, light. Jack is anxious and blunt with his assessments of certain situations, telling his boss that he believes him to be of inferior intelligence when asked to redo his work. And Violet wants a boyfriend, as she tells Van, in great detail, but her literal-minded approach to finding love leads her into scrape after scrape. The only solace in one episode comes from a robotic vacuum cleaner. It makes the point, again and again, that the world is not always built for people on the autism spectrum, and that sometimes life will be tough. People are often cruel, both deliberately and inadvertently. One of its most important scenes, I think, shows Van losing his patience with his sister, whom he loves very much, berating her for not being “normal”. He immediately regrets it, of course, but it shows that this is not just pushing a simple idea of what it would take for that situation to change. Netflix’s comedy Atypical recently came to an end after a charming run, Love on the Spectrum was a lovely look at dating with autism, but it feels like the perfect time for a drama like this to come along. (It appears to be billed as a comedy on Amazon, but, based on the first three episodes, I’m not sure that sets a fair expectation.) Yes, it can be a little sweet at times, but it is so generous and genuine that it is hard to judge it for that.

1/21/2022,"In January 2021, as London buckled under the weight of treating thousands of Covid patients, the medical directors of the main NHS hospitals wrote to their medical consultants, pleading with them to stop doing non-urgent private work and to turn their attention to high-priority NHS cases. Under the 2003 NHS consultant contract, there should have been no reason to issue such a plea. NHS consultants can only do paid work in the private sector with the permission of their NHS employer and only if it does not cause a detriment to NHS care.  In doing so, the medical directors publicly acknowledged something many people have long suspected, namely that the lure of highly lucrative private work, particularly in large cities, can pull a sizeable number of NHS consultants away to focus on those who are prepared to pay. As NHS waiting lists have soared during the pandemic, so has the demand for fee-paying private work, with waiting lists for treatment now also occurring in the private sector, a further pull on the loyalties of NHS medical consultants. In 2021, for the first time since 1948, more orthopaedic activity – such as hip replacements – took place in private hospitals than in the NHS. This fact can only mean that last year a significant number of consultants were doing more hip and knee replacements privately than for their NHS employers, sincethere is only one pool of (mainly) NHS consultants to treat both NHS and private patients. It also means that since the pandemic hit, access to certain operations is being determined not by need, but ability to pay. The private hospital companies have for many years clocked the need to keep NHS consultants close to them, showering them with lavish corporate hospitality and offering them financial incentives, such as share ownership schemes and jointventures to encourage them to do work in their hospitals. Under such schemes the more private work they do, the more the business benefits and the greater the dividend pot which the consultants can draw from. Similar schemes are also in operation in the more controversial area of private cancer care. The current strategy of many of the healthcare multinationals operating in the UK is to exploit the dire state of NHS cancer services and to use financial incentives to lock in NHS consultants to do work for them. It is a strategy that is succeeding – in 2017 cancer care became the biggest earner for private hospitals in London for the first time.Yet the growing role of for-profit cancer care in the UK is something parliament and the public are yet to engage with. As cancer treatment is given to patients who are often very vulnerable, the existence of the profit motive in this form of care requires a robust system of regulation to protect patients from harm. The very worst form of abuse happened in for-profit cancer care when the now jailed breast surgeon Ian Paterson deliberately misdiagnosed cancer in hundreds, potentially thousands of mainly female patients and as a result carried out mastectomies and other surgery for financial gain. However, to date, the government has made only the very scantest of efforts to reform private healthcare in the light of this scandal by failing to act on the Paterson inquiry recommendations. That NHS consultants are benefiting financially from the demand for private treatment caused by the pandemic is a highly sensitive issue the medical profession too often dodges. But the backlog of NHS care can only be addressed if NHS consultants are compelled to give priority to NHS patients and if the financial incentives used by multinationals to encourage them to do private work are fully disclosed with any potential conflicts of interests affecting patient care firmly prohibited.

Hollie Richardson Chosen by Elena Morresi In the pilot of their podcast, Lacey and Flynn talk about creating something new, not porn or sex education. ‘Porncation’ is the neologism they land on while they record themselves having sex in their living room. At the start of episode 17, Lacey gives a trigger warning, and after listening and skimming through all 38 episodes of the podcast so far, I wish it had come earlier. Lacey and Flynn Have Sex is about heteronormative sex. They speak of feminine and masculine energy, caveating that this is not gender based. In this relationship, though, it does appears to be. Lacey, the cis-female in the marriage, shames herself for not matching her husband’s libido; “poor you” she says at one point, when discussing turning her husband’s advances down, and cis-male Flynn accepts his heroism in standing by her while missing out on orgasms across their 10 year relationship. This red flag has dragged the podcast to the bottom of my listening list. But here are some other observations: the podcast can be cringey with new-age rhetoric and challenges to modern medicine, it is peppered with adverts promoting their pay-to-attend courses, the audio quality is perfect, and let’s face it, sex sells. Normalising sex is healthy, and Lacey and Flynn’s teachings definitely entice many listeners and probably de-stigmatise talking about sex. But before you delve in, approach with caution, fact check, and heed my trigger warning. Who says that being a librarian isn’t a cutting-edge, tech-focused job of the future?

1/21/2022,"Hundreds of NHS consultants are shareholders in profit-making joint ventures with private healthcare firms, in arrangements that have generated more than £1bn in revenues since 2015, it has emerged. The Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI), an independent thinktank, has identified 481 consultants in England with shares in 34 private ventures set up in partnership with providers ranging from the huge US healthcare firm HCA to Specsavers opticians. The vast majority of these consultants – 73% – are NHS doctors.  In a report published on Thursday, CHPI claimed the arrangements were often opaque, and that the financial incentives created by these joint ventures could lead to conflicts of interest. It is calling on regulators to investigate, saying the Covid-19 pandemic has “turbo charged” the share of NHS budgets spent in private clinics. “The large number of consultants who own shares in private hospitals through joint venture arrangements and the very large financial benefit which they derive from these arrangements is a significant matter of public interest,” said David Rowland, CHPI director. The report found no evidence of wrongdoing, and there were no instances of patients being put at risk. But Rowland said lack of scrutiny and public understanding of these arrangements meant there was “potential for abuses to occur”. Between 2015 and 2020, the last full year for which accounts are available, joint ventures with consultants generated nearly £260m in operating profits. While the majority of this cash went to the private firms, consultant shareholders extracted an estimated £31m in dividends, CHPI said. The average dividend was £11,600 a year, but the highest earning consultants were estimated to have received £172,000 a year. These dividends were paid on top of any fees for treating private patients and NHS salaries. Some consultants received no dividends, but CHPI said this was because many of the joint ventures were less than three years old and do not yet pay out to shareholders. The number of joint ventures is increasing, as more private healthcare companies enter the UK market. The fast-growing Australian firm GenesisCare, which specialises in cancer clinics, has set up three joint ventures with 41 consultants. Genesis is owned by investors including the US private equity firm KKR and the Chinese state conglomerate China Resources. “The effect of joint ventures could be to pull consultants away from NHS work,” said Rowland. “There’s a finite pool of consultants to do all the hip operations, all the cancer care, there isn’t another pool out there that comes with the private sector. “By virtue of doing more private care at the expense of doing NHS care, you drive up waiting lists and the consequence is that you create more demand for private care. It’s a negative loop from the perspective of the patient and the NHS, it’s a profitable, positive loop from the perspective of the companies and the consultants.” Delays in NHS treatment have hit record levels during the pandemic, with 6 million people in England now waiting for routine hospital treatment. Many NHS trusts are turning to the private sector to help bring down waiting lists, and private hospitals are increasingly looking to pick up NHS work. “The Covid pandemic has ‘turbo charged’ these strategies,” the report claimed. Private hospitals received more than £2bn from the NHS in the year to March 2021, as ministers encouraged the use of private facilities. Up to £10bn has been earmarked for the private sector to deliver NHS services over the next four years. CHPI expressed concern about conflicts of interest after finding some NHS trusts paid for services with companies that have joint ventures with their own consultants. The thinktank, which is not politically affiliated, is calling for a regulatory overhaul, with responsibility for policing the financial arrangements of medical consultants handed to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). One of the private healthcare firms that has received NHS cash while running joint ventures with consultants is HCA, which is the largest private provider in the UK. NHS hospitals employ 342 consultants who are members of 15 separate joint ventures with HCA. Those ventures have paid out nearly £26m in dividends to doctors since 2015. After HCA, the group with the second-largest number of joint ventures is the US-owned Aspen Healthcare, which runs private hospitals across the UK. It has five joint ventures, with 51 consultants. Specsavers has established five joint venture arrangements with 18 NHS ophthalmologists through its subsidiary company Newmedica. CHPI compiled the numbers using accounts filed at Companies House by private healthcare providers and the transparency data, which they are required to publish by the Competitions and Markets Authority. The thinktank’s report calls on the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, and NHS England to examine the “full extent” of taxpayer money flowing to consultant joint ventures, and the potential conflicts of interest. A spokesperson for HCA Healthcare UK said: “Our work to support NHS trusts is entirely separate to and independent of any co-investment consultants may have with us in any of our private clinics or practices. Any suggestion that the two are linked is wholly inaccurate and misleading, as is any suggestion that HCA UK incentivises doctors to refer into our hospitals.” They added: “We work with NHS trusts on an individual basis and in response to their requests for support.” All companies named as holding joint ventures with NHS consultants were contacted for comment. Circle Health Group, which acquired BMI Healthcare in early 2020, referred queries to the industry body, while Spire Healthcare declined to comment. An Aspen Healthcare spokesperson said the company complied with the regulations set out by the CQC and the CMA. A spokesperson for the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, an industry body, said: “As CHPI make clear, there is absolutely no evidence that joint ventures put patients at risk or that that any wrongdoing has arisen through joint venture arrangements. Additionally, GMC [General Medical Council] guidance clearly states that healthcare professionals in both the NHS and the independent sector should not allow any financial interests to influence the care they provide to patients.” A spokesperson at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust said: “Consultants with a private practice at the Royal Marsden are required to disclose any conflicts of interest and only refer patients to other providers if there is a clinical need to do so.”",News/Business,Hundreds of England’s NHS consultants have shares in private clinics,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/hundreds-of-englands-nhs-consultants-have-shares-in-private-clinics
1/21/2022,"Former soldier Ben Roberts-Smith has lost a court bid to have his former wife questioned about allegations she accessed his private emails, with a judge ruling his case relied upon “possibilities and suspicions” that were in many cases “ill-founded”. Roberts-Smith was ordered by federal court justice Robert Bromwich to pay the costs of Emma Roberts, his former wife, in Friday’s judgment.  The former special forces soldier had been seeking to have Roberts cross-examined about whether she had accessed emails from a joint account the couple both had access to when they were married. The couple separated in January 2020. Roberts-Smith argued confidential information of his had been obtained by Roberts from the email account and given to media organisations he is suing for defamation in separate court proceedings. In those proceedings, he claims a series of reports published by the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times in 2018 are defamatory because they portray him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes including murder. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied the allegations, saying they were “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. The newspapers are running a truth defence to their reporting. Roberts-Smith had wanted Roberts to be cross-examined about the email address, but also to provide a new affidavit to the court about every person she had given access to the account, and every person to whom she had disclosed the contents of the account. He had also applied to have Danielle Scott, a close friend of Roberts, and Scott’s husband added to the court proceedings. Roberts and Scott are both expected to be called as witnesses by the newspapers in the defamation case. But on Friday, Bromwich ruled that Roberts-Smith had provided little evidence to justify his application. “The material relied upon goes no further than bare possibilities and suspicions, with many such assertions in relation to Ms Roberts being shown to be ill-founded as against her, and equally ill-founded as against Ms Scott,” the judge said. Roberts-Smith said in his affidavit that the email account which was the subject of the court case had been set up in December 2012 to handle paid public speaking engagements through a company known as RS Group. Roberts-Smith, his accountant, and Roberts, as directors of RS Group, all had their own individual email accounts, but also had administrator access that allowed them to read all emails that came to RS Group accounts. Roberts-Smith said in his affidavit that after the publication of the alleged defamatory articles, he no longer received requests for public speaking engagements, but continued to use his personal RS Group email address from the end of 2018 until about 20 April 2021. He said this included corresponding with his legal advisers in relation to the defamation proceedings and the Afghanistan inquiry being conducted by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence force, and corresponding with people from his employer the Seven Network, “all of which was confidential and some of which included legal advice”. But Bromwich said the media outlets in the defamation hearing had not included any material in their case which had come from Roberts, and that the examples Roberts-Smith had provided of correspondence between Roberts and Scott – which he argued indicated the emails had been accessed improperly – were not conclusive. One such 2020 exchange, in which Scott tells Roberts she has found four chapters of a book Roberts-Smith wrote, and a “graphic email” from his ghostwriter, referred not to Scott having access to the email account, Bromwich found, but to her finding copies of emails that Roberts had sent her months previously. “The inference sought to be drawn that this statement was a reference to a privileged document was weak to non-existent, whereas the explanation that Ms Roberts gives is logical and coherent and supported by the terms of the email chains produced which I am satisfied are authentic for the reasons already given,” Bromwich said. “This conclusion also bolsters the reliability of Ms Roberts’ affidavit evidence and correspondingly detracts from the reliability of Mr Roberts-Smith’s affidavit evidence.” Bromwich did find that Roberts had accessed the account on one occasion after they had separated that had not been disclosed in her original affidavit – when she had opened an email sent to Roberts-Smith regarding a purchase he had made with airline loyalty points. Bromwich accepted that she had accessed the account and the email for legitimate reasons, and had been “candid” in disclosing how this occurred and why she shared the contents of the email with Scott. The case is listed to return to court again for a management hearing on 28 January, with the defamation trial, which has been delayed by the pandemic, expected to resume on 2 February.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith loses ‘ill-founded’ court case over ex-wife’s access to joint email account,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/ben-roberts-smith-loses-ill-founded-court-case-over-ex-wifes-access-to-joint-email-account
1/21/2022,"It’s the coldest night of the winter. Just hours ago, the world was agleam with wet cold, now – with the dark – it’s solid cold. Things that rustled now rattle, and the grass is in a beautiful rigour of felty frost. It catches the moonlight and sparkles, a miracle that turns the colourless and drab suddenly starkly beautiful under the light of the dark. Clear winter nights like this are wonderful for stars. That, and to just go out and feel the cold and its tight silence around you. I stand and breathe deep, exhaling stiff, granular steam. And I start to feel it as it works its way in. Fingers, feet, nose. Then deeper, like an alarm of rising volume. Stand still enough for long enough and it takes hold of your core, a sickly pain, that – left long enough – will stop your life.  In my life I’ve been hypothermic, been frostnipped, yet still crave cold places and seasons. I feel the cold more than I used to. I have to walk quicker, and dress thicker, to stave it off. But it’s one of the reasons I love Britain: that I can stand in the same place at the poles of the year breathless with either heat or cold. Stark nights like this scratch any winter blues to raw white, a kind of elemental reset, however modest. There is cold that is invigorating, restoring. Then there is cold that is a warning. Your body keens with it, reeling from an assault it can’t deal with for long. Find shelter. Get warm. It’s an anxious feeling, but a good one. A perspective. Some associate the cold with a sensory numbing; to me it’s the opposite. It’s an affirmation of feeling. The frost is so bright in the moonlight that my eyes can’t adapt for the stars. The ground is shimmering more than the sky, and the cold is becoming enough, now. So I go back across the grass, each blade a sculpture that cracks underfoot. It feels almost wrong to walk on it.
