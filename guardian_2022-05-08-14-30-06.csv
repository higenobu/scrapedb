5/8/2022,"Iwas never much one for potted bulbs. The allotment was for vegetables, and fruits and annual flowers. Our terrace had been a cascade of clematis, climbing roses, jasmines and rhododendron. Walls covered with flowering trellis. A country garden on a small city rooftop. With the arrival of Plot 29, Henri took over at home. Soon gone the tonne of marble pebbles, the failing teak furniture, the almost claustrophobic colour. In came a cleaner, leaner Danish-architect aesthetic. No longer trying to clutter my foster-father’s Devon croft on to a Kentish Town terrace. Sprawling plants and bushes found new homes in Kala’s garden where we can happily still see them. Soon I found a new obsession. Beautiful bulb catalogues, from Bloms Bulbs, from tulip specialist Peter Nyssen, from our favourite Farmer Gracy, sometimes Sarah Raven. Spring impulses in autumn. A delicious anxiety of winter waiting. Mayday lily of the valley came first, because both our mothers loved them. A perennial pot. Plants now also transplanted to the summerhouse. Shyly showing in among the base of the silver birch, settled now, spreading further. But it was in London at first where the spring bulbs took over. Ever more planting. Ever more ambition. Multiple tulips, narcissi, muscari, daffodils. The weeks of scanning bare soil for signs of life. Almost daily, we ask ourselves: ‘Is that a plant tip pushing through?’ Until, at last, it is undeniable. Then came ‘lasagne’ planting, layered multiple bulbs in each pot. Suddenly, you could have it all: early, late, short, tall, tulips, daffodils, many shapes, colours, sizes. The palette widened. We have settled down a little now. This year, four pots. Varieties, styles and colours gradually giving way to each other. I sit with a book, a pot of tea and Henri. The simple landscape subtly changes. Pots are moved up or down. In and out of more prominent positions. Our own small world. In spring. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

5/8/2022,"Short of Will Smith and Chris Rock being drafted in at the last minute, this year’s TV Baftas seem unlikely to generate the same level of controversy as the recent Oscars. Hopefully, this will be an awards ceremony that spotlights something much more important: brilliant TV. The Guardian’s No 1 show of 2021, It’s a Sin, has 11 nominations, followed by seven for black comedy-drama Landscapers and six for Jodie Comer and Stephen Graham’s Help. Hollie Richardson After his less-than-triumphant turn on GB News, it could be argued that Andrew Neil is lucky to get another shot at mainstream TV. However, his reputation as a fierce and forensic interviewer will presumably have saved him from current affairs oblivion. This live politics show promises interviews, analysis, comment and debate. Phil Harrison The biblical branding jars and Helena Bonham Carter’s twee voiceover is more anthropomorphic than Attenborough devotees might expect. But this series exploring Earth’s last few truly wild places is visually stunning enough to make minor quibbles bearable. We begin in Borneo, with an almost infinite variety of monkeys and a few crocodiles, too. Phil Harrison The second-gear sleuther is livened up by the arrival of James D’Arcy as DS Cassian Pewe, a new nemesis for benighted Roy Grace (John Simm). Eventually, the case of a skeleton in a storm drain becomes a neat tale of double-crossing with a cliffhanger ending. Jack Seale Political upheavals all around, national and sexual: with Halifax on the edge of revolution, power couple Anne Lister and Ann Walker combine estates and set up home in Shibden Hall. Plus, a sudden, startling evocation round the dinner table of a St Francis of Assisi speech, now more associated with a certain other iron lady. Ali Catterall In August 2010, 15-year-old Sarah Scazzi went missing from the small town of Avetrana in south-east Italy. Intense media interest in the disappearance reached a dispiriting apex when her mother was informed Scazzi had been murdered while on live TV. This new four-parter re-examines the whole horrific case. Graeme Virtue Django Unchained, 10pm, 5Star Quentin Tarantino’s first western is a very violent, blackly comic tale of slavery and retribution in the pre-American civil war south. Jamie Foxx is a fierce presence as Django, a slave who, after being freed by Christoph Waltz’s German bounty hunter Schultz, joins him in his work and then on a mission to free Django’s wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). However, she is owned by powerful Mississippi plantation owner and committed sadist Calvin Candie (a studiedly melodramatic Leonardo DiCaprio).

5/8/2022,"The question I have recently come to the realisation that I am a deeply jealous person, which is causing me great unhappiness. I am envious of all my friends, my girlfriend, the stream of people I see through my social media and of anyone I deem to even have a modicum of “success” or talent. Any positive attribute I see in someone else becomes an attribute I don’t possess and therefore a negative mark on my scorecard. My days are spent comparing myself and my work to anyone else I come across, to work out if I am more “successful” or having a better time. I can’t go down the street without seeing people who are far more talented than I am, artworks that I will never be able to create or skills that I will never be able to master. I spend my whole time obsessing over how my own work is not as good as anyone else’s. I work as a freelance in a creative industry. And everyone’s work is out there for comparison. This has led to spiralling low moods and depression. How do I kill the green-eyed monster? Philippa’s answer You cannot kill the green-eyed monster, but you can reframe it. Separate envy from jealousy. Think of jealousy as being more like when you don’t want to share your mum with a sibling, or wish evil upon those you see as your rivals. And envy as being like when someone has something that you want. Instead of thinking of this as a bad thing, think of it as information. It is alerting you to what you want. It can be hard to work out what we do want in life and envy is a feeling that can help us identify what our aspirations might be. Think of envy as a catalyst that helps you identify and motivate ambition, not as a pathological condition, but a normal part of mental processing. You are not your thoughts, you are the observer of them: begin to identify more with the observer part of you than the part thinking these thoughts. Practise this. And until you have more control over your mind by this practice, delete social media from your phone. At the moment, you are seeing someone else’s success personally, as though it reflects on you and isn’t just to do with them. You see their external successes and compare that to your own internal feelings of inadequacy. In other words, you are comparing people’s external appearance to your inner world. Learn more about other’s inner worlds. Talk about envy with your girlfriend, your friends. Learn how they experience it, too. The more you keep these envious feelings to yourself, the more power they will have over you. If you were you, looking at you from the outside, what would you be envious of? The only person you need to compare yourself with is you. What can I do better today than I did yesterday? Break down your goals into the smallest steps possible. Other people will always be more talented than us: learn from and work with them, rather than seeing them as rivals or potential sources of pain. If someone has a quality you feel is not even in your nature to acquire, why not join forces with such a person? It’s why we work in teams – we all have different qualities to bring to the solving of problems. Don’t believe you must do everything on your own. I wonder, when growing up, whether you were in the habit of viewing yourself as inferior or superior to a sibling. That may have become something of a blueprint for living for you. If so you might now be transposing this on to all your relationships. It’s only a formed habit. You can form new habits. When you find yourself in a spiral of depressing comparisons, bring yourself into the present moment by concentrating on your breath until that spiral goes into the background. The symbols of status we hang on to are not universally acknowledged. It means little to anyone outside the legal world if you are a district judge, a high court judge or an appeal judge because the outside world just hears “judge”. In the same way, it won’t matter to an outsider whether you are a set designer or an assistant art director – it’s all the same to an outsider. Few would think less of anyone for having one job title or contract over another, nor are you less worthy if you are between contracts. Such distinctions don’t seem important to people outside those worlds. Having many or few job titles, contracts or commissions does not mean you are more or less valuable or lovable. Someone else’s success is not your failure. You are still both worthy of love. You may have to say that to yourself out loud: “I am worthy of love.” You’ve probably got so used to your comparison game, that it feels like “the truth”, but it isn’t. It’s just a game that makes you feel bad. When you notice yourself playing it, congratulate yourself on catching it and switch your focus. You won’t improve overnight, but with practice, you can shift this over time. And, finally, you might not be the best judge of your own creative work. You only know what you wanted it to look like, whereas others can appreciate it for what it does look like.

5/8/2022,"Sonia Sodha’s article brilliantly highlights the unfair advantage that young people who happen to be able to go to university enjoy over their counterparts who happen not to – ie a government-subsidised and societally supported transition to adulthood and independent living (“Is it fair that we spend so much helping middle-class children into adulthood?”, Comment). There are other structural inequalities that see young people who enter the world of work (and for whom university may not be an option) further disadvantaged. The national living wage applies only to those over 23, yet dental treatment, prescriptions, eye tests and bus travel (in Brighton, anyhow) cost 18- to 22-year-olds in full-time employment exactly the same as adults aged 23 and over. Meanwhile, those in full-time higher education can apply for low-income free prescriptions and access-free dental treatment up to the age of 19; receive income from a student loan that is exempted from their personal tax allowance; and can avail themselves of cheaper student travel and discounts on countless good and services (including eye tests and glasses). The government could do much to level things up for young people – it seems it simply chooses not to. In the meantime, pensioners (the biggest voting group) continue to enjoy free bus travel regardless of income.Lauren ShukruBrighton Sonia Sodha’s race-to-the-bottom logic is rife. Instead of abolishing tuition fees, investing in schools or ending the rent crisis, we should just defund universities even further? Already, the sector is funded through crippling loans rather than the government. Universities don’t get to make up their own grading scales, they have external examiners to ensure parity; where this fails, it is because of corruption induced by fee and funding structures. If there are more middle-class than working-class students, we need to address the shortcomings in education and prospects that make it so, not further stratify society by sending working-class students into internships. University education has nothing inherently to do with vocational training, and the sooner it is decoupled from the idea that society needs to somehow get “value for money” from this, the better. If, as Sodha claims, “new research suggests that going to university is associated with a decline in racist and authoritarian attitudes”, this is all the more reason to encourage more people to study to this level, regardless of what work they end up doing.Pil and Galia KollectivLondon E2 Surprise, surprise, a childcare recruitment crisis (“Staff shortages force nurseries to close – and it’s going to get worse”, News). A friend with a social sciences degree, NVQ levels 3 and 5 and more than 30 years’ experience recently quit her nursery job to stack shelves in Aldi. Better working conditions, less stress and £1 an hour more in her pay packet. Says it all.Alexandra CosgraveLondon SW11 Keir Starmer accurately, if incompletely, describes the political bankruptcy of this Tory government (“The sound you can hear is the dying groans of a clapped-out government”, Comment). It is disappointing, though, that the only reference he makes to the appalling error of Brexit, foisted on a misled populace by the same crew currently mismanaging the country, is to identify potential VAT cuts as a “genuine Brexit benefit”. This is, to be sure, one more than Jacob Rees-Mogg has identified, but, in failing to address the folly of this government’s version of Brexit, and its destructive impact on our policies, economy, security and reputation, Starmer is failing to lead, and failing to begin the dialogue towards repairing the damage wrought by it.Tim LambertLondon SW1 It is remarkable that there are still those who want to defend the accuracy of Denis Avey’s account of his life as a British POW in Auschwitz (“Hero or hoax? New doubts dog story of man who broke into Auschwitz”, News). Avey’s memoir is perhaps unique in that it is a false account based on two other such textual deceptions (Charles Coward’s The Password is Courage and Stoker by Donald Watt). No doubt Avey wanted recognition very late in his life and, rather than simply write about what was a horrific experience, constructed himself as a rescuer of Jews. That he should do so is perhaps understandable if unfortunate, but the lack of care taken to check the ludicrous elements of his story does no credit on the publishers and others who helped him write the book and then promoted it and Avey. It is to be hoped that the forensic research of Alon Shapira and others will now lead to a major health warning if Avey’s memoir remains on sale.Professor Tony KushnerParkes Institute for the study of Jewish/non-Jewish relationsUniversity of Southampton William Keegan very wittily uses a scene from PG Wodehouse’s Much Obliged, Jeeves to make a positive comment on the French presidential election, but incidentally calls Bertie Wooster a Boris Johnson-like figure (“France has rejected the far right. So can Brexit Britain”, Business). This is a serious insult to Wooster, whose scrapes often arise from his trying to do a favour to a friend, with hilarious results from which Jeeves has to rescue him. Johnson’s scrapes arise from his own dishonesty and incompetence, from which there is no Jeeves to rescue the country.Vivienne KynastonBradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire To say that “Labour was too relaxed about rampant finance capitalism and too heedless of the downsides of globalisation”, as Andrew Rawnsley argued, is the understatement of the decade (“The lessons that Keir Starmer can learn from New Labour’s famous landslide victory”, Comment). The “radical advances” he justly celebrates were largely undone, as the French economist Thomas Piketty has shown, by a massive transfer and concentration of wealth into the hands of the 1%, and a concomitant reduction in the living standards of the vast majority, creating an unprecedented challenge to the would-be regulators of capital. The impoverishment that led millions to vote for Brexit in their despair is now intensified by Covid and war, which Labour describes as a cost-of-living crisis. That is certainly one symptom of a crisis at whose heart is a fundamental question for the left: is political regulation a feasible solution to capital’s reluctance to coexist with humankind and the planet?Martin YarnitSheffield While skim-reading the Observer, I was initially struck by the magnanimous headline attached to Tim Adams’s piece (“Anyone with a heart is bound to feel sadness at Boris Becker’s fall”, Comment).

5/8/2022,"NoMad London, 28 Bow Street, London WC2E 7AW (020 3906 1600). Snacks and starters £9-£30, mains £27-£49, desserts £14, wines from £38 Welcome to wonderland. Or perhaps, to be more precise, AdLand. For here at NoMad London, everything is art-directed to within an inch of its life. The public rooms are beautiful. The food is beautiful. Therefore, I too must be beautiful. There is handpainted wallpaper and dark wood and velvet plush and oxblood leather and acres of marble. The shelves in the library upstairs are filled with real books, of a sort you might want to read. They are an expression of literary taste, rather than something bought by the metre. The conversion of what was, until 2006, the Bow Street Magistrates Court where Oscar Wilde was once held, is magnificent. Not that they’d be so gauche as to show it off. Just as with the original NoMad hotel in New York, the lighting here is moody, verging on the dark, verging on: “Oh God am I suffering from macular degeneration?” No, you’ve merely chosen to go out for dinner in central London in 2022. Given the vertiginous rise in energy prices, this could be taken as an economically savvy move, masquerading as a style statement. Except economy is not exactly part of the mission statement. I should say that, while I’m obviously going to point and laugh at various things along the way, I had a lovely time at NoMad. But bloody hell it’s expensive. As in: who are all these other people paying for their own tea and which offshore tax haven are they using? When I pick up the bill at the end of an evening and cringe at the very thought of putting through the expenses claim, I know something’s up. I love my time with the leather-aproned and expertly coiffed barman downstairs, who serves us a perfectly made ice-cold daiquiri for £16 and a single glass of rosé pinot noir for £15. I appreciate that he went to get us a bowl of olives from the bar upstairs, because down here the only snacks available are smoked trout rillettes for £16 or fried chicken for £19 and so on. I enjoy being wafted from that bar area into the vast three-storey atrium that houses the restaurant. It has about it a touch of the New Orleans French Quarter. It is edged by a stack of colonnaded balconies from which foliage drips. Illumination comes from hanging lanterns and guttering candles and carefully positioned spots. There are squishy velvet banquettes in shades of olive and chartreuse. They are so squishy, we have to construct a litter out of the scatter cushions to raise our height to something manageable against that of the table. Ah, that’s better. I won’t bang on about the prices, save to say starters top out at £30, mains include a roast chicken for two at £98 and there’s nothing on the wine list below £38 a bottle. It is what it is. But I detect a mismatch here. Do the people thronging these tables really care about this serious thumper of a wine list, clearly constructed by a total nerd, with their pronounced interest in skin-contact wines? And do the punters care about the serious, precise effort that has gone into the food? Among the starters are deep-fried baby globe artichokes, in the Roman style, with a carefully acidulated mint and pistachio sauce that has been passed to a velvety smoothness. Taut slivers of cured mackerel rest under candy-coloured ribbons of pickled vegetables, so the plate looks like an explosion in a dressmaker’s. Curls of crispy seaweed add a layer of texture, alongside beads of toasted buckwheat. It’s a true stunner. As, in its own way, are pillowy ricotta gnudi, liquid at their centre, with freshly podded broad beans, a brilliant green broad bean purée, the whole lifted by gratings of the much-prized bottarga, the cured and dried roe of the grey mullet. Greedily, we pull apart the domed loaf of bouncy focaccia and use it as a vehicle for the bowl of whipped goat’s curd. A rectangle of confit pork, with crackling like set butterscotch, and a roasted chop, is advertised as coming with strawberries, the sort of innovation people shake their heads at. Except it’s masterful, the acidity and the sweetness playing catch up with each other. A plate of fat grilled scallops with crushed peas, minted pea purée and carrots under mandolined discs of multicoloured carrot is a study in green, orange and purple. I stare out into the room, at the flash of jewellery and the shine of leather trouser. How many of these diners are here for the details on these plates and how many for the scene? Dance music thrums, gently vibrating our lower colon as if attempting to make space for our dinner. Most of my fellow diners are, like me, through the first flush of youth. They have to be or they couldn’t afford it. I doubt many would choose to listen to this music at home. But here they are, among all the shiny surfaces and the saggy cushions, wearing young people’s clothes with a wide-eyed desperation. We sigh over our side dish, a spectacularly well-made semicircle of potato rosti, the crisply rugged exterior giving way to the soft oniony innards. We frown over our desserts because the grace and technique deployed with every other dish suddenly disappears. Part of the problem is that while they read nicely, they are mostly assemblages of crumbed things and iced things. The other problem is, weirdly, a heavy hand with the salt. A blood orange sorbet with shards of meringue has a salty tang, as does the crumbled banana and pecan cake with a milk chocolate crémeux. It’s just odd. At the bottom of the dessert menu there’s a box which reads: “Night at the NoMad. Price Upon Request.” I ask our perfectly poised waiter what this means. She makes a delicate speech about pleasure coming at the end of the meal. If the date is going really well, some of those pleasures might need to be taken away from the table. She opens her eyes wide as if inviting me to finish the sentence, mentally. Ah. If you want to shag your dining companion you can get a room, price on request. I ask: she goes away to check. It’s £495. But the bill is already £309 and our own bed is only a couple of miles south. It’s a menu item too far. We pay, dance back up the moodily lit stairs, out through the front doors once used by Oscar Wilde, and back into the real world.

5/8/2022,"Birgit Einchinger Grüner Veltliner Strass, Kamptal, Austria 2020 (from £12, hic-winemerchants.com; justerinis.com) It’s spring, the sap is rising and the world is alive with green. And at this most uplifting and promising time of the year, what could be more fitting than a wine style that itself seems to draw on the same abundant verdant energy? For many of us that might mean sauvignon blanc. But in a year in which the variety has been harder to source than it has been for many years (thanks to small harvests in its heartlands in both New Zealand and the Loire), I’m thinking of a wine whose very name evokes the colour green: Austria’s very own grüner veltliner. The green grape from the village of Veltlin, to give the name its full translation, has become the country’s most widely planted white grape variety, and is capable of providing wines in a range of styles. But even at its richest there’s always a hint of the forest, and, as in Birgit Eiginger’s supremely vibrant example, a distinctive salt-and-pepper spiciness. E H Booth Grüner Veltliner, Drunstein, Wachau, Austria 2019 (£10.50, Booths) Although riesling thrives in Austria (and is perhaps responsible for the lion’s share of the country’s very finest wines), Austrian grüner veltliner is much easier to find in the UK’s bigger wine shops: indeed, in what might be called the vinous mainstream, it’s become all-but synonymous with Austrian white wine. That’s not so much of a problem given that supermarket grüner veltliner is often superb value, generally in a lighter, aromatic, zestily drinkable style that is very good at matching leafy salads including – if the wine comes, as Aldi’s Specially Selected Grüner Veltliner, Niederösterrich 2020 (£6.99) does, with a dash of sugar othe cusp between dry and off-dry – spicy, herby Vietnamese style salads. But supermarket grüner is capable of offering rather more than that, especially when its production comes courtesy of a really top-level producer such as Domâne Wachau, the super-co-operative in the eponymous (and beautiful) wine region on the Danube, responsisble for Booths’ rippling, gorgeous, perfectly ripe own-label grüner bottling. Schloss Gobelsburg Grüner Veltliner Langenlois, Kamptal, Austria 2020 (£21.50, standrewswines.co.uk) Austria is still sometimes presented as a kind of rising star in the world of wine, as if wine production in the country was something new and not something deeply ingrained in the culture, with roots going back at least as far as Roman times. All of which might come to seem even more absurd when you consider the history of one of the country’s finest producers, Schloss Gobelsburg, which can trace its first vineyard back to the Cistercian monks of the 12th century. Still, the estate’s modern progress is similar to that of Austrian wine as a whole: both have been through a renaissance over the past three decades, with Gobelsburg able to trace its revival specifically to 1996, when the current estate manager, Michael Moosbrugger, took up the reins. Gobelsburg makes numerous brilliant single-vineyard wines with both grüner and riesling, while the Langenlois, a blend of vines from the eponymous village, beautifully captures a classically grüner combination of stone-fruited fleshiness and celery-salted savouriness.

5/8/2022,"The headlines describing the performance of the main parties in last week’s local elections were undramatic, but they disguised a profound truth. The Conservatives suffered a dismal set of losses following the police fines for the prime minister and the chancellor for breaking the law during the pandemic. Labour achieved eye-catching success in London and made some progress elsewhere, but not enough for a party hoping to win an outright majority at the next general election. The Liberal Democrats went some way towards restoring their role as a repository of protest votes and as challenger to the Tories in swathes of the south and west. Nationalist parties performed well. The most important dimension of last Thursday’s results is what they might mean for the country’s constitutional settlement. Sinn Féin’s success in the Northern Ireland assembly elections, coupled with the growing possibility of a Labour administration in Westminster contingent on SNP support, could have long-term and irreversible ramifications for the relationship between the UK’s four constituent nations. The Tories have tried to shrug off their losses as the usual mid-term slump. But there are signs that these are indicators of structural rather than cyclical malaise. Boris Johnson is a deeply unpopular leader, and the Lib Dem resurgence is eating into the Conservative vote share. By the time of the next general election voters will be suffering even more as a result of unsustainably high energy, fuel and food costs. As Brexit has declined in salience as an issue for voters, the electoral coalition that Johnson so successfully forged off it in 2019 is looking more fragile. But the flip side is not Labour surging ahead in all the areas where the Conservatives are retreating; the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the SNP have benefited. There were bright spots for Labour: taking Westminster off the Tories to cement its dominance in London; good results in Wales; and the first tentative signs of a Scottish recovery. But these only translate into a moderate lead over the Conservatives and are not suggestive of a party on a trajectory to win an outright majority in the next general election. Expecting Labour to achieve this just five years after its worst election defeat since 1935 under Jeremy Corbyn would be a tall order. But Johnson has been beset by crisis after crisis, and Labour should be doing better given the state of the economy. Sir Keir Starmer has made important steps to distance himself from Corbyn on antisemitism within Labour and on foreign policy, but has struggled to articulate a positive vision. He seems much more comfortable defining himself by his opposition to Johnson and the left of his party than communicating what he stands for. Labour has to do more to convince the country that it has a positive vision for the future, and the policies to realise it. Labour’s solid, but far from stellar, performance makes a hung parliament more likely, with a Labour government reliant on the SNP and the Lib Dems. Nicola Sturgeon is likely to demand another referendum on Scottish independence as the price of that support. She is out of step with the Scottish public on this – a survey for Scotland in Union out today suggests that fewer than a third of Scots back the SNP’s policy for a referendum next year, and polling suggests that there is no pro-independence majority. But it is too close for comfort, and a second referendum would dominate UK politics for the years following the election, to the exclusion of other important issues. In Northern Ireland, the collapse in the DUP’s vote paved the way for Sinn Féin to claim first place in elections to the Stormont assembly. This is no reflection of growing public support for Irish reunification – Sinn Féin’s vote share has increased only marginally since 2017 and support for a united Ireland has remained fairly consistent around the 30% mark in recent years. But it has huge implications for power-sharing in Stormont and the political stability of Northern Ireland. The DUP opposes the Northern Ireland protocol that introduced post-Brexit border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK; Sinn Féin views it as an acceptable way out of the conundrum Brexit poses for the Good Friday agreement. The DUP will probably make Johnson breaking the protocol the condition of entering a power-sharing administration with Sinn Féin, which would lead to damaging retaliatory measures from the EU. Six years after the Brexit vote, it remains unclear how taking the UK out of the single market and customs union, thus requiring customs checks either on the island of Ireland or in the Irish Sea, could ever be consistent with power-sharing and consensual politics in Northern Ireland. The issue will only become more existential in the run-up to the end of 2024, the deadline for the Stormont assembly to vote on consent for the protocol to continue. Westminster politics is likely to continue to be dominated by allegations and counter-allegations about the breaking of Covid rules, and the announcement of and reaction to government policies with the sole purpose of distracting from bad economic news, such as its dreadful plans to forcibly deport asylum seekers to Rwanda and its destructive proposal to privatise Channel 4. But last week’s results sound a warning note for any politician who supports the union: a more fragmentary politics across the whole country could undermine stability in Northern Ireland, and end up changing the shape of the UK forever.

5/8/2022,"The UN is to stage a rare donor conference on Wednesday in a bid to raise the $80m (£65m) necessary to prevent an ageing oil tanker off the west coast of Yemen exploding and causing an environmental disaster potentially four times worse than the Exxon Valdez spill near Alaska in 1989. The money is needed to offload more than 1.14m barrels of oil that have been sitting in the decrepit cargo ship, Safer, for more than six years because of an impasse between Houthi groups and the Saudi-backed government over ownership and responsibility. Previous UN mediation efforts over the potentially lethal byproduct of Yemen’s civil war have failed, partly because the Houthi rebels that now control the capital, Sana’a, have not been able to agree terms for UN-commissioned engineers to board the ship. The Houthis have regarded the ship and its lucrative cargo as their possession and a bargaining chip in the negotiations with the Saudi- and Emirati-backed forces. Expert engineers and environmentalists have warned the ship is an unexploded timebomb capable of causing an ecological disaster. UN estimates suggest that if the ship’s cargo is unleashed into the Red Sea, more than 200,000 fishermen would lose their jobs and $20bn would be required for a clean-up operation. But under a new agreement, laboriously negotiated over six months by the UN and Dutch diplomats, an international donor conference will aim to raise the required $80m to offload the light crude oil. The plan is the brainchild of the UN resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, who claims it has the support of the Saudi-backed and Houthi-backed governments. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Houthis on 5 March that allows the UN to transfer about 1.1m barrels of oil from the vessel, which is stranded 8km off Ras Isa port on Yemen’s Houthi-held west coast. The oil would be transferred to a secure vessel which would remain in place. A new tanker would be purchased for the Houthis within 18 months to replace Safer, thus providing them with the insurance that they would be able to operate a profitable oil export industry when the civil war ends. The Safer vessel would be towed and sold for scrap. The Houthis would have no legal or commercial liability. Gressly said the crisis was urgent since “in March, a UN-led mission to the Ras Isa peninsula confirmed that the 45-year-old supertanker is rapidly decaying. It is at imminent risk of spilling a massive amount of oil due to leakages or an explosion”. Inert air on the ship that normally inhibits an explosion has dissipated, the UN said. Doug Weir at the Conflict and Environment Observatory said: “While some may question the $80m price tag of the UN-mediated plan to address the threat posed by the FSO Safer, the costs of inaction – which start at $20bn for managing the consequences of a catastrophic spill – are far, far greater. The world has watched this situation grow more dangerous with every passing month, and it’s vital that donors provide the money that is needed to allow this urgent plan to proceed this summer.” Greenpeace said the UN plan must be implemented before October, “when the wind and the currents will be too dangerous and hinder any rescue operation. Lack of funding cannot be an excuse to fail.” Constructed in 1976 as an oil tanker and converted a decade later to be a floating storage facility for oil, no structural repairs have been made to the 376-metre-long vessel since Yemen’s civil war started in 2015. It contains 36 different oil storage facilities amounting to a capacity of more than 3m barrels. The unavailability of diesel fuel has meant that Safer’s engines have not been started for several years, and the structure has been exposed to humidity and corrosion with little or no maintenance. A major spillage would force the closure of the ports of Hodeidah and As Salif – which are essential for commercial imports and the provision of life-saving humanitarian assistance. Depending on the season and prevailing wind and currents, the environmental impact could hit Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia, as well as disrupt shipping through the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea. The Red Sea remains highly biodiverse, with coral reefs, coastal mangroves and many endemic species. The donor conference comes at a time of the first nationwide ceasefire in Yemen in six years and a Saudi-overseen change in the leadership of the Aden government. A new seven-strong anti-Houthi Presidential Leadership Council has been formed, a move that involves the long-serving and ailing President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi relinquishing his executive powers.",News/World news,UN leads £65m plan to stop huge oil spill off Yemen during first ceasefire in six years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/un-leads-65m-plan-to-stop-huge-oil-spill-off-yemen-during-first-ceasefire-in-six-years
5/8/2022,"Dmitry Bivol won a unanimous decision over Canelo Álvarez to retain the WBA light heavyweight title in a major upset on Saturday night at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bigger, longer Bivol landed the cleaner and harder shots for most of the night in a fight that was largely non-competitive. All three judges handed down scores of 115-113. (The Guardian had it 117-111 for Bivol. It marks the second official defeat of Álvarez’s career and the first since a 2013 majority-decision loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. “I proved myself today,” Bivol said. “If you don’t believe in yourself, what do you do? You’ll achieve nothing. I believed. My team believed me. And you all should believe in yourself to achieve what you want.” In the immediate aftermath, Álvarez said he would exercise his rematch clause. “Of course I [want a rematch],” Álvarez said. “This doesn’t end like this.”",Sport/Sport,Dmitry Bivol dominates Canelo Álvarez in shocker to retain light heavyweight title,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/dmitry-bivol-canelo-alvarez-fight-upset
