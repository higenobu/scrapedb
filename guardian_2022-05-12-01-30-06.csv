5/12/2022,"In the first five minutes of the late artist Ntozake Shange’s masterwork, for colored girls who have considered suicide/ when the rainbow is enuf, a character makes plea of witness and recognition: “somebody/ anybody sing a black girl’s song … bring her out to know herself” for colored girls…, as a work, is the answer, a cannon-creating work that blends poetry and movement, along with other storytelling elements, to illuminate the lived experience of Black women. First conceived in 1974, the play is rightfully revered as one of the most important pieces in theater to date, but also for its unquantifiable influence. More than three decades after its 1976 Broadway run, the first Broadway revival of for colored girls… has launched, directed and choreographed by Camille A Brown, the first Black woman to direct and choreograph a Broadway show in 65 years. The most recent run has garnered 7 Tony award nominations, including best revival of a play and best direction of a play for Brown. Brown’s connection to for colored girls… dates back to childhood, when her mother would repeat the phrase “don’t let anyone take your stuff away,” in reference to a monologue featured in the show by lady in green. Brown, whom Shange interviewed for her first posthumous work Dance We Do, now leads the show’s first Broadway revival and is excited that audiences get to experience Shange’s timeless work. “Even though the show is over 40 years old, it still speaks to today, and it can still tap into and connect with Black women, but also other people too,” said Brown. for colored girls… follows a cast of Black women – lady in red, lady in orange, lady in blue, lady in yellow, lady in green, lady in brown and lady in purple. The seven are scattered across various cities, woven together by mutual stories of love, heartbreak, pain, and other fixtures of Black womanhood. “These women definitely go through struggles, but they persevere and they move through them. That is what is [an] important and empowering part of the show,” said Brown. To reduce for colored girls… to a play is an oft-repeated mistake. The lodestar piece isn’t just a culmination of monologues braided together in theme. Rather, for colored girls… is a choreopoem, “a combination of all forms of theater storytelling,” said Leah C Gardiner in a 2019 New York Times interview. Gardiner directed a 2019 revival of the show at the Public Theater in New York City. As they retell their stories, the women dance and stomp, laugh and cry as individuals, yes, but also as a flock. Almost no story is shared in total isolation, with even singular anecdotes receiving snaps and “mms” from the women on stage, hues of empathy and community care dashed throughout. But amid the show’s tragedies, for colored girls… also embraces a levity often missing from depictions of Black womanhood. Humor is central to Shange’s work, with Brown using school yard games that many Black women will find familiar, references she also imbues in her 2015 work Black Girl: Linguistic Play, a reference piece for this mounting. “We go through spectrums,” said Brown in reference to embracing the joy in Shange’s piece. “We go through pain, but we also go through joy too, and there’s so much within one poem that goes from feeling like it is maybe low and painful, but then a reclamation happened.” To trace the origins of for colored girls…, one has to go to Bacchanal, a feminist bar near Berkley, California. In December 1974, Shange would share short readings of her poetry, as dancer Paula Moss danced with musical accompaniment. Influence of the Black Arts Movement and her time at the Sonoma State College’s women’s studies program, Shange channeled her own personal trials into a fusion of dance, poetry and music that were the building blocks of for colored girls… Later on, Shange’s poetry readings expanded to include five other women who choreographed to Shange’s words. “We were a little raw, self-conscious [and] eager. Whatever we were discovering in ourselves had been in process among us for almost two years,” said Shange to the Washington Post in a 1977 interview. After a run in the Bay area, with Shange’s drafted work drawing niche interest, Shange and Moss traveled to New York’s Studio Rivbea, a jazz performance loft, to perform the dance-poetry. There, a version of the show, structured more into a play, was workshopped and mounted at the Public Theater, off-Broadway, before making a Broadway run in 1976 at the Booth Theatre. Then and now, for colored girls… is most regarded for giving rare, authentic insight into what it means be a Black woman, “a metaphysical dilemma”, Shange wrote. Written and portrayed by Black women, for colored girls… laid bare truths on the blighted intersection of misogynoir, not as an educational tool for white audiences, but for Black women to see the full breadth of our experiences on stage. “It wasn’t about trying to teach people about who [these] women are. It was about creating a safe space for Black women to hold space for each other, and express who we are and how we interact with each other,” said Brown. Brown added: “It’s a Black woman’s voice, and Black women are seeing reflections of themselves.” For colored girls… has also inspired a generation of Black theatermakers, specifically Black female playwrights who embraced Shange’s unabashed truth telling and dedicated focus to Black women. “She very much encouraged Black women to appreciate the fullness of themselves and to speak from their perspectives, not trying to fit into anyone else’s structure,” said playwright Ngozi Anyanwu in a 2018 Times interview. Amid the show’s early closing, Brown says that she encourages audiences to see the production while they still can and be touched by Shange’s work. “I was hoping that people would see it as movement and text working together in order to share these very important, very vulnerable, very spiritual and ritualistic stories,” said Brown. for colored girls… is at the Booth Theatre in New York until 22 May",Arts/Stage,for colored girls: the 40-year-old masterwork that’s still inspiring audiences,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/11/for-colored-girls-ntozoke-shange-broadway-revival-camille-browno
5/12/2022,"Plans to require lobbyists, PR firms and other professionals in the UK to register their work for Russia, China or any other foreign country have been unexpectedly left out of the national security bill published on Wednesday. Insiders said key decisions about what activities would have to be registered had yet to be taken, meaning the foreign agent scheme will have to be introduced via a government amendment to the bill in a few weeks. A broad definition could require universities and thinktanks to disclose sources of foreign state funding, but there has been concern that simply receiving money from abroad does not turn an organisation into a lobbyist for a hostile state. Whitehall sources said the delay had been partly caused by the war in Ukraine. “Some of the people working on the policy ended up working on other things,” one said, and new ideas had emerged in response to the Russian invasion. There have been calls for the UK to introduce a two-tier system, imposing different requirements on Russia, China and Iran and other states deemed to be hostile to the UK, and a lower requirement on allies. The Conservative MP Bob Seely discussed options for a foreign agent registration scheme in a pamphlet last year and proposed a differential approach. “The threat to democratic transparency from Chinese state entities or Russian oligarchs is greater than, for example, the New Zealand tourist board,” he said. The planned foreign agent registration scheme was billed as a key element of the national security bill, the biggest revision to espionage legislation since the late 1980s, and highlighted in the past 24 hours by Downing Street and ministers. Overnight, Priti Patel, the home secretary, had said the bill would require “individuals to register certain arrangements with foreign governments, to deter or disrupt state threats activity in the UK”, but she made no reference to the delay. On Wednesday officials declined to say which individuals would be covered, and whether they would include lawyers or academics working on behalf of a foreign state as well as lobbyists and public relations agencies. The situation would become clear when the amendment was published, they said. The registration scheme is based on a long-established system in the US, introduced in the 1930s in response to concerns about antisemitic activities on behalf of Nazi Germany. Australia adopted its own system in 2018 in response to concerns about covert Chinese influence. Britain has also become concerned about Chinese espionage on its territory. This has been heavily focused on obtaining trade and commercial secrets, but there are signs that Beijing has been seeking political influence too. In January MI5 circulated a rare interference alert, warning that Christine Lee, an Anglo-Chinese lawyer, was seeking to improperly influence MPs and peers on behalf of China’s ruling Communist party. However, Lee was not subject to any criminal prosecution, despite the allegation she was a Chinese agent. The national security bill will not be retrospective but is intended to allow for the prosecution of similar cases in future by updating the definition of espionage. Much of Britain’s official secrets legislation dates back to acts passed in 1911, 1920 and 1939 and relies on archaic terms, criminalising the passing of sketches to the enemy. If the bill is passed, anybody found guilty of disclosing “protected information” that is prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK to a foreign power could be sentenced to life imprisonment. Disclosing trade secrets or helping a foreign intelligence agency could lead to a 14 years in prison, and for the first time it will be illegal to be a covert foreign spy. However, there will be no government attempt to revise the 1989 Official Secrets Act, which covers the unauthorised disclosure of classified government information, including by whistleblowers, because there was no public consensus on how to proceed. Campaigners had called for the introduction of a statutory public interest defence to protect leakers – people such as the former civil servant Clive Ponting – who in the past have been prosecuted. But Whitehall sources said such reform was opposed by the intelligence agencies and so any reform of the 1989 act would have to wait.",News/UK news,Foreign agent scheme omitted from UK national security bill,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/foreign-agent-scheme-omitted-from-uk-national-security-bill
5/12/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel opened Tuesday’s show with the national shortage on baby formula, which has left parents desperate and led authorities to warn people not to try to make their own recipe. “I don’t know – I’m sure the ivermectin and bleach people could figure this out for us,” Kimmel deadpanned. “Just mix you up some Gatorade and some baby powder, throw in some breakfast sausage and it blend it up real good, the baby should be fine. “That is a tough spot to be in, not having baby formula,” he continued. “Because what are you going to do? You can’t go to Wendy’s and get them a Frosty. You have to have the formula. “I’ll tell ya, there’s never been a better time for the supreme court to force women to have more kids than right now,” he joked. In other “baby” news, Elon Musk said he would reverse Twitter’s ban on Donald Trump if his deal to buy the social media company goes through. Speaking via video link at a car conference organized by the Financial Times, Musk called the ban “a morally bad decision to be clear – and foolish in the extreme”. “Oh good, we have the part-time DJ who makes flamethrowers and cars that fart in charge of morality now,” said Kimmel. “The guy who named his kids after Roman numerals will make sure we don’t do anything foolish. “But if Trump does go back on Twitter, he’s going to need a phone, which he claims he doesn’t have,” Kimmel added. New York’s attorney general has ordered Trump to turn over four cellphones as part of an investigation into his business, but he’s claimed the phones are missing. He’s currently held in contempt of court at the tune of $10,000 a day. In addition, “Trump says he hasn’t used email, text messages or a computer for work in more than a decade, and I actually believe that,” Kimmel said. “Because I can’t imagine him sitting at a laptop doing work. Here’s how I bet Trump works: he probably has some former strip bouncer who works for him, named Vinny St Cleveland or Bobby Cabbage or something, who stands outside his bathroom with brief case of Diet Cokes while Trump shouts things like, ‘Put an offer in to buy the Indian Ocean!’ through the door. “And then Vinny or Bobby will use a burner phone to call some Republican with an ulcer who has to explain that the Indian Ocean isn’t for sale,” he continued. “And by the time he gets done, Trump’s already asleep on the toilet. When he wakes up, it’s time to climb into the golf cart and eat a pie, right? That’s how it goes.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers touched on reports that Joe Biden warned his national security officials that recent press leaks about intelligence sharing with Ukraine could further inflame tensions with Russia. “So remember, the Ukrainian people have our full support, but if anyone asks, no they don’t,” Meyers joked. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are reportedly split over what to do if the supreme court officially overturns Roe v Wade, as last week’s leaked draft opinion indicates. “Apparently they can’t decide between a ticker tape parade or a dance party,” Meyers joked. The Senate has passed a bill to expand security for supreme court justices, “and just in time – did you see how close that lunatic got to Clarence Thomas?” Meyers said over a photo of Thomas with his wife Ginni, who tried to help Trump officials overturn the 2020 election and has peddled ludicrous conspiracy theories. And officials in Nevada said they’ve found numerous human remains in Lake Mead as water levels drop during an ongoing drought. “On the upside, the mafia is now very invested in stopping climate change,” Meyers quipped.",Arts/Culture,Kimmel on baby formula shortage: ‘Never been a better time to force women to have kids’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/11/jimmy-kimmel-recap-baby-formula-elon-musk-trump
5/12/2022,"Not long before everything became about Carlos Alcaraz, Rafael Nadal was the story in men’s tennis this year. He had only just taken his first uncertain steps back from a near six-month layoff when, suddenly, he was spectacularly lifting the Australian Open trophy, compiling a 20-match winning streak and embarking on the best start to a season in his 20-year career. Yet as quickly as fortunes can change and momentum can unexpectedly build in tennis, so too can it all collapse. This week at the Italian Open, Nadal finds himself in a starkly different position as he continues to navigate his return to form after being out for six weeks following the fractured rib he suffered from in the final of Indian Wells. In his first match in Rome, Nadal overcame a complicated start before finishing strongly to defeat John Isner 6-3, 6-1. The overall goal against Isner’s often impenetrable serve is simple for all: take care of your own service games at all cost, then land enough returns to eventually have a chance in his own. But Nadal’s lack of sharpness nearly cost him. At 3-3, under minimal pressure, careless errors caked his game and Isner held two break points. Nadal was cagey on both, just hoping for Isner to miss, and he was fortunate that Isner obliged with two poor, early unforced errors. Just one substandard game puts anyone in trouble against Isner but Nadal took strength from his subsequent recovery and he immediately broke serve himself. The match quickly shifted and after sealing the first set, he flitted through the rest of the encounter, serving and returning well enough, maintaining his groundstroke depth and limiting his errors as he eased to victory. As a bitter fight for a record-extending 14th French Open title looms on the horizon for Nadal, he needs as many matches as possible against difficult opposition who rise to the occasion. Having been satisfied in Madrid last week even after his quarter-final loss to Alcaraz, Nadal believes that he has started from scratch. “My body is like an old machine,” Nadal said on Monday. “To put this machine on again it takes some time. It’s not the same when you are 19 than when you are almost 36, with all the issues that I went through in my tennis career.” While his first three months of the season were testament to how quickly form can return after an injury, Nadal distinguishes the two circumstances by his preparation; he at least had time to train and build up his confidence in the off-season, whereas he says that this time he has rushed back as soon it was physically safe to do so. Finding his feel and confidence will take time, yet the French Open begins a week on Sunday. Moments after the match was won, there was little surprise to see Nadal, still wearing his match attire, appear on the vacant practice court adjacent to the raging battle between Alex de Minaur and Tommy Paul. Nadal trained for another half an hour and then he was gone. “I talked very clearly since I came back that I am in a little bit of a rush, that I have to find as soon as possible the best feelings. I need to recover things that I missed because of the injury, of course,” he said of his additional session. “The only way for me to give myself a chance to recover the level that I want to recover, or I want to reach, is to work.” He will return to work on Wednesday against the ninth seed, Denis Shapovalov, in the third round. Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek, the world No 1, extended her winning streak to 24 matches with a 6-3, 6-0 win over Elena-Gabriela Ruse.",Sport/Sport,Rafael Nadal takes positive step back from injury with win over Isner,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/11/rafael-nadal-takes-positive-step-back-from-injury-with-win-over-isner
5/12/2022,"The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. If Russia attempts to annex the Kherson region it would make a peace agreement more unlikely, as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Russia’s withdrawal to prewar positions was a precondition for any successful negotiation. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. The annexation call was made on Wednesday by Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military administration Russia put in place to run Kherson in late April. Russia occupied Kherson in March and seized its city council building in late April. “The city of Kherson is Russia; there will be no the KNR [Kherson People’s Republic] on the territory of the Kherson region, there will be no referendums,” said Stremousov in a televised briefing. “It will be a single decree based on the appeal of the leadership of the Kherson region to the president of the Russian Federation, and there will be a request to make [Kherson] into a full-fledged region of the Russian Federation.” Stremousov previously said that Kherson would begin using the rouble currency, a move seen as creeping integration into Russia. Russian officials who have visited Kherson have promised not to abandon the region. “Russia is here to stay forever,” said Andrei Turchak, secretary general of Russia’s ruling United Russia party, while visiting Kherson last week. “There should be no doubt about it. There will be no return to the past.” But similar requests for annexation from territories such as the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic have languished for years, as the Kremlin has dangled integration while seeking to put pressure on Kyiv. Putin began his new war in Ukraine by announcing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, territories with local administrations also controlled by Russia. While there have been rumours they could hold new referendums to demand accession into Russia, that has not yet taken place. Local leaders say their model outcome is that of Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 after a referendum under a puppet government. But few Russians have a similar attachment to the Kherson, Donetsk, or Luhansk regions, or want to see them as part of the Russian Federation. Turchak gave a careful answer when asked if Kherson would become part of Russia: “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. In any case, the status will be determined by the residents,” he said. That view was echoed by the Kremlin on Wednesday, with its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying any appeal should be “decided by the residents of the Kherson region … and residents of the Kherson region should also determine their fate”. He also said the decision would have to be vetted by lawyers and legal experts to be “absolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea”. Analysts have said that the call for annexation without a referendum indicated the weakness of the Russian position in those regions. Russia “doesn’t feel stable on occupied areas, they can’t afford even fake referendum as in 2014. No local support at all,” wrote Maria Zolkina, a political analyst at Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based thinktank. Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, vowed that the Kherson region would be recaptured before any annexation could take place. “The invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser.",News/World news,Kherson’s military administrators to call for Russian annexation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/kherson-military-administrators-to-call-for-russian-annexation-ukraine

5/12/2022,"With his Leeds side in the relegation zone and just three games remaining, Jesse Marsch needs all the help he can get to keep them up. The excitable American has proved a welcome addition to the Premier League since stepping into the extremely big boots vacated by the saintly Marcelo Bielsa and has now revealed he would be calling on the combined forces of luminaries such as Mahatma Gandhi and JFK in a bid to motivate his players for their crucial ding-dong against Chelsea at Elland Road. “I have hundreds of quotes I use at different moments,” mused Marsch, piquing the interest of reporters who realised they were about to be given some juicy quotes to reproduce in their newspapers. “I try to think how they fit with who I am and how we play football. I love quotes, learning from people of the past. Sports figures, historical figures, whatever. The key is understanding what messages to use at the right time. I use things that resonate with me … there are historical figures, Gandhi, Mother Teresa, presidents like John F Kennedy.” While cynics might dismiss this as hokum, there’s certainly a time and a place for this sort of motivational speaking. However, The Fiver can’t help but feel that the time and place for Marsch to quote some of Gandhi’s fabled peace, love and understanding was at approximately 2.25pm last Sunday at the Emirates Stadium, specifically in the direction of Luke Ayling. Had he said “in a gentle way, Luke, you can shake the world”, the stand-in right-back might have resisted the urge to recklessly plough through Gabriel Martinelli and earn himself a red card that means he’ll sit out the rest of the season on the Naughty Step. His absence could cost Leeds extremely dearly. Channeling his own Mother Teresa, Chelsea boss Tommy T used his pre-match press conference to deny claims he’d had a half-time bust-up with Marcos Alonso during the draw with Wolves, following a full and frank exchange of views between the pair. “It started and ended in the first half and was not continued at half-time and nothing else,” tutted Tuchel, who still hauled Alonso off. “It was not continued at half-time and things are solved. That happens.” Of course, as a famous Calcutta-based nun once said, “discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment”, and the players of both Chelsea and Leeds will need to keep theirs in what promises to be quite a spicy encounter at Elland Road, where the points available could prove priceless. And now taking a leaf out of the Leeds manager’s book, The Fiver would like to invite you to read our own inspirational and traditional Quote of the Day. “Me, John O’Kane, and Raph Burke [all trainees] were upstairs and heard a voice and realised it was the gaffer.

5/12/2022,"The governor of Delaware has publicly condemned authorities in Georgia who searched a bus carrying a lacrosse team from a historically Black college, in what many called an instance of racial profiling. John Carney, a Democrat, released a statement about the incident, in which police officers searched the bus carrying the Delaware State University women’s lacrosse team after stopping the driver for a traffic violation. “I have watched video of this incident – it is upsetting, concerning and disappointing,” Carney said. “Moments like these should be relegated to part of our country’s complicated history, but they continue to occur with sad regularity in communities across our country. It’s especially hard when it impacts our own community.” The incident was first reported by the Delaware State school paper, the Hornet Newspaper, in April. The bus driver, Tim Jones, who is Black, was stopped by officers in Liberty county, Georgia, for reportedly driving in the left lane. During the stop, officers climbed aboard and informed students they would be searching their luggage for drugs. “If there is anything in your luggage, we’re probably gonna find it,” said one officer in video of the incident. “I’m not looking for a little marijuana, but I’m pretty sure you guys’ chaperones will probably be disappointed if we find it.” Officers proceeded to conduct the apparently unlawful search, rifling the suitcases of team members and using K-9 dogs. No drugs were found. The Delaware State coach, Pamella Jenkins, who was on the bus, called the search “very traumatizing”, adding that her players remained “composed” throughout. “The infuriating thing was the assumption of guilt on their [deputies’] behalf,” Jenkins told the Delaware News Journal. “That was what made me so upset because I trust my girls.” In a press conference on Tuesday, the Liberty county sheriff, William Bowman, defended the stop, saying he “does not believe any racial profiling took place”, the News Journal reported. “Before entering the motorcoach, the deputies were not aware that this school was historically Black or aware of the race or the occupants due to the height of the vehicle and tint of the windows,” Bowman said. Bowman also said police did not search the personal belongings of any lacrosse team members – a sharp contrast from the accounts of several people who were on the bus. In a letter to the school community on Monday, the Delaware State president, Tony Allen, said Carney, the office of the state attorney general, the state congressional delegation and the Congressional Black Caucus had been informed of the incident. “They, like me, are incensed,” Allen wrote. “We have also reached out to Georgia law enforcement and are exploring options for recourse – legal and otherwise – available to our student-athletes, our coaches and the university.” In his statement, Carney said his office would do “everything we can to assist the university with learning more about the incident and any appropriate next steps”. “I’m proud of our students for handling the experience with remarkable composure, though I’m sorry they were made to go through it at all,” the governor said.",News/US news,Delaware governor denounces police search of HBCU lacrosse bus in Georgia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/delaware-governor-carney-police-georgia-hbcu-lacrosse-team
5/12/2022,"Billions were wiped off the cryptocurrency market this week with the collapse of the Terra “stablecoin”. But is its failure just another example of the here-today-gone-tomorrow nature of the sector, or could it be the beginning of a wider downturn? Terra is a stablecoin – a cryptocurrency that is intended to have a fixed value, typically $1. Stablecoins function similarly to a bank in the crypto ecosystem, providing a safe place to store money and greasing the wheels of commerce. Many stablecoins, such as USDC and Tether, get their stability from large reserves, and are supposed to keep enough liquid assets on hand to cover all of the coins in circulation. But Terra is a new breed of “algorithmic stablecoin”, which effectively prints money out of thin air and uses a complex set of “smart contracts” to try to ensure the value hovers as close to $1 as possible. That arrangement worked – until it suddenly didn’t. Terra “broke its peg”. After hovering about $1 for almost a year, the value of one coin plummeted, first to 70¢, and then further, settling around 35¢ on Wednesday afternoon. The complex algorithmic deal that was supposed to keep the coin trading at a fixed price failed, as investors raced to liquidate their positions faster than the automatic stabilisers could kick in. The other half of the Terra stablecoin is a floating token called Luna. In theory, when the Terra value drops too low, Luna holders are supposed to automatically trade their coins in, propping the price up. But the value of Luna has also fallen precipitously, from $86 last week to just 86¢ today. The charismatic co-founder of Terraform Labs, which developed the stablecoin, Do Kwon, has promised action, telling investors: “I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you – know that I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this. Together.” As with every cryptocurrency bust, thousands of investors who thought they had discovered a get-rich-quick scheme are now finding they have lost almost all their money. Some are waiting for Kwon to step in with a rescue package, but others have lost faith in the project entirely. More fundamentally, though, Terra was seen as the shining light in the “decentralised finance” ecosystem. Critics had argued that its algorithm was more like a Ponzi scheme than a real reserve-backed currency, but its continued success bought Kwon the title of “crypto’s most-watched whale”, according to a profile on Bloomberg. The project had used its reserves to buy a large stake in bitcoin, further cementing the perception that it was too big to fail – until it did. Now, some are asking, if Terra could drop from a market cap of more than $45bn to less than $5bn in two days, what else in the system is on shaky territory? Could USDC or Tether collapse in a similar way? And if they went, what else would follow? The collapse of Terra may not turn out to be a Lehman Brothers for the cryptocurrency world, but it shows what it could look like.",News/Technology,Could Terra fall prove to be Lehman Brothers moment for crytocurrencies?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/11/terra-price-cryptocurrency-stablecoin
5/12/2022,"Twenty women have come forward to openly accuse one of France’s best-known television news presenters of sexual harassment and abuse – including rape – following an investigation by French journalists. Patrick Poivre d’Arvor – known as PPDA – has faced a number of accusations that emerged after a writer first went to police to accuse him of rape, in February last year. The investigation was later dropped. The news presenter responded by announcing last month he was taking legal action against 16 women who spoke to detectives for “slanderous denunciation”. On Tuesday, the investigative website Mediapart interviewed 18 women – 16 of them prepared to be named and filmed for the programme PPDA: 30 Years of Silence, and two who were present but hid their faces. A further two alleged victims were named and filmed talking of their encounters with the television star separately. The majority of the alleged sexual offences, which reportedly began in 1980, are now beyond the time limit for criminal proceedings under French law. Two of the alleged victims, who are now aged between 28 and 63 years, were minors at the time. Many of the alleged assaults reportedly took place in the presenter’s office at the television station after he had finished reading the prime-time news. Poivre d’Arvor, 74, has always denied any wrongdoing and insisted his relations with the women were consensual and part of a ritual of “seduction” involving no violence or constraint. He has described the allegations as “false from beginning to end”. A preliminary police investigation was launched in February last year when writer and journalist Florence Porcel, 38, accused Poivre d’Arvor of two counts of rape in 2004 and 2009. The investigation was dropped four months later as a judge said there was insufficient evidence on either side to press charges and the allegations were beyond the legal time limit. However, media coverage of Porcel’s accusation led to 22 other women coming forward to give evidence to the police. Seventeen of them lodged formal complaints, eight of them alleging rape, but the cases fell outside the time limit for prosecutions under French law and were not pursued. Three other cases are under investigation. Mediapart journalist Marine Turchi said the women had not met as a group before the programme was recorded and most had never spoken publicly before. Most of them said they had not spoken out at the time of the alleged assaults and rapes – except in some cases to family and friends – because they were afraid they would not be believed or that doing so would damage their careers. Nonce Paolini, the former chief executive of TF1, who ended Poivre d’Arvor’s contract in 2008, told Mediapart he had not known of the alleged abuse and harassment, which he described as “revolting”. “If we’d known anything, there would have been punishment. Obviously we didn’t know,” he said. Paolini added: “I want to tell these women that their suffering cannot leave anyone indifferent, especially not me either as a man, or as the former head [of the company]. I hope they will be able to get their cases reviewed by the courts.” Porcel said the women had formed a support group. “We wanted to show that we are united, that we are solid, that we are facing this together and that Patrick Poivre d’Arvor no longer makes us afraid. It seems also important to say I’m still standing and I intend to continue standing.” Porcel is pursuing further legal action against Poivre d’Arvor. Teacher Margaux Coquil-Gleizes described how she met Poivre d’Arvor when she was 17 and an aspiring novelist. She said he invited her to his hotel room. “I was young, naive, impressionable, flattered by the attention that Poivre d’Arvor was going to pay to my writing.” Once in the room she said the television star “pushed me on the bed, he undressed, he took my clothes off and penetrated me. At the time I was paralysed. It took a very long time for me to realise that it was a rape by surprise.” Journalist Justine Ducharne said she did not want to discuss details of what happened to her but described it as “a horror”. Last year, Poivre d’Arvor accused the women of hiding behind anonymity. “Nobody has dared come forward, face to face, to tell me what I did was not acceptable.” He did not accept Mediapart’s invitation to take part in the two-hour programme. In his 43-page legal complaint for slander against 16 of his accusers, Poivre d’Arvor deplored “a return to puritanism and censorship cleverly dressed up as the supposed protection of women”. He said: “Since the excitement generated by the #MeToo wave, the liberation of women’s voices has unfortunately had its share of excesses and abuses.” He also claimed the women were seeking fame and revenge. “No credit can be given to these 16 women, journalists or writers in search of fame who have become sudden feminists to support a former colleague, a friend, or even a simple activist for the women’s cause,” he said. “It is all about revenge on the part of women who have not received more consideration, or even a glance, from a man they once admired. “[This] makes the rejected or ignored respondents very bitter today, a bitterness that leads them to commit, out of belated revenge, the crime of slanderous denunciation.” Turchi said Poivre d’Arvor and his lawyers had been approached to take part in the programme. “We would have liked him to express himself and we asked him to do so, but he refused,” she said. Poivre d’Arvor’s lawyer, Philippe Naepels, had not responded to the Guardian at the time of writing.

5/12/2022,"The West End play Cock has faced criticism for operating a “dynamic pricing” ticketing model that saw the cost of a seat rise to £400. A spokesperson for the show, produced by Elliott & Harper Productions at the Ambassadors theatre in London, said on Tuesday that as Cock was reaching the end of its limited 13-week run, “the remaining premium ticket seats are based on supply and demand”. But after there was astonishment on social media at some of the ticket prices, the cost was considerably reduced on Wednesday. Earlier this week, screengrabs were shared showing that the production’s official booking system (not a secondary ticketing website) had several seats in the stalls in a £400 price band, plus booking fee. With the show’s eyebrow-raising title, comedian Bethany Black was among those who found the opportunity for a quip hard to resist: “£400 for cock in the stalls? What ever happened to Free Willy?” Others defended the decision of a commercial theatre production to maximise its profit. The spokesperson for Cock, which is set to close on 4 June, said that since it went on sale last year, “15% of all tickets sold have been at £20”. They added that there is a daily lottery for every performance, where tickets are also available for £20, but declined to comment further on the pricing of the show. On Wednesday, it was observed by theatre and education consultant Carl Woodward that seats in the stalls for a performance on 3 June were now available at £175 when they had been on sale for £400 on Monday. Tickets in two other price bands had been £350 and £300 on Monday but were now available for £150 and £125. Data collected by the Society of London Theatre for 2019 found that the average ticket price for its member venues, which include all of the commercial West End and London’s major subsidised theatres, was £52.17. Research by the Stage newspaper in 2017 revealed that the most expensive tickets for more than half of West End shows were priced above £100. Top-price “premium” tickets in the stalls for Hamilton, one of London’s most popular shows, cost £200. The Ambassadors is one of the West End’s smallest theatres, with a capacity of 444, and Cock received strong reviews when it opened in March. Jade Anouka, Phil Daniels and Joel Harper-Jackson are appearing alongside Bridgerton’s Jonathan Bailey in the play by Mike Bartlett. Harper-Jackson was originally the understudy for Taron Egerton, who was making his stage debut in Cock but withdrew from the play last month citing personal reasons. Egerton fainted during the first performance and later tested positive for Covid-19. Cock is directed by Marianne Elliott, who co-founded her production company with Chris Harper. Their first West End show was Simon Stephens’ Heisenberg: The Uncertainty Principle at the Wyndham’s theatre in 2017. Their revival of Stephen Sondheim’s Company was a West End hit and its New York staging was nominated for nine Tony awards this week. In November, Elliott & Harper Productions announced it had received a grant from the government’s culture recovery fund, which it said it would use to reopen its shows – including Company on Broadway – and produce work for the future. Bartlett’s play had a prominent cast when it was first staged in 2009: Ben Whishaw, Katherine Parkinson, Andrew Scott and Paul Jesson took the stage at the Royal Court’s Theatre Upstairs, London.",Arts/Stage,‘What happened to Free Willy?’ Cock ticket prices drop after shock at £400 seats,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/11/cock-ticket-prices-drop-after-shock-at-400-seats-west-end
5/12/2022,"I read George Monbiot’s piece on soil (The secret world beneath our feet is mind-blowing – and the key to our planet’s future, 7 May) and was impressed by both the poetry and the factuality of his plea to protect it. Indeed, yes, if we lose this, then the future of humankind is well and truly compromised. But once again we are presented with various hi-tech or alternative magic bullets (in this case “fermentation” and “stockfree organic”). This is the same as with climate change, where various tech fixes are also given centre stage more often than not. I am not saying that we shouldn’t be investigating innovative solutions, but we should also make a point of holding on to tried-and-tested ways. Yes, chemical-intensive, monoculture production is destined to eventually fail, but if we only look for super-innovative solutions and those turn out not to deliver, then we will be really stuck. As it is, old seed types and old methods of production are dying out or fading from memory. My suggestion is that we hold on to that, reserving at least one-third of production for traditional methods. Then, if the magic bullet fails, we still have the old ways to fall back on. But I am not hopeful. I see a scenario where intensively farmed crops fail, the magic bullets don’t work, and the only knowledge that we have is cloud computing and internet algorithms.

5/12/2022,"The war in Ukraine is fuelling a surge in money transfers to the country as migrant workers and refugees fleeing the conflict scramble to send financial support back to their families. The World Bank said remittances to Ukraine from other countries were expected to rise by more than 20% this year, driven by Ukrainians abroad transferring funds back to friends and family facing the severe economic impact of the Russian invasion. Meanwhile the flow of funds from Russia to countries in central Asia, from where it draws millions of migrant workers, is expected to suffer a dramatic decline as western sanctions plunge Russia into the deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Remittances are payments sent from one person to another in a different country, typically by migrant workers sending money back to their families. The World Bank said the surge in cross-border payments to Ukraine mirrored a trend typically seen after natural disasters, as refugees and migrant workers scrambled to support friends and family. The biggest increases came from Poland, the largest recipient of Ukrainian migrant workers, and, to some extent, the US. Even before Vladimir Putin’s invasion Ukraine was the biggest recipient of remittances in Europe and central Asia, with record-high inflows of $18.2bn (£14.8bn) last year. However, money flows are expected to surge in 2022 by 20% from the level in 2021 due to the impact of war. The World Bank said total global remittance flows to low-and middle-income countries were expected to grow by 4.2% to reach $630bn this year. While Ukraine is expected to record a surge, the organisation said countries with close ties to Russia would probably suffer a sharp fall in remittances due to the impact of western sanctions on the country’s economy – forecast to shrink by 11% this year – and ability of Russians to send money abroad. Furthermore, with the country’s biggest banks limited from accessing the global financial system, remittance outflows from Russia could plummet by 40%. The World Bank said this would have a damaging impact on central Asian countries with exceptionally tight links to Russia that rely on remittances for a large share of overseas currency earnings, including Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Uzbekistan. In Kyrgyzstan, where 82% of remittances originated in Russia in 2021, flows this year are likely to plunge by 32%, compared with an original projected growth rate of 3%. Major payments companies including Visa and Mastercard have blocked services in Russia, while providers such as PayPal and Revolut have waived fees on transfers to Ukraine in support of the country. The World Bank said average remittance fees for sending funds to Ukraine ranged between 4.7% in Hungary to 7% in the Czech Republic last year, while steps to reduce charges by 2 percentage points could save Ukrainian migrants over $400m. The institution said rising food, fertiliser and oil prices triggered by Russia’s invasion were likely to increase risks to food security and exacerbate poverty in many low-income countries around the world. Michal Rutkowski, global director of the social protection and jobs global practice at the World Bank, said: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered large-scale humanitarian, migration and refugee crises and risks for a global economy that is still dealing with the impact of the Covid pandemic. “Boosting social protection programmes to protect the most vulnerable, including Ukrainians and families in central Asia, as well as those affected by the war’s economic impact, is a key priority to protect people from the threats of food insecurity and rising poverty.”",News/World news,War leads to surge in money transfers to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/ukraine-russia-war-money-transfers-surge-world-bank
5/12/2022,"Trevor Foster, 26, loved the Cowboys, the Yankees, fishing, animals and above all his daughter. Jarod Galloway, 21, wanted people to be the best version of themselves, and his niece was his favorite human. Taylor Miller, 27, was a nursing student and a staunch supporter of anyone in recovery. Michael Stabile, 15, was ending his freshman year with great grades and a promotion at the restaurant where he worked. Jared Tyler Olvera, 20, always befriended the new kids at school. Jordan Humphrey, 21, loved sneakers, cars and his family, who loved him “as big as the sky”. All were among US overdose deaths in 2021, a record year for such fatalities with an estimated 107,622, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday. It was an increase of 15% from the previous year, which was also a record. The US has now passed 1m overdose deaths since the CDC began collecting data about two decades ago. The surge in deaths in 2021 was fueled primarily by fentanyl, a highly dangerous synthetic opioid that accounted for about 70% of fatalities. Black American men and boys have the highest fatality rates from drug overdoses, followed closely by American Indian and Alaska Native men and boys – a significant increase among these demographics in recent years. Overdose deaths among teens have doubled in the past three years, even though drug use is decreasing overall among teens. Teens are more likely to buy pills they think are Adderall, Xanax or Percocet, seeking help in studying for exams, calming anxiety, helping sleep, or treating pain, said Dr Nora D Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (Nida) at the National Institutes of Health. “They’ve been doing this for decades. What is now different is these prescription drugs that are illicitly manufactured containing fentanyl have increased fiftyfold,” Volkow said. The almost fiftyfold increase in illicit pills containing fentanyl happened between 2018 and 2021, she said – a “huge proliferation”. One-time and casual users, including children, are dying. “They were poisoned by taking a pill that contains something that they did not know was there,” Volkow said. Cameron March, 23, was a Sacramento Kings basketball fan, one of 10 children in a bustling blended family. From a friend, he bought two pills he thought were Percocet. He had struggled with anxiety and depression since middle school and he had bought pills before. This time, the pills, pressed to look like real prescription medication, contained twice the lethal dose of fentanyl. On 11 August 2021, March never woke up. “He didn’t really know how it’s everywhere,” said his mother, Lisa Ezell. “He just didn’t know. “It’s completely devastating. That one missing person is just so glaringly obvious – his presence is so greatly missed.” Cameron’s older siblings are stricken with grief and his younger siblings can’t comprehend why someone would “put poison in a pill and give it to him”, his mother said. Volkow said: “We as a nation have to say, ‘What is it that we can do to avoid that [increase in deaths] happening again?’ What is it that we’re doing wrong?” Drug overdoses are particularly tragic because they are entirely preventable, Volkow said. Opioid overdoses can be reversed with naloxone. Schools and parents, Volkow said, need to reach out to kids to educate them on the dangers of fentanyl, and medical providers can screen for drug use in teenagers or the presence of an underlying mental disorder, like anxiety or depression. Offering social support can also make a huge difference. “Isolation, feeling that actually nobody cares for you, is one of the factors that increases risk – that you don’t have alternatives in your life, that you’re not doing well at school, that you feel very, very depressed and nobody seems to care,” Volkow said. “This is a disease of distress. So what are the support systems that we need to provide to people to contain this very dangerous use of drugs?” Harm reduction is also an important part of stemming the tide of deaths, Volkow said. That includes the widespread distribution of naloxone, which is extremely easy to use in the inhalable form known as Narcan. “It’s a no-brainer,” Volkow said. Offering substance use treatment options, distributing test strips to detect the presence of fentanyl, offering needle exchanges and safe injection sites, and ensuring a safe, uncontaminated supply of substances for those who continue using are also important steps for addressing the epidemic of overdose deaths. Many of those who die from overdoses are young, Volkow said. “They are in the most productive years of their life. Many of them have families and children, and all of them are left behind.” Overdose can strike anyone, even the first time they take a contaminated pill. “It’s not a drug addict problem,” Lisa Ezell said. “It could be a one-time thing at a party, or your kid has a toothache or a back problem and they get a pill from a friend.” She wants officials to hold people accountable, and to do everything they can to spread the word about the epidemic sweeping the US. “There’s so many people dying and nothing’s being done,” she said.",News/US news,‘Completely devastating’: US passes 1m overdose deaths since records began,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/us-overdose-deaths-total-data
