12/21/2021,"The new week kicked off on a negative note, as all 3 major indexes pulled back from record highs. The uncertainty about the COVID-19 Omicron variant cast a pall over investors already cautious about the impact of rising inflation. But according to RBC chief US equity strategist Lori Calvasina, investors shouldn’t get too worked up. In fact, Calvasina takes a guardedly optimistic view of 2022. At the bottom line, Calvasina writes, “We continue to expect 2022 to be a year of solid but more moderate returns in the S&P 500 than what we’ve experienced in 2021.” But how she gets there commands some interest. Calvasina notes, “Most of our economic tests suggest that the S&P 500 should end up north of 5,100 – a reminder that the strong economy that empowers the Fed to move should ultimately win out.” That would suggest a 12% gain on the S&P index; while significantly lower than this year’s 21% gain, it’s definitely enough to keep investors in the black. With that outlook in mind, RBC has tapped two high-yield dividend stocks (yielding 9% or better) as Buying propositions going into 2022. While these are usually defensive portfolio positions, dividend stocks do have the advantage of ensuring an income stream no matter what the market conditions. Let's take a closer look. Annaly Capital Management (NLY) The first of RBC’s picks that we’ll check out is Annaly Capital, a real estate investment trust (REIT). This is a logical place to look for high-yield dividends, as REITs have a history of offering outsized dividends; Annaly is simply typical in that respect. In other respects, however, it is not so common. The company is mortgage REIT, meaning its portfolio is composed of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, rather than direct ownership of real estate. The company is one of the largest mortgage REITs in the business. Annaly boasts a market cap of $11.2 billion and has $94 billion in total assets, which include $14 billion in permanent capital and $9.8 billion in unencumbered assets. The company’s investment portfolio is split, 70% in long-term fixed-rate agency investment and 30% in shorter-term credit. Looking at Annaly’s recent performance, we see that in Q3, ‘earnings available for distribution’ (EAD) came in at 28 cents per share. This was down 2 cents from the prior quarter, and down 4 cents from the year-ago quarter – but it was more than enough to cover the 22-cent common share dividend payout. The dividend payment declared on December 9 for Q4, with payment set for January 31. At that rate, the dividend annualizes to 88 cents and gives an impressive dividend yield of 11%. This should be enough to attract investors, as divided yields across the broader markets are currently averaging just 1.3%. Markets are looking at changes in the near future, of the type that are likely to impact a mortgage REIT like Annaly. Specifically, the Federal Reserve is going to pull back its easy money policies (start the so-called taper), and likely raise rates in the bargain. Getting ready for those shifts, RBC's Kenneth Lee believes that Annaly is well-prepared. He writes of the company: “NLY continues to increase capital allocation towards credit assets, ahead of a Fed taper, and gradually build up its MSR portfolio, which could be a benefit in a rising rate environment. Management continues to take a conservative posture, with the ability to take advantage of any investment opportunities in the n-t. We continue to favor NLY's diversified operating model and ability to pivot between attractive opportunities.” In line with his optimistic take, Lee rates NLY an Outperform (i.e. Buy). Lee's $9.50 price target conveys his confidence in NLY's ability to climb 23% higher by the end of 2022. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~34% potential total return profile. (To watch Lee’s track record, click here) Overall, the analyst consensus here is a Moderate Buy, based on 8 reviews that include 3 Buys and 5 Holds. The stock’s average price target of $8.86 suggests ~15% upside from the current share price of $7.72. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks) Chimera Investment Corporation (CIM) The second dividend stock, to round out our look at RBC’s picks, is another REIT, Chimera investment. Like Annaly, Chimera is a mortgage REIT, with a portfolio of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Chimera’s investments are mainly in residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage-backed securities, and asset securitization. The company currently manages over $16 billion in assets. Over the past four quarters, Chimera has seen revenues stabilize between $220 million and $280 million, after higher volatility during the corona crisis of the previous four quarters. The most recent financial report, for 3Q21, showed $220 million at the top line. EPS was positive, and while it was down from Q2, the 42 cents reported as ‘earnings available for distribution’ beat the forecast by 6 cents, or 16%, and was up 27% year-over-year. The earnings beat wasn’t the only good news. With 42 cents per share available, the company was easily able to afford the 33-cent per common share dividend payment. The dividend yields 9%, based on its $1.32 annualized payment. The company has a reliable dividend payment history going back to 2007. Once again, RBC's Kenneth Lee is bullish, writing: “Favorable loan pricing drove meaningful book value accretion in the quarter. Mgmt continues to believe seasoned RPLs [reperforming loans] represent an attractive investment opportunity. Strong housing market fundamentals remain supportive of favorable mortgage credit performance.” Lee’s comments support his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and he gives the stock an $18 price target that indicates room for a 12-month upside of ~26%. There are only 2 recent reviews of this stock; Lee’s on the bullish side, and another on the Hold side. This gives CIM a Moderate Buy rating. With the stock’s price listing at $14.34, the average price target of $18 – matching Lee’s – suggests a one-year upside potential of ~26%.

12/21/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Trinity Smith lost her home in Detroit because of unfairly high property taxes—and in the process, she handed over thousands of dollars to a multibillion-dollar money machine that benefits real estate speculators, big banks and the county government that foreclosed on her. Most Read from Bloomberg Moderna’s Third Dose Boosts Antibodies Against Omicron S&P 500 Set for Biggest Three-Day Drop Since May: Markets Wrap South Africa Hospitalization Rate Plunges in Omicron Wave London Hospitalizations Surge; EU Clears Novavax: Virus Update Europe Braces for More Covid Lockdowns as U.K. Cases Surge Smith’s home was one of more than 100,000 that officials have auctioned off over the past decade in Wayne County, Michigan, which has transformed delinquent property taxes into investment opportunities. Since 2005, county officials have used the debts to back roughly $3.5 billion in bond sales—securities that pay high yields to investors and are funded by penalties, fines and foreclosure sales like Trinity Smith’s. While issuing these so-called Delinquent Tax Anticipation Notes, or DTANs, the county has done well for itself, collecting hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue beyond the actual tax debts. Meanwhile, Smith, who lost her entire investment in the house as part of the 2013 foreclosure, is still grappling with the consequences. “I haven’t been able to get myself back mentally,” she said in a recent interview, wiping away tears. Wayne County is an extreme example of a nationwide phenomenon: Local officials use fines and foreclosures or tax lien sales as cudgels against people who haven’t paid their property taxes—even though flawed tax assessments have systematically inflated tax bills for the lowest priced homes. Some municipalities’ efforts to securitize or sell the debts have led to a broad, upward transfer of wealth that’s rooted in fundamentally unfair tax systems. New York City, where a Bloomberg News investigation found profound systemic unfairness in property taxes, has recouped billions by rolling tax liens into trusts and selling bonds, a practice that generates millions in fees for finance professionals. New York’s attorney general has recommended overhauling the practice, citing a “disproportionate impact” on minority homeowners. And in Texas, a financial firm cofounded by a billionaire has taken a private-sector approach to financializing property-tax debt, purchasing and bundling more than 35,000 municipal liens worth nearly $300 million into securities to sell on Wall Street. Nationwide data show that much of the debt that’s being sold never should have existed in the first place. Across the U.S., local governments collect roughly $500 billion in residential property taxes each year by applying a set tax rate to the market value of every home, making it vitally important to assess each property’s value accurately. But in county after county, studies show that unfair valuations shift the tax burden from high-priced homes to low-priced ones. Some local officials have acknowledged the problem, citing causes that include the challenge of ascertaining the condition—and thus, the value—of thousands of individual homes. But if the causes are complex, the effects are simple: Families who have been unfairly taxed get caught in a vicious cycle of debt, and many lose their best chance at building wealth. See also: How Unfair Property Taxes Keep Black Families From Gaining Wealth King Smith was 11 years old when the men came to put him and his mother, Trinity, out of their two-story home in Detroit’s Rosedale Park neighborhood. He recalls his friends looking on as the workers piled their possessions on the curb. His Playstation went missing. Later, he’d learn that animal control had taken his two dogs. “That was the childhood I was supposed to have,” says King, now 16, “but it was taken away from me.” The Smiths moved from a street with wide lawns and a canopy of trees, eventually landing in a one-story house on a block that’s pocked with abandoned properties. Trinity Smith had purchased their home in 2011 for $22,500, but Detroit officials valued it at $85,000 for tax purposes that year. She’d applied for a property-tax exemption under a local program for low-income families, she says, and she never received a bill or any other official notice from the city. Regardless, county records show, the house racked up more than $6,000 in unpaid taxes in just a few years’ time. Her first clue about the tax debt came in 2013, when she got a call from a company offering to buy her home; the caller mentioned the past-due amount and told her she was in danger of losing her place to foreclosure. Smith rushed to the Wayne County Treasurer’s office, where she discovered that that her property sat on two separate tax parcels. While that’s not uncommon, it had caused a mix-up with her exemption paperwork, she says. She filed for an extension and sought aid from a social-service agency. But by that time, the county had already foreclosed. The next year, the Smiths’ house became one of more than 23,000 homes that county officials auctioned off; it fetched a price of $39,000. Trinity and King Smith lost everything. Others gained. First, Wayne County used their tax debt and thousands of others to back its 2014 issue of DTANs. The two- to three-year notes were attractive to underwriters and investors; in an era of historically low interest rates, they offered yields that were as much as six times higher than similarly rated debt, county records and market data show. Among the largest institutional holders of the bonds were Bank of New York Mellon, a handful of insurance companies and a rural electric cooperative association. Since 2017, Wayne County has offered DTANs through private placements, and as of this year, it had sold roughly $617 million privately. County records show that roughly $500 million of those notes were purchased by JPMorgan Chase & Co. A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment for this story. Bondholders weren’t the only beneficiaries when the Smiths lost their home. It sold for $39,000 in October 2014, far more than Trinity Smith’s $6,358 tax debt—and Wayne County pocketed the difference for a five-fold return on the unpaid taxes. For years, Wayne County and at least seven other counties in Michigan have routinely auctioned off foreclosed homes for amounts that exceeded the homes’ tax debts and kept the difference. Last year, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the practice constitutes an unconstitutional “taking” of private property. Thus far, none of the Michigan counties have agreed to reimburse people like Trinity Smith; five class action lawsuits have been certified. “It was just shocking to me that governments were treating people like they don’t really own their property,” says Christina Martin, an attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian public-interest law firm that led the team that secured the state Supreme Court ruling. “They have a right to seize property to get paid for what they are owed, but they don’t have the right to keep anything more than that.” The group has challenged similar practices across the country, Martin said, including in Nebraska, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Minnesota. In Michigan, Martin said, “it quickly became apparent that this practice was being used by some treasurers as a way to boost their budgets.” Since 2005, Wayne County’s delinquent tax program and its foreclosures have generated roughly $715 million in revenue beyond the taxes that were owed, audited financial reports show, and the county has transferred almost $600 million from the program into its general fund. In a written response to questions, Wayne County Treasurer Eric Sabree said that the county operates the delinquent tax program “in accordance with Michigan law” and that transfers to the county’s general fund “are also mandated by state law.” He added, “We are continuously analyzing and evaluating any impact of the Michigan Supreme Court ruling” and “related litigation is ongoing.” The investor who bought the Smiths’ home also got some advantages. After buying it for $39,000 in 2014 and letting Trinity and King Smith stay for a while, the investor flipped it in 2017 for $120,000, property records show. That year, city assessors valued it at just $47,000 for tax purposes—about 39% of its market value. When Trinity Smith bought it in 2011, assessors had valued the place at 377% of its market price. Such “regressive” assessments—meaning those that burden people at the low end of the economic scale more than people at the high end—were responsible for at least 25% of Detroit’s foreclosures of the lowest-priced homes, according to a 2019 study. One of the study’s authors, Bernadette Atuahene, a law professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology, co-founded a group that’s fighting to suspend foreclosures until Detroit addresses flaws in its assessments. In a paper last year, Atuahene cited systemic flaws in the city’s assessments and the high volume of foreclosures in calling Detroit a “predatory city.” She suggested that other cities across the U.S. might also deserve the title. “There are a lot of people making money at various levels,” Atuahene said. “The people profiting are doing what’s perfectly legal, but they are allowing a predatory system built off illegally high assessments.” See also: How a $2 Million Condo in Brooklyn Ends Up With a $157 Tax Bill Foreclosures are far rarer in New York City, where property tax debts have backed more than $2 billion in bonds since 1996; the most recent batch was sold Dec. 17. Because the city operates a highly regressive property tax system that shifts hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from higher- to lower-priced properties each year, many homeowners still wind up losing. Kevin B. Rose discovered as much after his father died in 2012. Lyndon Rose left behind the family home in the Bronx, where unpaid property taxes began piling up. By the time Kevin Rose realized what was happening, he had a heap of foreclosure warnings to sort through and a tax debt that was approaching $10,000 at interest rates as high as 18%. (In 2019, officials cut the top interest rate to 7% for properties like the Roses’.) Feeling overwhelmed, he sold the house in April 2016 for $260,000. That sale price was $80,000 less than the value that city officials had attached to the house two months earlier, city records show, resulting in an annual tax bill of about $3,900. Based on the actual sale price, that’s an effective tax rate of 1.5%—far higher than the median rate of 0.9% for the Bronx. (The buyer got to work rehabbing the Roses’ former home a month later, city records show, and resold the property in 2017 for $442,568. That year, city officials set its value for tax purposes at $370,000.) “It’s incredible, it’s unbelievable,” Kevin Rose says of the experience. “They know that people like my father, he may not have a support group, a lawyer who can look this stuff over. They take advantage of your ignorance, your lack of options.” He didn’t know it, but a chunk of the tax bill went to investors as well. Each year, New York City officials collect about $30 billion in property taxes and set up a trust to handle a comparatively tiny $75 million worth of taxes that haven’t been paid, on average. Officials transfer liens—or official, binding claims they’ve filed against properties for unpaid bills—into each trust, which then issues bonds to investors. Liens on roughly 7,000 properties were eligible for the most recent sale, city data show. Companies hired to recoup the debt earn 1% of the trust’s assets as a base fee. Bonuses climb as they collect more; their payments can reach $3 million for larger trusts. For several years, New York’s trusts have given this collection work to South Carolina-based MTAG Services and New Jersey-based Tower Capital Management. MTAG executives didn’t respond to requests for comment, and an executive at Tower said all inquiries should be directed to New York’s finance department. In an email, a department spokesman said the system has advantages over traditional enforcement efforts, including a decreased chance of foreclosure. “The tax lien sale has been an effective enforcement tool to maintain a high level of voluntary compliance with property taxes,” the spokesman said. “The program is designed to prompt property owners to pay delinquent taxes and charges. It is not a blunt instrument that charts a one-way path to foreclosure.” Those who buy the trusts’ bonds—typically, institutional investors like insurers and banks—get remarkably safe bets and yields that surpass U.S. treasuries. The bonds generally receive AAA scores, and for good reason: Tax liens get “super-priority” in the case of a defaults; lien holders get paid even before mortgage lenders. Moreover, the value of a New York tax lien, on average, is about 10% of the property’s value, which tends to give owners an incentive to pay instead of simply walking away. New York’s commitment to tax lien trusts may be waning. Officials didn’t create one for 2020, citing the Covid-19 pandemic. In an October letter, New York Attorney General Letitia James had called on outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio to forgo creating one this year too, describing the prospect as “alarming.” Critics say the trusts exacerbate displacement and gentrification, a societal cost that they consider too high. De Blasio’s incoming successor, Eric Adams, has said he plans to end the trusts. Even Keith Sernick, who cofounded one of the companies that collects debt for them, says their time has probably passed. “They’d be better off if they just did an open auction” to sell off tax liens without securitizing them, says Sernick, who now runs an economic development firm. “Because securitizations are very expensive. And the guys who do the securitization make tons of money.” Meanwhile, a company in Texas has demonstrated that the private sector can accomplish pretty much the same process. In 2014, Propel Financial Services bundled $141 million of Texas tax debt into a trust that sold securities backed by it; and in 2017, after expanding its reach to seven more states, it launched another, with $137 million worth of notes. Propel mostly built those trusts one lien at a time, by going directly to delinquent homeowners, often via direct mail or online marketing campaigns. In effect, the company pays off the homeowners’ back taxes, creating new loans that are still secured by the liens against their property. For borrowers, the appeal can be hard to resist: They exchange thousands of dollars in public tax debt for comparatively manageable monthly payments. But the new debts can add up quickly. Initial fees can add $600 or more to the principal, and interest accrues at rates of 13.9% and higher, according to contracts reviewed by Bloomberg. If borrowers pay down their debts on schedule, they’ll typically have paid more than double the face value of their tax liens. “This is one of my babies that I intend to grow into a very competitive financial services company,” Propel cofounder Red McCombs told the San Antonio Business Journal in March 2018. “In two to three years, it will be a $100 million business.” McCombs, a billionaire, built his wealth on car dealerships and Clear Channel Communications, the media company. Propel executives didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment for this article. Back in Detroit, prospects are looking up for some property tax debtors. The Gilbert Family Foundation has pledged $15 million to pay off the debts for 20,000 Detroit homeowners on fixed incomes. The foundation was established by billionaire Dan Gilbert, founder of Detroit-based Quicken Loans, now known as Rocket Mortgage, and his wife Jennifer. As of September, the property-tax program aided about 1,600 households. A 2020 state law, pushed by local community groups, drastically reduced back taxes for those who receive poverty exemptions from the county. Trinity Smith would have qualified. But for her family, like tens of thousands of others, the aid came too late. Detroit officials have acknowledged overtaxing about 130,000 homeowners between 2010 and 2013. Recent research shows that the city’s system remains deeply regressive. King Smith is now a junior in high school. A star wide receiver on his high school football team, he is working to keep his grades up and looking forward to college. A scholarship would come in handy; his mother, Trinity, says she spent much of his college fund in a futile attempt to hold on to their old home. She’s working part-time now as a contractor for Amazon, delivering packages at night. Sometimes the job takes her back to her old neighborhood. “That’s when I feel like I didn’t do everything I could have to keep that house,” she says. “It was wealth. I thought I could pass it along to him someday. But then I realize this is big business. They wanted my house, and they took it.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek How McDonald’s Made Enemies of Black Franchisees A Fight to Die What Is Company Culture If You Don’t Have an Office?

12/21/2021,"Rivian (RIVN) stock has had quite a ride since going public, increasing 61% before crashing back down whilst shedding 46% of its value. The drop came on account of the company’s first earnings report as a public entity. Rivian delivered 11 R1Ts in the quarter which resulted in total revenue of about $1 million. The company's lofty valuation, however, has less to do with present sales and is based on the electric truck startup’s promise. Here the Street appeared disappointed to learn of a slower-than-expected zoom out of the gates. The company was targeting production of 1,200 vehicles in 2021 but said it expects to fall short of that figure by a few hundred and has attributed the softness to that very 2021 bogeyman - temporary bottlenecks. Additionally, assembling the complex battery module used in the vehicles has proved a challenge (each battery pack has 9 modules and a highly automated process). However, Deutsche Bank’s Emmanuel Rosner is unperturbed by these snags. “While Rivian’s ramp-up issues will result in fewer vehicles delivered in 2021,” said the analyst, “They sounded temporary in nature and seem to have already been largely addressed.” In fact, the analyst is buoyed by other positive developments. As of December 15, management said pre-order reservations for R1 vehicles had reached 71,000, up from the end of October’s 55,000, and which have led management to consider price increases. Rosner counts raised brand awareness from the blockbuster IPO and the R1T being named Motor Trend’s 2022 “Truck of the Year” as the reasons why the company is gaining “accelerated traction with consumers.” The company also announced it had found the Georgia location for its 2nd manufacturing plant. The State has granted Rivian some “generous incentives” which could help capex come in below prior expectations. Although Rosner reduced his Q4 deliveries and earnings estimates, the analyst sticks to his 2022 forecasts and remains a fully-fledged RIVN bull. “We continue to believe the company offers a particularly well thought-out business plan to become a large and profitable EV player, with unique characteristics in both hardware and software, and applying lessons from previous efforts by other players,” the analyst summed up. To this end, Rosner rates RIVN shares a Buy, backed by a $130 price target. If correct, investors could be lining their pockets with ~41% gain. (To watch Rosner’s track record, click here) The Street’s overall price target is just a touch higher; at $134.64, the figure implies the stock will be changing hands for ~48% premium a year from now. Rating wise, 4 analysts are skeptics but all 10 other ratings are to Buy, culminating in a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

12/21/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- An exceptional year for wealthy Americans, at least in terms of their financial health, just got better. Most Read from Bloomberg Moderna’s Third Dose Boosts Antibodies Against Omicron S&P 500 Has Biggest Three-Day Drop Since September: Markets Wrap Billy Joel NYC Show Going Ahead; Quebec Closures: Virus Update Europe Braces for More Covid Lockdowns as U.K. Cases Surge South Africa Hospitalization Rate Plunges in Omicron Wave If West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin votes against President Joe Biden’s signature economic package, as he said he would on Sunday, rich Americans will escape any tax hikes, saving the top 0.1% hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. “To say my clients were celebrating is the wrong word to use,” said Steven Winter, a partner at BDO who primarily advises hedge funds and private equity firms. “It was a sigh of relief.” Democrats had designed a $1.75 trillion bill aimed at narrowing the widening wealth gap by enhancing tax credits for children and low-income adults while raising revenue from the wealthy and corporations. The latest bill’s three most expensive items for the super-wealthy, including a surtax on incomes above $10 million, would raise more than $640 billion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. ‘Meaningful Step’ Though many of Democrats’ more radical tax proposals were scaled back or dropped in negotiations, the bill would be “a meaningful step for reducing inequality,” said Carl Davis, research director at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. An analysis by the group estimated the plan’s changes to the child tax credit and earned income tax credit would boost incomes of the poorest fifth of Americans by more than 10%. Without passing the bill, known as Build Back Better, Biden is unlikely to achieve his often-stated goal of leveling the economic playing field between the wealthy and everyone else. “We’re going to reward work, not just wealth,” he told Congress when he unveiled the package in April. “I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.” Republicans, who uniformly oppose Biden’s bill, were gleeful that it might fail. “The single biggest Christmas present Washington Democrats could give to the American people is to kill their reckless taxing and spending spree,” Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said in a tweet. The pandemic has accelerated inequality, with the top 1% now controlling more than 32% of U.S. wealth, the highest since at least the late 1980s according to Federal Reserve estimates. While their share is up 2.4 points since the start of 2020, the portion of wealth held by the middle class, the 50th to 99th percentiles, has dipped. One bright spot is that pandemic relief has helped the poorest half of U.S. households boost their savings a bit. The bottom 50% of Americans now hold 2.5% of U.S. wealth, up 0.7 points since the start of 2020 and the highest share since 2004. Massive Windfalls Meanwhile, the very richest Americans have reaped massive windfalls. The net worths of Americans on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the world’s 500 richest people, have surged 45% since the beginning of last year. The 169 U.S. billionaires on the list are now worth $3.5 trillion, more than the bottom half of Americans combined. Against this backdrop, the wealthy were prepared for the worst from Biden and Democrats. But lawmakers were forced to drop proposals to almost double the top rate on capital gains, close loopholes like the carried interest rules benefiting private equity managers, and make it harder to pass large amounts of wealth to heirs tax-free. “Much of what gave alarm to high-net-worth individuals was already out” of the latest versions of the bill, said Bill Smith, managing director of CBIZ MHM’s national tax office. “Most of the concern had already withered.” Advisers to the wealthy aren’t resting easy, however. Many, including BDO’s Winter, suspect Democrats might eventually reach a deal on a pared-back package. With so much uncertainty, he said, “it makes it literally impossible to take any pre-emptive steps” to avoid taxes and be sure they’ll work. Still, rich Americans have been in a hurry to complete transactions before the end of the year, trying to lock in the current rates and enjoy loopholes while they still can. U.S. billionaires, for example, were selling stock at more than twice the rate as last year, ensuring those sales weren’t subject to the proposed surtax, a 5% levy on incomes over $10 million and an additional 3% tax on those above $25 million, slated to go into effect in 2022. IRS Funding Also threatened by Manchin’s announcement are plans for a significant funding increase for the Internal Revenue Service. The agency’s rate of auditing the wealthy has plunged due to budget cuts, a trend “that sends a message to people that they can do as they please with very little risk of consequences,” said Jay Soled, a Rutgers University professor and tax attorney. Despite the latest roadblocks to the bill, advisers said many of their clients are still rushing to finish things off by the end of the year, just in case. And there may even be new opportunities to pass on wealth to heirs. With the bill delayed until at least next year, Lathrop GPM partner Marya Robben said clients are “ready to move” on setting up grantor-retained annuity trusts, or GRATs. Such vehicles get around the estate and gift tax by letting heirs profit from the appreciation in assets they don’t own. Recent market declines and the prospect of higher interest rates make GRATs a more attractive strategy, she said. Provisions to shut down the GRAT loophole weren’t included in the latest version of the bill. No Rush Manchin’s opposition is most significant for those who “were hesitant” or running late on taking steps to transfer wealth to heirs, said Laura Zwicker, chair of the private client services group at Los Angeles law firm Greenberg Glusker. “Senator Manchin’s announcement makes it likely that clients will not want to rush into planning in 2021 and to take a bit more time to think about their transactions,” she said. If Democrats can’t strike a deal soon, it could be several years before they have any chance of changing tax rules, said Rutgers’ Soled. “Embedded in the code there are provisions where people are not paying their fair share,” he said. “These are systemic issues that are exacerbating inequality.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek What Is Company Culture If You Don’t Have an Office?
