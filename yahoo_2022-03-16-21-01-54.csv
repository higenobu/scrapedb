3/16/2022,"Some of the most well-known oil stocks have further room to run amid elevated oil and gas prices, says strategists at Goldman Sachs. And they point to several fundamental factors for their ongoing bullishness. ""We continue to believe upstream energy companies are favorably set-up in the current commodity upcycle (1) to generate double-digit free cash flow, which should allow for attractive capital returns and/or balance sheet improvement and thus allow for shares to outperform; (2) to undergo favorable consensus revisions in 2022 (we see 42% upside to consensus operating cash flows and 57% upside to EPS); and (3) given attractive valuation at our long-term Brent oil price of $90/bbl (vs. $80/bbl prior) despite our expectations for higher incremental inflation. Given the highly volatile commodity price environment, we continue to recommend a beta barbell strategy and prefer companies where we see dislocations on valuation relative to asset quality and where higher free cash flow from the current upcycle can drive greater capital returns relative to consensus expectations,"" explains Goldman Sachs' Neil Mehta. Goldman lists 12 oil stocks it's particularly locked in on: Hess (HES), Ovintiv (OVV), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), ConocoPhillips (COP), Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY), PDC Energy (PDCE), Antero Resources (AR), Kosmos Energy (KOS), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Coterra Energy (CTRA), and EQT Corp. (EQT). The investment bank notes these 12 stocks have average upside potential of 32% and a forward dividend yield of 4%. Traders may not be too shocked to see Goldman's calls here. Oil prices are off their highs of nearly $139 a barrel on optimism U.S. oil majors such as Exxon and Chevron will produce more to make up for any lost Russian output amidst its war on Ukraine. Even still, oil prices remain above $100 a barrel reflecting the geopolitical risk. Some on the Street have warned recently that oil prices could still surge to $200 a barrel. Berkshire Hathaway billionaire Warren Buffett has been scooping up shares of Occidental Petroleum this month as oil prices have soared. Says Mehta on the move in Occidental, ""At our bullish commodity prices in 2022 estimate, we expect the company to generate ~$20 billion in free cash flow (37% of market cap before including the dilution impact from the warrants), which should allow for $3 billion in share repurchase + fixed dividend (~6% capital returns yield) and potential for further debt reduction. We continue to see potential for greater investor credit towards the company’s Upstream, Chemical and Low Carbon assets as Occidental continues to delever.""

3/16/2022,"By Elaine Lies TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese accountant Masamitsu has not travelled or gone to the cinema in years and rarely eats out. Instead, his annual salary of about $34,000 goes to support his family and has risen by just $4 a year for nearly a decade. ""I can't save, I have nothing at all put by for my old age. I'll just have to keep on working,"" said the 50-year-old, who declined to give his last name out of concern for his job at a small company that works in event planning. ""After I retire from this company, I'll do anything I can get. Maybe work as a security guard."" Masamitsu's plight mirrors that of many workers at small and medium-sized firms in Japan, where the average salary in 2020 was $38,515, little changed from the 1990s and well below the average of $49,165 in countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has urged profitable companies to boost wages at spring wage negotiations, when managements of blue chip firms meet key unions for talks to fix wages in the coming year, setting a guideline for most other companies. This year's talks are expected to wrap up on Wednesday. Masamitsu, who was trained in accounting at a vocational school, switched jobs at age 43, in a move relatively unusual for Japanese employees, after his previous employer cut salaries. After a long series of unsuccessful interviews, he felt lucky to land his current job, only to be told upfront that raises would be only 500 yen ($4.25) a year for the first decade. ""Given my age, the base pay actually wasn't too bad, there were other places that were lower,"" he said. ""And I was told that after 10 years, it'd go up by 5,000 yen a year."" Masamitsu's monthly pay, along with allowances common in Japan, amounts to about 250,000 yen, and he gets a bonus of two months' pay twice a year for a yearly total of roughly 4 million yen ($34,000). ""It's kind of unfortunate it doesn't rise more, even though I'm working hard,"" he said. From this sum he supports his wife, who works part-time to supplement their income, and a daughter who is just about to complete high school. For recreation, he and some friends do yoga from YouTube videos, though he occasionally buys a one-day gym pass to take yoga classes. ""I'd have liked to have had another child, but the one has taken everything we have,"" he said. He has little hope that Kishida's urging will change much. ""This kind of thing doesn't really reach people in places like me,"" he said. ""Officials say a lot of things that don't really work out.""

3/16/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) - The share price of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc reached $500,000 for the first time on Monday, reflecting the company's status as a defensive stock in a market unsettled by events in Ukraine and rising inflation. Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 10% in 2022, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which has fallen 12%. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's market value is approximately $731 billion, ranking sixth in the United States, and Buffett's 16.2% stake makes him the world's fifth-richest person at $119.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Berkshire generated a record $27.46 billion of operating profit last year, including gains at Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy. It also owns dozens of other businesses, including the fast-growing Clayton Homes mobile home unit and the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. Berkshire specializes in ""on the ground, Main Street-esque business activity,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix, which invests about $4.3 billion and owns Berkshire stock. ""They're big and they're not a tech stock, and investors get comfort from that."" Berkshire shares also slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in 2021, after lagging in 2019 and 2020. They closed up 0.8% on Monday at $493,785. Most Berkshire operating units focus on the United States, and about 77% of its approximately 372,000 employees work there. Among those expanding elsewhere is Dairy Queen, which plans by 2030 to add 600 stores in China, already its largest market outside the United States. Berkshire traded below $20 when Buffett took over the then-struggling textile company in 1965. Its Class B shares are worth about 1/1500th of Class A shares. U.S. companies with larger market capitalizations include Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Tesla Inc. Apple is also Berkshire's largest common stock holding. Berkshire ended 2021 with $146.7 billion in cash, though it has since invested well over $5 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corp as oil prices soared.

3/16/2022,"Ford (F) is taking an unusual approach to battle the ongoing semiconductor crunch afflicting global automakers — doing without them, for the time being. “We are working as hard as we can and offering ways for our customers to get their vehicles sooner during the global semiconductor shortage … Beginning soon, we will offer customers a way to get their Explorer more quickly, too, thanks to a specification change that will keep rear seat heating/air conditioning auxiliary controls up front with the driver,"" Ford told Yahoo Finance in a statement. Buyers will be able to control the rear climate controls from the front seat console, and the company will restore rear-seat passenger control of heating/air conditioning at no cost at a later date, Ford said. In the meantime, customers will receive a price reduction for the issue. In the past when dealing with shortages, Ford and other carmakers, including GM, would build vehicles that were otherwise complete except for a few missing components and have to wait for the parts to come in before shipping the finished products to dealers. This could sometimes take months, causing frustration for not only Ford, but also dealers and buyers. Case in point: The red-hot Ford Bronco, hundreds of which were parked at a Michigan assembly plant, while thousands of reservation holders fumed online while the company waited for chips to arrive. Ford's new tactic could change the modus operandi for traditional automakers by shipping incomplete, though drive-able, vehicles to customers, and retrofitting them down the road. Ford notes in the same statement released today that it has been shipping F-150 pickups without auto stop/start functionality so customers (especially fleet and commercial clients) could receive their trucks sooner. GM has had to ship some of its popular full-size Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups with missing chips used for cylinder de-activation and auto stop start, as well as omitting features like HD radio. The difference here with Ford is GM is not going to retrofit these modules like the auto-start functionality into the Sierra and Silverado. Not surprisingly for some industry watchers, Tesla (TSLA) has been doing this for some time, delivering some models without USB charging ports (and not telling customers in the process), and also shipping some models without power lumbar support in the passenger seat, claiming buyers barely used that feature: Moving lumbar was removed only in front passenger seat of 3/Y (obv not there in rear seats). Logs showed almost no usage. Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used.Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide. Raw materials especially. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2021 Ford's move with these Explorer SUVs comes along the backdrop as the company itself is predicting a shortfall in U.S. vehicle deliveries this year. According to Automotive News, Ford executives told dealers it now see deliveries for the year sliding to 1.66 million vehicles, down from 1.9 million delivered last year. Ford shares were trading lower today, and are down around 24% year to date. —— Pras Subramanian is the senior autos reporter for Yahoo Finance. You can follow him on Twitter and on Instagram.
