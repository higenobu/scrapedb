12/25/2021,"Three former SpaceX engineers have made a pizza-making robot machine. The machine, which can produce a pizza every 45 seconds, will be in operation next year. Stellar Pizza has more than 23 employees who used to work at Elon Musk's company. Stellar Pizza, a robotic restaurant that can churn out a pizza every 45 seconds, is opening in spring next year in Los Angeles. The company was founded in May 2019 by three former SpaceX engineers, Benson Tsai, Brian Langone, and James Wahawisan. Tsai, CEO of Stellar Pizza, spent five years at Elon Musk's company where he designed advanced battery systems for rockets and satellites. He rounded up more than 23 former SpaceX employees to build an automated, touchless pizza-making machine that fits into the back of a truck. Stellar Pizza's robotic machine can make, bake, and top a pizza in under five minutes. First, a ball of homemade pizza dough is put into the machine, where it gets pressed and moulded into a round shape. Once the dough is ready, the machine tops the pizza with sauce and other ingredients. The raw pizza is then inserted into one of four high-temperature ovens in the robotic machine. One of Stellar Pizza's employees is SpaceX's former executive chef, Ted Cizma, who formed the rocket company's Food Service program for staff, per his LinkedIn profile. Cizma teamed up with pizza consultant, Noel Brohner, in an effort to make high-quality and affordable pizzas for Stellar Pizza. The company offers a pepperoni or supreme pizza. Alternatively, customers can build their own pizza with fresh toppings, including onions, bacon, chicken, and olives.

12/25/2021,"The Trump Grill, located inside Trump Tower in New York City, refused to allow a group of vaccine mandate protesters to eat at the restaurant on Thursday after they failed to provide proof of vaccination. In response, the group slammed former President Donald Trump as a ""fraud"" and ""a little hypocritical"" for enforcing the city's indoor dining vaccine mandate, rather than paying the fines associated with defying the requirement, Newsweek reports. While Trump has come around on promoting the COVID-19 vaccines, he's maintained that ""there can't be mandates and all those things."" As he further put it to Fox News this week, ""The mandate will destroy people's lives â€” it destroys people's lives, just as the vaccine saves people."" Trump Hotels, however, says on its website that its Manhattan location requires proof of vaccination ""in accordance with the most recent local government mandate."" While the protesters made their point, one can't help but wonder why they wanted to eat so badly at the ""worst restaurant in America"" in the first place. It's unrealistic to ban football. But it might not be ethical to watch it, either.
