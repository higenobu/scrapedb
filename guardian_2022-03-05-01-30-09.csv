3/5/2022,"A mother and her ex-boyfriend have been found guilty of killing a two-year-old boy after their abuse was caught on secret mobile phone recordings. Kyrell Matthews, from Thornton Heath in south London, had 41 rib fractures and internal bleeding from a 4cm cut to his liver when he was killed on 20 October 2019. The capturing of the abuse on mobile phone recordings has echoes of similar cases in recent months. Sixteen-month-old Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, six, were both killed as a result of physical abuse and, like Kyrell, both children had been referred to social services. Kyrell’s mother, Phylesia Shirley, 24, who had previously worked in children’s services at Croydon council, admitted allowing her son to be harmed but pleaded not guilty to his murder. Her ex-boyfriend, Kemar Brown, 28, who has a number of violence-related convictions, also denied murder. Jurors heard the fractures were caused by a twisting motion and the fatal liver injury was from a kick or punch to the little boy’s stomach. Other injuries were inflicted in at least five separate attacks over 28 days, indicating a significant period of abuse, according to experts. The court also heard distressing mobile phone recordings of both defendants hitting Kyrell, who was non-verbal, on multiple occasions. The audio was secretly recorded by Shirley as she suspected Brown of cheating. On several occasions, Kyrell could be heard being hit repeatedly, with Brown telling him to “shut up”, causing the toddler to cry and scream. In one recording, Brown could be heard beating Kyrell several times before taunting him: “You have to ruin the fun.” Another audio recording captured Shirley hitting her son, making him cry. It was claimed on Brown’s behalf that the jury could not be sure Kyrell was not accidentally killed when Shirley gave him chest compressions, having been wrongly advised in a 111 call to use two hands rather than one. But experts for the prosecution told jurors there were no recorded cases of a child having a such a liver injury from being given CPR, the PA Media news agency reported. The jury heard a recording of Shirley’s 111 call after Kyrell collapsed at home. She sobbed as she was told by a clinical adviser to use both hands and “push down hard and fast” and “go for it”. Brown was found guilty of murder and causing or allowing Kyrell’s death, while Shirley was acquitted of murder but found guilty of manslaughter. Judge Mark Lucraft QC said the court had heard some “harrowing” recordings made by Shirley of the abuse and said she ought to feel “utterly ashamed”. The senior crown prosecutor Samantha Yelland said: “It’s been a horrific case for us all to work on. Kyrell was two – years – old and would not have been able to explain the fear he was feeling, the pain he was feeling to those that cared for him. We are used to dealing with cases of a serious nature on the homicide unit but this one was particularly horrific because of the graphic content of those recordings and because of the defenceless young child who couldn’t do anything to help themselves. “The two people who were supposed to look after him the most were those that caused injury, and in the end his death.” DCI Kate Kieran, of the Metropolitan police, welcomed the verdicts, adding: “I hope that the conviction of both Shirley and Brown today at least gives [Kyrell’s family and friends] some peace in coming to terms with what happened to Kyrell.” She said discovering audio recordings of the child abuse was “unique” and had affected her team. “They are harrowing, there’s no other word for it. I know that the jury have had to listen to them but my investigation team had to listen to them over and over and over again, in order that we could make sure we’ve understood and heard everything on those recordings. “And it’s really affected the team. We all choose to become part of the murder investigation team but I’ve never, ever uncovered evidence like this in one of these cases.” The sentencing hearing is due to take place on 25 March.",News/UK news,"Mother and ex-boyfriend found guilty of killing Kyrell Matthews, two ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/04/mother-and-ex-boyfriend-found-guilty-killing-kyrell-matthews-two
3/5/2022,"International students trapped in a Ukrainian town near the Russian border have made desperate appeals for evacuation, as the number thought to be stranded in Sumy has risen to between 1,200 and 1,500. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, saying they were running out of food and water. “Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure,” she said. Earlier this week it emerged that 500 foreign students were stuck in the city, including almost 400 Nigerians, three Irish students and pupils from Rwanda, Lebanon and Tanzania. But Indian media are reporting that there are between 700 and 1,000 more. Indian medical student Aashik Hussain Sarkar said they witnessed a massive bomb in Friday. “Please evacuate us immediately. More than 1,000 Indians are waiting.” Today they dropped the vacuum bomb in Sumy Region. Everyone from our hostel saw... It was a mushroom shaped explosion with a circular flash. Please evacuate us immediately from here.. more than 1000 Indians are waiting...@PMOIndia @himantabiswa @IAF_MCC @opganga @TeamSOSIndia pic.twitter.com/2vehA0kseF One told the Indian network, NDTV, that they had been waiting on the street for buses to take them to the border when a loud explosion occurred and they rushed to the bunker under their student apartment block. Sumy was still under Ukrainian control, according to the students. A student said: “Right now there is no electricity. There is shortage of water. When we heard that bombardment sound, we just took our passport and we ran into the bunkers. We were really so scared. This time the noise was really really extreme. “We were waiting for a military pass to the border for one-and-a-half hours and at this last moment we heard this noise and we were shifted in here. Now the current situation is the Ukrainian government is now allowing us to travel to the border.” “The explosion was really huge because we felt this in the bunker,” her friend said. The Indian students were all in a single apartment building in Sumy and were reliant on small deliveries of food and water from a local church, said Chandramohan Nallur, an Indian volunteer at the Polish border, helping students stuck in the country. “Luckily I found a contact who used to live in Lviv, they are arranging some food and water through a church,” he said. “There are about 700 in one building. Shelling is still going on; there’s a lot of panic.” Another student said their hopes of rescue were dying, with armed men seen outside their hostel making it unsafe to go out.

3/5/2022,"One of the first non-state funded films of an independent Ukraine, this study of a Ukrainian soldier dealing with the traditional abuse handed out to new recruits in the Soviet army is based on the real-life experiences of director Andrii Donchyk and writer Yurii Andrukhovych. A documentary that started shooting only days after the catastrophic nuclear power plant explosion. Director Volodymyr Shevchenko died of radiation poisoning a month after its release. Shot at the start of the “perestroika” era, this exposed the difficulties of everyday life at a poultry processing factory. Very different from the then standard propaganda film, this depicted a deep social crisis in Soviet society. Documentary about the destruction of the Wall of Memory, the monumental avant-garde reliefs at Kyiv crematorium that artists Ada Rybachuk and Volodymyr Melnychenko had been working on since 1968, after local authorities concreted them over in 1982. Restoration of the artwork finally began in August 2021. A montage of rough video telling the story of the mass demonstrations that took place in Kyiv during the last years of perestroika and the first year of independence in 1991 – in particular, the congress of the People’s Movement of Ukraine. Documentary exploring the activities of the Automaidan movement, a group of activist drivers who used the digital radio channel Varta 1 to briefly patrol the streets of Lviv after the police withdrew in response to the angry protests of February 2014. Sergei Loznitsa’s study of the Revolution of Dignity in Kyiv in 2013 and 2014 that recorded various stages of the protest on a fixed camera. The wide international reach of Loznitsa’s unbiased view of chaotic historical events meant it became one of Euromaidan’s most important documents. A formidable piece of collaborative documentary film-making by a group of second-year students recreating the taut emotional challenges of the experience of directly participating in a revolution. Produced by the artistic collective #BABYLON’13, a collection of footage from the best Ukrainian directors of the new generation asking the audience – in the makers’ words – to “live through three months of protest” together with them. A ground-level study of the revolutionary events of Maidan co-directed by Oleksandr Techinskyi, Aleksey Solodunov and Dmitry Stoykov showing the multi-faceted nature of the revolution, and of Ukrainian society itself. Probably the best known of all Maidan documentaries, an Oscar-nominated film directed by Israeli-American Evgeny Afineevsky that presents a clear narrative of a complex chain of events. It’s been on Netflix since 2015 and has become one of the most widely watched accounts of recent Ukrainian history. Successful documentary about a Donbas family – single mother Hanna and her four children – who hide their war-zone fear behind their passion for playing music and making movies about themselves. A quote from a poem by Paul Éluard forms the film’s title, a perfect metaphor for the surreal world between war and peace. A diary film of personal videos of Ukrainian soldiers who have been defending Donbas since 2014 shows the war in unprecedented close-up. The captions indicate that some of the diarists did not survive the conflict. With a title referring to Dziga Vertov’s 1931 Soviet-worker propaganda film Enthusiasm: The Symphony of Donbas, this archive-montage film by Ihor Minaiev traces the industrial myth of the Donbas from Soviet times through the chaotic 1990s and beyond. Helpful for understanding the background of the occupation of the Donetsk region in 2014 by the Putin regime. Another resistance-cinema product of the #BABYLON’13 collective about the Ukrainian revolution and subsequent war in eastern Ukraine. The title is derived from a phrase one of the film-makers heard: “Your cameras are stronger than arms.” The title alludes to a phrase doctors use to describe soldiers who need help with mental traumas. A film about a female military officer who is undergoing a long rehabilitation as she tries to come to terms with the horrors of war, this is an expansion of the human rights project Invisible Battalion, which campaigns for gender equality in the Ukrainian military. Acclaimed film set in 2025 – a year after Ukraine’s “victory” in the war with Russia – about a former army scout who is part of a humanitarian mission that looks for and exhumes the bodies of dead soldiers. From prominent director Sergei Loznitsa, a kaleidoscope of stories about the conflict in Donbas: a producer for a propaganda TV channel, militiamen searching checkpoints, field commanders posing for journalists, a bandit wedding. Inspired by YouTube videos from Donetsk and Luhansk, this is a study of war and post-truth. One of Ukraine’s highest grossing films tells the story of a Ukrainian battalion’s two-week mission at Donetsk airport in 2014 while it was under attack from pro-Russian militants. Along with the fighting, the soldiers try to comprehend numerous philosophical questions about the nature of war, the enemy and their own identity as Ukrainians. Beautifully resonant drama that reflects on the relations between Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians. One of Mustafa’s son dies in the war in eastern Ukraine and, together with his other son, takes the body to Crimea for burial. It is about the alienation felt when people are excluded from society, from each other and from a whole nation.",Arts/Film,20 of the best films to help understand what’s happening in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/04/20-of-the-best-films-to-help-understand-whats-happening-in-ukraine
3/5/2022,"Covid infection levels are rising in Scotland, figures suggest, as it was confirmed that the UK’s scientific advisers no longer expect to meet regularly to discuss Covid. About one in 19 people in Scotland had Covid in the week ending 26 February, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics based on swabs from randomly selected households. By contrast, infection levels have continued to fall in England and Northern Ireland, with the trend unclear in Wales. About one in 30 people in England are estimated to have had Covid in the week ending 26 February. With infection levels still high across the UK, it was confirmed that the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is not expecting to meet on Covid regularly though it will stand ready if required. Friday’s ONS data reveals that the BA.2 Omicron variant – a “close cousin” of the original BA.1 variant of Omicron but described as “stealth” as it is harder to track – is on the rise in all UK countries except Northern Ireland. The BA.1 variant of Omicron is in decline in all countries except Scotland. Infection levels in Scotland peaked most recently in early January when about one in 18 people had Covid, with levels falling to one in 30 by the middle of the month. Since then they have been rising. The increase appears to be in those around the ages of 30 and 60, with the trend uncertain for children and younger adults. An increase has also been seen in data for confirmed Covid patients in hospital in Scotland: after reaching a peak of 1,571 on 19 January, the figure fell, hitting 868 on 13 February. Since then it has risen to 1,272 Covid patients in hospital in Scotland on 3 March. The uptick has not been reflected in hospital admissions data. However, one expert suggested that may be linked to a data problem. Prof Christina Pagel, director of UCL’s Clinical Operational Research Unit and a member of the Independent Sage group, said it was unclear what was behind the trend in Scotland. “I think the situation in Scotland is quite concerning – they are clearly an outlier in UK with rising cases – by ONS and their dashboard – and rising people in hospital,” she said, adding the decline in the number of people with Covid on their death certificate had also stalled. Pagel suggested there are a number of possible explanations for the trend, including that there may be more people in Scotland who have not previously been infected than in England, meaning BA.2 can spread more easily. Less likely, she said, was that a new subvariant of Omicron was starting to spread. Pagel said another possibility is that a combination of factors such as the waning of protection from boosters, an increase in mixing in the wake of relaxed mitigations, and a rise in BA.2 might be behind the trend. Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, said there were also some early indications in case data for England that Covid could be on the rise, adding that was more likely due to the increase in the more transmissible BA.2 variant . That does not mean Covid measures should return, he said. “Ultimately infections would then shoot up later in the year when vaccine effectiveness has fallen even more,” he said. “But it is another reminder, if one were needed, that we are not out of the woods yet and those people who are more vulnerable to severe disease do need to continue to do things like wear face coverings when in indoor crowded environments and of course go for a booster if and when called.”",News/UK news,"Scotland’s Covid cases rise, while England and N Ireland show falls",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/04/scotland-covid-cases-rise-while-england-and-n-ireland-show-falls
3/5/2022,"There is arguably a calculated safety in staging a revival of this heart-wrenching Windrush generation story of war, love, migration and racial prejudice. Based on Andrea Levy’s bestselling novel, which spawned a two-part TV series more than a decade ago, it was adapted by Helen Edmundson for a 2019 stage production and streamed by the National Theatre the following year. But it would be wholly churlish to sully this big, beautiful show with cynicism, given the wonders it accomplishes. Rufus Norris’s immaculate direction, Jon Driscoll’s astounding screen projections and Katrina Lindsay’s breathtaking set are again central to its success, alongside a superb new cast. Lindsay’s design is glorious in both grand spectacle and delightful detail. Gestural sets descend, ascend or are wheeled on – door frames, a sweet-shop counter, rows of chairs in a classroom. The show opens with a screen that becomes a bigger screen, and this Matryoshka-doll effect pronounces the self-conscious form of storytelling to come: several of the characters narrate the plot as it is being constructed on stage, sometimes with cheek and wit. The construction of the story works so fluidly with the assembly of the set that it is enthralling to behold. There are also vividly flashing interior monologues spoken front of stage, like a shared secret. The story follows a migrating Caribbean couple, Hortense (Leonie Elliott) and Gilbert (Leemore Marrett Jr), who arrive in the “mother country” full of hope, Gilbert having fought in the Royal Air Force, only to be met by hate and hostility. The other leading part is their white British landlady, Queenie (Mirren Mack), while the fourth protagonist of the book is her racist husband, Bernard (Martin Hutson), who is relegated to an ancillary role here. Levy’s novel, written as parallel narratives, places Hortense and Gilbert at its heart. But Edmundson’s adaptation sets Queenie at the centre. Hortense opens the production but her story is placed on pause for too long while Queenie takes centre stage, and when Hortense re-emerges we never feel quite as close to her again. Characters are more comic too, the story fuzzy-edged with sentimentality. But this does not take away from the grim scenes of racism that Gilbert in particular faces in postwar Britain. Edmundson’s truncation of Bernard’s backstory works well in highlighting the clearly displaced fear and illogicality around race hate. Every performance is vigorous, the three central characters wringing our hearts, though Marrett Jr’s Gilbert shines brightest with indefatigable good nature underscored with simmering anger and fierce intelligence. If Small Island appears to have taken a place in the National Theatre’s pantheon already, it is with good reason.

3/5/2022,"Ten days ago Kharkiv was a flourishing metropolis and home to 1.5 million people. It was, as one resident, Galina Padalko, put it, “a beautiful place”. There were parks, a new German architect-designed zoo, thriving cafes and restaurants, and a monumental central square, once adorned with a statue of Lenin. The city had several universities, international students, a ballet theatre and a cathedral that had withstood the last century’s darkest moments. In a few savage days Kharkiv has been transformed into a living hell. Many of the city’s inhabitants are currently sheltering underground in basements, metro stations, and ground-floor corridors. Russian forces have relentlessly bombarded the city this week, pulverising apartment blocks and other civilian targets and threatening to turn Kharkiv into a new Aleppo, which also faced Russian bombing, or Guernica. It has borne the brunt of Vladimir Putin’s rage. “There is bombing the whole day, from morning to evening, ever since the invasion last week,” Padalko, a communications manager, told the Guardian. “Our flat is shaking and vibrating. We have the feeling Putin wants to kill us totally, absolutely completely. It’s awful. He’s really crazy. Nobody can understand why he does this.” She added: “Kharkiv was the best place to live in Ukraine. Now we are terrified to look out of our windows.” At 8am on Tuesday Russia bombed the main administration building in Kharkiv in Freedom Square. Several cars were going past. The building was destroyed. At least 10 people were killed. It has targeted schools, residential neighbourhoods, the zoo with its lions and elephants, government offices, the theatre, and the city’s Assumption Cathedral – part of the Moscow patriarchy – where locals had taken refuge. Dozens have died. The ferocious attack is being carried out with deadly weapons: BM-30 Smerch heavy multiple rocket launchers and, increasingly, bomber planes. On Sunday Russian light armoured vehicles made an unsuccessful attempt to enter and to grab the city. Now Putin appears to have decided to flatten it instead. The message seems demonstrative. It is directed at the defiant government of Ukraine’s pro-western president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy: you and Kyiv are next. It is hard to disagree with Zelenskiy’s grim assessment made in a speech earlier this week that Russia was seeking to “erase” Ukraine and remove it from Europe’s map. “Russia is fighting with a deliberate violation of all conventions, laws and rules of war, trying to cause maximum damage, to civilian and critical infrastructure and to ordinary people,” the presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Moscow’s goal was panic and to cause a refugee crisis, he added. “There are many destroyed houses. We are underground, hiding in our local metro station,” said Maya Mironova from Kharkiv, speaking on her mobile. “There are about a thousand people here. Women, children and also pets, cats and dogs.” Mironova said volunteers had organised food points; some of her friends were in basements elsewhere in her Kharkiv tractor factory district; during breaks in the shelling she was able to dash back to her home. “Putin didn’t realise his ambition to take Kharkiv. It’s the former capital of Soviet Ukraine. It’s symbolic for him. He counted on people’s loyalty to Russia and didn’t get it. And so he’s furious. He wants to bomb us so we surrender,” she said. How long could Kharkiv hold out against unbridled Russian firepower? “We won’t surrender. The Ukrainian army is defending. They are here. But I’m afraid Putin will destroy us,” she said. Across Ukraine similar bleak scenes were being played out. Russian tanks have encircled Mariupol, the once-prosperous port city on the Sea of Azov. Shelling has killed dozens, destroyed the heating and water supply, and left tens of thousands of people shivering in basements, cold and terrified. “They do not plan to occupy the city. They plan to ruin it with grads that do not stop,” a resident, Diana Berg, wrote on her Facebook page. She added: “It’s the third day all city is left with no electricity, heat, water and any type of connection. Even radio is being blocked. Shelling is non-stop. The only news you can get is the direction of the bomb. People go out into their backyards to make a fire in order to get a little warmth. The humanitarian blockade is terrifying. It’s unbearable. We are in the dark with no understanding of what is going on with our relatives.” Berg on Friday said she had managed to leave the city – a “miraculous” journey during which she and her husband, Sasha, drove towards and then past a phalanx of 20 Russian tanks and armoured vehicles. “One turned its canon towards us. But for some fucking reason it didn’t fucking shoot us,” she messaged friends incredulously. She apologised for her bad language, saying: “I’ve been swearing for a week now.” Other urban areas hit by Putin’s missiles resemble a dark phantasmagoria as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. A missile strike on Thursday hit an apartment block in Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, killing 47 people and injuring 18. Video shows bright orange flames, black smoke, broken cars, twisted bodies lying on the street amid rubble, and the piercing, inconsolable scream of a woman. It is a medieval hell, made real by 21st-century Moscow. For now, the capital, Kyiv, is holding firm amid what one former Ukrainian minister described as a “multidirectional raid” by Russia’s army, air force and navy. In the run-up to the invasion little was done to build the city’s defences. Now anti-tank hedgehog traps have been placed along Khreshchatyk, Kyiv’s main boulevard, with its Nike outlets and branch of McDonald’s. The city centre is preternaturally quiet, empty, residents say. There are explosions and birdsong Refugees continue to leave for the west of the country and the relative safety of Lviv, close to the Polish border. Olya Zolotorova, 42, said she had fled her home in the southern city of Mykolaiv, together with her husband and six-year-old son, Leo. Russian troops had blockaded the city but had so far failed to storm it, she said. Its natural geography – Mykolaiv is surrounded by a river on three sides – made it easier to defend from marauding tanks, she said. Zolotorova said she was appalled by the destruction of Kharkiv and other historic cities. “It’s revenge. Putin thought he could capture Ukraine in three days. Now he’s punishing civilians because of his failure.” Nobody could get in or out of Mykolaiv now, she said, adding Russian marines were seeking to storm nearby Odesa, the country’s third-biggest city, and were landing from the Black Sea. “This is one of the most barbaric wars in human history. Just a fucking Mordor,” Illia Ponomarenko, the defence correspondent for the Kyiv Independent, tweeted. Others who escaped Kyiv agreed. “Someone needs to kill Putin. When he is dead this war will stop,” Nikita Perfiliev, a digital marketer, said, sipping a cup of coffee outside a Lviv cafe. A home-drawn poster in its window said: “Fuck off Russian warship” – a message broadcast by Ukrainian sailors and now a meme. “Kharkiv was special. It’s even hard to talk about it,” said Artem Mazhulin, a 31-year-old English teacher. “We had a ferris wheel, a rollercoaster and a cable car in Gorky Park. I went round the new zoo when it opened and saw ostriches and zebras.” Mazhulin said he left Kharkiv on Tuesday, getting on a train packed with students from Nigeria, India and Morocco, with about 100 people in one carriage. The journey to Kyiv was scary, he said, until the train finally crossed to the right bank of the capital and kept going. “We then stopped at towns and villages. People came to the train windows and gave us home-preserved vegetables and water,” he said. What would happen next? Could Ukraine win the war? Would it survive? “We can’t just give up,” he said. “Our spirit is very high.”",News/World news,‘Putin wants to kill us totally’: Ukrainians hold firm under bombardment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/putin-wants-to-kill-us-totally-ukrainians-hold-firm-under-bombardment
3/5/2022,"In New York’s East Village neighborhood, home to a wide array of popular restaurants and bars, is a decades-old staple in the city’s famous food scene. Veselka, located in a smaller pocket of the area once known as “Little Ukraine”, now sits at the corner of food and international politics. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has displaced millions and forced ordinary citizens to take up arms, or flee across borders to safety. Those problems aren’t just affecting the people of Ukraine, but thousands of their loved ones abroad – including some at this beloved New York restaurant. The violence, which began on 24 February, has struck a chord for New Yorkers, Ukrainian or otherwise. Throngs of anti-war protesters waving blue and yellow flags have held demonstrations in Times Square, the West Village and Brooklyn’s Brighton Beach (home to a large Ukrainian-American community), since the violence began. Here at Veselka, those at a loss for how to help, do what they know best: eat. On a Wednesday morning at 10.30am, a line is already forming around the corner. The menu – which boasts pierogies, potato pancakes and borscht – isn’t normally considered brunch food. A homemade “Ukraine belongs to Ukrainians’’ poster greets customers as they walk in. Flyers urging customers to support Ukraine are distributed and taped to the building’s towering windows: “Eat Borscht – Stand with Ukraine” – reads a poster, signaling that 100% of proceeds made from the restaurant’s famous bright-red beet soup are being donated to help Ukraine. A woman visiting from Los Angeles named Havva, waits patiently at the back of the line. “We love Veselka. We’ve been here many times. We just thought we’d come and support the community,” she says. Artie Athas orders borscht to go for his friend, prior to visiting him in the hospital. Athas lives a few blocks away from the restaurant and is a frequent customer, but said recent events have compelled him to visit more. “I was here Saturday afternoon and the line was stretching around the corner. I come regularly but it certainly [has] a different meaning now. It’s so heartbreaking and hard to see,” he says, referring to the war. “But [it’s] wonderful to see the support for this establishment.” Veselka is small by most restaurant standards, but large for New York’s prime East Village neighborhood. Colorful art adorns the pink walls of the bustling establishment. Its tin ceiling is painted a dark-green. The hostess, named Zen, has worked at Veselka for the last five years. She tells a man inquiring about a table that there is “a bit of a wait, but it shouldn’t be more than ten minutes”. “Things pick up around noon,” she explains, although it’s difficult to imagine what it would look like if things were any busier. Veselka’s owner, Jason Birchard, is a third-generation Ukrainian-American. He said the invasion of Ukraine turned him from a longtime optimist into a pessimist. “I just hope peace will prevail. I mean, I don’t want to go on a rant, but the Ukrainian staff really feels abandoned. They feel helpless. Why is Ukraine being sacrificed? Because of the threat of a nuclear bomb?” he asks. Birchand refuses to refer to Vladimir Putin by name when he speaks – instead, he frequently calls him a “mad man”. “He doesn’t deserve the recognition,” explains Birchard, of the decision not to call the Russian President by his name.Veselka, which means “rainbow” in Ukrainian, was started by Birchard’s maternal grandfather, Wlodymyr Darmochwal, who escaped Russian oppression in the late 1940’s. Upon arriving to New York, he opened a small newsstand in 1954 that eventually evolved into Veselka. Today, the restaurant is raved about by celebrities and food critics alike, including the late Anthony Bourdain. Birchard was not originally sold on entering the family business after he graduated from Suny Albany in 1989, but eventually called the decision “a no-brainer”. The last two years have been devastating for the global food service industry because of the Covid-19 pandemic and Veselka was no exception. Birchard painfully recalls completely shutting down for eight weeks in 2020. Today, Birchand feels grateful for the influx of customers showing support, but feels sadness for his staff experiencing emotional distress about their loved ones back home. Birchard’s own aunt lives in a remote village in Ukraine and he is concerned about what life will be like for her under Russian rule. Birchard said it was the staff, almost half of which is Ukrainian, that began efforts to collect donations for the war. The restaurant is collecting items like batteries, socks, underwear, and diapers to ship overseas to Ukraine. Veselka also partnered with the human rights non-profit, Razom. But some staff want to do more for the cause. “Some of the younger Ukrainian males have expressed interest [in going back home to fight.] They’re perplexed about how the next days are playing out,” he says, adding: “I tried to offer them words of support.” He thinks the best way to help is to raise funds and send them abroad, but he adds, : “If they want to go, I’ll support them.” Like clockwork, the line begins to wrap around the corner of the restaurant just as it is approaching noon, exactly as Zen said it would. Birchard begins to get up to get back to a busy day of work. He ends with a melancholic plea for optimism: “I’m hopeful that there’ll be larger protests, not only here but around the world,” he says. Birchand is particularly grateful to those protesting in Russia – applauding the bravery it must take to stand up to Putin at home. But, he adds with caution: “How long will they last? And will they make a difference?”",News/US news,A beloved New York restaurant becomes place of unity for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/veselka-beloved-new-york-restaurant-rallying-spot-ukraine
3/5/2022,"Cutting back on the final drink of the evening could substantially improve brain health, scientists have said. A major study of more than 36,000 adults suggests that the negative effects of alcohol consumption grow stronger with each additional drink. So those who drink several units each day potentially have the most to gain by reducing their drinking. “There is some evidence that the effect of drinking on the brain is exponential,” said Dr Remi Daviet, the study’s first author, who is based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “So, one additional drink in a day could have more of an impact than any of the previous drinks that day. That means that cutting back on that final drink of the night might have a big effect in terms of brain ageing.” The study found that the more a person drinks the smaller their brain and that there was less connectivity in the brain’s white matter. Even modest levels of drinking – a few glasses of wine a week – appeared to carry a risk. And the link between alcohol consumption and reductions in overall brain volume grew stronger the greater the level of alcohol consumption. The study follows previous work showing links between alcohol consumption and brain health. But it was unclear whether moderate levels of drinking had an impact – some had even suggested that light drinking could be beneficial. The NHS recommends not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis, although states that there is no completely safe level of drinking. The latest study used a dataset of MRI scans from more than 36,000 adults in the UK Biobank and the sheer size of this cohort allowed the relationship between drinking and brain health to be examined in much greater detail. The research showed a negative association between even one drink a day and brain volume and the link grew stronger the greater the level of alcohol consumption. In 50-year-olds, increasing average drinking from one alcohol unit (half a pint of beer) a day to two units (a pint of beer or a glass of wine) was associated with changes in the brain equivalent to ageing two years. Going from two to three alcohol units at the same age was like ageing three and a half years. “It’s not linear,” said Daviet. “It gets worse the more you drink.” The study shows an association between drinking and brain volume, rather than proving that this was the underlying cause. “Our study does not randomly assign people to drink, this would not be ethical to do,” said Dr Reagan Wetherill, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and a co-author. However, there are plausible reasons for thinking that alcohol has a negative impact on the brain. Alcohol intoxication activates pro-inflammatory enzymes in the brain, Wetherill said, and this could lead to the loss of grey matter and the structure of white matter connection in the brain being impaired. In future, the authors hope to look in more detail at drinking patterns, including whether drinking one beer a day is better than drinking none during the week and then seven on the weekend. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.",News/Society,Cutting back on final drink of day ‘could improve brain health’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/04/cutting-back-on-final-drink-of-day-could-improve-brain-health
3/5/2022,"Pharmacists have criticised as “short-sighted” the government’s decision to cut the number of people in England who get a free winter flu jab, especially with Covid-19 still circulating. Ministers have decided that people aged 50 to 64 and schoolchildren aged 11-15 will not be eligible to receive the vaccine on the NHS next winter as part of the new “living with Covid” strategy. The change means millions of people will have to pay for the jab privately. The Department of Health and Social Sare (DHSC) is scaling back eligibility, which was widened significantly after the pandemic struck in 2020 to help reduce the death toll from Covid. Evidence showed that people who caught Covid and flu at the same time were twice as likely to die as those who only contracted the virus. “It’s short-sighted to cut back on this sensible public health measure, given that no one can say for certain that we’ll be through the Covid pandemic by next winter”, said Nick Kaye, the vice-chair of the National Pharmacy Association. Already over-stretched A&E units will come under even more strain if people get flu and need medical attention, he said. “In any event, the NHS will be under huge demand pressure for several years to come, and wide access to the flu vaccine helps keep people away from the hospital front door.” The DHSC defended its reversion to offering a free jab only to the groups who were eligible pre-pandemic. These include everyone over 65, adults whose underlying illness means they are deemed at risk, pregnant women and children aged between two and 10 on 31 August. “Thanks to the success of the Covid vaccination programme and treatments available to individuals most at risk, we are now able to live with Covid and it is right that we return our other vaccination programmes such as flu back to pre-pandemic levels”, a spokesperson said. In a letter sent by the NHS to clinicians this week, NHS England makes clear that the groups eligible for free flu jabs next winter had been decided by the DHSC and Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the government. It stresses that “seasonal flu vaccination remains an important public health intervention and a key priority for 2022/23 to reduce morbidity, mortality and hospitalisations associated with flu at a time when the NHS and social care will be managing winter pressures, potentially including further outbreaks of Covid-19.” Dr Layla Hannbeck, the chief executive of the Association of Multiple Pharmacies, told the Telegraph: “No one has communicated to the public that the offer of flu jabs this year is going to be any different to last year. “Last year, over-50s were being told they should get their jab, now the advice has changed, but no one is explaining why. It’s going to cause so much confusion.” Giulia Guerrini , the lead pharmacist at online pharmacy Medino, called the decision “quite worrying”. She stressed that vaccination was important because “immune systems are lower than ever due to our bodies having had a lower amount of exposure to viruses than normal over the last two years”. The decision will save money for the DHSC as GPs and pharmacists will be paid for delivering millions fewer jabs. The DHSC’s budget is under pressure because it is unclear who will pay for health and social care workers to be tested for Covid, which will continue despite the government’s “living with Covid” approach, which includes axing free lateral flow tests from 1 April.",News/Society,Pharmacists hit out at plan to scale back free flu jabs in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/04/pharmacists-hit-out-at-plan-to-scale-back-free-flu-jabs-in-england
3/5/2022,"The suffering of the Ukrainian people at the hands of Russian forces is set to worsen in the coming days and the war is at risk of spreading elsewhere in Europe, Nato’s secretary general has said. Following a meeting of the alliance’s foreign ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said the civilian death toll was mounting, with cities under siege and schools and homes being destroyed. In the latest sobering assessment of the military situation, he told reporters that there was evidence of the use of cluster bombs and “other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law”. Stoltenberg further warned that the risk of Russian military attacks or “subversion” was rising in Georgia, on whose territory Vladimir Putin’s troops are already present, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have been threatening to break up the state with the Kremlin’s support. “The days to come, are likely to be worse,” Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels. “With more death, more suffering, and more destruction as the Russian armed forces bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country.” He added: “The Kremlin’s ambition is to recreate a sphere of influence and deny other countries the right to choose their own path. So ministers discussed the need to support partners who may be at risk, including Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. “Russia’s aggression has created a new normal for our security, where fundamental principles are contested through the use of force and we face the threat of conflict for years to come.” He said Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina may be at risk of “even more intervention, subversion and potentially even attacks by the Russian armed forces”. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba addressed the Nato foreign ministers, including the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. The calls from Ukraine for Nato to police a “no-fly zone” over the country had been raised during the meeting in Brussels but Stoltenberg said the alliance could not directly engage with Russian forces. He said: “We have a responsibility as Nato allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine, because that will be even more dangerous, more devastating, and will cause even more human suffering. So we have made it clear we are not going to move into Ukraine neither on the ground or in the Ukrainian airspace. “Of course, the only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato planes, fighter planes into Ukraine airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes. “Our assessment is that we understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a fully fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.” Meanwhile Vladimir Putin warned Russia’s neighbours “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country during the latest broadcast of a government meeting in Moscow. “There are no bad intentions towards our neighbours,” Putin said. “I would also advise them not to escalate the situation, not to introduce any restrictions. We fulfil all our obligations and will continue to fulfil them.” Stoltenberg, Blinken and Truss will join EU foreign ministers at an extraordinary meeting later on Friday to discuss the impact of the west’s imposition of far-reaching sanctions on Russia and the next steps. The issue of creating humanitarian corridors, agreed during Thursday’s meeting between Ukrainian and Russian officials, will also be on the agenda. More than 1.2 million people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, according to the latest UN figures. The United Nations security council will hold an emergency meeting in New York in response to the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by Russian troops, who have now seized the area. The session was requested by the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, with the support of the US, France, Norway, Ireland and Albania.",News/World news,Nato chief warns of worse suffering in Ukraine and Russian attacks elsewhere,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/nato-chief-warns-of-worse-suffering-in-ukraine-and-russian-attacks-elsewhere
3/5/2022,"Ralf Rangnick believes Manchester United have to become more like Manchester City and Liverpool by appointing a manager who has a clear way of playing and can implement this over the long term. United travel to City for Sunday’s 187th derby trailing the champions by 19 points with 11 matches left. In the past decade City have secured the title five times, with Pep Guardiola guiding them to three of these, and Liverpool have done so once, under Jürgen Klopp, who has also won the Champions League. Rangnick was asked whether United were in the position to have a similar successful structure to City’s. “I have not thought about that,” the interim manager said. “I don’t even know the structure or setup at City. My focus was, and still is, on developing the current team and getting best out of this season. City and Liverpool have continuity and consistency in their head coach, for past five or six years. “They have very clear identity, how they want to play. I know Jürgen in person and I know Pep from his time in Germany managing Bayern Munich; he also has a clear idea how he wants to play. This is the secret behind their success: they know exactly how they want to play, a corporate identity. Not just for new players but for staff members too. This is what all the top clubs have in common. This is something that needs to be developed at Manchester United.” Rangnick adheres to a fast-pressing style and was asked whether his replacement in the summer would retain this. “That would depend on the decision regarding the head coach next season,” he said. “Every coach has their own idea of football. For me it’s about consistency on the highest possible level and also quality of players. “We all agree with Jürgen and Pep [being] in the top five [in the world] – certainly they’re the best two coaches in Europe. It’s pretty easy in football: you need to have the best possible people, a clear idea of football and stick to that idea and make decisions with that in mind.” Rangnick expects Edinson Cavani to be in the squad after injury. Guardiola will be without Rúben Dias for up to six weeks because of a hamstring problem and Nathan Aké, another defender, is also injured. Guardiola stated he did not see the 19-point gap. “I see the weakness points they have and I see the strengths points they have, but if I see this as an easy game I’m not going to sleep well,” he said. “To sleep well I have to see the best of them but when they don’t have the ball I try to find the weaknesses that they have. But of course always I think the best version of all of them. Otherwise I would make a mistake.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick urges Manchester United to adopt rivals’ continuity,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/ralf-rangnick-manchester-united-needs-to-be-like-manchester-city-and-liverpool
