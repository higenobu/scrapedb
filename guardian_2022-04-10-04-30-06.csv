4/10/2022,"No manager has beaten Pep Guardiola as often as Jürgen Klopp, although the balance is swinging the Manchester City manager’s way, with one defeat in nine meetings since the Champions League quarter-finals of April 2018. Theirs is one of the great rivalries, a meeting of two coaches who have done more than anybody else to shape the tactical landscape of modern football. But how might they set up on Sunday and where is the game between Liverpool and their Premier League title rivals likely to be won and lost? Phil Foden was Manchester City’s key attacking presence in the 2-2 draw at Anfield as he found space on the City left again and again. He scored the first and it was his run and half-cleared cross that led to Kevin De Bruyne’s late equaliser. That, though, was against James Milner, who struggled to such an extent that he probably should have been sent off. At the Etihad it could be different. For one thing, there is no guarantee Foden will play on the left. That he was on the bench against Atlético Madrid suggested one or both of two things. First, that Guardiola envisaged the game playing out pretty much as it did, with Atlético sitting deep and frustrating City: what a strength to have, then, to be able to weary them, dragging them this way and that, before deploying your most creative asset against tired legs with 20 minutes remaining. Sure enough, within 90 seconds Foden had identified and exploited a space to set up De Bruyne for the winner. And second that he was being kept fresh for Liverpool; they are a better team than Atlético and there is a good argument that Sunday’s game will have a greater bearing on the destination of a trophy than Tuesday’s first leg of a Champions League quarter-final. Foden surely will play against Liverpool – but it may be that he is used as the false 9, the position occupied by Jack Grealish at Anfield. Trent Alexander-Arnold missed the game against City at Anfield with a calf injury, but he is available on Sunday. Nobody in the Premier League has registered more assists this season than Alexander-Arnold and his remarkable crossing ability was seen again against Benfica on Tuesday as his ball to Luis Díaz laid on the second for Sadio Mané. What was striking was not just the pace and accuracy of the delivery, but that it came from a deep position, several yards in from the flank; there was almost no margin for error. Almost no matter where he is on the field, Alexander-Arnold simply cannot be given time to cross. How can City stop him? If they can press effectively and dominate possession, that may be enough to restrict Alexander-Arnold’s influence. But at Anfield they had 52% of the ball and while it’s possible, perhaps even likely, that figure will be higher at home, it is hard to see City’s control of the ball being anything like enough that Alexander-Arnold is not a threat. In both games last season – a 1-1 draw at the Etihad when Liverpool played a surprising 4-4-2 shape with Mané and Diogo Jota as the wide-midfielders-cum-wingers, and a 4-1 win for City at Anfield – Raheem Sterling was used on the City left, less for his diligence than that he could accelerate into any space Alexander-Arnold left behind on his forward sallies. That space is an inevitable fact of the way Alexander-Arnold plays but can be mitigated by Liverpool’s press that, when working to its maximum, should deny opponents time to measure balls in behind the full-back. When it goes wrong, as away to Real Madrid last season, Alexander-Arnold can look as though he is hopelessly out of position. But the issue is rather that his way of playing, which gives Liverpool such potency, is predicated on a functioning and aggressive press – which is probably the main reason that Alexander-Arnold, for all his ability on the ball, is not Gareth Southgate’s preferred choice for England. If Guardiola chooses again to engage in what is in effect a game of chicken, Sterling looks the more likely option given he remains probably more defensively reliable than Grealish. If he prefers the more conservative option, Gabriel Jesus could be used effectively to harry Alexander-Arnold while still offering some creative threat. A decade ago, Guardiola had revolutionised football with his possession-heavy football, and Klopp had just begun the fightback by devising a press that won the ball back faster and more aggressively than had been seen before. Both have subsequently modified their approach so Thiago Alcântara, a longtime Guardiola favourite, will probably be in the Liverpool midfield, while City are more direct in transition than Guardiola’s Barcelona. But this remains a battle between the two major schools of modern football: those that prioritise retaining possession and those that prioritise regaining it. One of the consequences of that process is it increasingly feels as though the key battles are those between wide forwards and full-backs. In a competitive field, Mo Salah’s performance against City at Anfield this season was probably his greatest in a Liverpool shirt, featuring an extraordinary assist and a brilliant goal. He has perhaps not been entirely at his best recently, with no goals from open play in his past eight games for Liverpool, but there is no doubt he will start on the right and Klopp had the benefit of being able to take him off after an hour of Tuesday’s win at Benfica. With Kyle Walker suspended, João Cancelo switched to the right in Lisbon, with Nathan Aké in at left-back, but the Portugal international will surely return to left-back. His two-footedness means he should be less susceptible to Salah cutting infield than many defenders, but that did not particularly help at Anfield. The extent to which Cancelo can get forward to operate as an auxiliary midfielder, which is one of the ways City tend to dominate possession, is likely to be key. It is a similar story in the other full-back v wide forward battles. Andy Robertson has one assist fewer than Salah this season, while Riyad Mahrez is City’s joint top-scorer in the league. While Walker will not be troubled for pace by either Mané or Díaz, with Rúben Dias out, City could be vulnerable to a rapid forward on the diagonal trying to get John Stones on the turn. The centre is about achieving control, but this is a game when the decisive moments will probably come from the flanks.",Sport/Football,A clash of great rivals: the key battles that will decide Manchester City v Liverpool | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/09/a-clash-of-great-rivals-the-key-battles-that-will-decide-manchester-city-v-liverpool
4/10/2022,"Pakistan was in constitutional crisis as fears of martial law swirled after the prime minister, Imran Khan, blocked a vote of no-confidence on his rule – despite a legally binding ruling by the supreme court that the vote must go ahead. Khan, the former international cricketer turned pious Islamist politician, is clinging to his political career for dear life after he and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party used various means – including filibustering and legal petitions – to prevent the no-confidence vote, which he was expected to lose, from going ahead. Khan had tried to halt the vote a week ago by dissolving parliament before it could go ahead. But a damning verdict by Pakistan’s supreme court on Thursday found that the prime minister had broken the law and they called for a vote.. But over the course of 13 tumultuous hours until late into the night, members of Khan’s party prevented the vote going ahead. The opposition accused Khan of trying to hold the constitution and government “hostage” and commit treason. At one stage, the speaker, an ally of Khan, declared he would refuse to put the vote to parliament, despite this being in contempt of court. The opposition claimed that Khan was refusing to let the vote go ahead unless he could get a guarantee that neither he nor his cabinet ministers would face criminal cases once they stepped down. Marriyam Aurangzeb, an opposition spokesperson, told the Observer it was “a violation of the constitution and the supreme court’s order, and they should be ready for the consequences. It’s contempt of the court by Imran Khan and speaker and everyone involved.” As Khan held meetings with ministers and senior military figures yesterday, many feared that he would try to get Pakistan’s powerful army to step in and declare martial law rather than hand over power to the opposition. As fear of unrest grew, security was beefed up around the prime minister’s residence. In response, Pakistan’s chief justice took the unprecedented step of asking the supreme court to be ready to open its doors at midnight, should the vote not happen. The Islamabad high court also prepared to hear a late-night contempt of court case. As the midnight deadline for the vote approached, Khwaja Asif, a leader from the opposition alliance, accused Khan’s government of trying to usurp democracy and “create an environment for martial law. They want the parliament dissolved”. Last week’s no-confidence vote was tabled by the opposition in the midst of an economic crisis that has pummelled Khan’s popularity. Khan shocked the opposition by instructing the deputy speaker of the house, a close ally, to throw out the vote on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations that it was the result of a “foreign conspiracy” to unseat him. Khan then instructed the president, another ally, to dissolve parliament and announced fresh elections would happen within three months. He defended the move as an attempt to protect Pakistan from a western- and specifically US-led conspiracy to interfere in its affairs. The opposition described it as a “civilian coup” and a treasonous attempt by Khan to cling to power despite losing his majority. They appealed to the supreme court, which ultimately overturned Khan’s move. The no-confidence vote was expected to lead the way for a new opposition coalition government, with the leader of the opposition, Shahbaz Sharif, the brother of the jailed former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, as interim prime minister. The opposition has stated its intention to hold elections, likely to be October at the earliest. Despite many suggesting he might resign rather than face the humiliation of a defeat in parliament, in a late night address to the nation, Khan made it clear he had no intention of stepping aside voluntarily. He called for his supporters to take to the streets in mass protest and said he would not accept any “imported” government, a veiled reference to his previous allegations that the political opposition had conspired with western powers to topple him, a charge they deny. “What is happening with our democracy is catastrophic,” Khan said in his speech. Khan, once a national cricketing hero and international playboy, was elected in 2018 as the “modern” face of Pakistan, who had the backing of the military and promised economic prosperity and an end to corruption. But his time in office has been blighted by economic crisis, including record inflation . He had also been seen to pander to militant Islamic groups, and during his time in office religious violence and public lynchings of those accused of blasphemy were on the rise. Nonetheless Khan still commands fierce among his many supporters and is expected to contest the next elections. In a Twitter post following the supreme court ruling, Khan wrote: “My message to our nation is I have always and will continue to fight for Pak till the last ball.”",News/World news,Pakistan on brink of crisis as Imran Khan blocks no-confidence vote,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/pakistan-on-brink-of-crisis-as-imran-khan-blocks-no-confidence-vote
4/10/2022,"Boris Johnson made a surprise trip to Kyiv yesterday to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pledging a major new infusion of British arms and financial aid to help counter the expected deadly new phase in Russia’s military offensive. After the meeting, the prime minister said: “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century. “It is because of President Zelenskiy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted. I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run. “We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.” Last night No 10 said Britain would send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine. The UK pledged £100m in military assistance last week, including another 800 anti-tank missiles, more Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons, “suicide drones”, which hover over the battlefield before attacking a target, and helmets, body armour and night vision goggles. Johnson has been praised by Zelenskiy, who contrasts his strong rhetoric against Russian aggression and the fulfilment of a promise to deliver vital anti-tank weapons to its army with the more timid responses from other Nato-member countries such as Germany. The security situation in Ukraine’s capital has stabilised since Russia withdrew from its positions around the city on 29 March to regroup its forces and consolidate territorial gains in Ukraine’s south and east. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen also visited Ukraine’s capital on Friday, as well as the nearby town of Bucha, where overwhelming evidence suggests that civilians were raped and murdered by Russian troops. Johnson’s visit comes a day after Zelenskiy called on western allies to provide more military aid and step up sanctions on Russia in the wake of a missile attack on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk that killed 52 people, including five children. Russia’s defence ministry has denied responsibility for the strike, but western intelligence officials believe a Russian short range ballistic missile was fired indiscriminately towards the town centre. At the time of the attack the station was packed with civilians who had been ordered by the Ukrainian government to evacuate the town in the face of the Russian advance from the south-east. “I have already left Kramatorsk, because when a missile hit a school very close to my house, we were very scared,” said Sofiya Ruban, 17, who fled to the Kyiv area with her family. “When we heard about yesterday’s airstrikes at the railway station we were shocked and very saddened.” Russian shelling and missile attacks have intensified in several areas across eastern Ukraine as Moscow moves its “special military operation” away from toppling the government to focus on building a corridor connecting the Russian-occupied region of Crimea with Luhansk and Donetsk – also de-facto controlled by Moscow – with the Russian mainland. The besieged city of Mariupol, together with the southern city of Mykolaiv, which has faced major shelling, are major Kremlin targets, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. With trains not running out of Kramatorsk on Saturday, panicked residents boarded buses or looked for other ways to get out, fearing the kind of unrelenting assaults and occupations by Russian invaders that delivered food shortages, demolished buildings and death to other cities elsewhere in Ukraine. Zelenskiy called the station attack the latest example of war crimes by Russian forces and said it should motivate the west to do more to help his country defend itself.“All world efforts will be directed to establish every minute of who did what, who gave what orders, where the missile came from, who transported it, who gave the command and how this strike was agreed,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. In response to the shelling of Kramatorsk, a curfew in the southern port city of Odesa went into effect on Saturday evening until Monday evening. Ten humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from embattled areas across the country had been agreed on Saturday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, but by nightfall it was unclear whether civilians had been able to make it to Ukrainian-controlled territory. Several attempts to evacuate 150,000 people still in Mariupol, which has been under constant fire since 24 February, and bring in vital provisions such as food and medicine, have ended in failure after alleged Russian shelling of safe routes. Two UN agencies also called for urgent action to help an estimated 1,000 seafarers stranded in Ukrainian ports and waters with dwindling supplies. The US-based Institute for the Study of War said that Ukrainian forces retain control of defensive positions in eastern and south-western Mariupol, and Russian forces are continuing to attempt to redeploy units in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces are “unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale”, ISW said Last week, Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, said the country had “significant losses of troops and it’s a huge tragedy for us” during an interview on Sky News. The conflict may be in danger of becoming a gruelling war of attrition. The Pentagon estimates that Russia’s combat power is between 80% and 85% of pre-invasion levels.",News/World news,Boris Johnson pledges to send more arms during surprise visit to Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/boris-johnson-pledges-to-send-more-arms-during-surprise-visit-to-kyiv
4/10/2022,"There have been some see-sawing contests in Europe over the years but few that have lurched so markedly from one extreme to the other. Munster looked dead and buried for long periods of this eventful tie but by the end it was Exeter, reduced to 13 men for a chunk of the final quarter, who were relieved to hear the final whistle. In the final analysis Exeter were indebted to a remarkable 45-metre drop goal from Stuart Hogg which may yet offer some kind of lifeline in Limerick on Easter Saturday. Munster, though, will be massively buoyed by the spirit they showed in adversity, a 66th minute try by winger Shane Daly having left this two-leg encounter beautifully poised at the halfway stage. Even in the good old days Munster have rarely had to overcome such a lengthy injury list or more off-field discontent but some things never change. The visitors were nothing if not cussed and might even have won had Exeter, with Olly Woodburn and Patrick Schickerling in the sin-bin, not kept their line intact throughout a 13-phase Munster assault. Fair play to Munster’s Keith Earls, too, whose tackle on Woodburn prevented an almost certain late score that may yet prove significant. Munster will regard this as a moral victory in some respects, given their long list of absentees. With Peter O’Mahony, Andrew Conway, Joey Carbery, Tadhg Beirne, Dave Kilcoyne and Gavin Coombes already missing, it was almost cruel when a stomach bug ruled out Simon Zebo and reserve hooker Diarmuid Barron on the eve of the game. It was not surprise, then, that Munster were soon right up against it physically, with Exeter putting a sparkling try on the board inside six minutes. A quick tap penalty was whisked right to Tom O’Flaherty who made a typically sharp break and a flying Hogg duly finished off an impressively slick attack. Aside from the breakdown where John Hodnett enjoyed some success the Exeter pack had an edge at the scrums and the home side duly dominated possession and territory. They came close to a couple more tries when first Jack Yeandle and then Dave Ewers were denied when a rumbling score looked highly likely. Could Munster somehow fashion something improbable? Grit automatically comes with the jersey but, for long periods, there was no escaping the inexorable pressure. By the time Jacques Vermeulen finally drove over for Exeter’s long overdue second try two minutes before half-time the visitors had also lost replacement Jack O’Sullivan to the sin-bin after the promising young No 8 Alex Kendellen had failed a head injury assessment. Both conversions floated wide on the breeze, though, which meant Exeter led by only 10-0 at the interval. The home and away format suited them perfectly back in 2010 when they were seeking to clinch promotion at Bristol’s expense from the Championship but Thomond Park is rarely the best place to go for a stress-free second leg. Hence the renewed sense of Exeter purpose in the third quarter when, initially, they again did pretty much everything except score. It has been a recurring theme this season and as the stolen lineouts, penalties and turnovers began to mount up, so did Munster’s morale. A simple penalty from stand-off Ben Healy narrowed the deficit to seven points and, for the first time, the Fields of Athenry could be heard in Devon. Worse was to follow for Exeter when first Woodburn and then Schickerling were sent to the bin inside three minutes for a rogue forearm and playing the ball on the ground respectively. Could the 13 men hold on? With the help of Hogg’s majestic hoof, the answer was yes. Just.",Sport/Sport,Stuart Hogg’s 45-metre drop goal helps Exeter take early edge over Munster,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/exeter-munster-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
4/10/2022,"It was difficult to distinguish between what made Tottenham Hotspur fans the happiest on the evening Son Heung-Min’s hat-trick enabled Antonio Conte’s side to capitalise on Arsenal’s second defeat in a week to move three points clear of their North London rivals in the contest for fourth place in the Premier League. Manchester City and Liverpool may have other matters on their minds right now but they are the only teams to have accumulated more top-flight points than Spurs since Conte was appointed five months ago. “Are you watching Arsenal?” inquired the travelling fans who can look ahead to their biggest derby on May 12 with increasing confidence after this sixth win in seven games, which followed their rivals’ home defeat by Brighton. Remarkably Villa were the stronger side, after Son’s third-minute opener, before Dejan Kulusevski made it 2-0 in the sixth minute of the second half.. Steven Gerrard’s pre-match message that he would be re-evaluating the captaincy in the summer obviously did nothing to inspire Tyrone Mings and company who fell to a fourth successive defeat. The ink was barely dry on Gerrard’s programme notes exhorting his side to “start turning 45-minute performances into 90-minute performances” when Villa went behind in the third minute. This had nothing to do with Spurs’ exemplary record at Villa Park — they had won their previous six league visits here — and more to do with a simple long ball with which the home team failed to deal. Eric Dier did not even put much angle on his lofted pass to the edge of the Villa penalty area but Ezri Konsa mistimed his jump so his header only fell to Harry Kane. The England captain’s misdirected shot hit rebounded off Matty Cash straight to Son who sweetly half-volleyed home his 16th goal of the season, with his left foot, low into the corner. If Spurs thought were Villa were about to roll over, however, in the wake of three consecutive defeats, a ferocious response soon refocused their minds. Spurs found Villa came out fighting like their livelihoods depended on salvaging a positive result. Matt Doherty, who soon had to be substituted with a knee injury following Cash’s thunderous tackle, Sergio Reguilón, after the replacement’s first touch, and Kulusevski all required treatment as Villa flew into the kind of on-the-edge tackles that made their manager such a fearsome competitor back in his early playing days. Only one of these three was a foul — the recalled Danny Ings was cautioned for going in late on Reguilón — but the sheer intensity of Villa’s play earned them a foothold in the game. Hugo Lloris may be a good judge, when he looks back on this game, of which of their 15 goal attempts in the remainder of the half came closest to an equaliser. Jacob Ramsey went on a brilliant run between two defenders before his fulminating left-footed shot required an instinctive one-handed save from the Spurs captain to palm the ball up and over the bar. Then Lloris parried John McGinn’s left-footer as Villa turned up the heat although Ings should have done better with his volley as he spun on to an early free-kick from Philippe Coutinho that caught Spurs napping. Ollie Watkins climbed free but headed over from Coutinho’s left-wing cross, and the England striker was sent in by Ings to force a partial save before Dier hacked clear. Then Ings slid his shot wide when Watkins nodded on Ramsey’s cross, Cash had a volley saved then, in the final moments of a first half that vibrated with Villa’s intent, Coutinho’s cunning free-kick was fisted unconvincingly out by Lloris as Spurs, somehow, held on. It was not that Spurs were playing badly; it was just that Villa were attacking so passionately there was no let-up. The half-time break favoured Spurs who, having regrouped, came out and again scored early. However good Villa were in their first-half build-up play, they were again unconvincing in the manner in which they defended the straightforward high ball. For the second goal, Kane had time to glance across before he beat Konsa in the air to nod the ball down for Kulusevski, who was allowed time to take a couple of touches and compose himself before drilling in his third goal since joining from Juventus in January through Mings’ legs. Then midway through the second half, the result was boxed off. Cristian Romero clipped his lofted pass to Kane who flicked on a header for Son to race through the middle, get ahead of Cash, and strike with his left foot from the edge of the area. The South Korean completed his hat-trick five minutes later when he ran onto Kane’s pass, slipped the ball off for Kulusevski – who sent Mings to his knees with a good touch – and dropped off to sidefoot home with ease from 12 yards out.",Sport/Football,Son hat-trick sinks Aston Villa as Tottenham tighten grip on fourth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/son-hat-trick-sinks-aston-villa-as-tottenham-tighten-grip-on-fourth
4/10/2022,"If further evidence were needed of the benefits of scheduling the Women’s Six Nations to stand alone, England’s third consecutive bonus-point win in front of 14,689 fans surely provided it. Two each for Jess Breach and Lark Davies among England’s 10 tries helped to overpower Wales, who defended with spirit before the workload simply became too much. As they build towards this year’s World Cup, Simon Middleton and his squad will have areas they want to improve: the lineout misfired occasionally and Wales inflicted pain at scrum time, particularly before the break. A serious injury to Abby Dow was also a significant downside, but this was ultimately a crushing success which showcased England’s balanced all-round game. Wales, for the first time, have 12 players on full-time contracts this season and will continue to improve. But the gulf in class became increasingly apparent as the evening wore on. Abbie Ward’s damaging, tackle-breaking early run suggested it was going to be a long afternoon for the Welsh defenders and the Red Roses showed their collective strength on their first visit to Wales’s 22, shoving a maul 10 metres. Wales’s early defending was up to standard, however, and they soon demonstrated their own power at a couple of scrums and with a well-drilled driving maul. It took an excellent tackle by the England fly-half Zoe Harrison to bring down Kayleigh Powell, the Wales full-back, who chucked a lovely dummy before stealing through the hosts’ line. A mammoth hit by the England prop Sarah Bern also sent the Wales openside flanker, Alisha Butchers, into reverse. Dow, playing at full-back, went down injured on 13 minutes as the hosts neared the try-line and a lengthy stoppage was the result. As soon as she had been carried off on a stretcher to a warm ovation, England were over on the right wing with Davies opening the scoring. Donna Rose, the Wales prop, had collapsed to the turf underneath the England drive but, remarkably, it made little difference. Alex Matthews soon wasted an overlap with a poor pass on to Sarah McKenna’s toes, but after the referee, Julianne Zussman, played a long advantage, an excellent touch-finding kick by Harrison set up the position for Ward to crash over for England’s second try. Harrison cracked the conversion confidently through the sticks. More disciplined defending kept England out until the final five minutes of the first half when Breach, making her first England start for nearly a year, displayed her familiar killer instinct to skip over for the third try. Wales had managed two comeback victories in the Six Nations before this but at 19-0 down and with Middleton’s team threatening to move through the gears, another come-from-behind win looked a distant prospect. Even more so four minutes after half-time when Davies again flopped over for the bonus-point score, England’s short-range power overwhelming the Welsh defenders who had got through a mountain of work in the first half. After Breach scored her second try, the Red Roses’ front row continued to bloom when Bern touched down England’s sixth to make it 36-0 after a smart move down the blindside. After Wales’s Natalia John was sent to the sin bin for infringing at a maul, a brilliant offload inside by Abbie Ward, galloping down the right, handed Matthews, the back-rower, a sight of the try-line and she finished with absolute authority while batting off any would-be Welsh tacklers. Wales were not done, however, and Kelsey Jones crashed over for a try after an impressive drive. Shaunagh Brown of Harlequins romped over for England at the other end and Emily Scarratt and Sarah Hunter, the captain, added the ninth and 10th tries respectively to round off a comprehensive victory. England power on, three bonus points from three, with the final-round trip to France promising to be decisive.",Sport/Sport,England and Jess Breach power past Wales to set up Six Nations finale,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/england-and-jess-breach-power-past-wales-to-set-up-six-nations-finale
4/10/2022,"The sun was shining in Zaporizhzhia on Saturday and teams of city workers were out planting flowers on roadside borders. Market stalls were doing a healthy trade in everything from food and drink to electronics, and there were even a few cafes and bars open. But the frontlines are barely a half-hour drive from this industrial city, and much of the region of which it is the capital is under Russian occupation. Underneath the calm exterior, most people here – and across the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine – are anxious about what lies in wait in the coming days and weeks. Having failed miserably in his attempts to march speedily on the Ukrainian capital, Russian president Vladimir Putin withdrew troops from around Kyiv a week ago, leaving ruin, grief and fury in their wake. The expectation now is that he will order a massive assault in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine to capture more ground for Russia and make territorial gains he can present as a victory. The Ukrainian government has suggested residents of the nearby Donbas region should evacuate immediately, while the mayor of neighbouring Dnipro also told women, children and the elderly to leave last week. But as the horrific missile attack on a crowd of civilians in Kramatorsk on Friday showed, Russia has no qualms about fighting beyond the battlefield, and people can face slaughter as they try to escape. “The battle for Donbas will not just be a battle for that territory, it will be a battle for global security,” said Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, a city south of Zaporizhzhia that came under occupation in the first days of the war. Fedorov, who was kidnapped by Russian soldiers and eventually swapped in a prisoner exchange, now works from an office in Zaporizhzhia. After a week in which news of horrific war crimes in Bucha and other small towns near Kyiv has shocked the world, Fedorov’s demeanour in an interview with the Observer was characteristic of a new Ukrainian resolve to continue fighting the Russian assault. “We should not talk about half measures. Today, all the red lines are crossed. Thousands of peaceful citizens have been killed,” said Fedorov, frequently breaking off to field calls on two different phones about continued evacuations from occupied Melitopol. He reacted angrily to a question about whether Ukraine should still attempt to negotiate a peace settlement: “Bucha has been obliterated, fucking obliterated. And you think we’re going to agree to half measures?” This sentiment is widely shared and suggests the battle for Donbas could be long and bloody, involving a more focused and determined Russian attack force, as well as a rejuvenated and vengeful Ukrainian army, fighting on terrain where the war has been continuing for the past eight years. In Zaporizhzhia, government buildings are protected with sandbags while police and sniffer dogs check arriving passengers at the railway station, and air raid sirens sound a few times each day. At the train station, evacuees from Mariupol and other towns occupied by Russia wait for onward travel to western Ukraine and safety. A large billboard on the main street addresses hypothetical Russian occupiers: “Russian soldier! Ukrainians are defending their families! And what will you die for? Put your weapons down. Stay alive.” For now, Russia probably does not have the resources to launch full-scale attacks against cities such as Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro, but it is likely that Putin has not given up on trying to bring at least the eastern half of Ukraine under Moscow’s control. “They will concentrate on Donetsk and Luhansk regions – that is where we will see the most serious battles for now,” deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told the Observer. “Beyond that, it will depend on how things go on the battlefield.” Fedorov said cities such as Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro had the advantage of having time to prepare for a spirited defence. “Melitopol wasn’t ready,” he said. The Russian army took control of Melitopol and a number of other cities in the south of Ukraine in the first days of the war without much of a fight. A few days after the Russians took over Melitopol, a group of armed men Fedorov assumed were from Russia’s security services arrived at his office and said he could keep working as long as he accepted Russian control over the city. “They said Melitopol is Russia, and that we could keep doing what we were doing, but we should recognise that they are now in charge of the security of the city,” he recalled. Melitopol is a largely Russian-speaking city and many people there, including Fedorov, have relatives in Russia. But he said the vast majority of the city is now solidly pro-Ukrainian, and this has only intensified since the Russian invasion. Fedorov, and almost everyone in his team, refused to cooperate with the Russians, he said, leading them to become ever more irate, especially when demonstrators with Ukrainian flags began taking to the streets. “These rallies were the final straw for the Russians and they decided to take me prisoner. In broad daylight, they came to the social assistance centre we’d set up on the first day, where we gave out food and clothes, tied my hands together and put a bag over my head, and marched me out,” he recalled. The Russians appointed Halyna Danylchenko as the new mayor of the city, and she released a video appeal calling on people to welcome Russian rule. “Our main task right now is to adapt to the new reality, so that we can begin to live in a new way,” she said. At the same time, soldiers took Fedorov to one of Melitopol’s pre-trial detention centres, now run by the Russians, and gave him four sheets of paper to sign, offering the resignation of his team and agreeing to hand over power. He said he signed them, as he realised they had no legal power and he was assured he would be able to leave if he did so. After he signed, he was left on his own for a day and a half, then late in the evening of 7 March a new interrogator arrived, and an overnight interrogation began, with a group of armed men standing over him, Fedorov recalled. Fedorov himself was not subjected to physical abuse, but he said it was clear that others in the police station were. “They were playing psychological games. He was being more or less polite, but in the neighbouring cell I could hear screams – it was very audible that they were breaking someone’s fingers,” he said. Fedorov said his conversations with his jailers were surreal. “I asked them to explain what they were doing in my city, in my country. They said: ‘We’re coming to emancipate the Russian language.’ I said: ‘In Melitopol, 95% of people speak Russian – there is not such a problem.’” The guards also said they had come to free Ukraine from Nazis, and to stop second world war veterans being beaten up, Fedorov claimed. “There are 34 living veterans in Melitopol; I know them all, we have good relations, we congratulate each other on 9 May, we meet on 23 October on the day of liberation of Melitopol – this is our history. Not only do we not beat them up, we are very thankful to them that we live under a peaceful sky, there is no question about that,” said Fedorov. After six days in captivity, Fedorov was swapped in a prisoner exchange, and since then has been based in Zaporizhzhia. After meeting president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he then went on a tour of western Europe, bringing a message that the west should do more to support Ukraine. “If there won’t be peace in Ukraine, there will be war in Europe,” is what Fedorov said he told French president Emmanuel Macron when they met in Paris. In the week since Fedorov went to Paris, news of war crimes in Bucha and elsewhere has made it much harder to see any negotiated end to the conflict, at least for the foreseeable future. A week ago, delegations from Russia and Ukraine met in Istanbul, and although there was scepticism about whether either side was ready for a deal on anything even close to terms acceptable to the other side, sources close to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had briefed media outlets that, during the last round of negotiations, the sides were close to a deal. As more and more stories of killings, rapes and other war crimes come to light, however, the optimism looks even more misplaced.“We should approach this professionally, without emotion, and productively,” said Rustem Umerov, a Ukrainian MP who is part of Kyiv’s delegation to the negotiations. But he also made it clear that Ukraine needed to continue inflicting losses on the battlefield in order to win ground in negotiations. “We understand that political power flows from the military situation,” he said. Fedorov said Ukraine would be foolish to stop until it had completely defeated Russia on the battlefield, otherwise it would only be buying time for a renewed offensive. “It is a mistake to try to predict a logical development of the situation – you need to take your paradigm and insert into it a sick man with a sick worldview and imperial ambitions,” he said. “You think he’s going to be satisfied with some compromise? No, never. Only when he’s fully defeated.”",News/World news,‘The Russians are trying to obliterate us.

4/10/2022,"A member of the far-right Proud Boys group has pleaded guilty to conspiring to attack the US Capitol in a bid to stop Congress certifying Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, giving prosecutors a win in their pursuit of high-ranking members. As part of an agreement with prosecutors that will require him to cooperate against co-defendants, Charles Donohoe, 34, pleaded guilty on Friday in US district court in Washington to charges of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding and assaulting Capitol police. The North Carolina native could face up to 28 years in prison. However, citing federal sentencing guidelines, prosecutors estimated in court records he would serve six or seven years. The judge, Timothy Kelly, did not immediately set a sentencing date. Five co-defendants, including well-known group members Enrique Tarrio and Dominic Pezzola, are tentatively scheduled to go to trial in May. In December, Matthew Greene of New York became the first Proud Boys member to admit to a role in the plot to attack the Capitol, as part of a deal with prosecutors. Greene also agreed to cooperate with authorities. According to prosecutors, on 6 January, Donohoe was among at least 100 Proud Boys who marched from the “Save America” rally near the White House to the Capitol in hope of derailing Congress’ certification of Biden’s victory over Donald Trump. Donohoe held a high rank in the group. In the days leading up to the rally, he, Tarrio and others used encrypted messaging apps to discuss organizing a “Ministry of Self Defense” that would invade the Capitol. After arriving at the building, Donohoe threw two water bottles at and pushed past a line of police officers who tried to stop the mob, prosecutors wrote in a summary of the case that Donohoe endorsed. Donohoe took a picture of Pezzola holding a riot shield just outside the Capitol, bragging in a message to other members of the militia: “Got a riot shield.” The group made it inside after Pezzola allegedly broke a window, prompting Donohoe to send other messages boasting, “We stormed the capitol unarmed” and “took it over unarmed” because “the people are … done”. A bipartisan Senate report connected seven deaths to the riot, which temporarily slowed certification of Biden’s win as lawmakers fled. About 140 police officers were injured. Authorities have charged more than 800 people in connection with the attack, with one particularly high-profile case filed in federal court in Washington taking aim at Donohoe, Tarrio – who was not at the Capitol on 6 January – Pezzola and three other Proud Boys members. Donohoe has been held in federal detention since his arrest in March last year. Tarrio, Pezzola, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl have pleaded not guilty and for now intend to go to trial, beginning 18 May. All six defendants are also named in a pending federal lawsuit from the District of Columbia which demands damages from the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, another far-right group, over the Capitol attack.",News/US news,Proud Boys member pleads guilty to role in US Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/09/proud-boys-member-guilty-january-6-capitol-attack
4/10/2022,"Thomas Tuchel said the impact of telling his Chelsea squad some home truths was clear after watching his side eviscerate Southampton 6-0 to bounce back from successive defeats and raise hopes of keeping their Champions League quarter-final tie against Real Madrid alive. Tuchel held frank discussions with his players on Thursday after the 3-1 defeat to Real at Stamford Bridge and demanded a sharpness, which they exhibited as goals from Marcos Alonso, Kai Havertz and two apiece from Mason Mount and Timo Werner routed a subpar Southampton. Victory marked the perfect riposte after conceding a total of seven goals in defeats to Brentford and Real. Chelsea, who made four changes, led 6-0 after 54 minutes and Southampton moved to a three-man defence in an attempt to halt the scoring. Chelsea play the return leg in Madrid on Tuesday. “It was necessary that we turned things around,” Tuchel said. “It was not a huge turnaround – it was not necessary to change everything – but it was a moment for us. The feeling was a moment to tell the group the truth, my honest opinion, and tell them as a part of the group: ‘This is how I feel.’ “The message was clear and obviously everybody took it in the right way. I included myself in the message and so it was necessary to step up. It is on the players to live up to what we play. They did it in an impressive manner and it is now a time to move on because we’ve found what makes us strong.” The Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, alluded to previous 9-0 defeats to Leicester and Manchester United and conceded his team appeared lost after 15 minutes, by which point they trailed 2-0. “I was disappointed to see that we fell back into behaviour that I thought was gone,” he said. “It seems we have to have one game of this every season and it is very hard to take. This team kills you when you have a chance. They show you [your] every weakness.” Werner scored his first league goals since October and Tuchel said the striker’s statement performance was reminder that he is “still an important player of this club and group”. The Chelsea captain, César Azpilicueta, missed the game after testing positive for Covid-19 while Tuchel hinted that the record signing Romelu Lukaku would not return from an achilles injury in time for Madrid. “Time is running [out], we leave the country again on Monday,” he said.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel says Chelsea have turned things around after home truths,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/thomas-tuchel-says-chelsea-have-turned-things-around-after-home-truths
4/10/2022,"Sometimes the dead have more to say than the living. Those lying beneath the soft, yellow earth in the grounds of the church of Andrew the Apostle, in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, have many terrible stories to tell. In a deep mass grave, a forearm and hand, the fingertips turning black, lay under a foot at a sickening angle; another man’s arm looked like it was clawing its way out of the disturbed soil in an attempt to escape his fate. On Friday morning a team of forensic investigators from Kyiv arrived at the site to begin documenting the horrors inflicted on civilians by Russian troops during Moscow’s six-week-old invasion. They strapped a door to a municipal digger to create a makeshift gurney, and got to work. All of the people they uncovered had died violently. One man was missing a large chunk of his skull; another body was so badly burned only his head and half of his torso remained, the whites of his eyes subsumed by charred flesh. One person appeared to have been beheaded. As each new cadaver was laid in front of him, the lead investigator knelt over it and softly murmured an inventory while a colleague wrote it down: leather jacket, mobile phone, no ID. He checked inside decaying mouths, the range of motion of broken limbs, and documented burns, bullet wounds and injuries caused by shrapnel, before volunteers from the town helped put each corpse into a fresh body bag. Their pink and blue plastic gloves were soon slick with blood. Between bodies, the workers plunged their hands into the metre-high pile of dirt taken out of the grave so far, rubbing clumps of it between their palms to restore their grip. By the end of the day, the team had exhumed 18 corpses. But many more missing people of Bucha are waiting to be found. A wealthy northwest Kyiv commuter town before the conflict began, the name of Bucha is now synonymous with Russian war crimes. After a month of fighting, its soldiers embrangled at positions about 40km northeast and northwest of the capital and unable to advance, Bucha was one of the first places that Moscow pulled back from to reconcentrate its forces on Ukraine’s east. The scale of the violence against civilians which took place here – murders, rapes, torture, looting – is horrifying. “The morgue had no electricity and it quickly became full. There were still so many bodies on the streets,” said Serhiy Kaplychnyy, who oversees funerals and death registrations for the Bucha municipality. “We had to beg the Russians to let us bury them. They told us it was still cold, so it didn’t matter, they could lie there. But the dogs were starting to eat them. In the end we convinced them it was a sanitary issue and they let us dig the grave at the church of Andrew the Apostle since it was near both their military position and the morgue and hospital.” The first tranche of bodies numbered around 70, several locals said. Then there was a second mass burial of another 33 people. In total, around 150 civilians are believed to be lying in the church site. A group of around two dozen Bucha residents were waiting on the other side of the church on Friday for the bodies of their loved ones to be unearthed. Ludmyla Skakalova, a paramedic with a drawn, exhausted face, said she was one of only four people left working at the town’s hospital after their last doctor was injured, and that the hospital had opened its doors to wounded Russians, too. “The soldiers also targeted us,” she said. “Once the Russians called and said there was an emergency, to lure out one of the ambulance drivers and someone from the territorial defence. Then a sniper shot them. The driver died.” Snipers shot civilians in the legs as they tried to get water at a well, killing at least one woman, said Tatyana Lipinska, a volunteer at the Bucha city council helpline, and abducted at least one volunteer delivering medicine to elderly people. Kukharenko Vyacheslav, a large man of 47 with a soft voice and bright blue eyes, spent most of the day crying quietly next to the grave. He was not looking for a loved one. He felt guilty, he said, tortured by what he described as his own “cowardice” in the face of the invasion, and felt the need to bear witness. “Volunteers from a nearby village tried to come help us, and the Russians shot them in the street. Then my neighbour went out to help, and they killed him too,” he said. “We were 11 children and 10 adults all hiding in a basement, and I was so afraid the youngest baby would cry and let the Russians know where we were.” Three days later, Vyacheslav talked to a group of soldiers for an hour when they came to look at the household’s passports. “I asked them, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and they replied that it was just orders. They knew that other units were killing civilians, but said it wasn’t them,” he said. “They said we are brothers. What kind of brother arrives at your home on a tank and shoots your neighbour?” he said. “I think they were even afraid of each other.” Haylena Fiaktistava, 70, was among those hoping to find answers in the mass grave. She spent the occupation sheltering at home with her two sons, Dmitro and Andrei, but one day Dmitro left the house to try and find bread, and never came back. During a respite in the shelling three days later, Haylena and Andrei went out and found him lying face down in the middle of the road a few streets away, bullet holes in his back. Another relative helped Andrei to take Dmitro’s body to the morgue, but it was full. Not sure what else to do, they left him under the small white building’s awning. Later, they heard that all of the bodies at the morgue had been buried in the church grounds. “We wrote his name and address on a piece of paper and put it inside one of his socks so we can find him again,” she said. “I just want to give him a proper funeral.” When satellite pictures of the mass grave at the church of Andrew the Apostle emerged earlier this week, before Ukrainian troops reentered the town, the Kremlin was quick to deny the atrocities committed here. Footage and photographs of dead civilians had been “ordered” by the US to sully Moscow’s reputation, Russia’s foreign ministry said. Events at the Bucha church on Friday gave an irrefutable truth to the Kremlin’s lies. A military chaplain arrived soon after the exhumation of the mass grave began. He put a stole on over his fatigues and held a wooden cross while he blessed the pit with holy water and sang an Orthodox memorial service. Anna Stefaniuk, along with her husband Volodymyr and mother Natalia Lukyanenko, silently watched the investigators work. Stefaniuk was missing her brother, Lukyanenko’s son; Volodymyr was also missing a brother. The family were simultaneously desperate for answers, and afraid of what the grave might tell them. As the fourth body bag was unzipped and shown to the mourners, Volodymyr let out a harrowing cry and collapsed on the ground. The grave had given up one of its many secrets: his brother’s remains were among the tangle of tortured limbs and bloodied faces. A biting wind blew as he covered his face and sobbed. Anna leaned over him, touching her head to his. Springtime birdsong echoed down from the church’s tall arches. Near the gate to the grounds, blue and yellow crocus buds were beginning to force their way up through the soil, the first blooms of a Ukrainian spring like no other.",News/World news,"With bloodied gloves, forensic teams uncover gruesome secrets of Bucha in Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/with-bloodied-gloves-forensic-teams-uncover-gruesome-secrets-of-bucha-in-ukraine
