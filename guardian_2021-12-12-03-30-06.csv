12/12/2021,"Further evidence alleging that the government seriously mishandled the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been handed to a parliamentary inquiry examining the operation, the Observer has been told. Details from several government departments and agencies are understood to back damning testimony from a Foreign Office whistleblower, who has claimed that bureaucratic chaos, ministerial intervention, and a lack of planning and resources led to “people being left to die at the hands of the Taliban”.  The Observer revealed in August that thousands of emails of urgent cases of Afghans in danger were being left unread for days at the height of the crisis, with the messages of senior MPs among those not to be opened. Even government ministers had emails that had not been addressed. In an interview with the Observer, Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee which is examining the claims, said others had been in touch to disclose concerns. He described evidence from three senior Foreign Office officials last Tuesday, in which its permanent secretary Sir Philip Barton admitted remaining on holiday for 11 days after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, as “completely extraordinary”. He said he was now more convinced about the damning testimony his committee received from Raphael Marshall, a junior official who worked in the Afghan Special Cases team. “There’s nothing I’ve heard that leads me to believe he is mistaken,” Tugendhat said. “He and many like him deserve more than an apology. They have demonstrated quite clearly the integrity and the ethical standards we should expect from senior government employees, but are finding those standards in the junior ranks, not the senior ones.” Tugendhat said that his committee was now sifting through further evidence. “Since the hearing on Tuesday, I’ve been approached by individuals from other government departments and, indeed, other agencies offering their own perspectives on the events in the run-up to August and the aftermath,” he said. “We’re in discussion as to how their evidence may be presented. There is a very wide feeling that this goes to the heart of something that is simply not acceptable, and that Britain deserves better.” He said the committee would be speaking to defence secretary Ben Wallace over the military elements of the withdrawal. “We’re very keen to speak to the defence secretary who has agreed to come,” he said. “We want to hear the military perspective on this. We’re very keen to speak to others who may have been involved in different areas. And we need to sit down and go through a lot of evidence.” Tugendhat said that he wanted to wait for a final report on the crisis before concluding where the responsibility for any failings should fall. However, he said that it was a “whole government” failure, with the Foreign Office, Home Office and Ministry of Defence all involved in the operation. He said the failure had seen allies in Afghanistan abandoned. “There are many people on the ground in Afghanistan today who are guilty of nothing more than hoping and wishing for a better future,” he said. “Yet today, the Taliban victory means what we’re likely to see is a very serious degradation in the life chances of individuals. In many ways we’re already seeing it. We’re seeing girls denied education, we’re seeing women excluded from work. These are very serious attacks on civil liberties.” He said that questions remained over the evacuation of nearly 200 dogs and cats from Kabul. Pen Farthing, a former British Royal Marine who operated the Nowzad animal charity, flew with the animals in a chartered aircraft. However, Marshall said that finite resources on the ground had to be deployed to ensure the animals reached the plane. “The Foreign Office officials made it clear that there was absolutely no diversion of resources,” said Tugendhat. “They also made it clear that the military opened the gates and took time to get those animals in. How those two statements are compatible, I don’t understand.” A government spokesperson said: “UK government staff worked tirelessly to evacuate more than 15,000 people from Afghanistan within a fortnight. This was the biggest mission of its kind in generations and the second largest evacuation carried out by any country. We are still working to help others leave. “Over 1,000 FCDO staff worked to help British nationals and eligible Afghans leave during Operation Pitting. The scale of the evacuation and the challenging circumstances meant decisions on prioritisation had to be made quickly to ensure we could help as many people as possible. Regrettably we were not able to evacuate all those we wanted to, but our commitment to them is enduring and since the end of the operation we’ve helped more than 3,000 individuals leave Afghanistan.”",News/World news,Fresh evidence on UK’s botched Afghan withdrawal backs whistleblower’s story ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/11/fresh-evidence-on-uks-botched-afghan-withdrawal-backs-whistleblowers-story
12/12/2021,"Marcus Rashford, 24, plays football for England and Manchester United and is the author of this year’s bestselling children’s nonfiction book, You Are a Champion, written with the journalist Carl Anka to inspire young people to reach their full potential. One of five siblings raised by a single mother on minimum wage in Manchester, Rashford has become one of Britain’s leading campaigners against child poverty. In June he launched the Marcus Rashford Book Club in conjunction with Magic Breakfast and Macmillan Children’s Books to encourage a lifelong love of reading and give free books to underprivileged children. Next year, Rashford will release his first children’s fiction book, The Breakfast Club Adventures, co-authored by Alex Falase-Koya. What effect has your book club had so far?I visited Button Lane a few weeks ago; it’s my old primary school and a recipient of my book club. It was brilliant to see the children’s faces light up when they talked about books, and each and every one of them had taken something slightly different away from their reading. They were engaged, and that is what we’re looking for – for children to use books as an escape when faced with daily challenges; to be inspired, motivated and ultimately dream about what they could be one day. The one thing that stood out for me, though, was how their aspirations had changed since the club first launched. Then, most of the children told me they wanted to be a footballer like me. Now, we have children dreaming of being artists, architects, vets. It’s just brilliant. That’s what I wanted. The belief that they can be anything they want to be.  Tell us a bit about the books you chose for the club this year…For me, the books are actually secondary to the bigger picture when we go through the selection process. I’m looking for authors and illustrators to inspire the children – creatives who have come from similar backgrounds, are of the same race, religion… all of that is important. I want to put these writers on a pedestal and show children that although they came from a similar place, a similar background, they have made a great career for themselves doing what they love, and where they grew up has not stunted them. That said, the first two books we chose are brilliant – Pooja Puri’s A Dinosaur Ate My Sister, which is wonderfully illustrated by Allen Fatimaharan, and Tom Percival’s Silas and the Marvellous Misfits. They are both full of adventure and have been really well received by the children at Button Lane. In your book You Are a Champion, there’s a chapter called Never Stop Learning. Can you tell us three things, big or small, that you have learned this year?Oof, OK, let me think about this one. I learned basic skills in the kitchen thanks to [the chef] Tom Kerridge. I only really began cooking this year when I launched Full Time Meals with Tom. It’s designed to help children and adults find their confidence in the kitchen on limited budgets and with limited equipment. It was created to support the uptake of the Healthy Start scheme but is really an opportunity for families to spend some valuable time together in the kitchen when day trips or activities are limited by budget. I also learned and understood the power of my voice and my platform to support others, and to be more thankful for what I had, given how quickly it can be taken away through injury and pandemics. I try to learn something new every day, but I’d say these are three that stand out. What is the best/most memorable feedback you’ve had about your book?I was sat with a little boy the other day at Button Lane, and when I asked him what he had taken away from You Are a Champion he told me about the importance of being kind, and if he could be kind, how he could teach others to be the same. A dream of mine has always been to encourage more compassion in the next generation so that they champion their differences, instead of highlighting them to divide, so hearing that was just brilliant. I try to do regular insight sessions with the children so I can understand what they need in a book. You Are a Champion wasn’t written to win awards – it was created to help a child like me develop the tools to navigate through their daily challenges, but I’m really proud to see how it has been received by children of all backgrounds. Who or what got you into reading?I didn’t actually start reading until I was 17. We didn’t have books at home, nor did we have the environment to read books. My mum worked three jobs, so I found my freedom outside kicking a ball around. It was hard for me to engage with books at the time. Very few characters looked like me, and my life was far from a fairytale. That experience set the foundations for what we needed from the book club – representation, acceptance and acknowledgment. Every child should pick up these books and feel like they were written for them. The first book that really locked me in was Relentless by Tim Grover. It was a different type of book focused on mentality, and exactly what I needed when I was breaking in to the first team. I still read the book every couple of months and mark it to track my progress. In the book and in life you come across as somebody who faces each day full of positivity. What’s your morning routine – what things do you do to best set yourself up for the day?It would be wrong to say I’m always positive, especially given how my mood can be dictated by a football result, but I do always try to find the positives in whatever situation I’m facing. I’m living out my dream, and given where I came from there isn’t really a lot I can now complain about. I’m grateful for the position I’ve found myself in. One of the biggest lessons I took from Relentless was never to allow my mood to get too high, because it means the lows are that much lower, and that’s definitely the case in my job. If my mood was determined by the football result, I’d be up and down like a rollercoaster. Most players stick to a routine in the morning, which is the case for me. I like routine and it hasn’t changed much since I was young. I get up, I head to training, I have breakfast, I train. Very straightforward. On a day off I will wake up, have breakfast, do a bit of recovery and then maybe take the dogs for a walk. Breakfast features a few times in your book – Weetabix as a kid; your nana’s unbeatable corn porridge… What is your breakfast of champions today?It doesn’t really differ from when I was a child, to be honest. Weetabix, cornflakes, Coco Pops – or if I’m feeling a little adventurous I’ll have fried egg and toast, which I pick up at the training ground. Again, I love a routine. What are your books of the year?Well obviously, my book club choices. But additionally, I love what Lenny Henry has done with The Boy With Wings. It’s a fun superhero adventure story for children that’s representative of all children. It’s also illustrated by Keenon Ferrell, who is great.What are you reading at the moment?Carl Anka, who wrote You Are a Champion with me, actually got me Phil Jackson’s Eleven Rings for my birthday, so I’ve been enjoying reading that. How are you spending Christmas and what are your main memories of Christmas when you were a kid?While you’re playing football you don’t really have a “traditional” Christmas. We typically train or are in a hotel that day because there are so many fixtures, so we’ll get to see family for a couple of hours then it’s straight back to work. It’s not something I feel I’m missing out on, as we didn’t really have the traditional Christmas when I was young. We didn’t really have gifts. The important thing was that we were together. Mum used to queue around the block outside the food bank for a Christmas dinner, and we really made the best of what we had, which is a credit to her. We never wanted Mum to feel the pressure of Christmas, so we just enjoyed it for what it was. The togetherness and family are probably the things I miss on the day at the moment, but we have plenty of opportunities to make up for it. What are you looking forward to next year?It’s a big football year so I’m looking forward to everything that that brings. I have my first fiction book, The Breakfast Club Adventures, launching in May, which I’m really excited about. Breakfast club was a safe haven for me, and I wanted to capture the unity and togetherness of that space. A space where my lifelong friendships were formed. A space that started our day the right way, with energy and adventure. I’m working on that at the moment with my co-author, Alex Falase-Koya, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the children react to it. I’m also looking forward to seeing how You Are a Champion is received in the United States, as we launch it there on 7 June.How would you like to be remembered?As someone who never forgot where he came from. As someone who used the platform his career gave him to highlight inequalities and bring opportunity to those that truly needed it.Who are your heroes/heroines?My mum.

12/12/2021,"The past never stops informing the future and the greats never forget their past. With seven titles under his belt, history echoes long for Lewis Hamilton as he enters the finale of a Formula One world championship balanced on a knife edge. Hamilton has never forgotten how hard he had to work to come so far and how the character of the man who races in Abu Dhabi on Sunday was forged in the crucible of competition he experienced as a young karter. Back then there was no guarantee he would be the kid who made it but the traits that have brought him to such remarkable heights were unmistakable.  Hamilton can take a record eighth championship if he wins at the Yas Marina circuit. He is tied with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen on points. The pressure is immense, and it is instructive that heading into this season’s decisive races the world champion has been watching videos of some of his old karting competitions. “Those have been my favourite races,” he said. He admits that memories of many of his F1 races are hazy, while many of his battles in karting are still vivid. Those years were hard but formative in both his long-term success and how he has faced down Verstappen’s challenge. Jonny Restrick was Hamilton’s mechanic in 1998 when the driver was 13 and even then saw a future champion in the personable but fiercely determined kid. “We had races where things had gone wrong and his performances were phenomenal. He would find the next level,” Restrick says. “Today you think he is doing the best he can and then his back is against the wall and he finds that other level. There is not a bone in his body that would know how to give up.” Colin Brown experienced the sharp end of this fearsome combination of talent and resolve. Brown was a gifted karter, headhunted to race in Europe. A title-winner who raced from the age of 12, he took the Italian championship at the first time of asking when he went there in 1994, making his mark in competitive fields including factory drivers. In 2000 he came up against Hamilton in the Formula A class and it was touted as the two best young British drivers going head to head. Brown immediately recognised his opponent’s spirit. “Sometimes you make a move on drivers, you mentally boss their minds, get in their heads so they become weak, they get nervous so they won’t overtake,” he says. “Lewis was the one kid I raced against who you could never do that to. I would pass him, look behind and he would come back at me. I thought: ‘I can’t get rid of this guy, no matter what I do he always comes back at me.’” This year Hamilton has shown the same steely strength of will. Verstappen tried to boss him but he was having none of it, ensuring the title fight has gone to the wire. At the final race of the year in 2000, the World Cup at the Motegi circuit in Japan, Brown came from 52nd in qualifying after an engine problem, worked his way through the heats and started in third for the final. He and Hamilton vied for the lead throughout and Brown thought he had it only to leave a slender opening on the last lap. Hamilton shot up the inside and took the win. It was hard but Brown only admires the way Hamilton drove, with the sportsmanship he has displayed throughout his career. “Considering I came from 52nd and led on the last lap, that is still really painful,” he says. “However, I am very proud to this day that I raced against Lewis. He was a very fair driver, not a dirty driver. If somebody pushed me about on track I would hit them up the arse, give them a little lesson. He never did that, he was never aggressive to the point that he would hit someone on the track, he was very, very fair.” Two years earlier Restrick remembers a fun but humble Hamilton, a natural athlete, skilled with a football and with a golf club when the mechanics took him for his first swing at a driving range. He was no engineer but was relentless in his focus on anything that would make him go faster. His team, usually all packed into the Vauxhall Cavalier of his father, Anthony, were the first to arrive at the track and the last to leave. Even then Hamilton inspired those around him. “He motivated everybody to want to win,” says Restrick. Restrick had considered putting on a bet that Hamilton would make it to F1, two years later win races and two years after that be champion. Yet Hamilton’s eventual rise occurred with even greater alacrity than he had foreseen. At the Fulbeck circuit in 1998 Restrick was watching him into turn one off the start. He expected the worst as he saw Hamilton lining up what appeared to be an impossible pass. “I was thinking: ‘There’s no way that’s going to work,’ but he had read the situation and sent it,” he remembers. “He made several places in turn one. The hairs on my arms still stand up thinking of that move. The big thing was his ability to overtake, that was immediately apparent. By the end of the year I was as convinced as he was that he was going to F1. He never talked about ‘if’, all the conversation about the future was ‘when I am in Formula One’.” Hamilton then began racing in Europe but Restrick could not follow due to university commitments. He went on to work in engineering and has now unpacked his tool box again to work with his son Jonty in karting. Still a fan, Restrick will be celebrating should Hamilton secure his eighth title. “It’s just great to see him do it and in my little way to have played a part in it,” he says. Brown endured harder times and could not have veered further from Hamilton’s path. His racing career ground to a halt when he was misled by a management company who failed to find him a drive, and by his own admission he went off the rails and suffered severe depression. Now 39, he turned his life around after the birth of his daughter and coaches young karters. He too feels only pleased to have played a small role in Hamilton’s rich past on the eve of what might be his old rival’s greatest triumph. “Some people could be bitter but I am the opposite,” he says. “When my daughter grows up I can tell her: ‘That’s the most famous race driver of all time and I raced him.’ I am just proud to have been on the track dicing with him, it’s nice to have been a part of that.”",Sport/Sport,‘He never got nervous or weak’: the making of Lewis Hamilton,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/karting-colleagues-recall-steel-of-young-lewis-hamilton
12/12/2021,"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. England started work on theirs two years ago. “Job No 1 is to help Joe to keep moving forward so that in two years’ time we can go to Australia and make a real impact,” said Chris Silverwood in his first press conference after he took over as England’s head coach. Usually it’s the players and coaches who say the press talk about the Ashes to the exclusion of everything else. This year it’s been the other way around: Silverwood has come back to his plans for this winter again, and again and again.  He did it in March when explaining the team’s rotation policy during their 3-1 loss in India. “We talk about working our way towards the Ashes and I want the squad to arrive there fit and in form,” he said. “We want to make sure everyone arrives at that point in as good a place as possible.” He did it again in May, before they lost 1-0 at home to New Zealand. “We want to travel to Australia fitter, faster, leaner, more ready than ever before, so we get off the plane and it is ‘Right, we’re here, we mean business, and we’re full of confidence, and that will take us through.’ ” The BBC even turned out a six‑part podcast – “Project Ashes” – detailing all the backroom planning that has gone on, the selection and rotation, the hotels, the training venues, the diet, the strength and conditioning, the Lions squad (who are being battered by Australia A). In one episode their performance director, Mo Bobat, explained the approach for the first Test: “There’s no debating Australia have a formidable record at the Gabba, you can be intimidated by that or you can frame it as ‘they depend on winning at the Gabba to win their series’. Frame it as a challenge. Get something from that game and Australia are in difficult territory, territory they are not used to.” At the end of it all, England ended up leaving out their two senior pros, James Anderson and Stuart Broad, so they could open the attack with two men, Chris Woakes and Ollie Robinson, who have never taken the new ball together, and include a spinner, Jack Leach, who hasn’t bowled in Test cricket in nine months because they didn’t trust him to play all summer, and an all-rounder, Ben Stokes, who hasn’t batted since he faced seven balls in the Hundred in July. Then they got themselves in such a tangle over what to do after the toss that they ended up missing out on the best bowling conditions of the match and were rolled for 147 after winning it. There is a lot to unpick in all this. If the BBC needed six episodes for the run-up, they’ll take 12 for the debrief. There is Covid, of course, and the quarantine restrictions which meant they had to rest and rotate their players, the persistent rain in Australia, which spoiled their practice matches, injuries to Jofra Archer, Olly Stone, and Stokes, the calamitous drop-off in the form of Dom Sibley, Zak Crawley, and Dom Bess, who they had invested so much hope in over the last year. But at the bottom of it all there is a bigger problem. It feels like England have confused having a plan with being prepared. Because a lot of this, the weather, the injuries, the poor form, are exactly the sort of problems you ought to expect in sport, and which a well-run team should be able to work around. Plans change. If you’re well prepared, you cope. That doesn’t necessarily mean they would win, just that they wouldn’t lose by nine wickets in three days and three hours of play. England didn’t succeed in Australia in 2010-11 just because they had dotted every i on the schedule, but because over the year running up to the series they had developed a resilience, and a sense of resolve that meant they didn’t fold when they found themselves 221 runs behind after the first innings of the series. That strength comes from the character of the players, and the culture of the team. This England squad has plenty of matchwinners in it, but do they have the conviction, cohesion, and culture which marks India’s cricket at the moment, or which allows New Zealand to become the world’s No 1 Test team on such slender means? England may still find their way back into this series. It’s possible. But if they do, it will be because someone among them has become today’s hero. Usually it’s Joe Root. In the past 12 months, England have won four Tests. Root has top-scored (and been the only century-maker) in every one of them. But it could be Broad, or Anderson or Stokes, who have all done it before. The last time England turned in a genuine team performance was their victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in August 2020, when three batsmen made fifties and six bowlers took at least two wickets each. The trouble with this way of doing things is you’ve nowhere to go if the hero doesn’t show. And you certainly can’t make a plan around it.",Sport/Sport,Dismal England look to have confused having a plan with being prepared | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/11/dismal-england-australia-ashes-confused-having-plan-being-prepared
12/12/2021,"For two months, one of the women attending Anab Hoffmann’s weekly drop-in sessions was very vocal in her opposition to vaccines of all kinds. “She was one of the loudest,” Hoffmann said. “There’s always one. She was very loud. But we didn’t mind. That was her view. We don’t want to tell people they are wrong. We just want to give them the evidence.”  Hoffmann is the founder of Heal Together, a community interest company that focuses on helping London’s Somali community understand and access mental health support. They run a “Shaah and Sheeko” [tea and chat] group on Thursdays at various places in east London where people can talk about anything they are concerned about. Hoffman and her colleagues show people how to get help. Since July, they have also been talking about vaccines – one of hundreds of “community champions” who are trying to persuade people to get the jab. People like the vocal anti-vaxxer at the Shaah and Sheeko. “Week in, week out, she was very reluctant, but we saw her soften her tone.” They showed her videos of Somali doctors talking about vaccines, and information about the different vaccines and what they do.“We’re a small community,” said Hoffmann, who gave up her job in human resources for a major bank to start up Heal Together. “But we have unexplained levels of autism and some people believe the MMR vaccinations are responsible, which is untrue. But it has been a problem. “Then a few weeks ago, we were doing outreach work outside a mosque and we saw her. She hugged all of us. I was perplexed, to say the least, because she had been so against it. But she said she had got the vaccine, and her sisters too.” Even though everyone over 18 has been eligible for a free vaccine for at least six months, more than 60,000 adults received their first dose in the week up to 5 December, according to NHS figures. In the London borough of Newham, where Heal Together is based, more than 220,000 first doses have been given out to over-18s, but there are between 268,000 and 350,000 adults in the area. The local authority has been funding 15 community groups including Heal Together and about 8,000 people have been vaccinated at pop-up clinics, like one Hoffmann ran in Stratford in June. Jason Strelitz, director of public health in Newham, said there had been an increase in unvaccinated people coming forward since the emergence of the new, more infectious the Omicron variant. “We’ve been working a lot with very small community and voluntary organisations who have deep roots into different communities,” he said. “Breaking down trust barriers is important.” Around 10% of people in their 40s are yet to have any vaccine against Covid-19, according to NHS figures, which leaves them vulnerable to serious illness if they become infected. More than a quarter of men aged between 18 and 24 are unvaccinated, nearly six months after they were first offered. Since the government’s strategy of avoiding Covid restrictions relies on a herd immunity approach, these unvaccinated people represent a significant problem. When Boris Johnson announced plan B measures last week, he hinted that mandatory vaccinations might be an option, saying a “national conversation” was needed. Vaccines are already mandatory for care home workers – although a grace period has been extended into next year – and frontline NHS workers will be obliged to be double jabbed by April. But the prospect of mandatory vaccines was “worrying”, according to Dr Pauline Paterson, co-director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). “We might need boosters every six months,” she said. “How many doses will be mandatory?” LSHTM researchers conducted a study of 17,000 people in April and discovered that although people who had been vaccinated liked the idea of vaccine passports, those who were already hesitant became more reluctant. But confidence, or a lack of trust in the vaccines, or authorities, is only one reason why some people are unvaccinated, Paterson said. They may be complacent – particularly young people who believe they are not vulnerable to Covid, or there may be a lack of access. “Maybe some people tried to log into the system and it wasn’t working. Or they didn’t know their NHS number, or the centre is too far away,” Paterson said. “Usually, by the time you have systems in place to make vaccines mandatory, you don’t need to, because generally the problem is about access. “There’s an assumption we need to educate people, or tell them off, but actually we need to find out why people haven’t had a vaccine. The key is not to stigmatise and not to assume.” Access remains a problem for some, including immune-suppressed people who need a third primary dose of the vaccine but say there is no way to book a vaccine appointment. They also face resistance from volunteers who do not always understand that they are eligible for a jab. Even 15% of over-80s eligible for a booster dose have not yet had it, nearly three months after being invited. Changes to the way vaccines are now delivered may mean it is harder for some to access, according to Ruthe Isden, Age UK’s head of influence. “In January, people were furloughed so they were more able to drop everything and take relatives to vaccine centres. In older age groups, people do face practical barriers. And for housebound people we do need wraparound support.”",News/World news,‘We don’t want to tell people they are wrong’: the battle to win over Britain’s unvaccinated,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/11/we-dont-want-to-tell-people-they-are-wrong-the-battle-to-win-over-britains-unvaccinated
12/12/2021,"From Ikea to meatballs, hygge to Nordic noir, Scandinavia’s influence on the UK has been rising steadily for decades. But this Christmas, amid the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, enthusiasm for the region and its traditions is hitting new heights. Scandinavian goods distributor ScandiKitchen closed online Christmas orders early this year after unprecedented demand for festive products including meatballs, glögg (mulled wine), pepparkakor (ginger biscuits), chocolate, ham and cheese.  And it’s not just food that’s popular. Britain is embracing the festival of St Lucia – a candlelit celebration held on 13 December in schools, workplaces and homes across Sweden. Community group LondonSwedes said tickets for their Lyric Hammersmith event, starring Swedish Eurovision winner Måns Zelmerlöw, sold out in two hours. Meanwhile, the Swedish Church said tickets for all of its Lucia celebrations in London and Brighton sold out weeks ago, earlier than ever. York Minster’s Lucia celebration is also fully booked. Decorations, too, are taking cues from Scandinavia this year. Ikea reports rising interest in handmade decorations, cooking and baking as people embrace home life nearly two years into the pandemic. It said shoppers had been buying decorations “sooner than usual”. The Scandinavian homeware store Nordic House said it had had a “huge rise” in demand for Christmas decorations, especially candles. Co-founder Sandie Wallman said the Scandinavian trend reflected the move towards sustainability, supporting artisans and the handmade. “Scandi style is the opposite of a throwaway society, which people are understandably looking for now,” said Wallman. “Beautiful Scandi decorations are a calming antidote to the hectic and uncertain year we’ve had.” Brontë Aurell, co-owner of ScandiKitchen, said: “We’re always busy at Christmas, and we always run out of capacity near the time, but never this early.” Fears among homesick Scandinavians over travel restrictions after the government’s “plan B” announcement in response to Omicron and Brexit-related importing complications had contributed to demand, she said, as well as the pandemic generally, which she thought had increased the attraction of Scandinavian traditions and values for non-Scandinavians. “We have a very strong Christmas culture that is endearing – and easily sits alongside British Christmas traditions,” she said. “We are all about baking, mulled wine, hygge, being outside but also cosying up inside. And, most importantly, taking time out to be with those we love – being present. If we have all learned one thing during these past two years, it is that being together completes us as humans.” Aurell said Britain’s relationship with Scandinavia had “moved on from Ikea meatballs and Nordic noir. The British people overall have a much better knowledge of what Nordic countries can offer and what our culture’s like. And I think a lot of people look to that.” Charlotte Ågren, founder of LondonSwedes, said last year’s Christmas lockdown had increased demand for their events this year, which, as well as marking Lucia, also included a midsummer celebration and a crayfish party. “It feels like the culture’s just getting more exciting and interesting,” she said. She believes the announcement of plans to open an Ikea on Oxford Street in 2023, Abba’s return and the growing presence of Scandinavian languages and culture on Netflix have all contributed. In another sign of the region’s growing influence, Vogue Scandinavia launched this year, published in English and with Greta Thunberg photographed stroking a horse on the cover of its first edition. Niklas Ekstedt, a Michelin-starred Swedish chef who opened Ekstedt at The Yard, his first restaurant outside Stockholm, in Westminster earlier this year, said he was pleased that Scandinavian influence was moving away from The Bridge and Ingmar Bergman. “People are seeing that there are other things in the culture than death and darkness,” he said, adding that Scandinavian Christmas festivities “travel really well to England”. He said the oldest food on the Swedish julbord (Christmas table) – which usually includes pickled herring, gravadlax, Christmas ham and rice pudding – is dopp i grytan, a broth to dip bread into. Scandinavia’s darker winters made Christmas extra important, he said. “When we come into this dark period of very short days and cold weather, the holiday season is so important for the family to keep the mood up. So a lot of things are really thought through to make sure that everyone is happy, the food is good, and we can survive another couple of months with the winter.” The fastest route to a Scandi-style Christmas is to light up your home and embrace hygge (roughly translated from Danish as “cosiness”), says ScandiKitchen founder Brontë Aurell. She also recommends making your own glögg (1 cinnamon stick, 10 cardamom pods, 20 cloves, 5-7g dried ginger, 5g dried orange peel, 80g sugar and a bottle of red wine that you heat, rest, strain and then reheat to serve with a spoonful of flaked almonds) and holding a glögg gathering with friends and neighbours on the Sundays of advent. Or try making ginger biscuits or a gingerbread house – either from scratch or using a pre-made flatpack base. Dates to celebrate include St Lucia, on 13 December, and 24 December, with a special meal, perhaps a smörgåsbord, and dancing around the Christmas tree.",News/UK news,"Hygge, glögg and pepparkakor... why we’re all falling for a Scandi Christmas",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/11/hygge-glogg-and-pepparkakor-why-were-all-falling-for-a-scandi-christmas
12/12/2021,"There was a time when we would not have been surprised by Leicester dominance, but so fresh is this second coming of the Tigers that each new height reattained seems of note. Here, in the lair of the French leaders, no less, they continued their unbeaten start to the season with an opening win against Bordeaux. George Ford, whose masterful first half subsided into an error-strewn third quarter, rediscovered the best of himself when it mattered to land the winning penalty with less than five minutes remaining. Leicester had generally held the upper hand, particularly in the first half, but midway through the second they were in material danger of a first defeat. That they pulled themselves together to claim a win, in the absence of a host of frontline players, gives notice of the renewed confidence at Welford Road.  More experienced sides than this have found many a French assignment beyond them, but Leicester strode onto the turf as if their winning ways had permeated to even the support staff. Top of the Top 14 they may be, but Bordeaux were all fingers and thumbs for most of the first half, perhaps disorientated by opposition playing in this inferno with as much confidence as Leicester. They may have seen fit to rest a host of key players – no Freddie Steward, Nemani Nadolo, Ben Youngs, Julian Montoya and Hanro Liebenberg, to name just a few – but they swung their hosts this way and that. Ford, fresh from the announcement of his imminent departure for Sale, continues to look a million dollars at his level, now that his international career is seemingly on hold. He exchanged penalties with Maxime Lucu in the first quarter, before springing Bryce Hegarty through the Bordeaux defence with a typically sublime delayed pass. Guy Porter was on hand to finish. Leicester were well worth the lead they held to the brink of half-time, but they had scored their try with Bordeaux down to 14, following Kane Douglas’s yellow card for the latest failure to avoid the unavoidable, his arm making contact with the head of the dipping Ollie Chessum. Bordeaux replied with a try on the stroke of half-time, when Leicester were down to 14. A rare tactical error saw Leicester kick penalties to the corner twice. After the second lineout, Ford put in a cross-kick, which resulted in a yellow for the chasing Hosea Saumaki. Bordeaux capitalised a few minutes later. From a second attacking scrum, with Ford covering the blindside in the absence of Saumaki, Bordeaux worked Jean-Baptiste Dubie through to the posts from a simple midfield move. Leicester will be sick to have turned round level. Perhaps it niggled at them, because on the resumption it was they who started to make the mistakes – and Ford suddenly as many as anybody, missing a straightforward penalty a few minutes in. Lucu punished it by landing one to take Bordeaux clear four minutes later. It was a soft penalty, but there was no doubt that it came amid a fresh onslaught from the home side. Lucu had another chance on the hour, after Callum Green came through an advancing Bordeaux maul. This time, he missed, albeit from some distance on the angle. The turning point came deep into the final quarter. Ford kicked long, where replacement Ulupano Seuteni, playing out of position at fly-half, fumbled under no pressure. At the scrum, Thierry Paiva bored across, allowing Ford to redeem himself by drawing Leicester level. The game was poised now, Leicester having weathered the storm of the third quarter. A routine carry by Ellis Genge coaxed a penalty from Douglas, and Ford stepped up from more than 40 metres out to land the winning penalty. Bordeaux had one final tilt at the death. Lucu chose to kick a late penalty to the corner, but Louis Picamoles was adjudged to have gone off his feet as Bordeaux picked and drove. Leicester’s winning run continues.",Sport/Sport,Ford on target as Leicester stun Bordeaux to extend winning streak,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/bordeaux-begles-leicester-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
