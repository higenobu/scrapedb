4/26/2022,"The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has travelled to Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin in an attempt to put the UN at the heart of Ukrainian mediation efforts. Guterres has faced criticism from Ukraine for not visiting Kyiv first and for failing to intervene decisively before Russia invaded on 24 February. He is also scheduled to meet the Russian foreign minster, Sergei Lavrov, before travelling to Ukraine. “It is simply wrong to go first to Russia and then to Ukraine,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday. “There is no justice and no logic in this order. The war is in Ukraine, there are no bodies in the streets of Moscow. It would be logical to go first to Ukraine, to see the people there, the consequences of the occupation”. Some of Zelenskiy’s advisers have said Guterres has no mandate to talk to Russia on their behalf. The timing of the visit seems unpropitious, since both sides are heavily committed to the battle in the two big eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, known collectively as the Donbas, and the Ukrainian army is receiving its greatest supply of heavy armoury from the US than at any point in the fighting. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said after meeting Zelenskiy on Monday: “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kind of things it has done in invading Ukraine.” Lavrov for his part has claimed Nato has become a legitimate target due to the supply of this weaponry. More than half – $1.9bn – of US military aid to Ukraine since the war has come in the last two weeks. More than 60% of US military aid to Ukraine since the war has come in over the last month: $2.3bn. The best hope for the Guterres mission is to make progress on ceasefires to help civilians leave trapped cities, and to start to lay the groundwork for how Ukraine’s neutrality could be protected by the major powers once the fighting has ended. Guterres announced his mediation effort after more than 200 former United Nations officials sent him a letter urging him to try to intervene and warning the UN was being marginalised in the crisis to the point of extinction. One of the signatories of the letter, Franz Baumann, a UN assistant secretary general until 2015, told the Guardian that previous secretary generals understood they had a role independent of the security council to protect the UN charter, adding the letter had been written by UN patriots because the honour of the UN needed defending. He said before the war started, the secretary general should have gone to Moscow to demand Putin say if he was sincere when he said the troop movements on Russia’s border of Ukraine did not represent a threat to the integrity of Ukraine, and “if he did not get a satisfactory answer he should have gone to Beijing to the Winter Olympic ceremonies to ask the same question of Russia and China when they met. “Then he should have gone to the capitals that have been hedging such as Pretoria, Brasilia, New Delhi and Ankara to demand they support peace. He added the duty of the secretary General under article 99 of the charter was to bring to the attention of the security council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. “Simply deploring something is not enough,” he said. “He does not seem to have grasped the concept that it is his responsibility to speak on behalf of the charter”. Baumann recalled Kofi Annan’s visit to Baghdad before the Gulf war in 1998 and Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s visit to Sarajevo during the Bosnian war in 1993. Andrew Gilmour, another signatory to the letter and a former UN assistant secretary general for human rights until 2019, said: “It is very important for the long-term credibility of the UN that the SG is now visiting. From what I’m hearing, there are thousands of UN staff – current and past – who in recent weeks have been very anxious for Guterres to go to the affected countries. Yes, there isn’t a big chance that Guterres will pull something off, and it certainly wouldn’t be his fault if doesn’t. “Not being afraid to fail is a crucial leadership attribute for a UNSG – because after all, what’s one person’s self-esteem when one’s talking about averting the horrors of war? “There are millions of people around the world who hope Guterres will really speak truth to power in Moscow and make a passionate but calculated appeal in a way nobody else can do with Putin, and which would be very much of the SG’s job description anyway.” ",News/World news,United Nations chief heads to Moscow amid criticism from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/un-guterres-putin-meeting-moscow-ukraine-war
4/26/2022,"Was Walter Sickert the Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper? This grimily realist painter has been fingered for the Whitechapel murders by Ripperologists including Patricia Cornwell. But I didn’t expect to find damning evidence in a serious survey of his work at Tate Britain. Not that they flaunt it. But when I got to the last essay in the handsome catalogue my jaw dropped. In 1888, this actor and artist – who was born in Munich in 1860 and moved to Britain as a child – appears to have written a series of letters to the police, claiming to be the killer. He put his drawing skills to macabre use in these missives, drawing caricatures of brutal male faces, sketches of men with knives standing over women’s bodies. It doesn’t mean he actually was the serial killer, says the startling essay by Anna Gruetzner Robins. There were a lot of such letters. But the letters with arty touches – including the use of a draughtman’s pen, even a woodcut – do really seem to be by Sickert. In 2002 Tate’s conservation department got the respected paper analyst Peter Bower to compare Sickert’s correspondence with some of the Ripper letters. His research “has conclusively shown that the paper of three letters written by Sickert in 1890 matches two Jack the Ripper letters of October 1888”. Are you sitting comfortably? You won’t be. There is solid evidence that even if Sickert was not the killer, he may have believed or fantasised that he was. He even did a painting of his own flat and called it Jack the Ripper’s Bedroom, recently shown at the Walker Art Gallery’s Sickert show. And the centre of this exhibition is a no-holds-barred display of Sickert’s nudes. Against the dark walls of the gallery, in fierce yet subtle lighting, the women are laid out. Their bodies are spread, exhibited, arranged, “like a patient etherised upon a table”, to quote TS Eliot. One model lies with her legs hanging over the bed, her arms spread out. She could be the dead Christ. Another is washing, but as she bends in a doorway we can’t see her head, only her naked body. L’Affaire de Camden Town takes it to another level. In this 1909 painting, a man stands over an inert female form on a bed. But it is worse than that. She is not so much a continuous figure as a collection of ruddy, moist forms like meat in a butcher’s window. The male onlooker could be a killer contemplating his handiwork – which is exactly what Sickert’s title implies. For this is one of a series of paintings that allude to the murder of Emily Elizabeth Dimmock in Camden, London, in 1907. Sickert became fascinated by this murder. If he really is responsible for sketches of a man with a knife over a woman’s body in the Ripper letters of 1888, his Camden Town Murder paintings eerily echo them. In The Camden Town Murder, or What Shall We Do for the Rent?, the man sits in despair while the nude on the iron bed has her face turned from us. She may be crying or he may have just throttled her. The stiffness of her arm and awkwardly placed hand suggests the latter. In a drawing called Persuasion a bald, bearded man appears to strangle a woman before our eyes. These are truly shocking images, more than a century on. Yet they have affinities with some of the greatest modern art, as the exhibition demonstrates. Sickert was strongly influenced by Degas, and in turn influenced Lucian Freud – there are nudes here by both for comparison. The most appalling aspects of Sickert’s nudes are also their artistic strength. He rejects the phoney academic nude for raw naked reality – he even wrote an essay explaining this aesthetic. This is why he depicts women, more literally perhaps than any artist, as objects: because the body is an object, it is meat. Francis Bacon would agree with him. Unless this is the art of a stone cold psychopath. Whoever he really was, Sickert liked to keep people guessing. A room of self-portraits takes in his ever-changing poses, sometimes a bluff comedian, at others a haunted man. In a 1930s self-portrait, he copies a photograph of himself looking like a clapped-out music hall entertainer tapping the ground with a stick as he shuffles down the street. Am I that clown? He asks. The most violent and frightening images are in Sickert’s paintings of music halls. These canvases preserve a lost form of popular entertainment, portraying its stars and architecture, audiences and atmosphere – but you can hardly call them celebratory. In one of the earliest, Bonnet et Claque: Ada Lundberg at the Marylebone Music Hall, painted in about 1887, a singer opens her mouth in full-throated chanson. But she is crowded by some of the most horrible faces imaginable. One bowler-hatted young man has empty black eyes and a mouth hanging idiotically, bestially, open. The scariest has ghoulish, bloodshot eyes, a nose that has collapsed into a skull-like orifice, and a slash of a grinning mouth that seems to have been cut into his flesh with a razor. If I was going to investigate Sickert’s sick mind I would start here – what is this carnival of death? Perhaps it is about syphilis. Sickert was not the only fin de siecle artist obsessed with this disease. I may seem to be judging Sickert. In reality, he seems to have pronounced a cruel judgment on himself. If he did fantasise he was Jack the Ripper and the Camden Town Murderer, that suggests he was consumed with guilt. He was a man of his time, confused about sex, confused about women. In his music hall paintings all the men are monsters. But the women on stage alone, caught in the spooky light, ogled by brutes, are vulnerable and he wants to protect them. Maybe it was the male throat he wanted to slash – and his own image that he monsters. In a late self-portrait as a modern Lazarus, after he has been ill, he has obliterated his features with a splash of grey paint. This hellishly brilliant exhibition takes you to a place beyond simple moral or political truth. Whatever Sickert was, he was the only British artist of his time who can be as powerful as Munch, Van Gogh or Otto Dix. In the end, a young man who thought he was Jack the Ripper is someone you have to feel sorry for. Unless he was, of course.

4/26/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith’s former patrol commander has denied in court accusations he ordered the execution of an elderly Afghan prisoner discovered hiding in a tunnel – in an alleged “blooding” of a junior soldier. The retired soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 5, was directly challenged on Tuesday by lawyers for three newspapers being sued by Roberts-Smith: “You told [soldier] Person 4 to murder the old man.” “That isn’t true,” Person 5 replied. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges were defamatory and portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The cross-examination of Person 5 has concentrated on an Australian SAS raid on a compound known as Whiskey 108 – in the Taliban redoubt of Kakarak village in Uruzgan province – on 12 April 2009, with a particular focus on apparent inconsistencies that have emerged in evidence. It is not contested two men were killed during that raid: a disabled man with a prosthetic leg and an elderly man. But irreconcilable versions of events have emerged about how they were killed. The newspapers allege the two men were discovered hiding in a small tunnel inside the compound, where ordnance was also found. The men were brought from the tunnel and taken into custody before, the newspapers allege, Person 5 ordered a junior soldier, Person 4, to execute the elderly man, a command obeyed with the acquiescence of Roberts-Smith. Person 4 was a new soldier to the regiment and was allegedly being “blooded” – ordered to make his first kill on the battlefield. The newspapers say the man with the prosthetic leg was murdered by Roberts-Smith, who, it has been claimed, “frog-marched” the man outside the compound and threw him to the ground before machine-gunning him to death. The court has heard from a number of Australian soldiers on the raid that day, who were subpoenaed by the newspapers and have testified they saw men pulled from the tunnel. Others say they witnessed the disabled man’s execution. The killing of the man with a prosthetic leg has become a key allegation – the man’s leg was souvenired by another soldier and taken back to the SAS’s unofficial bar on base, the Fat Ladies Arms, where it was used as a macabre war trophy and drinking vessel. Both Person 5 and Roberts-Smith have consistently told the court there were no people discovered in the tunnel and that the claims the men were unlawfully killed were false. Roberts-Smith said he shot and killed the man with the prosthetic when he saw him running – armed and posing a potential threat to Australian soldiers. He said the man was an insurgent and a legitimate target killed within the laws of war. In his evidence, Roberts-Smith said the elderly man, also an insurgent, was shot by another Australian soldier whose identity he, to this day, does not know. He credits the soldier with saving his life. However, Person 5 told the court Person 4 shot the elderly man in a legitimate engagement, and that this was known to the Australian soldiers because it was discussed at a troop debrief after the mission. In a tense exchange with Nicholas Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, Person 5 defended his evidence before the court and his actions at Whiskey 108. “You saw the man who came out of the tunnel as the perfect opportunity to ‘blood’ Person 4,” the barrister said on Tuesday. “No, I disagree with that,” Person 5 replied. “I want to put to you that you had assessed that the two men that came out of the tunnel were insurgents … and you thought, didn’t you, that you couldn’t trust the Afghan judicial system to keep these two men off the battlefield?” Owens said. “No, I don’t agree with that,” the ex-soldier said. “It frustrated you, didn’t it, that people would be taken back to [the Australian base at] Tarin Kowt and then shortly afterwards would be found out on the battlefield?” Owns said. “No, it’s an accepted part of the game. We knew that the judicial system was corrupt and they’d be back,” Person 5 said. “I then want to put to you that when you told Person 4 to kill the old man, Mr Roberts-Smith didn’t say or do anything to disagree with your order, correct?” “I don’t agree with that,” was the reply. “Just to be very clear, what I want to put to you is that the old man was a PUC [person under control] who was found in the tunnel,” Owens said. “No, I don’t agree with that,” Person 5 said. Person 5’s cross-examination focused on photographs of the two men’s bodies, in particular where the bodies lay and whether they had been moved after being shot. Owens put it to Person 5 the men were photographed where they were killed and that the photographs of their corpses did not show evidence of them having been moved. Roberts-Smith and Person 5 have both told the court the bodies were moved back to a safer space, behind cover, to perform so-called sensitive site exploitation on the bodies – essentially checking them for weapons, communication devices, identification cards or any other material that could yield useful information. Both Person 5 and Roberts-Smith claim to have removed the prosthetic leg from the slain man. At the time he was killed, it was believed he might have been Objective Xiphos, a Taliban operative known to conceal bomb-making materials in his prosthetic leg. The man killed was not Objective Xiphos. Roberts-Smith has told the court previously: “I removed the prosthetic leg when we were doing SSE”. He said he did not re-attach it to the man’s body, but left it, “somewhere near the body – on the body, next to the body, back in place”. However, Person 5 told the court on Tuesday he took the leg off the body and checked it for explosives. Cross-examined about the prosthetic, Person 5 told the court: “I know that I took the leg off – that’s a fact.” The trial, before justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial: former patrol commander denies ordering execution of elderly prisoner,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/ben-roberts-smith-defamation-trial-former-patrol-commander-denies-ordering-execution-of-elderly-prisoner
4/26/2022,"A Sydney mayor was “provided benefits”, including a series of overseas trips, by property developers in return for decisions that favoured their interests, the Independent Commission Against Corruption has heard. On Tuesday Icac opened its public hearings into the alleged conduct of Canada Bay mayor and former federal and state Labor party candidate Angelo Tsirekas. The hearings are part of an investigation into whether Tsirekas accepted developer-funded trips overseas to Shanghai and Lebanon as an “inducement or reward” for approvals of a high-rise development in the inner-west suburb of Rhodes. Counsel assisting the inquiry, Jamie Darams, opened the public hearing by saying the ongoing investigation relates to a series of “interconnected” relationships between Tsirekas and property developers, consultants, planners and an accountant. Tuesday’s evidence centred on one of those developers, I-Prosperity Group, which is now in liquidation. The inquiry heard two of its directors, Michael Gu and Harry Huang, were both in hiding after fleeing Australia in wake of accusations of misappropriating investors’ money. Darams said Icac was investigating whether Tsirekas sought or accepted benefits from I-Prosperity Group as “inducement or reward for partially and dishonestly exercising his official functions” in relation to the Rhodes high-rise. He outlined a series of overseas trips taken by Tsirekas and Joseph Chidiac, a friend of the mayor’s since 2010 and a contractor paid about $1.4m by I-Prosperity, to Shanghai, Lebanon and the United States between October 2015 and June 2019. Darams told the inquiry that Icac would hear evidence showing that I-Prosperity paid for Tsirekas’s accommodation during a trip to Shanghai in January 2016, during which he was a guest at Huang’s wedding. “To be clear, from November 2015 and June 2019, the evidence is expected to show Mr Tsirekas went overseas on 24 occasions and that on many of these occasions this was in the company of Mr Chidiac,” Darams said. Darams told the inquiry that Tsirekas has not declared any potential conflicts from his relationships with Gu, Huang between Chidiac 2015 and 2019. Tsirekas, who has taken a period of leave as mayor, has previously said he will defend himself against the allegations. The inquiry heard evidence from Belinda Li, a Chinese national who helped to finance the high-rise proposal in Rhodes, who said she remembered being in Shanghai for Huang’s wedding with Tsirekas and Joseph Chidiac. Li, who told the inquiry she lost about $5m after the collapse of I-Prosperity, had been closely involved in the day-to-day planning associated with the Rhodes development. She remembered both Tsirekas and Chidiac being in Shanghai in January 2016 for the wedding, and taking them sightseeing. “I remember taking them to have a play around in Shanghai [to] try some street food [and] local traditional locations,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While Tuesday’s evidence centred around I-Prosperity and its now defunct high-rise plans in Rhodes, the Icac inquiry, which spans a period dating back a decade to 2012, will also look into Tsirekas’s dealings with developers Billbergia and Prolet, as well as a series of allegedly favourable decisions made for friends and associates of the mayor. Run by Irish brothers John and William Kinsella, development firm Billbergia has amassed significant development holdings within Rhodes between 2008 and 2019, as has Prolet, run by another pair of brothers, Joseph and Pierre Jacob. Darams told Icac that between 2012 and 2016, Tsirekas voted in favour of resolutions linked to the two companies without making declarations about his relationship with either of them. Darams said the inquiry would hear evidence that since 2012 Tsirekas had “attended dinners, lunches and other functions” with one of the Kinsella brothers, and that he had been friends with Joseph Jacob for about a decade. He said the inquiry would also hear evidence that Chidiac was also engaged to provide services for Billbergia and was paid about $550,000 by the company between 2015 and 2018. He also received “substantial reward” as a result of work done for Prolet, Darams said. “The public inquiry will investigate whether Mr Tsirekas deliberately failed to declare or disclose his relationships with Billbergia, Prolet and Mr Chidiac and the reasons why he did that,” he said. The wide-ranging inquiry is also investigating whether Canada Bay council’s former general manager, Gary Sawyer, “partially and dishonestly exercised his official functions and failed to disclose the nature of his relationship” with developers.",News/Australia news,"NSW mayor was ‘provided benefits’ by property developers, Icac hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/nsw-mayor-was-provided-benefits-by-property-developers-icac-hears

4/26/2022,"The impact of Sydney’s road tolls on spiralling cost of living pressures will be examined as part of a New South Wales government review into the city’s patchwork network, dubbed “tollmania” by the opposition. A NSW Treasury document said that inconsistencies within the vast system had led to motorist confusion and the road network not functioning optimally. The government document also stated that tolling arrangements had been put in place inconsistently as new roads had been built, which would be a key focus for the review due to report back in September. “The evolution of tolling arrangements in NSW has largely been on a case-by-case basis as new toll roads have been commissioned,” said the document, released in response to a question on notice. “The current arrangements do not reflect a system-wide approach and incorporate many different charging mechanisms.” The review will be led by officials from Treasury and Transport for NSW, and will provide advice on how the government can improve the systems taking into consideration state coffers, emissions reduction targets and affordability. The metropolitan roads minister, Natalie Ward, said the government was committed to finding “innovative” ways to keep down costs and would not rule out any measure before experts made their recommendations. “We are a government that is mindful of cost of living pressures on our community … that’s why we have implemented the toll review,” she said on Tuesday. “We’re always mindful of ways in which we can be innovative and look at every opportunity to do so. “All options are available so that they can tell us what they think might be the best way for us to improve the equity and efficiency.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ward would not be drawn on what the government was planning to do about the Sydney Harbour Tunnel tolls when the existing arrangements expire in four months.

4/26/2022,"If you’ve been paying attention over the past decade or so, you may have noticed that opponents of climate action in Australia spend a lot of time talking about things that don’t exist. Tony Abbott pioneered this technique by winning an election promising to repeal a carbon tax that never actually existed. Abbott’s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, is leading the authority on this point. Over to you, Peta. “It wasn’t a carbon tax, as you know. It was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax,” Credlin said in February 2017. “We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment. That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and, when he cut through, Gillard was gone.” For the record, Labor’s policy was a carbon price, not a tax. There’s a difference. Abbott and Credlin flipping carbon pricing into a tax (abetted by the then Labor government that rolled over too easily on the nomenclature) was the core of the weaponisation of climate policy that continues to this day. So every time one of the current generation of Coalition politicians utters the words carbon “tax” and Labor in the same sentence, understand this: they are lying, and worse, they are fully aware they are lying. You’d think, with Australia’s lived experience of global heating – catastrophic fires and floods – we’d have moved past grown men staging hyperbolic encounters with invisible things, but during a 30-minute monologue that was heavy on the harangue and light on coherence, 2GB’s chief ranter, Ray Hadley, was back to a carbon tax. Hadley had Anthony Albanese on the line. The Labor leader has Covid. But that didn’t deter Ray from using the Labor leader as a performative pinata. Hadley clearly imagined himself setting up a campaign masterstroke. He asked Albanese whether he would repeat Julia Gillard’s now infamous pledge that there would be no carbon tax under the government he led. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese shouldn’t have taken dictation from a shock jock. Given the whole encounter was entirely about Ray, boosting Ray, to Ray’s audience (and to whomever else might be interested … perhaps a prime minister Ray once asked to swear on a Bible, an impertinence that sent him to Coventry for quite some time) – the Labor leader should have told Hadley exactly where he could shove his dictation. Stupid to gratify him. But in any case, this was an easy enough pledge to make given Labor has, 1: never implemented a carbon tax; and 2: has no intention of implementing one now. Albanese uttered the words dutifully. We will have no carbon tax, ever, the Labor leader said. Thank God we cleared that one up. As well as grinding away on the great nothingness that is the never-implemented carbon tax that will never be implemented, Scott Morrison and friends are now working up a new big scare for 2022. You’ll be shocked, I know. This one involves a new carbon tax. Confusingly, this new Labor carbon tax was actually legislated many years ago by Abbott. The new fake fight is about the safeguards mechanism which was implemented by Abbott after he repealed the carbon tax that wasn’t a tax. For the record: the purpose of Abbott’s safeguards mechanism was to cut pollution from heavy emitters. The then climate minister, Greg Hunt, always wanted to tighten the scheme, ensuring it delivered on its intended purpose, but that didn’t happen. Labor says it will use the government’s safeguard mechanism (wait for it, hope you are sitting down, smelling salts at the ready) for its intended purpose. The 215 companies currently covered by the safeguards mechanism will have to develop plans to either reduce or offset their emissions in line with reaching net zero emissions by 2050. For the record, both sides have exactly the same mid-century target and they are proposing exactly the same mechanism to reach it. The only difference comes with the trajectory – Labor has a higher target for 2030, which means these companies will either have to abate or offset their emissions more quickly. And again, for the record, Labor’s use of the Coalition’s safeguards mechanism to achieve its intended purpose contains a further safeguard. The current policy says big polluters, like oil, gas and coal operations, will not face more stringent emissions reduction requirements in Australia than their competitors do overseas, which is why every big business group in the country has welcomed Labor’s policy. But Morrison now disdains his own safeguards mechanism as “their” (meaning Labor’s) “safeguards mechanism, which is, effectively their carbon tax”. Morrison could say Labor’s safeguards mechanism is effectively an elephant and the observation would be about as accurate. Perhaps he should try that? Mix it up a bit. Given words don’t have meaning. Axe the elephant. That elephant will wipe out Whyalla. Why not? After branding his own policy a carbon tax, Morrison then falls back on his tried and true formulation. The Coalition will achieve net zero through technology, not taxes. What the prime minister fails to mention when he skips through that talking point is you, the voters, pay for that technology through your taxes. Let me repeat: you are paying. While much of the media has stampeded in the direction of the invisible elephant, demanding to know what Labor is hiding in a policy that has been in the public domain for months, one of the Coalition’s candidates, Colin Boyce, stood up in plain sight this week and pointed squarely at the elephant in the room. Boyce, a National from central Queensland, told the ABC on Monday Morrison’s net zero commitment was a crock because it was just words. This is verifiably true in the way Boyce said it. He said Morrison’s net zero “statement” was a flexible, non-binding plan that wouldn’t be legislated, and left plenty of “wiggle room”. But there are two problems with Boyce’s truth-telling. 1: That’s not what Liberal candidates are saying in North Sydney, Wentworth, or Goldstein; and 2: it’s not what Morrison told the United Nations last year so that old mate BoJo would stop nagging him about saving the planet. When the prime minister was called on this inconvenience on Tuesday, Morrison pretended Boyce didn’t say the 2050 commitment was a crock. “Our candidate was talking about how we get there,” Morrison said. “He wasn’t talking about the commitment itself”. Actually, Boyce was talking about both those things. Using comprehensible words with readily understood meanings. Not a blizzard of talking points constructed on half truths and outright lies. So what this all boils down to is the Coalition is pretending it has a strategy to bring down emissions in the city while Nationals disavow that same strategy in the regions, even though the Nationals signed up to the 2050 strategy in return for billions in infrastructure projects they are now flogging during this election campaign. The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, now declares he doesn’t like the word transition after signing up to a transition by signing up to a net zero target – unless Boyce is right of course, and the Nationals have signed up to nothing at all, in which case somebody better tell Dave Sharma and Trent Zimmerman and BoJo and the United Nations. This excruciating abrogation of the national interest at taxpayer expense is accompanied by Morrison attacking Labor for harbouring secret carbon taxes to accomplish what are, on paper, near-identical policy goals to be pursued by the same mechanisms – a cynical bit of political brinkmanship, amplified fecklessly by boofheads like Hadley who are content as long as their ego is gratified and the outrage cycle is fed. Presumably somebody else, at some future time, can clean up the mess. Seriously, how much more of this can Australians take?

4/26/2022,"Emma Raducanu has split with her coach, Torben Beltz, after working together for only five months. Citing the need to begin a “new training model”, Raducanu will once again be searching for a new coach. “I want to thank Torben for his coaching, professionalism and dedication over the last half a year,” said Raducanu in a statement. “He has a huge heart and I have enjoyed our strong chemistry during the time together.” Raducanu is in Spain for the Madrid Open, a WTA 1000 tournament, which begins with the women’s main draw on Thursday. She is accompanied in Spain by Iain Bates, the LTA’s head of women’s tennis. “I feel the best direction for my development is to transition to a new training model with the LTA supporting in the interim,” she said. The split means that Raducanu is now searching for a fourth coach in the past year, an unusually fast turnover even in tennis’s volatile coaching carousel. Raducanu had worked with the prominent British coach Nigel Sears during her surprise run to the Wimbledon fourth round before hiring Andrew Richardson to support her on her first prolonged trip abroad in the United States last summer. Following her decision not to continue working with Richardson, who had helped her to the US Open title in September, Raducanu hired Beltz after a series of trials with different coaches at the end of last year. As she joined up with Beltz, Raducanu had cited the need to work with a more experienced coach who could help guide her in her unexpected jump up to the rigours of the Tour and Beltz, who moulded Angelique Kerber into a No 1 player from her teenage years, was a well-regarded candidate known for his positive outlook. However, his experience appears to have had limited effect on her in their short time together. Raducanu’s 2022 season so far has instead been defined by the difficulty of following up such a life-changing victory in New York and her inexperience that has been reflected in her performances and the various injuries she has picked up as her body grows accustomed to life in professional tennis. She compiled a 5-7 record with Beltz this season. Still, the past few weeks had clearly taken a positive turn, with Raducanu following up her first professional win on clay and on her Billie Jean King Cup debut in Prague by reaching the quarter-final of the Porsche Grand Prix in Stuttgart. In the quarter-final against the new world No 1, Iga Swiatek, she went down to a respectable 4-6, 4-6 defeat. Raducanu notably prepared for her first clay-court season by training for a few days at the renowned Piatti academy in Italy, home of Ricardo Piatti, the former coach of Maria Sharapova who is without a top student after a recent split with Jannik Sinner. Raducanu played down the significance of her time there during the Billie Jean King Cup, saying she had merely been using their facilities to prepare on clay while Beltz was on holiday with his family.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu searching for fourth coach after split with Torben Beltz,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/emma-raducanu-searching-for-fourth-coach-after-split-with-torben-beltz-tennis
4/26/2022,"Britain’s gradual emergence from the Covid-19 pandemic meant government borrowing more than halved in the latest financial year but remained the third highest on record, the latest official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said the gap between the state’s revenues and its spending stood at £151.8bn in the 12 months to March, down from £317.6bn in the previous year. Despite the improvement over the year as a whole, the total deficit for 2021-22 was more than £20bn higher than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted when preparing estimates for Rishi’s Sunak’s spring statement last month. The chancellor said the economy was recovering and the public finances improving but said previous borrowing had left a legacy of debt. “Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which mean we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt,” Sunak said. Borrowing in March alone was £18.1bn – lower than had been predicted by the City – but still the second highest since modern records began in 1947. According to the ONS, the national debt – the accumulation of borrowing over time – stood at £2.3tn at the end of last month, just over 96% of the economy’s annual output. Interest payments on the debt rose to a record of just under £70bn. Bethany Beckett, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said there was likely to be a further fall in the deficit to around £100bn in 2022-23 even though the economy was now slowing. As a result, the chancellor would have scope to use his autumn budget to respond to the cost of living crisis. Michal Stelmach, a senior economist at KPMG UK, said: “The outlook for borrowing naturally looks better in comparison to the pressures that pushed it up during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the last financial year alone, the government’s coronavirus job retention and the self-employment income support schemes together cost the taxpayer £17bn, while NHS test and trace added a further £16bn. These schemes have now been phased out.”",News/Business,UK government borrowing halves but is still close to record high,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/uk-government-borrowing-deficit-ons
4/26/2022,"Profits at HSBC tumbled nearly 30% in the first quarter due to fears of a surge in defaults linked to inflation and the “devastating consequences” of the war in Ukraine. The London-headquartered bank said profits fell to $4.2bn (£3.3bn) from $5.8bn a year ago, as it put aside $642m to cover potential defaults on loans in the first three months of the year. Banks have started to put aside more money to cover losses from unpaid loans, amid fears that customers will fall behind on payments due to the cost of living crisis that has been exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has disrupted energy flows and global supply chains. It marks a reversal from 2021, when banks were able to release money put aside for defaults linked to the Covid crisis, thanks to government support programmes that kept workers and companies afloat. “The Russia-Ukraine war continues to have devastating consequences both within Ukraine and beyond”, the HSBC chief executive, Noel Quinn said, with the bank adding that it was “monitoring developments closely”. However, the lender has so far kept its operations open in Russia, despite pressure from MPs and the decision by rivals including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs to close their offices last month. HSBC, which has about 200 staff in the country, defended its position, saying it was not accepting new business or customers there. “The vast majority of our business in Russia serves multinational corporate clients headquartered in other countries, and as a global bank, HSBC has a responsibility to help them manage these challenging circumstances,” the bank said. Profits in the first quarter were also affected by lower revenues from its wealth business caused by the strict Covid lockdown policy in Hong Kong, as well as a drop in investment banking fees. Big banks including HSBC are grappling with the end of the 2021 investment banking boom, as fewer companies raise money on the financial markets and hold back from mergers and takeovers. However, the bank benefited from a continued surge in home buying that started during the pandemic, as well as the subsequent jump in house prices. Mortgage lending grew by $5.8bn in the first quarter, accounting for more than half of the $9bn in customer loan growth at the start of the year.
