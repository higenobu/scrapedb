4/9/2022,"“There were one or two more smiles than normal in training,” Thomas Frank said this week in the afterglow of Brentford’s stunning 4-1 win at Chelsea last Saturday, and quite right too. So, how do they follow that up? Well, another London derby looms on Sunday. They could be playing West Ham at the perfect time, after the Hammers’ tough Europa League game on Thursday, with the second leg next week. But Brentford look safe so the visitors may see this as a good chance to revive their top-four aspirations.

A chest-thumpingly heartening comeback victory, complete with late winner, against fellow relegation-threatened Everton in midweek could be the spark that lights Sean Dyche’s rocket ship to safety. To keep his side’s trajectory stable, this has the feel of an absolute must-win, both to keep momentum going and to heap further pressure on Frank Lampard’s side. For Norwich, winless in all competitions since 5 February and with only two points from the last 24 available, 30 points remains a miserably distant target with eight games remaining, never mind the 40 traditionally viewed as sufficient for survival.

4/9/2022,"Air raid sirens were near constant and Russian troops were on the outskirts of the city, but that didn’t stop some people in Kyiv from dancing. A group of Ukrainian tango dancers wrapped up warm against the freezing weather and met up in the botanic gardens, swirling around each other to the strains of an Argentinian milonga. They embraced and laughed with relief to see those around them were still alive and a video of the event posted to social media delighted people across the country struggling with their bleak new reality. “We didn’t plan to dance, it just happened,” said Valentina Belyaeva, an active member of Kyiv’s latin dance scene. “The soldiers around were a bit wary at first but they let us keep going. We were just so happy to see everyone alive and well.” A vicious war is still raging. As the Kremlin’s ground forces have pulled back from towns and villages surrounding the capital to refocus on the east of the country, horrifying evidence of war crimes against civilians is coming to light. Yet signs of life were trickling back into the capital this week: every day brought more people on the streets, more cars on the roads, and more businesses and cafes opening their doors. On Saturday, Belyaeva is looking forward to hosting the first milonga since the conflict broke out at Art Prychal, a dance hall on the banks of the Dneiper, the vast river that runs through the heart of Kyiv. “In summer we are out here dancing until 5am. It’s a beautiful spot,” Belyaeva said. “But we are going to dance regardless, war or no war.” While Paris and Istanbul are known as the tango capitals of Europe, Kyiv boasts a surprisingly large and vibrant latin dance community for a city home to 3 million people. In more normal times, about 400 regulars show up for different milonga evenings each week. The city hosted its first international milonga festival last October, which attracted visitors from all over the world, and Belyaeva and her husband are still planning to go ahead with another event planned for May. Milonga is a faster, more relaxed and sociable form of traditional Argentinian tango, in which dancers swap partners after every tonda, or turn. It involves a tighter embrace of your partner, and quicker dance steps that echo the more staccato rhythms of the lively, almost waltz-like music. Belyaeva fell in love with it 15 years ago, when looking to try out new things after a divorce. She met her second husband through dancing. “There’s a saying in tango,” she said, while walking arm in arm with him along the Dniper. “Tango brings children.” For Sergio Omelyanenko, tango has been his whole life. Before the pandemic, and before the war, he was dancing professionally as well as giving two or three lessons a day either at a dance school or privately. To his surprise, many clients got in touch even after Russia invaded in February, still keen to learn. “I guess people need to do something with their bodies and occupy their brains, instead of 24/7 reading the news and worrying,” he said in an interview at his teaching studio in Pechersk in central Kyiv. “The studio is a basement studio and it has two entrances. It’s 5km from home, so we can get here even if there’s no public transport. So I figured, why not?” Dancing is an opportunity for people to connect with and explore their emotions, the 23-year-old said. “I think the stereotype is that tango is just about romantic love, but really, it’s about having a conversation with your partner. It’s very social,” he said. “You share what you feel, it’s very emotional. Hunger, pain, suffering, you find it in tango.” Omelyanenko estimates around half of his friends and clients have left the city, but what remains of Kyiv’s tango community is looking forward to Saturday night’s event. For many who decided not to flee the Russian advance, staying, and living life to its fullest, are acts of resistance in themselves. “I have friends in Russia, my wife is from Belarus. In those places, you can’t speak freely, you’ll go to prison. Ukraine fought for freedom in 2014 [in the popular uprising that brought down the country’s pro-Russian government]. “Ukrainians know freedom is the most important feeling. Staying, dancing, enjoying life, is about protecting that.”",News/World news,Kyiv’s tango partners refuse to let war slow passion for dancing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/kyivs-tango-partners-refuse-to-let-war-slow-passion-for-dancing
4/9/2022,"The physical ticket – to a gig or a play or a comedy show or a sporting event – is a vanishing entity. It has been, or at least is being, replaced by the e-ticket conveniently mailed to your inbox (a state of affairs that curiously doesn’t seem to have negated the need for a handling charge), or the QR code, swiftly scanned on your phone. It probably won’t be long before it vanishes entirely, consigned to the dustbin of history with all the other pop cultural ephemera we no longer need: mountains of DVDs; fanclubs that furnished us with badges and posters by mail; the lost art of taping songs off the radio. There are plenty of reasons why technology uncoupling us from physical objects is a good thing, environmental impact and convenience among them. You are less likely to lose your phone than a small piece of paper. Your e-ticket is not going to get lost in the post. But it also isn’t going to last. You are unlikely to find yourself gazing misty-eyed at a QR code in years to come, magically transported back to the night in question. Something will be lost when physical tickets vanish, at least for the people who kept them as reminders: a small, flimsy portal into the pleasurable past. A ticket doesn’t even have to stay intact to exude a nostalgic pull. I was 18 and My Bloody Valentine were my favourite band: I loved their songs, the physical effect of the volume they performed at live and the sense that they were doing something groundbreaking. I carelessly put the ticket (pictured above) in my back pocket, where heat caused it to disintegrate over the course of the show. I thought it was a disaster, but I look at what’s left of it now and I’m transported not to the show itself, but the aftermath of dozens of teenage gigs: the feeling of my soaked clothes cooling and clinging; the smell of leather jackets that reeked of stale sweat, spilled beer and cigarette smoke; the exhilarated conversations muffled by the fact we were all temporarily half-deaf. Alexis Petridis Mimi Weinberg – the Beatles at Shea Stadium I saw the Beatles at Shea Stadium in New York in 1965. My dear aunt Doris got tickets for my cousin and a few friends to celebrate my cousin’s birthday. We got there early, and as we walked around outside Shea, girls would scream every time a helicopter flew overhead, sure that the Beatles were in it. One girl fainted each time. I attempted to get down nearer to the dugout – we had spotted Paul – but no luck. Once they began playing, it was screaming, screaming, screaming the entire set. I did not hear the music until the documentary film was released a few years ago. Truly, I have never felt such pure joy and excitement as I did that evening. I remain a big fan and surprised myself even now by happily watching Get Back in its entirety three times. Alim Kheraj – the Spice Girls Like almost every queer child growing up in the 90s, I was obsessed with the Spice Girls, but never saw them live in their heyday. So, when Baby, Sporty, Scary, Ginger and Posh announced in 2007 they were doing a reunion tour I saw them twice. I went with my mum the second time – we were so close to the stage. I can still remember both of us getting emotional during the song Mama. That show also kickstarted a tradition in which my mum and I go to concerts together; we even saw the Spice Girls when they returned in 2019.Alim Kheraj is a freelance music, culture and LGBT journalist Richard Davies – Madonna in Manchester I retained a few tickets from the early days at the Haçienda. It was a venue I visited most during the 80s, attending numerous club nights and seeing bands such as the Cramps, A Certain Ratio, the Fall and Orange Juice. However, the most memorable was Madonna’s very first UK TV appearance there in early 1984, broadcast live on The Tube (though it wasn’t the most inspiring of performances). I don’t think anyone there would have predicted such global success for the artist we witnessed that evening, but perhaps that’s because we were in the presence of greatness: the real queen of showbiz, the one and only Pat Phoenix.Richard Davies is founder of face-value ticket exchange Twickets Joe Stone – Dollywood It is a lie that Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth. That distinction belongs to Dolly Parton’s theme park Dollywood, by virtue of the fact that every artificial rock plays her music – a public health measure that should be adopted globally. I pilgrimaged there aged 19, hitchhiking the last leg of the trip with one of Dolly’s former classmates (“Did you always know she’d be a star?” “We didn’t, but she did”). Disappointingly, most of the clientele seemed violently disinterested in the woman herself – there were lots of families in cut-off plaid eating mounds of tater tots – but that did at least mean I had free run of the Chasing Rainbows museum. My ticket was as camp, colourful and charmingly old-fashioned as the Dolly Lama herself. A forever reminder to be a diamond in a rhinestone world.Joe Stone is a commissioning editor at Guardian Saturday Jurgen Tittmar – Barack Obama’s presidential inauguration I kept a ticket from the Washington metro from 20 January 2009, the day of Obama’s first inauguration. I was visiting an old uni friend – Andy and I were there at 7am. Everywhere was packed but it was a carnival atmosphere, with high expectations. We passed someone dressed up as Death with a scythe and a sign that said: “Thanks Bush and Cheney for putting on such a good show.” I particularly liked the Irish Americans celebrating. We could see the snipers on top of the different museums on the Mall. It was all joyful, the hours waiting for noon flew by as we chatted to strangers. It was a privilege to be part of history but I’ve never been so cold in all my life. Rachel O’Riordan – Nigel Kennedy & the Cork Symphony OrchestraI kept the ticket to a 2007 Nigel Kennedy concert in Cork, where I was born.He was playing with the Cork Symphony Orchestra. My auntie Theresa plays in it – she organised tickets for us. I went with my mum, my dad, and my husband at the time. We were in that stage of shock bereavement – my brother Egan had recently died at 26. We were kind of blasted by grief. I sat watching Nigel, and I remember the intensity of his playing. His neck was bleeding where he was holding the violin under his chin. Then all my family started to cry: we were all weeping, watching. It had to do with the intensity of his performance. It felt to me that this is what art is for – for us to have a space for us to put ourselves when we’re in deep pain or deep joy. There is something about great art, and being in the presence of that, that allows you to feel something and feel it in a shared space. There, my profound grief was finding expression.Rachel O’Riordan directs the new comedy Scandaltown by Mike Bartlett at Lyric Hammersmith theatre to 14 May Steve Williams – unused Nirvana ticket I have kept a ticket of a Nirvana concert that was dated 6 April 1994, the day after Kurt Cobain took his own life. I was set to go with a group of mates and remember how excited we were. Some chose to return the tickets for a refund, but I couldn’t do that. I wanted to keep the ticket. I framed it and hung it on the wall in my little house, and it has been hung everywhere I lived as a single man, and then in the houses my wife and our children have lived in. Now I have two grownup boys who have found their own musical tastes. It stands as a timepiece of where our lives have ended up over the past 30 years. I imagine it will stay there until I’m carried out in a box. Andrew Pulver – New Model Army I am not much of a gig-goer; in fact I only ever went with any kind of enthusiasm in the mid-80s in the year after I left school. The absolute scuzziest one I ever went to was in 1984 at the Clarendon Hotel (now demolished), just round the corner from the Hammersmith Palais and Odeon – a sweat-drenched Edwardian dance hall that usually played host to squads of psychobilly bands. New Model Army, a bunch of snarling ranters from Bradford, were a bit different, and I particularly liked their vicious Small Town England song. I’m not going to say this gig [in 1984] changed my life, other than putting me off spending my evenings fighting for air and avoiding crush injuries, but it’s a memorial of the kind of insanity you get up to as a teenager.Andrew Pulver is film editor at guardian.co.uk Mark Cousins – opera in PragueMy most treasured ticket is from the Prague National Theatre in 1988. I was in my early 20s and Czechoslovakia, as it then was, was still communist. I’d never been to an opera, but friends told me I should go. It was standing room only, I’m not even sure what the opera was, but the price was, in UK money … 50p. One of the first times I’d come across the idea that big theatrical productions could be for ordinary people. For me, the faded ticket stands for discovery and possibility.Mark Cousins is director of The Story of Film: A New Generation Neville Goodman – Bob Dylan at the Free Trade Hall Dylan was acoustic in 1965. We went to the concert the following year [at Manchester Free Trade Hall] knowing that he’d “gone electric”. And yes, after the first acoustic half, when Dylan just seemed to be going through the motions, we walked out as the electric guitars struck up. I don’t remember the famous shout of “Judas” from the crowd. It is one of only two tickets I kept, and from one of the most seminal concerts ever. I left my umbrella under the seat, too: I could scarcely go back in to reclaim it. Vick Hope – AthleteI have a special little box in my old room at my parents’ house in Newcastle, brimming with miscellaneous musical memories. In there is the stub from perhaps the most pertinent: my first gig at the poly [Northumbria Students’ Union], a 13th birthday present to see the band Athlete with three friends and my dad. I was obsessed with them, knew every word to every song on Vehicles & Animals, spent all my time chatting to other fans on their online forums, had the lyrics to You Got the Style as my MSN Messenger name, and insisted to anyone else in year 9 who would listen that Athlete at the poly was the best of my life. Thus began the halcyon days of religiously reading NME and listening to indie bands’ albums with my eyes closed in my room on a Friday night – and that little box quickly filled up with ticket stubs for Aqualung, Jet, Get Cape Wear Cape Fly, Razorlight and the Coral. I’m getting emotional just thinking about it.Vick Hope is a presenter and broadcaster John Barry – Eurovision Song Contest, 1997 I was given two tickets to the 1997 Eurovision final in Dublin, which also came with a wooden box of chocolates, Eurovision pen and VIP afterparty access – I mingled with the likes of Boyzone, Terry Wogan, Katrina and the Waves. Why was this event special? It was the last time the UK won it. Kate Hutchinson – the OffspringI recently found a scrapbook of all the tickets I’d kept from my teenagehood, before music criticism coloured me cynical. First page, top left, above Foo Fighters: the Offspring, Wembley Arena, 2001. It was my first live experience, launched into the armpit of skate-punk as it went supersized. These shouty men in wraparound shades were the umbilical cord between my best friend and I. We were 13, high on hormones, and thought we were A+ teen tearaways because we wore shag bands. Who cared if we were getting picked up by my mum later: this was our Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, our Spike Island! The show itself is hazy – something about being pretty fly for white guys – but I do remember that we snuck menthol fags through in a tampon holder. When I look now at that faded bit of card, I miss the earnest girl who liked dumb music and who kept all her ticket stubs, like tiny totems of hopeful rebellion.Kate Hutchinson is a journalist and DJ, and creator of The Last Bohemians podcast Jo Woodworth – Kate Bush at the Manchester Apollo, 1979 My most special are the Kate Bush tickets from her first tour in 1979 and her second in 2014. Before the first one in Manchester I had seen mostly student gigs and this was a whole different level. I had never seen someone use a head mic before. We were so excited when the 2014 series of gigs were announced. The atmosphere was exhilarating. The old material brought back so many memories. We were sitting next to people not born in 1979. Akram Khan – The MahabharataPeter Brook’s The Mahabharata [which Khan performed in as a child] is one of those productions that changed me for ever – it also influenced and inspired a whole generation of artists around the world. For me, the whole experience was deeply affecting because it not only shaped the way I see the world today, but also how I approached my own myths … It is the only ticket I have ever held on to. The ticket is a record of the only time I actually saw the show as an audience member, since most often I was performing in it. The ticket is a sort of carrier or museum of my memories … my adolescence, my curiosity of art, and my confusion of the world we inhabit.Akram Khan is artistic director of the Akram Khan Company. His Jungle Book reimagined tours the UK this April Cristina Martins – Miles Davis in Lisbon I was in my early 20s when Miles Davis played live at the Lisbon Coliseum in 1991. I wanted to see him, as I knew he was ill. I asked all my friends if they wanted to come with me but no one fancied it so I went on my own. It was brilliant – I have a vivid memory of Miles on stage looking tired but still playing the trumpet like a star. He died soon after. Rebecca Nicholson – the Knife’s opera Tomorrow, in a YearIn my 20s, when I was a busy young music journalist, I bizarrely developed a sudden but crippling fear of flying. So when I was asked to interview one of my favourite acts, the Knife, in Sweden, I signed up to a defeat-your-phobia type course to fix the problem. It helped enough for me to get on a plane to Stockholm. The band were promoting their collaborative opera about Charles Darwin, called Tomorrow, in a Year, which sounds unbearable but was brilliant, and I sat through that performance at the Dansens Hus in 2010 beaming with joy. I framed the ticket as a reminder that even when life seems to contract, it is possible to open it up again.Rebecca Nicholson is a columnist for the Observer and Guardian Michael Fisher– Star Wars at the Gaumont Cinema, Birmingham I have a ticket to the Gaumont Cinema in Birmingham (now demolished) for entry to see Star Wars in 1978. I remember this so fondly because my friends and I had been waiting to see this film. The build-up had been going on for months. Back in the day you just turned up at the cinema to see a film, you couldn’t book in advance. I went with my mum and dad and best friend. We came out buzzing. All my Star Wars memorabilia from back then is long gone, but I never had the heart to throw this stub out. Lucy Knight – Cameron EspositoI am not usually one to hold on to things I don’t need any more, but my wife is the opposite: she holds on to letters, cards, posters and tickets that I’d have recycled long ago. Early in our relationship, I bought her a book to keep her old tickets in. Many of the gigs and events we’ve been to together have been documented in there, but one in particular makes me smile: it was for Cameron Esposito’s standup show at the Soho theatre in 2018. It was the first thing we went to together when I moved to London after dating long-distance, and we’d had it booked for ages. But somehow we’d got our dates confused and turned up on the wrong night, so we had to wait in the bar and see if there would be any returns. It could have been a big disappointment – I was working as a nanny at the time and had taken the night off especially – but happily some tickets became available just before the show. We were so pleased to be there and to be finally living in the same city that we didn’t care that we’d had to pay twice.Lucy Knight is a commissioning editor at the Guardian",Arts/Music,Madonna at the Haçienda to Obama’s inauguration: the tickets we can’t bear to throw away,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/09/writers-and-guardian-readers-prized-tickets
4/9/2022,"Rishi Sunak is under huge pressure over his financial affairs and those of his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire who made his money in IT. These are the key unanswered questions: Three days after it was revealed that Murty claims non-domicile status, allowing her to avoid UK tax on her foreign earnings, Murty and Sunak have failed to explain how much tax she paid on the £54.5m of dividends she collected over the past seven-and-a-half years. Sunak, who as chancellor oversees tax rules, said his wife paid all taxes due in the UK, “and every penny that she earns internationally, for example in India, she would pay the full taxes on that”. Critics pointed out he said Murty “would pay” full taxes on overseas income, not that she had paid it or stated how much. They said Sunak gave India only as an example, leaving open the possibility that Murty may have used a tax haven, where no taxes would have been due. She has previously collected other dividend income in Mauritius, a tax haven. The couple had green cards when living in the US before Sunak became an MP, but still had them until late in 2019 – when Sunak was already chancellor. Green card holders must file annual US tax returns and are “responsible for reporting your income and paying taxes on any foreign earned income”. One major questions is whether Murty paid US taxes on her Infosys dividends, but not UK tax, while taking advantage of her non-dom status. Sunak said Murty did not want to become a British citizen because she regarded herself as Indian and she was planning to return to India. “She loves her country like I love mine”, he said. However, people applying to become US green card holders are required to make a legal commitment to “make the US your permanent home”. It is legitimate to ask why Murty was prepared to make the US her home for tax purposes, but chose to take advantage of her non-dom status to legally avoid paying UK tax when her husband was the second-most powerful person in government. When Sunak was appointed chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 he waived his salary for five months – a total of £34,000. Instead he earned the MP’s basic salary, which was then about £81,932. This is about $103,000 at today’s exchange rate. This is just under the maximum threshold of ($108,700) that US green card holders can earn overseas and avoid paying US income tax, under the foreign earned income exclusion scheme. Sunak and the Treasury did not comment. A government source said Sunak did not take his full ministerial salary for the first five months because the Cabinet Office asked him to forgo it as it had reached the maximum cap for ministerial salaries that year. Murty’s earnings are not made public, because Sunak has not declared anything on his register of ministerial interests beyond her ownership of a UK vehicle called Catamaran Ventures UK. There is no mention of her shareholding in Infosys, or any other financial interest. It is not clear why this has been considered not relevant to the declaration, but ministers usually discuss their financial situation with the prime minister’s adviser on ministerial interests before it is decided what they need to make public. There are huge unanswered questions over Sunak’s blind trust and what shareholdings or other investments have gone in it. The first mention of Sunak’s trust appeared in 2019, when he became a Treasury minister, but it is possible he had shareholdings in it before that. The MPs register of interest says MPs do not have to declare the existence of blind trusts to the public and that MPs do not know how their assets are being invested, and are not allowed to give instructions about investments. However, they can receive reports on the trust’s overall performance, realise the assets, and give general directions about the investments when the trust is established. This means Sunak may be aware roughly what is in his blind trust. Before he became an MP, he was involved in managing hedge funds, including Theleme and the Children’s Investment Fund, which have links to the Cayman Islands.",News/Politics,Five key questions Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty have yet to answer,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/09/five-key-questions-rishi-sunak-and-akshata-murty-have-yet-to-answer
