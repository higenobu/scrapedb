1/16/2022,"The former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly close to reaching a plea bargain in his corruption trial, a development that could mean an unexpectedly swift end to his turbulent political career and once again upend Israeli politics. Israeli media was dominated on Sunday by the news that Netanyahu, the chair of the Likud party and leader of the opposition since being ousted from a 12-year-stint in government last year, has reached advanced talks with the state attorney’s office.  In the reported agreement, Netanyahu will admit to two counts of breach of trust, resulting in a suspended prison sentence and a few months of prison time that will be converted to community service. The major remaining sticking point appears to be the insistence of the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, on a charge of moral turpitude – a formal declaration that Netanyahu is desperate to avoid. The former prime minister is on trial accused of trading preferential treatment for a major Israeli telecom company in exchange for positive articles on its Walla news site. He is also a defendant in a second case involving claims of soliciting favourable coverage, and a third alleging he received gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy friends. The 72-year-old rejected calls to step down after he was indicted in 2019, using the podium as prime minister to repeatedly lash out at law enforcement, the media and the courts for launching a “witch hunt” against him. His trial formally began in 2020 while the country was embroiled in a two-year-long political crisis in which there were four elections, with voters deadlocked over Netanyahu’s leadership and indictment. Proceedings against him had been expected to drag on for years – but with Mandelblit’s term as attorney general due to end later this month, and his replacement unlikely to prioritise Netanyahu’s cases, it appears the former prime minister’s legal team has decided the window for a plea bargain is closing. The retired supreme court president Aharon Barak, a longstanding ally of Netanyahu, has reportedly acted as the liaison between the former prime minister and state prosecutors. Speaking to the Ynet news website, he said of his role in the negotiations: “In my view, this is a unique indictment and trial, which is causing a rift in the nation. In the attempt to heal that rift, a plea bargain is the preferable option. This position is positive and vital for the state of Israel.” The daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Sunday quoted a Likud source as saying that in recent months Netanyahu, who had kept the deal talks secret from his party, had “shifted into a lower gear”. The former prime minister was “less centred, less focused, he didn’t participate much in Knesset plenum meetings, he cancelled faction meetings. The only thing he did was attack senior party members and post childish videos on TikTok. That’s no way to lead the opposition.” A plea deal could see Netanyahu banned from political life for up to seven years, effectively ending his career. It would also trigger a leadership contest for Likud, the fallout from which could reverberate in unpredictable ways. The Likud could descend into internal warfare over the election of a new chair, hindering its attempts to destabilise the diverse coalition government that was sworn in last June. However, if the party does manage to comprehensively agree on a new leader, rightwing elements of the governing coalition might consider scrapping the current arrangement in favour of a more politically coherent government with the new Likud chair at its head. As well as striking a deal over his corruption charges, Netanyahu is also considering a compromise in a defamation case against his predecessor as prime minister, Ehud Olmert. The Likud leader has demanded 837,000 shekels (£197,000) in damages from Olmert over allegations he made in interviews that Netanyahu, his wife Sara and eldest son, Yair – also rightwing figures – are mentally ill. Judge Amit Yariv suggested in a hearing last week that Olmert state his comments were opinion rather than fact – a compromise that a Netanyahu family spokesperson said was acceptable, although there was no immediate indication that Olmert would accept it. Other than Netanyahu, Olmert is the only Israeli prime minister to face trial for corruption-related charges. He was found guilty in 2015 and served two-thirds of a 27-month sentence for fraud.",News/World news,Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly near to plea bargain in corruption trial,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-plea-bargain-trial
1/16/2022,"A man who was shot dead by FBI officers after taking four people hostage at a Texas synagogue is understood to be British. The man began a standoff with police after disrupting a religious service at the Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan are, and taking hostages including the rabbi. He released one hostage unharmed after six hours.  More than 10 hours after the siege began, members of the FBI’s hostage rescue team stormed the synagogue to free the three remaining hostages. They were said to be “alive and well” after the siege had been brought to an end. Reports suggested that a live-stream of the Shabbat service, available on Facebook during the standoff until it was cut off at 2pm local time, captured audio of a man talking in an English accent. On Sunday, a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) spokesperson said: “We are aware of the death of a British man in Texas and are in contact with the local authorities.” The police department said it first sent in Swat teams at the synagogue in response to emergency calls beginning at about 10.40am. The FBI made contact with the man who said he wanted to speak to a woman held in a federal prison. In the livestream, the hostage-taker was heard demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist suspected of having ties to al-Qaida, who was convicted of trying to kill US military officers while in custody in Afghanistan, a law enforcement official said. Siddiqui is in federal prison in Texas. Before the livestream was ended, a man could be heard ranting and talking about religion and his sister, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. The man could be heard saying repeatedly he did not want to see anyone hurt and that he believed he was going to die, the newspaper said.

It tells of a small Welsh community that bands together to save their listed art deco cinema (which also doubles as the home for the local youth theatre) from shifty developers who want to pull it down and build a mall. It’s an Ealing-alike gentle comedy populated by lovable eccentrics, and in Samantha Morton and Jonathan Pryce punches considerably above its weight in terms of casting. But the film-making decisions – from a score that sounds as though it was borrowed from an advertisement for life insurance, to the toffee and treacle colour palette, to a screenplay that is amiable, inoffensive but rarely funny – suggest that perhaps the cinema wasn’t worth saving after all.

1/16/2022,"Up until pretty recently, Guy Garvey says, he couldn’t have sat very comfortably in a place like this. We are in Roka in Charlotte Street in London’s West End, flagship of the discreetly expensive chain of Japanese restaurants, where attentive staff bring artful platters of exquisitely sliced fish and explain precisely in which order you might best consume them. “Before I met my wife I had a difficult relationship with restaurants,” Garvey says. “I never was that happy being waited on – I’d always be apologising and all ‘if it’s not too much trouble’. When we were first going out, Rachel said, ‘Do you like sushi?’ I said, ‘No not really.’ And she said, ‘Have you ever had sushi?’ I said, ‘No not really.’ She took me to this fabulous sushi place and she is great at just being natural in these places and I was immediately a convert.” This newfound ease does not extend quite to ordering; we both, diehard provincials, are a bit flummoxed by the menu, so ask for recommendations and a procession of delicate sharing plates starts to arrive, fabulous morsels of yellow-tail tartare and crab gyoza and tiger prawn tempura, which, big-shouldered blokes, we carefully manipulate with chopsticks. Garvey and his band Elbow are in some eyes a byword for northern integrity and soul. He met his bandmates at school in Bury, Greater Manchester and they have, with one exception, stayed together for 30 years and nine albums. Their first gig was at the Corner Pin pub in Ramsbottom in 1990; they now fill arenas, but Garvey has long been wary of stardom.  “I’ve never been a sort of ‘repel all boarders’ Mancunian,” he says. “But I used to really enjoy having a jibe about London. Not just London, south Manchester. I used to tell a story about slipping on an avocado skin in Chorlton. And then five years ago I fell for a Londoner and moved here. And it took me a while to realise what my problem used to be. I was a bit frightened of the scale of it. It just takes you a while to find your feet. I live in Norwood, just down the road from Brixton, and I love it.” The Londoner Garvey fell for was the actor Rachael Stirling, star of Tipping the Velvet. They have a son Jack, who is four. Lockdown has been an intensely emotional time for the family. Stirling is the daughter of Diana Rigg. On the day after the original shutdown – Stirling had just opened in a play at the Lyric, Elbow had been set to embark on a world tour – they discovered Rigg had terminal cancer, and she moved in with them. Stirling nursed her mother at home until her death in September 2020. “Diana was so incredibly brave – and cool about it,” Garvey says. “There were offers of treatment, but she was like, no, no, I’ve had enough. She was a hoot. She read to our son Jack for as long as she could in the evenings. She had lots of visitors and we had codes worked out for when to get rid of them. There were Camparis at three o’clock every day. By the end, her and Rach were practically thinking with the same mind.” Garvey found himself quite often awake in the night, writing bits of songs in the dark. The result is perhaps Elbow’s most mellow and heartfelt album, Flying Dream 1, which includes a lot of the raw emotion of that period. One love song, What Am I Without You, sounds like a father to son lyric, but was written with Stirling in mind. “It’s about watching this miracle of her care for Diana, watching her walk on the water and reminding her to eat and to sleep.” During the same period Elbow started to perform a series of Friday evening online sessions from their respective homes. Fans would request favourite songs – Magnificent, Mirrorball, Lippy Kids – and they’d do one a week. “On the first one my head was absolutely in the stars,” Garvey says. “I didn’t make the bed in the background and I was wearing my dressing gown. A friend sent me a message: ‘Great song, put some fucking clothes on.’” After that he wore Hawaiian shirts. They recorded the album in Brighton’s Theatre Royal, which by then had been shut down for longer than at any time in its 200-year history. Garvey suggests he wanted a place that echoed with lost laughter. “It’s a populist kind of theatre, you know, it smells of Gary Wilmot and Shane Richie. It was sad to see it dark.” The sudden, strange quiet seems preserved on the album, which finds Garvey in introspective moods (at a distance from the stadium-rocking joys of One Day Like This). Some of the songs take him back to his childhood growing up with five older sisters and a younger brother. Their dad worked as a proofreader at the Daily Mirror in Manchester – when we meet at Roka, Garvey has just come from a short interview with that paper, reminiscing about his old man, after a journalist spotted his lyric in the title track: “Dad’s across town tonight fixing the Mirror / Shaking his head at a richer man’s grammar”. “I like that idea that people don’t really die until the last time someone remembers them. My dad died not long after Jack was born; he’d have loved seeing himself in the Mirror.” Even as a teenager, Garvey says he was writing bits of poetry and lyrics, thinking of how they would age. “I think I realised very quickly that the further away in time you get from a diary entry or a note on a page makes it really emotionally interesting in ways that you can’t quite fathom.” We talk a little about the ways in which music is often all about nostalgia for a certain time and place. Garvey mentions that he was invited along to the premiere of Get Back, Peter Jackson’s film of unseen Beatles footage. Garvey was sitting two rows behind Paul McCartney and could see his face as he was watching himself “back there in the room again with his mates, just drinking it all in”. He doesn’t know McCartney, but he got an email off him once. “He said he was dropping off his grandkids at school, but he’d stayed in the car to listen to who a song on the radio was by, and it was our song Magnificent, so he sent us a note. I was like: ‘Our work here is done.’ If I’m having a dark tea time of the soul, I just remember that.” We realise the waiters are going to keep bringing plates until we tell them to stop. We call a halt at some plump scallops and sit into the late afternoon sipping beers. As anyone who has listened to his songs might imagine, Garvey is a warm and honest presence, quick to find a joke, curious, self-effacing. He talks frankly of depressive periods when Elbow became a Mercury award-winning success, and he was drinking a bottle of scotch just to get on stage. He had therapy which helped unearth some demons of doubt (“I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t benefit from that kind of digging,” he says of analysis) but growing up, growing older with the band also helped. I wonder if, 30 years on, they still have those moments of collective excitement, as depicted in the Beatles film, where the disparate individuals, hearing a melody, come together? “We don’t often write together like that these days,” Garvey says, “but certainly sometimes in the studio someone will try something and everyone picks it up.” He has learned over the years that inspiration might come at any time, but when it does, you have to be able to catch it. He had a moment like that a couple of days after Diana Rigg died. “If I find myself excited about an idea I immediately switch my phone off and don’t pause for anything until I’m at the piano. I just had this melody and those words ‘is it a bird, is it a plane?’ and I was thinking there weren’t many planes in the sky just then, and I realised I was singing about Diana, ‘or is it a beautiful jettisoned warrior’s soul?’.” What good songs can capture, Garvey suggests, is that “nobody feels one thing at one time. I was missing Diana and heartbroken for Rachael and Jack, but there was also this huge feeling of elation that I’d helped Rachael give her mother an amazing death. I think you can hear it all in that one loop.” Walking home, I listen to the track again and Garvey is not wrong, it’s all there, just as he hoped. Flying Dream 1 is out now on Polydor.

1/16/2022,"It was October 2020 when I realised I was going to have to ask for help. I’ve always been anxious, but thanks to the pandemic, I developed debilitating health anxiety. A dire winter was coming and any respite we’d had over the summer felt like it was slipping away. I couldn’t get to sleep and when I finally did, I had nightmares. My stomach churned and my hands shook so badly I had to give up caffeine. I developed a chronic reflux cough and, on more than one occasion, got into such an irrational spiral about it being Covid that I had to book a PCR test just to be able to function. “One of the most diabolical things about this pandemic is the on and on-ness of it all,” says Amanda Ripley, author of The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes – and Why. “Humans can withstand a lot of turmoil and instability if they can recover.” Prior to Covid, Ripley studied people who survived tornadoes and terror attacks, emergencies for which the mental health consequences are much better understood than the long, slow-burn, seemingly endless one we find ourselves living through.  As Ripley knows, this is not the first disaster humans have had to live through, so are there things we can learn from other disasters about what they do to our brains, relationships and communities? And, more importantly, how to make things better? “There’s a tremendous amount we can learn from how we’ve responded to previous emergencies,” say Dr Brandon Kohrt, professor of psychiatry at George Washington University, who works in Liberia, Uganda and Nepal, dealing with the mental health aftermath of everything from Ebola to earthquakes. “Many low- and middle-income countries, like South Africa, India and Uganda, immediately rolled out mental health and psychosocial plans in February, March and April 2020. They had experienced prior disasters, but these approaches could be just as beneficial in high-resource places like the US and UK,” he tells me, and I can’t help wondering, do we in the Global North think of ourselves with such superiority that we find it hard to learn from the experiences of the Global South? “With population-wide trauma, a war or a terrorist attack, we heal socially,” says Kohrt. “Being together when the awful thing happens and then healing together is really crucial. People who come together in that healing process tend to do better than those who either self-isolate as a response to distress or are ostracised. So I think what’s happened with Covid is that although the stress isn’t necessarily as acute or sudden as an earthquake or an explosion, the isolation we all experienced in the context of stress and trauma is eating away at us psychologically.” Not everyone who experiences a disaster will develop a mental health problem: people survive trauma well all the time, but “between 5 and 10% of people who’ve been through traumatic events such as a terrorist attack will go on to develop clinical levels of PTSD,” says Dr Sarita Robinson, who studies the psychobiology of survival at the University of Central Lancashire. Around one in five people who experience a humanitarian emergency will go on to develop a mental health problem (prevalence of common mental health problems in the global population is about 1 in 10), and rates of serious mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, increase from 2-3% to 3-4%. “Research from 2018 suggested mental health problems double in emergency settings. I wouldn’t be surprised if that turned out to be the result of the pandemic, too,” says Ashley Nemiro, senior adviser for the global Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Network, which helps people working in crises. The psychological challenges of Covid are huge, but many practitioners feel they aren’t being addressed at all. Willem van de Put is co-founder of the Mental Health in Complex Emergencies course. “Covid has made things worse and, to the chagrin of leaders in global mental health, everybody is saying we should do something but, basically, absolutely nothing is happening. Governments are not willing to address it.” Investment in mental health is so low that, as Nemiro puts it: “Every country is a developing country when it comes to mental health services.” Research this year by the Centre for Mental Health, a thinktank, suggests that 8 million British adults and 1.5 million children will need mental health support in the next 10 years as a direct result of the pandemic. Office for National Statistics data already shows rates of depression doubling since the pandemic began, but it isn’t being evenly felt, says Leila Reyburn of mental health charity Mind. “The people who’ve been impacted the most and are continuing to feel that impact are people who had pre-existing mental health problems, people of colour, those living in deprivation and young people.” “In the UK, we have a system based on late intervention and crisis response,” says Andy Bell from the Centre for Mental Health. “Only a third of people with common mental health problems get support. We don’t offer it quickly and we tend to wait until people’s needs are so severe that they need specialised treatment.” But work by Kohrt and colleagues shows that early intervention is effective, especially for common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety – and that it doesn’t always have to be carried out by highly trained professionals. He implements a community-level post-emergency support programme called Problem Management Plus, first developed by the World Health Organization in Pakistan and Kenya in 2015, which he then successfully trialled in Nepal (with similar programmes now running all over the middle- and lower-income world). Through the programme, anyone with a high-school education can be trained in just a few weeks to deliver psychological support to those who need it, often embedded in places where people seek help for problems with housing or employment, rather than specifically for mental health. Clients get five weekly 90-minute sessions, usually one-to-one, or longer sessions in a small group, and are taught stress-management skills, breath control, problem solving, how to overcome inertia and how to develop a social support network. The final session is about how not to relapse. “We’re taking interventions that were developed for earthquakes, floods or war, which we’ve used for years, and using them in New York City right now,” Kohrt says. “It doesn’t have to be by psychiatrists or psychologists in a specialised clinical location.” Similar early intervention projects do exist in the UK, but they’re few and far between. A coalition of charities, including the Children and Young People’s Mental Health Coalition, Mind, YoungMinds and the Children’s Society, is currently trying to push government to “Fund the Hubs’’ and create a network of informal community support centres for children and young people, to which they can self refer. One such hub, the Nest, is already up and running in the London borough of Southwark – and 78% of its users say their wellbeing has improved. This won’t shock you, but the ongoing nature of the pandemic really isn’t good for us. “Our brains operate in a very different way when they experience prolonged threats: you’re constantly on edge and alert, and that shrinks our ability to empathise with others,” says Kohrt. “We become much more focused on a very tight-knit group, and everybody else seems a threat. What’s most challenging about the pandemic is that even family members became threats – especially pre-vaccines. If kids are going to be a threat to their grandparents’ health or vice versa, suddenly we’re on alert even with people who should be helping us.” This disrupts our ability to be empathic in general. “We become more prejudiced, we become more stigmatising, we become more discriminating.” And if we’re discriminating against our loved ones, imagine how much worse our broader societal discrimination and stigmatisation is.” Which explains quite a lot about now, doesn’t it? Some of us may find it harder to regulate our emotions, too, says Kohrt, something I can identify with. “We call it ‘self-regulation’, but it’s always a mix of self-regulation and regulation with others. Total reliance on self-regulation of emotions doesn’t work. We’ve evolved to constantly regulate our emotions with our peers.” But even if you were locked down with your family, that might not have helped. “Family units are connected to many other people as well, and if they don’t have contact with extended family, friends, peers, then that family’s own emotional regulation gets disrupted.” “In humanitarian emergencies, one of the biggest things we do is make sure people have a sense of control and agency,” says Nemiro. “Often that is taken away when their social fabric is destroyed – and the pandemic did the same thing.” While schools, churches and community centres weren’t reduced to rubble, as they might have been in other disasters, they became so hard to access that they might as well have vanished. “Lack of social connection, lack of community and feeling out of control all break down mental health,” says Nemiro. “The first thing we need is to realise that we have to repair the social fabric,” says Amanda Ripley. “People come to me all the time saying: ‘We don’t know what to do – our church, our school, our town is exploding with conflict.’ There’s so much pent-up frustration, alienation and sadness that has not been dealt with – we will find a target of convenience. After every disaster, there’s a short golden hour of solidarity [rainbows in windows! Clap for carers!] followed by a deep valley of division. Repairing the social fabric needs to be an explicit mission.” Luckily, the repairs can be simple. “Say I’m a head teacher and I’m going to have parents come to an event in person. Afterwards, I don’t just let everybody go – these are opportunities for connection and we are in a deficit situation – so I serve drinks and snacks outside for half an hour afterward.” So is the casual socialising that we previously thought so little of – the school plays, the church fêtes – more important than we noticed at the time? “Those things are not just pleasant and fun: they’re investments in your future sanity and wellbeing. The way you build community resilience is through knowing each other so that we don’t assume the worst, so that it gets a little harder to demonise each other, and that prepares us for the next disaster,” says Ripley. Bruce Daisley, former VP of Twitter, has written a book about resilience, Fortitude. “Police and firefighters who were in the thick of the events of 9/11 have been well researched and generally the closer they report being to their colleagues, the better protection to their mental health they felt,” he says. “Resilience is social strength, and social connectedness helps us recover better from operations, prevents us from falling into depression and generally improves wellbeing.” “A huge part of emotional regulation requires positive interactions with others, including touch – if you look at other species, the way that that’s done is through grooming and other non-sexual touch among group members. We’ve had so little opportunity for that,” says Kohrt. Connecting when we’re in distress is even more powerful. “If I’m not the one in distress, I can help you regulate your distress,” he says. “There’s a feedback loop between the helper and the helpee with neurobiological changes that are health-promoting for both, to the point where helping others probably reduces our inflammatory responses and improves our antiviral responses.” If we remain in Ripley’s valley of division, though, then “we’re vulnerable to conflict entrepreneurs,” she says. “It is incredibly easy to turn us against each other, whether you’re a politician, pundit or social-media platform. We need to know that and remind ourselves that we don’t want to be played this way. We’re not going to be chumps.” One way to offset that particular danger as well as helping us to cope with the aftermath of an emergency is to deliberately tell ourselves a story of the experience which allows us to have agency within it. “Reappraisal is one of the main ways we manage our emotions as humans, and it’s probably one of the most sophisticated tricks of the mind,” says Ripley. “Are there stories we can tell ourselves that are true, but also leave us some hope? Yes there has been real suffering and hardship, but maybe you or your child showed remarkable resilience in finding a way to adapt or to be with that loss and still create new things.” Ripley suggests spending 15 minutes writing your own story of the pandemic, but as though you were a benign third party, observing (you can also do this with kids). “With writing there’s a kind of organisation of the experience that happens in the brain, that you don’t have the space to do when you’re in a disaster that keeps going on and on. Writing a story can create that space and since there’s not enough space for recovery in this type of slow disaster, we have to create it.” Coincidentally, I recently tried something similar, inspired by an article by Daisy Dowling in the Harvard Business Review. Rather than a story, she encourages us to list our achievements throughout the pandemic – which could include not snapping all your child’s pencils in an impotent rage while home schooling, or cooking 654 dinners in a row since March 2020, as well as more traditional wins. It was an uplifting way to look back and reframe the shitshow of the last two years. Does writing a story give the emergency a longed-for ending, too? “The brain wants an ending because the brain needs psychological certainty,” says Ripley. “There is no end, but by repeatedly creating a narrative that has a conclusion maybe we could give it an end.” Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

1/16/2022,"On Fridays, the pub next to Forest Gate community school in east London starts filling up from 1pm. It has not always been this way, but ever since the school went down to a four-and-a-half-day week, it has been flooded with exhausted teachers keen to take advantage of their shorter week as quickly as possible. Other teachers use the afternoon to spend more time with their children, go on a mini-break, catch up on work they would have done at the weekend, or attend the local mosque. The important thing is that the afternoon is theirs to choose how they spend it, says Simon Elliott, who leads the multi-academy trust that runs Forest Gate.  The initiative has been so successful that the school is now consulting on whether to reduce the week further, to four days. Elliott opted to shorten the week after reading a series of alarming reports on professional stress and burnout for teachers. “If you look at the amount of work teachers do, they do more than similar professions and the workload is very high. I wanted to try and alleviate that pressure at a structural level,” he said. To achieve this, he removed two pastoral periods from the schedule on Friday and added the four other 50-minute lessons on to weekdays. Children can stay on site to do homework or extracurricular activities. Elliott said the change has resulted in happier, more energetic teachers – an internal survey showed 98% appreciated the change. Pupils, who often struggle to focus on Friday afternoons, say they enjoy the extra time to spend with friends, or doing extracurricular activities and homework, and have received higher grades since, leading to satisfied parents. Tom Leather, a PE teacher, said the shorter working week had transformed his life. Before Covid, he went on weekend breaks to Europe, and now his wife is pregnant he is looking forward to having more time to spend with his new child, and later to pick them up from nursery. “Knowing we’re allowed to leave at 12.10 on Friday means that morale is better. Happier teachers work harder and produce better days,” he said. The move to four days is the subject of a new report by thinktank Autonomy, which is making the case for all schools to adopt a four-day week, reflecting a growing trend in the US where 1,600 schools have already shortened timetables. The report argues that shortening the week would help reduce the high numbers of teachers who leave the profession by cutting their hours, which, at an average of 51, are among the longest in Europe. The UK’s Health and Safety Executive found that teaching staff report the highest rates of work-related stress, depression and anxiety in the UK. The idea is popular among teachers, at least theoretically. Autonomy’s survey of 500 found that three-quarters would be interested in a 32-hour four-day week if pay is not cut, and over two-thirds said it would encourage them to remain in the profession. Elliott said there were barriers to rolling this out at present, however, including childcare routines and longer days in school. “It would give people a lot of freedom, they can be creative in their spare time, and feel a bit more rested. The problems to solve are around the logistics of people’s lives.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the union “would be happy to discuss any thinking about the structure of the school term and week”, although he has not received calls from members about a universal move to four days and the union’s main priorities to address retention are improved pay, flexible working and a supportive approach from government. “Any suggested change would need to be supported by evidence that it would have a positive impact on pupil outcomes,” he said. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Maintained schools are legally required to operate at least 190 school days a year and, now more than ever as children get back on track, we want all schools to be offering at least an average of 32.5 hours a week.”",News/Education,Happier teachers and higher grades: the London school that shortened the week,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/16/happier-teachers-and-higher-grades-the-london-school-that-shortened-the-week
1/16/2022,"A group of criminologists, penal reformers and ex-offenders have expressed “dismay” at Cambridge University’s decision to scrap a programme that taught prisoners alongside students after the deadly attack at Fishmongers’ Hall at one of its events. They include some of the people who survived the attack by terrorist Usman Khan when he stabbed to death Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, while wearing a fake suicide vest. The November 2019 killings occurred at an event to mark the fifth anniversary of the prisoner education scheme Learning Together.  Last week, the Guardian revealed that the university had decided to halt the programme following criticism by a coroner over its approach to safety. Now, an open letter to the university’s vice-chancellor, signed by more than 70 people, derides the move as a “betrayal” of the aims of Learning Together. It said: “This seeming retreat into its comfort zone … strikes us as a retrograde step, particularly for an institution putatively committed to ‘widening access’.” Among the signatories are John Crilly and Marc Conway, two former prisoners and Learning Together alumni who were at the Fishmongers’ Hall event and forced Khan on to nearby London Bridge where he was shot dead by police. At an inquest into the killings, Crilly and Conway were praised for their bravery. In a prevention of future deaths report, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said there were collective failures by the security services, police and probation officers to prevent the attack. But he was also critical of Learning Together’s lax attitude to security when it invited Khan to the event. The inquest had heard that Learning Together regarded Khan as a “poster boy” for the programme, and had appeared in one of its promotional videos after taking part in several of its courses while at Whitemoor high security prison. The inquest jury said the authorities had a “blind spot to Khan’s unique risks due to his ‘poster boy’ image and lack of psychological assessment post released from prison”. Last week, Cambridge University said there would be “clear stop” to Learning Together after an internal review. Conway urged the university to reconsider. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, he said: “This [the letter] is from people from all walks of life: professors, doctors, people that work in criminal justice system. We just don’t understand the rationale for the decision.” “It goes against the advice that the university itself commissioned which said Learning Together could feasibly be delivered in a way that minimises and appropriately manages its risk.” Conway added: “The Learning Together programme dramatically changed my life for the better. We we have real concern that people will miss out and not get the opportunity of that and could go on to reoffend.” Last week, Jack’s father, Dave Merritt, told the Guardian that he was saddened that programme was coming to an end, but said: “The course leaders were idealistic, ambitious for the programme and naive about the risks that dangerous, high-risk, category A, Terrorist Act offenders such as Khan pose.” He added: “All the agencies in managing Khan – prison, probation, police, MI5 – regarded his involvement with Learning Together as a ‘protective factor’, in the absence of any evidence to support this. In the words of our barrister, Nick Armstrong of Matrix Chambers, it was if they were intoxicated by the ‘fairy dust Learning Together sprinkled over them’.” Cambridge University referred to its statement from last week that acknowledged that Learning Together “helped change many lives for the better” but confirmed it would be scrapped.",News/Society,‘Dismay’ at Cambridge University decision to axe prisoner scheme after terror attack,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/16/dismay-at-cambridge-university-decision-to-axe-prisoner-scheme-after-terror-attack
1/16/2022,"Ella Hickson’s adaptation of JM Barrie’s world-famous story of “the boy who wouldn’t grow up” adjusts its emphasis towards Wendy. In Barrie’s 1904 play and 1911 novel, Wendy flies off from her London nursery, along with her two brothers, to follow Pan to Neverland. Once there, in an embodiment of Edwardian domestic virtues, she becomes a mother figure to Pan’s gang of Lost Boys. As Hickson points out in the programme, even in the early 20th century this was a limited view of a woman’s role: “Emmeline Pankhurst and the suffragettes would have been on the front page of all the newspapers when Barrie [was writing] …” Hickson continues. “I wanted to give [Wendy] something to achieve, to strive for.” Here, therefore, Wendy is on a quest: to find her own “lost boy” – a third brother, Tom, who has died in the opening scenes of the play.  Amber James skilfully brings out the complexities of Hickson’s Wendy: admirable in her courage and determination; moving in her vulnerability; trying to find her place in a boy-shaped world, and to make common cause with the bolshie Tink (Hope Kenna) and warrior-like Tiger Lily (Ami Okumura Jones). James’s Wendy is perfectly counterpointed by Pierro Niel-Mee’s Pan, crowingly committed to leading his Lost Boys into battle against David Birrell’s time-haunted Captain Hook and his pirate gang; fearless in the face of death, that “great adventure”, yet recoiling from responsibility and emotion. Hickson’s quest theme, however, never really meshes dramatically with Barrie’s story. In spite of dynamic direction from Jonathan Munby and Rupert Hands, the action moves in fits and starts. That said, the production always looks spectacular. Developed by Leeds Playhouse along with the Japanese organisation Bunkamura, and first performed in Tokyo last year, its shifting sets (by Colin Richmond) and space-cheating projections (Taiki Ueda) set imaginations flying.

1/16/2022,"In a business etiquette workshop designed to prepare prospective executives for potential encounters with their western counterparts, an instructor with a polished Stepford veneer briefs her class on hugging protocol and the correct number of teeth to show in a smile (the answer is eight). In a workshop in Zhongshan, a team of women lovingly craft bespoke silicone sex dolls. Meanwhile, in a food processing plant, workers in fat-splattered aprons sift through piles of entrails and duck carcass off-cuts. Trainee butlers, destined to work for China’s new ultra-wealthy, are briefed on cutlery use and the importance of remaining impassive in the face of unreasonable behaviour. And in a deserted mall in a ghost city, built by developers but subsequently abandoned, stands the world’s saddest ostrich, alone in a bleak petting zoo, an attraction for the shoppers who never came.  Jessica Kingdon’s fascinating observational documentary, which looks at aspiration, manufacture, consumption and waste in China, is full of such intriguing snapshots. Accompanied by a lithe, organic score by Dan Deacon, which weaves the rhythms of industry and technology into the music, the film is a mosaic portrait of the realities and repercussions of “the Chinese dream”.",Arts/Film,Ascension review – surreally fascinating snapshots of ‘the Chinese dream’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/16/ascension-review-jessica-kingdon-surreal-snapshots-chinese-dream
