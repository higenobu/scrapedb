2/10/2022,"A blind salamander, a tap-dancing spider and a “fat” catfish that has been likened to the Michelin man are among a list of vanished species that one US-based conservation group is aiming to rediscover in the wild and help protect. The Texas-based group, called Re:wild, has drawn up a new list of the “25 most wanted lost species” as part of its quest to find species lost to science and possibly extinct.  The most wanted list includes the “fat” catfish, which has not been seen in its known habitat in Colombia since 1957. The species is the only freshwater catfish in the world with rings of fatty tissue wrapped around its body, leading to it being described by scientists who have previously searched for it as “the closest a fish could get to the Michelin man”. Michael Edmondstone, communications and engagement lead at Shoal, a conservation group for freshwater species, said the organization is “tremendously excited by the prospect of the fish being found”. He added: “Everybody is hoping to learn more about it and, ultimately, put the right measures in place to ensure it can thrive for future generations.” The Togo mouse, lost from Togo and Ghana, is a ground-dwelling mammal that is still recognized by locals who call it “Yefuli” despite its last confirmed appearance being in 1890, while a blind amphibian that dwells in underground aquifers in the US, called the Blanco blind salamander, has not been seen since 1951. “The Blanco blind salamander has achieved near-mythical status among herpetologists, cave biologists, and conservationists,” said Andrew Gluesenkamp, director of conservation at the San Antonio Zoo. Meanwhile, the Fagilde’s trapdoor spider, known for building horizontal traps and tap dancing in front of potential mates, is being sought after seemingly vanishing from its home range in Portugal in 1931. There are species of plant on the new list, including the big puma fungus, not seen in South America since the 1980s, and pernambuco holly, a tree species in Brazil not recorded since 1838. Re:wild, which has the actor Leonardo DiCaprio as a founding board member, is also continuing to search for Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna, named in honor of Sir David Attenborough, which hasn’t been spotted in 60 years and is one of just five existing species of monotreme, which is a group of egg-laying mammals found in Australia and New Guinea. A tree-dwelling kangaroo from Indonesia and a pink-headed duck from India are also being sought by the organization. Since starting its search for lost species in 2017, Re:wild has confirmed the rediscovery of eight species through expeditions and scientific analysis, including a type of giant tortoise in the Galapagos islands and the world’s largest bee, found in Indonesia. There are many more species lost to science, however, with an estimated 2,200 species across 160 countries missing for 10 years or more. The loss of habitat, pollution, rampant hunting and climate change is fueling what scientists have described as the Earth’s sixth mass extinction, and the first to be driven by one species, in this case humans. “When we launched the search for lost species, we weren’t sure if anyone would rediscover any of the wildlife on our most wanted list,” said Barney Long, Re:wild’s senior director of conservation strategies. “Each new rediscovery has reminded us that we can find hope in even the most unlikely situations and that these stories of overlooked, but fascinating, species can be a powerful antidote to despair.” Long said the organization was now looking to conduct research expeditions and devise conservation programs for rediscovered species.",News/Environment,"Wanted lost species: blind salamander, tap-dancing spider and ‘fat’ catfish",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/09/most-wanted-lost-species-blind-salamander-tap-dancing-spider-fat-catfish
2/10/2022,"Two people in England have been diagnosed with Lassa fever, and a third “probable” case is under investigation, the UK Health Security Agency has said. It is the first time cases of the potentially deadly infectious disease, caused by the Lassa virus, have been identified in the UK for more than a decade.  One of the two confirmed cases has recovered, and the second is receiving specialist care at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. The “probable” case is being treated at Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS foundation trust, UKHSA said. The cases are understood to be within the same family in the east of England and are linked to recent travel to west Africa. Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness. People usually become infected with Lassa virus through exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of infected rats. The virus can also be spread through bodily fluids. People living in areas of west Africa with high populations of rodents where the disease is endemic are most at risk of Lassa fever. Imported cases rarely occur elsewhere in the world. Such cases are almost exclusively in people who work in endemic areas in high-risk occupations such as medicine, or other aid workers. Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: “We can confirm that two cases of Lassa fever have been identified in England, and a further probable case is under investigation. The cases are within the same family and are linked to recent travel to West Africa. “Cases of Lassa fever are rare in the UK and it does not spread easily between people. The overall risk to the public is very low. We are contacting the individuals who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to provide appropriate assessment, support and advice. The UKHSA and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be reinforced.” Most people with Lassa fever will make a full recovery. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals. The Guardian understands that the UK’s High Consequence Infectious Disease Network is already engaged with the treatment of the infected individuals. Symptoms are usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness and malaise. After a few days there may be headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain , according to the World Health Organization. In severe cases there may be facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure. Deafness occurs in 25% of recovered patients. In half of these cases, hearing returns partially after one to three months. Before these cases, there had been just eight cases of Lassa fever imported to the UK since 1980. The last two cases occurred in 2009. There was no evidence of onward transmission from any of these cases. Dr Sir Michael Jacobs, a consultant in infectious diseases at the Royal Free London, said: “The Royal Free hospital is a specialist centre for treating patients with viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever. Our secure unit is run by a highly trained and experienced team of doctors, nurses, therapists and laboratory staff and is designed to ensure our staff can safely treat patients with these kind of infections.”",News/UK news,Two people in England diagnosed with Lassa fever,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/two-people-in-england-diagnosed-with-lassa-fever
2/10/2022,"My colleague and friend James Hodsdon, who has died aged 74, spent his working life at GCHQ in Cheltenham and, after retiring in 2009, devoted himself to his passion for the history of the people and places of Gloucestershire, especially Cheltenham and its surroundings. James was born in Stratford-upon-Avon but grew up in Purley, Surrey, with his parents, Dennis Hodsdon, a trade union official, and Rosalind (nee Lowe), and his younger sister, Joan. He attended Wallington county grammar school and, after studying at Soas University of London and the University of St Andrews, with a doctorate in Arabic in 1972, he went to GCHQ, where he remained for 40 years, taking on occasional brief postings abroad.  His historical research resulted in two outstanding contributions to the Gloucestershire Record Series (of which he was general editor, 2010-20): a historical gazetteer of Cheltenham, and an edition of Cheltenham manor court books. He wrote the Dictionary of National Biography’s entries on Joseph Pitt and Sir Christopher Hoddesdon (a distant relation), produced meticulously researched articles on interesting local subjects, such as the contribution of Captain Henry Skillicorne to the development of Cheltenham as a spa, and was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 2018. It was, however, the inspiration that his friendship and encouragement brought to fellow enthusiasts for which he will be best remembered. As trustee or officer he served on practically every local organisation involved in historical studies, including as a modernising chair of council of the Bristol & Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, spearheading plans to celebrate its 150th anniversary. Very largely through his efforts, the Victoria County History, that venerable project to write the history of every English parish, remains active in Gloucestershire. When academic funding ended with a volume half-finished, James was instrumental in setting up a charitable trust which continues the task, and with which I am involved. His vision and drive led to three more volumes nearing completion (including on Cheltenham, of course), which were researched by younger academics and a stalwart group of volunteers. James was a delightful man to work for and with, the ideal blend of quiet diplomacy, sly humour and irresistible charm – all backed up by determination, wisdom and sincerity. He employed these qualities locally to the full, but also bestowed them on organisations at national level. He died of heart failure while doing volunteer gardening in Pittville Park in Cheltenham, about which he had written extensively. In 1969 James married Judie Bonsall, and both rose to senior positions at GCHQ. She and their three children, Amelia, Alice and Nicholas, and three grandchildren, survive him.",News/Education,James Hodsdon obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/09/james-hodsdon-obituary
2/10/2022,"Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad are insisting their omission from England’s squad to tour West Indies next month is “not the end of the road” and are focused on forcing their way back into the Test side, according to Andrew Strauss. “I’m not going to say anything other than they were disappointed and I wouldn’t expect anything otherwise,” Strauss, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s interim managing director of men’s cricket, said of their reactions when he delivered the news to them before the squad was announced on Tuesday.  “They take great pride in representing England and they both wanted to be on that tour. There was no impression from either of them that they saw this as the end of the road. I fully expect them to prepare themselves for the summer and put their names in the frame for selection. “They were very hard conversations. All I can say is I hope they understood the thinking behind it and what we’re trying to achieve here, and also that they got the message very strongly that this isn’t the end for them, because we want them fired up and ready to go in the summer. “We know there’s going to be a lot of interest in the decision, but we feel like we’re doing it for the right reasons and this is going to help the England team to develop at a time when it really needs to develop quickly.” Anderson said he had “no intention of finishing” after the recent Ashes series and that after conversations with the captain, Joe Root, and other senior players “the message is to keep going”. Last year Broad said he did not expect the team to be rebuilt after the Ashes “because it’s not an ageing team that needs rebuilding. This is a youngish team who need a bit of time and I see myself as a big part of our aim to become the best Test team in the world.” Broad and Anderson are England’s two most successful bowlers of all time, with a combined 1,177 Test wickets. But Strauss said the three-man selection committee for the West Indies tour – also including James Taylor and Paul Collingwood, the interim head coach after the dismissal of Chris Silverwood – decided “it would be remiss of us” not to take the opportunity to omit the bowlers as they try “to give the new director of cricket and coach options to choose from”. “We felt strategically it was an opportunity for both of them to be left out,” he said. “We see it is a strategic decision. In the end there was clarity that this was an opportunity we needed to take and that is not saying one or both of them will not feature this summer. They’ve given everything to England over a long period of time. I just feel like this is a moment when we had an opportunity to start projecting forward.” A number of players have been placed on standby to join the tour in case of injury or illness, but Strauss confirmed that neither Anderson nor Broad is among them. Root will move up to third in the batting order at his own request (he averages 38.66 in 53 previous innings at No 3, and 51.27 in 106 innings at No 4), with Ben Stokes under consideration to be promoted to four. Alex Lees, the uncapped 28-year-old Durham batter, will open with Zak Crawley. Strauss also confirmed that Jos Buttler had been available for selection, but that Ben Foakes is considered the first-choice wicketkeeper. “Joe Root is very keen to bat 3 going forward, and that allows us to potentially tackle that top-order problem which has been a thorn in our side for a long time,” Strauss said. “With Joe moving up there’s going to be a little bit of a rejig in that batting lineup.” Strauss said Ollie Robinson, whose fitness was criticised by the bowling coach, Jon Lewis, during the tour of Australia, was working hard to improve his stamina. “His conditioning currently is not what it needs to be and I think he is beginning to understand how hard international cricket is, because you can’t operate at a level that is not 100%,” Strauss said. “He is working very hard at the moment to get that conditioning up.” Lewis will continue as bowling coach in West Indies, with Marcus Trescothick, Jeetan Patel and Carl Hopkinson also in the coaching team.",Sport/Sport,Strauss: dropping Broad and Anderson for England is a ‘strategic decision’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/09/axing-stuart-broad-and-jimmy-anderson-a-strategic-decision-says-england-andrew-strauss
2/10/2022,"Boris Johnson has announced plans to abolish the legal requirement for people in England to self-isolate, even if they test positive for the coronavirus and have symptoms. The move, planned for later this month, would represent “an important step for this country as we move out of the pandemic”, said the prime minister’s spokesperson. “It shows that the hard work of the British people is paying off.”  Throughout the pandemic, the UK government has often forged its own path out of step with its neighbours. Is Johnson’s latest move continuing England’s outlier position? In a way, yes. Many other countries plan to continue to enforce self-isolation and quarantine with penalties and fines. Still, England joins other European countries that are easing Covid-19 restrictions as infection rates drop and Omicron is shown to be less severe compared to previous variants. On Wednesday, the Czech Republic said people no longer have to show a vaccination certificate to enter bars, restaurants and cafes. And while the World Health Organization suggests that people who test positive should isolate for 14 days, many governments have cut isolation periods. Countries such as Germany and France have a 10-day isolation period in place, although in France, that can be reduced to five days with a negative test. Russia’s isolation period is now seven days. The UK recently cut the minimum time people with Covid in England have to spend in self-isolation to five days. In the US, health officials have also halved the isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid from 10 to five days. Denmark appears to have some of the most relaxed isolation rules at present, with people allowed to leave the house four days after they test positive, providing they no longer have symptoms. The change in England will be a technical legal issue. Under the proposed rules, Covid will be treated in a similar way to flu, with guidance to stay at home but no penalties for going to shops, work or school. In several countries, including Sweden, isolation has been largely treated this way throughout the pandemic – as guidance and recommendations rather than law.",News/World news,Is England an outlier in abandoning Covid isolation rule?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/is-england-outlier-in-abandoning-covid-isolations-rules
2/10/2022,"My friend and colleague Allan Hamilton, who has died of pneumonia aged 85, was a distinguished microbiologist at the University of Aberdeen. His work transformed the understanding of microbial corrosion in offshore oil installations and helped to solve it. He was born in Glasgow to Vernon Hamilton, an accountant with Glasgow Corporation Tramways, and Jean (nee Hood), who worked at Pettigrew’s store in the city. He attended Hutchesons’ grammar school and studied biochemistry at the University of Glasgow, graduating in 1958. He completed a PhD in 1961 and went to work for Unilever in Bedfordshire, investigating the safety of food and hygiene products.  In 1969 Allan became a senior lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, where he researched energy transduction in bacteria. After uncovering new insights into how microbes corrode oil rigs, he and colleagues formed a company, Micran, providing mitigating services to the oil industry. In 1978 Allan established the department of microbiology at Aberdeen, becoming the first holder of its chair of microbiology. He selected and nurtured talented colleagues, taking pride in their attainments. Throughout his leadership the department was consistently one of the most highly ranked research units in the UK. Allan was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1980. Recognising the importance of bacteria to emerging biotechnologies, he orchestrated the rejuvenation of the National Collection for Industrial Bacteria, which had stored types of organisms for research and had been neglected and underfunded. He became its chairman in 1982 and steered its development until 1997. His vision not only ensured the survival of a national resource but saw it develop through the next generation of technologies to provide a range of important services. Allan married Evie Stewart in 1992. After his retirement in 1994, he and Evie moved to Ardrishaig, where he became a director of the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses (2004-09) and of the Kilmartin Museum (2015-17). Allan was also treasurer of the Microbiology Society. Allan had wide interests, including sailing, the arts, music, fine wine, whisky and fly fishing. He ably played the bagpipes at many a Burns night. He was great company and a wonderful host at home and on his boat. He is survived by Evie, and his stepdaughters, Marsali and Toto, and step-grandchildren Arty, Cora, Tala, Ruban and Hani.",News/Science,Allan Hamilton obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/09/allan-hamilton-obituary
