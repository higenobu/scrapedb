5/3/2022,"A Missouri man has been found guilty of beating his pregnant wife to death following an argument about his extramarital affairs. Beau Rothwell, 31, was found guilty on Thursday for the killing of Jennifer Rothwell, 28, according to a statement from the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney. During the three-day trial, Rothwell admitted in court that he hit Jennifer once in the head with a mallet while in a “red haze” at their Creve Couer, Missouri, home on Nov. 11, 2019. Rothwell claimed he hit her a second time when she tried to flee, something the prosecution said was an admission that the attack was deliberate. “In the heat of everything, I hit her again,” Rothwell testified, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “I believe I cracked her skull, she fell unconscious, and fell down the stairs.” Rothwell’s account, however, was challenged in court. “The Medical Examiner’s conclusions and other physical evidence, however, did not support Rothwell’s narrative,” according to the statement. “The Medical Examiner testified that the fatal wound to the right side of the victim’s head was the result of a single blow with a weapon much sturdier than a mallet, such as a baseball bat.” As previously reported, Beau Rothwell was arrested for tampering with evidence on Nov. 14, 2019 – while his wife was still missing – when surveillance camera captured him buying bleach, carpet cleaner, and gloves on the day of the murder. Authorities also found “evidence of the crime of murder” at the couple’s home, where the carpets were soaked with bleach. While in custody, the suspect directed investigators toward a wooded area off a highway where they found Jennifer’s naked body on Nov. 18, 2019, resulting in murder charges. According to the Post-Dispatch, Rothwell wrapped his wife’s head in a plastic bag and secured it with duct tape before trying to conceal her in the brush near Troy, Missouri, about one hour north of the couple’s home. The victim was six weeks pregnant. Rothwell confessed to abandoning her car so that people would assume she ran into car trouble on her way to work and sent text messages to her phone to appear concerned about her disappearance. Rothwell went as far as to make a Facebook post, which has since been taken down, appealing for information about his missing wife. During the trial, Rothwell testified that he and his wife began arguing when he refused to reveal the identity of his paramour, whom Jennifer allegedly referred to as his “mystery bitch,” according to the Post-Dispatch. He also accused the victim of carrying another man’s child, which proved to be false when a postmortem paternity test identified Rothwell as the father. It was revealed during the investigation that Jennifer used her phone to look up “what to do if your husband is upset you are pregnant” shortly before the murder, “In his notebook, he listed pros and cons that showed he was deliberating whether to leave his pregnant wife for another woman, but worried that ‘the cost was too high,’” stated the prosecuting attorney’s office. “In a Facebook message to the other woman, he listed three options: break it off with her, divorce his pregnant wife, or wait and hope for a ‘miscarriage or something.’” “The State argued that Rothwell finally decided that ‘something’ would be to kill his pregnant wife and then stage it as a disappearance.” Rothwell’s defense denied the state’s claims of premeditation, hoping the jury would convict the defendant on charges of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder in the first degree. “The state is trying to turn this extramarital affair into some sort of motive or deliberation,” said defense attorney Charles Barberio. “There simply isn’t any evidence that he ever planned to do it.” Prosecutors also challenged Rothwell’s claims that he initially struck his wife near the upstairs dinner table before she “rolled down the basement steps” following the second blow. They said all of the victim’s blood – which the defendant tried and failed to conceal – was found at the bottom of the basement steps, indicating he “ambushed the victim.” A St. Louis County jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree, tampering with physical evidence in a felony prosecution, and abandonment of a corpse. “This is why we do this job,” said Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell. “When we are able to bring justice to a family that has lost a loved one and lost her in such a brutal manner, there is no better feeling in the world. Hopefully, Jennifer can rest in peace, and her family can finally get closure. Justice was served.” Rothwell is scheduled for sentencing on July 8.",U.S./Oxygen,Man Found Guilty Of Pregnant Wife's Beating Death After Argument Over His Extramarital Affairs,https://news.yahoo.com/man-found-guilty-pregnant-wifes-170902537.html

5/3/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine — The British military says it believes the Russian military is now “significantly weaker” after suffering losses in its war on Ukraine. The British Defense Ministry made the comment Tuesday in its daily statement on Twitter regarding the war. It said: “Russia’s military is now significantly weaker, both materially and conceptually, as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. Recovery from this will be exacerbated by sanctions. This will have a lasting impact on Russia’s ability to deploy conventional military force.” The ministry added while Russia’s defense budget has doubled from 2005 to 2018, the modernization program it undertook “has not enabled Russia to dominate Ukraine.” “Failures both in strategic planning and operational execution have left it unable to translate numerical strength into decisive advantage,"" the ministry said. ___ KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: — US official says Russia plans to annex parts of eastern Ukraine — Civilians rescued from Mariupol steel plant head for safety — Push to arm Ukraine putting strain on US weapons stockpile — UEFA removes more Russian soccer teams from its competitions Follow all AP stories on Russia’s war on Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: LVIV, Ukraine — Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show nearly 50 Russian military helicopters at a base close to the Ukrainian border. The image captured Monday by Planet Labs PBC shows the helicopters in Stary Oskol, Russia, some 175 kilometers (110 miles) northeast of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. The helicopters are stationed on the tarmac, runway and grass of the otherwise civilian airport. Military equipment is stationed nearby to support the aircraft. Russia has been using its military attack helicopters in its war on Ukraine, flying low to the ground to try to avoid anti-aircraft missiles. Meanwhile, another satellite image showed a bridge repeatedly targeted by Moscow near the Black Sea port city of Odesa still standing as of around noon Monday. That strategic bridge connects Odesa to the wider countryside and would be key to defending the area. A breakaway region of neighboring Moldova home to Russian troops nearby has seen a series of mysterious explosions in recent days, raising concerns about the conflict widening. ___ ROME — Pope Francis has told an Italian newspaper that he offered to travel to Moscow to meet the Russian president about three weeks into the invasion, but that he has not received a response. Francis was quoted Tuesday by Corriere della Sera as saying his offer to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow was made through the Vatican’s No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, 20 days into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said, “Of course, it would be necessary for the leader of the Kremlin to make available some window of opportunity. But we still have not had a response and we are still pushing, even if I fear that Putin cannot and does not want to have this meeting at this moment.” Francis said he spoke with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, for 40 minutes by videoconference and for the first half “with paper in hand, he read all of the justifications for the war. I listened and told him: I don’t understand any of this. Brother, we are not clerics of the state, we cannot use language of politics, but that of Jesus. … For this we need to find the paths of peace, to stop the firing of arms.” ___ OTTAWA — Ukraine’s ambassador-designate to Canada says Russia must be held accountable for its troops committing sex crimes, including against children. Yulia Kovaliv told a Canadian House of Commons committee Monday that Russia is using sexual violence as a weapon of war and said rape and sexual assault must be investigated as war crimes. She said Russia also has kidnapped Ukrainian children and taken them to Russian-occupied territories and now Russia itself. Ukraine is working with partners to find the children and bring them back. “Russians, a few days ago, killed a young mother and taped her living child to her body and attached a mine between them,″ the ambassador said. She said the mine detonated. All of Russian society, and not just President Vladimir Putin “and his proxies,” should bear responsibility for the war on Ukraine because more than 70% of Russians support the invasion, Kovaliv said. ___ WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived Monday at the Capitol after leading a surprise delegation trip to Ukraine, vowing the U.S. Congress has “more to do” to help the country fight the Russian invasion. Pelosi is the highest-ranking elected U.S. official to touch down in Kyiv since the start of the war and she called the congressional delegation’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “informative and it was inspiring.” The trip with Democratic lawmakers comes as Congress is preparing a $33 billion package of military and humanitarian aid, but now some lawmakers also are discussing a “Marshall Plan”-type effort to eventually help rebuild Ukraine as the U.S. aided Europe after World War II. Pelosi returned to the Capitol in Washington to sign and send President Joe Biden legislation passed last week by Congress that would update a World War II-era military lend-lease law and streamline the process for sending aid to Ukraine.

5/3/2022,"STORY: Germany said on Monday it was prepared to back an immediate EU embargo on Russian oil, a major shift by Germany -- that analysts say would tip its economy into recession. The EU is expected to propose a sixth round of sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine this week- and the oil embargo is possibly on the menu. Russia supplies 40% of EU gas and 26% of its oil imports and Germany is its biggest energy customer. However, Economy Minister Robert Habeck said earlier Monday his country was ready. ""Germany is not against an oil ban on Russia. Of course, it is a heavy load to bear, but we would be ready to do that."" Also on Monday, the EU warned that complying in full with Moscow's demand that countries effectively pay for gas in roubles, or face losing their supply... would breach existing EU sanctions. ""The (European Union) member states and the companies should not have any illusions that they can rely on the good faith of Gazprom and the Russian regime in this matter."" Weaning Europe off Russian oil is likely to be easier than reducing dependence on Russian natural gas. Russia cut gas supply to Bulgaria and Poland last week for refusing to comply and many others in the 27-nation bloc face deadlines this month. Late Monday, Ukrainian leader Volodomyr Zelenskiy's used his nightly video to argue that buying Russian energy fuels Moscow’s war effort. ""We are working on new sanctions against Russia. We expect a new package from the European Union in the near future. This package should include clear steps to block Russia's energy revenues. We truly believe in this. So that the terrorist state is not given a billion euros a day for fuel."" Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and its western allies call that a baseless pretext for a war of aggression. Ambassadors from EU countries will discuss the proposed oil sanctions when they meet on Wednesday.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Germany will back EU oil embargo on Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/germany-back-eu-oil-embargo-070711368.html
