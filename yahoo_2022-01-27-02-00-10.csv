1/27/2022,"A plow operator in Ohio was caught on camera launching snow and ice over a highway median Sunday. The slushy mess damaged approximately 40 vehicles and caused some personal injuries. The turnpike commission immediately placed the driver on administrative leave, pending investigation. Ohio's Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission has suspended a snowplow operator after the driver directed snow and ice over the highway median and into oncoming traffic on Sunday. The incident spread across several miles, causing accidents involving roughly 40 vehicles and injuring 12 people, law enforcement officials told local media. Video from truck driver Michael Lemon shows passenger cars traveling down an otherwise gray and dreary road scene when an arc of slush suddenly emerges, blanketing everything with a thud and causing one vehicle to spin off of the embankment. Ferzan Ahmed, executive director of the Turnpike Commission, said in a statement that the plow driver was immediately taken off the shift, tested for drugs and alcohol, and placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into the incident. Ahmed also said that Turnpike Commission employees have special training and equipment for clearing snow and ice, and the highway has one of the best safety records in the nation. The commission is a private entity, separate from the Ohio Department of Transportation. ""This was an isolated incident involving a single operator and is not representative of our employees or our operations,"" Ahmed said. The incident is certainly unusual for a profession that requires a commercial drivers' license and additional training, but transportation officials have raised concerns about having enough drivers to operate safely. Back in December, transportation officials in Washington, Montana, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania told the Associated Press they were facing an ongoing shortfall of licensed and trained snowplow drivers this winter. ""When you're plowing the road you need to know where the bridge abutment is and where the expansion joints are so you don't hook that with a plow,"" Washington state's Department of Transportation spokesperson Barbara LaBoe said. Meanwhile, some towns in Massachusetts resorted to offering wages up to $310 per hour, while Colorado's Department of Transportation added a $2,000 snow bonus for road-maintenance-workers.

1/27/2022,"Clashes broke out at Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, in Kyiv on Tuesday, January 25, as crowds rallied in favor of protections for small businesses. Police said 18 officers and 3 protesters were injured as a number of demonstrators tried to break through police lines and enter the Verkhovna Rada, prompting officers to push back. Sixty-three people were detained, police said. The protest was organized by SaveFOP, an organization that “argues planned tax reforms would hurt small businesses,” according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the US-funded news organization that shot this footage. FOP is an abbreviation of the Ukrainian term for an individual entrepreneur, and is akin to “sole proprietorship” in the United States or “sole trader” in the United Kingdom, according to Ukrainian legal professionals. Additionally, Kyiv police released security-camera video to dispel rumors that one demonstrator had died, after SaveFOP organizers posted two videos on Facebook showing a man receiving medical care on a street and wrote that he was “allegedly murdered and taken away by police.” In response, police said: “This information is untrue and refuted after watching CCTV cameras. The man, who lost consciousness, was given first aid by police and the National Guard, after which he and a friend left the scene on their own.” Demonstrators returned to the Verkhovna Rada, on Wednesday, though in smaller numbers and with no reports of violence.

1/27/2022,"A teenage girl has been arrested for murder following a botched hostage scheme which began on Snapchat and wound up with the hostage’s brother being shot dead, according to authorities. Anna Bella Dukes, 18, was taken into custody on Monday for the murder of 24-year-old Elias Otero in New Mexico back on 11 February 2021, Albuquerque Police Department confirmed on social media. Ms Dukes and her 17-year-old boyfriend Adrian Avila had been wanted by police on suspicion of murder, kidnapping, two counts of armed robbery, tampering with evidence and conspiracy and were charged in their absence in December, according to a December press release from the police department. Ms Dukes is accused of using Snapchat to lure Elias Otero’s older brother Nicholas Otero to meet with her in person at Alvarado Park in the early hours of 11 February as part of a plot to ambush and rob him. Once there, Mr Avila and a third unidentified suspect allegedly robbed him at gunpoint. Police said Nicholas Otero was dragged from his red Lexus while the suspects demanded he handed over cash, jewellery and a gun. The suspects then allegedly took him hostage and drove him in his car and another vehicle to Nicholas Otero’s home, where they held him at gunpoint and ordered him to call his brother to ask for a ransom. Police said the hostage-takers threatened to shoot and kill Nicholas Otero if his brother didn’t comply with their demands and bring them money and a gun. Elias Otero came out of the house and threatened to shoot the suspects, according to police. At this point, Mr Avila allegedly opened fire on Elias Otero, shooting him dead in the street before all three suspects fled the scene. The 17-year-old suspected shooter surrendered to authorities in late December before Ms Dukes turned herself in on Monday, reported KOB4. The third suspect, who has not been named, is still on the run. The victim’s mother Alicia Otero said told the outlet that she was glad two of the alleged perpetrators were now in custody. “Every day we wish that we get justice and, you know, someone to pay for what they did to him and knowing they finally turned themselves in just - it feels good that it’s not gonna go unsolved,” she said. Investigators said that the vehicle the suspects used in the attack has also been linked to an earlier carjacking.",U.S./The Independent,New Mexico teen arrested for murder after botched Snapchat hostage scheme,https://news.yahoo.com/mexico-teen-arrested-murder-botched-142953340.html
1/27/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed Biden wants to defend Ukraine because of his son, Hunter. In an interview on Steve Bannon's ""War Room"", she claimed Ukraine has ""dirt"" on Hunter Biden. Biden, alongside NATO allies, have pledged defense to Ukraine in case of a Russian attack. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed Tuesday that President Joe Biden was backing Ukraine against Russia because Ukraine ""has dirt on Hunter Biden."" In an interview on Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast, Greene said Biden has been ""playing cover"" for his son Hunter, who has been at the center of baseless allegations of corruption over his business dealings with Ukraine. Greene told Bannon: ""I am blown away with what we're seeing. The president of the United States Joe Biden is willing to take our military to war ... against nuclear Russia because of Ukraine."" ""You cannot deny this, it's because Ukraine has the dirt on Hunter Biden. Ukraine has the dirt on Joe Biden, our president,"" she said, without giving further specifics. ""This is why we can have many of our troops get killed in this war that Joe Biden wants to have happened."" Biden has never threatened to go to war with Russia amid the growing military tensions with Ukraine. The US has, however, joined countries like Ukraine and the UK in warning of a Russian invasion, and called for a deescalation. Watch Greene's interview here. —Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) January 25, 2022 Russia has in recent weeks placed tens of thousands of troops and weaponry at Ukraine's border, but repeatedly denies plans to invade the country. Earlier this week the Pentagon said the US was placing 8,500 troops on ""heightened alert"" so they are prepared to respond to an invasion. No final decisions to deploy US forces have been made, however. Last month Biden threatened to impose heavy sanctions on Russia if it invaded Ukraine, and on Tuesday, said he would consider slapping Russian President Vladimir Putin with personal sanctions. Biden also said that a Russia attack would be the ""largest invasion since World War II.""

1/27/2022,"Scientists and health officials around the world are keeping their eyes on a descendant of the omicron variant that has been found in at least 40 countries, including the United States. This version of the coronavirus, which scientists call BA.2, is widely considered stealthier than the original version of omicron because particular genetic traits make it somewhat harder to detect. Some scientists worry it could also be more contagious. But they say there's a lot they still don't know about it, including whether it evades vaccines better or causes more severe disease. Since mid-November, more than three dozen countries have uploaded nearly 15,000 genetic sequences of BA.2 to GISAID, a global platform for sharing coronavirus data. As of Tuesday morning, 96 of those sequenced cases came from the U.S. ""Thus far, we haven't seen it start to gain ground"" in the U.S., said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas, which has identified three cases of BA.2. The mutant appears much more common in Asia and Europe. In Denmark, it made up 45% of all COVID-19 cases in mid-January, up from 20% two weeks earlier, according to Statens Serum Institut, which falls under the Danish Ministry of Health. BA.2 has lots of mutations. About 20 of them in the spike protein that studs the outside of the virus are shared with the original omicron. But it also has additional genetic changes not seen in the initial version. It's unclear how significant those mutations are, especially in a population that has encountered the original omicron, said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. For now, the original version, known as BA.1, and BA.2 are considered subsets of omicron. But global health leaders could give it its own Greek letter name if it is deemed a globally significant ""variant of concern."" The quick spread of BA.2 in some places raises concerns it could take off. ""We have some indications that it just may be as contagious or perhaps slightly more contagious than (original) omicron since it's able to compete with it in some areas,"" Long said. ""But we don't necessarily know why that is."" An initial analysis by scientists in Denmark shows no differences in hospitalizations for BA.2 compared with the original omicron. Scientists there are still looking into this version's infectiousness and how well current vaccines work against it. It's also unclear how well treatments will work against it. Doctors also don't yet know for sure if someone who's already had COVID-19 caused by omicron can be sickened again by BA.2. But they're hopeful, especially that a prior omicron infection might lessen the severity of disease if someone later contracts BA.2. The two versions of omicron have enough in common that it's possible that infection with the original mutant ""will give you cross-protection against BA.2,"" said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, an infectious diseases expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Scientists will be conducting tests to see if antibodies from an infection with the original omicron ""are able to neutralize BA.2 in the laboratory and then extrapolate from there,"" he said. The World Health Organization classifies omicron overall as a variant of concern, its most serious designation of a coronavirus mutant, but it doesn't single out BA.2 with a designation of its own. Given its rise in some countries, however, the agency says investigations of BA.2 ""should be prioritized."" The UK Health Security Agency, meanwhile, has designated BA.2 a ""variant under investigation,"" citing the rising numbers found in the U.K. and internationally. Still, the original version of omicron remains dominant in the U.K. The original version of omicron had specific genetic features that allowed health officials to rapidly differentiate it from delta using a certain PCR test because of what's known as ""S gene target failure."" BA.2 doesn't have this same genetic quirk. So on the test, Long said, BA.2 looks like delta. ""It's not that the test doesn't detect it; it's just that it doesn't look like omicron,"" he said. ""Don't get the impression that 'stealth omicron' means we can't detect it. All of our PCR tests can still detect it."" Doctors advise the same precautions they have all along: Get vaccinated and follow public health guidance about wearing masks, avoiding crowds and staying home when you're sick. ""The vaccines are still providing good defense against severe disease, hospitalization and death,"" Long said. ""Even if you've had COVID 19 before — you've had a natural infection — the protection from the vaccine is still stronger, longer lasting and actually ... does well for people who've been previously infected."" The latest version is another reminder that the pandemic hasn't ended. ""We all wish that it was over,"" Long said, ""but until we get the world vaccinated, we're going to be at risk of having new variants emerge.""
