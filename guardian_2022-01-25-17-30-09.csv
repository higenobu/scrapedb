1/25/2022,"The government borrowed almost £17bn to balance its books last month – the fourth highest December total on record – as the public finances felt the impact of sharply rising inflation. Rising tax receipts were partly offset by a surge in interest payments on the £2tn national debt, swelled by the emergency measures to support the economy over the past two years.  Prompting a warning from the chancellor of the need to reduce government borrowing, debt interest payments rose to a six-month high of £8.1bn after the sharp rise in inflation. Repayments on some of the UK’s borrowing is linked to the cost of living. Despite the arrival of the Omicron variant, the Office for National Statistics said the UK’s budget deficit was £7.6bn lower at £16.8bn than in the same month a year earlier and came in below the £18.5bn expected by the City. Tax receipts in December rose by £6.2bn compared with a year earlier, including a rise in corporation tax, stamp duty, income tax, VAT and fuel duty receipts. Borrowing in the first nine months of the 2021-2 financial year stood at £146.8bn – down on the previous year but still the second highest on record. Analysts said the UK was currently on course to hit the £183bn borrowing forecast made by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility but might be blown off course next year by soaring debt payments. Rishi Sunak said: “We are supporting the British people as we recover from the pandemic through our plan for jobs and business grants, loans and tax reliefs. “Risks to the public finances, including from inflation, make it even more important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments. “Our fiscal rules mean we will reduce our debt burden while continuing to invest in the future of the UK.” Bethany Beckett, the UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “As it stands, cumulative borrowing in 2021-22 is still on track to hit the OBR’s forecast of £183bn. But we doubt that this will last: we expect RPI inflation to average 2.8 percentage points higher than the OBR’s forecast in 2022-23, which will push up total borrowing in 2022-23 to £105bn, well above the OBR’s forecast of £83bn.” Samuel Tombs, the UK analyst at Pantheon Macro, said despite rising debt payments Sunak still had scope to intervene to ease the cost of living crisis that will affect households from April.",News/Business,UK government borrows almost £17bn in December as inflation soars,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/uk-government-borrows-inflation-national-debt-december
1/25/2022,"Watford hope to finalise a deal on Tuesday for Roy Hodgson to come out of retirement and replace Claudio Ranieri as their manager. The 74-year-old former England manager is regarded by the club’s owner, Gino Pozzo, as the ideal candidate to oversee Watford’s attempt to avoid relegation.  Hodgson retired at the end of last season after a successful spell at Crystal Palace but is ready to return to work, subject to the discussion of final details on Tuesday morning. He would resume his status as the Premier League’s oldest-ever manager. Hodgson has a reputation for guiding troubled clubs to safety, having taken over a Palace team with no points from four matches in September 2017 and accepted the Fulham job in 2007 a few days after Christmas when the side had two Premier League wins. When Hodgson announced he was retiring he left the door slightly ajar for an opening such as Watford. “One never knows,” he said. “It is a dangerous thing to do when you still feel good about yourself to start making bold statements about retirement. I am certainly not leaving Crystal Palace with the idea of putting myself back on the market for another job. “I really am stepping away from football for a while, but who knows what the future will be? It is a never-say-never moment. I’ve seen so many people retire with all the fanfare blazing, only to surface again somewhere in a fairly short period of time. I’d prefer not to do that.” Ranieri was sacked on Monday after only 16 weeks at Watford, during which he won two of 13 league games. The club are without a victory in nine games in all competitions, their longest such run since December 2013, and are 19th but only two points from safety. Their next game is at the bottom club, Burnley, on 5 February.",Sport/Football,Watford in advanced talks to make Roy Hodgson their new manager,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/watford-roy-hodgson-new-manager
1/25/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of predominantly older people and those living in rural areas will be forced to upgrade their mobile phones by the end of 2023, as Vodafone sets a deadline for switching off its ageing 3G network next year with a promise that “no one will be left behind”. Vodafone, which has about 18 million UK mobile customers, is to turn off the almost two-decade-old network as usage dwindles to focus on using the freed up spectrum to expand its 4G and 5G networks.  However, the company, which is to phase out 3G along the same timeline as EE-owner BT, admits that there are hundreds of thousands of customers who have stuck with their 3G-only phones, particularly older owners who have not been enticed to join the smartphone revolution. In addition, areas of the UK including parts of Cornwall, rural Scotland and north Norfolk still only have 3G coverage, in total about 2.2% of the UK, although there is voice call capability in these areas thanks to a 2G signal. “We start communicating to customers about this today,” said Ahmed Essam, chief executive of Vodafone UK. “Our goal is for everyone to stay connected, and we will be doing everything we can to make sure that is the case.” Vodafone, which is launching an awareness campaign to make sure no customers are left in the equivalent of the digital dark when the 3G signal is switched off next year, estimates that well over 2 million people are still using 3G handsets across all of the UK’s mobile networks. The company intends to encourage tech-savvy younger smartphone users to “check in” with family and friends to see if they may need to upgrade their phone. “There are people who aren’t confident with technology,” said Essam. “We want to ensure that everyone is getting the help that they need, so no one is left behind.” A year-long communications campaign includes partnering with organisations including the Good Things Foundation, which aims to achieve digital inclusion across all socio-economic groups, with an announcement on a partner specifically focused on older demographics expected in the coming weeks. “With the move away from 3G, people risk being disconnected, locked out and left behind,” said Helen Milner, group chief executive at Good Things Foundation. Vodafone, which launched its 3G network in the UK in November 2004, said that today less than 4% of data used by customers is carried on the network. As recently as 2016, the 3G network carried 30% of data. “3G has connected so many customers over the last 17 years, but the future is 4G and 5G,” said Essam. Vodafone, which has already switched off 3G networks in Germany and Italy, said that in the long run the switch-off of 3G will benefit the environment as it is built with what is now considered inefficient equipment, with 5G networks 10 times more efficient. Last summer, BT became the first operator to announce it will phase out its 3G network in a staged approach with full switch-off completed by the end of next year. The UK’s other two leading mobile operators, Three and Virgin Media O2, have not announced any plans to switch off their 3G services. Three UK’s parent company, Hutchison, paid £4.4bn for the UK’s first 3G licence in 2000 and launched the first network in March 2003.",News/Technology,Vodafone to switch off UK 3G network by end of 2023,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/25/vodafone-to-switch-off-uk-3g-network-by-end-of-2023
1/25/2022,"At the beginning of our relationship my husband was not faithful. He had secret affairs and flirtations that I was suspicious about, but if I brought it up, I was called crazy and accused of sabotaging our relationship. It wasn’t until our first child was born, after four years of marriage, that he felt extreme guilt and remained faithful. Shortly after baby number two was born three years later, he told me that he was polyamorous and has a crush at work. There are times when he emotionally pulls away and this is when I think he desires more than just me. When I told him I was ready to break up, he claimed he would do anything not to lose me. We started dating again but, after two weeks, he asked me to consider having a threesome. I feel I have reached a point where I am ready to settle down and that is why I married him. But it appears to me that he does not feel the same way. I cannot understand why – if he loves me like he says he does – I am not enough? Some people find monogamy impossible. They are just wired that way. In fact, monogamy is difficult for most people. I understand that trust is very important to you, yet right from the beginning you knew your husband was rarely just with you. You have stayed with him and had children, and there is clearly deep love between you so I am wondering why have you now reached a point where his non-monogamous lifestyle is insufferable? In reality, he is not going to change. Your choices are to separate, or stay with him and make the most of what is good between you – despite the torture. You would do well to consider what it is about you that binds you to this constant state of disappointment and longing. After you understand that, you may make the healthier choice.

1/25/2022,"In late March 1948, the King Cole Trio released their second 78rpm single of the year. Already well known for crossover pop smashes such as (I Love You) for Sentimental Reasons, the trio were taking a flyer on something different for their next release. Initially buried on a B-side, Nature Boy was unlike anything else that they – or anyone else – had recorded. Cole sings the dreamy opening lyrics – “There was a boy / A very strange, enchanted boy” – with warm intimacy; the song ends with an eternal message: “The greatest thing you’ll ever learn / Is just to love and be loved in return.” The sides flipped, Nature Boy stayed at the top of the US pop charts for eight weeks in the spring of 1948, at a time of rapidly increasing tension: the start of the cold war and the anti-communist purge. For such a gentle, pacifistic song to have become the bestselling single of the year speaks to a sense of inchoate longing in the US at that time, barely three years after the second world war.  After Nature Boy became a hit, in an appearance on the CBS show We the People, Cole finally met the man who had written his song, the year’s bestseller. In archive clips of the episode, eden ahbez (the lower case was preferred) has hair down to his shoulders and wears loose-fitting clothes; his style is nearly two decades ahead of his time. Reading from prepared scripts, these two outliers – a proto-hippy and an early African American crossover artist – tell the story of how Cole discovered the song, after it was delivered on spec to the Los Angeles theatre where he was performing. To the incredulity of the host, ahbez announces that he has “not much use for money”. It’s no small irony that this devotee of simple living – albeit with an entrepreneurial side – is being presented on a talkshow on a major US network, produced by Life magazine and sponsored by Gulf Oil. As ahbez rides on to the stage on his bicycle and then assumes a yoga position, he makes it clear that he will not conform to the values of corporate America: in his sheer strangeness, he is a harbinger of things to come. Nature Boy has gone on to become a 20th-century classic, with numerous cover versions recorded by artists as diverse as Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Mantovani, Grace Slick, Nick Cave, Frank Sinatra and David Bowie. It is one of those songs that transcends time and space: not just because of the sentiment, or the seductive swoon of Cole’s original, but also because of ahbez, who tapped into the deep longings that have always lain underneath the surface of mass culture. ahbez was born George Alexander Aberle in mid-April 1908, to a poor Brooklyn family. After his mother died, he was placed in an orphanage before being fostered, at the age of nine, by a family in Kansas. There is scant information about his teenage years, but during the Great Depression he hoboed his way around the midwest, working as an itinerant musician. Towards the end of the 1930s, he moved to Miami, where he learned about meditation and a healthy diet. It was at this time that he wrote an early version of Nature Boy. Moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1940s, Aberle became ahbez. He fell in with a group of nature mystics that included John and Vera Richter, the owners of the Eutropheon, a vegetarian cafe on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Like the long-haired “hermit turned showman” William Pester – whom it is thought ahbez met in the late 1930s – the Richters were adherents of lebensreform (life reform), a philosophy that had begun in Switzerland and Germany in the first decade of the 20th century. Coexisting with the early Wandervogel – or wandering birds, the young, usually male, hikers who advocated a return to nature – lebensreform pioneers congregated in communities, foreswore private property, and practised vegetarianism and organic farming, in an attempt to counter the toxins of mechanised contemporary life. Visitors included Hermann Hesse, Carl Jung, Paul Klee, Rudolf Steiner and Hugo Ball. This was one seedbed for an alternative lifestyle that would flourish during the next 50 years. ahbez was directly influenced by Pester – thought to be the inspiration for Nature Boy – and came into contact with these ideas at the Eutropheon, where he worked. Nature Boy was the conduit through which vegetarian ideals, nonconformism and notions of living in harmony with nature began to filter into US culture. True to his beliefs, ahbez continued to live rough even after the song had earned him generous royalties; he camped for a short period under the then Hollywood sign. The first strands of ahbez’s influence can be seen in the mid-1950s exotica boom: the musical genre popularised by Martin Denny and Les Baxter that evoked escapist dreams. In 1960, ahbez released his only solo album, Eden’s Island, which gently evokes a Pacific Island with the sounds of surf and wind, gulls, soothing flutes and hypnotic sprechgesang. That year, he also recorded a song called Surf Rider, placing him at the start of the surf boom that began in 1961 with records by Dick Dale, the Bel-Airs and the Beach Boys. In 1963, he came up with a paean to the jazz festival at Monterey – featuring John Harris on vocals and the jazz great Paul Horn on flute – which namechecks Miles Davis and celebrates the place where “the hippies play”. ahbez finally found himself in tune with his time, as the early hippies around him began to assume the values he had held for 25 years. In 1966, Grace Slick played a version of Nature Boy with her first group, the Great Society; their echoey live recording – dominated by a flute that echoes ahbez’s favoured, handmade instrument – was the first time I ever heard the song. That year, ahbez was photographed in the studio with Brian Wilson, who was hitting new creative heights with Good Vibrations and the sessions for the Smile album: indeed, Beach Boys tunes such as Vegetables and the exotic instrumental Let’s Go Away for a While fit right into the ahbez aesthetic. Discouraged by the lack of success of his solo LP, and devastated by the death of his wife, Anna, in 1963, ahbez quit recording in the late 1960s, although hundreds of manuscripts of his songs were lodged at the Library of Congress. Even as he disappeared from popular culture, his influence persisted: in 1968, the Beatles released Mother Nature’s Son on the White Album; the song was written by Paul McCartney under the direct influence of Nat King Cole’s version of Nature Boy. ahbez died in Palm Springs in 1995 from injuries sustained in a car accident; he was 86. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in his work and life, with a reissue of Eden’s Island, and two excellent compilations of hard-to-find material: 2014’s The Exotic World of eden ahbez, and 2016’s Wild Boy: The Lost Songs. Compiled by film-maker and ahbez expert Brian Chidester, these albums range from exotica, offbeat rock’n’roll and surf to ahbez’s trademark beatific ambience. Chidester was also instrumental in producing the remarkable 2021 album Eden Ahbez’s Dharmaland, which showcased some of ahbez’s songs rescued from the Library of Congress and reinterpreted by the Swedish group Ìxtahuele. With a film of ahbez’s life, As the Wind: The Enchanted Life of Eden Ahbez, currently in production, this extraordinary time traveller seems finally set to get his due – well over 70 years after his most famous song introduced him and his beliefs to the world.

1/25/2022,"When it was announced in the first days of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, described the furlough scheme as “as one of the most significant economic interventions at any point in the history of the British state and by any government anywhere in the world”. Boris Johnson and Sunak were proud of a trailblazing scheme that would pay 80% of the wages of up to 11.7 million workers up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. “We have put aside ideology and orthodoxy to mobilise the full power and resources of the British state,” Sunak said from the 10 Downing Street lectern.  Furlough payments were just one of a number of schemes hastily introduced by the government in the early stages of the pandemic to support individuals and businesses financially. Others included the self-employed income support programme, “eat out to help out” – and the business Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS). In the House of Lords on Monday, Theodore Agnew, the minister responsible for Whitehall efficiency and counter-fraud, singled out lax oversight of the BBLS in his dramatic resignation speech. Lord Agnew criticised oversight of Covid loans by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the British Business Bank, a state lender, saying it had been “nothing less than woeful”. He added that Sunak’s department, the Treasury, appeared to have “no knowledge or little interest” in the consequences of fraud. The warning signs have long been visible, such as multiple companies being formed at the same address. And the first prosecutions have started trickling through. The government has long pointed to the wartime footing under which its support schemes were rolled out, and the urgent need to pump cash into the economy or risk the collapse of vast numbers of businesses. In a debate in the House of Commons earlier this month, John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, claimed the government has “taken the issue of potential fraud relating to Covid grant schemes extremely seriously”, but said “it would have been impossible to prevent all related fraud”. However, right from the start the Covid financial support announcements sparked concern at the headquarters of HM Revenue and Custom further down Whitehall. “From the beginning it was clear the schemes would be targets for fraud and that customers would make mistakes,” HMRC said last year as it wrote off £4.3bn stolen through the various Covid-19 emergency support schemes. HMRC believes that about £5.8bn – or £1 in every £14 of the £81.2bn paid out through the schemes – has been stolen. So far just £500m has been recovered, and it expects only another £800m-£1bn may be recovered by 2023. In March, the business department estimated that 37% of bounce back loans, worth £17bn, would not be repaid and that 11% came from fraudulent applications. A subsequent investigation by the accountancy firm PwC in October revised the fraud rate down to 7.5%, although the National Audit Office said in its December report that it had not had time to check this estimate itself. The NAO had long singled out the government’s “inadequate” attempts to tackle fraud within the £47bn BBLS scheme that was designed to try to help save companies at risk of collapse during the pandemic. It said anti-fraud checks for the scheme had been “implemented too slowly”, with limited verification and no credit checks on borrowers. As the scheme progressed 13 additional counter-fraud measures were introduced, but most came too late to prevent fraud and were focused instead on detection. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, has warned that the fraud already identified could be just the tip of the iceberg. “The true level of fraud will become clearer over time,” he said.",News/Business,Feeble oversight of UK’s Covid loan schemes was a gift to fraudsters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/feeble-oversight-of-uks-covid-loan-schemes-was-a-gift-to-fraudsters
1/25/2022,"The Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday have been banging on a lot lately about freedom of expression. An editorial declared it to be a “dark day” when the newspaper group lost its legal battle with Meghan Markle. She’d sued them for publishing extracts from a private letter she’d sent to her estranged father. I’ve got to know the Mail’s legal department quite well over the past few months – though its client’s commitment to freedom of expression hasn’t been quite so clear in my case. The Mail’s lawyers appear to be fixated with my play Bloody Difficult Women and have been bombarding the Riverside Studios theatre in west London and my producers with emails and letters. Paul Dacre, the Mail’s editor in chief, appears in it as a character, and the lawyers said Dacre would very much like to see a copy of the script to check it for factual accuracy. These repeated requests have all been declined.  The play focuses on the court case my old friend Gina Miller won against Theresa May’s government over the issue of parliamentary sovereignty. Dacre is an unavoidable part of that story: the “Enemies of the people” headline he ran on his paper’s front page, alongside photographs of the high court judges who found in Miller’s favour, caused uproar. There were a great many – not least in the legal profession – who took the view it was the lowest point in the whole acrimonious Brexit saga. Apart from Dacre and Miller, Bloody Difficult Women features two other real-life characters, in Theresa May and Alan Miller, Gina’s husband. The Mail’s legal team suggested I had given May and the Millers sight of the script. For the avoidance of doubt, none of them has requested – or been granted – that privilege. Quite frankly, I found it hard enough writing a play without four of its leading characters leaning over my shoulder seeing if they come out of it well. Though the lawyers said their client had no wish to restrict my or the theatre’s artistic freedom of expression, the prospect of a character as menacing as Dacre going through every word of the script is, of course, more than a wee bit inhibiting. May’s office, while courteous and interested when I told them about the play, raised no objections. Even the title – a nod to Ken Clarke’s famous off-mic description of the former prime minister – left them unperturbed. With Gina, I wanted to check the basic timetable of events leading up to the case and beyond, but that was it. She gamely tweeted that she would be watching it through her fingers. Still, I can understand, given there has been press speculation that Dacre is the “villain of the piece” (and that I don’t share his views about Brexit), that he might have special concerns. Every day, however, a great many people no doubt have special concerns about what his newspapers are going to write about them, but they are seldom, if ever, granted sight of the stories ahead of publication. Long before the EU referendum and the start of that almighty national row, I’d worked for Dacre as a feature writer, and, latterly, deputy to the late diarist Nigel Dempster, for almost a decade. Our relationship was respectful, but not close. He was and is, as I make clear in the play, a strident character. The last of the all-powerful – one might say imperial – editors. The letters from his legal department have made for a few dark days for me, too, but I’ve had the play painstakingly factchecked. From the outset, I strained to be fair to all its characters and kept in mind Chekhov’s rule that plays shouldn’t be about good or bad people, only people. All I want now is for the show to go on. The plan had originally been to open last June, but that was put back to November on account of the pandemic and so its launch next month will, I’m confident, be third time lucky. It is a play that seems to be acquiring over time a certain radical chic. All journalists can, of course, be thin-skinned and I am no exception. I recall, when I was working for Dacre, being upset when I’d read that Norma Major, the former prime minister’s wife, had said a biography I’d written of her had been “99% inaccurate”. I asked Dacre if anything could be done and he wearily intoned that if I was going to dish it out, I’d have to learn to take it too. I await the reviews for Bloody Difficult Women in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday with trepidation, but I’ve no intention of asking to “fact check” them ahead of publication.

1/25/2022,"The Solihull Moors striker Andrew Dallas achieved a personal best on Saturday when he scored all the goals in the 5-0 victory over Dover Athletic. While being on the receiving end of such a feat was painful for Dover, the club could soon register an even less desirable landmark. Failure to beat Eastleigh at home on Tuesday would mean the National League’s bottom side will have gone a full year without winning a match. Actually, make that nearly two years. Because Dover’s 3-1 victory over Barnet on 26 January 2021 was expunged, along with all their other results from last season, meaning that, officially, their most recent win was the 5-1 triumph over Fylde on 22 February 2020. An amusing piece of trivia, perhaps, but Dover’s woes are no laughing matter. This is a club which had made great progress until the pandemic struck. The table only hints at how things have gone awry: four draws and 20 defeats from 24 matches this season have left them with a points tally of -8.  They began their campaign on -12 points as punishment for not fulfilling fixtures last season, when their chairman, Jim Parmenter, refused to take out a loan to enable his team to play on. Parmenter, who had presided over three promotions since taking over his hometown club in 2005, maintains that, once it became clear that National Lottery grants would only cover the first two months of last season, the responsible course of action would have been for the whole National League to stop until crowds returned. But as a majority of clubs (13) voted to continue, Dover were ordered to toe the line. “Last season I said I’m not going to put the club in hock for half a million to a million pounds to play games in a nothing season with no crowds and no community activity,” says Parmenter, who argued that the league’s stance was hypocritical after years of encouraging clubs to be financially prudent. “I took the club over in 2005 when it was half a million in debt and about to go out of business and had suffered two relegations. I sorted all that out and got the club back into the National League. I said at the time I’m never going to put the club back into debt because it’s a road to ruin. “So last season I said I’m going to put all the people on furlough so that they’re still earning money because I can’t afford to pay them and we’ll sit tight until we’re allowed crowds back in. And for that I was punished with a 12-point deduction and £40,000 fine. How does that help the good of football?” He resigned from the league’s board in the wake of that decision. Parmenter also objected to suggestions he should have stumped up the money if he did not want to take out loans. “One of the written reasons [from the league] was that I didn’t tell them enough about my personal financial situation to justify what I did,” he says. “The football club is a limited company; why would I tell them about my personal financial situation? They were basically saying I should sell my house and pay for the football club. I’ve probably put £5m into the club since 2005 so I think I’ve done my bit.” Parmenter, who has retired from the grocery business he used to run, still bankrolls a portion of Dover’s annual budget, which he says is between £1m and £1.2m. He is looking for investors. “The good thing is we’ll get to the end of this season with no debt and then we’ll be in a position to push on next season,” he says. “We’ll be relegated – probably – but without the loans that the two other clubs who go down will probably have taken and I think that’s what prudent management should be.” Dover lost most of their players after their premature end to last season and began this campaign with an almost entirely new squad. “We had to go from full-time to part-time overnight because we couldn’t afford full-time wages,” Parmenter says. “We’re now training two nights a week instead of four days and, therefore, you have a different type of player. We can’t afford to compete with the multimillion-pound budgets in this league. We played Stockport County and I think two of their players were earning more than our entire squad.” Yet Dover have not looked completely out of their depth. Their home games attract between 700 and 800 spectators, about 30% down on pre-Covid levels. “I think what most football fans want to see is competitive matches and, funny as it sounds, I still go to the ground thinking: ‘We have a chance of winning today,’” says Paul Harrison, who has been watching Dover for nearly two decades. “Apart from four or five matches we’ve been in every game. You can still see the players’ effort and drive. Maybe when things go against them, like conceding a goal, it’s harder to get the oomph to fight back.” Harrison says he and his family will be in attendance on Tuesday. “Whenever we get that win, I hope it’s at home so that we can have a quick drink afterwards.”",Sport/Football,"One year, no wins: decimated Dover fight to avoid unwanted anniversary",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/one-year-no-wins-decimated-dover-fight-to-avoid-unwanted-anniversary
1/25/2022,"As Rafael Nadal initiated another run at the Australian Open this year, he was as curious about how well his game and body would serve him as anyone else. He had endured a six-month layoff due to a chronic foot injury, a tough bout with Covid at precisely the wrong time and he arrived in Melbourne having barely spent time on-court in the preceding few weeks. The hope, he said, was that he would keep himself in the tournament long enough to keep on improving. On Tuesday afternoon he maintained his spot in the tournament but only by the narrowest of margins and it took all that he had. He led Denis Shapovalov by two sets, only for the Canadian to courageously pull Nadal all the way back into a desperate fifth set. After four long hours, Nadal rose to win 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 3-6, 6-3 and reach his seventh semi-final at the Australian Open.  Immediately after his victory, Nadal was asked how he managed to turn the match around. He shook his head: “I don’t know, honestly,” he said. “I was completely destroyed after that. Very tough day, very warm. Honestly, I didn’t practise for this. I was a little lucky at the beginning of the fifth. At the beginning of the match I was playing great, then I know how difficult it is to play against a player like Denis. He’s very talented, very aggressive. He was serving huge, especially the second serve.” Nadal was extremely sharp from the beginning as he took hold of the match. He served well from the early stages, he found a high number of forehands and dominated with it from the middle of the court. Throughout the first two sets, Nadal took a more economical approach to his return games, continually mixing up his positioning and spending much time receiving second serves from on top of the baseline. Across the net, the Canadian exhibited all of the worst parts of his game in the first two sets. He was erratic and unreliable, spraying three consecutive forehand errors in his second service game to hand over the break and he complemented Nadal’s excellent serving with dire returns. Early in the second set, Shapovalov directed his frustration at the time Nadal took between points. After an argument with the umpire, Carlos Bernardes, he turned around and shouted: “You guys are all corrupt.” As Nadal continually pushed Shapovalov to 30-30 and deuce on his service games, the match seemed to be edging towards its climax. But throughout the third set, Shapovalov showed his toughness, digging out gritty holds with bold shotmaking and continually pumping himself up. It was instead Nadal’s serve that began to crumble. While Shapovalov took control of the baseline, Nadal double faulted four times in the third set. Then, under more pressure, Nadal promptly gave the decisive break away at 2-1 in the fourth set with a double fault. The momentum was flying in Shapovalov’s direction and he began to hold serve with ease. Nadal called the physio onto the court and they appeared to evaluate him for stomach issues. Nadal took some tablets and then continued, but Shapovalov responded with bold, excellent serving to turn the game around, closing off the set with an unreturned second serve. The final set began with an intermission, as Nadal received further medical evaluation off the court before taking a bathroom break. When he returned, Shapovalov’s stinging shots continued to fly through the court and Nadal immediately faced a breakpoint at 30-40. He saved it with an unreturned serve and held firm. The decisive moment came at 1-0 in the final set as Shapovalov capitulated on his serve. He opened with two forehand errors, then he struck a double fault to trail 0-40, eventually giving away the break with a shanked backhand error. He ended the fifth set with 13 unforced errors to Nadal’s five. Despite his service woes, his apparent physical issues and a much younger, hungry opponent across the net, Nadal held onto his serve throughout the set and he moved on to reach his first Australian Open semi-final since 2019. As he soaked in his victory, Nadal reflected on his journey over the past few months. From questioning his future in the game, he is now a grand slam semi-finalist once more and two wins from his 21st major title. “Two months ago we didn’t know if we would be able to be back on tour, at all,” he said. “So, here I am. For me, it is a present of life that I am playing tennis again.”",Sport/Sport,Nadal survives Shapovalov comeback to reach Australian Open semi-finals,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/nadal-survives-shapovalov-comeback-to-reach-australian-open-semi-finals
1/25/2022,"The scale of the number of children who have lost out on their schooling during the pandemic is “nearly insurmountable”, according to UN data. Up to 70% of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries cannot read or understand a simple text, up from 53% pre-Covid, the research suggested.  Classroom closures continue to affect more than 635 million children globally, with younger and more marginalised children facing the greatest loss in learning after almost two years of Covid, according to children’s agency Unicef, which called for intensive support to help students recover. Across the world, from Ethiopia to the US, children have lost basic literacy and numeracy skills and their mental and physical health has suffered. In South Africa, schoolchildren are between 75% and a whole school year behind where they should be, with up to 500,000 having dropped out of school altogether between March 2020 and October 2021. Learning losses have been seen in the US, including in California, Colorado, Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Maryland. In Texas, two-thirds of children in grade 3 (age eight to nine) tested below their grade level in maths in 2021, compared with half of children in 2019. In Ethiopia, primary age children are estimated to have learned between 30-40% of the maths they would have in a normal school year. Robert Jenkins, Unicef’s head of education, said: “In March, we will mark two years of Covid-related disruptions to global education. Quite simply, we are looking at a nearly insurmountable scale of loss to children’s schooling. While the disruptions to learning must end, just reopening schools is not enough. Students need intensive support to recover lost education. “Schools must also go beyond places of learning to rebuild children’s mental and physical health, social development and nutrition.”",News/Global development,UN data reveals ‘nearly insurmountable’ scale of lost schooling due to Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/25/un-data-reveals-nearly-insurmountable-scale-of-lost-schooling-due-to-covid
1/25/2022,"Campaigners who fought to “free” the Aboriginal flag have welcomed the federal government’s $20m deal to buy out the private companies who held exclusive licences over its use and charged Aboriginal community groups for permission. But they say questions remain about its future custodianship, now that copyright rests with the commonwealth, and are asking exactly how much public money the non-Indigenous businesses were paid to relinquish their control.  “I feel like this is as good as we’re going to get in terms of freeing the Aboriginal flag,” Laura Thompson, convenor of the #freetheflag campaign, said on Tuesday. “It is a significant amount of money, but we paid $30m for the boxing kangaroo. Can you compare the significance of the Aboriginal flag to the boxing kangaroo? “My grandkids, my great-grandkids, will have the Aboriginal flag in their lives, uniting them and supporting their culture and making them feel safe in community.” On Monday, the federal government announced that after more than two years of “extremely complicated” negotiations, it had struck a deal to acquire copyright from the flag’s designer, Luritja artist Harold Thomas, and make it “free” for public use. Previously, Thomas’s sole copyright allowed him to grant licences to other parties to make copies of the flag, or refuse permission entirely. In 2018, he gave an exclusive licence to a non-Indigenous business called WAM Clothing, who raised the ire of many by issuing infringement notices to small non-profit Aboriginal organisations as well as the AFL and NRL, for their past use of the design. WAM Clothing is part-owned by Ben Wooster, whose previous company, Birubi Art, was fined a record $2.3m by the federal court after finding it had breached consumer law by selling fake Aboriginal art. The #freetheflag movement began after Thompson’s business, Clothing the Gaps, was served with a cease and desist notice from WAM. Thompson said it was a relief that private companies were now “out of the picture” but some questions remained. “The fact that the Aboriginal flag was controlled, and privately owned, is just absurd,” she said. “The question is now, with this payout, are they going to pay the fine back to the ACCC? We’ve got the Aboriginal flag back in the public domain, now we [have to] start to look at how did we end up in this mess in the first place, in a copyright tangle with the flag? “It really has to come back down to when the government proclaimed the flag back in 1995. They should have made sure that they bought the copyright, and made sure that it wasn’t under copyright at that time before they proclaimed it as an official flag of this country.” In 1995, the governor general proclaimed it along with the Torres Strait Islander flag. Other claimants came forward asserting they were the artist behind it but in 1997 the federal court officially recognised Thomas as the sole author. That meant he could assign licences. By 2019, amid mounting distress and confusion over who was able to use the design freely, a parliamentary inquiry was set up to look into the copyright and licensing arrangements. Its final report labelled WAM Clothing’s actions as “heavy-handed”. Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy, who chaired the Senate select committee examining the Aboriginal flag, said she intended to seek answers about how future arrangements would operate. “I’d like to commend the people who gave evidence and advocated to help resolve this issue,” McCarthy said. “I look forward to examining the details around this deal through Senate estimates next month, in particular the copyright and custodianship of the flag.” The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, told ABC Radio on Tuesday that “the benefits in the long term far outweigh what we expended”. “It’s about giving back the flag to be freely used,” he said. “Harold [Thomas] said he wanted the flag to be flown with dignity. It should be always be respected and from that first moment when it was flown in Adelaide, and then later at the tent embassy, it’s been highly valued. And our people do respect the three colours.” Thomas made a rare public statement on Monday and was photographed signing the deal as part of the government’s announcement. “I hope this arrangement provides comfort to all Aboriginal people and Australians to use the flag, unaltered, proudly and without restriction,” he said. “I am grateful that my art is appreciated by so many, and that it has come to represent something so powerful to so many.”",News/Australia news,Deal to ‘free’ Aboriginal flag welcomed – but questions remain,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/deal-to-free-aboriginal-flag-welcomed-but-questions-remain
1/25/2022,"When Adnan Sheikh took his family on holiday to Sri Lanka last October, he booked them into a hotel for two weeks in Sarakkuwa beach, just off the coast from where the X-Press Pearl cargo ship caught fire and sank five months previously. Sheikh had been charmed by the online pictures of golden sandy beaches. But when the family arrived, it was a different story.  “My kids wanted to play on the beaches and swim, but the beach was black and it seemed unsafe to even walk [on it],” says Sheikh. The charred fuel oil and burnt debris were from the wreckage of the container ship, and littered among them was perhaps the worst hazard of all: tiny plastic pellets called nurdles. Millions or even billions of nurdles have been washing up along the island’s coastline for hundreds of miles, from Mannar in the north to Kirinda in the south. A UN report called the incident in May 2021 the “single largest plastic spill” in history, with about 1,680 tonnes of nurdles released into the ocean. Most of them were partly burnt and contaminated with chemicals and debris from the ship spill, posing even more of a threat to marine life – and the local community. The disaster sparked a massive clean-up effort. The Sri Lankan navy and the Marine Environment Protection Authority (Mepa) organised about 50,000 local people, mainly women, to collect nurdles and other debris – 60,000 bags of it so far. Each bag holds 50kg. The women remove the nurdles using trommel machines, drum-like rotating sieves that filter plastic pellets from the sand. Other methods include hand-sieving and simply picking them out. In Sarakkuwa beach alone, the locals collect an average of 80-100kg of nurdles and debris every day, which they exchange for 3,000 rupees (£11) a day from the government. While the biggest, most visible piles of nurdles have been removed, it’s just the tip of the iceberg, says Hemantha Withanage, director and environmentalist at the Centre for Environmental Justice in Sri Lanka. “They completed the surface cleaning of nurdles, but nurdles are now buried under the sand, about two metres deep in some places. Most burnt nurdles are tiny particles we can’t remove with sieving or trommels.” A Sri Lankan firm has developed a new machine that can remove smaller pellets, but Mepa has rejected it due to its cost, says Withanage – though he claims the Sri Lankan government could attempt to recoup the expense from the shipping company. Sri Lanka has so far filed two interim claims. There is widespread anger here at the company’s perceived role in the nurdle spill. “These nurdles were stored inside polythene bags instead of hard containers, which made it easier to spill,” Withanage says. A few weeks ago, a team from Mepa found a large polythene sack of nurdles buried a metre under the sand. Sri Lanka wants nurdles declared a toxic waste, and has submitted a proposal to regulate maritime transportation of plastic pellets to the International Maritime Organization, which will be discussed this year. But that will not help Sri Lanka’s current situation. In 2019, before the pandemic hit, tourism made up 12.6% of Sri Lanka’s GDP, and is roughly the third largest source of foreign exchange. To Naleen Chathuranga, pastry chef at the five-star Goldi Sands hotel, located 10 miles north of Sarakkuwa on a vast sandy beach fringed with coconut palms and overlooking the azure ocean, the damage is deep. “Nurdles are everywhere now,” says Chathuranga, digging his toes into the moist sand to unearth dozens of tiny pellets. Nearby, as two teenage boys swim, every wave leaves a line of nurdles along the shore. But tourism can recover, he says. “Tourists know more than us about the ship disaster, but they still come here.” Visitors are slowly returning thanks to the area being close to the country’s international airport; for many tourists, Negombo is a pitstop before they fly out. The luxury hotels also spend money on their own private cleanup efforts to keep their local beaches clean. For the fishing community, however, there are fears the impact could be felt for a long time. “Fishing is really poor these days,” says Veerapalli Shiva, a 51-year-old fisherman originally from Kochchikade in Colombo. Shiva goes out to sea every day with 17 others who work for the owner of their boat. He only earned 250 rupees today, which is all he has to provide for his wife and three school-age children. “We’ve been fishing here since November, and not a single day was lucrative,” he says. “We only find small fishes now. Large fishes, who bag a better price in the market, are missing. This has never happened before.” Withanage says that most fishers were out of work for several months after the nurdle spill, and that the government was little help: Shiva only received 15,000 rupees as compensation; some received just 5,000. “The authorities have also forgotten that we are fishing in contaminated waters,” Withanage says. “These harmful effects should be added to the compensation claim so that the government can use funds to help them.” Meanwhile, the nurdles keep coming, piling up on the decks of the fishing boats. “Sometimes our feet were buried in tiny pellets,” Shiva says. “We don’t have a choice. We touch them every day. They have become a part of our life now.”",News/Environment,‘Nurdles are everywhere’: how plastic pellets ravaged a Sri Lankan paradise,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/25/nurdles-are-everywhere-how-plastic-pellets-ravaged-a-sri-lankan-paradise
