1/14/2022,"A Canadian court has halved the sentence of a woman who killed her husband, revisiting a controversial case that revealed the legal system’s “outdated thinking” of the realities of domestic abuse. In a 2-1 ruling released Wednesday, Alberta’s court of appeal determined that Helen Naslund’s 18-year sentence should be reduced to nine years.  “It is beyond time for this court to explicitly recognize that cases of battered women killing abusive partners involve unique circumstances that must be considered by the sentencing judge, particularly where battered woman syndrome is involved,” Justice Sheila Greckol wrote for the majority. According to an agreed statement of facts, in 2011 Helen Naslund, a grandmother of eight, shot her husband, Miles Naslund, in the back of the head while he slept. The killing came after Miles Naslund had physically and emotionally abused her for nearly three decades, prompting Helen Naslund to attempt suicide on multiple occasions. After the killing, Helen Naslund and her sons hid Miles Naslund’s body in a pond on their property, buried his car and kept the crime a secret for six years. While her son Neil received a three-year sentence, Helen Naslund agreed to a joint submission by the defence and crown prosecutors that would see her serve a sentence of 18 years for manslaughter, thereby avoiding a trial and the likelihood of a far harsher sentence if convicted. The sentence made headlines back in 2020 as one of the longest handed down in the case of an abused woman killing her partner and prompted more than 25,000 people to sign a petition in her defence. In the appeal court’s decision, Greckol faulted the sentencing judge, Sterling Sanderman, for his failure to account for the decades of abuse Naslund suffered. “The sentencing judge suggested that Ms Naslund had ‘other options’ open to her, implicitly the option to walk out the door,” Greckol wrote. “For the sentencing judge to suggest that battered women have ‘other options’ is to invoke a stereotype that a battered woman stays in a situation of domestic violence by choice.” Greckol also found the sentence of 18 years was excessive, pointing to a number of previous cases in Canada where sentences ranging from a suspended sentence to eight years. “Counsel … failed to fully explain to the sentencing judge how they arrived at a sentence markedly harsher than those imposed in similar cases,” she wrote. Writing in the dissent, however, Justice Thomas Wakeling disagreed there was evidence of battered woman syndrome and argued that if Naslund’s case had gone to trial, she would likely have received life in prison with no with no chance of parole for nearly two decades. “I am satisfied that the notional reasonable observer would conclude that Ms Naslund has no good reason to complain about this bargain,” he wrote of the deal reached between prosectors and the defence, adding that she never claimed to have received poor legal counsel. “It has probably saved her many years of prison time.” In a statement issued through her lawyer, Helen Naslund said she was “incredibly grateful” for the support she’d received over the years. “I hope that other women can benefit from the court’s recognition of the terrible situation in which battered women find themselves.” Her son Neil told CBC News he was happy with the outcome. “She will get to spend more time involved in her grandkids’ lives and have the chance to see her very senior father before he passes, and for that I’m very happy,” he wrote in a text message. With her reduced sentence, Naslund may be able to apply for parole by the end of 2022.

1/14/2022,"There have been precious few positives during the Covid pandemic but British academics may have unearthed one: people look more attractive in protective masks. Researchers at Cardiff University were surprised to find that both men and women were judged to look better with a face covering obscuring the lower half of their faces.  In what may be a blow for producers of fashionable coverings – and the environment – they also discovered that a face covered with a disposable-type surgical mask was likely to be deemed the most appealing. Dr Michael Lewis, a reader from Cardiff University’s school of psychology and an expert in faces, said research carried out before the pandemic had found that medical face masks reduced attractiveness because they were associated with disease or illness. “We wanted to test whether this had changed since face coverings became ubiquitous and understand whether the type of mask had any effect,” he said. “Our study suggests faces are considered most attractive when covered by medical face masks. This may be because we’re used to healthcare workers wearing blue masks and now we associate these with people in caring or medical professions. At a time when we feel vulnerable, we may find the wearing of medical masks reassuring and so feel more positive towards the wearer.” In the first part of the research, carried out in February 2021 by which time the British population had become used to wearing masks in some circumstances, 43 women were asked to rate the attractiveness of images of male faces without a mask, wearing a plain cloth mask, a blue medical face mask, and holding a plain black book covering the area a face mask would hide, on a scale of one to 10. The participants said those wearing a cloth mask were significantly more attractive than the ones with no masks or whose faces were partly obscured by the book. But the surgical mask – which was just a normal, disposable kind – made the wearer look even better. “The results run counter to the pre-pandemic research where it was thought masks made people think about disease and the person should be avoided,” said Lewis. “The pandemic has changed our psychology in how we perceive the wearers of masks. When we see someone wearing a mask we no longer think ‘that person has a disease, I need to stay away’. “This relates to evolutionary psychology and why we select the partners we do. Disease and evidence of disease can play a big role in mate selection – previously any cues to disease would be a big turn-off. Now we can observe a shift in our psychology such that face masks are no longer acting as a contamination cue.” Lewis said it was also possible that masks made people more attractive because they directed attention to the eyes. He said other studies had found that covering the left or right half of a face also made people look more attractive, partly because the brain fills in the missing gaps and exaggerates the overall impact. The results of the first study, looking at how women perceived men in masks, has been published in the journal Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications. A second study has been carried out, in which a group of men look at women in masks; it has yet to be published but Lewis said the results were broadly the same. The researchers did not ask the participants to spell out their sexual orientations.",News/World news,"Face masks make people look more attractive, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/face-masks-make-people-look-more-attractive-study-finds
1/14/2022,"European rugby fixtures can go ahead as planned this weekend after the French government relaxed its rules on travellers entering the country from the UK. Newcastle, Bath and Sale are all due to play in France this weekend and had expressed reservations over travelling if restrictions remained in place but Thursday’s announcement gives those sides the green light. The clubs were willing to boycott their fixtures if a ruling that required all travellers to isolate for 48 hours before producing a negative test remained in place. The clubs were worried that members of their party could be stranded in France for 10 days but, as of Friday morning, fully vaccinated travellers only have to show proof of a negative test taken 24 hours before departure.  It means that Newcastle’s Challenge Cup match at Biarritz on Friday, Bath’s Champions Cup clash with La Rochelle on Saturday and Sunday’s fixture between Clermont and Sale will now go ahead as planned. The Scarlets are also in action away to Bordeaux on Sunday. Restrictions remain for players and staff who are not fully vaccinated, however, and the Sale director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, has admitted that will mean the Sharks are not entirely at full strength on Sunday. Those who are not fully vaccinated would have to isolate for 10 days and that in turn causes a potential headache for England, who travel to France for their final Six Nations match on 19 March, unless overseas sportspeople are given exemption by the French government. About 96% of Premiership players are fully vaccinated but the England and Exeter centre Henry Slade has previously explained why he would not be receiving any jabs. Nonetheless the French government’s decision to “ease the specific health border control measures that were decided in December for vaccinated travellers from the United Kingdom” is a boost for organisers of the Champions and Challenge Cups, European Professional Club Rugby. It had to cancel seven fixtures – which have now been designated as 0-0 draws – in December when France effectively closed its borders with the UK and was left scrambling to save this season’s competitions. “The uncertainty of it has created angst for a lot of people who do all the organising,” said Newcastle’s director of rugby, Dean Richards. “I saw the relaxation of the rules being brought in by the French government and welcome that entirely. We’ve sat down and talked about it on a daily basis. On an hourly basis actually. You need to take 40 people to a place but don’t quite know if you’re going to go or not and fork out for it or not.”",Sport/Sport,European club rugby fixtures to go ahead after France relaxes Covid rules,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/13/european-club-rugby-fixtures-to-go-ahead-after-france-relaxes-covid-rules
1/14/2022,"Dozens of journalists and human rights defenders in El Salvador have been subjected to “jaw-dropping” phone hacks using the Pegasus spyware allegedly deployed by governments around the world against dissidents, reporters, diplomats and members of the clergy, according to internet security researchers. Reporting on its latest findings about the use of the Israeli firm NSO Group’s spyware, the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab said it had identified a Pegasus operator working almost exclusively in El Salvador in early 2020.  Citizen Lab found that 35 journalists and civil society activists had been targeted over an 16-month period that coincided with their investigations into allegations that the government of President Nayib Bukele was negotiating a pact with El Salvador’s street gangs to reduce violence and win their electoral support. The news comes two months after the Biden administration put NSO Group on a US blacklist after determining the spyware company had acted “contrary to the foreign policy and national security interests of the US”. Although the researchers could not conclusively link the hacks to the Bukele’s government, the report said “the strong country-specific focus of the infections suggests that this is very likely”. Such suggestions, however, were denied by the Bukele government. “El Salvador is no way associated with Pegasus and nor is it a client of NSO Group,” said Sofía Medina, a spokeswoman for Bukele. Bukele has often hit out at his critics in El Salvador’s independent press – many of whom were targeted in the hacking attacks. The 40-year-old president – who once referred to himself as “the world’s coolest dictator” – made international headlines in February 2020 when he marched soldiers in combat fatigues into congress and told MPs to approve a loan for new security equipment or be summoned back in seven days for another session. Citizen Lab conducted a forensic analysis of 37 devices and found evidence of incursions on the phones that occurred between July 2020 and November 2021. Their investigation, carried out with Access Now, was reviewed by Amnesty International’s Security Lab. John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Lab and an author of the report, said the “aggressiveness and persistence of the hacking was jaw-dropping”. He added: “I’ve seen a lot of Pegasus cases but what was especially disturbing in this case was its juxtaposition with the physical threats and violent language against the media in El Salvador. This is the kind of thing that perhaps wouldn’t surprise you in a dictatorship, but at least on paper El Salvador is a democracy.” Twenty-two of those targeted work for the independent news site El Faro, which during the period of hacking, was working on stories related to the Bukele administration’s alleged deal-making with El Salvador’s street gangs to lower the homicide rate and to support Bukele’s party in mid-term elections in exchange for benefits to gang leaders. Bukele has vehemently denied there was any negotiation with the gangs. But in December last year, the US government accused his government of secretly negotiating a truce with leaders of the country’s feared MS-13 and Barrio 18 street gangs, and financial sanctions were imposed on two officials from Buekele’s administration. Carlos Dada, El Faro’s director, said the high point of interventions in their phones was in September 2020, when El Faro broke the story about the alleged negotiations between the government and the gangs. “These coincidences in the end are not so gratuitous,” he said. “The highest intensity of the telephone interventions against 22 people at El Faro happened in the months around our most sensitive publications and most critical of the government.” In a statement, NSO said it does not operate the technology once it is given to a client and cannot know the targets of its customers. But it said the use of its tools to monitor activists, dissidents or journalists “is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools”. It noted that it has terminated multiple contracts in the past due to client misuse. NSO does not identify its customers. But sources familiar with the company said it does not currently have an active system in El Salvador. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were discussing the company’s clients, said NSO is trying to obtain the phone numbers that were tracked and will investigate to see if there was any misuse. “The company will act with all measures at its disposal based on the contractual agreements,” the sources said. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s Americas director, said the use of Pegasus in El Salvador had revealed “a new threat to human rights” in the country. She added: “The authorities must stop any efforts to restrict freedom of expression, and conduct a thorough and impartial investigation to identify those responsible.” NSO group was placed on the US blacklist three months after a consortium of journalists working with the French non-profit group Forbidden Stories, revealed multiple cases of journalists and activists who were hacked by foreign governments using the spyware, including American citizens. The Guardian and other members of the consortium also revealed that the mobile numbers of Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and nearly his entire cabinet were contained on a leaked list of individuals who were selected as possible targets of surveillance. NSO has said that its spyware is used by foreign government clients to target serious criminals. It has also denied that any of its clients ever targeted Macron or any French government officials.",News/News,Pegasus spyware used in ‘jaw-dropping’ phone hacks on El Salvador journalists,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/13/pegasus-spyware-target-journalists-activists-el-salvador
1/14/2022,"Sales at Halfords dropped off in December, as the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid caused consumers to stay at home, while supply chain disruption delayed deliveries of some its children’s bicycles. The cycling and motoring retailer said sales of children’s bikes started well during the 13 weeks to the end of December but were knocked by unexpected freight delays.  This was compounded by the drop in footfall at Halfords stores, as consumers behaved cautiously amid fears of Omicron. The retailer said in September it was experiencing supply chain disruption, after previously benefiting from a bike boom during the pandemic as commuters and families tried out transport on two wheels. Halfords said there had been a “strong performance during October and November but a drop-off in performance in the latter part of the period as the Omicron variant grew in prominence”. Sales of cycling products during the festive period dropped by 2.1% compared with 2019, while sales of motoring products also dropped by 1.5% over the same period, leading to an overall fall of 1.8%. The retailer closed more than 10% of its shops during the pandemic, as it sought to make its store estate more profitable, leaving it with 404 Halfords stores. Viewed on a like-for-like basis, by comparing sales at stores that remain open, retail sales rose by 5.6% during the final three months of the year. Halfords’ trading during the festive period was boosted by the performance of its auto centres, where like-for-like sales rose by 33%, thanks for greater demand from drivers for MOTs. The chief executive, Graham Stapleton, said: “The outstanding performance from our autocentres business confirms the rationale behind our recent acquisitions. With the recent addition of National to the group, motoring will represent more than 70% of our revenue, and we expect to carry out 7.5m motoring servicing jobs a year.” He added that the company planned to offer car servicing in more locations across the country, at garages and mobile service vans. The retailer said the knock to trading showed that Covid-19 remained a challenge for businesses, although it expected the impact of Omicron to dwindle. Halfords also expects sales of motoring products to reduce in the coming months, as consumers take fewer domestic holidays.",News/Business,Halfords sales slide as Omicron fears keep shoppers away,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/13/halfords-sales-omicron-bike-retailer-covid-virus
1/14/2022,"Over the last decade and more, no Lieder recitals have given me more intense pleasure than those by the tenor Christoph Prégardien. Though he is now in his mid 60s, and his voice has inevitably lost some of its former bloom and flexibility with age, this Brahms disc, recorded in 2020, confirms that the sheer intelligence of Prégardien’s performances, his immaculate diction and the perfect weight and colour he gives to each phrase, still conjure revelatory interpretations from everything he sings. The collection sees the start of what Naxos plans to be a complete survey of Brahms’s songs. How much of the series will be allotted to Prégardien isn’t clear, but with Ulrich Eisenlohr as his partner, the communicative power and mastery of every nuance of this opening instalment make one hope that the pair will be regularly involved.  The four groups of songs cover almost a quarter of a century in Brahms’s development, from the nine songs of Op 32, completed in 1864, to the five of Op 105, which date to 1888. As Eisenlohr points out in his very thorough sleeve notes, the poems that Brahms set are rarely of the highest class – in that respect he differed in his approach to Lieder writing from his 19th-century predecessors, such as Schubert and Schumann; Gottfried Keller and Theodor Storm are probably the best known of the writers represented here. But each of these sets mixes and matches material from a variety of sources: Op 32, for instance, juxtaposes German translations of the 14th-century Persian lyric poet Hafez with poems by the early Romantic August von Platen-Hallermünde, while Op 43 includes a text from Des Knaben Wunderhorn, the folk collection that Mahler would later explore so extensively. However lowly or mundane the words, though, Prégardien treats them with the respect he would give to a poem by Heine or Goethe, just as Brahms extracts every morsel of meaning in his settings. It’s fair to say that there is no intrinsically great music here; what we have, though, are outstanding performances of all 24 songs, each the product of Prégardien’s craft and his lifetime’s experience in this repertoire. There is more outstanding Brahms from the clarinettist Michael Collins on the BIS label, with the two sonatas Op 120, which were written for his instrument just three years before the composer’s death. The release marks Collins’s 60th birthday later this month, and the sonatas provide a perfect showcase for his creamy tone and superb technical facility; Stephen Hough is the equally immaculate pianist. Their performance of the first sonata, in F minor, is intense and truly searching, that of the second, in E flat, lighter and more relaxed, while as a bonus they add Collins’s own “adaptation” of Brahms’s A major violin sonata Op 100, a more successful translation than one could ever imagine.",Arts/Music,"Brahms: Complete Songs Vol 1 – Opp 32, 43, 86 and 105 review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/brahms-complete-songs-vol-1-opp-32-43-86-and-105-review-masterful-and-revelatory-interpretation
1/14/2022,"FKA twigs recently took to Instagram to depict her mixtape Caprisongs as a soundtrack for preparing to go out: “It’s bronzer in the sink, alcopop on the side … a club pre-game … your bestie who is always late but brings the most to a party.” This is not a description that would fit most of Tahliah Barnett’s oeuvre – to date she has dealt largely in darkness and heartache. But where 2019’s Magdalene came with a sleeve featuring twigs looking troubled, her face disturbingly distorted, on the cover of Caprisongs – the first thing she’s released since she accused her ex-boyfriend Shia LaBeouf of abuse (allegations he denies) – she’s clad in glittering jewellery, pulling down her bottom lip to reveal the acronym GOAT (greatest of all time) written on her teeth. Its contents follow suit.  Twigs herself sounds different: the quivering RP voice she deployed during Magdalene is largely gone, although it makes a brief reappearance during Minds of Men. It’s replaced by something with roots in her adopted home of south London, a better fit for lyrics more obviously rooted in hip-hop and R&B than before, the delivery frequently influenced by the fast-paced triplet flows of rap. There’s a noticeable new buoyancy to the musical approach: “Falling in love all over again, but this time with music and myself”, as she put it on Instagram, in what reads like a response to the distress of her emotional life. FKA twigs’ desire to present herself differently on Caprisongs goes far beyond the visuals and vocal tics. For all the soul-baring on Magdalene, which picked apart the collapse of her relationship with actor Robert Pattinson and the frequently racist and sexist frenzy it engendered on social media, there remained a certain unattainable quality about twigs herself, with her elaborate videos, the warping of her face on album sleeves and her live shows thick with demonstrations of her mastery of tap dancing and sword-based kung fu. Even when singing about heartbreak, she seemed an artist who cleaved to the notion that pop stars should be strange and unearthly, not straightforward reflections of their audience. Caprisongs, however, presents her in a more prosaic light: as your mate, not a mystery. Like Jazmine Sullivan’s 2021 critics’ favourite Heaux Tales, and indeed Adele’s 30, it features intimate voice-note recordings: of twigs bemoaning an ex’s behaviour and discussing her insecurities; of her astrologer, talking a load of wafty old cobblers; and of her friends and collaborators, some of whom attempt to buck twigs up (“I wish you could see in you what I can see in you”), and some of whom expound on their occasionally confusing personal philosophies. “I’m one of a kind – well, people like me are one of a kind,” offers rapper Pa Salieu. The album represents an intriguing shift in a climate where pop stars who adopt personae then stick with them for decades, never breaking character: no Bowie-esque shape-shifting for Lana Del Rey or the Weeknd, who turns up here on Tears in the Club. But, in one sense at least, Caprisongs does resemble its predecessor. The music and production are wildly inventive, as always with twigs, although this time more clearly tethered to beats that take inspiration from trap, drum’n’bass and – on Papi Bones – dancehall. Sounds fly in and out of the mix, tracks frequently feel like one-way journeys, ending up in a completely different place from where they started. Brilliant ideas abound: the dramatic jump-cut changes of Honda’s backing; the wildly chopped-up harp samples on Darjeeling that sound like your internet connection is buffering; a sudden explosion of stacked harmonies and white noise midway through Ride the Dragon. If you’re going to use AutoTune, you might as well do it as imaginatively as she does on Pamplemousse, constantly zapping and shifting the pitch and texture of her vocals. But, as with Magdalene, you’re often unavoidably aware that the songwriting at the centre of Caprisongs is underbaked. There are really good things here: Darjeeling brilliantly interpolates a snatch of Olive’s You’re Not Alone to underline the song’s depiction of London as a place so diverse that anyone can feel at home; Oh My Love has a pretty tune; you wonder if Tears in the Club’s popularity has less to do with its starry special guest than its really strong melody. But more often, Caprisongs settles for the fragmentary: scattered snatches of melodic ideas that might have been more fully developed, tunes that struggle to cut through the sonic tumult around them. Lightbeamers is as hard to grasp as smoke; the patchwork of bass line, chanting and fluttering vocals on Which Way feels as though it’s rambling, despite lasting barely two minutes. There’s a lot that’s laudable about Caprisongs. Not least its desire to keep moving and changing – enough that complaining about something as straightforward as a paucity of memorable tunes almost feels miserly. But equally, it’s something that ultimately impedes your enjoyment of the album. As a soundtrack for the start of a night, it doesn’t quite pan out as you might hope.",Arts/Music,FKA twigs: Caprisongs review – wild invention let down by weak songs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/fka-twigs-caprisongs-review-wild-invention-let-down-by-weak-songs
1/14/2022,"Foreign dramas can be like a little holiday, allowing you to dream of living in a country where the weather, the people or just the interiors are a bracing contrast to what you are used to. Yet it is hard not to look for the ways in which things are the same wherever you go. Good news! Netflix’s new Japanese drama The Journalist is about a corrupt government siphoning off public money. I immediately feel at home.  Land around a school has been sold off cheaply in a deal involving the prime minister and his wife, while another politician is under investigation for his involvement in a startup that has received inordinate government subsidies. The first of these scandals is picked up by our titular hero, Anna Matsuda (Ryôko Yonekura), a maverick broadsheet reporter who is famous for battering government spokespeople in televised press conferences. The more jaded, news-saturated types tuning in may say Matsuda’s interrogations are just wordy showboating – the sort of heavily editorialised haranguing that pleases people who agree with the point, but doesn’t move the story on. At least she is trying to bring the bad guys down, though – and it has made her a star. “She’s incredible!” says one media-savvy young fan, devouring the latest Matsuda clip via smartphone at a cafe table. The Journalist is to some extent a fantasy of fearless, truth-telling reporting. If that were all it was, it would be a straight-up dud. Episode one presents childish views of newspaper journalism – apparently a noble discipline quite separate from the fake news pumped out online – and government malfeasance. The latter manifests as junior civil servants being ordered by senior colleagues to open incriminating documents on their computers, edit out all references to the PM and hit save. Intense closeups of computer screens show us text being typed over. The political analysis is equally basic, with the idea of capitalism as the root cause of the characters’ various miseries hovering constantly in the show’s peripheral vision, but never identified. Rather than being self-serving corporate entities whose interests coincide with the people they are meant to hold to account, media organisations are forever fighting against interference from unseen government “high-ups”. Similarly, the police repeatedly abandon investigations into official wrongdoing – another motif for which you don’t need to be familiar with Japanese politics to appreciate. But then the second episode brings tragedy and it becomes clear that The Journalist isn’t trying to be a complex drama about power dynamics. It is an open-hearted melodrama about good, ordinary people, whose health and happiness ought to matter, being crushed by injustice. Once the corruption scandal progresses to a life lost, rather than just money misappropriated, the focus is on men in suits whose career aspirations have, over time, inured them to the moral consequences of their work. Slowly, The Journalist breaks down its characters into those who can cope with suppressing their own humanity and those who can’t. As the series wears on and Matsuda keeps the controversy alive, the apologetic bows get deeper as granite professional facades finally crack. “I am truly sorry,” is the most common line of dialogue and, if you can ignore the shameless sad piano in the background, it gets more moving each time you hear it. This is wish fulfilment, based on the question that nags us most when we read about corruption and cover-ups: how can the people who did this sleep at night? We would love to see them unable to do so – and The Journalist indulges that desire. But it does so effectively, setting up simple stories about the emotional fallout of institutional cruelty to remind us what is at stake. Shinobu Terajima gives a controlled, dignified performance as a widow whose bewildered vulnerability gives way to determination, while there is a heartbreaking subplot about an ambiguous bromance between political colleagues, one of whom deeply regrets the way their bond failed to hold when his friend’s idealism cost him dearly. Finally saying the thing that has long being unsaid – whether it’s “I love you” or “I did this and I apologise” – is at the heart of all The Journalist’s dramatic payoffs. In the end, it turns that responsibility towards us. In its later episodes, it is explicit about Japan being a country that has slid into a swamp of dishonesty because its citizens’ apathy has allowed it to do so. If you want something better, the programme says, you – as an individual – have to speak up.

1/14/2022,"A property developer bidding to build a 51-storey apartment tower with only one staircase has put its planning application on hold just hours after the Guardian exposed fire safety concerns. On Thursday evening Ballymore had planned to seek approval for one of the UK’s tallest residential buildings close to Canary Wharf in east London, but withdrew its application after fire safety experts branded as “madness” its plan to build more than 400 flats in a tower two-and-a-half times the height of Grenfell with just one staircase.  Details of the scheme triggered widespread outrage and concern, including from survivors of the disaster at Grenfell Tower, which also had only one staircase. The local MP, Apsana Begum, said constituents were “right to be distressed” and said she would ensure concerns were addressed. On Thursday the London fire brigade also raised formal concerns about the proposals with planners at the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and Ballymore asked for the application to be taken off the planning committee agenda. An LFB spokesperson said the design “does not provide suitable and convenient means of escape and associated evacuation strategy for all building users”. “In buildings with a single escape route, we would expect the developer to have their own fire engineers provide a full review to show the resilience in the event of a fire and this does not appear to have been carried out.” Under current building regulations, a single staircase is allowed in tall buildings if they are designed so that residents can “stay put safely in their flats in the event of a fire”. However, fire safety experts believe that is too risky and the government is reviewing provision of escape routes. One fire safety expert, Arnold Tarling, told the Guardian it was “utter madness that this is still allowed”. A leaseholder in a nearby Ballymore apartment block that caught fire last year described the plan as “very scary” because it could result in evacuees and firefighters trying to use the same stairway in opposite directions. The Grenfell United families group said: “Grenfell had a stay put policy and one stairwell. Seventy-two died. Fifteen of the 72 victims killed were disabled. Personal evacuation plans are still not compulsory for disabled residents. The stay put policy remains. Where are the lessons learnt?” Rabina Khan, a local councillor who was planning to oppose the scheme, said she was “very pleased” that the scheme could now be rethought. “I want to see two stairwells,” she said. “We need to put people before profit.” At least 27 countries have stricter rules than the UK requiring second staircases in tall residential buildings. They are required in all buildings above four storeys in the US, above 25 metres in Belgium and Poland, above 60 metres in Germany and Switzerland, and above 80 metres in Italy. Ballymore’s Cuba Street tower is expected to be 174 metres high. News of the plan for a single staircase caused widespread alarm. Create Streets, an urban design thinktank influential among Conservatives, tweeted: “Stupidity is making the same mistakes again. Towers have their place (they work particularly well for the rich and childless) but should not be the default way of populating our cities.” The Royal Institute of British Architects has meanwhile called on the government’s new building safety regulator to set a new height threshold at which at least two staircases are required in residential towers. A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson said: “Comments from the London fire brigade were received today, which raise a number of issues that will need to be addressed.

1/14/2022,"There’s plenty to ask the man who Donald Sutherland calls “son”. He’s British for starters – born in 1966 in St Mary’s hospital in Paddington. He’s named after American director Warren Kiefer, who directed Donald Sutherland in 1964’s horror Castle of the Living Dead, and grew up with his mother in Canada alongside his twin sister, who looks spookily similar if you care to Google her. Sutherland’s film career has spanned nearly 40 years. He made his debut in 1983 comedy drama Max Dugan Returns with Donald Sutherland and Matthew Broderick. He soon became one of the names associated with the Brat Pack – the group of young Hollywood actors who frequently appeared together in 80s coming-of-age films. He played the bully, Ace, in 1986’s Stand By Me with River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton and Jerry O’Connell; Doc in 1988 and 1989’s Young Guns and Young Guns II with Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez and Christian Slater; and vampire gang leader David Powers in 1987’s The Lost Boys. There’s talk of The Lost Boys being remade with A Quiet Place’s Noah Jupe and Jaeden Martell, from It. How does Kiefer feel about a younger generation fanging up his legacy? Time to join the club? Or death by stereo?  Sutherland was nearly cast as Robin in an early script of Michael Keaton’s 1989 version of Batman. Then there’s 1990 horror Flatliners with – of course – Julia Roberts, 1992’s A Few Good Men … Plus 2002’s Phone Booth, where Kiefer literally but brilliantly phones in his role as a mysterious but threatening voice on the end of a phone in a phone box. Since 2001, you’d probably most associate Kiefer with playing 24’s Jack Bauer, who over nine seasons (and one special) loses his wife, fakes his own death, deliberately becomes addicted to heroin and spends 20 months being tortured by the Chinese, all whilse seemingly holding it in. His bladder of steel has even been the subject of its own Guardian discussion. So – be our guest – and someone please do ask: when does Jack Bauer go to the toilet? Most recently, Sutherland has gone from loyally serving Presidents Palmer and Heller (but not – boo, hiss – President Logan) to playing POTUS in three series of Designated Survivor from 2015 to 2019. At one point, the calm and collected President Kirkman counters a deadly virus spreading over the world, leading some people to wonder: did Kiefer predict the future? Sutherland is also about to release his third country album, Bloor Street (“I asked myself, what do I love about acting and music?” For me, it’s storytelling ...”). He’s in the process of rescheduling his UK tour due to the Covid situation. Still, at least it’s not the lethal Cordilla pulmonary-immuno virus from Day 3 of 24. So, dammit! Post your questions for Kiefer in the comments below by [tick … tock … tick … tock … ] 12:00 hours on Monday and we’ll get Chloe to upload the schematics ready to publish in Film&Music in print and online on 28 January.

1/14/2022,"More than 400 years after Hamlet was performed by a ship’s crew anchored off west Africa in the first known production of a Shakespeare play outside the British Isles, the bard is once again taking to the high seas. In evidence that all the world is indeed a stage, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) has signed a three-year deal with Cunard for productions aboard the company’s flagship cruise liner, Queen Mary 2.  Passengers will be able to enjoy a new one-hour compilation piece, Boundless As the Sea, described by the RSC as “a unique blend of Shakespeare’s iconic love scenes”, in the ship’s purpose-built theatre. The onboard cast will also lead a series of workshops exploring their craft, and “intimate, informal events” in which actors will perform favourite sonnets and speeches, and answer questions from the audience. An abridged version of the RSC’s 2018 production of Miss Littlewood, a musical about the life of actor and director Joan Littlewood, known as the “mother of modern theatre”, will also be performed. Erica Whyman, the RSC’s acting artistic director, said: “Shakespeare can seem forbidding. Some people have been made to feel as though he belongs to a certain kind of audience. So an introduction that opens up how beautiful the language is, that brings the language to life and respects it, can unlock it for new audiences.” The deal with Cunard was a “classy partnership between two organisations offering people the opportunity to expand their horizons”, she added. “In a sense, it’s an extension of what we do already in touring the UK, and we’re very proud of that work. We take a ‘first encounter’ programme which is tailor-made for people who are seeing Shakespeare for the first time to schools and communities in areas of multiple challenges. [This] is just a different way of touring.” Sonia Massai, a professor of Shakespeare studies at King’s College London, said: “The more Shakespeare, the better. Shakespeare has survived, in fact thrived, in any shape or form in which [his work] has been presented to audiences over the last few hundred years. I’m not a purist as a scholar – in fact, I’m really interested in contemporary uses of Shakespeare.” The bard’s plays had “always functioned as a platform for debate about the big questions of our own time. That’s the purpose of the arts more generally, and Shakespeare clearly occupies a central place in that.” The RSC – the “gold standard” of Shakespearean performance – received considerable public funding, so “any innovation, any attempt to reach new audiences, is to be welcomed”. But, she added, cruise ship audiences were “probably quite similar to audiences who already go to Stratford [the RSC’s base] or theatres across the world”. Whyman said the RSC worked “very, very hard in our day to make sure that we’re reaching the most diverse range of audiences. Cunard is a particular project, which allows a particular audience to have access to our work, and there’s no reason to deprive them of that experience”. Prices for the Shakespeare cruises start at £379 a person for an inside cabin on a two-day voyage from Southampton to Hamburg, and reach £19,389 a person for a 26-day round trip between New York and the Norwegian fjords in a top-of-the-range suite. As well as Shakespeare, passengers can enjoy live music, wine tasting, an onboard planetarium and a game of deck quoits. Lee Powell, the vice-president of brand and product at Cunard, said: “To be able to offer our guests access to performances by world leaders in both contemporary theatre and Shakespeare’s finest work is an extraordinary opportunity which I know our guests will fully immerse themselves in.” The RSC declined to disclose financial details of the partnership. The performance of Hamlet on 5 September 1607 onboard the Red Dragon, an English ship on its way to India, was logged in Capt William Keeling’s diary, regarded as authentic by Massai. The play was presented to an eminent guest, the local king’s brother-in-law, Lucas Fernandez. Keeling was pleased enough with the result for his crew to perform Richard II a few weeks later.",Arts/Culture,A tide in the affairs of Shakespeare: the bard meets Cunard in RSC cruise deal,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/13/a-tide-in-the-affairs-of-shakespeare-the-bard-meets-cunard-in-rsc-cruise-deal
1/14/2022,"The chief executive of Countryside Properties has left the company after it failed to cash in on the UK property boom that has fuelled the huge profits at its housebuilding peers. Shares in Countryside were down by a quarter on Thursday, making it the biggest FTSE 250 faller by some distance and wiping £700m off its value, after the company revealed the extent of its poor performance.  Adjusted operating profits more than halved year on year to £16.5m and housing completions fell by more than a third in the three months to the end of December. In contrast, Persimmon on Thursday reported bumper house sales, up a fifth on pre-pandemic levels in the second half of last year. Countryside announced the immediate departure of its chief executive, Iain McPherson, with its chair, John Martin, standing in until a permanent replacement is appointed. Martin said: “Trading in the first quarter of our new financial year has been below the board’s expectations.” He said he would conduct a review process of all of Countryside’s developments to ensure that each site was being developed “in accordance with the plans set out during the investment process”. As part of the boardroom reshuffle the company has appointed Peter Lee, a partner at Browning West – a US-based activist investor that has built up an almost 10% stake to become one of the company’s biggest shareholders – as a non-executive director. Countryside also responded on Thursday to government plans to protect leaseholders from the costs of all post-Grenfell building safety defects, not just combustible cladding. “[We are] fully supportive of finding an industry-wide solution for the benefit of leaseholders,” the company said. “We are currently working with landlords to expedite remediation in cases where the historic work on Countryside developments did not meet building standards.” The departure of McPherson and poor results cap a torrid year for Countryside. In September, the competition regulator forced the company to give formal commitments to free thousands of people who bought leasehold homes from costly contract terms resulting in the doubling of ground rent fees every 10 to 15 years. Countryside has confirmed it no longer sells leasehold properties with doubling-ground rent clauses, following the investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority.",News/Business,Countryside Properties CEO leaves as extent of poor results revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/13/countryside-properties-ceo-leaves-as-extent-of-poor-results-revealed-ain-mcpherson
1/14/2022,"During Britain’s Covid crisis, the state had little hesitation in cracking down on citizens deemed to violate the rules. Just eight days before the party in the prime minister’s garden, a 45-year-old homeless man was hauled before the courts for violating lockdown restrictions. In fact, the police were so overzealous in their use of lockdown rules that the Crown Prosecution Service later found three in 10 cases had been incorrectly charged. All in all, more than 100,000 fines have been handed out to people in England alone for an assortment of offences: from not wearing a face covering to mixing with people outside of your bubble. Needless to say, fines were not evenly distributed, with Black people seven times more likely to be fined by the police for lockdown breaches than white people. Of the total number of people fined, 371 people have been slapped with the maximum fee of £10,000 for – and wait for it – hosting gatherings of more than 30 people.  Such a sum is easily payable if you are earning something like – to pluck a random figure – the prime minister’s £161,401 salary. For millions of people, such a sum is financially ruinous: as it is, around two-thirds of the UK’s population carry personal debt. All of this stands in the great tradition of the British state, of course. Many of our ministers have admitted to snorting or smoking a cacophony of illegal substances and cocaine traces have been found in parliament – unsurprisingly to anyone familiar with political circles, who knows that drug use is rife in them. Yet our ministers face no legal consequences for their substance use as they cheerlead a war on drugs that leaves Black people more likely to be arrested, charged and imprisoned for drug offences, often with life-ruining consequences. Our legal system cracks down on benefit fraud committed by the poorest, yet offers a whole series of legal tax loopholes for the well-to-do to exploit with abandon. One rule for them, another for us isn’t a cheap rhetorical device – it’s a statement of fact. That our prime minister and dozens of his officials were necking booze in the garden while ordinary citizens were being harassed by police officers is a self-evident affront. That the Metropolitan police have so far had insufficient evidence to take legal action against No 10 for multiple parties despite numerous officers being posted on the estate, but have wrongfully prosecuted so many working-class and, disproportionately, Black citizens tells its own story. Rather than wringing our hands at this injustice, we should be demanding action. There should be an immediate amnesty for those charged with breaking lockdown rules and their fines should be withdrawn. Those who have been made to pay often completely unaffordable sums should be reimbursed in full. The very people who designed the rules were able to shamelessly flout them while the state forced tens of thousands of often financially struggling people to open their wallets for lesser offences: this cannot stand. Pay them back, or tell the world loudly and proudly that British law exists to crack down on the poor and marginalised, while allowing the rich and powerful to run riot.

1/14/2022,"The decision not to prosecute a teenager accused of pushing a 13-year-old boy into a river was legally flawed and unreasonable or irrational, a court has heard. Christopher Kapessa drowned after he was allegedly pushed into the River Cynon in south Wales by a 14-year-old boy in July 2019. In July 2020 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that although there was evidence to support a prosecution for manslaughter, it had decided it was not in the public interest to do so for what it described as a “foolish prank”.  At a judicial review hearing in central London on Thursday, brought by Christopher’s mother, Alina Joseph, against the director of public prosecutions (DPP) for the refusal to bring charges, her counsel, Michael Mansfield QC, said prosecutors had misunderstood the culpability of the teenager and given his youth “undue weight”. He said the decision not to prosecute went against the CPS’s own guidance with respect to homicide cases, which states that “subject to sufficiency of evidence, a prosecution is almost certainly required”. In written submissions, Mansfield described it as an “unreasonable or irrational decision because any proper and correct consideration of the evidence and information in this case could only properly conclude that the public interest requires prosecution for this fatal offence”. He added: “Young age can never be a defence per se to an offence, and all the less so for a young killer, whose manslaughter robbed another young boy of his own life … The defendant has approached youthfulness on the part of an offender by an imbalanced approach that wrongly elevates youth above the loss of life, ie harm, from homicide. The proper approach would be to have those public interest factors tending against prosecution put to the court for consideration when sentence is passed.” After the CPS announced its decision not to prosecute, Joseph claimed it was because her son was black and accused South Wales police and the CPS of institutional racism. While Mansfield did not repeat those allegations, he said it was imperative that public trust and confidence be maintained in the police and criminal justice system “for all persons including minority ethnic communities”. A banner hung outside the Royal Courts of Justice, where the hearing took place, said: “Killed and then failed by state racism.” Mansfield told the court: “It has not been clarified or established why Christopher, who was black, was selected by the suspect.” The barrister told the court that there was a “preponderance of evidence” that the teenager who pushed Christopher knew he could not swim but that even if he did not know, it would not prevent a manslaughter conviction. He added: “There has been a failure to consider properly the aggravating factors in the conduct of the suspect. The selfish telling of lies, the failure to show remorse, and the failure to accept responsibility for his actions, are properly to be treated as aggravating factors of relevance and importance.” In his written submissions Duncan Penny QC, for the DPP, said the CPS decision-maker in the case had acted with “scrupulous fairness”. He said: “She identified the key factors, attached the appropriate weight to those factors and then balanced those key factors that came down in favour of a prosecution against those that did not.” Christopher’s case has been highlighted by Black Lives Matter protesters and 24 MPs signed an early day motion expressing alarm at the CPS decision not to prosecute.

1/14/2022,"Stephen Colbert attempted to sort through the bleak deja vu of Omicron winter in New York on Wednesday evening. “If this pandemic were a movie, it would be Tenet,” the Late Show host said. “It’s impossible to understand, and I just wish it would end, which turns out is the beginning.”  The host also reacted to a subtle shift in public health messaging in recent days, as the US reached record numbers of Covid infections: “They’re trying to make us get used to all of this,” Colbert noted. He pointed to testimony on Omicron’s transmissibility from the White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci on Tuesday: “Omicron will infect just about everybody.” “Do you hear that? Being attacked for two years has clearly broken Dr Fauci,” Colbert said, imitating the doctor: “Rip off your mask, go to hot yoga, on the way home tug a hobo – I don’t give a vaccinated crap. We’re all doomed.” Fauci also said that those who have been vaccinated will “very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well”. “There are certain things I don’t want to equivocate on,” Colbert responded. “My life is one of them. You don’t want to hear a skydiving instructor say, ‘Jump from the plane! You will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well.’” According to experts, unvaccinated people are 10 times likelier to be infected with Omicron and 20 times likelier to die. “They’re also 50 times likelier to start a fight with a Kroger employee because the Mexican food aisle is in Spanish,” Colbert quipped. On Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped a rare interview appearance by Donald Trump on a mainstream media network, the US national radio network NPR. “For some reason, Trump thought it would be a good idea to call into NPR,” Meyers explained, “where he seemed to be caught off-guard” when pressed about his 2020 election lies by host Steve Inskeep. “Instead of listening to Trump’s answers mouth agape with no pushback” a la the Fox & Friends hosts, “Inskeep came prepared with basic facts to debunk Trump’s claims, and Trump clearly had no idea how to handle it,” said Meyers. “For starters, he didn’t even seem to know the details about how the interview was going to work,” asking Inskeep at the start if the interview was live (it was pre-taped). “He’s a former president calling into a well-known news program and he acts like he just got stopped on the street by Jay Leno,” Meyers joked. The interview came to an abrupt end when Trump hung up as Inskeep pressed the former president on his lies about the 2020 election. “You know it’s bad when Donald Trump, who will drone on endlessly for as long as you let him, willingly ends an interview before it’s supposed to be over,” Meyers noted. “When these deranged lies are subjected to even a modicum of scrutiny they collapse because they’re absurd on their face.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also lamented “another virus” on the rise: “That big orange golfer who used to run the country.” In an interview with rightwing media company OAN, Trump confirmed he’d had the Covid booster and called Republican lawmakers who refuse to say they’ve been vaccinated “gutless”. It was a thinly veiled barb at Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, who stumbled over a question about his booster status on Fox News last weekend. DeSantis is expected to run for the Republican nomination for president in 2024, “and you know that makes Trump crazy”, said Kimmel. “Trump desperately wants credit for developing the vaccines, because he should want credit, but the dummies who follow him boo him when he says he got the vaccine. “And then you have characters like DeSantis who wants to have it both ways – he obviously got the booster but he doesn’t want to admit he got it,” Kimmel continued. “Which makes Trump, who did admit it, look like a wuss to the gators and chewing tobacco crowd. I mean, imagine being called gutless by Captain Bone Spurs.”",Arts/Culture,"Stephen Colbert on the pandemic: ‘If it were a movie, it would be Tenet’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/13/stephen-colbert-pandemic-tenet-trump-npr-late-show-recap
1/14/2022,"Do you have trouble falling asleep straight away or are you prone to waking up in the middle of the night? Of the many things that could be interrupting your restful slumber, caffeine is among the most likely culprits. Caffeine has a quarter life of 10 to 12 hours, meaning that if you have coffee to get through an early afternoon meeting, you could still have caffeine coursing through your system at midnight.  But as those who have ever tried cutting caffeine out entirely soon discover, the cure can be worse than the disease. Caffeine withdrawal can cause headaches for a week or more after, and that comes on top of the lethargy of no longer being able to indulge in your favourite pick-me-up. The solution is simple, although not always easy to stick to: no caffeine after midday. Of course a piccolo at 2pm will taste great, but you’ll be cursing when you can’t switch your brain off later. Even tea, or a coke – best avoid them all. Of course you’ll likely crash mid-afternoon. Have a piece of fruit. Or go for a run. But caffeine is not your friend. Did you know the uptake of caffeine was linked with the rise of capitalism and bosses squeezing more out of your work day?

1/14/2022,"Graham Slade says Point Lonsdale front beach was a site of many firsts: he was four years old when he first walked on to it, seven years old when he was given his first surfboard and a teenager when he took his first steps into adulthood on its sand. “As you go through life, everything happened at Lonsdale first,” Slade says. “You went out to a lot of parties in your late teens, getting towards 20 years old, and sampled a few things.  “My main addiction though was surfing, and I’m still pretty keen.” Looking back, the 69-year-old says that as the surfboards he rode went from cork to traditional longboards to modern fibreglass, he has watched the sand at Point Lonsdale wither. Over the years, as the swell has grown more powerful, the sand has washed away, leaving jagged rocks after storms. Now Slade is among residents who say authorities have a responsibility to rebuild beaches like Point Lonsdale, which have degraded after decades of mismanagement. “An analogy would be if a driver’s vehicle unintentionally strikes a parked car,” Slade says. “That driver is legally and morally responsible to pay for repairs to that car. It should be the same for the beach. “The damage was unintentional when they put the sea wall in. They thought they were doing good but didn’t know it would cause erosion. But it has.” What happened to Point Lonsdale is in many ways emblematic of what has happened to many other beaches around the country in that its degradation was the product of industrialisation, urbanisation and bad decisions made with the best intentions. It began nearly a century ago when local authorities built a seawall to protect buildings that had risen atop the dunes. Soon it quickly became clear the wall was causing the sand to be washed away and wooden groynes – long structures running perpendicular to the shore – were installed to hold the beach in place. They lasted until 1989 when they had worn away and were removed but not quickly replaced. Over the next nine years the sand on Point Lonsdale began to thin, a process that sped up in 2008 after a $969m project to deepen the Port Phillip Heads shipping channel to allow access for larger container ships. That work ripped out the natural reefs that provided Point Lonsdale beach some protection against the full weight of the ocean, causing the swell to grow more powerful and throwing it directly up the beach. James Cotton, from Save Point Lonsdale Front Beach, says residents have tried to work with the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning over the last six years to develop a solution but, at the last minute, the department balked. “All of a sudden they just decided they would just close their work on the matter,” Cotton says. “After a six-year consultation process they came back by email and said really sorry, there’s been a change in policy, we can no longer support any works in this area, case closed.” The abrupt about-face followed the introduction of the marine and coastal policy in 2020, which attempted a break from the past by preferring hands-off solutions to coastal management – rather than direct intervention. A spokesperson said the department was now seeking to work with natural processes and would consider re-nourishment programs “in the future”. “Any intervention in coastal environments can lead to negative impacts elsewhere,” it said. “We work with expert coastal engineers before choosing options to tackle erosion so we can avoid moving the problem elsewhere or causing more damage in the future.” But Cotton says while this is a good policy for untouched and healthy beaches, Point Lonsdale has “already been interfered with”, which created an obligation for authorities to address it. “The only reason we’re in this state is because first they put a sea wall in and then they blew up the reef,” Cotton says. “The environment’s already been altered but now they’re saying they can’t do anything about it for fear of altering the environment.” If the situation at Point Lonsdale shows how a beach can be lost – and the tensions created when people try to fix it – actually rebuilding it can be complicated. Ruth Reef, an associate professor with Monash University’s school of earth, atmosphere and environment, says beaches are fragile places, forever remaking themselves in response to subtle changes in the environment. With most sandy beaches in the world only having formed in the last 5,000 years as the oceans stabilised and the current sea level settled to a constant, no two are alike and all are precious. “They were a mountain once,” Reef says. “Think about the beach as a snaking conveyor belt of sand. It’s always exchanging sand. The conveyor belt connects between the land and the deep ocean. “A beach requires two things. First, a supply of sand, and second, waves gentle enough to keep it from being washed away.” Those natural beaches that ring 34,000km of Australian coastline largely owe their existence to erosion. Some began where rivers rose, as rain wore down mountains and the currents carried the sediment to the coast, softening it along the way. Others formed from material pulled by the wind from exposed cliff faces, which was carried up the coast until the sand could travel no further. A further group formed when waves broke down coral reefs or shell matter into fine, soft sand. If the relative geological youth and the delicate balance of forces needed to sustain a beach makes them special places, restoring them means either finding a way to soften the waves, or feeding fresh sand into the system – often at great cost. A good example is the hundreds of millions the South Australian government has spent each year to maintain Adelaide’s metropolitan beaches since 1971, when it was forced to intervene. Before this a chain of sea walls had been constructed along the coast, and infrastructure like jetties and boat harbours blocked the flow of sand along the coast. Adelaide is not the only city in the world to run similar programs. Tractors and bulldozers trundle out on to Venice’s Lido to repair the sands every spring, while Nice’s famous pebble beach was, at one point, being replenished every day. Even in Queensland authorities are in the process of building a 7.8km pipeline in the Gold Coast to recycle sand on its northern beaches. Without these sorts of re-nourishment programs, coastal engineer James Guy, who manages the South Australian government’s beach regeneration project, says there would simply be no beach. “Once you develop along the coastline, you are committing to management forever unless you a prepared to not have beaches,” Guy says. “We locked up sand beneath development and the reality is once we did that – and this is before coastal processes were understood – it may well have unknowingly committed society to managing a strip of beaches.” In other words: you break it, you bought it. The success of the program can be seen by work at South Australia’s West beach, which sits roughly in the middle of a beach system that stretches from the cliffs at the south of the Fleurieu Peninsula all the way north through to Outer Harbour. What exactly eroded West beach’s sand is hotly debated. The state government and environmental groups point to a long history of environmental mismanagement that killed the seagrass that held together sand bars and blocked the natural flow of sand northward along the coast – a process known as longshore drift. But John Dundon, from Save West Beach Sand, says the previous Labor government “deliberately sacrificed” the beach when it killed a plan to build a pipeline to recycle sand through the entire system due to costs. “West beach was cheap sand,” Dundon says. “They systematically mined and eroded it to feed beaches farther north.” Whatever the exact reason, a storm in 2016 hit West beach and cut 10 metres into the dunes, wiping away sand that did not return. A report by Danish Hydraulics Institute in 2017 found the government had underestimated the rate of erosion at West beach by a staggering amount. Today 500,000 cubic metres of sand will be trucked in from a quarry at Mount Compass to rebuild West Beach. Meanwhile, the South Australian government is looking to complete the pipeline to stop the sand vanishing once more. Though the work has proven controversial over concerns about the dunes, and there is more work to be done to redirect stormwater runoff, Dundon says it’s been a “joy” to see the beach return after a long fight by the community. “Humans destroyed West beach – they took away a beautiful coastal oasis and starved it and made it into nothing more than a rocky outcrop, with no beach for surf, and no place for the community,” Dundon says. “This goes back to the heart of the thing. We are custodians. We need to take care of the environment and foster it for future generations.”",News/Australia news,‘We are custodians’: the fights to save Australia’s eroding beaches,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/14/we-are-custodians-the-fights-to-save-australias-eroding-beaches
1/14/2022,"Right behind Sydney’s airport, Brighton Le Sands is indistinctive for a beach; the kind you’d drive past on your way to somewhere else. But one crucial geographic quirk sets it apart: it is the closest beach to people from western Sydney. That fact has turned its shore into a thriving scene, heaving with people on sunny days and warm nights. As an industrial port, mammoth cranes and stacks of shipping containers dominate half the curving bay’s horizon, but the beach itself is framed by palm trees. It’s not exactly a postcard Sydney view – but its convenience for those out west, the character and identity visitors bring to Brighton’s calm waters, and the acceptance they find, keeps people coming back.  On a humid and cloudy Sunday afternoon, Hassan pauses when asked why he likes to come to Brighton, taking long drags of his shisha and staring out at the ocean before answering. “I come all the way from Picton, nearly an hour-and-a-half drive … There’s just something different about it; you relax when you see the ocean,” he says. Hassan visits Brighton often, and sets up his own hookah, complete with his favourite flavour – double apple. “It’s the closest beach to us, and it’s got more of my community here compared to other beaches. I relax much more here,” he says. Anwar Elahmad agrees the beach’s proximity to the city’s west makes it a preferable destination for him and his family, who drive from Guildford. “It’s the M5, one way … all the way down. It’s easier than going to the other beaches in the eastern suburbs.” Elahmad, who has just finished praying with his friends, says while Brighton isn’t his favourite beach (“a one out of 10 compared to Coogee or Bronte”), pure beauty is not the only thing that matters. “It’s a bay! No waves, the water isn’t the cleanest, but I’m satisfied with one out of 10. I’m content and I’m comfortable. That plays a big part,” he says. “You don’t get looked at, you don’t get picked out, you don’t get profiled. Unfortunately, as Muslims, you do get that at other beaches.” Ibrahm Sabra comes to Brighton at least once a week, saying he loves the atmosphere. His friends prepare their jetski behind him. “I like bringing the jetski, [Brighton is] kid-friendly and it’s just beautiful. “It takes around half-an-hour for us to get here from home. I just feel like I’m at home here. It’s closer than other beaches. It’s central here, we bump into lots of friends and family – I love it.” Having a space like this is “essential for myself and for my family”, he says. As night descends, the number of people swimming dwindles but the walkways along the sand buzz. Something shifts in the night air. Hotted-up cars blare at the traffic lights, groups of teenagers strut along the promenade and families bring ice-creams to watch the sunset. Sarah Mazen, who is visiting from Melbourne, says she had to see the beach for herself. Everyone talks up the nightlife, she says. “I’ve heard about this place all over social media. I have another friend coming from Melbourne and we’re about to go pick her up, but thought we’d stop here first. “I can see how vibrant it is here, how alive it feels. We don’t have much of this in Melbourne.” Royce and Karina are locals, taking their dog for a walk along the beach. They love the suburb at this hour. “The nightlife is great, you can come out and everything is open. Other places shut at eight at night, everything is dead, but here it goes to midnight, people walking around, in the water, it’s nice to see.” Royce has lived in San Souci, a neighbouring suburb, for 24 years, and says much has changed in that time. “The footpath used to be garbage, you couldn’t ride your bike, it was never as packed, it was all a bit rundown. But life happened – and they’ve revamped the area, it’s so much better.” John is out celebrating his graduation from high school with his friends and says the beach attracts a certain type of fashion. “People come and dress up nice, drive their cars, enjoy their time. People make it like this; make it their home. “People are friendly here, it’s just nice walking around, its a nice experience.” Naz and Fatima have come to Brighton from Coogee, where their night began. “It was so boring!” Naz says of the eastern suburbs beach. “Here you have people walking past 24/7, you can have a laugh. You wouldn’t see a crowd like this in Coogee.” Fatima elaborates, saying many of the visitors to Brighton would feel out of place at other beaches. “There’s a lot of Muslim women in hijab here, and it’s good to see them in their element, not judged or stared at,” she says. “Out in the eastern suburbs, of course they’d be going to be looked at. They feel part of a community here.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I’m satisfied with a one out of 10’: the buzzing social scene of Sydney’s least-assuming beach,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/14/im-satisfied-with-a-one-out-of-10-the-buzzing-social-scene-of-sydneys-least-assuming-beach
1/14/2022,"Afeeling of pessimism and despair following the black summer bushfires that swept through Australia in 2019/2020 became the catalyst for one of the most unconventional and ambitious productions likely to be seen during this year’s Sydney festival. Like most arts organisations, Sydney-based physical theatre company Legs on the Wall has spent the better part of two years in hiatus.  After critically acclaimed seasons of Man with the Iron Neck (tackling the raw subject of suicide among First Nations men) across four major Australian festivals in 2018 and 2019, two national tours of the production came to an abrupt halt in early 2020 due to Covid-19. Legs on the Wall artistic director Joshua Thomson spent the downtime in introspective and emotional disquiet, struggling to also come to terms with the environmental devastation and national trauma of black summer, which claimed 18.6m hectares of land, destroyed almost 3,000 homes and claimed the lives of at least 34 people. “I felt moved, hopeless and maybe a bit angry … I just felt like there was nothing I could do to help,” Thomson says. “But then I started thinking about what I’m good at and how could I continue to push the conversation and the awareness around climate change. Then I started thinking about the opposite to fire – and that’s when the idea of ice came. “Australia is the driest continent on the Earth … and I wanted to put something fragile into that kind of hostile environment.” Staged across three days in January from Friday, Thomson’s Thaw will see three female artists performing consecutively on a 2.5 tonne block of ice suspended 20 metres above Sydney harbour, in a piece that runs for nine hours each day. The airborne iceberg melting in Sydney’s midsummer heat, a human figure precariously negotiating its slippery and ever-diminishing surface; a metaphor for the fragile and diminishing natural world melting under the burden of humanity. Cecily Hardy, Thaw’s creative producer, is the conduit between Thomson’s artistic concept and the logistics of the venture. It took about 2,700 litres of water to create each of the four icebergs (one was used for rehearsal), with each body of arctic blue-tinted water taking about 10 days to freeze in a custom-made $30,000 steel mould. The freezing process began in November. A crane positioned on the Sydney Opera House’s western boardwalk will suspend a fresh 2.5 tonne iceberg over the harbour each morning on the 14, 15 and 16 January. Each day, Isabel Estrella, Vicki Van Hout and Victoria Hunt (the latter two are First Nations artists both over the age of 50) will spend a three-hour shift performing on top of the iceberg. The choreography has been co-devised by the performers and Thomson, backed by an original score by Alaska composer, sound artist and eco-acoustician Matthew Burtner, who is also the director of Alaska’s environmental arts non-profit organisation, EcoSono. How long will it take the iceberg to melt each day? That, says Hardy, is the million-dollar question. Some weather conditions will cause the ice to melt more rapidly than others, possibly dissolving the iceberg by more than 50% over the nine-hour performance time. “Our testing showed the combination of weather that made the most erosion on the iceberg was wind and sun together,” says Hardy, who fondly refers to her icebergs as “she”. “Of course the heat melts her, but it’s the wind that makes that surface melt away more quickly. Surprisingly she melts up quite a bit slower than you would imagine when she’s just [exposed to] direct sun on a still day. “That’s part of the whole point: that some days after a long day, she might look quite different to what she ended up looking like the day before depending on the weather, and that in itself is quite exciting.” Working on a heritage site that can be visited by thousands of people in a single day has presented a unique set of occupational health and safety challenges, Hardy says. There were many hurdles that the company – working in tandem with Sydney Opera House management, the crane company, riggers and engineers – had to resolve, which were then independently peer-assessed to ensure maximum safety. “There’s so many layers of consideration, planning and technology that have gone into what looks like a quite simple and beautiful thing,” Hardy says. Aside from the opera house forecourt, the three performances of Thaw will be visible from the Cahill Expressway, Circular Quay, the MCA and international passenger terminal, and Lavender Bay, along with myriad other vantage points clustered around the Sydney harbour waterfront. The performances will also be in full view of Kirribilli House, the secondary official residence of Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison, who – in the wake of Cop26 – has become internationally infamous for his inaction on climate change. Thomson says Thaw is undeniably political but not in a didactic sense. “There’s an opportunity and a responsibility for this work to say something … and yes, it has an element of spectacle,” he says. “But hopefully, through the spectacle and the scale, we will bring people in, capture the minds of people in their wonder and deliver this message through a moment of thought, not a slap in the face.” Thaw will be performed over Sydney harbour next to the Sydney Opera House from 14-16 January and livestreamed as part of Sydney festival’s At Home digital program and on Sydney Opera House’s Stream platform. Saturday’s entire performance can be viewed as a live video feed on 15 January from 10am to 8.30pm",Arts/Culture,Three women are dancing on an iceberg in the sky.

1/14/2022,"What is extraordinary about the last two weeks in Australia is not only the large numbers of people infected with Covid but the psychological volte-face required to withstand this new reality. The volte-face is this: going from being able to name or be aware of individual cases in the community (barbecue guy, the limo guy, the removalists) to almost everyone you know seeming to have it all at once. The disorientation is supreme. We’ve gone from nationwide surveillance, policing, punishment and public shaming in the media for having it, to this; the government saying it’s OK to go to work and be a close contact, to being sick and not being able to get tested, to shops and businesses shut because so many staff are sick, to supply chains being disrupted because of Covid. Quite suddenly we are living in a completely different reality from the previous two years.  The whiplash is intense. It’s not just that there is more virus around, but we are told we have to think differently about this wave. As a result, we are having to rewire our psychological landscape on the fly, and are left scrambling for a new set of rules. But these rules are essentially private, particular, based on individual levels of comfort (do I sit indoors at the cafe, attend the wedding, self-isolate if I am ill but can’t get tested?). After two years of being told what to do, we are on our own. Even among groups of friends there are cracks appearing between those comfortable with being in the community and those who are essentially going back into lockdown this summer. Organising social events is a nightmare (that is, if you can find venues that are open), where people’s risk levels are exposed and not everyone is on the same page. Do you sit this summer out trying to keep yourself and others safe or do you try and reclaim your life back after years of being shut in? And what about that feeling you get of being judged no matter what your personal decisions around safety may be? When we look back, I suspect for many people it will be this summer they found to be the most difficult. Everything feels topsy-turvy, strange and stressful. Take where I am holidaying right now: Port Fairy, on the south-west coast of Victoria – a place I have been visiting for decades. I have never seen it like this. Last week, in the peak of tourist season, the majority of food outlets including three pubs were shut. Some of the remaining cafes that were open were doing takeaway only. The only supermarket in town was on reduced hours. The signs on the shuttered windows said a mixture of things: closed because there was not enough staff, closed because staff were awaiting test results, and in the cases of places shutting early, closed because they had run out of food. Tourists were just walking up and down the street, looking confused. There was nothing open. Usually in peak holiday season, most of the businesses in town make money that takes them through a more lean, bleak winter. And if you should wake up with a scratchy throat, it’s impossible to find a rapid antigen test here, and you have to drive to the next town for a PCR test and a long queue. During the course of the pandemic, there have been Covid cases in south-west Victoria, but nothing like this. You could see it dribbling down the Princess Highway from Melbourne during the second and third waves. But this wave has struck the entire town like a tsunami. We have shown that we are nothing if not adaptable over the last two years – but I have seen nothing from the politicians acknowledging that this part of the journey is going to be challenging for many. Many Australians got really scared for the better part of two years and the government and the media didn’t let up when it came to hammering in the fear. The fear isn’t going to go away overnight just because many people experience the virus in its mild form. You can’t freak people out for that long and that hard without expecting some residual traces of that fear to remain in the system. Predicting anything in this pandemic has been impossible, but I do sense one thing: after the fear subsides, there will be anger.

1/14/2022,"When Jane* was told her regular psychiatry appointments would no longer be covered under Medicare’s telehealth provisions, the news was so distressing she ended up being hospitalised. “I had a crisis, and took an accidental overdose of my antidepressant,” she said. “I was taken by ambulance to casualty and wasted the night and most of Sunday [in hospital].”  Byrne lives in Nowra, a two-and-a-half hour drive south of Sydney in the Shoalhaven, a coastal region of New South Wales with limited access to specialised mental healthcare. When telehealth consultations were drastically expanded in March 2020, Jane was able to receive regular, bulk-billed sessions with a mental health nurse, working alongside a doctor at a Sydney-based private clinic. But from 1 January, the federal government removed a 50% loading for some rural psychiatric services, meaning a string of consultation providers were no longer able to bulk-bill their items. Providers are now faced with the option to either absorb the costs themselves or pass the load on to their patients, many of whom have limited financial means and struggle to pay gap fees. Jane said the changes had been “devastating”. “These telehealth sessions have become a lifesaver,” she said. “I didn’t have to drive to Shellharbour and waste at least half a day, and I wouldn’t have been able to afford the same amount of consultations as I had with telehealth.” Those working within the mental health system told Guardian Australia they had been “blindsided” by the changes, which became public just weeks before coming into effect. On 13 December, the federal health department announced $106m to make telehealth a permanent fixture of primary healthcare. But three days later, under subsequent changes to the Medical Benefits Scheme (MBS), 27 items were amended and 128 were scrapped, including item 288 for video psychiatric consultations through GP referrals. Telephone access to an initial consultation with a psychiatrist was also removed, as was subsequent access to psychiatric consultations lasting more than 45 minutes. Psychiatrist-provided psychotherapy telephone consultations typically require at least a 50-minute session. Guardian Australia revealed how other changes, including the removal of phone consultations in place of video conferencing, would affect patients, particularly those with cancer. Credentialed mental health nurse at Rural Outreach Mental Health Service, Grahame Gee, said he’d already had clients cancelling appointments in the new year because they couldn’t afford the fees. “The service providers are doing their best to provide continuity of care but losing one-third of their income at very short notice will make it very difficult,” he said. “A lot of the people I see have long-term complex mental health issues, they’re financially strapped, some of them might not be able to work because of their mental health issues … for them, it’s a case of deciding do I have ongoing support from a psychiatrist or do I pay for rent and food on the table? “This is the dilemma … I’ve had patients who with the support and help of a psychiatrist can get back on the road to recovery.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) has written to the minister for health and aged care, Greg Hunt, calling for urgent changes to the new arrangements. The RANZCP president, associate professor Vinay Lakra, said making telehealth a more permanent feature of the health system considerably improved access to care but “serious gaps” needed to be addressed. “The removal of item 288 is already having a devastating impact on access and affordability to psychiatric services for patients,” she said. ‘The need for a more Covid-safe capacity to ensure continuity of care between patients and psychiatrists in private hospital settings has probably never been as crucial as it is now.” The president of the National Association of Practising Psychiatrists (NAPP), Dr Philip Morris, said the removal of the telehealth loading effectively ceased bulk-billed psychiatric consultations for patients in regional and rural areas, while removing telephone consultations would further lock at-risk patients out of the system. People with complex histories of trauma or mental health needs have displayed a preference for telephone consultations above video, and others lack reliable internet, data or access to smartphones with video capabilities. Morris is calling on the federal government to return the 288 item number for telehealth consultations, and reintroduce item 319, that provides a telephone option for consultations that last more than 45 minutes. “We don’t want to disadvantage people in rural, remote and regional areas who have poor access to internet and other services, and we don’t want to disadvantage people who … can’t pay for internet services,” Morris said. The Australian Association of Psychologists Inc executive director, Tegan Carrison, said AAPi wasn’t consulted prior to the changes coming into effect “or provided warning to sufficiently plan for the impact on client care”. “AAPi has consistently lobbied for more mental health funding such as rural loading and increased rebates – particularly in regional and rural areas to address the access and affordability issues,” she said. “Now is the time we need to increase access, not reduce it.” A spokesperson for the Department of Health said the changes to telehealth reflected recommendations by the MBS Review Taskforce and had been the subject of “extensive and broad consultation” with stakeholders. “The ongoing telehealth arrangements modernise and embed permanent access to all Australians making service delivery more flexible,” they said. “This is about improving access to video and telephone services provided by GPs, medical specialists and other health professionals that reflect clinical best practice.” The spokesperson said the 50% loading item for 288 was initially introduced in 2011 to encourage medical specialists to take up video consults, addressing geographical barriers to specialist care. “The uptake of video and telephone services since the introduction of universal telehealth in March 2020 demonstrates that these incentives are no longer needed,” they said. *The Guardian has chosen not to use her full name Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",News/Australia news,‘Devastating’ cuts to Medicare telehealth leave rural psychiatric patients in the lurch,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/14/devastating-cuts-to-medicare-telehealth-leave-rural-psychiatric-patients-in-the-lurch
1/14/2022,"The impact of Covid-19 on supply chains has begun to disrupt goods needed for PCR testing, forcing the closure of clinics in one jurisdiction. The highly-contagious Omicron variant has caused widespread staff shortages and a “crisis” in transport and other supply chain businesses, leading to shortages at supermarkets, retailers and other key industries.  The supply chain issues are so severe that the Australian Capital Territory on Wednesday announced it was closing three testing clinics – a significant chunk of its testing capacity – until Monday. The government said the closures were due to “unavoidable supply issues” experienced by Capital Pathology, part of the Sonic Healthcare pathology giant. The testing supplies ordered by Capital Pathology were “unable to be delivered to the ACT within the expected timeframe due to the impacts of Covid-19 on the supply chain”. “The ACT, like all jurisdictions, is working hard to manage its testing supplies, including reagents and consumables, which are in high demand across the country,” a spokesperson for ACT Health said. “The high demand for these items has been exacerbated by supply chain issues that have also been affecting other industries.” Unlike rapid tests, Australia is not currently experiencing a shortage in supplies of PCR consumables themselves. NSW, Victoria, and Queensland all confirmed that, despite huge demand, they have adequate stocks of PCR testing equipment. But NSW Health said the demand on PCR testing in the state was “enormous” and the situation was “evolving”. The high number of positive PCR tests means laboratories need to change to a more time-consuming approach to confirm each sample, a spokesperson said. Queensland Health said it had sufficient stock of test kits “to maintain current capacity”. It said it had created a strategic reserve and sourced testing instruments from a number of vendors to lessen the risk of supply shortages. “Like all jurisdictions across Australia, Queensland’s public and private testing network has been placed under significant pressure by the surge in Omicron cases and the subsequent national shortage in some PCR testing supplies,” a spokesperson said. The Morrison government has attempted to relieve pressure on supply chains by scrapping isolation requirements for close contacts of Covid cases employed in critical supply chains. Those rules were extended from the food supply sector to other industries on Thursday, including to all transport, freight and logistics workers. Workers who are a close contact of a positive Covid case will no longer have to isolate if they return a negative rapid antigen test result. “The more you try to protect your hospital system, the more people you are taking out of work, which disrupts supply chains,” Morrison said. “This is a very delicate balance that needs to be constantly recalibrated.” But Labor criticised the changes, saying they will mean nothing without greater supply of rapid tests. “These changes to isolation arrangements won’t amount to a hill of beans if Scott Morrison doesn’t fix the mess he has created around rapid tests,” the shadow health minister, Mark Butler, said. “That is clear. Business, trade unions, have made that clear. All of these changes will end up being academic if workers and businesses can’t get access to rapid tests and can’t get that access free of charge.”",News/Australia news,Pressure grows on Australia’s PCR testing amid supply chain issues and Omicron case surge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/14/pressure-grows-on-australias-pcr-testing-amid-supply-chain-issues-and-omicron-case-surge
1/14/2022,"The end of last year was instructive for retailers. The months of October to December have traditionally been retail’s golden quarter, covering the shopping periods of Black Friday and Christmas. But due to the pandemic, the last two golden quarters have been like no other. As well as facing a raft of new practical issues when it came to shopping, consumers and merchants alike re-evaluated how they wanted to live, work and shop in the future. There are valuable lessons for merchants to learn from the experience. Rob Cameron, CEO of Barclaycard Business, is ideally placed to offer insights into the consumer trends that have emerged and how they will continue to evolve.  Digital is here to stayThe biggest retail trend of the past 18 months has been the huge conversion to digital. “I’ve heard people say it moved us up five years,” says Cameron. “But it’s more than that.” In fact, according to a report by PwC, we saw “seven years of online growth in seven weeks”. The widespread closure of physical stores – and health concerns around using those that remained open – went beyond just accelerating the growth of e-commerce by changing the behaviour of consumers who were otherwise dragging their heels with the move to digital. “There was a set of the population who were never going to order online groceries, groups who were never going to get used to shopping online, and those who are used to using cash,” says Cameron. “But some changes that were brought about during the pandemic lasted long enough to permanently change behaviour. “It has structurally changed how consumers will shop, made them more digitally savvy, more aware of their online options.” Contactless payment is essentialNow more digitally savvy consumers increasingly expect a seamless experience and frictionless transactions – and retailers who are not agile enough to respond will lose out. According to a 2020 report by Barclaycard Business, 58% of UK consumers will abandon a purchase if the online checkout process is complicated, while 44% will ditch buying something if they’re not able to use their preferred payment method. The demand for a seamless experience when paying, and for more payment options, extends to bricks and mortar retail, too. Contactless payments – which were introduced in the UK by Barclaycard in 2007 – have soared since spring 2020, accounting for 80% of eligible consumer transactions up to the value of £45 passing through the Barclaycard payment system. But why is contactless so popular? Well, it offers faster transactions as well as being more hygienic – crucial during the height of the pandemic. As Cameron points out, tapping a card is “better than touching a physical pin pad after 50 people before you” – despite best efforts to keep card readers clean, it gives customers peace of mind. Cameron is encouraging retailers to embrace the higher contactless payment limit of £100 that replaced the £45 limit. “It’s a great opportunity to take friction out of the purchase experience,” he says. This is especially the case in busy stores where queues can quickly build up – contactless payments are, on average, seven seconds faster compared with chip and pin and 15 seconds faster compared with cash. Imagine it from a customer’s perspective: “The faster that line moves through, the more likely you are to have a good experience and want to come back.” Speed at the checkout will often avoid shoppers going elsewhere. Offer payment choices at checkoutContactless is not the only payment technology that has become more important since the pandemic began. “What we’ve seen is that merchants and consumers want choice at the checkout,” says Cameron. “And open banking is one of the choices.” Open banking offers benefits to both parties in a transaction. It’s essentially akin to a customer transferring the money directly from their current account, which provides potential savings to merchants and offers the consumer more protection than a bank transfer. “You don’t have to exchange sort code and account details,” says Cameron, and the consumer protection levels are similar to those governing payments by card. Barclaycard’s open banking system is called Barclays Bank Pay, which was designed in partnership with a group of diverse UK merchants and through customer testing – the first merchants are just starting to turn it on. Cameron explains: “There’s an element of consumer protection if a retailer becomes insolvent and does not fulfil the order.” Understand the benefits for your businessFor the merchant, the rewards for open banking are even greater. Using this system, businesses avoid card processing fees, which makes a noticeable difference to margins, particularly on big-ticket items. “In larger transaction size, there is a price advantage to the retailer,” says Cameron. “[It’s a] lower-cost payment method that offers a robust experience.” The boom in e-commerce that was accelerated by the pandemic encouraged shrewd retailers to explore different payment choices. “Merchants have become a lot savvier. With so much business moving online, they started looking at their checkout pages and really optimising,” says Cameron. “They’re also now taking into account cost and conversion rates.” The result is a rise in the number of retailers accepting digital wallets as a payment method. “We’ve seen Apple Pay, in particular, grow in leaps and bounds from a lower base than some of the other more established wallets,” says Cameron. “It has grown quickly because there’s no cost to retailers. “Consumers will notice they’re increasingly being offered the option of Apple Pay or Google Pay, and that’s because retailers realise they deliver a great customer experience, and are no more expensive to them than accepting a card payment.” Create a bridge between online and in-storeRetailers can accept digital wallets for payments online and in-store. Finding more ways to link these spheres is “definitely a trend”, says Cameron. “That bridging is going to be really critical for smart retailers.” Rather than treating digital and physical as separate siloes, merchants who operate in the two environments “need [solutions] for encouraging customers to remain loyal by opting for the omnichannel experience”, he continues. “Their most profitable customers will shop through both. Click and collect is a terrific way for retailers to get consumers that understand their website and web inventory to then go into the store and experience the store environment and the merchandising in the store, because they can attract different elements of spend.” To create this bridge, retailers need data – and data is something that Barclaycard Business can provide. “Our access to data is unique in the market,” says Cameron, attributing the company’s success in the payments field to “having great technical capabilities in combination with our data to optimise transactions. We have this amazing pool of data as a result of being the largest payment processor in the country.” Indeed, Barclaycard processes £1 in every £3 spent on cards in the UK. Meanwhile, the number of payments via Barclaycard on Black Friday last year were up by 23% between midnight and 5pm compared with the same period in 2020, and up 2.4% on 2019. The kinds of insights that can be gleaned from these volumes are increasingly essential to give retailers the edge they need in a world where retail norms are changing so rapidly.

1/14/2022,"The retail industry has undergone a radical transformation. Even before the Covid pandemic, the shift to e-commerce was completely reshaping how the industry operates and how customers shop. But lockdowns made these shifts more rapid and seismic, forcing businesses and consumers to shop online at record levels. The pandemic also expedited the adoption of in-store contactless payments. Research from UK Finance, which represents the banking and finance industry, found that 27% of all payments in 2020 were contactless, up from 7% five years ago.  While people have been talking about the shift to e-commerce for decades, we are now getting a much more definitive and enduring sense of what that transformation actually looks like, and what it means for retail businesses. “Finally, cash is no longer king,” says Jacob Rider, senior programme manager at Projective, a financial business, technology and innovation consulting firm. “Notes and coins went out of widespread use during the pandemic, while payments innovation in the contactless space – and the relaxing of regulations allowing the upping of limits – means digital and contactless payment with card or phone, or wear[able] tech, is now the preferred method of payment for many.” This means that trust is now of paramount importance – for both retailers and consumers alike. “Businesses are frantically working on recovering from the pandemic disruption, and they need to instil trust,” says Harshna Cayley, managing director, gateway products at Barclaycard Business. “Comfort and security is top of mind for a range of businesses, whether large or small.” Another effect of these trends is the way physical and online retail shopping have increasingly blended into one experience. However customers choose to shop, they expect the benefits of both approaches. For instance, some might wish to order online and then pick up in store, or they want to try out products in store and then have the purchase fulfilled online. Alternatively, they might expect their in-person shopping experiences to be more personalised. Retailers have often found themselves having to shapeshift in response to this demand for seamlessness and ease – and key to this are so-called omnichannel payments systems, which allow retailers to offer near-frictionless online payments regardless of whether customers are shopping in person, online or via mobile. Analysts suggest that the ability to offer frictionless payments is critical in business. “A flawless digital experience is now required to compete,” says Rider. “Brands need to innovate again if they want a customer payments experience advantage.” For example, regardless of how smoothly a customer progresses on their e-commerce purchasing journey – browsing, comparing and choosing an item – it is likely to come to a shuddering halt if the payment experience is challenging. According to Barclaycard research, £39bn worth of online shopping baskets have been abandoned since the start of the pandemic. Typical reasons for customers abandoning their cart include delivery fees, concerns about cybersecurity, and the absence of their chosen payment method. These stats don’t surprise Nick Maynard, head of research at Juniper Research, which specialises in financial and payment technologies. “Generally, friction is the main reason for cart abandonment,” he says. “This can come in many shapes or forms, including the inability to use a preferred payment method, poor design, or onerous security steps.” According to Cayley, a robust payment gateway is crucial for online retailers. A payment gateway is essentially a communication layer that sends payment information securely from the acquirer to the customer’s issuing bank, and back again. “Barclaycard payment gateway seamlessly connects the customer’s website with our payment system,” she says. “Then it securely captures and encrypts transactions, passing the necessary information between the end customer, the merchant, and the acquiring bank.” She notes that Barclaycard payment gateway is easy to integrate and scales depending on business needs, adding that it can improve the customer experience while helping companies comply with regulations and meet their legal obligations. Recent global events have brought into focus other shifts in the e-commerce landscape, such as the entry of more manufacturers into the direct-to-consumer retail space. Likewise, international sales have become an increasingly important way for retailers to plug the gaps left by supply chain problems and the decline of bricks and mortar trading. In a sense, omnichannel payments are evolving into omnipresent experiences and, as such, we can expect further rapid developments in this space, according to Jeroen Hölscher, head of global payments and cards practice at Capgemini, an IT services and consulting company. “Customers and businesses are undergoing a radical shift to digital wallets, mobile payments, virtual cards and other advanced payment solutions, which offer feature-rich, hyper-personalised digital payments experience,” he says. “Already, digital wallets are one of the most preferred payment methods for e-commerce purchases. Global e-commerce market sales are predicted to surpass $7tn (£5tn) by 2024, and digital wallets are expected to account for more than 50% of all the e-commerce payments.” More recently, e-commerce merchants were once again buoyed up by Black Friday last year, with the number of payments made via Barclaycard up by 23% between midnight and 5pm compared with the same period in 2020, and up 2.4% on 2019. “The prize for retailers is huge, with the bounce-back of the economy and consumers looking to spend,” says Cayley. “There is a massive opportunity to drive e-commerce.” Find out how your business can benefit from quick and frictionless online payments here",Retail reimagined,‘Cash is no longer king’: the rapid shift to e-commerce,https://www.theguardian.com/retail-reimagined/2022/jan/13/cash-is-no-longer-king-the-rapid-shift-to-e-commerce
1/14/2022,"Some people refer to it as the “new flex”. Others liken it to “shapeshifting”. Whatever you call it, the retail industry has had to take the standard notions of business agility to a whole new level – with many having to reinvent themselves virtually overnight as a result of the lockdowns. At the start of a new year, how can businesses capitalise on what they’ve learned? In an era where change often feels like it’s the only constant, retailers have come to realise that they require more resilient systems that enable their organisations to shapeshift without unravelling – whether it’s accelerating their digital transformation, adopting rapidly scalable logistics, flicking between local and global sales, or offering goods and services across different platforms in-person or digitally. For instance, having access to a mixture of small and large suppliers means businesses can be more responsive to changes in supply and demand. Likewise, having a robust and flexible payment system is essential.  “[During the pandemic], we saw unprecedented change for our businesses, and many of them have had to evolve their business models significantly to continue to survive,” says Linda Weston, head of core product at Barclaycard Business. “For many customers, that has been about transitioning their businesses from being bricks and mortar, face-to-face type organisations to transacting more in a digital environment.” She notes that these transformations aren’t just about striving to maintain revenues in the midst of a crisis, but also about growing your customer base. Thanks to the acceleration of e-commerce, retailers have been able to look beyond their prior horizons, entering overseas markets and expanding into new territories. “There has been a huge growth of businesses moving online and also looking to attract new customers outside of their existing customer base – whether that’s different sectors or different geographies,” says Weston. “It can be a real eye-opener once you’re in that e-commerce environment. Especially if you sell something unique, you can attract customers from such a broad demographic, and the world is your oyster.” Expanding horizons and upping your online gameSmall- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, have much to gain from upping their online game. “Business owners have realised that generating an e-commerce business is easier than they thought, and it allows them to consider their cross-border capability,” says Weston. However, while it’s exciting to realise the new possibilities and potentials of cross-border e-commerce trade, it can be perilous without good advice and knowhow. Nick Maynard, head of research at financial and payment technologies analysts Juniper Research, urges those making the leap to cross-border trading to “take the time to understand their target markets”. He says: “Payment methods vary drastically across different geographies, so ensuring that they accept the methods popular in these areas is essential. “Also, an understanding of fraud trends will ensure that sellers can mitigate the most common fraud methods in the target market. A robust gateway with local experience can help resolve these issues and is increasingly vital as e-commerce becomes more globalised.” Mastering foreign exchange and improving transparencyThe UK e-commerce trade association IMRG reported a 57% year-on-year increase in outbound e-commerce sales from the UK in 2020. But it can be all too easy for businesses to lose revenue from cross-border card payments because of currency fluctuations. To assist, Barclaycard Business has introduced Multicurrency: an integrated foreign exchange (FX) solution that enables customers to accept payments quickly and efficiently in more than 100 currencies. “One of the key things businesses need to manage if they are selling abroad is currency fluctuation, so they don’t end up out of pocket,” says Weston. “If the FX suddenly changes, they could potentially be operating at a loss. “Barclaycard Multicurrency provides our customers, all of whom depend on cashflow, with greater financial certainty. For example, it allows them to accept payments in the cardholder’s local currency and settle in pound sterling. Moreover, they can fix the exchange rate for one or seven days, so they have clarity of what funds they will receive for sales and adjust their price accordingly.” Weston points out that Barclaycard Multicurrency doesn’t require any additional integration on the merchant’s side and says that Barclaycard payment gateway customers could also take advantage of e-commerce dynamic currency conversion (eDDC). This product enables purchasers with cards issued overseas to choose whether they’d prefer to pay you in their local currency – with the listed price automatically applying relevant foreign exchange rates and fees. “Transparency for online consumers is hugely important,” Weston adds. “The earlier you can give transparency of the transaction cost in the customer checkout journey, the higher the conversion rate.” In a world where businesses use both bricks and clicks – and also need to shapeshift to keep pace with change and consumer expectations – offering transparency and having the confidence of an innovative, trusted and secure payment partner such as Barclaycard is business-critical.
