12/24/2021," When I say I missed the cinema, specifically I meant I miss seeing musicals on the big screen. While Jon M Chu’s In the Heights was made before the pandemic, his commitment to the supremacy of the production number delivered what our eyes were craving. Naturally, the film opens up the musical’s theatre staging, and it opens with a vast ensemble song of escalating excess, but it’s the 96,000 routine, about a third of the way in, which made the biggest splash and proved the director’s commitment to Technicolor extravagance by way of Busby Berkeley, aqua aerobics and gurning contortionists. Aptly, it’s a song about bragging and wish-fulfilment, in which the cast speculate on how they’d spend a lottery windfall. And for a song about big numbers, the scale is as massive as it ought to be: bikini overkill. It’s a little daft, sure, but so exuberant, you’ll grin all the way through – even at the goofy graffiti effects. Pamela Hutchinson “When did you all become such disappointments?” So asks the elegantly dressed Alberto, one of the elders of the extended Schisa family, as they dine al fresco on a gorgeous Neapolitan afternoon in Paolo Sorrentino’s winsome cine-memoir The Hand of God. Their summit is one of glorious ridicule as they mock the angry grandma who repulsively sucks on a fat lump of cheese while wearing a gaudy fur coat, chuckle as a rotund Aunt gripes “my spleen is acting up”, and roll their eyes at a crooked cousin too stupid to steal anything but watermelons. Explosive laughter comes when the morbidly obese sister brings her new beau, who introduces himself through a robotic electrolarynx. And yet this garishly-shot parade of cinematic invective, peppered with hearty “va fongool!”s, is awash, somehow, in the glow of nostalgic, familial love. To extract warmth from cruelty is a movie-making miracle. Jordan Hoffman About halfway through Edgar Wright’s cautionary tale about the hazards of escapism, the dream of young Eloise – to travel in sleep back to 60s London as bewitching it-girl Sandie – morphs into a nightmare. Though in this dizzying montage, it’s more like a good trip gone bad; Sandie’s yanked out of her bed by her boyfriend turned pimp with a bark of “everyone’s waiting for you”, a cruel inversion of the beckoning Petula Clark lyric sung a few scenes prior, and suddenly she’s at a club bathed in rainbow psychedelia. In time with the Walker Brothers’ cover of Land of 1,000 Dances, she whirls through a series of reluctant dates with oily clients, taking the edge off by getting progressively drunker until she’s cackling at their stock line about how lovely her name is. They don’t really care, assigning her a persona of their choosing, another dark play on the desire to be someone else she expressed before. The lyrics turn into mocking jeers, their exhortations to do the Watusi or Mashed Potato now demands from cruel men for her to dance to their liking. All she can do is get lost in the song. Charles Bramesco In a year of truly weird sex in movies (singing cunnilingus, oral period sex, sex with cars and Jesus figurines), the hottest scene of all may have been one without intercourse. Julie (Renate Reinsve, Cannes’ best actress winner) is flitting through careers and men, waiting for something to happen, as she approaches 30. One evening, walking home through luminous Oslo, she happens upon a wedding party, where she helps herself to too many drinks and chats up a tall, attractive stranger (Herbert Nordrum). What follows is 10 minutes of one of the most disarmingly romantic set pieces this side of Four Weddings and a Funeral and a masterclass in chemistry. With both happy in relationships and loath to cheat, they insist nothing can happen. But in various dim nooks around the party, they engage in a captivatingly sexy game of Is This Cheating?, involving biting, smelling armpits, shotgun smoking and peeing in front of each other (hotter than it sounds). As the sun rises, they say goodbye, positive they didn’t transgress – just as we’re certain it’s the beginning of a transformative romance. Lisa Wong Macabasco Billie Eilish is at Coachella. She’s watching Ariana Grande, minding her own business, when a man in a baseball cap and medical mask approaches her. She recoils, keeping her distance. He holds her gaze, and she offers a shy, stressed wave. He opens his arms for a hug, and after taking a minute to gather herself, she eventually receives the embrace. The man is veteran teen idol Justin Bieber. Caught on camera in RJ Cutter’s masterful fly-on-the-wall rock doc, it’s an extraordinary moment that feels like lightning in a bottle. He strokes her hair as she weeps uncontrollably, face pressed into his chest. “He just stood there and looked at me WITH HIS EYES,” sobs Eilish, reliving the experience in the car on the way home. “You know exactly how it feels to be him in that situation,” replies her brother, Finneas. The film is a snapshot of the planet’s biggest pop star as her fame is cresting; the scene draws a clever parallel with Bieber, the object of her own fandom. Simran Hans At first glance, Hulu’s Plan B could easily be confused with last year’s Unpregnant – both films follow two inseparable best female friends on hijinks-filled road trips for reproductive healthcare denied to them by real-life restrictions. But I knew Plan B, directed by Natalie Morales and written by Prathi Srinivasan and Joshua Levy, was more than a retread of Unpregnant in the film’s first act, when firecracker Lupe (Victoria Moroles) convinces the inexperienced, tightly-wound Sunny (Kuhoo Verma) to host a party as a scheme to court her crush. That plan goes bust, of course, and Sunny instead ends up in a bathroom with Kyle (Mason Cook), a dorky, ultra-Christian classmate. Over the course of four and a half minutes, Plan B captures with cringeworthy precision an under-represented teenage girl experience: first-time sex that is not traumatic or revelatory, but boring – anti-climactic, incidental, very brief, unworthy of the hype. Verma and Cook hit all the humbling notes: impulsive lust, disillusionment (theres’s a Squatty Potty involved), shock, shame. It’s an endearing, searing and hilarious ride, whose stressful consequences for Sunny only casts the increasingly dystopian nightmare of US reproductive rights in starker relief. Adrian Horton You can never anticipate how any movie is going to open, but there was no throat-clearing quite like Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar, which starts with a paperboy rolling through a middle American suburb on his bike, slinging deliveries while lip-synching to the 1980 Barbra Streisand-Barry Gibb duet Guilty. Why that song? It’s not connected to the period or the themes of the film that follows, such as they are, but it nonetheless seems like an ideal primer, suggestive of both the culotte-and-casserole souls of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo’s Nebraskan adventurers and the random battiness of the film’s delightfully offbeat sense of humor. Later in the film, when Wiig and Mumolo spend an entire plane ride talking up an imaginary perfect woman named Trish or Jamie Dornan launches into an impromptu beachside song-and-dance numbers, we can’t say we weren’t prepared for odd things to happen. Scott Tobias Few film-makers put together moments that hit on multiple levels like Paul Thomas Anderson. The dude rocks images that can simultaneously move the plot forward, deliver a symbolic punchline and do a number on our emotions. Licorice Pizza’s downhill sequence – peak cinema in 2021 – is just the latest example. That’s when the adult protagonist in Anderson’s 1973 set coming-of-age comedy, Alana (Alana Haim), steers a U-Haul with an empty gas tank in reverse down the Hollywood Hills. It’s a breathtaking stunt that’s also devastating for Alana. She’s a beguiling young woman whose life was stalled working a job to nowhere. And then she found some forward momentum when meeting Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman), a 15-year-old googly-eyed go-getter. But the high of their relationship, and all its youthful recklessness, is wearing thin when they hop in that truck and let gravity drag them backwards. Licorice Pizza has a few moments when Alana catches her own reflection and reassesses. Here we see her face in a riveting close-up of the driver’s side mirror, struck with fear and melancholy as the road behind her comes closing in. Radheyan Simonpillai There’s been a strange reticence to much of the writing about Jane Campion’s magnetic Oscar-buzzed comeback. Critics have praised and pored over its themes of masculinity and a loose definition of repression, but most have been too coy to discuss how overwhelmingly, fascinatingly queer the whole film is. The uneasy dynamic between Benedict Cumberbatch’s sad, closeted rancher Phil, whose quick temper and filthy cowboy get-up help to mask his sexuality, and Kodi Smit-McPhee’s delicate, almost otherworldly med student Peter, whose exterior softness hides something far steelier is endlessly intriguing for everything it does and doesn’t say. The moment that burrowed its way under my skin the deepest was the film’s big turning point as Phil watches Peter confidently strut over to examine a bird’s nest despite being ridiculed and called a faggot by the men nearby. It’s when the elder gay decides to suddenly take him under his wing for what purpose we’re not so sure and it seems, in the moment, neither is Phil. Is it some sort of desire? Is it a need to protect? Is it a form of jealousy? Is it perhaps all three? It represents a specific, hard-to-explain confusion that comes with generational queerness and while others might interpret it as a moment of darkness (was it really just a new way to torture Kirsten Dunst’s beleagured mother?), I saw it as something tender. And undeniably queer. Benjamin Lee This was the year an American titan left us: Stephen Sondheim, whose great early hit West Side Story (for which he wrote the lyrics at 27) has now been revived in a new screen version by Steven Spielberg. So it is fitting that Sondheim appeared for a poignant moment, sympathetically played in cameo by Bradley Whitford, in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s tick, tick ... BOOM!: the autobiographical musical by the late Jonathan Larsen, who wrote Rent, detailing his heartbreaking attempts to get an early work produced – a complicated, ambitious, futurist extravaganza called Superbia.Larsen, played by Andrew Garfield, is seen presenting a workshop performance with some musicians and singers and himself narrating and singing at the piano keyboard. Afterwards, two established figures of the musical theatre world take to the stage and offer their advice and criticism. Richard Kind plays a fictional person called Walter Bloom (based, it is suggested, on the composer and lyricist Charles Strouse). The other is Sondheim himself – whose simple presence in the room stuns and awes all the young hopefuls – a rumpled, donnish, bearded figure, modestly retreating behind his shy mannerisms.Bloom is a supercilious, condescending fellow who dismisses the oddities and complexities of Larsen’s work and says that it’ll never work commercially. But then Sondheim speaks and says that these are the things which make him like Larsen’s work – and of course the submissive creep Bloom instantly tries turning around 180 degrees and claiming that he agrees. And what made me love this scene the most is that Sondheim says that the “tunes” are “swell”. This is the way a New Yorker of the old school speaks – there’s casual heft and authenticity in his words. And the simple spectacle of this great figure, taking time out of his day to help people coming up, is very moving. Peter Bradshaw Of all the movies released this year – or in fact this century – this is the one that looked most disastrous on paper. I remember sweating over Sir Gawain and the Green Knight at university: that plus Dev Patel plus the guy who directed Pete’s Dragon and A Ghost Story? You’re having a laugh. But the laugh was on us, and to be honest, pretty much every frame of The Green Knight is a movie moment in itself. If I had to pick one, it’s probably the pivotal moment when the tree-faced warrior gets his head separated from his shoulders, and then creepily, comes back to life, picks his head up and gallops his horse out of the door. Despite the batsqueak of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (“Tis but a scratch!”) this is as stunning as anything else in the film. Andrew Pulver Pablo Larrain’s remarkable, almost fully fictional biopic flirts extensively with camp, as befits a study of an celebrity already exaggeratedly set in the public’s imagination via tabloid culture and kitsch iconography. But that tendency reaches its apotheosis in an exquisitely nightmarish banquet scene, where the combination of still royal decorum and fevered mental illness prove entirely too much for Kristen Stewart’s frail, exhausted Princess Diana to bear. Frantically, the tugs at the chunky string of pearls around her neck – lovelessly gifted by her husband – that may as well a noose. Finally, it comes apart, shallot-sized pearls scattering and bouncing across the dinner table – and bobbing into her pale green soup. Naturally, she scoops them up with a spoon and gets chewing. It’s a dream sequence of nakedly absurd horror, risking immense bad taste in its allusion to Diana’s eating disorder. Yet there’s something strangely powerful, too, about its spectacle of a woman attempting to destroy (to eat, even) her own stifling privilege. Guy Lodge",Arts/Film,Aqua aerobics! Awkward sex!

12/24/2021,"Not so fast. The stuttering form of leaders Fulham and second-placed Bournemouth – neither have won any of their past five matches – has knitted things together towards the summit to tee up an intriguing second half of the season. A four-point blanket covers the top four, with Blackburn nestled in third above West Brom after bouncing back from a freak 7-0 trouncing by Fulham last month (it was only the second time they had lost a league game by more than a single goal since October 2020) by recording six wins in seven games, conceding twice. Among those on the Fulham scoresheet was Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has 25 goals in 27 games for club and country this season and whose league tally of 22 means he has outscored four strugglers in the division: Hull, Peterborough, Barnsley and Derby.  Blackburn, who finished 15th last season, are the surprise package. In the summer they reinvested £400,000 of the £15m they received for talisman Adam Armstrong on a left-back from League One (Tayo Edun), Harvey Elliott and Taylor Harwood-Bellis exited after productive loan spells, a dozen senior players departed and yet they are mounting an unlikely promotion charge. Ben Brereton Díaz, the Stoke-born former England Under-19s striker turned Chile sensation, has provided a stream of goals, and the home-grown midfielders Lewis Travis and John Buckley have also impressed. Brereton Díaz has scored 19 in 23 games since adding his mother’s maiden name to his shirt in August, compared with nine in his previous 80 matches. West Brom are strong defensively but urgently require a bona fide No 9 to kill teams off, with Valérien Ismaël keen on reuniting with Daryl Dike. Bournemouth seemed untouchable for so long, Lloyd Kelly and Gary Cahill forming a peerless partnership, but defensive sloppiness has crept in. Fulham’s lead may have been shredded but budging them off pole position is another thing. They are blessed with midfield options, including the rejuvenated Jean Michaël Seri, the often-overlooked Neeskens Kebano, and Harry Wilson, who tends to enjoy himself at this level. Then there is Mitrovic. Five points separate fifth-placed Queens Park Rangers and Blackpool, who continue to make impressive strides under Neil Critchley, in 13th but the former can point to two games in hand on most rivals as an opportunity to move level with West Brom. Nottingham Forest were bottom with a solitary point when Chris Hughton was sacked in mid-September but a few months on the outlook is distinctly different. Steve Cooper’s side are motoring in the rear-view mirror of sixth-placed Stoke City, who seem to have struck a healthy balance between experience and youthful exuberance – they have not paid a fee for any player over the age of 23 since Michael O’Neill took charge two years ago – with Mario Vrancic and Josh Tymon impressing at either end of the scale. Sheffield United are brimming with confidence after replacing Slavisa Jokanovic with Paul Heckingbottom and look well stocked to push on from mid-table. The majority of the squad that won promotion to the Premier League under Chris Wilder remain – Billy Sharp, Ollie Norwood and John Egan continue to be key pillars – but in Iliman Ndiaye who, like Sorba Thomas at Huddersfield, made big strides at non-league Boreham Wood, they possess a welcome unpredictability. The 21-year-old forward ran from inside his own half on Monday to beat Fulham and earn a fourth straight win. “You’ve not seen the best of him yet,” was Heckingbottom’s verdict. Wilder is now at Middlesbrough and has overseen an impressive upturn, which has restored optimism, though they may need to bolster their forward line to sustain their push. Coventry City have lost momentum in recent weeks but Mark Robins’ side, for whom Callum O’Hare has been particularly instrumental, remain very much in the conversation. Their unlikely ascent towards the top is one of the stories of the season. Millwall and Huddersfield appear too inconsistent to trouble the top six. Weighed down by a 21-point penalty, Derby County’s primary focus is on surviving as a club, never mind in the division. Any hopes of staying up vanished a long time ago but Wayne Rooney continues to pull results out of the bag with a mishmash of a squad. The administrators, Quantuma, remain confident of selling the club in January. Last month supporters clubbed together to pay off the club’s £8,304 debt to St John Ambulance, one of dozens of creditors. Reading are another side nursing a points deduction for breaching financial rules. They have no shortage of pedigree – Andy Carroll, Junior Hoilett, Danny Drinkwater, Scott Dann, Alen Halilovic, Baba Rahman, George Puscas, the list goes on – but a team that began last season so promisingly have shown few signs of taking flight, even if John Swift has been one of the division’s standout performers for a team one place above the drop. Peterborough are leaking goals but are in no way adrift and will hope to drag Cardiff, Hull, who have lost only one of their past seven games, Bristol City and Birmingham into trouble. Second-bottom Barnsley have got nowhere near replicating a memorable last campaign – they have won one of their past 21 matches and are the division’s lowest scorers – but the head coach, Poya Asbaghi, can see green shoots. “I’m sure when we start winning that we can create a machine that goes on and on,” he says.",Sport/Football,Championship at halfway: Blackburn surge and remarkable Forest revival,https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2021/dec/24/championship-at-halfway-blackburn-nottingham-forest-fulham

12/24/2021,"In Lebanon’s year of loss and deprivation, simple pleasures have steadily drained away along with its fortunes. But amid a crisis renowned for breaking new ground, few Lebanese had thought their ability to stay in touch was at risk – until a pre-Christmas warning sent shudders through the country. The telecommunications minister, Johnny Corm, warned this week that a lack of funds and fuel could soon see Lebanon’s already struggling internet grind to a halt, making festive calls and messages even trickier than usual – and a financial and social disintegration like no other even more acute.  As weary Lebanese approached another lacklustre Christmas, the warnings appeared to be bearing out. The internet was barely functioning in Tripoli on Tuesday. By the day after, Beirutis could barely communicate or open websites. Things were forecast to get worse in time for Christmas Day. Miriam Sarhan, 31, who left Lebanon for Canada in July after losing faith in her homeland, says calling her family on messaging apps had helped settle her in and reassure her family back home. “I was speaking to them by video in November,” she says. “Now we can’t even manage a voice call. What else will my country take from me?” The crisis affecting the telecom sector mirrors that faced by all arms of government; bills to overseas providers need to be paid in US dollars and the cost of doing so has increased up to twentyfold since the country’s plunging currency lost parity in late 2020. Since then, the value of the lira has been in freefall, while costs of goods and services have skyrocketed. Through it all, staying in touch had been at least one salvation; as had a hope that somehow, someday, things would get better. But as a cruel winter sets in, after an arduous year, there is little sign of a brighter horizon. Resilience, once a buzzword used to describe the Lebanese, is now parodied by citizens themselves. “How much more can we be humiliated?” asks Mustafa Alloush, an expatriate living in London. “It seems something that outsiders wish upon us to make themselves feel better about our situation.” Downtown Beirut, a crossroads of the city’s myriad manifestations, is unusually bleak and empty this year. As winter rains swept in across the still-ruined port nearby, the space where a Christmas tree normally stands was empty and abandoned. In the predominantly Armenian suburb of Bourj Hammoud in the capital’s east, the festive season barely appears to have been marked this year. Christmas decorations are few and far between. So are shoppers. “It’s a very depressing Christmas,” says Sandy Gumijian, a shop owner. “There’s no lighting, no decoration. And I’m not selling anything except food and bread. It’s much worse than last year. Worse for the kids too.” A coffee shop owner, George Kouyoumijian, 43, says: “Where is Christmas? Look at the store, there’s nothing. Usually there are decorations all over this street. It should be full of lighting and life. We thought last year was the worst and we were praying for the end of 2020, but this year is worse for sure.” Kamilla, a gift shop owner, says she could not afford decorations and lighting this year. “You are the first one to come to my shop with a smile,” she says. How Lebanon sank so low continues to trouble many of its citizens, who left the country in droves this year – determined to start again in the Gulf states, Canada, the UK or Europe. While immigration numbers are hard to discern from a broken bureaucracy, removal companies have a backlog of several months for people leaving the country – and the local carrier, Middle East Airlines has done a brisk business on outbound routes. Inbound flights before Christmas have also been busy – but that is not expected to last. “These are expats coming home for two weeks, their bags full of dollars from new lives abroad,” says an executive with Middle East Airlines, the national airline of Lebanon. “This is the new diaspora, which is added to the old one. We have always been a country of exiles, but never quite like this.” Indeed, what Lebanon now represents has become a riddle for many of its citizens. From postwar uncertainty to fleeting opportunity, short-term boom – and now emphatic bust, the trajectory has been volatile. Returning to the homeland from lives made abroad had remained an ambition for many. “It was for me too,” says Saad Chamoun, who arrived from Dubai to visit his family this month. “But something changed in me. I left in July and have been gone for five months. I’m working in reinsurance and am happy. I don’t want to come home, because the country is no longer for me. All my friends are the same.” With a middle class being fast whittled out, and a diaspora estimated at up to 18 million people having little incentive to return, Lebanon’s brain drain has an etch of permanence to it. “And that’s worrying,” says Khaled Zaidan, a banker. “The educated elite and the young and ambitious were always the country’s strategic depth. How does anyone ever lure them home now?” As the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, left Beirut on Tuesday after a 48-hour visit, he reiterated grave concerns and the need for reforms, which a broken state and deeply factionalised government seem unable to deliver. More than 18 months after the Beirut explosion – as striking a symbol of state dysfunction seen anywhere in modern times – there has been little progress in bringing to account those culpable for the blast that devastated the city. Those responsible for the Ponzi scheme that crippled the banking system and the decades of industrial-scale corruption that preceded it also remain well out of reach of the enfeebled courts. “Christmas is a thing of yesteryear,” says Sarah Yamout, a Beirut resident. “Celebrating a real one has become something of our fantasies too.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Lebanon faces ‘depressing’ Christmas as internet crisis stops festive calls,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/24/lebanon-faces-depressing-christmas-as-internet-crisis-stops-festive-calls
12/24/2021,"This was the year I started listening to non-stop pop music. It could be something to do with everything seeming hard and sharp at the moment, like those morphing spikes on the coronavirus. Those jaggedy little ridges tearing through our day-to-day lives. Growing up, pop was a dirty word and instead indie music was the soundtrack of my youth. I’ll probably never be as happy as I was stumbling around the Pavilion Tavern in Brighton drenched in lager, as the the Futureheads’ Hounds of Love blared from the speakers. Hip-hop figured heavily too. The crunchiness of Wu Tang Clan, like gravel underfoot. The ego of Kanye. The erudition of Kendrick. The melancholy of Frank. The swagger of Jay-Z. And latterly, the sheer hot-diggety of Skepta and the seductive hallucinatory quality of A$AP.  Then I went to university and everyone did too many drugs and listened to dubstep, so I listened to that too. I never rated it, but a friend was a DJ for a pirate radio station in London and it all seemed pretty cool. I’d stagger around clubs to Benga, Skream and Crookers instead, covered in sweat, wondering where I’d left my mind. It was usually in the loos. Along with my phone. Recently, I decided I couldn’t “do” music with a BPM over 120 any more, it conjured too many memories – men I hadn’t slept with; men I shouldn’t have slept with, a few women I’d slept with too, actually; nights I’d missed out on; nights I shouldn’t ever have gone on. So I got pretentious and started listening to modern classical. Philip Glass, Ólafur Arnalds, Max Richter, that sort of thing. I “explored” the intersection of classical and dance: Actress, Nicolas Jaar, Nils Frahm. I spent a lot of time at the Barbican. That was as much about the boys as the music, though. And from Nicolas Jaar, I sidestepped to FKA twigs – with Sampha and Solange providing stepping stones along the way – and I was only one leap away from Lorde really. Then the pandemic hit. Lorde, Lil Nas X, Lana provided a much needed comfort blanket, along with Ariana, Bey and the occasional dose of RiRi. I wouldn’t tell anyone I was listening to pop for many months to come. I learned to dance, instead, by myself, in my bedroom. A perfect remedy for lockdown. In that, I learned humility. I was a body that responded to aural stimuli, I had rhythm, I was a person, not just a mind. A fleshy lump of humanness, gyrating, and it was lovely. Delicious, even. There’s no avoiding it: pop is sexy and sex is joy. For three and a half minutes we can forget the impending doom and just shimmy. There’s the queer thing too. Pop is subversive, we all know that. Lil Nas X has done more for gay rights than anyone since whoever threw that first brick at Stonewall. Pop is a nightclub, to extend the metaphor, with no door policy. A world unto itself, entry gratis, as long as you have a subscription to a music-sharing service, or can bear the ads on YouTube. You can be yourself, or someone else if you can’t handle that just now. There are no rules, have fun. As Lorde says “I’m kinda like a prettier Jesus”. You are, goddammit, Lorde. And I’m your disciple. But, Lil Nas X, if you’re reading this: my DMs are open.

12/24/2021,"Fresh from his crushing victory over Ian Nepomniachtchi in Dubai, Magnus Carlsen opens his defence of his world rapid and blitz titles in Warsaw starting at 2pm GMT on Boxing Day. The 31-year-old Norwegian faces a serious double threat to his ambition to hold three crowns – classical, rapid and blitz – simultaneously, and will need all his legendary skills. Games and commentaries will be viewable live and free online. The tournament is being staged at the PGE Narodowy Stadium, the home of Poland’s national football team.  In October 2015, the five-times US champion Hikaru Nakamura was briefly ranked No 2 behind Carlsen at classical chess, apparently fulfilling his tweet made two years earlier that: “I am the only person who is going to stop Sauron in the context of chess history.” The juxtaposition of Carlsen and the title character of Lord of the Rings went viral. They had already fought it out in a private all-night, six-hour, 40-game blitz match played in Moscow in 2010, which Carlsen won 24.5-15.5. There is also recent history between the pair in their frosty exchange of tweets after Nakamura won at St Louis in August this year. Nakamura started his Twitch stream in March 2020 with 2,000 followers. Now he has 1.3 million, as his brand of playing all-comers at fast speeds, including bizarre openings like the Bongcloud, and the way he combines instructional nuggets with expressive phraseology, all attract huge audiences. The 34-year-old has not played a rated classical game for two years, but is as deadly as ever at speed play. Apart from the world blitz and rapid, the Blue Riband of fast events is chess.com’s online speed championship, which has just ended its sixth season. Its knockout format is testing: 16 invited grandmasters, 90 minutes of 5/1 blitz, 60 minutes of 3/1 blitz, and 30 minutes of 1/1 bullet. Carlsen won the first two finals in 2016 and 2017, but has not taken part since. Nakamura won the next three, and did it again in Monday’s 2021 final, when he crushed Wesley So 23-8. Earlier he eliminated Peter Svidler, Anish Giri and Ding Liren, the last only after tie-breaks and Armageddon. Victory by such a wide margin over So, who was Carlsen’s main competitor on the online Meltwater Champions Tour, is a clear statement of intent that Nakamura is ready for a serious challenge to the No 1 at Warsaw in the coming days. His performance was highlighted by an 18-move miniature, which is featured in this week’s puzzle, and where So was losing as early as move 10 Ba3? e4! Carlsen faces an equally dangerous challenge in Warsaw from Alireza Firouzja, the player widely viewed as heir apparent to the throne. The 18-year-old former Iranian, who now lives in Chartres and represents France, has long been bracketed with Carlsen and Nakamura as the world’s best in three-minute blitz and one-minute bullet. Firouzja, like Nakamura, has history with Carlsen, notably in the controversial finish to their game in the 2019 world blitz in Moscow. Two years on from Moscow, Firouzja is the world No 2, has triumphed impressively in Riga and in the European teams, and is the only player who Carlsen would be interested in taking on in his next championship defence in 2023. The world No 1 confirmed his stance and explained it further in a new blog this week: “I found that the negative has started to outweigh the positive, even when winning. I have by now played against the previous generation and three leading players of my generation. Being result-oriented has worked out for me in these matches, but it doesn’t feel sustainable long term. Passion must be the main driver. It is unlikely that I will play another match unless maybe if the next challenger represents the next generation.” There are plenty of others in the Warsaw field of over 150, the great majority of them grandmasters, who can upset the big three. David Howell, seeded 46th, is the only English GM entered, while there are no British players in the women’s championship, where the top three seeds are all Russian. Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee, the “chess Wimbledon”, is currently still set to go ahead, despite beginning on 15 January, just one day after the planned lifting of the new Netherlands Covid-19 lockdown. The regulations allow major sporting events, although without spectators, and all Wijk’s amateur sections have been cancelled. Wijk will be the first test of Carlsen’s stated ambition to aim for an all-time record 2900 rating as a target for his future events in place of his probable retirement from future world title matches. Carlsen’s current rating after Dubai is 2865, and Wijk is one of his favourite events, where he has won seven first prizes over the years. Next month he will need to score 9/13 there just to gain a single rating point, while 10/13 will take his rating to 2876. His lifetime official peak is 2882 from 2014 and 2019, and his highest unofficial live rating is 2889. On the plus side for Carlsen, the field for Wijk 2022 is less heavyweight than usual, with only Fabiano Caruana and Giri from the current top 10. Russia’s Andrey Esipenko, 19, who beat Carlsen at Wijk 2021, and India’s Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, 16, are the rising talents. What of Firouzja, the biggest teenage talent of them all, already the hero of many chess fans, and the youngest ever world No 2? There is zero chance of him competing at Wijk next month. The reason is Firouzja’s continuing spat with the Wijk organisers, dating back to the final round of Wijk 2021, when he was disturbed by the moving of tables to prepare for the Giri v Jorden van Foreest first prize speed tie-break. Firouzja was invited to Wijk 2022 several months ago, but negotiations via his father stalled on a demand for financial compensation for the 2021 disturbance, plus a much larger start fee for 2022 than the organisers offered. This is a scenario with echoes of Bobby Fischer in the 70s and Gata Kamsky in the 90s, so chess fans will watch future developments with interest and concern. 3795: 1...Nxf2! and White resigned.

12/24/2021,"Russia is threatening war on Ukraine, but in Kyiv the city council is putting up Christmas trees rather than bomb shelter notices, and organising concerts rather than army recruitment drives. Amid a Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s eastern border and in annexed Crimea, hostile rhetoric between Russia and the US and its allies is edging towards a cold war high, with Ukraine the battlefield for any actual fighting. Ukrainians, however, just emerging from Covid quarantine, are enjoying ice rinks and markets put up for the holiday season and would rather think about how to celebrate the coming new year.  “I’m going to spend New Year with family and friends at home, although I’m sure there will be lots of parties in Kyiv,” said Olya Simbirova, 25, who works in a hairdressing salon in the centre of the capital. “In my circle of friends, no one is talking about a war.” Kyiv is over 700km from the frontline, although some reports suggest Russia, after moving troops into Belarus, may encircle the capital along with other large cities to the east of the city, or use targeted airstrikes. But it is thought to be more likely that eastern and southern areas nearer the frontline will be a target, with Kyiv having to deal with interrupted supplies and communications, as well as Russian sabotage and increased cyber and information warfare. Although a nationwide poll published on 17 December by Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that half of Ukrainians would resist a Russian invasion by taking up arms or through civil resistance, not many believe they will be called on to do so, or are rushing to prepare. After losing swaths of territory to Russia and Russian-backed forces in 2014, and enduring a simmering armed conflict in east Ukraine ever since, not to mention economic hardship and the impact of Covid, many Ukrainians are so inured to threatened disaster they no longer believe politicians and media who, they say, have cried wolf too often. “We’ve heard it all too many times over the last few years,” said Simbirova. “And usually it’s just hype.” Earlier this year the Russian troop buildup on the border began to invoke the spectre of impending invasion, inspiring Simbirova’s mother to announce she was moving to Spain to be safe. The invasion came to nothing at that point, and her mother stayed in Ukraine. More recently, at a November press conference, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, devoted as much time to talking about an alleged 1 December coup plot as he did to Russian invasion. The coup never happened, and many hope the invasion will be similarly chimeric. An international development project in Kyiv recently circulated recommendations among staff for what to do in case of invasion, such as to have a suitcase packed and to check the location of the nearest bomb shelter. But Yevheniya Burdiyan, who works as an accountant, has not heeded the advice. “I haven’t packed a suitcase,” Burdiyan said. “Because I didn’t pack one back then either.” Burdiyan, 49, is from Donetsk in east Ukraine, now under de facto Russian control after fierce fighting in 2014-15. Seven years ago, unable to believe in a war that was already raging, she was the last in her street to tape over her windows against shelling. She left the city in July 2014 on the last train out before the railway line was destroyed. Now she lives in a small settlement just outside Kyiv, built by families similarly displaced from east Ukraine. She says she is too busy to think about another possible war, and her neighbours never discuss it either. “After Donetsk and all the pain we went through, now we live in a little world of family, home, repairs. I’m just happy if I can buy some shelves, because when we moved in we just had bare walls,” she said. “Life goes on and we have to live it, with these little pleasures, and war is somewhere there, in the subconscious.” In Mariupol, 20km from the frontline of the east Ukraine conflict and a likely target of any possible invasion, many residents are also largely ignoring the threat and the council has gone all out on seasonal decorations and events. “They’re planning lots of concerts. City hall is trying to make Mariupol an example of security and cultural development of Ukrainian towns, in contrast to towns on the other side of the frontline,” said Galyna Balabanova, an activist and project manager in Mariupol. Alongside developing military capacity, one of Ukraine’s strategies to counter the Russian threat is to develop cities such as Mariupol so as to win the “hearts and minds” of Ukrainians sympathetic to – or still living in territory de facto controlled by – Russia. Balabanova and her friends are following the news and trying to analyse where Russia might attack, but they are not worried. “We trust in our army and our volunteers,” she said. As Ukrainians continue to focus on the near and dear, Burdiyan knows she cannot influence events anyway. “What we want and what happens are two different things; it doesn’t depend on us,” she said. Meanwhile, she does have something immediate to plan for. Her daughter, who lives in Estonia, is coming home for the holidays. “I have to plan what to cook,” she said, “and make up the bed for her.”",News/World news,‘We’ve heard it all before’: Ukrainians brush aside talk of Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/ukrainians-brush-aside-talk-russian-invasion-ukraine-christmas
12/24/2021,"Rose Matafeo is arguably the breakout star of 2021. Her BBC Three sitcom Starstruck became the channel’s best-performing comedy within weeks of launch, racking up 3m views and earning a second series before it even premiered. The impact was so huge and immediate that you could be forgiven for thinking she had dropped from the sky fully formed.This couldn’t be further from the truth. After winning a New Zealand international comedy festival award for standup in 2007, at the age of 15, Matafeo has conquered just about everything she has ever attempted. She has written for Daily Show-esque satirical news programmes. She has presented entertainment shows. She co-created and starred in a sketch series, and has directed sitcoms. In 2018, her show Horndog – detailing, in part, how she was kicked off a Franz Ferdinand messageboard for being “too racy” – won an Edinburgh comedy award. And last year she was the lead in the film Baby Done, executive produced by Taika Waititi. And yet, even for those of us who knew her work, Starstruck was the perfect showcase for all of Matafeo’s talents. Despite a premise that wasn’t entirely novel – like Notting Hill before it, it told the story of a civilian who accidentally fell in love with a movie star – Matafeo’s presence helped to reset and update a number of hoary old romcom tropes. Equal parts confident and anxious, for a few weeks in April, she was more or less all anyone could talk about. She’s a big deal now. She is also exhausted.  “I’m having a lie-down,” says the 29-year-old New Zealander over the phone from London. Series two of Starstruck is almost complete, marking the end of a two-year treadmill for her, and she is deliberately choosing to pause. “I’ve got no work plans for next year and it’s great,” she says. “I really want to watch about a hundred movies and possibly, I don’t know, just chill out.” It’s a nice idea, but Matafeo isn’t convinced it’ll stick. “I will hate it,” she sighs. “I’ll hate it because I have nothing to do and it will kill me.” Part of the issue seems to be that, as wildly as Starstruck was received, she didn’t have any time to enjoy its success. “I had one day,” she says. “Not even one day. The first series came out on iPlayer at 6am the day before we started shooting the second series.” To compound things, the entire series showed up at once and people quickly discovered that the best way to consume it was in one sitting, like a movie. “Straight away the audience was like, ‘Great! When’s the next one coming out?’,” recalls Matafeo. “I thought, this is like a gut punch! It’s really flattering, like, that’s great! But oh my God! It freaks me out, you know?” Ultimately, though, the lack of a break can only be good for Starstruck. With no downtime between series, Matafeo and her writing partner Alice Snedden didn’t have time to bow to the pressures of fan service, so they didn’t have to second-guess themselves. “It’s scary because you go, ‘Maybe we didn’t write what the audience wanted’,” she says. “You know, people really love the show and you see a lot of series step it up extensively for series two. But it’s actually nice not having that, because it means that we’ve made a second series that we like. It was consistent and in keeping with the spirit of the first one. I’m a terrible people-pleaser so I think it was good not to have that little voice in my head.” Since we’re here to talk about Matafeo’s 2021, it made sense to ask her about the things she enjoyed watching. The short answer is “nothing current” – she caught up with 2019’s Watchmen in February, and adored it – but for the most part she fell back on old favourites. “I became kind of emotionally reliant on Dawson’s Creek,” she says. “I think I still am. Honestly, I got in deep with that and it saved me. It pulled me out of some dark places.” Fittingly, for a woman whose character worked in one, Matafeo has also been taking advantage of the cinemas reopening. “I’ve been going back to the BFI, back to the Prince Charles [cinema in Leicester Square], where I’ve been doing some screenings of Beverly Hills Cop one and two, my favourite films. And been really diving into my interest in more obscure 60s movies that you have to find on some bootleg weird zone on DVD. “But, yeah,” she continues, “it’s been a year of doing hobbies and stuff. When you’re making TV in particular, you look at a screen all day and then when you come home, you’re like ‘I don’t want to look at a screen’. So it’s been a year of getting into model making. I bought a bass guitar. I’m trying to shred on bass guitar. I just got into 16mm film cameras and learned all about that, so it’s been a year of nerd-dom, and I love it.” That’s real self-improvement territory, I say. “It’s borderline,” she says, laughing. “Self-improvement slash self-sabotage in terms of now I spend my money on cameras and I’m not seeing anyone.” Our time is coming to a close, and I’m concerned that Matafeo doesn’t realise how much people enjoyed Starstruck. So I reassert the notion, going on at some length about all the ways I loved it. And I really did. In another year that has been marked by a general sense of gloom, the unapologetic loveliness of Starstruck felt like the shot in the arm we all needed. “Aw, that’s really kind! I’m so glad so many people have liked it, and I hope when the second series comes out, they’ll still like it,” Matafeo replies. She pauses, and checks herself. “But also I don’t care because, you know, whatever.”",Arts/Television & radio,Starstruck star Rose Matafeo: ‘Success freaks me out!

12/24/2021,"When Apollo 11 launched in July 1969, Bill Nelson was an army lieutenant on leave behind the iron curtain, listening with colleagues to the BBC on shortwave radio. “There were three young Americans standing on the hills overlooking Budapest, screaming at the top of our lungs, cheering as that rocket lifted off,” Nasa’s new administrator recalled in a video interview.  By the time Neil Armstrong stepped on to the lunar surface, Nelson was at a London hotel, watching on a grainy black and white TV at three in the morning. “This was all extremely fascinating to me and never in a million years did I think that I was going to end up being able to fly in space. Much more so, never in a million years would I have thought that I would try to offer some leadership to Nasa.” Nelson, who at 79 is two months older than Joe Biden, was the first member of the House of Representatives to go into space. He went on to serve as a Democratic senator for Florida for 18 years. In May he was appointed by Biden to lead Nasa and earlier this month he was in the spotlight when Vice-President Kamala Harris chaired her first meeting of the National Space Council. Nelson’s priorities include the $10bn James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble telescope aiming to launch on Saturday after years of costly delays. Astronomers are on edge because a lot could go wrong. “There are some 300 things that have to work perfectly on this telescope,” Nelson says. “And that’s after a successful launch.” Then there is Nasa’s high stakes effort to return to the moon after half a century. The Artemis programme, a sequel to Apollo, aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface in 2025 or soon after, establishing the first “long-term human-robotic presence” on and around the moon and laying the groundwork for the first crewed mission to Mars in the late 2030s. “Why the moon?” Nelson says. “Because the goal is Mars. What we can do on the moon is learn how to exist and survive in that hostile environment and only be three or four days away from Earth before we venture out and are months and months from Earth. That’s the whole purpose: we go back to the moon, we learn how to live there, we create habitats.” In 2023 a probe will dig down at the south pole of the moon to learn how much water there is beneath the surface. “Because if there’s water, then we’ve got rocket fuel, we’ve got hydrogen and oxygen.” Last time around the US was spurred to the moon by the Soviet Union, which had beaten it to putting the first satellite (Sputnik) and first person (Yuri Gagarin) in space. Today the principal rival is China, which Biden has made an organising principle of his presidency, and space is no exception. China established its own space station with alacrity and is only the second country to have landed a rover on Mars. Is a new space race under way and, on the basis that competition breeds success, might that be a good thing? “Yes to the space race,” Nelson replies. “I think their intention is to bring back a sample from Mars earlier than ours. I think their intention is to try to land on the moon before we land. The facts are the facts and America better pay attention. “But is that a good thing? Not really. What would be a better thing is if they were a partner like Russia has been since 1975.” Leaders of the American and Russian space agencies had a constructive relationship during the later part of the cold war; can Nelson establish a similar channel to his Chinese counterpart? “If I had my druthers I would, but you can’t have a relationship if the other party doesn’t want to have a relationship. It takes two to tango. They have indicated no interest in the two of us doing the tango.” He adds: “They’re good but they’re secretive. They’re not collaborative. They’re not transparent.” All 12 people who walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972 were white American men. In his public remarks, Nelson typically makes a point of saying that Artemis will put the first woman and first person of colour on the moon. Nasa has also produced a graphic novel, First Woman, about a fictional character called Callie Rodriguez who achieves both distinctions. What impact does he think that moment would have on girls and children of colour around the world? “Well, look what female and minority astronauts have already done. It’s caused little girls to dream dreams that they didn’t ever think possible before. Same thing with minorities.” But for now many of the headlines are stolen by billionaire white men such as Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson and Elon Musk. Nelson does not seem perturbed about Nasa’s thunder being stolen, however. “I think it’s great they are spending their money advancing technology. They are opening up press attention and excitement by American people and then, when you add that to the Nasa programme, of which SpaceX is a big part now, it’s all the more exciting.” Musk’s SpaceX is developing a “Starship” lunar lander that can carry a gamechanging 100 tons of cargo. Enough to start building a moon base? “I hope so, but it hasn’t flown.” An unsuccessful legal challenge by Bezos’s rocket company, Blue Origin, caused a delay but Nasa is still targeting February for the first test flight of its moon rocket, the Space Launch System. Raised in Melbourne, Florida, Nelson studied at the University of Florida, Yale and University of Virginia Law School and served on active duty in the army. He began practising law then went into politics, first in the Florida state legislature, then in the US Congress. In 1986 he went from the Washington swamp to the stars on the space shuttle Columbia, orbiting the Earth 98 times over six days and conducting 12 medical experiments, including the first American stress test in space. (Just 10 days after he landed, another shuttle, Challenger, launched and almost immediately exploded, killing all seven crew members.) Michael Collins, the Apollo 11 command module pilot, once described Earth as “blue, white, very shiny … such a beautiful tiny thing, nestled in this black velvet of the rest of the universe”. William Shatner, 90, famed for playing Captain Kirk in Star Trek, rode aboard a Blue Origin rocket in October to become the oldest person in space and was struck by “the covering of blue, this sheet, this blanket, this comforter of blue that we have around us”. Nelson, too, has vivid memories of seeing Earth from afar. “It is so beautiful. It is so colourful. It is suspended in nothing. There’s home and yet it looks so fragile. That experience informed a lot of my public life because I wanted to be, when I returned, a better steward of our planet. “So I think you can just basically boldly say I became more of an environmentalist when I went into space, and that has informed my environmental record now going on 44 years of public service. “It also struck me as a politician that when I looked, as we orbited the Earth every 90 minutes, I didn’t see racial divisions and I didn’t see religious divisions and I didn’t see political divisions – the things that bedevil us here on the face of the Earth. What I saw, we were all citizens of planet Earth, and that’s informed my public service as well.” By way of example he describes Nasa as “the point of the spear” on the climate crisis, designing, building and launching instruments that measure the delicate balance of the environment. Nelson reveals that the agency is planning to set up a “mission control” for climate change at a still-to-be-determined location. “We’re going to allow the public to access it virtually. We’re going to encourage state and local governments as well as our fellow agencies and the federal government to access the data and make it easy for everybody so they can have informed decisions.” Whatever the shortcomings of Cop26, Nelson believes there has been a perceptible shift in public and political opinion on the issue. He notes that Republican senator Ted Cruz – who was the first to call him when news of his nomination for Nasa was leaked by the White House – “was an absolute out and out climate denier and you don’t hear him saying that that much now”. Another subject that has gone increasingly mainstream in Washington is unidentified flying objects. In June a report found that although intelligence officials do not believe aliens are responsible for dozens of accounts of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), they cannot fully explain what is. Nelson comments: “You’ve seen those films now made public. They [navy pilots] know they saw something. What is it? I don’t know. Is it an adversary on Earth that has that kind of technology? I hope not. “Do I think that there is life in the universe? The answer to that is clearly I do and we are searching for it. How can I limit a universe that is so big that I cannot see how big it is, where we are in a galaxy with billions if not trillions of stars and there are additional billions if not trillions of galaxies, and the universe is expanding?” He adds with a chuckle: “Like people that tried to limit Copernicus and Galileo that the Earth didn’t revolve about the sun, that everything revolved around the Earth. So, you get the drift.” What first contact with an alien civilisation would mean for humanity has long been the stuff of science fiction. But politicians take it seriously. After a conversation with his American counterpart in 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev recalled: “President Reagan suddenly said to me, ‘What would you do if the United States were suddenly attacked by someone from outer space? Would you help us?’ I said, ‘No doubt about it.’ He said, ‘We too.’ So that’s interesting.” Nelson, astronaut turned senator turned secretary of space, must be hoping that China’s Xi Jinping feels the same way about saving the planet from greenhouse gases.",News/Science,‘We’re all citizens of planet Earth’: former astronaut Bill Nelson on his mission at Nasa,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/24/bill-nelson-nasa-administrator-interview
12/24/2021,"Wine industry suppliers have been warned to plan ahead amid rising costs and international shortages of a key ingredient in the winemaking process. The sector has been affected by reduced supplies of diammonium phosphate (DAP), a nitrogen fertiliser commonly used during grape fermentation.  Jason Amos, the chair of Wine Industry Suppliers Australia (Wisa), told Guardian Australia that shipping delays and a reduction in supply of DAP from China had combined to increase costs. “I’ve seen prices up to five times more expensive for us in the wine sector,” he said. Amos estimates that previously, between 65 and 80% of the DAP used by the Australian wine industry was imported from China. “The quantities that are required in the wine sector are nowhere near as great as … [for] broadacre agriculture,” he said. While there are European and local suppliers of DAP, Amos said it was more expensive to source the product from these markets. Wisa is most concerned that small-to-medium wine producers such as family businesses may not be able to secure supplies of DAP ahead of the harvest for the 2022 vintage. “What we’re also seeing is that the big corporate companies … they’ve got big tenders and they’ve been able to secure continuity of supply,” Amos said. Grape picking will begin in warmer regions at the end of January and last until April in cooler areas. Grapes are high in sugar when harvested. Strains of yeast are used to ferment that sugar into ethanol – drinking alcohol – and carbon dioxide. Yeast are living organisms that use nitrogen as a food source. “If they don’t have enough nitrogen … the ferment won’t go to completion,” Amos said. “Also, the nitrogen has a big impact on flavour and aroma.” The nitrogen the yeast consume can either come from inorganic sources – those that do not contain carbon, such as DAP – or chemically organic (carbon-containing) sources. Supplies of organic nitrogen, such as those produced by other yeasts – are available and could be used as alternatives to DAP, but winemakers will not be able to rely on them wholly. “If the conditions are poor – and we don’t know that until harvest time – winemakers need a mix of both inorganic and organic nitrogen to optimise the winemaking process,” Amos said. “It’s not one or the other.” He said it was too early to say what impact the DAP shortage would have on consumers. “In terms of quality of wine produced, I don’t have any concerns,” he said. “Technically the winemakers will have to work really hard.”",News/Australia news,Shortage of key ingredient puts Australia’s 2022 wine vintage at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/shortage-of-key-ingredient-puts-australias-2022-wine-vintage-at-risk
