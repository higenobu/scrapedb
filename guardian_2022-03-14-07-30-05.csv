3/14/2022,"Jeremy Kyle Show: Death On Daytime (Channel 4) is a crass title for a rigorous documentary. There is a sense that an investigation like this has been a long time coming. The Jeremy Kyle Show ran for 3,320 episodes over 14 years on ITV, and was at times the channel’s most popular daytime show. More than 1 million viewers regularly watched as its guests argued over paternity, addiction, deceit and betrayal, while Kyle bayed and roared in their faces. ITV claimed, and continues to claim via a lengthy statement at the end of this film, that the aim of the show was to provide “conflict resolution” for its guests. The documentary’s director Kira Phillips pieces together a different picture, and she does so with quiet fury. Steve Dymond was a guest on the show in May 2019, taking a lie detector test to prove to his partner, Jane, that he had not been unfaithful. The test said he was lying. The episode was never broadcast, because Dymond killed himself a few days after filming. Shortly afterwards, ITV cancelled the series with immediate effect. The opening episode of this two-part documentary takes Dymond’s story as its tragic centrepiece. We hear from Dymond’s friends and from his ex-partner, Jane, who speaks with moving honesty about his life and state of mind. It sounds as if he had a problem with lying, and he knew it. One of his hopes was that by appearing on the show, he might receive some help for that. The other was simply that he wanted to prove that he had not cheated on Jane, and the show offered him a lie detector test that he would not have been able to pay for privately. He saw The Jeremy Kyle Show as a potential saviour. “You go on the show because you’re desperate,” says a former member of the production team. Four ex-employees have spoken to the film-makers about their time on the show, on the condition that they would not be identified; instead, actors speak their words, which seems a reasonable compromise. They talk about manipulating the mental health questionnaire that they were supposed to go through with guests. They talk about a culture that not only expected conflict but actively encouraged it; one camera operator who worked backstage describes it as “back-to-back psychological carnage”. They say they would lie to the families of addicts by telling them that they were in competition for a place at rehab, when they were going to be given a place anyway. The idea, it seems, was to push them for a better performance, although we’re told that ITV denies this and are shown a statement that says: “ITV would never condone any of its production staff misleading or lying to guests.” It is a difficult watch, for a great many reasons. Class is an ugly spectre, and looms large. One of the production team accuses Kyle of looking down on his guests, and in unbroadcast footage, we see him call his guests that day “thick as shit”. The judge who famously described the show as “a human form of bear-baiting under the guise of entertainment” when sentencing one guest convicted of ABH when he head-butted another guest (the show was not broadcast) is scathing about its claims of “conflict resolution”. That guest appears here to talk about the effect the conviction had on his life. He lost his job, his home was repossessed and his mental health suffered. All of the interviewees here are dealing with pain, and there is a real rawness on display. The mother of a young woman who was addicted to heroin has complicated feelings about the show now. Her daughter was put into rehab as a result of appearing, yet watching Kyle berate her daughter on the show, where he speaks to her with such appalling venom and disdain – “What are you?”, “You’re disgusting” – is abhorrent. It is an awful indictment of social care funding in the UK that for many of these guests, a TV show that turned their trauma into entertainment appeared to be the only way that they could get the help they needed. There are attempts to explain the popularity of the show by linking it to British comedies that parodied people on benefits, for example, though I think that is an easy target, and there is no mention of the US culture of confrontational chatshows that the The Jeremy Kyle Show clearly adopted. Considering that this is a story about exploitation, great care has been taken to avoid that here, but there are moments that made me feel uneasy; I am not sure what there was to be gained by allowing viewers to hear the distressed, sobbing final voicenotes that Dymond left for his ex-partner. But overall, this is a withering account of how The Jeremy Kyle Show functioned. Hearing insiders talk about how it was made, and what they did, is incredibly powerful. If some of the details are shocking, they are not surprising; it was all there for 14 years, on screen.",Arts/Television & radio,Jeremy Kyle Show: Death On Daytime review – a shocking exposé of the ITV series,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/13/jeremy-kyle-show-death-on-daytime-review-a-shocking-expose-of-the-itv-series
3/14/2022,"My NHS colleague and friend, Caroline Evans, who has died aged 56, was an occupational therapist who became a senior manager in community services. Born and brought up in Penrith, Cumbria, Caroline was the daughter of Lorna (nee Mills), a care home matron, and John Sharpe, a policeman. From Queen Elizabeth grammar school she went on to study for an occupational therapy diploma at Liverpool Institute of Higher Education. Caroline started her career as an occupational therapist at St James’ hospital in Leeds in 1988, before moving to Liverpool, where, in 1995, she became clinical manager at the new Woodlands hospice. She often talked of her pride in setting up a new day hospice with a therapeutic focus for local people. Following a move to Cumbria, Caroline continued in clinical roles until going into NHS management in 2010. After setting up a new community neuroscience service in 2012, she was promoted rapidly, rising to the position of associate director of operations in community services in North Cumbria. Caroline brought something very different to senior NHS leadership. While doctors and nurses focus on doing things to and caring for patients, Caroline’s focus, as an occupational therapist, was always on enabling people (she did not use the word patient) to recover. This emphasis on therapy informed her leadership style. She managed more than 1,000 staff, and they all knew they could look to her directly for support. The combination of such an approach with a great sense of humour won her many friends, and her staff rewarded her with their loyalty, hard work and dedication. Her last achievement in the NHS was to implement eight integrated care communities across North Cumbria. From 2017 she patiently navigated the politics and personalities of the NHS, social care, public health and the voluntary sector in order to come up with an agreed model of care. They went live in 2018. Under Caroline’s leadership in the first year of operation, while national hospital admissions went up, in North Cumbria they went down. Somehow, among the daily pressure of leading NHS services, Caroline found the time to sit on the Guardian’s public leadership editorial panel, as well as study on one of the NHS leadership academy’s programmes, which would have helped her progress to the very top of the NHS. Tragically, the cancer she had been first diagnosed with in 2006 returned in 2019, and she retired. Caroline is survived by her husband, Tim, whom she met at a party in Liverpool in 1988 and married in 1990, her daughters, Laura and Louisa, and her parents.",News/Society,Caroline Evans obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/13/caroline-evans-obituary
3/14/2022,"In England’s national sporting psyche there is a special place reserved for the gallant loser. At times it can feel a little schmaltzy, a touch indulgent. To be beaten but unbowed is a romantic notion though one that can also suggest a certain nobility when the cold, hard facts point to a definitive defeat. Leaving a frazzled Twickenham late on Saturday night you could not help but wonder whether the heroic nature of such a defeat was overblown or if the plaudits heading England’s way were justified after resisting Ireland for so long with 14 men, before two late tries broke their spirit. Maybe Ellis Genge summed it up best when writing on social media: “Not a fan of the old brave losers vibe but I think circumstances probably warrant that.” Part of the problem is that this was supposed to be a defining match for Eddie Jones’s New England project. Victory would have kept them in the hunt for the Six Nations title, defeat would put them out of contention and clamours for Jones to go would resurface. It is one of the vagaries of sport that England suffered their heaviest ever Twickenham loss under Jones and their biggest margin of defeat by Ireland at home, yet emerge from it in considerable credit. Much of that credit is warranted, but England did not show us a great deal we did not already know. They displayed character, resilience and heart by the bucketload but should they not be prerequisites at this level? Maro Itoje and Genge stiffened the sinews and summoned up the blood, but the former would walk into any Test side in the world and the latter has slowly but surely been developing into one of England’s most consistent players this season. Clearly there is a togetherness about this side but that has been evident for a while now. It should also be noted that while Charlie Ewels’ red card was unprecedented in how early it arrived – and the premature departures of Tom Curry and Kyle Sinckler through injury compounded matters – matches have been won by teams going down to 14 men before. Only last year Ireland lost Peter O’Mahony to a red card after only14 minutes in Cardiff, claimed a losing bonus point and had Wales clinging on at the death. England, however, never looked like scoring a try. They have managed only seven in four matches and Marcus Smith has ended with all their points in two of them. Jones suggested afterwards that his side’s performance will bode well for next year’s World Cup, but there is a fair chance England will finish the Six Nations in fifth place again. Repeating their showing in Paris would certainly help but reaching emotional intensity like that in consecutive weeks is no easy feat and as Jones acknowledged afterwards: “If we had the secret potion for that, we’d use it all the time,” before adding: “When you’ve got good spirit you can find it. No one knows the limits of human endeavour, so we intend to find it.” Defeat against the grand‑slam chasing French would mean England again finish the tournament with just two victories, one of which was against Italy, and the ledger will not record their character or resilience on Saturday – the history books will record only a 17-point defeat at home. “We’ve taken massive steps forward,” insisted Jones. “I can’t see how we haven’t progressed the way we want to progress. Obviously our aim was to win the championship. “We’re disappointed we haven’t won the championship, but sometimes circumstances mean that maybe the results don’t mimic the performance. But that certainly catches up – the results will catch up.” As much as Jones talks of progression, he billed this as a semi-final and talked of how Ireland would be met with a wave of physicality they had not seen before. Perhaps Ewels was a little too fired up as a result. “In 18 months’ time, if the same circumstances were to happen in the game, would we lose in the last 15 minutes or would we be able to carry it through for the whole 80?” wondered Itoje, but it would be hard to see anything but another England defeat given how deep they dug in vain on Saturday. Ultimately, there remain question marks around this side, a sense that the potential is there but an uncertainty as to whether it will be realised. The scrum dominance is an obvious positive but Jones says he wants to marry an old-fashioned England pack with a new-look attack and, though there were mitigating circumstances, certainly the latter was not on show against Ireland. Maybe, though, this was one of those occasions that needs to be put into context. Twickenham built to a climax last November when South Africa were in town but the roof was raised on Saturday. That Itoje’s kick-chase and subsequent flattening of Johnny Sexton produced the loudest cheer of the night only goes to show that this was no ordinary contest. It seems remarkable to think that, only 12 months ago, these matches were being played out in empty stadiums. The inquest into another trophyless Six Nations for England is on hold for a week but they contributed to sporting theatre in its purest form. For now, that is something to celebrate.",Sport/Sport,England settle for ‘brave losers vibe’ as Ireland defeat raises doubts | Gerard Meagher,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/13/england-ireland-defeat-eddie-jones-six-nations-rugby-union
3/14/2022,"Eddie Jones believes England can exploit the pressure facing grand slam-chasing France next weekend, insisting his side have already found the winning formula against Les Bleus. England are out of contention for the Six Nations title after the spirited defeat by Ireland but Jones believes a final trip to Paris before next year’s World Cup will be a key “dress rehearsal” for his side. England go into the final weekend out of the title race for the second year in a row but need to finish on a high to avoid another fifth-place finish. Victory for France, meanwhile, would seal a first title since 2010, when they also won the grand slam, but Ireland can still end up as champions if Jones’s side do them a favour. The England head coach has selection headaches with Charlie Ewels facing a ban after his second-minute red card, Tom Curry set to miss out with a hamstring injury and Kyle Sinckler having to go through the return to play protocols after a head injury. Jones does not believe Manu Tuilagi will be ready to return and he was unsure if Sam Underhill will be fully fit to replace Curry – though he may be called upon regardless. France cemented their place in the top spot in Wales last Friday and, though the pressure will be on Jones’s side to avoid a third defeat of this year’s competition, he pointed to the two previous encounters between the two teams, both narrowly won by England at Twickenham. “We just want to play well, we want to take it to them,” Jones said. “We beat them in our last two games, so we’ve got a pretty good track record against them. “For them to be playing for the grand slam, I remember going there in 2016 going for the grand slam and because it’s such a huge thing in European rugby, it does become something in their head, and the only way we can make that live in their head a bit more is to play with such an intensity, and such ferociousness that we put them on the back foot. I think we’ve seen it in a few games. “France are a good team, don’t get me wrong, [but] on your day if you can get stuck into them physically, take away their strengths, you can cause them problems.” England trained on Sunday, just a day after their defeat by Ireland, and Jones explained that they would travel to Paris early with his mind already turning to next year’s World Cup. He added: “Well we are going to France on Tuesday. We’ve always looked at this as an opportunity to start dress rehearsing for the World Cup. We will give the players experience of preparing for a week in France which is important for us, going forward.”",Sport/Sport,Jones claims England can exploit pressure on France in ‘dress rehearsal’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/jones-claims-england-can-exploit-pressure-on-france-in-dress-rehearsal
3/14/2022,"The flat-capped epic’s final series reached its midway mark with an arrival, a return and a departure. Here’s your postmortem of episode three, Gold … “My name’s Hayden Stagg. I hear there’s some men from Birmingham looking for me.” We’d been eagerly awaiting the debut of Stephen Graham as a guest star, an actor who always looked as if he belonged in Peakyland. On the 41-minute mark, he finally arrived. What followed was an electrifying scene that defied expectations. No explosive violence or gangster grandstanding, just the nagging voice of Arthur’s inner demons. Stand-in boss Ada (Sophie Rundle) sent ambitious young buck Isiah Jesus (Daryl McCormack) to Liverpool to deal with the union conveyor Stagg, who had been dipping into the Shelbys’ opium stash at Salthouse Dock and selling the stolen skag in local pubs for profit. Tommy had left a black star, or kill order, next to Stagg’s name. Ada downgraded it to a beating, instructing Isiah to take Arthur (Paul Anderson) with him. Only 10 days clean, Arthur was a shaky shambles, but reinforcements came in the shape of Isiah’s cousins Dougie, Gilly and Joe. The new recruits looked dapper in the Peaky uniform but, as Arthur said: “Any fookin’ man can look like this before. A Peaky Blinder still looks like this after.” Stoically accepting he was due a beating, Stagg didn’t just fearlessly stare Arthur down but got inside the troubled Shelby brother’s scrambled head. Stagg knew about his junk habit and had experience himself, having become hooked on morphine during the first world war. Pointedly calling Arthur “comrade”, he quietly gave a powerful speech about addiction which was half-taunt, half-motivational rehab pep talk. The chastened, shaken Arthur stood his men down and left. Will we see Stagg again, or is a six-minute Stephen Graham appearance all we get? Let’s hope not. This particular Stagg party was over far too soon. Perhaps failing to come down hard will come back to bite the Blinders. As the episode began, Tommy (Cillian Murphy) and his wife, Lizzie (Natasha O’Keeffe), were rushing seriously ill daughter Ruby (Orla McDonagh) to hospital. Superstitious Tommy ranted about a Gypsy curses and punishment for his sins. In reality, she had a tubercular lung infection. Covid comparisons were inescapable as hospital staff wore ye olde PPE and Tommy was told to wear a mask. During his chest X-ray, he was bathed in devilish red light for the second week running. Doctors collapsed Ruby’s left lung. When this didn’t work, they treated her with gold salts, but the disease quickly spread to her right lung, too. While Tommy went off on his wild curse chase, Lizzie was left alone at Ruby’s bedside, wishing her husband was “a normal man”. O’Keeffe excelled in this episode, giving a heart-wrenching portrayal of motherly grief and righteous anger. Defying dramatic convention, there was no miraculous recovery or happy ending. Ruby died and Tommy missed his chance to say goodbye. We left him standing in the rain, dumbstruck by disbelief and devastation. How will his torment play out over the next three weeks? A furious rampage or another breakdown? And can his increasingly precarious marriage survive more woe? “I need you to be me in London,” said Tommy to Ada. The most astute Shelby sibling had been kicking her Mary Jane heels on the sidelines. Now she came into her own, acknowledging: “Although I’m reluctant, I’m actually quite good at this.” Damn straight. Even the insufferably snobby Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson) was impressed, as “the sister” arrived at her Eaton Square apartment. “So she dresses well,” muttered Mitford, instructing her butler to note the label of Ada’s coat. Naturally, darling, it was Chanel. Barely masking their mutual antipathy beneath a veneer of politeness, the two women swapped delicious barbs about the causes of poverty, Egyptian antiquities and fascist Mitford’s repulsive plans for “the great cleansing”. She clearly loved to shock, boasting about being a pornography-using, amphetamine-pepped bisexual. Ada was pleasingly unbothered. It was almost disappointing when the men interrupted. Ada introduced the “next prime minister” Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin) to Uncle Jack Nelson (James Frecheville). The Boston mob boss had his niece Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) in tow, all air-kisses and snarky asides. Ada issued an invitation to Tommy’s house, where political business would be conducted and Nelson could meet “like minds from Dublin who’d like to discuss the future of Europe”. This potentially history-altering summit presumably looms next week. Explaining Tommy’s absence, Ada bonded with Nelson over the fact that he’d lost two siblings to TB (Joseph P Kennedy Sr, the character’s inspiration, had two family members die of cholera). Ada had a crackle of flirtatious chemistry with Nelson – as she did earlier with Isiah. Acting leadership of Shelby Co Ltd is clearly a great aphrodisiac. Sophie Rundle worked her chic suits and sharp wit with style. While Lizzie trusted medical science over “horse thieves and sorcerers”, Tommy embarked on a cowboy-style quest to discover who’d put a hex on his family. First stop: the estranged widow of his late brother John, Esme Shelby-Lee (a welcome return for Aimee-Ffion Edwards’ windswept hair and jangling bangles). Tracking her down via “patrin” signs (arrangements of leaves, placed at the roadside to mark the Travellers’ course), Tommy got a distinctly hostile reception. He was called a “dirty didicoi” (not of pure Romani blood) by her male campmate. When Tommy asked if any of the unwelcoming committee were her man, the ever fiery Esme snapped back: “What use is a man? The horse pulls the wagon, the dog keeps me safe, the cat keeps me warm at night.” Consider yourselves redundant, fellas. The bickering duo embarked on a road trip – first via Rolls-Royce, then horseback – to a remote Gypsy graveyard. Which of Tommy’s many enemies was buried here? A surprisingly obscure one. Three series and 10 years ago, he took a sapphire necklace – payment from Arch Duke Leon Petrovich Romanov and worn by Tommy’s wife, Grace, the night she was shot – to wise old woman BethanyBoswell (the estimable Frances Tomelty), convinced it was cursed. Bethany gave it to her sister Evadne, who in turn hung it around the neck of her daughter Connie. She began to cough, and died that night. Evadne duly laid a curse for when Tommy’s own daughter turned seven, so he’d know how it felt. At Connie’s graveside, desperate Tommy vowed to track down Evadne, despite the Boswells being a “wild tribe”, who “roam from the border to the sea”. He’d pay her handsomely to lift the curse and spare his daughter. Tragically, it was too little, too late – although “Sapphire” happens to be the title of next week’s episode. A hint that the Boswells will have a further role to play? For me, this was the standout episode of the series so far. There were several killer scenes – Tommy’s standoff with the Gypsies, Ada’s drawing room jousting, the storming of Liverpool docks – before the emotional sucker punch of Ruby’s death. But, is it just me or is this series yet to fully catch fire? So far, it has felt as if Steven Knight is merely setting the stage. Mosley, Mitford, Michael Gray, Captain Swing and Alfie Solomons all wait in the wings. Ada is creeping on the come-up. Gina and Esme are back. Linda’s on her way. Churchill and even Hitler could yet have a part to play. I have faith that this is the calm before the climactic storm. I enjoyed Tommy’s “horse kicking its crate” analogy but it was pipped by Ada’s sardonic reply when Diana asked why Tommy was so “emotionally mutilated”: “Because he’s a character in a novel, of course. One of those novels that ladies like you read, all about wild men.” Small Heathcliff, anyone? Anna Calvi and Nick Launay’s atmospheric score has rarely sounded so spaghetti western-esque. For sheer punk swagger, though, the standout was Idles’ Kill Them With Kindness as Arthur’s posse strode into Liverpool Docks. This marks the third time that Stephen Graham has appeared in a Steven Knight series, after playing Atticus in Taboo and Marley in A Christmas Carol. It made sense that the racially diverse new recruits hailed from “the streets of Alum Rock”, an area of Birmingham with a rich migrant history.. London’s Eaton Square and hospital exteriors were actually filmed in Le Mans Crescent, Bolton – becoming a familiar location after appearing in It’s a Sin and The Ipcress File. Gold compounds were indeed used in treatment of tuberculosis, popularised during the 1920s, due to the work of the trailblazing bacteriologist Robert Koch. Their toxicity was eventually found to outweigh any therapeutic benefit.
