1/29/2022,"A photo and video of the F-35 that crashed in the South China Sea this week have appeared online. The US Navy said the photo and video were taken by someone on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson. The Navy said that the images were taken ""during the crash."" The US Navy confirmed Friday that a photo and video circulating on social media this week did show an F-35C, one of its most advanced fighter aircraft, crash-landing on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and floating in the South China Sea after falling off the carrier. ""The ship has assessed that the video and photo covered by media today were taken onboard USS Carl Vinson,"" Cmdr. Hayley Sims, a 7th Fleet public affairs officer, said Friday. Sims said the images from the carrier were taken ""during the crash."" CNN first reported the Navy's confirmation of the imagery authenticity. The photo from the incident was first appeared on Thursday on Reddit and shows an F-35 floating on the surface of the water with the cockpit canopy open. The Navy told Insider in an earlier statement that it was unable to confirm the authenticity of this photo, but that has since changed. —Brian Everstine (@beverstine) January 27, 2022 A video surfaced Friday showing an F-35 approaching the carrier, but it cuts off before the jet's crash-landing. —Brian Everstine (@beverstine) January 28, 2022 A Pacific Fleet spokesperson told Insider that although the Navy has determined that the photo was taken from the Carl Vinson, it remains unclear if it has been manipulated in any way. The US Navy revealed Monday afternoon that an F-35C Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, a naval variant designed and built specifically for carrier operations, experienced a ""landing mishap"" during routine flight operations in the South China Sea, forcing the pilot to eject. Seven sailors aboard the carrier were injured in the incident, which saw the jet damage the flight deck, though only superficially, before crashing into the South China Sea, where it now awaits recovery operations. The Navy told Insider this week that it is working on plans to recover the fifth-generation fighter, which experts and analysts have said China might try to get its hands on if the US failed to get it back. Mark Cancian, a senior advisor for the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Navy Times that ""this is our most sophisticated aircraft,"" noting that ""it has all kinds of electronics onboard that our adversaries would love to get a hold of."" ""We need to make sure they don't,"" he added. Responding to those particular concerns, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday that it has ""no interest in their aircraft."" The Navy said in its latest statement that ""there is an ongoing investigation of the incident,"" though it is unclear if that referred to just the accident or the imagery leak as well. This week's incident follows another in November 2021 in which a British pilot flying an F-35B, a short-takeoff/vertical landing variant, had to eject from the aircraft during takeoff while the British Royal Navy's flagship carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth conducted flight operations in the Mediterranean. The mishap aircraft, which slipped off the flight deck into the ocean, was pulled from the sea in December amid reported concerns about the Russians possibly trying to recover the plane.

1/29/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's defence minister said on Friday Berlin's reluctance to supply Kyiv with weapons encourages Russian aggression, and suggested Moscow may hope to revive the German Democratic Republic in eastern Germany. Unlike some of its NATO allies, Germany is not providing Kyiv with arms during its standoff with Russia, which has massed troops near Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal also reported last week that Berlin had refused to issue permits https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-ukraine-arms-idUSL1N2U123W for German-origin weapons to be exported from Estonia to Ukraine. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament that Kyiv appreciated Germany's help in treating wounded soldiers -- Berlin has said it will send Ukraine a field hospital and 5,000 helmets. ""But we do not accept the official position (of Germany) regarding the supply of weapons and other decisions that undermine the security of Europe and de facto encourage the aggressor,"" he said. ""We warned our Western partners that the Kremlin's goal is not so much Ukraine as to undermine NATO and the EU."" Russia has been pressing demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe. Its security demands, presented in December, include anend to further NATO enlargement, barring Ukraine from everjoining and pulling back the alliance's forces and weaponry fromeastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. Reznikov suggested Russia may want to raise the question of restoring the German Democratic Republic, which was founded in the eastern part of Germany in 1949, ruled by communists and dominated by Moscow until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. German reunification followed in 1990. ""The restoration of the GDR is a logical continuation of the Russian demands that have already been made,"" he said. Russia has said it does not plan to attack Ukraine and that it does not want war. It has made no reference to a desire to redraw Germany's borders. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said this month that Germany had ""not supported the export of lethal weapons in recent years"" and his defence minister has said Berlin does not send lethal weapons to crisis areas because it might ""fuel the situation"".
