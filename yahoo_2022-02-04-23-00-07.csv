2/4/2022,"It has been nearly two years since my “mild” coronavirus infection cleared up and I began having symptoms of “long COVID.” In that time, I’ve undergone seven CT scans, five ultrasounds, two spinal taps, two X-rays, two lung function tests, one MRI, one echocardiogram and one sleep study. I’ve made three trips to the emergency room, been hospitalized once and had care provided by 27 doctors, nine nurse practitioners, three physician’s assistants and one therapist. And here’s the brutal reality: I’m still not any closer to finding a clear solution to end this living nightmare. One question continues to haunt me: Will I ever get better? In an effort to answer it, I’ve sought out the advice of other “long-haulers,” dived into scientific research, visited medical clinics around the world and cathartically written about my fears and struggles. Now I’m documenting what it’s really like to battle this mysterious illness while trying to work a full-time job. Long COVID — defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a “wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience four or more weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19” — has affected an estimated 100 million people globally, new studies show. In the United States, 22 million Americans are estimated to suffer from the long-term effects of the virus, according to the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. There are more than 200 symptoms, including fatigue, brain fog, headaches, heart palpitations, shortness of breath and even hair loss. While my lab tests come back mostly normal, my daily reality is far from it — with searing migraine headaches, astonishingly low energy levels, random muscle spasms, electric-like shocks in my joints and tissues, burning lung pain, fluttering heart palpitations, constant ringing in my ears, cognitive decline, sudden loss of strength in my hands, spastic tremors and vibrations, blurry vision, narcoleptic-like sleep impairment and frightening POTS-related fainting spells. Early on, most doctors wrote me off as a “heartsink patient” — in other words, a hopeless case. The tests, I was told, weren’t showing what I was describing. Medical advice ranged from “You’re just anxious, stressed and depressed” to “I understand what you’re going through, but there’s really nothing I can do.” Or, as was more often the case, I was referred to specialists who also didn’t have any answers. It was one big game of pass the buck. At one point during a hospital stay last year, I found myself wishing that I’d be diagnosed with something really major — at least then I’d be taken seriously and have an explanation for when people ask, “You look fine, what’s wrong?” Because when you have an invisible illness, half the battle is convincing people that the occasional smile on your face is not a sign of wellness, but rather a coping mechanism. I’ve come to realize a fundamental truth about health care systems in the U.S. and U.K.: They are ill-prepared to properly handle chronic illness patients. With the current systems’ understaffing and high burnout rates, it’s much easier to tell a patient that their symptoms are psychosomatic or behavioral rather than attempt to work in a true partnership to develop a solution, Dr. David Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation for the Mount Sinai Health System, tells me. “There’s nothing worse, from a clinician-ego point of view, than a patient who doesn’t get better,” says Putrino, who helps treat long COVID patients. “So when a patient shows up day after day and is just not better, the ego battle to say ‘Well you’re not better because you’re doing something wrong’ is really, really strong. A lot of clinicians in the country right now or in the world are losing that battle of ego.” Luckily, things are changing. With billions of dollars being poured into long COVID research in the U.S., new clues are emerging about possible causes and avenues to study. In October 2021 — more than a year since patients first started speaking up about the condition — the World Health Organization finally published an official definition for “post COVID-19 condition.” According to the WHO, approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients experience post COVID-19 condition symptoms for weeks and months. Given the number of confirmed global COVID-19 cases — now over 383 million — the enormity of the situation becomes clear: It’s not just a public health crisis, but a global economic one as well. “Long Covid is increasingly a significant headwind to the labor market, for businesses to get operations up and running, and, ultimately, for the broader economy to kick into high gear,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told CNN. Help can’t come fast enough, especially as an increasing number of COVID-19 patients emerge as the Omicron variant surges. With daily case numbers in January shattering records, there are concerns about a “potential explosion” of long COVID patients in February and March. Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, who studies long COVID at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, estimates that approximately 1.3 million Americans are out of work due to long COVID. The struggle to handle long COVID symptoms is affecting an especially important workforce demographic. “I’m seeing a lot of younger people with end-stage cardiac or neurological disease — people in their 30s and 40s who look like they’re in their 60s and 70s,” Vineet Arora, dean for medical education at University of Chicago Medicine, said in an interview with The Atlantic’s Ed Yong. “I don’t think people understand the disability wave that’s coming.” That disability wave has the potential to cause major disruptions to businesses and health care systems — and ruin careers in progress. Coping with the daily reality of long COVID — or any chronic, mysterious illness — is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded: You have no idea what is coming next, but you can sense when things are changing. Some days the pain is so excruciating that all I can do is curl up in bed and pray. Other days, I have decent energy levels and can function at nearly 60 percent. It’s all so unpredictable and debilitating, which makes holding down a full-time job nearly impossible. I’ve had to pull back from my normal pace and turn down opportunities, and, as a result, I feel that I’ve fallen behind at work. Every day, I meet more people just like me, whether it’s chatting on Twitter or reading posts on Body Politic’s Slack support group: long COVID patients desperately struggling to work and cope with brain fog — a phrase that doesn’t accurately reflect its true nature: I’m 41 years old and often find myself unable to recall basic things such as familiar names, dates and events. I lose my train of thought midsentence and struggle to get back on track. I have trouble processing what a person has just told me. I need to reread entire paragraphs because they don’t compute on first glance. Thoughts race in my head and I find it difficult to organize them. I’ve become a procrastinator for the first time in my life. I’m short-tempered, anxious and extremely moody. Long-haulers struggling with cognitive impairment and worry about going back to the office are often finding requests for remote work and workplace modifications turned down by their employers. Because long COVID affects everyone differently, companies are likely finding it difficult to issue a one-size-fits-all policy. I am fortunate that my company allows for a flexible schedule and remote working. The thought of schlepping to an office every day is hard to fathom, especially as an immunocompromised worker due to the long-term effects of COVID-19. Last July, I admitted to myself, and to my extremely understanding boss, that I couldn’t handle the demands of a full-time job and long COVID. I needed to step back from daily tasks to focus on becoming a functional human again. I could no longer put on a brave face during virtual meetings — the chronic pain had become too great to conceal. Something drastic had to be done. I took advantage of a company-provided COVID-19 leave of absence and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to address the issues. The answer was clear: No more running around to different medical offices and hospitals each week and no more seeing clinicians who didn’t know about long COVID. I needed an actual rehabilitation facility with specialists all talking to each other and formulating an integrative treatment plan. But getting into such a specialized facility is not easy. Many of the facilities in the U.S. require either a positive coronavirus or positive antibody test. However, a large number of long COVID patients have nothing to show since testing was either nonexistent or extremely limited when they contracted the virus — or they weren’t able to get an antibody test until months after the acute infection cleared up. It is possible to have had COVID-19 and test negative for both the virus and antibodies. So why the strict entry requirements? “Federal guidelines require you to follow certain criteria for being a specialty center,” Putrino, of the Mount Sinai Health System, says. “If you’re a private practitioner — if you’re not in some center of excellence or specialty center — then you follow the CDC recommendations and guidelines, which is you don’t need to see a positive PCR test, you don’t need to see antibodies, because we know these are imperfect, inaccurate measures of whether or not someone had COVID.” Available treatments for long COVID, meanwhile, are expensive, unregulated and often not covered by insurance companies. “Part of the reason they’re expensive is that you have to spend a lot of time with a chronically ill patient,” Meghan O’Rourke, editor of the Yale Review and a chronic illness patient, said on the New York Times’ “Ezra Klein Show” podcast. “These doctors are like detectives. They have to spend a lot of time looking at the patient, looking at the labs, talking to one another.” There are alternatives to medical facilities. Luxury spas and wellness centers around the world are offering long COVID care treatments that focus on learning how to sleep better, eat healthier and gain more energy. For those who can afford the hefty bill (some places charge $10,000 and up for a seven-night program), help could be a flight away to a zen spa in Thailand or former “Magic Mountain” tuberculosis sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland. With those high-end options out of the question, I still desperately wanted to find a one-stop shop that would help coordinate appointments, streamline care and develop a holistic picture of my health. I intended to fight the virus with every resource available. After extensive research, I finally discovered a long COVID care program at Jamaica Hospital, in the Queens borough of New York City, that fit my needs. I remember that hot and humid day in July so vividly — it was the first time in over a year that I actually felt a sense of hope. I wasn’t expecting a miracle, just validation and a little help. I was surrounded by doctors who believed me and wanted to assist, no matter how difficult the journey would be. It felt incredible to have my symptoms validated by clinicians, some of whom were battling long COVID as well. Finally, someone who just “gets it.” Despite bad fatigue, I traveled to London a month later to meet with two long COVID experts in an effort to complement the treatment I was receiving stateside. It was a profound experience that led me to trying new medications, getting proper rehabilitation and learning effective coping strategies. I met specialists with a passion for getting to the bottom of this novel illness. During a stop in Italy, I also discovered the incredible health benefits of yoga and meditation. I felt physically stronger, less fatigued and at peace after one session at a retreat overlooking Lago di Occhito, a beautiful lake nestled in the mountainous Molise region. But I was still struggling cognitively. I found it quite difficult to coordinate all the necessary documents and meet deadlines. I was required to submit a new doctor’s note every 14 days to work; to qualify for FMLA, I needed a clinician to fill out an extensive form and fax it back to the proper officials within a short time period. I became the biggest pest to medical offices as I tried to get answers and coordinate the process — a draining experience for anyone, but especially a chronically ill person. It took a lot of patience and an assist from my overprotective Italian mother to get everything sorted. I also looked into short-term disability aid. In July, President Biden announced that long COVID would now be considered a disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act. But I soon discovered that applying for — and actually getting approved for — disability insurance is incredibly difficult. I ultimately gave up on the process knowing that I’d most likely get denied. The last thing I wanted was more disappointment. So now I wait and endure — desperately clinging to the hope that research quickly catches up to all of us chronic illness sufferers living at the edge of medical science.

2/4/2022,"Bezos' new, 417-foot megayacht is being built near Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Dutch media reported hat a 100-year-old bridge would be dismantled so Bezos' yacht can leave port. But the mayor of Rotterdam said an application was yet to be made, and Bezos may have to pay to dismantle the bridge. The mayor of Rotterdam denied reports that the Dutch city was dismantling a historic bridge to make way for Jeff Bezos' new superyacht to pass. Dutch media reported Wednesday that a section of the nearly 100-year-old Koningshaven Bridge would be removed to allow Bezos' new 417-foot yacht to reach the ocean. The existence of the megayacht Y721, which is being constructed in the nearby city of Alblasserda, was first reported by the journalist Brad Stone last May. Stone reported that the yacht was costing the Amazon founder $500 million to build. However, Ahmed Aboutaleb, the major of Rotterdam, said Thursday that no decision had been made to dismantle the bridge and, if it happens, that Bezos or his shipbuilder Oceanco may need to foot the bill. ""No decision has yet been taken, not even an application for a permit,"" Aboutaleb said Thursday, the Algemeen Dagblad reported. Aboutaleb said it doesn't matter that the world's second richest man is involved. ""That has absolutely nothing to do with this decision. It's about the facts. I want to know them first,"" he said, according to the paper. The first images of what is thought to be Bezos' megayacht surfaced in October, showing it had three masts that wouldn't fit under the 131-foot clearance afforded by the bridge. Frances van Heijst, a spokesperson for the municipality of Rotterdam, previously told Insider that the city is able to grant permission to the maritime sector to take a ship to sea. But van Heijst told The Washington Post that Oceanco would have to pay for the cost of dissembling the bridge if permission is granted. Oceanco and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. According to Stone, Bezos has also commissioned a smaller ""support yacht"" from Oceanco. Both boats are due for completion in 2022, Boat International reported. A Facebook group calling on Rotterdam residents to hurl rotten eggs at Bezos boat as it passes through the city has garnered hundreds of positive responses, BN DeStem reported.

2/4/2022,"
 Mike Pence will be in the spotlight on Friday afternoon when the former vice president is expected to address ex-President Trump's most recent attacks on his handling of the 2020 election. It's unclear exactly how far Pence will go, but tensions between Pence and Trump are on the rise as the 2024 campaign season edges closer and both men flirt with the possibility of running for the nation's highest office. A preview of the Federalist Society event in Florida says that Pence ""will deliver remarks about constitutional principles and the rule of law,"" but aides said Trump's comments about overturning the election will likely come up. Pence was the consummate loyalist to Trump as vice president, but the Jan. 6 riot has emerged as something of a breaking point as he charts his own path into 2024 and beyond. Trump turned his fire on Pence in a pair of statements this week, first declaring the former vice president should have unilaterally overturned the outcome of the 2020 election, and later suggesting the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 riot should be probing why Pence did not reject the results. In a statement Sunday evening, Trump hammered Pence's handling of that process in January of last year, shortly after President Biden's 2020 victory, lamenting that his former vice president ""could have overturned the Election"" but opted not to. In a subsequent statement issued Tuesday, Trump complained that the House panel should instead focus its efforts, in part, on ""why Mike Pence did not send back the votes for recertification or approval, in that it has now been shown that he clearly had the right to do so!"" he added."" Pence has previously acknowledged he and Trump may ""never see eye-to-eye"" on the events of that day, and he has expressed pride in Congress finishing the certification process after the riot. The former president's ire comes at a time when Pence and his team are moving farther away from Trump and positioning themselves for a possible 2024 run. Multiple former Pence aides have cooperated with the House committee investigating Jan. 6, a point that certainly isn't lost on the former president, who puts out statements on a near-daily basis hammering the select committee. Those contacts have almost certainly contributed to animosity and tensions between those in the Pence and Trump camps. Marc Short, Pence's former chief of staff, sat down with the committee late last month for an interview. Greg Jacob, who served as general counsel to Pence, spoke with the committee days later. Both were top aides for Pence during his time in the White House and could provide critical information about what was happening in the vice president's orbit in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021. ""Trump should be worried. Out of any of these people from the Mike Pence team, Greg Jacob's integrity is unwavering,"" tweeted Olivia Troye, a former Pence homeland security aide who has since become an outspoken Trump critic. ""He was never one to do Trump's bidding & he's always known what's at stake for our country."" Trump has gone after Pence before, including the day of the Jan. 6 riots as the then-vice president was being escorted to safety and a mob was running through the building. In an interview with ABC's Jon Karl last year, he downplayed rioters calling for Pence to be hanged. His attention returned to Pence this week as the Jan. 6 panel continues its probe, and as a group of senators discuss reforms that would prevent a vice president from single-handedly rejecting electoral results in the future. The tensions between team Trump and team Pence over Jan. 6 underscore the degree to which the Capitol riot has turned into a defining issue for Republicans, including those who might be seeking the 2024 nomination. Pence is widely seen as positioning himself for a potential run, holding events in early primary states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina since leaving office. He has sought to blend the accomplishments of the Trump administration with his own spin on conservatism, suggesting Republicans should be putting forward a positive agenda for voters to get behind. But strategists widely agree his actions on Jan. 6, which Trump and many of his supporters view as a betrayal, will follow him to the campaign trail should he run and could be his undoing in the long run. ""He has to appeal to the Trump-wing of the party because they're rabid and without them he can't proceed forward, but they won't think he's loyal,"" a former Trump administration official said. ""But he also has to appeal to another larger segment of the Republican Party that kind of wants to move beyond Trump and move to a different phase. Trying to bridge both sides of that divide can end up tanking a person's chances.""",Politics/The Hill,"Pence, Trump tensions rise, raising questions about a break",https://news.yahoo.com/pence-trump-tensions-rise-raising-110024934.html
