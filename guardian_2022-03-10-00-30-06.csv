3/10/2022,"Lord Lisvane, one of three complainants in the successful bullying claim against John Bercow, has said the former Speaker’s protests against the verdict have “not a shred of credibility”, as he praised the system that allowed a historical case to be brought. Lisvane, a former clerk of the House of Commons, criticised Bercow’s “farcical” refusal to accept the verdict of the panel, calling it “hysterical petulance from someone caught bang to rights”. He also backed the system that allowed historical complaints against Bercow to be investigated, exposing a pattern of serial bullying over a long period of time. He said the process had been “forensically exacting” and the complainants came forward when they did because it was a “credible impartial process” that was extended in 2019 to cover historical complaints. Parliament is moving to impose a one-year time limit on complaints against MPs and their staff under the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which will come into force on 28 April. Under the new rules, there could not have been an investigation into Bercow, who was found by the independent expert panel to have been a “serial bully” and to be a “serial liar” in his dealings with the investigation. In an excoriating verdict on Bercow’s conduct during a decade as Speaker, the independent panel found his behaviour “fell very far below that which the public has a right to expect from any member of parliament”. It upheld 21 out of 35 complaints against him by former staff. Lisvane, a crossbench peer, said he had experienced “an overwhelming sense of relief” after the verdict, because the inquiry took more than two years. Bercow was found to have repeatedly ranted at Lisvane, making “unfounded criticism”. Bercow has said the process was unfair, describing it as “feeble conclusions reached [that] would be torn to shreds in any judicial process”. He told Channel 4: “I deny the allegations that have been levelled at me in the course of a protracted, unjust, and amateurish process. It’s been a kangaroo court and saying it’s a kangaroo court is extremely insulting to kangaroos.” But Lisvane said Bercow’s protests against the verdict “had absolutely no foundation in truth”, in particular the idea that the complainants were standing in the way of reforms when he had personally “spent my entire career trying to make parliament better understood” and was supportive of diversity. “When somebody is caught bang to rights, as has happened in this case, you get a lot of whining and whingeing about how it isn’t fair, they didn’t do it and it’s all a stitch up and so on,” he said. “The fact is that the panel also regard him as a serial liar and somebody who attempted to defeat the complaints by false accusations of collusion, and by advancing lies, quite simply deliberate lies, in a vain attempt to excuse the inexcusable. His shouting foul doesn’t carry a shred of credibility,’” he said. Lisvane also highlighted the report’s statement that Bercow mimicked the complainants in an interview with the investigator. “It is extraordinary. He is a very good mimic. Once it may be funny, but if it is repeated with the aim of humiliation then it is not funny,” he added. The other two complainants with complaints upheld were the former staffers Angus Sinclair and Kate Emms. It comes after Lt Gen David Leakey, a former Black Rod, said JBercow should be barred from holding public office or positions of leadership. Leakey, who made one of the complaints against Bercow and acted as a witness to others, said he had been determined to ensure Bercow’s record was examined fully. Leakey said no public institution should give Bercow a position while he refused to show any contrition for his behaviour. Leakey’s own complaint against Bercow was not upheld and he conceded there were no third-party witnesses, but he gave detailed witness testimony of Bercow’s bullying of other staff to the inquiry. Bercow, who joined the Labour party after leaving parliament, was reported to be considering a run for London mayor after Sadiq Khan’s term is over. Labour has since suspended him from the party. He is a professor of politics at Royal Holloway, University of London, and until last year was the chancellor of the University of Essex. A spokesperson for Bercow said on Tuesday he had “never sought or wanted” to be London mayor. The independent panel that examined the findings of parliament’s standards commissioner concluded that at least 21 complaints against him could be upheld. It banned him from holding a parliamentary pass and said he could have been expelled from the Commons if still an MP.",News/Politics,John Bercow protests over bullying verdicts have ‘not a shred of credibility’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/john-bercow-protests-bullying-verdicts-not-shred-of-credibility-lord-lisvane
3/10/2022,"Vladimir Putin is able to finance his war machine thanks to EU payments for Russian gas and oil, the bloc’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has said. Speaking in the European parliament, the Spanish former foreign minister told MEPs that the west should have acted more quickly in the face of Russian aggression over the last decade. Putin felt that the US was distracted by the risk of China, Borrell said, and the Russian president was confident that the EU would not be able to dispense with the country’s oil and gas. Borrell told MEPs that Putin had been wrong in believing the west would fracture, but he admitted that the EU had a lamentable record when it came to its dependency on Russia’s fossil fuels. “It’s true,” Borrell said. “We are affected by our energy ties. When it comes to oil and gas, we are paying the equivalent of the amount of assets that have been frozen owned by the Russian central bank. “So, the first thing that we need to do is to cut the umbilical cord. We need to stop these flows that allow them to gain assets to finance this war. “That means that by the end of the year, we will have cut our dependence on Russian energy by two-thirds. It is a difficult objective but something which is achievable if we really put our minds to it. “It means that European citizens need to turn the heat down in their houses. Everybody needs to make an individual effort when it comes to cutting use.” In 2021, the EU imported 155bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia, accounting for about 45% of its gas imports and close to 40% of the bloc’s total gas consumption. Borrell added: “We started too late, but it is better late than never. When we saw the invasion, in Crimea, we knew we had to reduce our dependence on Russian energy, but actually we only increased it instead of decreasing it. “The Russian economy is not that interlinked with the global economy. It is basically pumping out gas. And it uses money from these energy transactions to fund its military to expand its influence where it can, to the Caucasus, now to Ukraine.” After the US and UK announced a ban on Russian oil imports on Tuesday, EU leaders will discuss a similar move when they meet in Versailles on Thursday, but are not expected to follow, because of Europe’s dependence on imported Russian fossil fuels. “The US has a different reality when it comes to imports from Russia,” a senior EU official said. The US gets just 8% of its oil from Russia and does not buy any natural gas, while the EU imports about a quarter of its oil from its eastern neighbour. Instead, EU leaders are to agree “to phase out our dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports”, according to a draft summit communique, without setting a date to this pledge. “Some [member states] are asking for 2030, some are asking for 2027, some are saying now. So that is why we do not intend to put a date, because I think some member states might meet this target earlier,” the EU official said. Earlier this week, the European Commission outlined how the EU could cut its use of Russian gas by two-thirds this year and completely “well before” the end of the decade. However, the plan depends on EU member states speeding up plans for net zero emissions by 2050, as well as ramping up expensive purchases of liquefied natural gas in the short term.",News/World news,"Buying Russian gas and oil has funded Putin’s war, says top EU official",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/russian-gas-oil-vladimir-putin-war-europe-eu-official
3/10/2022,"The UN has urged Ukraine to take a “compassionate and humane” approach to the enforcement of martial law after reports of Ukrainian men defying orders to stay and attempting to cross into neighbouring countries to claim asylum. Men of conscription age, aged 18 to 60, were banned from leaving Ukraine after the Russian invasion on 24 February but there have been multiple reports of men with Ukrainian citizenship trying to cross into Hungary, Poland and Romania. It is unclear how many have been allowed to pass. The Ukrainian government is not forcing men to fight, only remain in the country, but there are fears of enforced conscription if the violence continues. According to reports from aid workers, many of those trying to leave were not born in Ukraine and were in the country for work or family reasons when the war began. The Guardian spoke with one man who was born in Belarus and lived in Germany before taking Ukrainian citizenship to work in the country. “I am not from Ukraine originally and this is not my war,” says Alexander, who did not want his real name to be used. “I lived in Germany and Poland and I’m a holder of a Polish residence card, which means I can live in Poland for up to 10 years. But because I’m a Ukrainian citizen, I can’t leave. I’m desperate. I am not a coward but I have no blood connection with Ukraine. I managed to talk to the Polish authorities who said they cannot do anything because it is up to the Ukrainian authorities. I have a wife and son but she doesn’t want to leave without me.” He said he didn’t want to try to cross the border into Poland for fear of being arrested by Ukrainian authorities. “I know many [men] are attempting to cross. Many of them are paying smugglers to cross. I heard some people made it to Poland but the majority failed. They have been stopped or arrested. And I don’t know about the destiny of those who have been arrested.” More than 1 million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the start of the Russian invasion, including 142,300 on Sunday alone, the Polish border force has said. The village of Medyka, in south-east Poland, is the main border crossing with Ukraine. Thousands of refugees are crossing every day by bus, car and on foot, mostly women and children. The mass exodus is causing severe queues at the border, with lines of people and cars stretching to 14km and waiting times of up to 40 hours. According to refugees on the Ukrainian side of the border, waiting times are being exacerbated by the Ukrainian authorities, which are checking everyone trying to cross to ensure no men with Ukrainian nationality are passing through. “We recognise that states have a right to self-defence under both the UN charter and customary international law and that states may also require their citizens to perform military service under certain criteria and conditions, in line with international law,” said Matthew Saltmarsh, head of news and media at UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. “At the same time … we appreciate these are very challenging circumstances and we would urge a compassionate and humane approach to those who are seeking to flee and are in need of safety and protection.” After martial law was introduced, the Ukrainian interior minister posted on the Telegram messaging app: “Today is the moment when every Ukrainian who can protect his home must take up arms. Not just to help our soldiers, but to cleanse Ukraine of the enemy, once and for all.” Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men have volunteered to fight since the Russian invasion began. The Polish border force, under enormous pressure in what has become Europe’s fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of the second world war, says the Ukrainian ban doesn’t apply to Poland and the country is happy to welcome any person leaving Ukraine, regardless of gender. Authorities in Poland also suggested that Ukrainian men who have crossed the border did not need to apply for asylum. “For us, everybody is equal at the border,” said Piotr Zakielarz, spokesperson for the force’s southern department. Zakielarz said that, so far, Polish border authorities had no idea how many men had crossed. “We don’t go through the statistics. At this moment, I don’t care about the statistics.” Under Ukrainian law there are exceptions to the ban on men leaving the country. Male Ukrainian nationals can cross the border if they are financially supporting three or more children under the age of 18, are single fathers of children under 18, or have children or are guardians of children with disabilities.

3/10/2022,"The EU has imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 160 more Russians, including 14 oligarchs and their families, as the bloc seeks to further squeeze individuals closest to Vladimir Putin. Those targeted, who have yet to be named, are said by EU officials to provide a substantial source of revenue to the Russian Federation in the metallurgical, agriculture, pharmaceutical, telecom and digital industries. In the new round of sanctions, 146 members of the Russian senate who ratified a treaty recognising the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk are also hit. The EU’s sanctions policy is driven by a desire to increase the pressure on those who have enriched themselves under Putin’s leadership to encourage them to act against the Russian president. Alexander Lukashenko’s regime in Belarus is also now captured by the EU’s “restrictive measures” because of his government’s help to Putin’s invading forces. Four Belarusian banks have been cut off from the Swift payments system, while transactions are now prohibited with the Central Bank of Belarus. The EU has already blocked seven Russian banks from Swift, and leaders of the 27 member states will debate taking further measures against Sberbank and Gazprombank, the vehicles of gas and oil payments, when they meet in Versailles on Thursday, officials said. EU restrictive measures now apply to 862 individuals and 53 entities. As with Russians, the EU has now banned Belarusian citizens from depositing more than €100,000 in European banks. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign policy, said: “With these additional sectoral sanctions, we are sending a strong message: the unprovoked and unjustified military aggression waged against Ukraine by the Putin regime with assistance by Lukashenko comes at a high price. “We are closing the loopholes of our existing sanctions and imposing further measures on Belarus’s financial sector.” An EU official said all the evidence suggested sanctions were having the desired effect on the Russian economy. “You know, that the Russian stock exchange is closed, the credit rating agencies have downgraded Russian government bonds quite drastically,” the official said. “The rouble has lost more than a third of its value. Interest rates in Russia have been doubled. We have also seen the reaction of private companies in Russia.”",News/World news,EU imposes travel bans and asset freezes on a further 160 Russians,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/eu-imposes-travel-bans-asset-freezes-russians-oligarchs-putin
3/10/2022,"The irony was not lost on some of the Muscovites who were queueing outside a McDonald’s on Tuesday evening, just after the company announced it was temporarily closing its nearly 850 locations in Russia. “My dad once told me how he waited in a long line when McDonald’s opened when he was young. And now I ended up also queueing, but for a very different reason. History can be funny,” said Dmitry Grigoryev. When McDonald’s opened its doors in Moscow’s Pushkin Square in 1990, a queue thousands-long formed. Inside and outside the country, the arrival of the golden arches was seen as a definite sign of the end of cold war. Russians’ embrace of western fast food, pop culture and jeans came to signify the country’s integration into the global capitalist system. Despite rising authoritarianism under Vladimir Putin over the last decade, international brands remained eager to keep their doors open in Moscow and other big cities with a sizable middle class. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the morning of 24 February changed everything. Since then there has been an unparalleled exit of international firms, among them Toyota, Heineken, Nike, Apple, Exxon, Ford, Zara, Netflix and Ikea. “The exodus of companies is really stunning,” said Maria Shagina, an international sanctions specialist at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs and the Geneva International Sanctions Network. “The speed at which this is happening is unknown to modern history. Russia is being completely decoupled from the global commercial, technological and banking communities.” Shagina said western sanctions, such as the decoupling of some Russian banks from the Swift system and new export controls, would have complicated the operations of western firms. But she said the majority of the companies that suspended their operations had done so out of reputational concerns, given how deeply unpopular the war has been in the west. “Of course, the Kremlin expected that the west would impose sanctions, but I am not sure they expected just how toxic Russia would become. These companies are not just leaving because of sanctions, but primarily because they believe that Russia is uninvestable right now. That it is not right to do business there.” In a sign that Russian officials might have not expected such a dramatic outflow of companies, a senior official in Russia’s ruling political party called for the operations of western companies that had left the country to be nationalised. “This is an extreme measure, but we will not tolerate stabs in the back, and we will defend our people,” said the leader of United Russia, Andrey Turchak, in a statement posted on the party’s website. Turchak said that such a move would help prevent job losses and maintain Russia’s ability to produce goods domestically. It is not just the mass market industry that has taken a hit. Footage on social media posted on Monday showed empty halls at Moscow’s upscale shopping centre Tsum, which is popular with Russia’s wealthy elite. Practically all major fashion brands, including Burberry, Hermès, Gucci, Chanel and Louis Vuitton, have temporarily stopped their operations. On Monday Condé Nast said it was suspending its publishing activities. “I think Russians are in a state of shock as their world is falling apart at lightning speed, said Katya Fedorova, who runs a widely read fashion and lifestyle blog on Telegram. “Many do not yet understand just how much the sanctions will affect them and their daily lives in the coming months. “But the scariest part is not luxury brands exiting. It’s mass-market brands like Mothercare leaving the country, with very few Russian substitutes available. It’s absolutely insane how the Russian government has managed to destroy all the connections that were built with the international retail industry for 30 years in just 10 days.” Analysts have offered a bleak forecast of Russia’s economic prospects. The Institute for International Finance last week predicted a 15% contraction in Russia’s GDP in 2022, double the decline from the global financial crisis. “We see risks as tilted to the downside. Russia will never be the same again,” wrote the IIF’s chief economist, Robin Brooks. For now, McDonald’s and Ikea say they will keep their staff on the payroll. But experts like Shagina believe the scale of the foreign exodus will probably lead to an immediate rise in unemployment, even before the impact of western sanctions has been felt. “We are only [in] the second week, sanctions need time to really bite,” Shagina said. Russia’s rouble has already fallen dramatically since the start of the war, losing half its value against the dollar and euro. The stock market has been shut since the invasion. Morgan Stanley on Monday said Russia could face a default on its debts as soon as next month. Shagina said she expected sanctions to drive inflation higher while crippling Russia’s purchasing power. A major recession paired with the exodus of western brands could significantly alter the daily life of average Russians, Shagina said. “Russia will be going back to the 90s, and that wasn’t a particularly stable time for most,” she said.",News/World news,‘History can be funny’: Muscovites get used to life without Dior and McDonald’s,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/history-can-be-funny-muscovites-get-used-to-life-without-dior-and-mcdonalds

Please do the money count somewhere else. I’d like to be discreet.” The transaction triggered an alarm, according to the report, and bank staff called the police. Coogler and two other people with him were arrested, and later released. Coogler told Variety: “This situation should never have happened … However, Bank of America worked with me and addressed it to my satisfaction and we have moved on.” Prior to global blockbuster Black Panther, which was released in 2018, Coogler directed Rocky spin-off Creed in 2015, starring Michael B Jordan and Sylvester Stallone, and his 2013 directorial debut Fruitvale Station, about a real-life police killing that also featured Jordan in the lead role.",Arts/Film,Black Panther director Ryan Coogler arrested after being mistaken for bank robber,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/09/black-panther-director-ryan-coogler-arrested-mistaken-bank-robber
3/10/2022,"A third of households in Britain were spending more than their income before the coronavirus pandemic, according to official figures that highlight the precarious financial situation millions of people were in before the cost of living crisis hit. Just under half of these households had a financial buffer that would last for less than a year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) report based on data for the two years before the pandemic. With households facing a record increase in energy bills when the price cap rises next month, the report said increasing costs “tend to have a disproportionate impact on lower-income households and their spending”. While some households may be able to maintain higher levels of spending by drawing on financial buffers they have accumulated, the ONS warned that “others have less to fall back on and may need to make cutbacks, or borrow, to make up the shortfall”. Of those working-age people who lived alone, 57% spent more than their income. This was the highest percentage among household types and they were typically able to cover the shortfall for an average of three to four months. With household budgets stretched by surging food and energy costs, the report, based on data gathered in official surveys, estimated that 2 million households – or one in 14 – were in poverty for income, spending and financial wealth before the pandemic. A household is in income poverty when their disposable income is less than 60% of the national average for similar households. Likewise, they are in spending poverty if their expenditure is less than 60% of the average. Financial wealth poverty is where a household, in the event of losing all their income including government benefits, cannot bring in enough money to keep them above the income poverty line for three months. Financial wealth includes cash, savings and shares but excludes property and private pensions. Of the three measures, households were most commonly in financial wealth poverty, with this group put at 11 million. The data lays bare the financial struggles experienced by vast swathes of the UK population, said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at the website Interactive Investor. “The financial squeeze that many experienced pre-Covid has turned into a stranglehold today amid the once-in-a-generation style rise in the cost of living,” said Jobson. Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at financial firm AJ Bell, said the figures are deeply concerning. “They show that many people in the UK don’t have enough income to cover their expenditure and lack the financial resources to deal with any emergencies,” he said. He said that while those without reserves may be fine while the labour market is strong, “if the Ukraine crisis and the consequent rise in energy costs prompts a global recession, unemployment could rise, and many people would be cut adrift without a financial lifeboat”.

3/10/2022,"When a friend recently told me that there was a 10-week waiting list to have a copper coil fitted, my shock turned quickly into anger. Ten weeks is a hell of a long time to wait for adequate, hormone-free, affordable contraception. To put it into context, that means anyone who had asked for a coil fitting on 29 December – surrounded by Quality Street and the Christmas Radio Times – would be coming up to their appointment just about now. Someone requesting one today might hopefully get an appointment by 18 May. What, precisely, are you meant to do in the meantime? As is so often the case with women’s health, that’s your problem. We are experiencing a quiet crisis in contraceptive care in this country. Lives are being jack-knifed off course by the kind of policies that are often only discussed in corners, with close friends. Perhaps this was always going to be the result, not just of living through a pandemic, but of living under a government that has continually cut funding to sexual health services. According to a report by the Advisory Group on Contraception: “Going into lockdown, services had faced years of budget cuts by the government, leading to an 18% decrease in real-terms contraception spend since 2015.” The same report points out that there has also been a huge reduction in sites commissioned to deliver contraception (26% of local authorities cut sites in 2018-2019), meaning people are having to travel further to get the medical help they need, simply not to have an unplanned, unwanted, unaffordable or unsafe pregnancy. I have heard of one woman who was told she would have to travel 93 miles for an abortion, only to turn up and find the doctor wasn’t in, so she had to wait a further two weeks for an appointment in a different city. In the end, the whole process took so long that she went from needing a medical abortion – two pills, taken a few days apart – to a surgical abortion. Talking of pregnancy, you would be excused for missing the significant changes in abortion services over the past few years. For example, you may not have noticed that a large number of abortions are now handled by a charity, rather than the NHS. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) helps, in its own words, “100,000 women a year access reproductive healthcare services including pregnancy counselling, abortion care, miscarriage management and contraception at clinics across Great Britain”. I am in favour of anything that makes access to early abortion easier, faster and friendlier. But I can’t help but wonder why such an essential medical service is being handled by a charity. I may be talking rubbish here, but it’s not as if your council tax is processed by Shelter or your warfarin is prescribed by the British Heart Foundation. During lockdown, BPAS was – after some rather confusing government messaging – allowed to provide “telemedicine” as a temporary measure. Essentially, it was able to send out the pills necessary to terminate a pregnancy following a phone consultation. No need to go to the doctor, no need for an ultrasound. But sadly, as Vicky Spratt has reported for the website Refinery29, on 24 February the government announced that it would be scrapping at-home early medical abortions after 29 August. Why this change? Especially when access to in-person services has become harder, thanks to BPAS closing some of its physical clinics after the move to telemedicine. Well, it’s because, as Spratt puts it, “anti-abortion campaigners are more vocal than people who are in favour of abortion”. When it comes to courting public approval – and this government seems to do little else – restraining access to abortion will always play out well with a very vocal minority. As a parent, I would genuinely like to know what the anti-abortion lobby would like us to do with our unplanned and unwanted pregnancies; I would like to know who is going to look after those children and parents. Here is a list of just some of the people who are likely to have needed an abortion in the last year: a nurse; the woman bringing you a plate of beans on toast on Sunday morning; the person who delivers your shopping; the woman who looks after your kids on Tuesdays and Thursdays; the mum at the school gates with navy boots; that woman at the gym who wears a T-shirt advertising an investment bank; your daughter. According to the Office for National Statistics, 25.2% of conceptions in England and Wales in 2019 ended in abortion. That’s just over one in four. Unfortunately, the stigma still attached to contraception and reproductive health means people are less willing to complain publicly about the huge waiting times, the travel costs and the difficulty they face in accessing contraception and abortion. Subtly and overtly, we are told that this is our lot and we must bear it. After all, there are plenty of people out there ready to whip our reproductive rights out from under us. Which makes it easier for government to keep cutting funding. Continually making small slices, from every side, scraping bits off with a fingernail, breaking off whole corners, then putting it back in the fridge, hoping nobody notices that it is now half the size it should be.

3/10/2022,"With Red Rocket, Sean Baker has given us an adult American pastoral, essentially a comedy, and another study of tough lives at the margin, close in spirit to his lo-fi breakthrough Tangerine. Actor, rapper, comedian and one-time porn performer Simon Rex gives an amusing performance as a washed-up adult movie actor with the unsubtle professional name of Mikey Saber. Mikey’s career in LA has gone south, chiefly because he had regular work in the spoof sex franchise The Fast and Fury Ass – but as the porn version of the character played by Paul Walker, whose death put a catastrophic downer on Mikey’s career. Now, with no money and sporting cuts and bruises from unexplained disputes with various business associates, Mikey is sheepishly returning to his home town of Texas City, Texas, where he infuriates and astonishes his abandoned wife and former leading lady in the local porn scene, Lexi (Bree Elrod), by asking if he can crash with her for a couple of days. After an unconvincing attempt to get a respectable job in one of the city’s various fast-food outlets, Mikey starts dealing weed, while resuming conjugal relations with Lexi and regaling everyone with stories about the glamorous porn career he intends shortly to resume. But then Mikey finds himself falling in love with Strawberry (Suzanna Son), a young woman who works at the doughnut store. He is convinced she is a porn natural and his ticket back to the triple-X big time. The year happens to be 2016, when Hillary Clinton is facing off with Donald Trump for the US presidency, but it is tempting to read Mikey as the embodiment of Trump right now in 2021, in retreat from a disaster, brooding on his imminent return. This is vivid, real-life film-making, without the need of an epic budget. Amusingly, when the plot calls for a multi-vehicle pileup, Baker shows us Mikey’s car going out of control, then cuts to the aftermath and reuses what appears to be genuine TV news footage of mangled cars on the freeway. Mikey is a fast-talking hustler who has the predator-parasite’s instinct for drawing other people into his orbit, and convincing them that his interests are their interests. However, he is often far from successful in this, and there is an awful moment when he is savagely beaten up by the parents of Strawberry’s ex-boyfriend. But for all this, there is something poignant and even sympathetic about Mikey and Strawberry, and Baker lets us see that it would be sad if they wound up back in Texas City, but also just as sad if they made it to Los Angeles. You can picture Mikey growing old like the local people in Texas City, who are so very unimpressed to see him back.

3/10/2022,"A series of lawsuits against plastic producers and governments is expected after a “historic” international agreement on waste, say legal experts. Last week, world leaders agreed to draw up a legally binding treaty over the next two years that covered the full lifecycle of plastics from production to disposal. The move was described by the head of the UN Environment Programme as the most important multilateral environmental deal since the Paris agreement in 2015. And, like its climate counterpart, the new treaty could provide an essential tool to hold governments and companies accountable for their environmental impacts. An imminent case in the Philippines could set an important precedent. Last year, a coalition of individuals and environmental groups led by the marine conservation group Oceana Philippines filed a petition accusing the Philippine government of failing to tackle the “unabated production, use, and disposal of plastic” over the past two decades. The group claims a law requiring the country’s public waste body to review, update and enforce a list of products that are not environmentally friendly has never been implemented despite being passed in 2001. The result of this, it say, is “the unabated emission of millions of tons of plastic waste into every nook and cranny of the Philippine archipelago”. The petitioners, which include people who are catching fewer fish, having trouble conceiving or being affected by worsening floods aggravated by plastic pollution, say the government’s inaction is breaching their constitutional right to a healthy environment. The Philippine supreme court has accepted the case, which goes to trial later this month. Carroll Muffett, the president of the US-based Center for International Environmental Law, said it was “beyond any doubt” there would be more lawsuits on plastics in future, pointing to the “small but accelerating” body of litigation already in North America. The coffee company Keurig Green Mountain recently agreed settlements in both the US and Canada with a consumer and regulator respectively after being challenged on claims about the recyclability of its disposable coffee pods. The company paid out millions of dollars and has to change the language it uses on its packaging. Earth Island Institute, a California-based environmental group, has filed three separate lawsuits against producers of plastic goods. In 2020, it began sueing Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Nestlé and other large companies for creating a plastic pollution “nuisance”. The following year Earth Island Institute it brought another lawsuit against Coke as well as BlueTriton Brands (formerly Nestlé Waters North America), claiming the companies falsely portrayed themselves as environmentally friendly despite being huge plastic polluters. The companies argue they are all taking action to reduce their plastic use, improve collection and try to find policy resolutions with legislators. All three cases are still pending, but at least two will be heard in state courts, which in general have been more sympathetic than federal courts towards environmental litigants. According to Rosa Pritchard, a plastics lawyer at environmental law charity ClientEarth, plastics-related litigation is already on the rise. “Plastics production – big oil’s plan B – is increasingly in the spotlight for its contribution to climate change.” ClientEarth is taking legal action to stop petrochemicals group Ineos building a giant plastics plant in Belgium, Pritchard said the Paris agreement “had “provided an essential tool” to hold governments and corporations accountable for their contribution to climate change. “A robust treaty on plastics could also have this impact” alongside further waste and climate laws being introduced across Europe, she added. As well as using the law to challenge plastic production, ClientEarth will be focusing its efforts on industry greenwashing. It has already reported Ahold Delhaize, one of the world’s largest grocery retail groups, to the Dutch financial regulator for allegedly failing to disclose key information on the company’s use of plastics or to report plastic-related risk to its investors. The company has said that it reports annually on the progress it is making with regards to reducing its plastic use and is focussing on those areas where it can have a direct impact, such as improving packaging, phasing out single-use plastic and recycling plastic waste from its sites. Muffett sais: “Communities and states affected by plastics are going to be learning from the lessons of climate litigation and looking at the industries and actors that are playing a role in that crisis. A lot of different people are affected in very different ways, and that means the potential avenues for litigation are actually very substantial and very diverse.” In a stark parallel to the misinformation campaigns on climate crisis supported by the fossil fuel industry, Muffett said there was mounting evidence that plastic producers have known for a very long time it accumulated in the environment and that they had sought to shift the blame to consumers: “It’s just a matter of when the additional dots get connected.” Muffett said the commitment to make a legally binding plastics treaty signalled an important shift in political and public debate. “It means that the era of unrestricted plastic production, use and disposal has a limited lifetime, so everyone working in those sectors is going to have to address that reality very soon – and if they fail to do that a new litigation risk will arise.”",News/Environment,Raft of lawsuits over plastic waste expected thanks to ‘historic’ deal,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/lawsuits-plastic-waste-expected-historic-deal
3/10/2022,"A seven-year-old schoolboy has made Holyrood history as he became the youngest person to present a petition to the Scottish parliament in his bid to provide every child in the country with a reusable water bottle. Callum Isted was questioned by MSPs at Wednesday’s Citizen Participation and Petitions committee, where he explained that the petition followed his original campaign to provide all pupils at Dedridge primary in Livingstone, where he goes to school, with reusable water bottles, to replace the single-use plastic bottles they were given on a weekly basis. The primary 3 pupil, who said that his favourite subject at school was “definitely maths”, said he raised £1,405.66 by completing the John Muir Way. “I felt very surprised that I had raised so much money. I earned so much money that I was also able to get some for the adults in the school.” He added that he now wants the Scottish parliament to buy a bottle for everyone. The boy, who was joined at Holyrood by his parents, told the committee: “I wanted to go to Nicola Sturgeon’s house to talk about the bottles but my mum said it wasn’t allowed so we looked online and found the petitions.” He is expected to meet the first minister later on Wednesday. Isted, who took his campaign to the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last November, raised concerns about the littering of single use bottles as well as the danger that microplastics pose to animals and fish. He also noted that broken taps in his school can make it difficult for pupils to refill their bottles. Convenor Jackson Carlaw thanked the boy for his evidence and assured him: “We’re going to take the petition forward and after you meet with the first minister we’ll be asking her to honour whatever commitments you can get and see what we can do to put your petition into practice.”",News/UK news,Schoolboy to make Holyrood history with water bottle campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/schoolboy-to-make-holyrood-history-with-water-bottle-campaign
3/10/2022,"Donald Trump “admired” Vladimir Putin’s ability to kill anyone he wanted, according to his former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. In an interview with The View on Tuesday, Grisham discussed the former US president’s relationship with the Russian president, saying: “I think [Trump] feared [Putin]. I think he was afraid of him. I think that the man intimidated him. Because Putin is a scary man, just frankly, I think he was afraid of him.” She went on to add: “I also think he admired him greatly. I think he wanted to be able to kill whoever spoke out against him. So I think it was a lot of that. In my experience with him, he loved the dictators, he loved the people who could kill anyone, including the press.” Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted in more than 1,300 civilian casualties, including 474 killed and 861 injured, Trump has highly praised Putin for his actions, calling him a “genius”. In an interview last month with a conservative radio show, Trump fawned over Putin, saying: “I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of … Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh that’s wonderful. So Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent,’ a large section of Ukraine. I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s the strongest peace force. We could use that on our southern border.” Trump continued, saying: “There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy, I know him very well. Very, very well.” Trump’s comments were criticized by the two Republicans serving on the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot, who are among the few Republicans who have been critical of the former president. Liz Cheney tweeted that Trump’s statement “aids our enemies. Trump’s interests don’t seem to align with the interests of the United States of America.” ",News/US news," Trump ‘admired’ Putin’s ability to ‘kill whoever’, says Stephanie Grisham",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-stephanie-grisham
3/10/2022,"The Ukrainian anthem has been playing from the medieval tower of Krakow’s most important church, St Mary’s Basilica. St Mary’s Trumpet Call, a traditional bugle call played every hour, gave way to this sign of extraordinary times. In Warsaw’s centre, by contrast, the now famous response to the Russian navy of soldiers defending an island in Ukraine is displayed in Cyrillic script on a huge illuminated sign: “Go fuck yourself.” These are telling symbols of a profound mood change in Poland. Although the war is being waged in Ukraine, from the very beginning its echo has resonated across central and eastern Europe. The refugee exodus from Ukraine to neighbouring countries since 24 February has now reached 1.7 million, according to the UN; two-thirds of those fleeing have arrived in Poland. Russia’s bombardment of so many urban areas in Ukraine means the human tide is rising dramatically. To the astonishment of many, Poland has reacted with open arms. The authorities unlocked the frontier and are admitting anyone in need, virtually irrespective of documents. “Don’t show me your passport,” a conductor at one railway station allegedly said. “I look into the eyes, not at documents.” Aid groups, NGOs, officials and Polish people seem to be working together for the same humanitarian aim. As the Ukrainian writer Anastasia Lapatina wrote in the Guardian of her ordeal, she had expected to find “a human catastrophe” when she made it across the Polish border. Instead, along with hundreds of thousands of others, she met “the best of humanity”. How is it possible that a country previously perceived as the most hostile in Europe to incoming refugees is suddenly the most generous? The sense of disbelief is certainly justified. Since the Syrian refugee crisis of 2015, Poland, governed by the populist Law and Justice party, has opposed plans to share asylum seekers among the member states according to countries’ size. In 2021, Poland deployed armed police and military using force to push back a few thousand people, many of them women and children, but mostly from Afghanistan and Syria. Their arrival at the border with Belarus had been orchestrated by Putin’s ally Alexander Lukashenko. Yet now Poles almost unanimously say they see in Ukrainians “people like us”. It is too easy to misinterpret this as being motivated entirely by sympathy for those who share the same ethnicity, culture or religion. But this unprompted outpouring of compassion and empathy is primarily moulded by geography and shared history. Polish people are reacting to Russia’s assault on Ukraine as if they themselves were at war. These neighbouring countries of the region share a traumatic past and an anxious sense of themselves: their sovereignty feels fragile and nervously held. The faces of fleeing Ukrainians remind Poles of this intertwined past, but also warn of an ominous shared future. The past because central and eastern European states have historically re-established their independence only to lose it moments later. The future because Kyiv, Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, and Warsaw alike are convinced there is such a thing as a new domino effect. “Sooner or later we will be next,” people say. It is a subcutaneous fear of the eventual return of dormant Russian imperialism. With horror we watch as Vladimir Putin again seeks to freeze the region in the past, reimposing the logic of spheres of influence, exactly as in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. By helping Ukraine’s fleeing population, Poles are fighting their own feelings of dread, hoping that if the west can save Ukrainian sovereignty this time, , they too can escape the trap of history. Nervous sovereignty may sound to many like alarmism, but these fears are legitmatedespite Nato and EU membership, as Kaja Kallas, the Estonian prime minister, reminds us often. The fact that in 2022, the Ukrainians are left to fight alone tends to confirm this regional disquiet. To be abandoned by western allies is another regionally shared experience. No wonder that in supermarkets across Poland loudspeakers call on shoppers to drop off food and medicines in special baskets. People rush to the border in private cars and buses to collect Ukrainian refugees and bring them to safety. Rooms in private homes are thrown open to those in need. The Poles call it a “carnival of solidarity”, echoing the grassroots mobilisation that led to the anti-communist trade union in 1980. Many people involved in the aid effort today hope that this new carnival is as transformational politically as the movement was 40 years ago. The German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung called the Polish response a new Willkommenskultur (welcoming culture), a reprise of what happened in Germany during at the start of the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis. In Berlin, Ukrainian flags fly from many buildings too, and Germans willingly offer their homes and cars, but one woman in the German capital told us she thought that this time it was the turn of Poles to show solidarity. And indeed it is. This is how democratic societies build bonds against the destruction of war. In 1947 the US president Harry Truman outlined a new foreign policy doctrine aimed at containing communism, under which any country whose sovereignty came under threat could expect US help. It didn’t quite work out in practice. But a new Truman doctrine for liberal democracies is perhaps needed now, one that is relevant to our times and our world – one that requires new ties of solidarity and compassion to neutralise the aggression of our contemporary dictators. Meanwhile it must be hoped that Poland’s spontaneous reaction marks a humanitarian and political turning point, so that when other war refugees come to our border the door stays open for them too.
