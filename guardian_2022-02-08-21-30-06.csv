2/8/2022,"Tui has said UK customers’ holiday bookings this summer are nearly a fifth higher than before the pandemic, with a rise in long-haul trips to the Caribbean and Cape Verde thanks in part to less strict Covid rules. The travel firm has had a total of 6m bookings for this winter and the summer. In November and December, bookings were affected by the spread of the Omicron variant and fresh Covid-19 restrictions, but Omicron is no longer an issue, its chief executive, Fritz Joussen, said.  Holiday bookings have picked up since the start of the new year, as people grew more confident about travelling and the government relaxed testing requirements for travellers. UK summer bookings are up 19% on the summer of 2019 and Tui expects summer bookings overall to be close to pre-pandemic levels. Joussen said many UK households had accumulated high savings over the pandemic and were eager to travel. Long-haul destinations such as the Caribbean and Cape Verde were popular, he said, and customers are buying more upmarket holiday packages as they want to treat themselves after two years of the pandemic. “People are selecting holidays that are more expensive. Rather than going to the Canaries, they are going to the Caribbean,” Joussen said. Those destinations are also popular because restrictions are tougher in typical destinations such as Spain, which has banned unvaccinated travellers including children over 12. The worsening cost of living crisis “is of course an issue, but at the same time the savings ratio of households is incredibly high”, he added. He said last week bookings returned to the levels before the pandemic, and that many places would be fully booked at Easter. Germany and other European countries are lagging behind the UK. German bookings overall are 20% below pre-pandemic levels, while package holidays are 20% higher. Tui reported revenues of €3.4bn (£2.8bn) for the three months to 30 September, compared with €1.2bn a year earlier, as more people were vaccinated against Covid-19 across Europe and leisure travel bounced back. The company moved closer to breakeven, with a loss before tax of €71m compared with a €836m loss a year earlier.",News/Business,"UK summer holiday bookings up a fifth on pre-Covid levels, Tui says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/uk-summer-holiday-bookings-covid-tui-covid-rules
2/8/2022,"Mitt Romney and his niece, Ronna McDaniel, exchanged texts after the Republican National Committee she chairs called Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his election defeat and the Capitol riot “legitimate political discourse”.  Romney, the Utah senator, 2012 presidential nominee and only Republican to twice vote to convict Trump at his impeachment trials, told reporters on Monday he “expressed his point of view”. The RNC used the controversial language in censuring Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the only Republicans on the House committee investigating January 6. Romney was one of few Republicans to scorn the move, saying: “Shame falls on a party that would censure persons of conscience, who seek truth in the face of vitriol. Honor attaches to Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for seeking truth even when doing so comes at great personal cost.” But he did not mention his personal connection to McDaniel, who stopped using “Romney” in her name after Trump took over her party – according to the Washington Post, at Trump’s request. Romney also said the censure “could not have been a more inappropriate message … so far from accurate as to shock and to make people wonder what we’re thinking”. On Monday, he told reporters he and his niece had since “exchanged some texts”. “I expressed my point of view,” he said. “I think she’s a wonderful person and doing her very best.” He also said McDaniel was “terrific”. Amid criticism, McDaniel claimed “legitimate political discourse” pursued by Trump supporters in service of his lie that his defeat was the result of electoral fraud “had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol” – language not in the formal censure. She also said she had “repeatedly condemned violence on both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, this committee has gone well beyond the scope of the events of that day.” That day, 6 January 2021, Trump supporters who attacked the Capitol – after Trump told them to “fight like hell” – did so in an attempt to stop the vice-president, Mike Pence, certifying electoral college results. Seven people died, more than 100 police officers were hurt and more than 700 people face charges. Eleven members of a far-right militia are charged with seditious conspiracy. Trump has promised pardons for rioters if he is elected again and admitted his aim was to overturn the election. On Friday, Pence reflected prevailing opinion among constitutional scholars when he said Trump was “wrong. I had no right to overturn the election.” Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who led Trump’s impeachment for inciting the insurrection and who sits on the 6 January committee, said: “It’s official. Lincoln’s party of ‘liberty and union’ is now Trump’s party of violence and disunion. “His cultists just called sedition, beating up cops and a coup ‘legitimate political discourse’. They censured Cheney and Kinzinger for not bowing to the orange autocrat. Disgrace.”",News/US news,Romney won’t criticise niece for calling Trump lies and Capitol riot ‘legitimate political discourse’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/mitt-romney-niece-ronna-mcdaniel-trump-capitol-riot-legitimate-political-discourse
2/8/2022,"After nine seasons under the guidance of Daryl Powell, there is a new era at Castleford in 2022. The former Hull FC coach, Lee Radford, has taken the reins in West Yorkshire and that change has resulted in an overhaul of a Tigers squad that struggled last season. Among their new recruits are players such as Joe Westerman and George Lawler, both of whom will have England aspirations. They should help Castleford squeeze into the play-offs.Coach Lee Radford Captain Paul McShane Key player Niall Evalds Last season 7th Prediction 6th  Perpignan witnessed more rugby league history in 2021, as Catalans not only finished top of Super League for the first time but reached their maiden Grand Final. While they ultimately came up short against St Helens, the Dragons have strengthened once again in a bid to go a step further. The signing of State of Origin star Mitchell Pearce, on top of the immense squad already assembled in the south of France, could take Catalans into uncharted territory again.Coach Steve McNamara Captain Benjamin Garcia Key player Mitchell Pearce Last season 1st and Grand Final runners-up Prediction 1st and Grand Final winners Last year was always going to be a formative one for Huddersfield in Ian Watson’s first season in charge. A disappointing ninth-placed finish underlined that, but the Giants have gambled on a new half-back pairing of Theo Fages and Tui Lolohea to thrust them back up the table. Will Pryce, son of the former Great Britain half-back Leon, will be one of the competition’s standout talents too, but with so much quality above them, Huddersfield face a tough task to make the play-offs.Coach Ian Watson Captain Michael Lawrence Key player Theo Fages Last season 9th Prediction 8th It was a year of frustration for Hull FC in 2021. One of the competition’s biggest spenders failed to deliver on the field and Brett Hodgson faces a significant challenge to change that given the strength of the teams at the top. There have been some impressive signings including the former England scrum-half, Luke Gale, but a lack of depth in the pack could be the thing that prevents Hull from challenging again.Coach Brett Hodgson Captain Luke Gale Key player Jake Connor Last season 8th Prediction 9th The surprise package of Super League in 2021, Hull KR look in a strong position to push for the play-offs again this year. They have made one of the signings of the winter in convincing multiple Super League winner Lachlan Coote from St Helens, and their young squad will only be better for the experiences of last year. They are in a tussle with several other teams to make the top six, but history has shown they are entirely capable of doing so.Coach Tony Smith Captain Shaun Kenny-Dowall Key player Lachlan Coote Last season 6th Prediction 7th Last season injuries and suspensions forced Leeds into blooding a number of young players potentially before their time. But that should stand them in good stead, with the Rhinos looking to go one step further than last year’s exit in the play-off semi-finals.

For the first time in several years there has been major surgery on their strongest side, with mainstays such as Lachlan Coote, Theo Fages and James Bentley departing.

They have lost key playmaker Johnathon Ford, and recruitment has not quite been as impressive as some expected. They will undoubtedly benefit from the fact travel to France will be complicated in the early months of the season, and should pick up some wins. But an instant return to the Championship seems likely.Coach Sylvain Houles Captain Tony Gigot Key player Tony Gigot Last season Promoted Prediction 12th While Wakefield have made some signings that have strengthened a squad that struggled throughout parts of 2021, this season looks like it will be another battle for Trinity.

Next up: Unbeaten Italy go for curling gold, the women’s luge concludes and then tomorrow we get the Nordic combined and the start of the men’s ice hockey.  Eileen Gu is poised to emerge as the biggest American breakout star of these Games – while competing under the Chinese flag. She took gold today in the women’s freestyle big air putting down the first 1620 of her career – a four-and-a-half-revolution manoeuvre she admitted never even attempting in training before. France’s Tess Ledeux delivered a double 1620 – the largest rotation ever seen in women’s freeski – but could only take silver in the end. Team GB’s Kirsty Muir finished fifth in an event which was watched by the tennis star Peng Shuai, who was the guest of the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach. There was a gripping day’s racing on the snowboards in the parallel giant slalom. Ester Ledecka took gold for the Czech Republic and retained her title in the women’s competition. In 2018 she became the first competitor to win gold in two different sports at the same Winter Games, and on Friday she will attempt to retain her Alpine skiing Super-G title. “It’s a little bit difficult because part of my head is still racing right now on that course, and the other side of my head is already trying to get through the line on the skiing course” the 26-year-old said afterwards. Benjamin Karl of Austria triumphed in the men’s race. Quentin Fillon Maillet of France won the men’s 20km biathlon. A clean shooting round from Anton Smolski of Belarus propelled him to a surprise silver medal. He was one of only two of the 92 competing athletes to achieve it. The British pair of Jen Dodds and Bruce Mouat missed out on a medal after Sweden’s Almida De Val and Oskar Eriksson secured a convincing 9-3 victory with two ends to spare in the mixed doubles curling bronze-medal match. Nathan Chen set a world record during his short programme, scoring 113.97 points to break the previous mark set by longtime rival Yuzuru Hanyu. The final is on Thursday. Mexico’s Donovan Carrillo has advanced too – a first for the country. Canada will top Group A and be the No 1 seeds going into the women’s ice hockey knockout stage after they defeated USA 4-2 in the morning’s first game, which is likely to have been a dress rehearsal for the eventual final. Japan beat the Czech Republic in a shootout to top Group B as both sides progress. A regulation time win for either Sweden or Denmark in tonight’s final Group B match will enable them to seal the last quarter-final berth. I can’t have been the only person hoping mixed team ski jumping meant people jumping simultaneously in formation, right? But that’s not how it worked at all. Late yesterday Slovenia took the inaugural gold. ROC were second, Canada third, and lots of people were left unhappy about how officials applied the rules and expelled jumpers for wearing the wrong suits. There was a controversial end to the men’s 1,000m short track yesterday too. China’s Ren Ziwei appeared to haul back Hungary’s Shaolin Sándor Liu on the line. The Hungarian fell, still just about went over first and celebrated his gold medal. But then a video review penalised him for an earlier infringement, so China ended up with a Ren Ziwei-Li Wenlong gold-silver one-two.

2/8/2022,"When Boris Johnson was seeking re-election as London mayor in 2012, the mood was bleak. Three months before the vote, the Tories were 17 points behind in the polls and his team were concerned that they were heading to defeat. As the Conservatives tend to do in times of trouble, they called in Lynton Crosby . The campaign, as Tom Bower documents in The Gambler, his biography of Johnson, was quickly changed. Out was the strategy to focus on plans for “Boris Island” – the doomed Thames estuary airport – and new funds for street parties. In was a new sense of discipline by which Johnson would focus on five key issues: police, crime, housing, transport and the economy.  Johnson went on to win. But not everyone was happy with the new direction of travel. His PR chief, Guto Harri – who was appointed No 10 director of communications on Saturday – lamented: “Lynton’s taking the bubbles out of the champagne.” In other words, Johnson was being turned into just another politician. As the prime minister’s latest reset gets under way, MPs are unsure as to which version of Johnson they are being sold: a new, serious one or a return to the joker. There have been plenty of calls for greater discipline and a smoother No 10 operation after “partygate’s” months of chaos. It’s why Johnson’s claim to MPs last week that Crosby would be offering regular strategic advice was met with cheers. But since then the Tory election guru has played down his role and the great reboot has got off to a clunky start. The first full week of the reset has been dominated by a row over his comments on Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile (including protesters mobbing the Labour leader); speculation over the number of no confidence letters that have been submitted; and the faint praise of Johnson’s new press chief, who declared in an interview that his new boss was “not a complete clown”. The appointment of Harri to director of communications and the Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay to chief of staff – with more to follow in the coming days – was meant to reassure MPs and suggest that Johnson was in control after a sling of resignations. But while Johnson succeeded in avoiding an immediate backlash, both have been met with a mixed reaction. Barclay’s appointment is the more popular of the two. He is viewed as a safe pair of hands who will keep MPs connected to No 10 – a crucial task when Johnson is trying to avoid 54 letters of no confidence going in and triggering a vote on his leadership. But there are some ministers who are concerned he could be both ineffective and controlling. He will be balancing one of the trickiest roles in No 10 with ministerial duties and his own constituency work. “He’s a technocrat,” says one senior Tory. “He’s a less efficient Dan [Rosenfield, former Downing Street chief of staff] but hopefully less up his own arse.” As for Harri’s appointment, not everyone is thrilled to see the bubbles back in the champagne. While one cabinet minister praises the fact he has a longstanding relationship with Johnson so will “know how to get the best out of him”, the fact that the press chief kickstarted the job with an interview declaring that the pair “had a little blast” of Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive on his appointment has rung alarm bells. Traditionally advisers should avoid becoming the story. “You couldn’t make it up,” says a member of the 2017 intake. ‘“I presumed it was a parody.” “Before you know it he will be doing the broadcast round on the Today programme,” jokes a former government aide. Another adds “he’s the new Scaramucci”, in reference to Donald Trump’s former press chief who lasted just 10 days. Reports that he lobbied on behalf of Huawei have only added to doubts. Meanwhile, MPs on the right of the party are concerned that Harri’s appointment is at odds with reassurances from Johnson that his government will focus on traditional Tory values after its recent difficulties. “We’re being told he will scrap the woke stuff but he’s just hired someone who took the knee on television,” says one such MP, in reference to Harri’s exit from GB News. But the bigger problem with Johnson’s reboot goes beyond personnel changes. As a general rule, government resets rarely come from a position of strength – rather, they risk highlighting the prime minister’s weakness. Over the past three months, Johnson’s authority has seeped away. He serves in No 10 at the pleasure of his MPs – many of whom he has had to placate with multiple promises. “I give it two months,” says a former minister. “It feels like we are back to a minority government. Boris is governing on MP demands. It’s unsustainable.” Another MP – yet to put a letter in – adds that one of the best things the prime minister has going for him is that his critics believe he is more likely to lose a confidence vote in a few months’ time than now, so some are holding off from submitting. Plans for a mini reshuffle this week, in which the whips’ office will be shaken up, have the potential to backfire. Multiple members of the 2019 intake believe the prime minister has suggested they are on the brink of promotion and are awaiting the call. But such a move would trigger a backlash of its own. Following the appointment of the 2019-er Andrew Griffith – who previously served as Johnson’s business adviser – as policy chief in the wake of Munira Mirza’s resignation, one MP from an older intake warns that any more promotions among the 2019 group will result in “a bloody nose”. Sending any ambitious ministers to the backbenches to make way for others also risks more letters going in. For many MPs, Johnson is on borrowed time. They are acutely aware that this is the second time he has shaken up his team. Briefings that the “grownups” have entered No 10 are all too familiar. It’s the same language that was used when Rosenfield was brought in to replace the Vote Leave regime. If the dysfunction continues, MPs will take it as the final straw: they will conclude that changing the people around Johnson isn’t enough – you have to change the prime minister, too.

2/8/2022,"SSE, the electricity generator and network company, has upgraded its profit forecasts to nearly £1bn for its latest financial year as soaring gas prices more than made up for disappointing renewable energy output. The FTSE 100 company runs gas-fired power plants alongside hydroelectric and windfarms, meaning it can make up for still periods by burning more gas – albeit at the cost of increased carbon dioxide emissions.  That has allowed it to take advantage of the tight global gas market, in which prices have quadrupled, adding to the squeeze on household incomes but providing a huge surge in profits for some of the UK’s biggest energy companies. SSE, which is based in Perth, increased its adjusted profit forecast for the financial year ending on 31 March to “at least 90p” a share, up from 83p, in a trading update published on Tuesday. That would suggest profits (excluding some one-off costs) of at least £950m. It would compare with adjusted profit after tax of £910m for the year to 31 March 2021. Renewable energy output in the UK and Ireland from April to December was only 81% of planned levels, SSE said, because of an “exceptionally still and dry” summer. Meanwhile, energy output of 11.2 gigawatt hours (GWh) from its gas- and oil-fired plants was nearly double total renewables generation of 5.9GWh. Gregor Alexander, the SSE finance director, said he had “renewed confidence about delivery of good financial results for the full year”. He argued that gas-fired plants give the company “balance through a turbulent trading period” as well as the ability to give sustainable shareholder returns over the long term. The company has also committed to reducing its direct emissions by 80% by 2030. The SSE profit upgrade came despite fossil fuel energy output falling by 14% for the period compared with 2020, reflecting the extraordinary gas price increases that have taken centre stage in UK politics during the winter months. SSE’s profit upgrade came on the same day as the oil company BP announced its highest annual profits for eight years at £9.45bn, while its fellow FTSE 100 driller Shell made £14.3bn. The energy company profits have sparked calls for a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, no longer provides energy to retail customers, meaning it has avoided much of the turmoil in that part of the market. British household bills will rise by a record 54% on average from April after the regulator lifted the cap on default tariffs to £1,971. SSE Energy Services, SSE’s former energy arm taken over by Ovo Energy in 2020, faced criticism last month for advising customers to reduce their heatings bills by “having a cuddle with your pets” and “doing a few star jumps”.",News/Business,SSE forecasts profits of nearly £1bn as gas prices soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/sse-forecasts-profits-of-nearly-1bn-as-gas-prices-soar
2/8/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s threats over Ukraine could backfire to damage the Russian economy, the head of the International Energy Agency has warned, as any escalation of the current tension would cause a “seismic” upheaval of the EU energy market that would have “more consequences for Russia” than for Europe. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the global energy watchdog, said that if Russia reduced gas supplies further it would prompt European countries to seek urgently to shift away from Russian gas, which would hurt Putin economically.  “If Russia stops the gas supply to Europe, it could have a seismic impact on European energy. [Russia] has to consider the consequences if existing oil and gas supplies to Europe are halted,” Birol told the Guardian. “Failure to maintain [supplies] would shatter Russia’s reputation as a reliable partner and that would be a tectonic shift. Russia would be seen as a threat and that would have far-reaching consequences for European economies, but even more consequences for Russia. Europe would choose a strategy to diverge from Russia,” he predicted. He said the next two months would be “critical” in deciding how the current energy crisis played out. A mild winter would ease the pressure, but if not then Europe would face stark foreign policy choices on how to deal with Russia, he said. Birol has previously said Putin was exacerbating the gas crisis in Europe for political reasons, as Russian gas supplies to the EU had dropped 25% in recent months despite increasing demand. “I hope this was only a coincidence,” he added. The worst outcomes could still be avoided, he said: “Of course, we do not know what will happen if this political tension goes beyond being tension. I hope there will be dialogue, and that there will be no major geopolitical distortions.” Birol, one of the world’s foremost energy economists, also sharply criticised as “irresponsible” those who have claimed the high energy prices in the UK, Europe and the US should be blamed on the shift to low-carbon power. “Claims that the current volatility is owing to renewable energy are misleading to say the least, and are not based in fact,” he said. “This is not a clean energy crisis, or a renewable energy crisis. These claims are irresponsible and are being used to attack public support for the net zero transition.” He added: “Countries should understand that the current situation is not happening because they have a lot of clean energy policies, but because we do not have enough clean energy policies.” Renewable energy helps to reduce the volatility in energy markets, which was being caused by high gas prices and gas supply issues, he said. The impact of the gas price was at least eight times bigger in raising energy prices than the impact of the price that some countries have put on carbon, he added. People making false claims that the shift to net zero was raising energy prices either did not know the facts, or were deliberately attacking clean energy in service of the vested interests of fossil fuel suppliers, Birol said. He urged governments not to give way to those calling for stronger investment in fossil fuels as the remedy for high prices. “That would be myopic, and against the fundamental economic interests of these countries,” he warned. “The cure would be worse than the disease.” Birol was also optimistic that the resurgence of coal use, particularly in China, would prove to be temporary. “The production increases [in coal] are strong, but mainly driven by post-pandemic demand and high gas prices,” he said. He said the economics of renewable energy were still an attractive investment, accounting for more than 90% of the new power capacity installed last year globally. To reduce the pressure of high gas prices, governments should “accelerate efforts on renewable energy and energy efficiency”, he said. The world did not need large amounts of gas power to make up for the intermittency of renewable energy, as some have claimed, he said, as this could be achieved with more investments in the electricity grid to balance supply and demand, and in battery storage, as well as hydroelectricity, nuclear power and using carbon capture and storage technology with any gas-fired power stations that remained. Hydrogen could also replace gas in some applications, he predicted. Despite the current energy price, Birol said he was “more optimistic” about the world’s chances of tackling the climate crisis and moving to net zero emissions since the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, where governments affirmed their commitments to reach net zero emissions and hold global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, though few yet have detailed plans. “Many governments see the current high energy prices as confirmation of their long-term plans to reduce the share of fossil fuels,” he said. “Of course, high energy prices are taken by some to push back on and reduce public support for the net zero transition. But I think this is a temporary thing. The long-term structural trends are in favour of clean energy options.”",News/World news,"Putin’s Ukraine threats may backfire on Russia, says energy chief",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/putin-ukraine-threats-russia-energy

Reading between the lines he would like to marry her and his father appears to want to get his hands on the blood money due to Mina as compensation. When she refuses, they threaten her with a custody battle over her daughter Bita (Avin Poor Raoufi), who is deaf.  Then along comes Reza (Alireza Sanifar), a depressed sad-looking man who seems too good to be true. He tells Mina that he is an old friend of her husband – he wants to help out, find her somewhere to live. But is all what it seems? Here the film pivots into a kind of subtle thriller, as Mina and Reza become friends, possibly more. This is a suspenseful engrossing watch, though perhaps with a couple too many plot developments.

2/8/2022,"When news of Thich Nhat Hanh’s death spread around the world, I saw far more people than I’d have expected say how he affected them, through a talk, a book, a retreat, an idea, an example. It was a reminder of the huge impact Buddhism has had in the west as a set of ideas that has flowed far beyond the limits of who belongs to a Buddhist group or has a formal practice. You could think of Buddhism in this context as one tributary of a broad new river of ideas flowing through the west, from which many have drunk without knowing quite where the waters came from.  A Vietnamese monk who founded meditation centers on four continents and published dozens of books, Thich Nhat Hanh was one of the great teachers who came from Asia in the 20th century, along with Zen monks from Japan and Tibetan rinpoches. He stood out because he came to the west as an explicitly political figure, arguing against the war in Vietnam (though the Dalai Lama’s opposition to the Chinese occupation of Tibet is certainly political too). His death seemed to me not an ending but a reminder that something far grander than this great teacher began sometime in the last century and continues to spread. We are not who we were very long ago. A lot of new ideas have emerged from Buddhism and other traditions emphasizing kindness and compassion, equality and egalitarianism, nonviolence, critical perspectives on materialism and capitalism, and what I once heard the Zen priest Paul Haller at the San Francisco Zen Center call “the practice of awareness”. They constitute a shift in what we ask of ourselves and others as profound as it is subtle. That subtlety consists of its incremental nature and of its realization as personal beliefs and actions in everyday life – that sometimes add up to more concrete changes in laws and institutions. You have to go back to how widely accepted various forms of cruelty and domination were half a century ago, from corporal punishment in public schools to domestic violence and systemic silencing and exclusion, to recognize how much has changed. A lot of us have had the experience, in recent years, of going back to old novels and films and even songs to find that we no longer overlook or accept their casual cruelty. Of course the new ideas are corruptible, and charismatic leaders, including in Buddhist lineages, have abused their power – but I was amused to find that corporate attempts to co-opt mindfulness sometimes backfire when they make employees less tolerant of harmful policies. This river of new ideas is a confluence of many other tributaries, of feminism, antiracism and ecological ideas, and it has as one of its key principles a vision that everything is connected. Of course not everyone has changed; Bipoc people in the US are far from achieving equality by most measures; and many of these ideas exist more as aspirations than everyday practices. But none of this means the ideas and ideals don’t matter, and the backlash by the right is a backlash against something they see as transformative and threatening. I’ve called contemporary conservative thinking “the ideology of isolation”, obsessed with control through separation and segregation, with borders and anti-immigration rhetoric, with policing racial and gender categories, and marriage inequality both as a denial of marital rights to same-sex couples and of male domination within heterosexual marriage. It’s anti-environmental, because the foundational truth of ecological science is that the world is made of pervasive, interconnecting systems, not discrete objects. With that comes a mandate to act with responsibility toward the consequences that is at odds with the conservative ideals of individual freedom and unfettered capitalism. Hanh died on 22 January. On 25 January, the Save the Redwoods League announced that it had transferred title to a 523-acre stretch of redwood forest to the Intertribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council, a coalition of 10 tribal groups on the north-west coast of California. The place that had been dubbed Andersonia West “will again be known as Tc’ih-Léh-Dûñ (pronounced tsih-ih-LEY-duhn), meaning “Fish Run Place” in the Sinkyone language,” the press release notes. You have to know that the Save the Redwoods League was founded 104 years ago by wealthy white men who were both eugenicists and elitists to understand how vast a transformation has taken place. Most of that transformation has been in the past few decades. I remember reading an academic paper on the scurrilous past of the Save the Redwoods League in the mid-1990s, when the environmental movement tended to ignore or oppose indigenous presence in the lands they sought to conserve and was complacent or oblivious about its own past. The League was co-founded by Madison Grant, who headed the American Eugenics Society, was vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League, and is notorious for the pseudoscientific book The Passing of the Great Race. The other founders held similar views. The law professor Joyce Alene tweeted a few weeks ago, on Martin Luther King Day: “The moral arc of the universe is not going to bend itself.” People – famous, powerful, unknown, humble – bend it, often in increments or ways too small or subtle to measure. They add up. In the 1990s I watched the environmental movement slowly shift from its fantasies of “virgin wilderness” to the recognition that nearly every place on Earth was or is indigenous homeland and therefore environmental protection and human rights were not separate concerns (and that access to nature and to clean air and water were also racial-justice issues). The ideas that fed the shift came from indigenous struggles and indigenous intellectuals and allied scholars and activists. Those struggles are far from over, but the premises with which many of us operate are far different than they were. These usually begin as changes in consciousness and new narratives. They end as changes in law, policy, everyday practices and stuff as tangible as land ownership. This year, that includes an old-growth forest under indigenous management, with trees more than eight feet in diameter that “tower among Douglas fir, tan oaks, and Pacific madrones over a vibrant understory of huckleberry, manzanita, and ceanothus”.
