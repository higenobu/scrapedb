2/2/2022,"Boris Johnson faces a backlash from Conservative MPs after allies briefed the prime minister had won over his party, as splits appear in the One Nation group of Tory centrists about how to proceed. On Tuesday, the veteran MP Peter Aldous said he had submitted a letter of no confidence and MP Tom Hunt criticised the “cack-handed” backers of the prime minister, though stopped short of saying he should resign. Gary Streeter, the MP for South West Devon, also declined to say he had confidence in the prime minister.  It is understood Johnson saw at least four former ministers late on Monday night after at least three others told him their support was either lost or conditional on Sue Gray’s final report in Downing Street’s lockdown breaches, now being investigated by police. Aldous became the latest MP to say he had written a letter of no confidence in Johnson. “After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the Prime Minister should resign,” Aldous tweeted. “I have never taken such action before and had hoped that I would not be put in such an invidious position. Whilst I am conscious that others will disagree with me, I believe that this is in the best interests of the country, the Government and the Conservative Party.” Elliot Colburn, MP for Carshalton and Wallington, also revealed to a constituent that his “patience has now snapped” with Boris Johnson and the partygate scandal in a hint that he could be among those to have put in a letter. “If I were the PM, I’d be considering my position,” he said. Gary Streeter, the MP for South West Devon, said it was not true the prime minister’s meeting with MPs was “well received” on Monday evening. “This one is not over yet,” he told BBC Radio Devon. “It has got legs. A lot of us are thinking very seriously about what we should do about it. “It’s a serious matter of course to express no confidence in a prime minister … I’m reflecting and certainly over the next couple days will make a decision.” Johnson’s critics admitted there was “no plan and no coordination” among those who believed the prime minister should go. One senior MP who has been publicly critical of Johnson said they had been aghast at colleagues’ response to the prime minister’s private meeting with his MPs on Monday night. “The Tory party’s reputation for ruthlessness is a complete lie, it’s actually never been true and we’re seeing it happening before our eyes,” the MP said. One former minister who said they were among a number of colleagues prepared to move as a collective after the Sue Gray report, described it as a “deeply unwelcome delay” but said they still held the view that a no confidence vote would have a greater chance of success once the full evidence had been disclosed. But another former cabinet minister, who has seen Johnson, said that a leadership contest “is filling people with horror” about the damage that in itself could do to the party. “We would be on to our fourth prime minister. What does that say about the party? For better or worse, we did throw our lot in with him and we won a big majority.” But the MP said that would change if Johnson was fined by the Met. “He’s not out of the woods, no. He’d be very foolish to have a Mission Accomplished banner. At the point where he has committed a criminal offence, of course that changes things. And it depends how bad is the final Gray report.” Among those who have expressed anger and frustration are some of the more critical 2019 MPs who have privately told more experienced colleagues they feel betrayed. Hunt has said the limited findings made in Gray’s update were not “acceptable, excusable, or defensible” but stopped short of saying it meant he had submitted a letter of no confidence. The MP for Ipswich said some of the interventions by Boris Johnson’s allies had been “so cack-handed that the best way they could be of assistance to the Prime Minister would be to disable all their social media platforms and cease carrying out media interviews”. “Silence would be preferable,” he said. He said it was not the time to “depose the Prime Minister”, but that a line could not be drawn under the saga until the full report was published.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson faces backlash from angry Tory MPs over parties scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/boris-johnson-faces-backlash-from-angry-tory-mps-over-parties-scandal
2/2/2022,"Ministers face a backlash from climate groups after giving the green light to a new North Sea oil field just weeks after the Cop26 UN climate talks in Glasgow. The Abigail oil and gas field off the east coast of Scotland was quietly approved by the government’s Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) last month, defying climate experts who warned at the Glasgow conference in November that no new fossil fuel developments would be compatible with the world’s climate targets.  Climate campaigners object to the field, which will be developed by Israeli owned Ithaca Energy, because its diminutive gas reserves will do little to help secure the UK’s energy supplies while contributing to carbon emissions. Tessa Khan, the director of Uplift, a group which campaigns for a fossil-free UK, said the field would “see little to no benefit for UK energy customers or taxpayers, which only worsens the climate crisis, and where the only winners are the oil firm behind the project”. Khan said the government should instead cut the UK’s reliance on “very expensive, highly polluting energy” in favour of a “serious response” to both unaffordable energy bills and the climate crisis based on renewable energy. “The government needs to stop rolling over for the oil and gas industry, stop dishing out licences, and get on with making sure people have access to affordable, renewable energy,” she said. An OGA spokesperson said; “The OGA will continuously hold the operator to account on emissions reductions as part of our stewardship.” The government has also faced opposition for failing to insist that a major new oil development at Cambo in the North Sea comply with incoming legislation which would apply a “climate compatibility checkpoint” for new fossil fuel projects. Work at the Cambo field was halted late last year by private equity-backed fossil fuel explorer Siccar Point Energy, after its project partner Shell pulled out of the project following fierce opposition from environmental activists. Caroline Rance, a climate and energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth Scotland, described the government’s climate checklist as a “farcical plan” which was “designed to set the bar so low that the oil industry gets to lock us into their climate-wrecking business as usual for decades to come”. “The UK government should immediately stop granting permission for new oil and gas projects, and instead begin a managed phase-out of existing fields while ensuring a just transition for affected workers and communities,” she said. “The simple fact is that there is no such thing as a climate compatible oil and gas development. Climate science is crystal clear that burning fossil fuels is the key driver of the climate crisis and that there can be no new oil and gas fields anywhere in the world if we’re to limit warming to the 1.5C limit,” Rance added.",News/Environment,North Sea Abigail oil field plan approved despite climate goals,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/01/north-sea-abigail-oil-field-plan-approved-despite-climate-goals
2/2/2022,"Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of ignoring Russia’s security proposals in his first public comments on the growing crisis over Ukraine since December. During a press conference at the Kremlin, Putin told journalists he was unsatisfied with the US response to Russian demands that Nato remove troops and infrastructure from eastern Europe and pledge never to accept Ukraine into the alliance.  “It’s already clear … that Russia’s principal concerns were ignored,” Putin said following talks with the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Putin said he was ready to continue negotiations with the west, which has said it is ready for dialogue but views Moscow’s demands as a non-starter. But Russia has also continued deploying thousands of troops and offensive weapons to the Ukrainian border, appearing to threaten a strike if the Kremlin does not get its way. Putin’s remarks broke almost a month of silence on the issue from the Russian leader, who has been mostly absent from public life as concern has grown in western capitals that Moscow was preparing an invasion. His next move remains unpredictable. Joe Biden has said that he believes Putin has not decided whether or not to launch an attack but that he expects that he will “move in”. In emotional remarks, Putin also said the west was using Ukraine a “tool to hinder Russia” and hypothesised that Ukraine’s entrance into Nato could lead to a conflict over Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. The Russian leader imagined a situation where Ukraine joined Nato and then sought to retake Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. “That’s sovereign Russian territory,” Putin said. “So now we have to start a war against the Nato alliance?” “Did anyone think about this?” he asked hypothetically. “I don’t think so.” He rejected US arguments that every country has the right to choose their own alliances, saying that one state must not be allowed to increase its security to the detriment of another state, namely Russia. On Tuesday evening, Putin said that the United States had not given “adequate consideration” of Russia’s “three key demands,” including a halt to Nato expansion, a refusal to place missile systems on Russia’s borders and remove Nato troops and infrastructure from central and east European countries that joined the alliance after 1997. Russia is now expected to deliver a formal response to the United States in the coming weeks. During a telephone call on Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that the US was ready for a “substantive exchange with Russia on mutual security concerns” but demanded an “immediate Russian de-escalation and the withdrawal of troops and equipment from Ukraine’s borders”. “He emphasised that further invasion of Ukraine would be met with swift and severe consequences and urged Russia to pursue a diplomatic path,” a state department readout of the conversation said.",News/World news,Ukraine crisis: Putin accuses US of ignoring Russian security concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/ukraine-crisis-putin-accuses-us-of-ignoring-russian-security-concerns
2/2/2022,"Days of protests against pandemic policies and a deep rift within Canada’s conservative movement have highlighted the growing power of rightwing populist movements in the country. On Tuesday, retail stores and vaccine clinics in Ottawa remained closed as protesters, who had travelled to the nation’s capital under the guise of protesting vaccine mandates for truckers, refused to leave.  “There’s a million people that live in Ottawa. I hear you. I hear the protesters, the province hears the protesters, the country hears the protesters,” said the Ontario premier, Doug Ford. “Now it’s time to let the people in Ottawa get back to their lives.” Ford, a conservative politician who rose to power on a successful populist campaign, had previously said the protestors – some of whom defaced statues, carried swastika flags and harassed soup kitchen employees – had “no place” in Ontario or Canada. But as Ford condemned the protest movement, Canada’s federal Conservative leader faced the prospect that he might be ousted amid growing discontent in his party. Erin O’Toole has encountered repeated criticism not only for losing an election to Justin Trudeau, but over how he’s handled a number of issues in recent months. O’Toole was one of the last Conservatives to publicly announce he would meet with protesters. By then, a number of prominent Conservatives had touted the patriotism of the movement, even has concern grew that a number of far-right groups had attached themselves to the convoy. “Canada needs us to be united and serious,” O’Toole said on Facebook. “It’s time for a reckoning. To settle this in caucus. Right here. Right now. Once and for all.” But the precariousness of O’Toole’s tenure as leader, and the speed with which his colleagues embraced the protesters, speaks to a possible shift in the country’s political landscape. “Any politician looking at this right now sees two things: this group raised a ton of money in a very short period of time. And more importantly, these people are excited,” said Stephanie Carvin, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University and former national security analyst for the federal government. “They’re enthusiastic to be out there doing what they think is democracy, even if those ideas are unconstitutional, unworkable, unrealistic and a tremendous public health hazard. But they’re putting something out there that’s different – and that’s appealing to people.” Recent polling found most voters were largely apathetic to party offerings in the most recent election. Carvin compared Canada’s growing populist movement to Tea Party politics in the United States, which in the late 2000s harnessed populist energy around issues of taxation and limited government to dramatically alter the landscape of Congress. While most of the truckers and supporters have departed the city, Ottawa police say the protests could last until next weekend – a reality that has frustrated residents. “I’m calling for the full resumption of our services (library, vaccine clinics, schools) and support of residents who should not be subjected to hatred, intimidation and constant debilitating noise in our city,” tweeted Shawn Menard, Ottawa city councillor. A similar protest has paralyzed an Alberta border town for days, after dozens of trucks blocked access to the highway in protest of public health policies. The mayor of Coutts, a border town, says he wants the truckers gone, as mail can’t be delivered and some buses have been unable to take students to school. The Royal Canadian Mounted police in Alberta say the protest is no longer lawful, and plan to begin making arrests and towing away vehicles. After a series of Indigenous-led blockades in 2019, Alberta’s conservative government passed a law last year that allows for additional penalties against protesters blockading highways and other infrastructure. Carvin sees both protests as animating a segment of the population frustrated with the pandemic. While the Westminster system is less vulnerable to political extremism than the US system, it is not fully immune, she said. “We definitely are seeing a populist movement Canada. But it’s still an open question whether it can reframe itself after the pandemic ends,” said Carvin. “It’s tapping into the frustration a lot of people feel right now about the pandemic. But what happens when the pandemic ends? Can a political party or leader capture that enthusiasm and excitement we’re seeing, or will it just dissipate?”",News/World news,Canada’s Covid protests highlight rise of rightwing populist movements,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/canada-protests-covid-vaccines-mandates-rightwing-movement
2/2/2022,"Sue Gray’s update omitted any reference to the ministerial code, despite its inclusion in her terms of reference. While the Metropolitan police investigation may have precluded consideration of alleged criminal behaviour, it should not have prevented further examination of her finding of “failures of leadership and judgment” and “a failure to observe ... the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government”, in relation to the prime minister himself. Her reluctance to enter this minefield may well be due to the requirement in the code that “ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the prime minister”. Clearly this is unworkable and is not addressed by Boris Johnson’s proposals for reform, which conveniently refer only to codes of conduct for civil servants and advisers (Johnson creates Office of the Prime Minister after Sue Gray criticism, 31 January).  However, there is an even deeper problem. Johnson inhabits a parallel linguistic universe where phrases such as “I take full responsibility” do not have their usual meaning. Gray’s report could never have established wilful mendacity, a meaningless concept for a fantasist who cannot distinguish truth from fiction. Only Tory MPs have the power to bring this farce to a conclusion. Any of them with a shred of decency left should act to do so now.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondon  John Crace (Sketch, 31 January) quite rightly identifies the anomaly at the heart of our constitutional crisis, namely that we are labouring under a dysfunctional parliamentary system in which Ian Blackford is removed from the Commons for stating the truth that Boris Johnson has lied and misled the house, while the prime minister is allowed to remain and continue lying. That dishonesty cannot be called out, nor the dishonest held to account, would not be acceptable under any decent written constitution. The time is long overdue for a resurrection of the aims of Charter 88 in “drawing up a written constitution anchored in the ideal of universal citizenship”, under which no one should be censored for speaking truth to power any more than those in power should be able to promote untruths. Perhaps a Charter 22 could make the case for such reforms. And certainly, the recruitment of large numbers of signatories to such a charter would be easy in the age of social media.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire  Never has the contrast between Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson been thrown into sharper relief than during the former’s magnificent speech in the Commons on Monday. One man radiated decency and demonstrated true respect for the sacrifices and losses the British people have endured these last two years. The other shied yet again from accepting personal responsibility, and for good measure sought to tar his opponent with the name of a paedophile.

2/2/2022,"Instead of counting empty beds (Millions wasted on empty secure children’s home beds in England and Wales, says Labour, 27 January), we need to be counting children and asking ourselves why we are depriving so many of our vulnerable young people of their liberty in the first place. While the number of children held in custody has indeed declined over the past decade, the numbers being held for their own welfare have been rising. A growing body of evidence shows that these two groups are largely the same children. We know that up to half of children in custody have been in care at some point in their lives. Children placed in secure settings – whether through youth custody or because of risks to their safety – have had similar experiences of trauma and disadvantage from early childhood and therefore have similar needs.  Hidden in these figures are the most vulnerable children of all who, in dramatically rising numbers, cannot be found a place in a secure children’s home because of a lack of available beds or because they are deemed too “challenging”. These children simply disappear from view. They don’t appear in published data. We don’t know how many there are, or where they are placed. We need to rethink how we improve the lives of the most vulnerable children in our society and be clear about the purpose of depriving young people of their liberty – is it care or incarceration?Lisa HarkerDirector, Nuffield Family Justice Observatory  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/2/2022,"Three critical issues surrounding the future of the Sizewell C project were missing from the recent announcement (Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station, 27 January). The first is the appalling state of EDF’s finances. This is coupled with shutdowns at its French power stations, using similar technology to Sizewell C. Newer nuclear power stations are not working. The second is that China General Nuclear Power has a 20% stake in Sizewell C. How does the government intend to play its cards here? How much will it pay to ask CGNP to stand down? £100m?  The third is that the £100m represents just 0.5% of the total build. It will not be enough to attract any sizeable pension funds. As a consequence, our energy bills would need to go up to provide the £20bn-plus of funding. My estimate is that this would put, over a 25-year period, about £330 a year on our energy bills.

2/2/2022,"Colin the Caterpillar has shaken hands with rival Cuthbert in a resolution of the supermarket cake wars. Marks & Spencer has reached a deal with Aldi after taking legal action to protect its bestselling bug-shaped Colin cake. M&S had called in the lawyers over concerns that the German discount grocer’s rival chocolate sponge roll, Cuthbert, was making copycat appearances at birthday parties and picnics.  Details of the deal, which was finalised in the high court last week, have not been revealed, but it is understood that Cuthbert will not appear again in quite the same form. Marks & Spencer, which launched the legal action against Aldi almost a year ago, said: “The objective of the claim was to protect the [intellectual property] in our Colin the Caterpillar cake and we are very pleased with the outcome.” Aldi, which is in another legal spat with M&S over a light-up Christmas gin, has indicated that Cuthbert, who was featured as a soft toy in its stores over Christmas and as a cake last spring, will be back, however. The discounter said in a tweet labelled #freecuthbert: “Getting out early on good behaviour, keep an eye out for Cuthy B this Spring.” An Aldi spokesperson added: “Cuthbert is free and looking forward to seeing all his fans again very soon!” Colin the caterpillar, whose name has risen to prominence on social media in recent weeks as a potential attender at Downing Street’s lockdown birthday events, made his debut in 1990. M&S has three trademarks relating to its caterpillar cake, including the words “Colin the Caterpillar” and the packaging. With more than 15m cake sales under his belt he is one of M&S’s key food brands alongside Percy Pig. He is also known for his philanthropy, thanks to a tie-up with the cancer charity Macmillan. His fame has led to a number of brand extensions, including his girlfriend (cake) Connie. But popularity has also led to many similar larval-based confections popping up in rival retailers.

2/2/2022,"My husband, Bob Casey, who has died of sepsis aged 65, was a youth worker who spent most of his life working with disadvantaged young people in inner city and rural areas of Britain. The eldest of three children of Enid (nee Bradshaw), a ward clerk at the Royal Preston hospital, and Jim Casey, a messenger for what is now NatWest Bank, Bob was born and grew up in Preston, Lancashire. He served an apprenticeship at British Aerospace and worked there as an engineer before leaving in the early 1980s to test his vocation to the priesthood at Ushaw College, Durham. Following five years in the seminary, he left before ordination to train instead as a youth and community worker in London.  Bob was committed to youth work and had great drive, with a talent for engaging difficult-to-reach young people. He worked with challenging behaviour in a manner that meant young people were not excluded from activities and he encouraged the teams he managed to do likewise. He excelled at building-based work and ran well-attended, vibrant youth clubs in deprived areas of London, Newcastle, Lancaster and Preston. He was able to adapt his skills to many other settings and in the mid-1990s he set up and ran a pupil referral unit with Gabrielle Cox and Irvine Williams at the Hideaway Youth Project in Moss Side, Manchester, providing education to young people who had been excluded from school. In the early 2000s he managed the Single Regeneration Budget in north Lancaster, where he was instrumental in transforming a disused building on Ryelands Park into a youth centre. During this time, he worked with Helen Clugston at the Dukes theatre, Lancaster, supporting her Shattering Images theatre group for young people with disabilities. Bob and I met in 1992 when we were both working at the St John Boste Youth Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne. We were married in Colombia in 2008. For the past decade we had lived in Cambridgeshire, from where Bob facilitated the West Norfolk Youth Advisory Board, enabling young people to influence youth provision through representation to their local authority. Beyond youth work, Bob and I provided foster care for a number of children in Cambridgeshire. He undertook several charity bike rides, including by tandem from John O’Groats to Land’s End with his brother Jimmy. He enjoyed walking and completed the Pennine Way with his brother John. He also adored our rescue greyhounds, Hector and Tallulah. Bob was known for his keen sense of humour, generosity of spirit and courage to speak truth. Recently a colleague remarked that Bob had helped so many to find their smile.

2/2/2022,"The Italian League leader, Matteo Salvini, has proposed creating a rightwing political force styled on America’s Republican party in a move that threatens to spell the end of his tense partnership with his sometime far-right rival Giorgia Meloni. Salvini’s League and other parties including the centre-left Democratic party and populist Five Star Movement that make up Italy’s broad ruling coalition have been left in disarray after failing to agree on a mutually acceptable candidate for head of state in last week’s presidential election, culminating with Sergio Mattarella, 80, being elected for a second term against his earlier expressed wishes.  His call was made in Il Giornale, the Silvio Berlusconi-owned newspaper, as he scrambles for survival under pressure from those within his own ranks over the presidential election debacle. He wrote that the rightwing parties that support Mario Draghi’s government could create a force modelled “on that of the American Republican party” and will reportedly meet Berlusconi, the Forza Italia leader, to discuss the proposal. Salvini’s ultimate endorsement of Mattarella for president infuriated Meloni, the leader of Brothers of Italy, which allies with the League and Forza Italia in elections but unlike them stayed out of Draghi’s government. She accused them of “betrayal” for their behind-the-scenes dealings with their coalition partners. Her party has steadily grown to overtake the League in opinion polls since the formation of Draghi’s government a year ago. Italian media described Salvini’s proposal as signalling a potential “divorce” with Brothers of Italy. Salvini and Meloni have in the past put on a united front, but the latter’s growing influence has intensified competition between the pair for leadership within the rightwing alliance as they eye general elections in spring 2023. Meloni said the rightwing bloc needed to be “refounded” while at the same time suggesting it would be “better to go it alone than in bad company”. Brothers of Italy currently polls as the second biggest party in Italy, behind the centre-left Democratic party. “Salvini is afraid of Meloni,” said Roberto D’Alimonte, a political science professor at Luiss University in Rome. “But the real issue is technical and goes back to the electoral system – under the present system, Meloni and Salvini would have to run together.” The government is expected to hold a debate about Italy’s electoral system later this year, which could result in it reverting back to proportional representation, eliminating the necessity at present for coalitions to be formed before the vote. D’Alimonte said that Salvini is “scrambling to find a way out of a corner” but that he didn’t expect Brothers of Italy to gain much higher than its current 20.5% rating in the polls. Unless the political system changes, they will most likely stick together, he suggested. “They are trying to divorce but divorce is not guaranteed.” In his call for a new rightwing grouping, Salvini posited “a political space where we find hospitality for the various souls who have sensibilities of an alternative culture to leftwing progressivism”. Mattia Diletti, a political professor at Rome’s Sapienza University, doesn’t expect Salvini’s proposal to come to fruition, adding that the rightwing alliance will probably patch up their differences. “We know from the past that in the end they always find an agreement, as they know they need each other when it’s time to collect votes,” he added. “In the meantime, Meloni can gain as she’s the only clear opposition to the government. But this 20% or so is nothing if she doesn’t have an alliance with the League.”",News/World news,Italian League’s Matteo Salvini calls for new alliance based on US Republicans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/italian-leagues-matteo-salvini-calls-for-new-alliance-based-on-us-republicans

2/2/2022,"Graham Nash has joined his former bandmate Neil Young in taking his music off Spotify, in protest over the Covid misinformation disseminated by the streaming company’s star podcaster, Joe Rogan. The Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young singer and guitarist, who also co-founded 1960s pop group the Hollies, said in a statement:  Having heard the Covid disinformation spread by Joe Rogan on Spotify, I completely agree with and support my friend Neil Young and I am requesting that my solo recordings be removed from the service. There is a difference between being open to varying viewpoints on a matter and knowingly spreading false information which some 270 medical professionals have derided as not only false but dangerous … The opinions publicised by Rogan are so dishonest and unsupported by solid facts that Spotify becomes an enabler in a way that costs people their lives. Last week, Young requested his music be removed from Spotify, arguing that the platform had allowed Rogan – who was signed by Spotify in 2020 to make podcasts in a deal reportedly worth more than $100m – to advance “fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them”. He later added to his criticism, accusing Spotify of “selling lies for money”. A Spotify spokesperson said: “We regret Neil’s decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon”. In April 2021, Rogan said: “If you’re like 21 years old, and you say to me, should I get vaccinated? I’ll go, no”, but when challenged, said “I believe [vaccines] are safe and encourage many people to take them”. In January, he claimed the risk of teenagers getting myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) from the vaccine outweighed the risk of getting Covid, a view challenged by a podcast guest and other researchers. He has wrongly argued vaccines use “gene therapy”, and promoted the use of anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which has not been proven to be effective against Covid-19. He also hosted virologist Robert Malone, who promoted conspiracy theories including that leaders had hypnotised the public into taking the vaccine. The Malone appearance was cited in an open letter from 270 US healthcare leaders criticising Rogan’s podcast. Rogan apologised to Spotify in the wake of Young’s protest and said he bore the singer no ill will. He said he would “try harder to get people with differing opinions on” and “do my best to make sure I’ve researched these topics”. Another successful musician, four-time Grammy winning soul singer India.Arie, has joined Young’s protest this week, writing on Instagram: I have decided to pull my music and podcast from Spotify. Neil Young opened a door that I must walk through. I believe in freedom of speech. However, I find Joe Rogan problematic for reasons other than his Covid interviews… For me it’s also his language around race. What I am talking about is respect – who gets it and who doesn’t. Paying musicians a fraction of a penny? And him $100m? This shows the type of company they are and the company that they keep. I’m tired. In a conversation in January with writer and lecturer Jordan Peterson, discussing the ethnicity of Black US academic Michael Eric Dyson, Rogan said: “Unless you are talking to someone who is like 100% African from the darkest place where they are not wearing any clothes all day ... the term Black is weird.” Rogan and Spotify have not responded to Nash and India.Arie’s criticism. Joni Mitchell and Bruce Springsteen guitarist Nils Lofgren also voiced support for Young in recent days and announced that their music will be removed, though both theirs, Nash’s and India.Arie’s music remain on Spotify for now. Spotify has responded to the furore by appending resources with correct Covid-19 information to podcasts on the subject. Its stock market price, which had fallen slightly after Young’s decision, has rallied this week.",Arts/Music,"Graham Nash removes music from Spotify, calling company ‘enabler that costs lives’",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/01/graham-nash-removes-music-from-spotify-calling-company-enabler-that-costs-lives
2/2/2022,"A man convicted of murdering his fiancee, who is now accused of murdering his wife six years earlier, told a jury his marriage was “perfect” and that he tried to resuscitate his spouse after finding her collapsed in their garden. Ian Stewart, 61, who in 2016 was convicted of murdering Helen Bailey, author of the Electra Brown series of children’s books, denies killing his wife, Diane Stewart, 47, at their home in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, in 2010.  His wife’s cause of death was recorded in 2010 as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (Sudep), but police opened an investigation after a jury found Stewart guilty in 2017 of murdering Bailey. Giving evidence at Huntingdon crown court, Stewart recalled that he had found his wife’s body crumpled in the garden after he returned from a shopping trip to Tesco that was aborted because he had forgotten his wallet. As his two sons listened from the public gallery, he said: “The first thing I did was try to get her in the recovery position. That was hard, I couldn’t get her legs out from under her.” He said he tried to clear her mouth, and then “put her on her back to put her in the position for CPR” and then did “30 compressions and then mouth to mouth”. He had no idea how long he performed CPR, he said. “At the end I was exhausted.” A doctor and nurse lived opposite, the court heard. “I didn’t ring 999, I went over to them to try to get help,” said Stewart, who told the court there was no answer at his neighbours’ door so he returned to his wife to try CPR again, believing she was still alive because of “froth” around her mouth. He said he did not know how long he continued CPR before calling 999, telling operators his wife had “had a fit”. Stewart told jurors he “never, ever saw Diane fit”, but she did have epilepsy. Asked by Amjad Malik QC, defending, if he was “trying to help Diane”, Stewart replied: “I was trying to save her life, obviously trying to get her to breathe again.” Asked to describe his feelings towards his wife in June 2010, Stewart said: “We were in love, very happy, very much so. It was, just looking back, too perfect really, too good.” Stewart went on: “I don’t think we ever had a big fallout, ever.” The jury has previously heard that tests on his wife’s brain tissue, donated for medical research, showed that her “breathing had been restricted”. Earlier, the court heard that Stewart received a total of £96,607.37 following the death of his wife, from her bank accounts – including£28,500.21 from a life insurance policy. Asked by his lawyer if he wanted the money, Stewart said: “No, I don’t want that money, I didn’t need that money, it was for the boys’ futures.” Questioned about a red two-seater MG car he bought after his wife’s death, he said he bought it as “it’s what Diane and I had up until [their son] Jamie was born”. “This was the red one we always wanted, it was just a memory,” he added. Malik asked him: “The prosecution say you caused Diane Stewart to die and that you carried out an action, asphyxiation, upon her. What do you say to that?” Stewart replied: “Total rubbish. I was trying to save her life that day, the exact opposite of what they say happened.” The trial continues.",News/UK news,Convicted murderer accused of killing wife tells court he had ‘perfect’ marriage,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/convicted-murderer-accused-of-killing-wife-tells-court-he-had-perfect-marriage
