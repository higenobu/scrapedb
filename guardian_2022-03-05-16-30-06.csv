3/5/2022,"Households in Great Britain hoping to fix their gas and electricity bills in a desperate attempt to avoid the worst of the price rises are facing quotes as high as £3,500 a year – with the exception of E.ON customers. In the face of market turmoil and soaring wholesale gas prices, most of the UK’s domestic energy suppliers have either stopped offering customers the chance to move to a fixed-price tariff or have priced them at £3,000 and above. Scottish Power’s Fixed Price May 2023 M2 tariff now costs an astonishing £3,500 a year for average use – compared with the current cap of £1,277 a year. A host of other suppliers are quoting at least £3,000 a year to customers looking to fix. British Gas said this week it had pulled its fixed-price tariffs, adding it would not be fair to offer customers “fixed prices based on this price volatility right now”. However, there is one ray of hope, provided you are an existing E.ON customer. On Monday the supplier pulled the last remaining fixed-price tariff to compete with the variable rates on offer after it was highlighted by the MoneySavingExpert founder, Martin Lewis, and swiftly sold out. However, E.ON is still offering existing customers a one-year fixed tariff – Fix 1 Year v 12 – which costs £2,270 a year for average consumption. This is £299 more than the new price cap, which comes in on 1 April, but considerably less than tariffs available on the open market. It is probably a good bet if you qualify, not least as there are no exit fees to pay, meaning customers can leave in the unlikely event that prices start falling again. It is also unlikely to be around for long. Customers new to E.ON would have to pay £3,158 for a one-year fix. Octopus Energy has a similar but slightly less attractive deal. While its standard one-year fix costs £3,200 for average use, it also has a Loyal Octopus fixed tariff, which is 20% cheaper – £2,560 a year. It is only available for those customers who have been with the firm for at least eight months, which rules out anyone who was switched to it when their supplier collapsed last autumn. For the rest of us, it is going to be a difficult year energy-wise. About 22 million households are on tariffs capped by the regulator, Ofgem, meaning direct debit customers will typically be paying just under £2,000 a year from 1 April, and then as much as 50% more from October and through next winter. This week analysts at Cornwall Insight said they expected the average dual-fuel bill to rise to £2,900 a year when the cap changes again in October. Others have warned that households could be paying £3,000 a year next winter. On Wednesday the war in Ukraine sent UK wholesale gas prices – the price paid by energy companies – as high as £4.50 a therm, up from £2.50 a day before. It then settled at about £4. A year ago, suppliers were paying about 35p a therm. The comparison website Energy Helpline, said: “As we expect energy prices to continue to climb over the coming months, a deal which on the face of it may seem like poor value today could actually be worth switching to when you factor in potential future price rises.” Joe Malinowski of the comparison site the Energy Shop said: “If wholesale gas prices double from here again, then £3,000 deals start to make sense but these tariffs are already pricing in a lot of future risk. “Depending upon how the situation (in Ukraine) unfolds, gas prices could literally go anywhere. The best we can hope for is that wholesale gas prices don’t go up much more. All other scenarios are varying degrees of bad.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Energy bills: British consumers quoted up to £3,500 a year for fixed rates",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/05/fixed-rate-energy-deals-households-in-great-britain-quoted-up-to-3500-a-year
3/5/2022,"Oh, to be a bored youth again, with a carefree afternoon stretching ahead like a long, satisfying yawn. It’s not that I want to regress, it’s just … where did all the time go? If clawing a modicum of time for yourself – whether to read, noodle around on GarageBand or simply flop about like a teenager – feels impossible, it’s time to take action. When you’re overloaded with work/parenting/caring/domestic admin/stuff to faff around with on your phone, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that every second is accounted for. But recently, I have finally acknowledged the (slightly embarrassingly obvious) fact that life’s to-do list will never be complete; that spending time doing whatever you want will help you get everything else done; that it’s not selfish, but actually practical. And it has been a gamechanger. This isn’t about aspiring to be a CEO type, who rises at 4am to restore their inbox to zero and get a bouffant blow-dry. It’s about taking 20 minutes to reclaim your humanity. The key for me was not aiming too high. I started setting aside 20 minutes each morning. (Why? I’m better in the morning and it seemed like an achievable length of time.) We may not even need to get up earlier – it could be a case of negotiating with ourselves, partners, housemates or children (hey, there are always audiobooks and cartoons) that we retreat for 20 minutes at an agreed daily time. Brad Aeon, an assistant professor specialising in the science and philosophy of time at the University of Quebec, starts his days doing “pretty much nothing”. He might look out the window, walk around his apartment, drink some water. “I just take my time, and it is very, very rewarding,” he says. It would be less practical to do this once the day has begun in earnest, and the morning is a good time to insulate yourself against stress. “When you wake up, your cortisol levels are super high,” he says. “I don’t need any additional stress in my life, so I want to take it easy.” Author Adrienne Herbert manages to set aside a full hour every morning for herself and loves it so much she wrote a book about it called Power Hour. She says there’s no one-size-fits-all rule – there may be occasions or seasons when later in the day might suit someone better. The morning was the only time she could find solitude before her toddler woke up. “It was the only time when nobody needed me. Nobody was calling or emailing me.” She had more energy in the mornings, too. “By the end of the day,” she says, “you’ve probably spent all your resources on your work, your kids, all the other things that you needed to do. And then it’s like, oh great, you’ve got like 3% left of yourself.” Don’t feel bad about briefly stepping away from work, parenting or caring, says Thomas Moore, the octogenarian psychotherapist and author of 30 books, including the bestselling Care of the Soul. “People have to see that taking a break is part of their work. You can’t do your work unless you can get away from it, so that you have the energy and your brain is clear.” We’re not machines, so do we really need to justify our existence with work, asks Moore. “Work is not the only thing that we do in life – taking a break gives us our humanity.” Ditto for taking time alone. “If you don’t do that, you lose touch with yourself.” None of this will happen unless you’re very deliberate about it. In the UK, by law, anyone working six hours or more has the right to down tools for 20 minutes. But as a break in a working day, that’s hardly self-indulgent; it’s possibly even a little mean. So carving 20 minutes for yourself outside working hours – and not just to wolf down a quick bite in order to dash back to the coalface – is hardly greedy. If you don’t schedule those 20 minutes, says Herbert, “it will take effort and willpower to try to make it happen, and finding that time will become a hassle.” To make it work, you’ll need to schedule your entire day. “Do not wait until the alarm goes off to decide what to do,” she continues. “Making a decision like that first thing in the morning is not good.” Prepare what you’ll need the night before (if Herbert is going for a run, she’ll make sure her outfut is laid out, headphones fully charged) to “reduce the friction”, she says. “I’ll let you into a secret,” says Aeon. “From a cognitive perspective, we think about time in terms of space.” Call me outside business hours, or this meeting was short, or it’s been a long time. This is true, he says, in every language, so “our most intuitive way to manage our time is to visualise it. And a schedule is a visual representation of how much time you have every day of the week. Just looking at it forces you to be realistic, because you can’t fit a three-hour project into a one-hour block.” Aeon advises taking five minutes to ask yourself why you struggle to make time for yourself. “Is it because I don’t set healthy boundaries?” he suggests, “and so I’m always trying to help my significant other, children, colleagues, friends? Is it because I have this fear of being alone with my thoughts?” This is a common barrier. “Spending 20 minutes without necessarily doing anything is torture for a lot of people,” says Aeon, “because their mind goes into these dark places. So constant activity is a way for them to pacify the mind.” Our mental health affects the way we use our time, with research showing, he says, “that taking care of your mental health can improve your time management, and taking care of your time management can improve your mental health – it’s a two-way street”. Herbert started getting up an hour earlier six years ago, when she had a small child and no time to herself, and has turned coaching others to reap its myriad benefits into a career. “I think it’s quite radical,” she says, “for people to accept that you can choose to say, ‘it’s really important for me to start my day taking time for myself – I’m going to prioritise this.’ It’s not selfish. It’s necessary.” Herbert sees the well-worn wellness cliche of “me time” as genuinely empowering. Prioritise your needs, “whether it’s a run, white space or sitting down with a blank sheet of paper to write down your ideas and be creative”. To fit in time for ourselves, Aeon recommends being stricter with how we guard our time. A sense of time poverty can be brought on by what he calls a fundamental bias in how we perceive time. “We always think there’s going to be more time in the future, but there isn’t,” he says. “When you have cash in your hand, you can count it, it’s quantifiable. But you can’t see or feel time, or put a real value on it. Because time is invisible, we have a hard time accounting for it.” Time is more like a slippery credit card, in that when you can’t see how much money you have, it’s easy to overspend. “‘Yes, I’m going to help my neighbour with her move, and do some volunteering, and take on a new work project,’” says Aeon. This is what’s known in psychological circles as the “yes … damn” effect. Damn, because only when it’s too late do you clock how much time all these commitments will take up. “Don’t worry about whether you’re wasting the time or using it well. If it’s something that you enjoy, it is time well spent,” says Herbert. All the academic literature backs this up, says Ciara McCabe, professor of neuroscience, psychopharmacology and mental health at the University of Reading, who spends her mornings outdoors with the dog. “It could be fly fishing, running or reading. It doesn’t really matter what it is, if you can derive pleasure and joy for yourself, it’s good for your mental health. It doesn’t even have to be creative; it could be time alone.” Thomas Moore was a Catholic monk as a young man, and has maintained an interest in our need for spiritual activities, whether religion is involved or not. “Simple things like listening to music shouldn’t be overlooked,” he says. Looking at art, too, but if you can’t get out to see art first thing, and don’t want to look at screens, when did you last have time to leaf through art books – or even spend time catching up on your favourite magazine, for that matter? Back in his monastery days, Moore says the main way the monks meditated was by taking walks. “That can be very spiritual, being outdoors in nature,” he says. It can also provide a healthy change of venue. “It’s one thing to take time out; it’s another to get out of the place you’re working constantly. It helps lift your spirits and keep things in perspective.” Herbert says her clients often complain that they have shelves full of books they don’t have time to read. “Well maybe just read every morning,” she says. “Think how many books you’d get through.” Sitting staring into space is equally valid and permitted, though. I have a working single mum friend who swears by setting her alarm half an hour before her kids wake so she can drink tea and listen to the radio in bed. Solitude is a lovely word, says McCabe. It means being alone but not lonely. “Some people find solitude very rewarding, while others are not looking for it. But there is research to suggest that for some people, solitude is very helpful, and they really enjoy it. A bit like a hobby, what they might get out of the solitude is time to reflect, make decisions, think clearly.” During the home schooling hell of the first lockdown, my inner introvert was screaming for independence – and eventually I found some. Getting up early to do yoga uninterrupted returned my relative sanity in the nick of time, and I inadvertently stumbled upon a new hobby. I had borrowed a moth trap, which I continued setting most nights, long after the children’s interest had waned. Disappearing to check the trap after breakfast, admiring and identifying my moths while a robin watched hungrily, was glorious. Whatever it is you like to do, says McCabe, “you’re releasing neurotransmitters that are involved in making you feel good.” And who can’t make time for that?",Lifestyle/Life and style,Gimme 20!

3/5/2022,"Just over a week after Russian rockets first began to slam into Ukraine, more than 1.2 million people have fled over the borders of neighbouring European countries into a frightening and uncertain future. What we are witnessing, the United Nations has warned, is the largest refugee crisis in a century. All week, the world has watched families fighting to board trains in chaotic crowds, fathers kissing their children goodbye through car windows, and seen the shock and exhaustion on the faces of those who have made it to safety. Most Ukrainians leaving their country are heading west into Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary, which have opened their borders to anyone trying to flee, although reports of pushbacks and racial discrimination against people of colour have emerged as the week has progressed. UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, is warning that the humanitarian crisis engulfing Ukrainians is just beginning. It estimates more than 4 million people will become refugees, while inside Ukraine millions more will be displaced by Russian bombs and rockets. Already more than 650,000 people have entered Poland, with between 50,000 and 80,000 more crossing every day. Many more are waiting up to 60 hours on the other side of the border in bleak and freezing temperatures. Polish aid organisations working at the border say their resources are stretched to breaking point. Hungary has seen the second-highest number of Ukrainians seeking refuge from the war, with more than 145,000 arriving since the invasion began. On Thursday, Albina, 42 and her 12-year-old daughter sat exhausted on plastic chairs in the village of Lónya, near the Hungarian border. Albina, who just a few days ago was a manager at a TV station in Kyiv, said she and her daughter slept in their car in an underground car park for two days as bombs fell. “When I saw that nothing was changing and it was getting worse, I thought we should run away because I’m afraid for my life and the life of my child,” she said. She plans to head for northern Europe. “I don’t know what to say. We are going there because we have nobody [here],” she added, starting to cry. Around Albina and her daughter, the local population has mobilised to help the refugees coming over the border into their quiet village. “It is an extraordinary operation by ordinary people,” said Andreas Kritharakis, 38. He quit his job at a poultry company to help with relief efforts when the war started last week. “When we go home and we think about what we do here, tears come to your eyes. Yesterday I cried, but this is the price we have to pay for the help we give,” he said standing in the entrance of the relief centre, which is full of people cooking or unloading supplies. The reaction from other European countries to the unfolding refugee crisis has also been swift and unified. EU member states announced that they would trigger the temporary protection directive, unused since it was created in 2001 after the wars in Yugoslavia and Kosovo. It will give Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years without a visa. An amendment changed the proposed text of the directive to only extend the protection to Ukrainian nationals instead of all refugees fleeing the war. The UNHCR has applauded efforts across Europe to deal with the refugee crisis but called on the current show of solidarity to be preserved throughout the coming months and, potentially, years as the violence escalates inside Ukraine. “As the situation continues to deteriorate and devastate, we know the numbers of people fleeing continue to rise exponentially. We trust European solidarity will continue,” it said. The UK’s response has been markedly different from that of its European neighbours. The British government initially said only Ukrainian nationals settled in the UK would be able to bring their “immediate family members” to join them. The UK immigration minister Kevin Foster suggested, in a now-deleted tweet, that Ukrainian refugees could apply to be fruit pickers. The Home Office has now said it will establish a “humanitarian sponsorship pathway” to enable organisations to sponsor Ukrainians to travel to the UK. Humanitarian experts have raised concerns about the future of millions of other refugees stuck at other European borders who have not been party to the same solidarity and hospitality being shown to Ukrainians. Last week, just days before the Russian invasion, the UNCHR condemned increasing violence and human rights abuses against asylum seekers at borders across Europe, describing a “callous disregard for life” as people were left adrift on life rafts in dangerous waters and stripped naked and pushed back over borders in harsh weather conditions. “The reaction of EU states to the refugee crisis in Ukraine is extraordinary,” said Jeff Crisp at Oxford University’s Refugee Studies Centre. “Yet in one way it almost institutionalises the difference between the reaction to the arrival of Ukrainians to the arrival of Iraqis or Syrians or other groups of asylum seekers at European borders. “The UNHCR talks of this being the largest refugee crisis in a century but, there are over 6 million Syrians who have fled the war in their country,” he said. “What we are seeing unfolding will test the resolve and capacity of our global refugee infrastructure. We must be prepared for what is to come.”",News/Global development,Ukrainians head west as UN warns refugee crisis is only just beginning,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/05/ukrainians-head-west-as-un-warns-refugee-crisis-is-only-just-beginning

3/5/2022,"When Castleton Mill in Leeds opened almost 200 years ago it housed steam-powered flax spinning machines. These days the former textile mill is part of another Industrial Revolution – the shift to plant-based food. The renovated mill, now a pet-friendly co-working space with a private bar, is home to alt-milk brand Mighty, one of the growing number of plant-based food companies based in Yorkshire. Tom Watkins, who co-founded Mighty with his brother Nick, says the county is fast becoming the Silicon Valley of plant-based food. “There are some absolutely fantastic companies and brands coming out of this area,” says the hoodie-wearing entrepreneur from across the company’s board table in what used to be the mill’s furnace. “We’re a family business and never entertained the notion of being anywhere else,” adds Nick. “We love it here and the people we have access to are incredible.” The list of plant-based companies in Yorkshire includes established names like Quorn as well as new ones like Meatless Farm, Plant and Bean, Over the Spoon and VFC. There is another crop coming up behind them, with almost 20 alt-food brands established in Yorkshire in the past year alone, according to Companies House data. Thijs Geijer, an economist at ING Research, says these emerging clusters are a “bit of a trend”. “In the US there’s the Protein Highway in the Midwest and in the Netherlands there’s Vegan Valley in the eastern part of the country.” The prize is a big one for the entrepreneurs who get it right. After a rapid growth spurt during the pandemic UK retail sales of alt-meat and dairy products are now more than £1bn a year. The demand for alt-meat and dairy products has been fuelled by consumer interest in health, animal welfare and sustainability, which was heightened during the pandemic. But with households budgets now being squeezed by inflation the “big question” says Geijer, is whether they will keep buying more of what are often more expensive products. Shares in Swedish alt-milk producer Oatly crashed about 20% one day in November on warnings about production delays and inflation, and have continued their slide since then. The share price of alt-meat firm Beyond Meat is also depressed after sales declined in the last three months of 2021. Ethan Brown, its chief executive, said he didn’t know if it was “an aberration or a harbinger of things to come”. However, with its quarter pounders, sausages and chicken breasts shaped from pea protein, Meatless Farm thinks the future is bright. It has raked in £30m from investors and is currently finalising another fundraising. The brightly coloured graphic painted on the facade of its office in The Calls makes it one of Leeds’ most Instagrammed spots. In jeans and trainers Michael Hunter, the UK managing director, says the six-year-old company’s sales are expected to triple to £31m this year. It has a big market to chase: UK retail sales of meat substitutes hit £600m in the UK last year, according to Mintel, a figure it forecasts to reach £855m by 2026. With its exposed brick walls, the office feels like a trendy warehouse apartment. Founded in 2016, the company benefits from links with local universities. Hunter says that it would be prohibitively expensive to have the same set-up – the office includes a development kitchen – in London. It now has 120 staff, about half of whom are based in the UK. In the kitchen there are containers of the pea protein that is the key ingredient in its food. The pale brown colour of Rice Krispies, the texture varies from a fine mince to chicken nugget-sized chunks. This unpromising-looking substance is transformed with the help of vegan beef stock, as well as beetroot, caramelised carrot and blueberry (to create the meat colour), says Ronnie Hayes, its innovation chef. Flecks of coconut and shea butter help replicate the sizzle of a beef burger as it cooks. The company aims to keep ingredients to a minimum. “Everyone looks at the back of the pack and if it looks like a chemistry set they might say that is not for me,” explains Hunter. “The hard thing is keeping the ingredient deck really clean but at the same time delivering a product that people go, wow, that is just like a meat burger.” On the top floor, with views across the city, a handful of beanie-hatted colleagues are tapping away on laptops, but on a Thursday morning it feels empty. “We have always been very flexible,” says Hunter. “Even when we talk to our customers, the buyers of the major retailers, they’re not in the office five days a week.” To cater for this new arrangement the company hires Airbnb properties near their homes for tastings. These plant-based food businesses are benefiting from a large hinterland of food expertise with the large county home to two leading supermarket chains, Asda and Morrisons, as well as the skilled work forces of large food groups, including Arla. The Watkins brothers, both in their 30s, started Mighty four years ago having spent the previous decade helping other companies get their products listed in UK supermarkets. With sales of plant-based alternatives to milk worth about £400m a year, the brothers saw a window of opportunity to do their own thing. But they are elbowing their way into a crowded marketplace that includes deep-pocketed rivals Oatly and Nestlé. Last year the company dropped Pea from its name because people associated the name with “something green that tastes like peas” says Nick. They think they are on to something with its new M.LK range, which like its other products is made with yellow split peas, but they reckon tastes “closer to milk than has ever been seen before”. It is getting noticed. So far Mighty has raised £8m with the most recent round, for £4.5m, led by two of Germany’s brewing dynasties: the Bitburger and Schadeberg families. The firm’s secret weapon, says Tom, is Aleksander Gontarz, its head of innovation and technical, who he describes him as the “Heisenberg of plant-milk – a reference to Walter White’s alter ego in Breaking Bad, the TV series about a chemistry teacher who became a kingpin in the methamphetamine drug trade. “He’s just extraordinary and knows this world inside out.” With M.LK it aims to convert cow’s milk drinkers, who still spend £3bn a year on the white stuff, explains Tom. “For Tarquin in Shoreditch who drinks pea milk, that’s an easy win but it’s a harder sell to Gary in Sheffield, who’s perhaps not used to what dairy alts can be,” he says. “Nestlé made a pea milk and we know from the supermarket data that we are still out selling Nestlé three to one,” he adds. “So yes, of course, big wallets help but they don’t necessarily dictate that you’re going to win. One the best things about grocery is it’s about the product. Customers vote with their feet.”",News/Business,Yorkshire startups vie for a slice of the meat and dairy substitute pie,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/05/yorkshire-start-ups-vie-for-a-slice-of-the-meat-and-dairy-substitute-pie

3/5/2022,"“Can we get a round of applause for Russia?” asked Nick Fuentes, on stage last week at a white nationalist event. Amid a roar of applause for the Russian president, just days after he invaded Ukraine, many attendees responded by shouting: “Putin! Putin!” It would be easy to dismiss the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC) in Orlando, Florida, as a radical fringe. But speeches by two Republican members of Congress – one in person, the other via video – guaranteed national attention and controversy. The backlash showed how the war in Ukraine has exposed the American far right’s affinity with Putin. That affinity is complicated by the tortured relationship between Russia and former president Donald Trump, whose rise Moscow supported with a covert operation to undermine US democracy. Fuentes, a notorious antisemite, created AFPAC to coincide with the more mainstream Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where Trump was the headline speaker last Saturday. At AFPAC, Fuentes introduced the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who would this week interrupt the State of the Union address, rising to yell “Build the wall!” as an objection to Joe Biden’s immigration policy. But here she did not interrupt to object to the chanting of the Russian president’s name. “I don’t believe anyone should be canceled,” Taylor Greene told the attendees of the white nationalist conference. She lashed out at a wide range of topics from Marxism to cancel culture but avoided the invasion of Ukraine, saying even less on the topic than Russian state media. Devin Burghart, executive director of Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights, said: “In the world of the white nationalists, you are seeing a lot of support for Putin, as expressed by the cheerleading at AFPAC over the weekend.” Others agree, pointing to a shared socially and culturally conservative ideology, disdain for democratic systems and appreciation for a “strong man” form of government. There was also the fact that it was the current Ukrainian government whom Trump attempted – and failed – to bribe to investigate his political rival Biden: actions which led to his first impeachment. Jared Holt, a domestic extremism researcher with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, said: “When Russia invaded Ukraine, large parts of the far right were supportive.” “The common thread is this idea that because of western European and US influence on Ukraine, Ukraine was a place where the same perceived downfalls of western society existed and Putin embodying a strong man authoritarian-type figure stepping in and inflicting suffering on Ukraine was viewed in a positive light.” Fuentes is certainly the real deal of white nationalism. He attended the deadly “Unite The Right” rally in 2017 and was recently subpoenaed over his involvement in the pro-Trump insurrection on January 6 2021. He now carries on that effort with AFPAC, aiming to create a kind of far-right archipelago by bringing together white nationalists, fascists and Trumpist crowds talking only to each other in their own islands. The three-year-old conference sees itself as part enfant terrible, piquing the genteel wing of the Republican party, and part Weimar-era beer hall organizing before the putsch. It is far right, but no longer on the fringe of Republican politics. Taylor Greene was condemned by some in her own party for speaking at AFPAC but is unlikely to be disciplined. And she was not alone. The Arizona congressman Paul Gosar made a video address. A lieutenant governor from Idaho and state legislator from Arizona also spoke at the event, which also attracted figures such as Gavin McInnes, the founder of the violent extremist gang the Proud Boys, which currently has more than three dozen members under indictment for the insurrection. This represents a disorienting shift for a Republican party once staunchly opposed to communism and the Soviet Union, which President Ronald Reagan dubbed “the evil empire”. But Trump, who in 2015 ran for president promising to build a wall and impose a Muslim ban, stoked the party’s nativist elements. And as America and the world grow more diverse, critics say, Russia has come to be seen as a beacon of salvation by white nationalists. In 2004 David Duke, a longtime leader of the Ku Klux Klan, described it as “key to white survival”. In 2017 Ann Coulter, a rightwing author and commentator, opined: “In 20 years, Russia will be the only country that is recognizably European.” Researchers who monitor far-right groups agree that the moment of Putin enthusiasm in the US has intellectual underpinnings with deeper roots. Burghart said: “For almost a decade the work of Russian fascist Alexander Dugin has found a home in American white nationalist circles.” Dugin’s ideology is steeped in Russian Christian nationalism and has chimed with Putin’s world view. At the same time, it echoes much of the Christian nationalist activism in the US, where liberal values, gay rights and a desire to keep religion out of the state, are seen as decadent and responsible for American decline. Burghart added: “There’s an attraction to Putin’s hardline authoritarian stand, his aggressive policies, they are attracted to his brand of traditional Christianity that Putin’s expressed. Some have liked Putin’s attacks on the Russian LGBTQ+ community.” On the eve of the Russian invasion, former Trump aide Steve Bannon hosted private security head Erik Princ, founder of the Blackwater military contracting group, on his popular War Room podcast. The two men – who are highly influential in Trumpist circles – praised Putin as “anti-woke”. Bannon declared: “Putin ain’t woke.” Attacks on wokeness were also a constant thread running through CPAC, which this year had the official slogan: “Awake not woke.” The legacy of the Trump years shapes the perception of Putin among the right in the US as Trump demonstrated a clear affinity for the Russian leader, even as details emerged of the Russian attempt in the 2016 election to disrupt US democracy. Trump himself praised Putin as “genius” and “smart” as the invasion began only to change his tune later as the military action faltered and casualties mounted. Even then, while condemning the assault, Trump told CPAC: “The problem is not that Putin is smart – which of course he’s smart – but the real problem is that our leaders are dumb.” The same was true of America’s most popular conservative broadcaster, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. Right up to the invasion Carlson was lambasting Ukraine as “not a democracy” and a puppet state of the US state department. He also praised Putin, saying: “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia?” That sort of language – contrasting Putin favorably against Democrats on mainstream US television – has an impact. Burghart commented: “After four years of praise for the Russian leader there’s a large swath of the right that has internalized that message. Some of the right have embraced Putin while others have been slow to denounce the invasion of Ukraine.” Burghart says some extremist rightwing militias even see Ukraine as a potential scenario to discuss how to prepare for urban warfare and a future insurgency in the US itself. Instead of horror at the outbreak of brutal urban warfare, some US extremists are obsessed with the idea of a coming civil war in America. “They see a societal collapse and need to prepare for an impending civil war, and their focus is on preparing for the battles of that here in the US,” Burgheart added.",News/US news,‘Key to white survival’: how Putin has morphed into a far-right savior,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/05/putin-ukraine-invasion-white-nationalists-far-right
3/5/2022,"It was a Sunday afternoon in the late 1980s and the house was filled with the fatty scent of roast lamb. I absentmindedly enquired about the origins of lunch and my brother pointed at the mewing sheep in the field adjacent to our house. I was a five-year-old boy, and I decided on the spot to become the first vegetarian in my family. My parents, while broadly supportive, were understandably bemused – and concerned. It was a less enlightened time, and my lack of dietary protein was a constant worry. They assuaged this by occasionally feeding me Chicken McNuggets under the not entirely misplaced logic that they weren’t really meat. After I’d cottoned on, I would sheepishly order a cheeseburger “without the burger” whenever we went to McDonald’s. I became accustomed to teasing and shaming – from digs at the apparently tasteless gruel I was consuming to the ubiquitous use of “gay” as an insult, mostly from guys who seemed offended by my decision to not eat dead things. I didn’t know anyone else – male or female – who was veggie. I hated ordering food when out with groups of lads because I knew there would be titters and comments about my masculinity. From the years I was at school right into my 2os, rarely a day passed without some sort of jibe about my diet. As a result, for many years I hid the real reason – claiming it was simply “habit” rather than sensitivity to animal welfare. Thankfully, non-animal diets are no longer a niche concern. McDonald’s even has a McPlant burger now, while vegan celebrities and Netflix documentaries are helping to normalise the concept of meat abstention or reduction. According to a 2019 survey commissioned by the Vegan Society, the number of UK vegans quadrupled to 600,000 between 2014 and 2019. Britons have reduced their meat intake by almost 17% in a decade, according to a 2021 study in The Lancet’s Planetary Health journal. Yet not everything has changed: the percentage of men taking part in Veganuary – which has grown from 168,000 to 580,000 participants since 2018 – dropped from 15% in 2018 to 13% in 2021. Research last year, published in the journal Plos One, also found that the diet of the average British male produces 40% more carbon emissions than that of females, largely due to increased meat consumption. Most men aren’t forgoing their bacon sarnies yet – and nor should we be surprised. They are still the target audience of the dirty burger and barbecue boom, as tattooed hipsters serve grilled meats from street food trucks. But how did meat become synonymous with laddishness in the first place? And at a time when cutting back meat and dairy is widely hailed as the simplest way to reduce our carbon footprint, does the best hope of convincing men to put down their kebabs really rest with a new generation of hench vegan bros? Carol J Adams is a Texas writer who, since the 90s, has explored the patriarchal connotations of meat consumption in books such as The Sexual Politics of Meat and The Pornography of Meat, which was recently updated and reissued. “We live in a world that’s heavily invested in a gender binary – that defines things as male or female,” she says. “The things associated with men are more highly valued. Every time a man becomes a vegan, it challenges basic assumptions about masculinity and femininity.” These outdated assumptions are rooted in the age-old gender roles of male as hunter and female as caregiver. Ed Winters, AKA Earthling Ed, is a British vegan activist and author with more than 400,000 YouTube subscribers. He says that online barbs about his supposedly compromised masculinity or sexuality are common. We speak over Skype: he’s in North America, visiting university campuses and talking one-to-one with students about veganism. “Almost all the people who debate me are men: they are certainly the ones most proud of eating meat,” he says. “Often they are proud of their lack of empathy for animals. I’ve never had that with a woman. I get called a ‘soy boy’ and there’s a lot of: ‘Ed must be gay, because he’s vegan.’” Over the past five years, “soy boy” has become a favourite insult of the far right online, used to refer not only to vegans but to all liberals. (I noticed the rise of this slur with amusement, as when I met my first ever male vegetarian friend, Lee, at university, we proudly called ourselves “the soy boys”.) These stereotypes endure in popular culture, whether it’s “steak and blowjob day” (which started as a satirical, meme-based idea that men deserve their “own” masculine equivalent of Valentine’s Day, on 14 March); Jeremy Clarkson declaring last summer that “normal people eat meat”; or Boris Johnson claiming in 2020 that veganism is “a crime against cheese lovers”. “Vegan men challenge what people traditionally perceive to be manly,” Winters says. “But what we perceive to be masculine is also a social construct, created by advertising, by media and by peer pressure.” The demonisation of non-animal diets can be traced back to what is now widely seen as the protein myth. The idea that protein is the key to strength, with meat the primary source, arose in the early 20th century. The Lancet set out the counterargument in a paper called The Great Protein Fiasco, published in 1974, and research has continually debunked the notion that a non-animal diet cannot provide enough protein. Caroline Farrell is a nutritionist who worked with Watford and Fulham football clubs between 2012 and 2018. “Five years ago it was very rare to have a male with a vegan diet,” she says. “Now I would say about 40% of my male clients are. It is very easy for a vegan diet to meet the recommendations for protein.” Farrell adds that a plant-based diet can help protect against chronic diseases such as colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. “Animal proteins are called complete proteins because they contain all the essential amino acids. Most plant proteins – except soya, quinoa and hemp – lack one or more of these. But vegans can easily obtain all the essential amino acids they need by eating a variety of plant proteins each day.” These could include soya products such as tofu or tempeh, dried beans, lentils, chickpeas, grains and nuts. It helps that veganism’s image is shifting. Take Netflix’s 2018 documentary The Game Changers, which follows UFC fighter James Wilks as he investigates the benefits of a plant-based diet for professional athletes. It was executive produced by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who appears alongside endurance runners, American footballers, boxers and strongmen who have all forsaken meat and dairy. (The Austrian Oak himself is reportedly 99% vegan now.) “The Game Changers powerfully illustrates that plant-based foods can deliver both strength and endurance in abundance,” says Richard McIlwain, CEO of the Vegetarian Society. “I’d argue that until very recently, the idea that meat provides protein, which equates to strength, was still a part of mainstream thinking.” McIlwain credits the influence of Lewis Hamilton, who co-produced The Game Changers and started following a plant-based diet in 2018. “Hamilton has blown the typically machismo, male, white Formula One environment open. He is a young Black man from a working-class background who is vegan and campaigns for animal welfare.” McIlwain also cites the rise of meat substitutes in supermarkets. “Steaks can be plant-based, and the protein content is advertised on the front as a clear selling point,” he says. “Men can still identify with cultural male stereotypes – positive or otherwise – without the meat.” Enter the “vegan bro” – the guy who has become plant-based as a device to accrue power and status; who isn’t afraid to show this to the world, especially on Instagram where shredded men come together under the #vegangains and #veganaf hashtags. The cult 2014 book Meat Is for Pussies: A How-to Guide for Dudes Who Want to Get Fit, Kick Ass, and Take Names conflates veganism with some grisly bro stereotypes in a bid to turn men away from what author John Joseph, seemingly without irony, calls the “chronic pussyism” of meat consumption. There are plenty of vegan Instagram bodybuilders – including Patrik Baboumian (who starred in The Game Changers) and Jordan Dranes, AKA Conscious Muscle – whose feeds are full of muscle shots but don’t lean on such tub-thumping stereotypes. A far more inflammatory figure is Richard Burgess – the 30-year-old Canadian vegan YouTuber known as Vegan Gains. He has 325,000 subscribers to his channel, and has transitioned from a vegan bodybuilder into a shock video jock aggressively debating diet and shaming omnivores. Among his many controversies is a video linking the cancer diagnosis of bodybuilder and fellow YouTuber Furious Pete to his non-vegan diet, and a 2015 episode in which he briefly uploaded a video of his grandfather having the heart attack that killed him – a cautionary tale, apparently, about the dangers of eating meat. Is this strand of veganism guilty of recycling the same old cliches about gender? A 2020 research paper analysed the behaviour of male vegan influencers and found that while vegan men often saw their dietary choices as evidence of a progressive outlook, they would do well to embrace “a feminist and intersectional veganism that is not dominated by … masculinist ideals”. The irony of vegan men referring to meat-eaters as “pussies” is not lost on Adams: “It’s not undoing the association with women and negativity.” She points to the term “hegan”, a portmanteau of he and vegan, coined in a 2010 article about male vegans and defined by the Urban Dictionary as “a trendy male vegan”. “It’s this need to not be associated with women, who are perceived by society to be more compassionate and empathic,” Adams says. “But the world needs more compassion. Why is compassion feared? How do we undo this situation so that men are no longer afraid of being compassionate?” For those seeking a middle path between the ethical vegan and the vegan bro, look no further than Henry Firth and Ian Theasby, founders of vegan food line and cookbook company Bosh!. The friends from Sheffield, both 37, adopted a plant-based diet in early 2015. Finding that everything in the vegan food sphere was “either old-fashioned and boring in design” (according to Firth) or skewed towards a yoga, beauty and wellness-focused audience, they started their YouTube channel BOSH.TV in 2016, posting snappy recipes for vegan burgers, pies, curries and pasta. They have put their names to six vegan cookbooks – their first is the UK’s bestselling – with their latest, Bosh! on a Budget, published last December. The branding is brash and unapologetic. Appealing to men without alienating women is important to them, Firth says. “Six or seven years ago, veganism was not seen as very male-friendly: everything was all lads, meat, steak and burgers. We wanted to show you can be a normal guy and eat vegan food.” They have noticed a transformation in their audience. “Following The Game Changers, it has become more acceptable for guys to admit to a plant-based diet,” Firth says. “Maybe the term plant-based is a way for people to say they’re not eating animals, but in a way they don’t feel is signing up to a certain ideology.” Nevertheless, they aren’t immune to pushback: trolls, mostly men, regularly hit their inbox. “They’ll send us DMs with all capital letters, about how they’re really enjoying a steak,” says Theasby, who points out that they receive most opprobrium for “commandeering” terms such as sausage, burger or steak for their plant-based recipes. Most notable was Piers Morgan, with whom they cheerily debated on Good Morning Britain in 2019. “Piers’s vibe was: ‘It’s fine to have your vegan food. Do as you wish. But stop stealing our words,’” Theasby says. Bosh! is just one of a number of male-friendly businesses now selling vegan products or lifestyles. The burgers, faux bacon and chicken pieces of THIS™ – whose single syllable name and blocky, black-and-white design aesthetic are thematically similar to Bosh! – are now found in Tesco, Sainsbury’s and chains such as Caffè Nero and Pho. The Happy Pear’s aspirationally handsome vegan twins, David and Stephen Flynn, have sold more than a quarter of a million cookbooks, building a million-strong social media reach with a mission to improve health, happiness and community. Meat and dairy consumption has become an issue of planetary urgency. A 2013 UN report found that 14.5% of our global greenhouse gas emissions were caused by the livestock industry, while a 2018 study in the journal Science stated that if we stopped consuming meat and dairy, farmland could be reduced by 75% while still feeding the planet’s population – effectively enabling us to rewild the world. “We must change our diet. The planet can’t support billions of meat-eaters,” said David Attenborough in his 2020 biographical documentary A Life on Our Planet. Confronting gendered stereotypes about meat-eating will certainly help. A US study released last November in the journal Appetite found that conformity (or otherwise) to traditional gender roles was still a good predictor of people’s meat consumption and openness to vegetarianism for environmental reasons. Among my male peers, the environmental arguments for meat reduction do seem to be gaining traction. At restaurants, I find my fellow diners to be sweetly, sometimes proudly, curious – happily commenting that my food looks tasty, and that they had a decent vegan burger only last week. Recently, I had a lively conversation about tofu preparation methods on an all-male WhatsApp group. This exchange would not have occurred until now – partly because I would have avoided having it. Meeting another vegetarian or vegan – especially a male one – used to be like finding a lone stranger in a foreign bar who loves your favourite band. Nowadays, it’s like everyone in the bar knows your band, likes the singles and is curious for the next album to arrive.

3/5/2022,"Rhubarb is a vegetable masquerading as a fruit. It’s usually used as a filling for a pie or crumble, but there are far more creative ways to make use of its bright, tart flavour than just pudding. It can be celebrated in chutneys, pickles, stews and salads, while its natural astringency means it’s also a fantastic accompaniment to all sorts of rich meat, fish and cheese, from duck, pork and lamb to oily mackerel and cheese. Tart rhubarb brings a citrussy vibrancy to this dish, cutting through the lamb’s fattiness in much the same way as lemon would.

Remove the lamb from the pan and put to one side, then add the onions to the pan and fry over a low heat until caramelised. Add the almonds and cinnamon, stir until toasted, then tip out of the pan and set aside. Pour the remaining ghee into the pan, add the honey and leave to bubble over a high heat until it starts to caramelise. Gently lower in the rhubarb and cook until it, too, is caramelised but still holds its shape. Remove from the pan and set aside. Return the onions, lamb and almonds to the pan, sprinkle over the ground ginger, coriander and cumin, and fry, stirring, until fragrant. Scatter in the bulgur, season, then cook the wheat until toasted. Pour the hot stock over the contents of the pan, cover with a lid and turn the heat to low. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the bulgur has absorbed the stock, then return rhubarb to the pan and cover the pan again, leaving the bulgur to steam for a further three to four minutes. Scatter over a handful of golden sultanas, crisp shallots and parsley, and serve. UK readers: click to buy these ingredients from Ocado Move over celery!

Add the egg yolk, then work in just enough iced water to bring everything together into a smooth, slightly tacky dough. Form into a ball, wrap and chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat a tablespoon of oil and the butter in a pan, then saute the chard stems and garlic, stirring often, until softened. Add the lemon zest and chard leaves, and cook until the latter wilt and soften. Season and add a good grating of nutmeg, then leave to cool. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. On a floured surface, roll out the pastry to a round of 30-34cm in diameter, and lift on to a large lined baking sheet. Spoon the chard mix on to the pastry, leaving a 4cm border free around the edges. Crumble the goat’s cheese over the chard, then fold in the pastry borders so they slightly overlap the filling. Brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg, then bake for 35 minutes, or until well browned. In a bowl, toss the shaved rhubarb with a drizzle of olive oil and the vinegar, season to taste, then pile on top of the cooked tart. Finish with a scattering of pine nuts and serve immediately.

3/5/2022,"Say you have been summoned to a lab and tasked with formulating the perfect British comedy. The details of the lab are not necessary for this, so stop asking. Stop asking who is funding this great experiment. It does not matter why they have chosen you, instead of someone qualified. We’re getting off topic. No, there are no windows. Well yes, fine, I suppose you could call it a “bunker” then. The point is: you have been summoned to a lab and tasked with formulating the perfect British comedy. It will be on BBC Two. So you guide your hand past the conical flask marked Mel & Sue and you dawdle over the petri dish with Jack Whitehall’s Dad in it, but finally you decide to add a big slosh of Tim Key to the broth (for this analogy to work, you really have to imagine a broth). Obviously, every action has an equal and opposite reaction so you need someone to balance out the – yes this is all getting away from me very rapidly, thank you! – pH, or something, so you decide upon Daisy May Cooper. To, uh, brew the broth in a giant still? Something like that, anyway. To do that thing you decide upon the Gibbons brothers as writers, after they did such an exceptional job of reinventing the Alan Partridge universe with This Time. As a catalyst you are allowed one little dash of Steve Coogan as a script consultant. For colour, you get a bit of Jessica Hynes. And for a concept, you have, “a witchfinder and a suspected witch go on a Trains, Planes and Automobiles-style odd-couple journey across the English countryside circa 1645”. Perfect, perfect, perfect! You have made every correct choice you possibly could. Right let’s put that in the oven for a bit and … ah. That’s a shame. It’s turned out really bad. It doesn’t make sense that The Witchfinder (BBC Two, from Tuesday) is as underwhelming as it is, because as mentioned above: all the ingredients were there. After being the go-to punchline guy in every single British comedy over the past 15 years, Tim Key was well overdue a good leading role, but this one isn’t right for him: his trademark bumbliness rubs up against the need of his character, witchfinder Gideon Bannister, to be liked and feared and respected. (As a thought experiment, if you get bored watching – which you will – imagine every line said by Coogan instead, and it does work better.) Cooper, so achingly funny in This Country, is superb as the suspected witch Thomasine Gooch, but woefully underused: the few bright spots in the first two episodes are when she does that blunt, straight-faced patter she’s so good at, but there is nowhere near enough of it. Hynes is completely wasted, and various other comic actors are given barely-there cameos and no punchlines to deliver. If you are fond of the witchfinder episode of Inside No 9 from a few years ago and are expecting more of the same, keep expecting. If you were hoping The Witchfinder might follow along the lines of Ghosts – another perfectly cast, slightly high-concept BBC comedy – think again. Ghosts remembered to make every character interesting and funny in their own right. The Witchfinder replaced all that with a too-slow-moving murder-mystery. You’re right, it’s hard to make people laugh. I read the comments section beneath these columns, sometimes, and see that sentiment expressed a lot. But to even try to start making people laugh – the thrust of every comedy, no? – you do have to actually write some jokes. The Witchfinder expends too much energy trying to tell some story – Key and Cooper have to go here this week, then they meet an obstacle, then they have to figure their way round it – and relies too much on the natural comic gifts of the two actors without giving them enough funny to play with. Key’s character is slimily unlikable, pathetically unbrave and greedily ambitious: there’s nothing redeemable to make me enjoy watching him for six episodes. Cooper’s disaffected one-liners could be the star of the show, but too often she’s used as a prop to get Key out of a self-imposed scrape. Hard to know who to blame for this really, but … well, no, I do. It’s your fault. You mixed all these ingredients up, in that lab I put you in, remember? You forgot to add jokes, you fool! Try again, and this time add some Whitehall!",Arts/Television & radio,The Witchfinder: even Daisy May Cooper can’t make this tedious comedy cast a spell,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/05/the-witchfinder-even-daisy-may-cooper-cant-make-this-bad-comedy-cast-a-spell
