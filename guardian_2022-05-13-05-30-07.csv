5/13/2022,"A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine when a Russian soldier accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian appears in the dock on Friday. The watershed moment comes as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine’s general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv’s district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened “dozens of metres” from the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. The case was this week filed at a criminal court. “He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,” said Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office said: “Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.” Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, a Russian soldier accused of rape and murder. He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while “threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons”.",News/World news,First Russian soldier to go on trial in Ukraine for war crimes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/first-russian-soldier-to-go-on-trial-in-ukraine-for-war-crimes
5/13/2022,"A copywriter’s recipe for a lemon swiss roll and amaretti trifle will become part of British food history after it was awarded the title of “platinum pudding” for the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. Jemma Melvin, 31, from Southport, beat off competition from four other finalists in the Fortnum & Mason platinum pudding competition to take the title. Her trifle follows in the footsteps of coronation chicken, serving as a long-lasting reminder of the 96-year-old monarch’s reign. Earlier this year, Fortnum & Mason challenged the UK to create a recipe fulfilling the criteria of being fit for a queen. Requirements included a memorable story, the perfect taste and a recipe simple enough for home bakers. The winner was finally announced on BBC One’s The Jubilee Pudding: 70 Years in the Baking on Thursday night, after a unanimous decision by a panel of judges including Dame Mary Berry and the chef Monica Galetti. Melvin’s trifle, consisting of lemon curd swiss roll on the bottom, St Clement’s jelly, lemon custard, amaretti biscuits, mandarin coulis, fresh whipped cream, candied peel, chocolate shards and crushed amaretti biscuits on top, wowed judges at the first mouthful. Responding to her triumph, Melvin said the first thing she had to do was tell her grandmother. “She is the person that taught me how to bake and I am so excited to tell her. She’s going to be so proud, I can’t wait,” she said. “I am so happy, thank you so much, Mary. It’s been an honour as well to have your feedback. It’s just meant the world to me. The thought of people recreating my pudding, especially round the jubilee, is just a total pleasure.” The Duchess of Cornwall, patron of the Big Jubilee Lunch, was a surprise special guest and announced the winning recipe. Dame Mary, chair of the judging panel, called it “absolutely wonderful”. She added: “I think Britain is going to be so delighted and the Queen, too.” Galetti said: “I love lemon and sometimes people hold back, and they’re scared to put that lemon into it, and as you’re eating it you’re thinking, ‘oh it can’t get any better’. I got chunks of the amaretti biscuit that have soaked up the cream and they’re chewy and I am so happy right now.” Melvin, who has baked since the age of six, said she was inspired by her gran and her nan. “My gran is with us but sadly my nan is not, they are both extremely important to me. My gran taught me how to bake but my nan’s signature dish was a trifle. A wonderful, poised lady, just like our queen, she used to make a wonderful trifle, but hers was laced with sherry and decorated with kiwifruit and flaked chocolate but this trifle is elevated and fit for the Queen herself.” Melvin, who lives with her long-term partner, James, and their rescue-dog, Bella, said she found out that the Queen had lemon posset at her wedding and decided her pudding had to be based on a lemon flavour. “My gran and my nan, they very much liked lemon as well, so it all just slotted into place. I think it’ll be perfect for jubilee celebrations as it’s refreshing for summer,” she said. “It can also be made in a large dish or in individual portions – whichever you’d prefer.” There were nearly 5,000 entries to the competition, coming in from Land’s End to Duncansby Head. A shortlist of 50 was judged “blind” – purely by recipe alone – until five bakers were announced as finalists. Melvin faced off strong competition from her fellow finalists, Kathryn, Sam, Shabnam and Susan. Fortnum & Mason’s executive pastry chef and judge, Roger Pizey, said: “I really think we’ll be making Jemma’s trifle for at least the next 50 to 100 years, without a doubt.” The company will support the Big Jubilee Lunch from 2-5 June, giving the winning platinum pudding recipe to the country alongside expert baking tips. All profits from the sale of the pudding in Fortnum & Mason shops will be donated to two UK charities: Centrepoint and the Big Jubilee Lunch, part of the Eden Project.",News/UK news,No mere trifle: amateur baker creates ‘platinum pudding’ fit for the Queen,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/platinum-pudding-jubilee-swiss-roll-queen

5/13/2022,"New Zealand’s dairy industry is under pressure. It is one of our biggest earners, accounting for roughly 3% of our GDP; and since cows were first brought here about 200 years ago, dairy farming has taken on cultural significance for Pākehā (NZ Europeans) especially. But it is also attracting increasing scrutiny. As well as polluting our land and waterways, dairy is to blame for large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Jacinda Ardern’s Labour government has developed legislation to mitigate environmental pollution, but critics say it is not adequately addressing the harm dairying causes. The industry received even more unwanted attention recently with the release of award-winning documentary Milked, which follows Māori activist Chris Huriwai (Ngāpuhi, Ngati Porou, Te Ātiawa) as he reflects on his awa (river), Mangatawa, at Ōtaua, and exposes the negative impacts of dairy for Aotearoa and the world. And in March, Safe, New Zealand’s leading animal rights organisation, launched its Done with Dairy campaign, highlighting its harms. In response to such criticism, the dairy industry is fighting for credibility. One strategy it appears to be using is what we might call “kei te pai-washing” – or “pai-washing” for short. Like “whitewashing”, which aims to cover up unpleasant facts, or “greenwashing”, which paints organisations as more environmentally-friendly than they really are, pai-washing uses Māori words, concepts and imagery to exploit the association between te ao Māori (the Māori world) and environmental responsibility – almost like an “Indigenous tick of approval”. It is a cynical attempt to convey the impression that everything is “kei te pai”, or “all good”, with this extremely harmful practice. In my opinion, Fonterra, New Zealand’s largest dairy company, has become especially adept at pai-washing. More recently, it contracted a kaiwhakairo (carver) “to tell our story through the creation of a pou”, a traditional expression of Māori connectedness to land. But is dairy really “kei te pai”? Anyone who has travelled through New Zealand knows that much of the land now consists of paddocks. Most of this was cleared in the mid- to late-19th and 20th centuries – desecration which left Aotearoa bereft of its native forests, as well as birds, insects, reptiles and amphibians. Historically, it is mainly sheep which have been farmed here; but over the last 30 years or so, dairy farming has intensified, and so has its degradation of the environment. Of course, some Māori communities have also chosen to engage in dairying – but the reasons for this are complex. Economic marginalisation, resulting from dispossession, land confiscation and racism, has left us with fewer choices than we once had. And the desire to stay connected to our whenua (land) has sometimes made dairying seem more viable. But the notion that dairy can somehow be made sufficiently “sustainable” is a myth – and it is one that focuses only on the environmental impacts of the industry, ignoring its health impacts for consumers and workers, and the lives and wellbeing of the animals it exploits. Dairying is not simply unsustainable; it violates Māori values. As Māori, we understand ourselves as kaitiaki – carers for te taiao (the natural world). Although some dairy companies would have us believe that farmers are kaitiaki, such environmentally destructive work is ultimately incompatible with tiakitanga (caregiving). Another value, whanaungatanga, recognises that we are related, through ancestry, not only to each other, but to the wider natural world as well. Consequently, we have responsibilities to treat it respectfully. But far from treating the more-than-human world with respect, the dairy industry is extractive, engaging in a one-sided transaction: as ecofeminists have argued, it exploits female bodies, by forcefully impregnating cows, stealing their milk and separating mothers from calves. Worse, it slaughters individuals who are more profitable to stakeholders dead than alive. (Considering how much death Fonterra’s farmers are complicit in – of bobby calves as well as dairy cows – it is ironic that the company uses the slogan Dairy for Life to sell itself.) Dairying also undermines hauora (wellbeing). Research has linked dairy consumption to diabetes, heart disease and cancer – all of which impact Māori at disproportionate rates. And it is likely that, on average, Māori are more lactose-intolerant than Pākehā. Just as concerning are the psychological impacts on workers charged with killing animals, including newborns. It isn’t just big corporations that must stop. Ultimately, Māori need to divest from dairy too. Those who defend Māori involvement in dairying sometimes cite “rangatiratanga” as a principle that allows us to do what we want. “Rangatiratanga” is often interpreted narrowly, as “sovereignty”, or “self-determination”; but it also involves responsibility – to others and to the wider world. It requires us to strive for ways of living that are respectful, nurturing and sustainable. And if you listen attentively, you will hear that many Māori communities who are exercising rangatiratanga are, in fact, moving away from dairy. Some hapū (subtribes) have started transitioning their dairy operations to traditionally inspired ventures, focusing instead on regenerating native bush and growing crops for their people. At the same time, many iwi (tribes) are investing in sustainable alternatives to dairy, such as housing and horticulture. This connects to broader efforts to restore whenua, reinvigorate traditional Māori gardening practices, promote food and soil sovereignty, and become para kore (waste-free). These aspirations are reflected in Aotearoa’s ever-changing culture: in our growing sustainability movement and in the increasing number of New Zealanders – Māori and non-Māori – who are embracing vegetarian, vegan and kaimanga (Māori plant-based) living. There is a better way forward. The rest of Aotearoa will appreciate this if – instead of misusing Māori culture – they listen to Māori and learn about the alternatives we are developing, with aroha (love) for the environment, non-human animals and people.

5/13/2022,"A Chilean journalist who was shot in the head by a street trader while covering Workers’ Day marches on 1 May has died of her injuries. Francisca Sandoval, 29, was reporting in Barrio Meiggs, a ramshackle market district in the centre of the capital, Santiago, when a group of men opened fire after a standoff with the marchers. A bullet pierced Sandoval’s visor, leaving her fighting for her life in hospital. Two other journalists were injured in the shooting. “Francisca didn’t leave us, they murdered her,” tweeted Señal 3 La Victoria, the independent media outlet Sandoval had been reporting for. “With these words we confirm the death of our dear Fran. We will miss you and will do everything possible to find the truth.” Two days after the shooting, Marcelo Naranjo, 41, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, illegally carrying a firearm and unjustified discharge of a firearm in public. Following Sandoval’s death, Chile’s public prosecutor confirmed that the charges would be reviewed. A Colombian and a Venezuelan citizen were also held under house arrest in connection with the incident. Sandoval is the first journalist to be killed in the line of duty in Chile since the Pinochet dictatorship. The last, José Carrasco, was kidnapped from his home 36 years ago in 1986, days after a failed attempt on the dictator’s life. His body was found three hours later riddled with bullets - and so disfigured that even his wife was unable to properly identify it. In 2022’s World Press Freedom Index, published earlier this month by Reporters Sans Frontières (RSF), Chile plummeted to 82nd place – although still the fifth highest-ranked in South America. The report highlighted the overwhelming concentration of media ownership in Chile – a longstanding issue in the country, where two main groups dominate traditional media. “Chile is living through a difficult period with regard to violence, and particularly violence towards media outlets,” said Carolina Muñoz, director of the University of Chile’s journalism faculty. “This was evident during the protests in 2019, when we saw how journalists were hounded while carrying out their work, and we have also seen how groups formed to target journalists.” Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, 36, who had visited Sandoval’s family at hospital earlier in the week, lamented her death and vowed that those responsible would be held accountable.",News/World news,Chilean journalist dies after being shot while covering Workers’ Day marches,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/francisca-sandoval-chilean-journalist-dies
