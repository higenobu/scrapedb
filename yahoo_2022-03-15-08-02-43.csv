3/15/2022,"By Scott DiSavino NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices fell more than 5% on Monday to the lowest in nearly two weeks amid hopes for progress toward a diplomatic end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine - a development that would boost global supplies - while a pandemic-linked travel ban in China cast doubt on demand. Brent futures fell $5.77, or 5.1%, to settle at $106.90 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $6.32, or 5.8%, to settle at $103.01. That was the lowest close for WTI since Feb. 28 and the lowest for Brent since March 1. Both benchmarks have surged since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and are up roughly 36% so far this year. ""Oil prices are reflecting a bearish sentiment drawn from expectations of positive developments in the latest round of Russia-Ukraine negotiations,"" said Kaushal Ramesh, an analyst at energy research provider Rystad Energy. Russian and Ukrainian delegations held a fourth round of talks on Monday - by video link rather than in person in neighboring Belarus as in the past - but no new progress was announced. Ukraine said it held the talks with Russia on a ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops and security guarantees despite the fatal shelling of a residential building in Kyiv. Brent and WTI have logged their most volatile 30 days since June 2020. Analysts at energy consulting group EBW Analytics noted that ""a renewed COVID outbreak in China is leading to rising shutdowns as Omicron spreads rapidly,"" which could reduce global energy demand since China is the world's largest importer of oil, liquefied natural gas and coal. A northeastern Chinese province imposed a rare travel ban due to an Omicron outbreak. Russia's output of oil and gas condensate rose to 11.12 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in March, two sources familiar with production data told Reuters, despite sanctions. The United States has banned Russian oil imports and Britain said it would phase them out by the end of 2022. Russia is the world's top exporter of crude and oil products combined, shipping about 7 million bpd or 7% of global supplies. A senior minister said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to boost oil output, while International Energy Agency (IEA) chief Fatih Birol urged oil-producing countries to pump more. European Union member states have agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia, the office of the French EU presidency wrote on Twitter. It did not include Russian energy exports. ""Energy traders quickly abandoned the crude trade after the next round of EU sanctions spared oil from Russian companies,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at data and analytics firm OANDA. India indicated it could release more oil from national stocks. Indian officials also said New Delhi was considering a Russian offer to buy crude and other commodities at discounted prices via a rupee-rouble transaction. The United States needs to make a decision to wrap up a deal to salvage Iran's 2015 nuclear accord with world powers, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said. Some feared talks might collapse, and 49 of 50 Republican U.S. senators said they would not back a new nuclear deal. Analysts said an agreement with Iran could add another 1 million bpd of oil supply to the market, but noted that would not be enough to offset declining supply from Russia. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates this week, which should boost the dollar. This could push down oil prices by making dollar-denominated oil more expensive for holders of foreign currencies. Crude stockpiles at the Cushing storage hub in Oklahoma rose last week for the first time this year, traders said, referring to a report from data provider Genscape. U.S. government data has shown stockpiles there falling for nine weeks in a row.

3/15/2022,"Some of the most well-known oil stocks have further room to run amid elevated oil and gas prices, says strategists at Goldman Sachs. And they point to several fundamental factors for their ongoing bullishness. ""We continue to believe upstream energy companies are favorably set-up in the current commodity upcycle (1) to generate double-digit free cash flow, which should allow for attractive capital returns and/or balance sheet improvement and thus allow for shares to outperform; (2) to undergo favorable consensus revisions in 2022 (we see 42% upside to consensus operating cash flows and 57% upside to EPS); and (3) given attractive valuation at our long-term Brent oil price of $90/bbl (vs. $80/bbl prior) despite our expectations for higher incremental inflation. Given the highly volatile commodity price environment, we continue to recommend a beta barbell strategy and prefer companies where we see dislocations on valuation relative to asset quality and where higher free cash flow from the current upcycle can drive greater capital returns relative to consensus expectations,"" explains Goldman Sachs' Neil Mehta. Goldman lists 12 oil stocks it's particularly locked in on: Hess (HES), Ovintiv (OVV), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), ConocoPhillips (COP), Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY), PDC Energy (PDCE), Antero Resources (AR), Kosmos Energy (KOS), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Coterra Energy (CTRA), and EQT Corp. (EQT). The investment bank notes these 12 stocks have average upside potential of 32% and a forward dividend yield of 4%. Traders may not be too shocked to see Goldman's calls here. Oil prices are off their highs of nearly $139 a barrel on optimism U.S. oil majors such as Exxon and Chevron will produce more to make up for any lost Russian output amidst its war on Ukraine. Even still, oil prices remain above $100 a barrel reflecting the geopolitical risk. Some on the Street have warned recently that oil prices could still surge to $200 a barrel. Berkshire Hathaway billionaire Warren Buffett has been scooping up shares of Occidental Petroleum this month as oil prices have soared. Says Mehta on the move in Occidental, ""At our bullish commodity prices in 2022 estimate, we expect the company to generate ~$20 billion in free cash flow (37% of market cap before including the dilution impact from the warrants), which should allow for $3 billion in share repurchase + fixed dividend (~6% capital returns yield) and potential for further debt reduction. We continue to see potential for greater investor credit towards the company’s Upstream, Chemical and Low Carbon assets as Occidental continues to delever.""
