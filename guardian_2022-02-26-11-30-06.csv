2/26/2022,"On Tuesday, a 7-year-old girl arrived at her Las Vegas elementary school with a stash of sticky notes in her hand, which she gave to her teacher. The notes, from her mother, were a cry for help. The woman wrote that she was being held captive by her boyfriend and feared that her 4-year-old son, who she had not seen for weeks, was dead, according to her attorney. After the teacher notified authorities, police went to the home of Brandon Toseland, where they found the body of Mason Dominguez in Toseland’s freezer. Toseland, 35, has since also been charged with murder and two counts of kidnapping. The woman told her lawyer, Stephen Stubbs, that Toseland sexually, physically and emotionally abused her for months. Toseland isolated her from her family, took away her phone and car keys, controlled her social media accounts and quit her job on her behalf, Stubbs told the Washington Post. He also allegedly installed locks, video surveillance and monitor sensors to track the woman’s movements, Stubbs told the Post. “It just got worse to the point where, finally, in December, there was one day she tried to exit a room and it was locked …and from then on she was held captive.” A statement released by Las Vegas metropolitan police department on Wednesday said the woman was “not allowed to leave the house alone or enter the garage”. In addition, “she also confirmed she had not seen her toddler since December 2021, and she believed he was deceased”. Homicide detectives assumed the investigation and discovered the child’s remains inside a freezer in the garage, the statement said. According to Stubbs, the woman met Toseland through her late husband. After her husband died in January last year, Toseland started to comfort her and the pair began dating two months later. She and her kids went on to move in with Toseland, which “started out fantastic”, Stubbs told Insider. However, from the time that she was locked up to when she was rescued, the woman never had a chance in which she could run away with her daughter. Toseland, who sent the 7-year-old girl to school every morning, would bring along the woman and leave her handcuffed in his car, concealed behind a sun shield. Every day, the woman searched for something to help her escape. She eventually found a stash of sticky notes and a pen. “It was a game of him leaving and her knowing that she has less than a minute to take the sticky notes and the pen from their hiding spot, write whatever she could and then hide it before he could come back … and keep in mind, she can’t even see through the front windshield to know when he’s going to be back,” Stubbs said. Eventually, the woman completed the note and a few days prior to her rescue, Toseland allowed her to sleep in the same room with her daughter. That night, the woman repeatedly coached her daughter on how to deliver the note to her teacher and what to say, according to Stubbs. Police were able to track down Toseland after they set up surveillance around his house and saw him exit the car with the woman. Since her rescue, the woman and her daughter have been staying with relatives and are receiving “all the help they need”, said Stubbs. Scott Coffee, Toseland’s attorney, told the Washington Post that he plans on seeking a mental health evaluation for Toseland and said that it is “too early in the case to know what happened”. “His criminal history is minimal,” Coffee said, referring to the two counts of domestic battery that Toseland has been charged with after being arrested in 2018, to which he pleaded no contest. Toseland is detained in county jail and will appear in court next Monday.",News/US news,A woman’s boyfriend was holding her captive.

2/26/2022,"The past day has focused on the capital, Kyiv. Russian forces entered the outskirts on Friday and were threatening from the north-west and east in an attack aimed at seizing the city. Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned of a difficult night ahead for the capital: “This night will be the hardest,” the Ukrainian president said in an address. “This night the enemy will be using all available means to break our resistance. This night they will launch an assault.” Many Ukrainians are preparing to fight. City authorities have urged residents to stay home but prepare molotov cocktails for a citizen uprising against Russian fighters if they break through defensive lines. In one district they handed out rifles to any citizen who wanted to fight, and the defence ministry has opened the army to any Ukrainian citizen. Explosions have rocked Kyiv, with residents taking cover in shelters and underground stations. A woman has reportedly given birth in one station where she had been sheltering with other residents. The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west of Kyiv, while Russian tanks were filmed by people in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning. “More than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in less than 48 hours – a majority to Poland and Moldova,” said the UN refugee agency head Filippo Grandi, adding that “many more are moving towards its borders”. Photos have shown enormous queues of cars heading for Ukraine’s western borders. On Friday, guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv’s central station as thousands of people tried to force their way on to evacuation trains. Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people”. The US department of defence has confirmed that a Russian “amphibious assault” has been launched in Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. “Many cities of our state are under attack: Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys and girls in the Donbas, the cities of the south, special attention to Kyiv,” Zelenskiy said. “We can’t lose the capital.” Zelenskiy pleaded for international help and for western powers to act faster to cut off Russia’s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,” he said. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” Prominent Russians have joined protests in Russia or spoken out against the invasion, amid at least 1,800 arrests at anti-war rallies. They include pop stars, chat show hosts and newspaper correspondents who have gone public despite the professional and personal risks that come with dissenting from Vladimir Putin. Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an “existential” war between Russia and the west. The EU and the UK have moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The initiative is largely symbolic but followed recognition that appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy had to be heard. The UN security council voted on a resolution deploring the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE), and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto, the resolution was not upheld. The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organisation’s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine”. Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this year’s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could “bring the competition into disrepute”.",News/World news,Russian forces advance inside Ukraine: what we know so far,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/russian-forces-advance-inside-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far
