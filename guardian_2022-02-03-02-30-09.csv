2/3/2022,"Officials in Canada have called for an end to an “unlawful” truck blockade near the US border, amid mounting tensions between protesters opposing Covid health restrictions and local residents. The standoff near the Alberta border town of Coutts has entered its fifth day, with dozens of trucks blocking access to a key highway used to enter the United States. The town is a key border crossing for Alberta’s meat exports and imports of livestock feed.  Police issued an ultimatum to protesters on Tuesday, threatening them with arrest if they remained on the road. A small group left, but many trucks remained. Others breached a police barricade to join the blockade. The Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, condemned the “unlawful” blockades, calling on protestors to disband and return home. He told reporters people sympathetic with the protests had assaulted police and someone tried to ram RCMP members. “Without hesitation, I condemn those actions and I call for calm amongst anybody who feels sympathetic to those engaged in this blockade,” said Kenney. After a series of Indigenous-led blockades paralyzed rail traffic in 2020, Kenney’s government passed a law that allows for additional penalties against protesters blockading highways and other infrastructure. In Ottawa, protesters associated with a truck convoy that arrived over the weekend have also refused to leave. Residents have become increasingly frustrated with the blaring truck horns and a number of local businesses have shuttered. The Rideau Centre, a popular mall downtown, announced it would remain closed until 6 February. “I get it, I hear you, but we have to let the people of Ottawa live their lives,” the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, said Tuesday. Protesters released a statement on Wednesday, saying they sympathized with residents over the disruption to daily life, but added trucks would only leave once the federal government repealed its public health restrictions, many of which are under provincial and municipal jurisdiction. Many senior Conservative lawmakers have embraced the movement, prompting accusations of hypocrisy, after those same parliamentarians called for police to disband Indigenous-led blockades in 2020.",News/World news,Truck convoy protesting Covid restrictions blocks key US-Canada crossing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/truck-convoy-blockade-canada-covid
2/3/2022,"Anand Menon rightly points out that the disastrous effects of Brexit on trade, tax rises and growth are now becoming apparent (Covid has been an easy scapegoat for economic disruption, but Brexit is biting, 31 January). He’s right, too, to note that Covid has become an easy scapegoat for economic disruption. However, the political realignment also brought about by Brexit seems to offer little chance for reopening the process of rejoining the EU, given that it resulted from a referendum whose legitimacy we all have to accept, however reluctantly. Membership of the European Economic Area could be the answer. Nothing on the referendum voting slip committed us to the hard Brexit to which we find ourselves condemned. Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway are also outside the EU, but covered by the EEA agreement that guarantees their compliance with EU legislation on the single European market, competition and employment rights. Prof Menon observes that 57% of Britons now think the government is handling Brexit badly, so surely they too will increasingly want to find a way through. EEA membership would allow us to remain outside the EU while regaining some of the practical advantages of EU membership. It would also put us in a stronger position to rejoin the EU if and when the electorate so decided.Michael GoldEmeritus professor of comparative employment relations, Royal Holloway, University of London   Once again it is claimed that the economists who opposed Brexit warned that it would lead to catastrophe (The post-Brexit economic crisis never materialised – Labour is right to move on, 31 January). At the time (2016), serious observers such as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted that the long-run fall in GDP resulting from a Brexit where we left the single market would be 3.2% and 5.1% respectively. Split the difference and we get a fall of a bit over 4%, roughly what the Office for Budget Responsibility currently believes. “Long run” means comparing the situation in, say, 2030 with what would have happened if we had stayed in. No catastrophe, no crisis, just a slow-burn decline in national wellbeing. When Keir Starmer said there was “no case” for rejoining, I take it that meant there is no realistic possibility, not that staying out somehow makes us wealthier.Simon PriceProfessor of finance, Essex Business School  Last week, I ordered five copies of my book about the Spanish civil war from a UK publisher for delivery to Madrid. The wholesale cost of the books and postage was £48. The carrier then demanded an additional €40 to cover the tariff charged on the delivery of goods from a non-EU country. Evidently, this Brexit tax nearly doubles the cost of the transaction. Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, recently made the welcome pledge that the next Labour government would be “pro-business”. But she then said that she saw no prospect of the UK rejoining the single market for the next 50 years. It is hard to reconcile the two statements. Businesses across the country are complaining about the barriers they must now leap to trade with the EU. Labour’s reticence in talking up the benefits of integration with the EU single market is a policy choice that the party must revise.Dr David MathiesonMadrid  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/3/2022,"Your editorial (30 January) says that boosting the sentencing power of magistrates is the wrong way to reduce the backlog of criminal cases. I agree. There is a more effective solution, and that is to restrict the number of “either way” cases that defendants can elect to have heard in the crown court. There are three categories of criminal offence. One (eg assault, criminal damage up to £5,000) can only be tried in magistrates courts. One (eg murder, firearms offences) can only be tried in crown courts. In the middle are “either way” cases (eg theft, burglary), which magistrates can accept, but defendants have the right to elect to have heard in crown courts – and often do.  This creates anomalies. Three magistrates will hear a case where £4,000 worth of criminal damage to property is alleged, but a charge of stealing a £6 chicken goes to jury trial in a crown court if the defendant wishes, and it will be many months, if not years, before the case is heard. Extending magistrates’ sentencing powers will have little impact on the crown court backlog. Recategorising the less serious “either way” offences so that they can only be heard in magistrates courts would immediately relieve the workload in crown courts.Nicky OttawayBletchingley, Surrey  It’s pleasing to see the Guardian shine a light on the problems plaguing our criminal justice system. The £135m-a-year funding increase recommended in the independent review of criminal legal aid should be implemented immediately. Otherwise, we fear that criminal defence solicitors will leave at ever faster rates, seriously compromising the government’s ability to clear the huge backlog in the criminal courts. Hundreds of criminal defence firms have shut their doors over the past decade. Our research shows that the solicitors who remain are ageing, and some areas risk being left with insufficient criminal duty solicitors to answer the call when someone needs representing in a police station. You can pour all the money you like into policing and prosecution, but without a healthy criminal defence profession, British justice will cease to exist.I Stephanie BoycePresident, Law Society of England and Wales  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/3/2022,"“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Beijing Games 2022! Let me hear your voice!” And so to the Ice Cube for the mixed curling for an intriguing first day of action at these XXIV Winter Olympics. Before the opening stone was cast, a Chinese military band of bagpipers dressed in kilts blasted out Scotland the Brave, while a dancing panda mascot pulled shapes. But the surreal soon turned into the reassuringly familiar as the British gold-medal favourites, Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds, secured an opening night victory over Sweden. Unlike at the Tokyo Summer Games last year, a select band of around 200 spectators were also on hand to watch this most slow-burning of sports – although whether the crowd was quietly enthralled, or merely bored, was unclear until they exploded into sustained cheers after China won a sudden-death match over Switzerland.  Don’t be surprised if a similar switch gets flicked in Britain over the coming fortnight, just as it did when Rhona Martin inspired Team GB’s women to curling gold in Salt Lake City 20 years ago. Britain’s men and mixed doubles teams are world champions, and the women recently won the European title. True, it is early days. But there is a notable confidence that a three-pronged attack on the medal table is not out of the question. “We will be trying to improve on that but it is a great start,” Mouat said, after a match that was not nearly as comfortable as the 9-5 scoreline suggests. “We know Sweden will be at the top of the table at the end of the week so we are really chuffed with how we played.” Mouat also conceded that hearing the bagpipers put a spring in his step, adding: “We saw them outside the venue a couple of days ago so we knew they were here and were excited. They did not disappoint.” Meanwhile Dodds believes the friendship between the pair could make all the difference when the mixed doubles gets down to the business end next week. “We’ve known each other since we were 10,” she said. “The fact that we’re friends from way back and the dynamic that we have has helped us. We’re not getting at each other’s throats if we’re down in a game; we’re being positive and trying to get each other’s momentum going.” These Games do not officially kick off until Friday’s opening ceremony, but after a week dominated by criticism from human rights groups and rising Covid cases inside the Olympic bubble, with 11 people now hospitalised, organisers will be relieved that some of the world’s focus can now be diverted towards the field of play. That message was conveyed by the front page of the China Daily’s Winter Olympics supplement. Its headline? “Gold Vision: How President Xi’s leadership is delivering ‘fantastic, extraordinary and excellent’ Winter Games’. “Beijing’s vision of hosting a sustainable Winter Olympics is materialising in a big way, with the Games’ venues and projects primed to benefit local communities and the economy far beyond the closing ceremony,” was the message. The official mouth organ for the Chinese government also hailed the three curling tournaments – which are all 10-team round-robin events, leading to a semi-final and final – and the fact the games are being staged at the same venue where Michael Phelps won a record eight Olympic gold medals. Incredibly after a feat of engineering worthy of Brunel, what was nicknamed the Water Cube in 2008 has temporarily become the Ice Cube. The work has required organisers to completely drain the 50m pool before complex scaffolding and mounting plates went in, and an insulating and waterproof layer were put down. Finally a removable ice making system was installed and the ice was sculptured and sprayed. And, just like that, a 10-lane Olympic swimming pool became a four-sheet curling rink. “To be in the same arena as all those amazing athletes before such as Phelps and Rebecca Adlington means a lot to us,” Mouat said. “Hopefully we can keep it going.” A range of sensors in the building are designed to monitor the temperature of the ice and facility. But there were some understandable teething issues, with the British team struggling to read the ice as it slowed during the course of their match. “Both teams noticed around the fifth it was just starting to slow a wee bit and then we just had to play that bit heavier,” Dodds explained. That may have been a factor in a patchy performance that was only settled on the final end. With Team GB 8-5 up, Sweden had an easy shot to take the match to sudden death only for Sweden’s Almida de Val to miss a sitter. “We expect them to make most of their shots and this time we were fortunate it went our way,” Dodds said. “We set up a good end and I just missed one with my last. We can build on it.” While Britain, the USA and many western countries have announced they will stage a diplomatic boycott of the Games, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin is coming to Beijing, and Saudi Arabia leader Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistan’s Imran Khan are expected to attend the opening ceremony. Putin and Xi are also expected to sign a deal to increase capacity of the Power of Siberia, a 2,485-mile pipeline that transfers gas from eastern Russia to China. That is another sign that sport and politics are intertwined – and Putin, of course, will watch Russia’s athletes competing in their third consecutive Olympics without their flag and national anthem.",Sport/Sport,Winter Olympics: surreal turns into the familiar for British curlers in Beijing,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/02/britains-curlers-bruce-mouat-and-jennifer-dodds-begin-games-with-win

The list of crimes proven against officers in recent years is as shocking as it is long, ranging from an apparent endemic culture of racism, misogyny, homophobia and bullying, to corruption, rape and murder. It is time to strip back the Met from its bloated and pernicious condition, and reform it with new leadership, a new name and a remit to engage with the diverse communities that it claims to serve, not just the white middle classes and the establishment. It is a failing organisation with an annual budget approaching £4bn, much of which could be better spent in regenerating the deprived and marginalised communities that the Met has played a part in stigmatising.  Increasing police budgets has not led to a reduction in crime. It is time to divert the money to social and infrastructure investments, which would make a real difference to communities.

2/3/2022,"Twenty years on, after innumerable TV series and spin-offs, lawsuits and movie franchise iterations the Jackass crew is back with yet another festival of fantastically pointless and immature bad taste, including a new younger generation of Jackass stuntsters who tell the camera they can’t believe they’re on the show they grew up with. The last film was Jackass 3D in 2010, part of the 3D craze in cinema which has now been quietly abandoned without anyone noticing or caring. But Jackass marches on. As ever, the guys are taking turns doing stupid and dangerous things, while the rest of the gang scream with supportive, incredulous laughter and the participants scream with laughter right back at them once the stunt is over. In fact, the real Jackass gonzo discipline would seem to be keeping up the grinning party mood even after a heavyweight boxer has hit you in the balls. Are there any cutting-room-floor-moments when any of them seriously lost their sense of humour?  The gang are getting attacked by bees, bears, bulls. One woman gets a “scorpion botox”: the creature stings her on the lips. Jackass leader Johnny Knoxville is fired into the air wearing feathery wings in homage to the Icarus myth. It hardly needs saying that the Jackass identity is overwhelmingly male – but what also needs saying is that the movies are unique in popular culture in actually showing the penis: that part of the male body that is fastidiously avoided in even the most avowedly explicit films. In Jackass Forever, the penis is shown repeatedly, explicitly and in a way that’s weirdly the opposite of macho. Its vulnerability and absurdity is what comes across in Jackass. It’s like an exotic, strange creature, a victim-version of the menacing creatures in the film – like the huge spider that in one very ingenious game is set up in a plastic tube interconnecting two plastic helmets in which two players’ heads are enclosed. Each has to blow the spider at the other and the loser, having let the spider into his helmet, has to let the spider bite him. “This isn’t a Mensa convention!” says one player. Is that disingenuous? Isn’t there, in fact, some advanced showbiz intelligence and surrealist savvy in the way Jackass is set up and edited? Either way, it has a horror-comedy impact.  Jackass Forever is released on 4 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Jackass Forever review – unstoppable comedy stunt show still has a sting in its tail,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/jackass-forever-review-unstoppable-comedy-stunt-show-still-has-a-sting-in-its-tail
2/3/2022,"Donald Trump will charge top-paying guests $250,000 to attend a “Take Back Congress Candidate Forum” at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this month – with proceeds going to his own Super Pac, rather than Republicans who will actually try to take back Congress. Nor is the top price tag, which guarantees a private dinner and picture with Trump as well as VIP seating at the forum, necessarily the full cost for any couple who chooses to pay it. On Twitter on Wednesday, the New York Times reporter and Trump watcher Maggie Haberman said: “$250k lets you pay for a Mar-a-Lago guest room.”  Further down the menu, a couple paying $100,000 will get a photo with Trump and seating at a private dinner with endorsed candidates, with comments from Trump. For $50,000, guests will get the dinner and the Trump comments, but a picture only with “endorsed candidates”. Price tags descend to $5,000 per couple, for attendance – but presumably less than primo seating – at the dinner with comments from Trump. Emphasising Trump’s grip on the Republican party, Haberman pointed out that the former president “is spending almost no money on other Republicans so far. But he’s trying to raise for his group using congressional Republicans.” The Mar-a-Lago event is notionally aimed at the midterm elections in November this year, when Republicans are favoured to take back the House and possibly the Senate. A House takeover would see Trump well positioned to dictate to loyalists in party leadership, under Kevin McCarthy, the current minority leader. They are expected to pursue aggressive investigations of the Biden administration including a revenge impeachment and even, should the former speaker and McCarthy adviser Newt Gingrich be believed, the attempted jailing of members of the committee currently investigating the January 6 insurrection. Trump has his eyes on the 2024 presidential election, when he has strongly hinted he will run for the White House again. At a rally in Texas last week, he promised to pardon January 6 rioters and urged supporters to stage huge protests against prosecutors in New York and Georgia investigating his business affairs and election subversion. Trump has amassed a huge campaign war chest, of $122m. In a statement this week, spokesman Taylor Budowuch said the former president had “built a political organisation that continues to capture and define the future of the Republican party. “There is no question that the Make America Great Again (Maga!) wave is set to crash across the midterms and carry forward all the way through 2024.” But Trump’s leadership committee, Save America, this week declared donations of just $205,000 to endorsed candidates in the second half of 2021 – $45,000 less than the tag for a top-priced ticket to the dinner and forum at Mar-a-Lago on 23 February (not including guest room). CNN also reported that Trump’s Make America Great Again, Again! committee has spent around $1.7m on legal expenses as Trump fights investigations and congressional oversight. It has been widely reported that the Republican National Committee has helped to pay Trump’s legal bills. Trump’s Super Pac includes among its officers Pam Bondi, a former attorney general of Florida to whom Trump once controversially donated; the former ambassador to Germany and controversial former acting director of national intelligence Ric Grenell; and Matt Whitaker, briefly and controversially acting attorney general in the Trump administration.

2/3/2022,"CNN chair Jeff Zucker, one of the US’s most powerful media executives, resigned on Wednesday following the disclosure that he was having a relationship with another senior executive at the news organization. In a memo to staff obtained by the New York Times, Zucker said he was in a consensual relationship with his “closest colleague” and had failed to disclose it, as required by company policy.  The colleague is Allison Gollust, CNN’s executive vice-president and chief marketing officer. Gollust and Zucker have worked together for 20 years. The relationship came to light during the network’s investigation into the conduct of Chris Cuomo, the CNN anchor fired for trying to help his brother, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, fight accusations of sexual misconduct. “As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years,” Zucker wrote. “I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong.” Zucker, 56, also stepped down as chair of WarnerMedia’s news and sports division. In a statement obtained by the Times, Gollust said she was remaining in her role at CNN. She said: “Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years. Recently, our relationship changed during Covid. I regret that we didn’t disclose it at the right time. I’m incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do every day.” Both Zucker and Gollust are divorced. Zucker stood by Cuomo, then one of CNN’s biggest stars, for months amid revelations that the anchor was advising aides to his brother on how to fend off sexual misconduct allegations that led to the governor’s resignation last August. The former president and CEO of NBCUniversal, Zucker has long been one of the dominant executives in US media. He launched the media careers of Donald Trump on The Apprentice and Joe Rogan on Fear Factor. He joined CNN in 2013 and soon found himself at odds with Trump over CNN’s coverage of the former president, who labeled CNN an “enemy of the people”. Zucker had been expected to step down from CNN in the coming month after CNN’s parent company, US telecoms company AT&T, completes the spinoff of its WarnerMedia media assets into a separate business in combination with Discovery.

2/3/2022,"Michael Gove has announced the government’s plan for levelling up, with a focus on devolution, transport, education and raising the pay and productivity of towns and cities outside London and the south-east. It follows decades of attempts by successive governments to spread prosperity across the country, most recently with George Osborne’s northern powerhouse plan and Theresa May’s industrial strategy.  The focus on living standards has been welcomed, but it comes after a decade of austerity that has made the task harder, and much more needs to be done. “The lack of new funding announced today, and an approach to devolution that appears to be quite centrally controlled, suggest more needs to be done before the reality of these plans meets the rhetoric,” said Katie Schmuecker, deputy director of policy & partnerships at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation poverty charity. At Rishi Sunak’s spending review in October the chancellor announced an expansion in government funding to end austerity. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said many areas would still have funding lower than in 2010 by 2025, despite a steady rise in pressures for public spending from an ageing population and the climate challenge to hit net zero. Local authority funding, regarded as a key mechanism for levelling up, has been cut particularly hard. Central government grants – including retained business rates – have been reduced 37% in real-terms over the decade to 2020, an effective cut worth £15bn in real terms, according to the Institute for Government. Britain’s poorest local authorities have been hit hardest. Salford has suffered the deepest cuts in the UK, with a 48% reduction since 2010 according to the Centre for Progressive Policy. “Red wall” areas such as Wigan, Gateshead and Rochdale are also in the top 10 for cuts, with budget reductions of more than a third. Poor regions that benefited from EU funding – such as Cornwall, Wales and north-east England – are likely to get less after Brexit, despite Boris Johnson promising to match support allocated by Brussels. The commons Treasury committee warned last week the UK’s post-Brexit “shared prosperity fund” is worth 40% less, with an average annual budget worth £1.5bn compared with £2.5bn from the EU. Gove has set out targets for pay, employment and productivity rises in every part of the UK by 2030, with the gap between top and bottom places narrowing. It will require making a start at fixing among the worst productivity gaps in Europe, with regional differences the worst since 1901. It’s a long-running issue, stretching back at least to deindustrialisation in the 1980s and 1990s. It’s also a task which comes amid the cost of living crisis, with workers’ pay expected to fall in real terms in 2021 due to inflation hitting the highest rates in three decades. Real average weekly earnings across the UK remain below the peak recorded in February 2008, in the worst period for wage growth since the Napoleonic wars. The IFS has warned real wages are unlikely to rise significantly by the middle of the decade, leaving the average worker £13,000 worse off than under pre-2008 financial crisis pay growth trends. Narrowing regional gaps will be hard. The thinktank said workers in London were paid £20 an hour on average, more than 60% higher than £13 an hour in Scarborough and Grimsby – although the differences at the top end are starkest. While wages are similar across regions for the poorest 10% in Britain, the top 10th of earners in the capital get 80% more an hour than the top 10th in Scarborough. Cuts to benefits will make the task harder. Poorer areas have higher proportions of benefit claimants. Analysts warned when the government cut universal credit by £20 a week in October that “red wall” constituencies would be hardest hit. Inequality has actually widened since Johnson’s 2019 election victory. According to the New Economics Foundation, the poorest 50% of families in Britain are on average £110 a year worse off in real terms, while the richest 5% are £3,300 a year richer between December 2019 and December 2021. Levelling up targets include increasing educational attainment, skills and training. However, it follows an unprecedented period for cuts in the education budget. According to the IFS, per pupil spending in schools will have returned to 2010 levels by 2024, highlighting “a remarkable lack of priority afforded to the education system since 2010.” The thinktank said the extent to which schools’ funding is targeted at schools with the most deprived pupils has declined since the early 2010s. Since 2013, the average funding per pupil for the fifth of schools with the highest levels of deprivation has dropped from 35% higher than for the fifth with the lowest levels of deprivation, to 23% higher in 2019. Despite the levelling up plan, the Learning and Work Institute estimates that skills investment will still be £750m lower in 2025 than in 2010. Stephen Evans, the thinktank’s chief executive, said: “To truly ‘level up’ demands better investment, greater local control and long-term commitment. Unfortunately, the education and skills plans fall short.” The plan includes a mission to narrow gaps in healthy life expectancy between local areas and increase it nationally by five years by 2035 replicates a target set by Theresa May in 2018 under her industrial strategy. Over the past decade, however, the gap in the number of years a person can expect to live a healthy life has widened to become as large as that between the UK and Sudan, according to the Centre for Progressive Policy. Reflecting rising inequality between rich and poor areas, people in Blaenau Gwent in south Wales can expect up to 16.4 fewer years of good health than those in Wokingham in Berkshire. Jo Bibby, director of health at the Health Foundation, said the ambition of the government plan was welcome, but that several of the worst places in the UK for healthy life expectancy would be outside expanded mayoral authorities. Before Covid-19, the health policy thinktank calculated it would take 75 years on current trends to improve UK healthy life expectancy by five years. “It appears the government has failed to grasp the enormity of the challenge. The regeneration schemes are too narrowly focused to address the entrenched inequalities in left behind areas,” Bibby said.",News/Inequality,Can Britain be levelled up?

2/3/2022,"Late-night hosts continued to check in on the House’s slowly evolving investigation into the January 6 insurrection, including a report that many of the official documents handed over by the National Archives had been ripped up by Donald Trump.  “The National Archives didn’t explain how they know they were ripped up by Trump,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday evening. “My guess is tiny little barbecue sauce fingerprints.” It’s not surprising, given that Trump’s habit for ripping up official documents has been well publicized. “He was under the impression that the documents couldn’t be put back together because his son Eric ate all the glue at the White House,” Kimmel quipped. The documents are intact, however, thanks to National Archives employees who have taped the papers back together. “I love that Robert Mueller couldn’t get him but Trump might finally get brought down by a roll of Scotch tape,” Kimmel joked. Tuesday 1 February, marked the first day of Black History Month – “for Americans, this is a time to celebrate the black experience and black contributions to our country,” noted Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. “And for corporate brands, it’s a time to suggest that Langston Hughes would’ve enjoyed the new Wendy’s Double Baconator.” In other, more ominous news, the House committee on the January 6 attack on the Capitol received evidence that Trump, in the weeks after the 2020 election, personally directed his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to ask the Department of Homeland Security if it could seize voting machines in swing states. “Let’s be clear: it is difficult, after years of building a thick, protective callous over my heart and my brain just to protect myself from the hot black tar of his narcissistic, evil impulses, for me to take this information in, for the gargantuan and grotesque violation of everything this country holds dear,” said Colbert of the information, first reported by the New York Times. “But I think it’s worth taking a moment right now just to let this sink in. Just to marinate in his madness,” he continued. “Because the former president – still the leader of one of the two major parties, who has all the Republican balls in a little velvet pouch that he wears around his neck like an amulet – wanted troops, US troops, to go into your local polling place, grab the machines, throw them in a truck, and then God knows what? Waterboard them until they he won? “You should be alarmed, even if you voted for him, because military coups do not lead to healthy societies,” he concluded. “Nobody ever says, ‘if only we could emulate the economic miracle that is Myanmar.’” Tom Brady’s calling it quits, but a big question remains: what will become of Gronk? pic.twitter.com/06oVxwnTPw And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah celebrated the retirement of the NFL great Tom Brady at the age of 44, after 22 seasons and seven Super Bowls. “Whether you loved him or hated him, you have to admire Tom Brady’s journey,” Noah said. “I mean, when this dude started his career, he was picked almost dead last in the draft. And yet he ended up dominating the game for 20 years. Which is an important lesson for all the little kids out there who might be coming in last. “And that lesson is: this probably won’t happen for you. See, this was only going to happen one time, and Tom Brady took it, I’m sorry.” The retirement isn’t surprising, Noah continued, as press swirled around unofficial reports that Brady would hang up his cleats for days. “What is surprising is that at 44 years old this guy was still dominating the NFL! Think about it: the NFL, where people car accident each other for a living. And this guy was doing that in his 40s. Most people I know in his 40s are like, ‘ah, my back hurts, I think I slept too long.’” Brady’s retirement raises the question: is he the best quarterback of all time? “Some people say yes, because he holds all the records and won the most Super Bowls,” Noah answered. “Other people say ‘no, because he didn’t do that to my team!’”",Arts/Culture,Kimmel on Trump ripping up records: ‘He might get brought down by a roll of Scotch tape’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/02/jimmy-kimmel-late-night-hosts-trump
2/3/2022,"The longer a policy paper, the more likely it is that it’s full of waffle. In the case of the so-called “levelling up” white paper, I don’t doubt, for a minute, the sincerity of Michael Gove, who for a long time has been interested in social mobility and is, from his own political standpoint, genuinely trying to open up opportunity. But when you’re in a cabinet and government that holds, as its central tenet of philosophy, that it’s no business of government and the state to provide the framework for greater equality, the chances of success are zilch.  Leaving aside that much of the funding is already announced, and the rest unclear, and concentrating on the few new measures proposed, there is little that will genuinely make a difference in “levelling up” the country. The 12 national ambitions to be achieved by 2030 don’t even begin to address the intergenerational challenges and the damage caused by austerity cuts since 2010. The scope of the missions range from transport to local pride, but only two focus on transforming the lives of individuals through education. New bus routes, home ownership and spruced-up streets are important, but unless people’s lives are changed, the physical environment will begin to deteriorate once again. The white paper recommends a “significant” increase in primary school children reaching expected standards in reading, writing and maths. We know from the report of Sir Kevan Collins, who was appointed by the government to develop plans for post-Covid recovery in the education system, that vast sums of money are needed to reverse the emergence of a divide in outcomes. But, instead of £15bn over five years, which would have made the difference, the government allocated £1.4bn. The much-vaunted national tutoring programme got off to a stumbling, but relatively solid, start. However, it was effectively halted by the government as it tendered the contract for the second part of the programme to the cheapest provider. It would appear that from September, only 15% of the agreed take-up had actually been achieved. What is needed now is a return to clearly targeted funding for the most disadvantaged children, extending the pupil premium and adopting Collins’ recommendations in full. Education doesn’t stopat school-leaving age, and the report sets the goal of a “significant” rise in the numbers completing high-quality skills training across the UK. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, there has been a 50% fall in spending since 2010 on adult education. Despite the government’s rhetoric on investment in skills, it will not be until 2025 that its “guarantee” of training will kick in. The funding pot for skills from the Departments for Work and Pensions, and which has already been announced, is often aimed at attempting to fill the jobs left by the million-plus migrants who have returned home, with little emphasis on planning for the future workforce, the digital revolution or climate change. Universities are a key driving force for economic and social renewal across the country. For young and old alike, these anchor institutions, and the knowledge transfer made possible by them, can be transformational in the most deprived communities, and areas previously reliant on heavy industry. But there is nothing in the missions to improve their lot. In fact, government policy is actively undermining universities in the north of England. The Office for Students has been asked to mark down universities if their cohorts do not move into “skilled work” after graduation, something less available in areas outside of the south due to regional inequality. This means northern students attending university nearer home will be tempted to leave their areas for well-paid jobs elsewhere. To help make regeneration a reality, contradictions in government policy must be set aside. To mislead people into believing that you are doing something transformational when you have no intention of committing the resources or policies to make that possible is to create greater mistrust and disillusionment. Promises of levelling up may temporarily help some Conservative MPs hold on to their seats, but at the long-term price of undermining confidence in the democratic process.

2/3/2022,"A majority of voters oppose a key plank of the Coalition’s religious discrimination bill that would allow discriminatory speech and say they want greater protections for LGBTQ+ students and teachers, a new poll suggests. The YouGov Galaxy poll of 1,030 voters, conducted for lobby group Just Equal, suggests the public doesn’t back the bill which some government MPs oppose due to the potential impact on marginalised students.  The poll comes after Citipointe Christian College urged families to sign an enrolment contract that included asking them to agree “homosexual acts” were immoral. That controversy caused Labor and Liberal moderate MPs to warn against waving the bill through federal parliament when it resumes on Tuesday. The poll suggests 77% of voters oppose the “statements of belief” clause that would mean statements grounded in religious belief do not breach discrimination laws banning speech that humiliated, intimidated, insulted or ridiculed people based on protected attributes. Some 64% of those polled said it should be against the law for religious schools to expel or refuse to enrol students who were bisexual, gay, lesbian or transgender, including children of same-sex couples; while 62% said the same of dismissing a teacher for their sexuality. Opposition to allowing harmful speech in the name of religion was higher among Labor voters (81%) as was support for prohibiting schools from discriminating in enrolment (75%). On Friday, two parliamentary inquiries into the religious discrimination bill are due to report before a short parliamentary sitting in which Labor support would probably be required to pass the proposed legislation. In both committees, the Coalition and Labor are collaborating with the aim of writing a joint report, but Labor could go further in expressing significant concerns about the statements of belief clause and expanded hiring and firing powers over teachers. The Greens oppose the bill. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But even with in-principle support from the committees, which are chaired by Liberal senator Sarah Henderson and National MP Anne Webster, the government would still need to force a vote on a bill that has become extremely contentious in its own ranks. Labor’s holding position, adopted by caucus in November, is that the government must “deliver on its three-year-old commitment to protect LGBT students from discrimination”, suggesting it may make amendments. But Labor could delay a final verdict until the government has responded to the committees’ reports in the hope that divisions on the Coalition side grow. Three Liberal MPs have reserved their position and a further four – Angie Bell, Katie Allen, Fiona Martin, and Dave Sharma – have called for LGBTQ+ students to be protected from being expelled in the same package as the religious discrimination bill. In answers to the committees’ questions on notice, the attorney general’s department revealed it did work on drafting to remove the provision from the Sex Discrimination Act that allows gay students to be expelled, which would implement Michaelia Cash’s purported deal with Bell and the other MPs. But in December, Cash appeared to renege on that by saying protections for students would have to wait at least 12 months for a separate review process. Allen also commissioned work from academic Liam Elphick about how the statements of belief clause, if retained, could be softened by ensuring it no longer overrides state discrimination laws. Opponents say the case for the religious discrimination bill has been weakened by one of Queensland’s largest independent schools asking families to sign an enrolment contract that includes asking them to agree “homosexual acts” are immoral, listing them along with bestiality, incest and paedophilia as “offensive to God”. The “statement of faith” required for enrolment at Citipointe Christian College also includes statements that imply transgender students will be recognised only by their “biological sex” at the school – that students should identify “with the gender that God bestowed”. Labor MP Graham Perrett, the deputy chair of the human rights committee considering the bill, told Guardian Australia that contract “might focus the mind of all 227 politicians about what this bill might mean for multi-faith and multicultural communities”. Perrett noted that every state and territory except New South Wales and South Australia already had some form of protection against religious discrimination, but the case of Citipointe “will certainly focus the mind about this legislation the prime minister personally introduced”. Allen said her support for the religious discrimination bill was “conditional on protection of gay and trans students’ rights” and removing the section of the SDA allowing their expulsion would be “critical to that support”. “The Brisbane school [Citipointe Christian College] highlights how problematic statements of belief can be,” she told Guardian Australia. Bell said Citipointe’s decision demonstrated that “for many years, religious schools have preserved the ability to terminate a child’s enrolment based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy”. Bell said she would continue to negotiate to ensure children were treated on merit not sexual or gender identity. “A child should be able to attend any Australian education institution without hindrance or judgment,” she said, urging Citipointe college to “focus on the education of children and fostering a positive environment, where every child feels safe”. A spokesperson for Just Equal Australia, Brian Greig, said the Morrison government “must reassess its ideological push for this divisive bill and the opposition must recognise the strong objections to this bill from Labor voters”. “Australians do not support special privileges for religious people to be exempt from anti-discrimination laws,” he said. “Nor do they support a bill that allows people to discriminate against others in the name of faith.” Greig said the bill must not be rushed through parliament in the “chaotic environment” of the last few sitting days before the election. “This bill must be withdrawn and rewritten to remove its unwanted, harmful content.”",News/Australia news,"Majority of voters reject Coalition’s proposal to allow discrimination on basis of religious belief, poll suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/majority-of-voters-reject-coalitions-proposal-to-allow-discrimination-on-basis-of-religious-belief-poll-suggests

2/3/2022,"Aged care providers estimate about a quarter of all shifts – or the equivalent of 140,000 shifts a week – are going unfilled, while the disability sector has reported roster vacancies of up to 30% during the peak of Omicron. The ongoing staff shortages – which the government this week sought to address with $400 retention payments – have sparked widespread calls for the government to do more for both the stretched aged care and disability care workforce.  The disability sector, whose carers are not eligible for the government payment, says its carers will miss out on the bonus despite doing equivalent work to that in aged care under similarly stressed conditions. Workers for large home care providers who look after people in both aged care and disability will also be financially penalised for their NDIS clients, with one organisation estimating that up to 40% of its staff will receive no bonus at all. Both the disability and aged care sectors are struggling with workforce shortages, with the National Disability Services chief executive, Laurie Leigh, telling Guardian Australia that up to 30% of shifts could not be filled in the first two weeks of January as the Omicron wave peaked. “When you are getting up past sort of 20% or so of your workforce absent on any one day, that is extreme, and it means that providers are having to make difficult decisions about what shifts they can fill and what essential services have to be done,” Leigh said. “That’s put a lot of pressure on both individual workers in terms of the extra hours that they’ve been putting in, and on providers in terms of some of the costs around extra overtime and agency staff.” Leigh said the $400 bonus payments to aged care workers “did not scratch the surface” of what was needed in that sector, but disability care workers would receive nothing at all. “Looking at it from a disability sector, it’s a workforce that does very similar work in terms of supporting vulnerable people, it is a workforce that has been working as hard through the same sort of conditions that the aged care workforce has, but it’s a workforce that we don’t see having the same sort of recognition,” she said. “It’s the sense that, once again, the disability sector has kind of come in second to the aged care sector and that there’s more recognition in that sector of the needs than there is for even the start of a conversation in the disability sector.” Stuart Miller from myHomecare Group, which represents about 10 providers servicing more than 20,000 people in residential care, said that while he welcomed the retention bonus, it did not do anything to address structural issues in the sector. “It is a sugar rush because it is all about retention, it’s not about actually giving these people what they deserve. I will take that help, but it doesn’t fix things structurally,” Miller told Guardian Australia. He also said that up to 40% of his staff may not receive the payment, with carers having a combination of home care clients whose services may not be covered by the eligible programs and being financially penalised as a result. “In our organisation, as the largest provider, I’ve got people who work for veterans, I’ve got people who work for disability, or people who work for workers’ compensation and they’re not entitled to it (the payment) because it’s not federally funded,” he said. “There’s people in the office who are care managers who aren’t necessarily giving direct contact care, but are talking to our clients and managing their care, but those people aren’t necessarily going to be eligible either.” He also said providers were being burdened with the additional paperwork to administer the scheme, needing to calculate how many hours of care a worker had undertaken with certain clients to qualify for the payments. “I want to make sure our staff get everything they’re entitled to on this, but it won’t quite be what everyone thinks it will be. This is more spin than anything else.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The concern about the payments from the disability sector has also been raised by aged care providers, who say many workers will be excluded from the retention bonus program, including reception, lifestyle and maintenance staff, and all those employed for the Commonwealth Home Support Program. “It is definitely unfair when these people are providing services to people in very similar conditions,” the chief executive of Aged & Community Services Australia, Paul Sadler, said. Sadler said that provider surveys had revealed staff shortages of between 15% and 50% since the Omicron wave hit, with the 25% average figure to be released in a situation report for the sector on Tuesday. “This has been at a level unprecedented,” Sadler said. “From our point of view it’s absolutely a crisis in aged care, and we have been calling for urgent help from the government, including from the Australian Defence Force, and from whatever other sources we can to provide support.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The situation report says that while the government had been able to provide some support with a “surge” workforce of about 1,000 shifts a week, the scale was “clearly insufficient” to meet demand. “This seems unlikely to be resolved in the near future,” the report says. “Government has been working for several weeks on avenues to fill staffing shortages, including volunteers, private hospital staff, and retired and student nurses. “Unfortunately, there is no sign of a surge workforce that might approach the scale needed to address the current crisis. We ask families and clients for their support during this difficult time. Staff and providers are doing absolutely everything they can with the resources they have available.” The report says the sector had been advised that the idea of using the military for support “has been explored as an option but is not considered viable”. The latest figures from the Department of Health showed there were 23,900 active Covid cases within the aged care system across 1,261 residential aged care facilities. That included more than 14,000 staff and close to 9,000 residents. In January alone, 499 aged care residents died from Covid – more than the total number of aged care residents who passed away in 2021.",News/Australia news,‘Absolutely a crisis’: almost a quarter of Australia’s aged care shifts unfilled each week,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/absolutely-a-crisis-almost-a-quarter-of-australias-aged-care-shifts-unfilled-each-week
2/3/2022,"Amnesty International has called on the Australian government to unequivocally condemn “crimes against humanity” after the prime minister dismissed the group’s assessment that Israel is perpetrating apartheid against Palestinians. Scott Morrison told reporters “no country is perfect”, in response to Amnesty’s 280-page report on Israel. A spokesperson for the foreign minister, Marise Payne, told Guardian Australia: “We do not agree with the report’s characterisations of Israel, and we remain a firm supporter of the state of Israel.”  The Labor opposition also said the use of the term apartheid was “not helpful” – but it described Amnesty’s detailed report as “concerning” and urged the government to “stand up for human rights everywhere”. Amnesty International said it had concluded that Israel had “perpetrated the international wrong of apartheid, as a human rights violation and a violation of public international law”. The London-based human rights organisation said it had “demonstrated that Israel has imposed a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians wherever it exercises control over the enjoyment of their rights – across Israel and the OPT [Occupied Palestinian Territories] and with regard to Palestinian refugees”. Israel’s government swiftly dismissed the report, saying the findings were “divorced from reality”. It also accused Amnesty of antisemitism. When asked directly about the report’s findings, and whether his government would condemn Israel over the matter, Morrison said Australia – together with the US – had been among “the closest and strongest friends of Israel”. “No country is perfect. There are criticisms made of all countries, but I can assure you that Australia and my government, in particular, will remain a staunch friend of Israel,” Morrison said. Nikita White, a campaigner with Amnesty International Australia, said the prime minister’s response to the report was “particularly disappointing”. “While he’s right that no country is perfect, not all countries commit crimes against humanity, and when they do, Amnesty International believes that Australia has an obligation to condemn these crimes but also an obligation to act,” White said in an interview. “The prime minister needs to consider whether remaining a staunch friend will contribute to this system of apartheid and the suffering of Palestinians who are living under that system.” White said it was not good enough to raise concerns behind the scenes, because the Amnesty report “builds on a growing consensus that what Israel is doing amounts to apartheid”. Payne’s spokesperson said Australia was a strong supporter of a two-state solution “with Israel and a future Palestinian state establishing internationally recognised borders”. “The conflict between the Palestinians and Israel must be resolved so that peace and security can become normalised,” Payne’s spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We have always urged all parties to refrain from actions and statements that undermine the prospects for peace.” Greens senator Janet Rice, said she would be writing to Payne “to urge a response to Amnesty’s powerful report”. “The PM’s ‘no country is perfect’ is a feeble and absurd response,” Rice said. Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said the report’s findings were concerning. “We expect the government to review it closely, assess the situation on the ground, and make representations about Australia’s view,” Wong said. “Labor does not agree with the use of the term ‘apartheid’. It’s not a term that’s been found to apply by any international court and is not helpful in progressing the meaningful dialogue and negotiation necessary to achieve a just and enduring peace.” Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, had earlier rejected the report, saying: “Amnesty quotes lies spread by terrorist organisations.” “I hate to use the argument that if Israel were not a Jewish state, nobody in Amnesty would dare argue against it, but in this case, there is no other possibility,” Lapid said. Lapid said: “Israel is not perfect, but it is a democracy committed to international law and open to scrutiny, with a free press and strong supreme court.” White said the foreign minister’s response was “not unexpected” and said Amnesty International “stands against discrimination of any kind, including antisemitism”. She said Amnesty had “a long history of reporting on Hamas’s human rights abuses and the human rights abuses of several Palestinian armed groups and the Palestinian Authority as well”. The executive director of the Australian Centre for International Justice, Rawan Arraf, said Morrison “would benefit from looking up the crime of apartheid in our criminal code”. “It’s a serious criminal offence which Australia has an obligation to prevent and punish,” Arraf said. “Australia was also a strong supporter of the apartheid regime in South Africa, and it took a widespread movement of ordinary people, civil society and unions to come together and force change, this needs to happen again here.” Israel’s embassy in Canberra was contacted for comment, but directed Guardian Australia to the statement from the foreign minister.",News/Australia news,‘No country is perfect’: Morrison critical of Amnesty International report on Israel,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/no-country-is-perfect-morrison-critical-of-amnesty-international-report-on-israel
2/3/2022,"The Great British Bake Off, and all of its spin-offs around the world, are perhaps one of the strangest TV success stories. On paper, a bunch of amateur bakers competing in an extremely low-stakes reality competition, making the kinds of delicious treats you’d be fed by a delightful grandma, do not sound like the necessary ingredients for high octane television. Nevertheless, what we’re served is the most delightful cake, perfect television. Wholesome, funny, gently exciting – sometimes even inspirational and moving, Bake Off’s success comes down to the joy that the contestants hold for baking, and the show’s ability to share that joy with the audience.  No matter where you watch the show, it tends to follow a certain recipe when it comes to casting – and I think it’s time to break down the staples of a good season of Bake Off. And from what we’ve seen of the latest season of The Great Australian Bake Off, they’re adhering pretty closely to some of these classic tropes – with a few new ones thrown into the mix. Hark! Is that the sound of a very good boy who simply loves Christmas? One of the most bizarre and overwhelmingly wholesome Bake Off tropes is the number of boys who bake cakes themed around that most wonderful time of the year. The 2020 GBBO winner, Peter Sawkins, is perhaps the most recent example, famously using “Christmas flavours” and decorations on several of his bakes. (In Australia, our Christmas flavours are prawns, heatstroke, and repressed anger.) However, Sawkins does not celebrate Christmas through baking alone, with several bright eyed boys preceding him in various seasons. (We all loved Henry, didn’t we?) And there’s nothing wrong with a Christmas Boy; they’re terminally delightful. Despite a lifetime of experience, a stoic attitude forged through the pain of existence, and knowing more about baking than many people on this round Earth, many of the older women contestants are avatars of chaos and mishap in the Bake Off tent. This is often demonstrated through a somewhat elastic relationship with time, a cavalier attitude to measurements, and frequent run-ins with the concept of physics (if a cake starts to topple, a chaos grandma is often behind it). Think of wonderful Karen, or Maggie, or Diana of bingate. But the Grandmother Chaos type is usually oblivious to the drama she creates; she doesn’t live for the drama, she simply is it. She’s also usually a remarkable baker, pulling victory out of the jaws of anarchy week after week. Grandmother Chaos has also been young, and also not a woman before – yet they all retain the vibe of an elderly matriarch. Hey, there’s often some guy with a hat. Their baking is usually fine, they’re usually fine, but the main thing is that they’re wearing a hat inside. Sure, it’s a tent, so maybe it’s more of a liminal zone than a normal house, but it doesn’t stop the hat from sticking out. It’s a rarer trope than some of the others, but one of the most quickly identifiable: it’s a guy wearing a hat. This person went somewhere once – perhaps exotic, perhaps simply influential in a culinary way, and it blew their tiny brains, changed them in an irrevocable way. Remember all those hippy movies from the 70s where an uptight businessman does acid and then gives it all up for a life of free love on the road? This is kinda what happened to the traveller trope, except it’s more that they tried turmeric somewhere, and now all their baking is about recreating that one perfect moment of cuisine. Taking them back to the year they threw caution to the wind and bit into a “pineapple”. This contestant often is an actual engineer, or studying to be one, or in some kind of engineer adjacent field (bridge appreciation?): think Giuseppe who won the last season of GBBO. But sometimes the Engineer is a scientist, who seem to frequently turn up on Bake Offs – like Sunny, who won the last season of Australian Bake Off, or Haydn this season, or GBBO’s Jürgen the physicist. These contestants approach baking with the attitude of someone erecting a tall building: it’s precise, it’s considered, it’s often as much a work of logistics as it is pastry. The Engineer will usually go far, as they have a plan, and a knowledge of angles. To borrow a RuPaul’s Drag Race term, the “trade” of the season is the unexpected hottie, the absolutely gorgeous contestant. I’m not talking about merely handsome or beautiful – every Bake Off tent has been full of lovely looking people – I’m talking about a ridiculously sexy idiot who makes everyone go a bit weird, including the judges. Chigs in the last season of GBBO is the most recent example of this. You just don’t expect a person that sexy to be on a baking competition. Hot AND able to cook? Hopefully they’re also functionally illiterate, so they’re not literally perfect. Somehow, there’s always one baker who only started baking like six months ago. The aforementioned Chigs is one of these, but it’s a common trope. It’s a great story for the show, because it means they get to make a big deal about how far they’ve come along in such a short time. It’s also sometimes funny, because they’ll be told to “whip cream” and have a complete breakdown because they’ve never done it before. Also known as: the Baking Virgin. There’s always a literal child, a tiny baby, who often has the same vibe as the Prodigy – due to their extremely limited years on this Earth – but also sometimes they’re unspeakably awkward and wearing an odd combination of clothes. They are often adopted by other contestants. One of the best parts of the British version is the very personable host, Noel Fielding, and the fun that he has with the contestants. Once every blue moon, he will find a kindred spirit, someone who he genuinely seems to love, and who will often end up baking cakes for Noel’s children.

2/3/2022,"Ventilation audits in schools across New South Wales have come under fresh scrutiny after two reviews of the same Blue Mountains school weeks apart resulted in the student capacity of one classroom rising by 500%. The government announced last year it would conduct ventilation audits at the 2,200 public schools across NSW to ensure there was enough fresh air inside classrooms, libraries and halls to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  But as schools return for 2022 amid high community transmission of the Omicron variant in the state, new questions are being asked about the audits. The Guardian obtained copies of two audits conducted for the same school, which came to dramatically different conclusions about student capacity. In one example, a 55.4 sq metre “teaching space” was originally classified as having capacity for 25 students. But a second audit conducted less than three weeks later found that 154 students could safely occupy the room. In another case, a slightly larger room went from a capacity of 26 students to 77. In a third, the school’s bay was changed from a capacity of six to 19. In another, the result went the other direction; a classroom designated as being safe for 77 students was downgraded to 39. The department did not respond to questions about specific schools, but said they “worked with schools and provided guidance on how spaces should be used relative to the availability of natural ventilation”. “In many cases, this resulted in updated information on reports which were reissued to schools.” The Guardian understands the second audit was based on an in-person inspection of the school and the individual characteristics of the teaching spaces, while the first was an indicative measurement based on the room’s size in square metres. But experts have questioned how the audits could have come to such dramatically different conclusions. Lidia Morawska, director of the International Laboratory of Air Quality and Health at the Queensland University of Technology, said the audit for the school was based on calculations that resulted in classroom capacity below 1 sq metre per person. “If the space per person is less than 1 sq metre people would be touching each other like sardines so at this close distance ventilation does not help much,” she said. “It is a very big concern if people could be at such a close proximity to each other – then they are at a very high risk of inhaling high concentration of particles emitted, and if the particles contain the virus then getting infected.” Morawska also questioned the widespread use of air conditioning in schools with windows that do not open. Dubbed “sealed schools”, there are 48 of them across the state. The department has said that air conditioning has been installed in all “sealed schools”, and the Guardian has seen correspondence from one principal that states the units will be kept running at all times. But with no carbon dioxide monitoring, Morawska said the plan for classroom ventilation remained unclear regardless of the use of air conditioners. “I’m amazed that they pretend they are doing something,” she said. Despite NSW and Victoria working closely together to develop a return to school plan, the two jurisdictions had different approaches for school ventilation audits. Geoff Hanmer, a professor of architecture at the University of Adelaide and the chair of OzSage’s ventilation group, said Victoria’s approach was “not perfect” but “driven by more science” compared with NSW’s because it involved CO2 monitoring. “If you want classrooms to be safe then you need to check ventilation, which means measuring using a CO2 monitor,” he said. “If people get this wrong the consequences are quite serious. There’s been a tendency to want to believe that schools are not a place where Covid spreads despite all the evidence to the contrary.” NSW is currently conducting a pilot program using CO2 monitors in some public schools across metropolitan, regional and NSW but the approach is not widespread. In Victoria, the state government gathered data from a range of ventilation assessments across 100 schools that comprised a representative sample of different building types, including the use of CO2 monitors, to determine ventilation. After the audit, the state government delivered 51,000 air purifiers to schools on a needs basis. NSW Labor’s shadow education minister, Pru Carr, said the government had “provided no proof that they actually know whether ventilation in schools is sufficient”. “Education Minister Sarah Mitchell and School Infrastructure NSW gave school communities assurances that the ventilation audit undertaken was comprehensive. It’s unclear then why significant changes to some room capacities were made and reports altered,” she said. “For schools without openable windows, there are also concerns that air-conditioning systems now being used are not filtered to prevent COVID-19 from spreading.” A department spokesperson said its ventilation and “asset use” was informed by NSW Health advice, research from the Doherty Institute, guidelines from the World Health Organisation and independent, peer-reviewed advice from building services consultants Steensen Varming. “The ventilation guidelines from the World Health Organisation for Delta are appropriate for the Omicron variant,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,‘Like sardines’: experts question the results of ventilation audits at NSW schools,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/like-sardines-experts-question-the-results-of-ventilation-audits-at-nsw-schools
2/3/2022,"Rapid antigen surveillance testing in schools should remain in place beyond the initial one-month period but could be then used in a more localised way, according to epidemiologists. In Victoria and New South Wales, where the school year commenced this week, governments are urging primary and secondary school students and staff to use at-home rapid antigen tests twice a week for the first four weeks of term in an effort to slow the spread of Covid.  With the number of active Covid infections dropping nationally, parents and students alike may be hoping for a reprieve from the process after four weeks. But the head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health, Prof Nancy Baxter, said if surveillance screening was successful in detecting Covid infections it should be in place for longer than four weeks regardless of whether Australia had passed the peak of Omicron cases. “One of the challenges is we will see high case numbers for a considerable period of time, so four weeks may be a good time to re-evaluate but it’s not going to be the time to stop,” she said. “We can expect a lot of transmission in schools but it’s going to be even higher if we start loosening restrictions.” The chair in epidemiology at Deakin University, Prof Catherine Bennett, said as the Omicron wave moved beyond its peak, surveillance screening at workplaces and educational institutions would gradually become less useful. “As incidence goes down in the population these tests become less useful as an active screen of asymptomatic people which is why we didn’t use them during Delta,” she said. “So you run the risk of having false positives and wasting a lot of tests without finding any cases or finding as many false positives as true positives.” But she said rapid antigen tests could be in place for longer than the initial one-month period in localised settings. “Say there’s a regional centre like Bendigo and suddenly they see lots of cases in the community, you might have that [rapid antigen surveillance screening] in the Bendigo schools. “They’re going to learn a lot this month about how many kids who test positive and then go and have a PCR come back negative and how many cases they are picking up. This is the big test week because kids are coming out of the community, haven’t been tested and we’re finding kids who are positive and took Covid to school unknowingly.” Under South Australia’s guidelines, close contacts need to undergo a rapid antigen test every day for seven days and can attend school if they return a negative result. Prof Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist at the University of South Australia, said a “test-to-stay” approach or surveillance testing could limit outbreaks in schools. “Anything we can do to reduce transmission is a good thing,” he said. “I can’t see the reasoning for only doing it for four weeks. It makes sense to do it on a permanent basis.” Victoria’s deputy premier and education minister, James Merlino, said the rapid antigen testing would help minimise disruptions from staff absences to ensure children could remain at school. Guardian Australia understands the Victorian government has not ruled out extending the surveillance testing measure if it is successful at detecting infections, subject to potential supply constraints. In NSW, the state government will review the strategy after two weeks.

But executive director of advocacy group The Parenthood, Georgie Dent, said most families were happy to participate in the process. “I know the surveillance screening isn’t perfect as parents and children doing it themselves is not as accurate as a trained nurse,” she said. “But parents and children are fairly comfortable with this uncomfortable reality.” ",News/Australia news,"Australia’s schools should continue Covid testing students indefinitely, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/schools-should-continue-covid-testing-of-students-indefinitely-expert-says
2/3/2022,"Consumer advocates have accused the Morrison government of failing to fulfil a key recommendation of the banking royal commission after the Coalition proposed a review of financial advice that wouldn’t examine commissions paid to agents who sell junk insurance. In a submission to Treasury, the Consumer Action Law Centre (Calc) said the draft terms of reference of the review should be scrapped and re-written to explicitly include insurance commissions, which Kenneth Hayne – the retired judge who headed the royal commission – said were difficult to justify.  The royal commission heard evidence that commissions were harming consumers. Pastor Grant Stewart gave evidence in 2018 that his son, who has Down’s syndrome and difficulty understanding whether things were cheap or expensive, bought funeral, accidental death and accidental injury insurance sold to him over the phone by a company called Freedom Insurance, which then refused to cancel the policies. The commission heard Freedom’s sales agents were incentivised through commissions and prizes including a “boat party” and a trip to Bali – which the company admitted encouraged aggressive and inappropriate sales. The company no longer sells insurance. Junk insurance has also been targeted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which in 2020 said it had secured $160m in remediation for consumers who bought useless products. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Thursday’s submission, Calc said that although the Treasury review’s draft terms of reference claimed to be consistent with Hayne’s recommendations, it could not “be said to be meaningfully implementing these recommendations without considering commissioner Hayne’s commentary on the conflicts between interest and duty in financial services”. “These findings, and the evidence at the royal commission of atrocious sales behaviour motivated by commissions and incentives, appear to have been forgotten in the drafting of the TOR, which make no reference to these issues.” Cat Newton, a senior policy officer at Calc, said it seemed like the government had largely forgotten the harm uncovered by the royal commission. “It’s good that the review is happening – it was slated to happen around 2022 – but what we really need is for this review to be meaningfully examining these issues, and making sure it’s proposing solutions that are going to prevent the harm that we saw at the royal commission, otherwise it’s not doing justice to those issues,” she said. Conflicted remuneration – commissions and other incentives – in selling financial advice were abolished after the royal commission but Newton said they remained at large in the insurance business. “We know it motivates appalling sales behaviour, where the emphasis is on making the sale rather than getting people into the product that they want or need and understand,” she said. “So we think all conflicted remuneration needs to go and that would be really beneficial to people, it would mean that they’re getting into products that they want and that they need and that are useful for them, rather than just being flogged a product based on somebody wanting a trip to Bali or a boat tour.”",News/Business,Consumer advocates accuse Morrison government of ignoring sale of junk insurance ahead of review,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/consumer-advocates-accuse-morrison-government-of-ignoring-sale-of-junk-insurance-ahead-of-review
2/3/2022,"“Patient” is a useful word for the reserve bank governor, Philip Lowe, when it comes to the timing of any interest rate rise. It’s vague and gives few clues as to how much time is left. After Tuesday’s RBA meeting, Lowe said the bank’s board “was prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve”. He echoed the sentiment at Wednesday’s National Press Club address on the year ahead.  We know Lowe would like wage rises to be “sustainably” higher than underlying inflation but we remain in the dark about how much they need to rise – and for how long – before the RBA would lift the official cash rate from the record low 0.1% annual rate it has sat at since November 2020. That matters for borrowers on variable interest rates but also for those experiencing price rises that are already making it hard to get by. It’s not that clear what constitutes “wages” for Lowe. Yes, there is the wage price index that he said had risen 2.25% in 2021 compared with the bank’s forecast of 1.75%. The half percentage point miss isn’t bad given we’ve been in the midst of a pandemic for two years. But the gap was more than twice as big for the underlying inflation result, which came in at 2.6% in 2021 compared with the 1.5% forecast by the RBA, implying real wages were in retreat last year. The RBA expects the wage price index to increase by 2.75% in 2022 and 3% in 2023. Its “central forecast” is for underlying inflation of 2.75% this year and next, suggesting that 2021’s loss in real wages won’t be made until at least 2024, depending on whether the index can keep outpacing inflation. But the “broader measures of labour costs” seem to be what Lowe – and to some extent the prime minister, Scott Morrison, as he seeks re-election in May – are relying on to lift wage earners’ confidence they are keeping ahead of price rises. These include superannuation contributions and “pay increases that arise from job switching and job reclassifications in a tight labour market” which is presumably going to be more common if the jobless rate drops below 4% as the RBA and the government expect. Economists, such as the head of Australian economics for the country’s biggest lender CBA, Gareth Aird, aren’t happy about the haziness. He described Lowe as “opaque” when it comes to how much wages would need to rise before the RBA hikes rates. “The RBA wants the annual rate of wages growth to be ‘3-point-something’ to ensure inflation is ‘sustainably within the target’,” Aird said in a briefing note. “But we are none the wiser on whether that means the governor wants to see the annual rate have a 3-handle on it before the cash rate is lifted or if a six-month annualised rate of 3% or above is sufficient.” Financial markets pared back their punt on when the RBA would first move to raise the cash rate to 0.25% after Tuesday’s statement – picking June-July rather than May. The CBA and Westpac reckon that move will come in August and the ANZ expects September, although Lowe was careful not to give a clear steer. Aird said the CBA’s internal data indicates the wage growth seen at the end of 2021 had extended into the early part of 2022 despite – or perhaps even because of – the Omicron Covid distortions. “An acceleration in wages growth is the natural response to a tight labour market,” he said, adding that trend reinforces the CBA’s forecast of an August rate rise. Lowe said Australia’s labor market had quirks such as wage negotiations that were often annual if not tri-annual events, supporting his rates caution. There is “substantial inertia in aggregate wage outcomes even if there are large wage increases in some pockets”, he said. Those workers, though, who are relatively early into their negotiation period won’t take much consolation from soaring prices now. Nor can they assume their lag will be caught if inflation gets away. New Zealand’s experience may offer some pointers, particularly for politicians on this side of the Tasman. Figures out on Wednesday showed unemployment there fell to a record low 3.2% in December, with further tightening to come. The ANZ described it as a “highly inflationary set of labour market data”, and said the Reserve Bank of New Zealand would need to lift the interest rate at every meeting until the cash rate is 3% by April 2023. New Zealanders’ wages are rising, but only at a 2.8% annual clip compared with inflation running at almost 6%. “As workers use their newfound bargaining power to demand larger-than-usual wage rises to compensate for surging inflation, that is likely to exacerbate the rise in domestic inflation pressures over 2022,” the ANZ said. Asked whether inflation could spike in Australia, Lowe reverted to form: “We are not worried about a massive inflation outbreak and are prepared to sit for a while.” Lowe may have the patience of a saint but he doesn’t have a mortgage to pay – as he disclosed in Wednesday’s address. Nor does he face the challenges of the 1.1 million people on jobseeker payments, 80% of whom have been on income support for over a year, according to the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss). People like Imogen, a Brisbane resident holding down part-time jobs in retailing and security, say their patience is worn thin by the debate over interest rates and politicians such as Morrison who don’t know the cost of daily basics such as bread, petrol and rapid antigen tests. “I’m very cognisant of the price of these things,” said Imogen, who requested her surname not be used. “The thing right now is that I am just out of milk today … and my bread is at the point where I should throw it out because it’s a little bit harder than desirable.” Rent eats up almost 80% of the support Imogen gets and if she earns extra she is penalised with reduced welfare payments. The economy may be recovering but if anything she has been going backwards. “Workers are spending more than ever on essentials, literally bread, milk, petrol, transport and rent,” she said. “We’re not getting as much for our dollars as we used to get last year, five years ago, 20 years ago.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, says people on jobseeker and Youth Allowance are “back to skipping meals, especially in the last days of their pay fortnight, they often have zero money for days”. “Most people on these very low payments can’t afford to own or drive a car, but if they do have one, they can’t afford to drive it as petrol prices climb.”  ",News/Business,RBA’s ‘opaque’ approach to interest rates no consolation to those hardest hit by inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/rbas-opaque-approach-to-interest-rates-no-consolation-to-those-hardest-hit-by-inflation
2/3/2022,"Aged care workers are among thousands of people locked out of Australia due to the government’s continued hard border for bridging visa holders. Australia is currently grappling with dire workforce shortages in the aged care sector, a problem compounded by the Omicron crisis.  At the same time, the government has continued its tough border restrictions for one visa category – bridging visas – despite opening the border for all other fully vaccinated temporary visa holders. Freedom of information documents show the continued hard border was affecting 18,993 active bridging visa holders in Australia who are hoping to leave the country, and 4,246 people who are stranded overseas, as at 15 December 2021. Those stuck abroad made 6,008 exemption requests to travel to Australia between August 2020 and mid-December last year. Only 1,595 were approved. Among those who were stranded abroad was aged care worker Kaur Simar, a registered nurse, whose employer in regional New South Wales had written letters of support, urging the government to let her in. Simar was stuck in Dubai and India since June, and made 28 applications for an inbound travel exemption on the basis of her work. All 28 were rejected. “My employer sent me several emails, which showed that they needed [registered nurses] in regional areas and they couldn’t replace me,” she said. “Even more RNs left regional areas for a better future in different states or cities.” “They were frustrated as I was.” Eventually, after more than six months, the government approved an exemption and gave her a skilled work visa, allowing her to return to Australia last month and work in Coonabarabran. For many others on bridging visas, the continued hard border has trapped them inside Australia. Some have been denied exemptions on compassionate grounds to attend funerals abroad. Others have been kept away from family for years. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Shorya Prashar, a Canberra-based restaurant manager, came to Australia on a temporary skilled worker visa, but is on a bridging visa while he challenges a decision by the immigration department in the administrative appeals tribunal. But the waiting times for AAT decisions have ballooned during the pandemic, leaving him stuck on the bridging visa for the foreseeable future, unable to travel. He has already been waiting 29 months, but expects it could take as long as three years. Prashar, who is fully vaccinated, has not seen his family in India since the pandemic began. He says it is deeply frustrating that the government’s continued border restrictions have singled out bridging visa holders. “We are paying taxes, we are working for an Australian employer, they need us, we are working full-time,” he said. “We can’t understand what the logic is behind this.” He said his parents, also unable to visit from India, have lost hope. “We are working here for the last six years,” he said. “We have given everything to Australia, like the taxes and everything, and still we are not eligible to get visas to go and come back to Australia. This is the only thing we want.” The federal government has previously defended its continued border restrictions for bridging visa holders. A spokesperson for the home affairs department said they were needed to “balance the need to safely reopen with the continuing need to protect the Australian community from Covid-19”. “These border policies have contributed to Australia having one of the lowest death rates from Covid-19, strongest economies and highest vaccination rates in the world,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Aged care staff locked out of Australia due to government’s bridging visa stance,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/aged-care-staff-locked-out-of-australia-due-to-governments-bridging-visa-stance
2/3/2022,"In every election the cost of living is a big-ticket item. This year, with inflation rising faster than it has for most of the past decade, the issue will likely dominate debate, especially as the big price rises in the past year have been for items we can’t avoid buying. On Tuesday, Scott Morrison was asked about the price of bread, milk, and rapid antigen tests. I am generally averse to such “gotcha” questions. They don’t actually reveal much about the abilities of the prime minister. Such questions mostly just lead to political advisors ensuring everyone is armed with the latest prices of groceries and some pithy line about what type of bread they like to eat.  I do however agree with Amy Remeikis who noted that knowing such things is “important when you lead a government that decided $44 a day was enough for those without a job to live on, and constantly bang on about needing to ‘live within your means’”. This is pertinent because on Wednesday the latest cost-of-living index showed that in 2021 the cost of living for those in vulnerable situations – those on pensions or jobseeker – rose quite ahead of those who live in households where the main income comes from employment: If the graph does not display please click here And yet for all households the cost of living grew less in 2021 than did inflation. The reason is to do with what counts as inflation and what counts as cost of living. To work out the consumer price index (CPI) figures, the Australian Bureau of Statistics puts together a basket of goods and services which it then weights in order to represent the average amount spent in a week on each item by the average household. For the cost-of-living figures, the bureau weights those items dependent upon the average spending of different types of households – eg employees, aged pensioners, self-funded retirees. The weightings given can vary quite a lot. Aged pensioner households, for example, spend 13% of their weekly expenditure on essential food and drink compared to 8% by employee households. Because they are older, self-funded retirees and aged pensioners spend a lot more of their budget on health than other households, and self-funded retirees spend a lot more on holidays than everyone else: If the graph does not display please click here The big difference though between the CPI and cost of living is housing. In the CPI the ABS measures house prices but not mortgage costs, while the opposite is true for cost of living. So, when house prices are rising much faster than mortgages (as they are now because interest rates have fallen) then generally inflation grows faster than cost of living: If the graph does not display please click here But this does not mean cost of living pressures are being exaggerated. What is important is what prices are going up the most. Last year the ABS issued a one-off look at the price rises of “non-discretionary items” (eg bread, rent, electricity, petrol, healthcare) compared to discretionary items (cakes, restaurant meals, motor vehicles, holidays). Even here there are issues – hairdressing is defined as “discretionary”, not so much because you can go without a haircut forever but rather because it can be put off. The same applies for items such as garments and footwear. Yes, we need clothes, but you generally don’t need to buy clothes each week in the same way you do food or paying for childcare or rent. What the figures show, when combined with the cost-of-living figures, is that poorer households spend significantly more of their weekly budget on non-discretionary items than do wealthier ones – and much more so than is represented in the CPI figures: If the graph does not display please click here This is important because in the past year there has been a big rise in the prices of non-discretionary items compared to more discretionary ones: If the graph does not display please click here And in the past decade the prices of non-discretionary items has risen by 26% compared to just 12% for those items we can put off purchasing. It all goes to the fact that while inflation is a useful measure, it can hide the reality not just of cost of living but also of the impact of price rises of items that you cannot avoid – in effect, the cost of essential living. But even here there is still more work that can be done. Even when we look at items as essential or discretionary there remains a great deal of difference within each category. In the UK, Jack Monroe has been campaigning to calculate what is known as the “Vimes Boots Index” of prices. The index draws on the Terry Pratchett character, Sam Vimes, who noted that having to constantly buy cheaper, badly made boots would end up costing poor people more in the long run compared to what wealthy people could afford – expensive but well-made boots that would last a decade or more. It’s why for example the ABS might suggest footwear is a non-discretionary item, but it only is if you can afford footwear that lasts. And so the cost of living should very much be a focus during this election – but if we just leave it with asking politicians the price of milk and bread, we are doing those for whom buying essentials is a daily struggle a major disservice.",News/Business,"With inflation on the rise, Australia’s cost of living will dominate the election debate | Greg Jericho",https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/feb/03/with-inflation-on-the-rise-australias-cost-of-living-will-dominate-the-election-debate

It’ll have been a long four-hour drive home after that carnival display.
