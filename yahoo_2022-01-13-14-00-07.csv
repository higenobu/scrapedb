1/13/2022,"Conspiracy theorist and pillow maven Mike Lindell made one of his wildest claims yet. “We already have all the pieces of the puzzle,” Lindell said on Real America’s Voice this week. “We have enough evidence to put everybody in prison for life, 300-and-some million people.” The U.S. population is estimated at 330 million. It’s not clear how much the “and some” in Lindell’s claim represents, but even at 300 million, that’s nearly everyone in the nation over the age of 5. All in prison: Lindell made his name selling pillows and was for a time one of the most frequent faces on Fox News, appearing in both his ads and as a guest until he had a falling out with the right-wing network. He has been a leading supporter of former President Donald Trump and pushed many of his false claims about election fraud, routinely promising that a unanimous Supreme Court decision in his favor would overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. All of his promised evidence has either not materialized or been quickly debunked, and Lindell backed out of a $5 million offer for anyone who could disprove his claims when several analysts stepped forward to collect. Lindell is being sued for $1.3 billion by Dominion Voting Systems in a libel case over his election fraud claims, which include debunked accusations against the company.

1/13/2022,"MOORHEAD, Minn. (AP) — A man accused of having sex with a 14-year-old girl was apprehended in Mexico on Wednesday, 21 years after he fled following his arrest in Minnesota, according to law enforcement. Curtis Lee Brovold, 67, was accused of having sex with the girl from Moorhead, Minnesota, whom he met online in 2000. Brovold was arrested later that year and charged with criminal sexual conduct, but he failed to show up for a court hearing and was placed on the most wanted page of the FBI's Crimes Against Children unit. Detectives from the Moorhead Police Department along with investigators from the FBI's resident agency in neighboring Fargo, North Dakota, determined that Brovold was living in Cancun. Brovold was arrested without incident outside his home on Wednesday afternoon. “The FBI has two things on its side when working fugitive cases: persistence and a very long memory. Both helped lead us to Curtis Brovold,” FBI Special Agent in Charge Michael Paul said. Brovold will be flown back to the United States and is expected to be transferred to the custody of Moorhead law enforcement, authorities said.
