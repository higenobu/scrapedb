3/9/2022,"Johnny Sexton will leave rugby on his own terms. Ireland’s captain and metronomic fly-half has signed a contract that will see him retire after next year’s World Cup in France. By then he will be 38 but his desire to rectify his country’s poor record in the tournament is driving him on. “I’m very grateful for the career I’ve had but you do look back and go: ‘We gave up chances at World Cups and didn’t perform at World Cups,’” said Sexton, who has represented Ireland at the 2011, 2015 and 2019 editions. “I want to put that right. “I’m still very driven to get there and perform in a World Cup. I’ve spoken to a lot of guys that have finished in the game and they have big regrets over World Cups.” Having played 103 Tests for Ireland and six for the British & Irish Lions across two tours, Sexton is conscious of the need to monitor his physical and mental well-being, while also maintaining a high standard on the pitch. He said the thought of missing out on a final World Cup haunted him, and he took heed from the examples of John Hayes and Gordon D’Arcy, two senior Irish players who were dropped before the 2011 and 2015 World Cups respectively. “It’s up to me to keep my body in good shape,” he said, referencing the prolonged careers of Brian O’Driscoll, Paul O’Connell, Peter Stringer and New Zealand’s Richie McCaw as inspirations. “It’s not like I’m the first person to do it.” Ireland have yet to progress beyond the quarter-finals from nine World Cups. Having lifted three Six Nations titles, including a grand slam, Sexton said the opportunity to propel his nation to a place its never been before is what motivated his decision. “I can still contribute and I want to,” he said. “I’m still very hungry to stay in the international setup. I don’t want to go out with a whimper. I want to go out on top.” That fairytale ending, though, is a blip on the horizon. Sexton said it was “strange talking about the next 18 months in the week of an England game”, suggesting he should have held back the news of his contract for a couple of weeks. To England then, and a trip to Twickenham for Sexton’s 15th match against the Red Rose. He has won two of his five previous trips – 20-16 in his third Test in 2010 and again in 2018 when Ireland secured their grand slam with a 24-15 win. Sexton has kicked 36 of his 946 Test points at England’s home of rugby and he knows that every one of them were hard earned. “It’s such a tough place to go to,” he said. “Think about how hard we are to beat at the Aviva. [Winning away from home] is such a hard thing to do in international rugby. We have to learn lessons from the French game [which Ireland lost 30-24 in Paris last month], put them into practice and get better.” Eddie Jones has labelled Ireland as favourites but Sexton dismissed the England coach’s comments, calling them “irrelevant”. He said: “They’ve been talking us up a bit. We know why they’ve been doing that.” Not to be outdone, Sexton was gushing in his praise of the opposition. He lauded their physicality and direct approach but reserved special praise for his opposite number. “He’s got it all,” he said of Marcus Smith who was 10 when Sexton made his Test debut in 2009. “To win the Premiership, to get his first English cap, to go on a Lions tour. He’s ticking a lot of boxes already. He’s got the world at his feet, it’s how he keeps those feet on the ground. He’s shown all the tricks – short kicking game, good passing game, good running game. He’s going to be a big player over the next 10, 12 years for England.” Reciprocal admiration has travelled in the opposite direction across the Irish Sea. Joe Marler said Sexton was “in the top three most competitive blokes” he had come across in rugby and the “standards he demands are astronomical”. As much as anything else, it could be the fear of what comes next that keeps Sexton moving. “When I hang up the boots I’ll be like a lost puppy for the first while.” A World Cup winners’ medal would surely ease his anxiety.",Sport/Sport,‘I want to go out on top’: Sexton commits to World Cup before England encounter,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/i-want-to-go-out-on-top-sexton-commits-to-world-cup-before-england-encounter
3/9/2022,"The Pentagon has dismissed Poland’s plan to hand its MiG-29 fighter jets to the US, to donate them to Ukraine. The Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, said his government was “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein air base and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America”, amid intelligence agency warnings that Vladimir Putin is about to “double down” in his invasion. However, the Pentagon appeared to reject the proposal, saying it was not “tenable”. The US Department of Defense said the prospect of the jets departing from a base in Germany “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance”. Ukraine’s government accused Russia of breaking a ceasefire agreement, by shelling a route intended to allow civilians to escape the besieged city of Mariupol. Not only are residents of the port city suffering Russian bombardment, they are also living without heat, water, sanitary systems or phones. Russia said earlier it was opening humanitarian corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol so civilians could be evacuated. Some Sumy residents, including Nigerian and Indian students, have now left the city on buses. Two million people have fled Ukraine since the war began less than two weeks ago, the UN refugee agency reported. Russian officials have pledged a fresh ceasefire at 7am GMT on Wednesday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, echoed Winston Churchill and invoked the fight against Nazism as he made a direct plea to British MPs in an impassioned video address to do more to help protect his country in the fight against the Russian invasion. Joe Biden announced that the United States will ban imports of Russian oil “to inflict further pain on Vladimir Putin”. The European Union has not joined the ban, but the European Commission said it was possible to reduce the EU’s use of fossil fuels by two thirds this year. The British government promised to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. McDonald’s became the latest western company to announce it was pausing its operations in Russia, after facing a backlash from social media users for not taking a stand on the war in Ukraine. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, issued an appeal to international corporations to stop doing business in Russia. Shell, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, PepsiCo Inc and Estee Lauder are also among the companies that stopped doing business in Russia. The World Health Organization said attacks on Ukrainian hospitals, ambulances and other healthcare facilities had increased “rapidly” in recent days and vital medical supplies were running low. The UN agency said it was working to urgently get medical supplies to Ukraine. Among the supplies running low are oxygen, insulin, PPE, surgical supplies and blood products. The European Commission has prepared a new sanctions package against Russia and Belarus that will hit additional Russian oligarchs and politicians as well as three Belarusian banks, Reuters reported. Sources told the news agency that the sanctions would ban three Belarusian banks from the Swift banking system and add more Russian oligarchs and politicians to the EU blacklist. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs has said that 12,000 Russian personnel have been killed in its latest assessment of their losses to date. They said so far Russian forces had also lost 48 aircraft, 80 helicopters, 303 tanks, 1,036 armed vehicles, 120 artillery pieces and 27 anti-aircraft warfare systems. The head of the CIA told US lawmakers on Tuesday that it believed between 2,000-4,000 Russian soldiers had been killed.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 14 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-14-of-the-russian-invasion
3/9/2022,"Administrators of the collapsed Probuild building empire say they will investigate a transaction last year in which almost $50m was transferred from other parts of the business to the group’s struggling civil construction division. Company documents show Probuild’s civil construction company, WBHO Infrastructure, borrowed $48.7m from other parts of the group last year as it struggled to survive massive losses caused by one of its key projects, the western roads upgrade in Melbourne. The loan included $29.2m from Probuild’s building arm, Probuild Constructions (Aust), sparking industry fears money that could have been used to pay subcontractors was instead used to prop up the infrastructure arm of the business, and leading to renewed calls from the construction union for reforms protecting payments to subbies. An additional $19.5m came from the head company of the Australian Probuild group, WBHO Australia. Industry sources say that only about $5m of the loan has been repaid. Through a spokesperson, Probuild’s administrators, Deloitte partners Sal Algeri, Jason Tracy, Matt Donnelly and David Orr, said they could not comment on the group’s finances because they were focused on “stabilising the businesses and securing sales to maximise the outcome for employees and all creditors”. “But yes the issue will be examined,” the spokesperson said. On Monday, the administrators said they had reached an “in principle agreement” to sell most of Probuild’s Victorian assets to NSW company Roberts Co, resumed work on a hotel project in East Melbourne and handed the Westside Place Ritz Carlton project in Melbourne’s CBD back to its developer, Far East Consortium. Probuild’s directors called in the administrators a fortnight ago after the group’s owner, South Africa’s WBHO, decided to stop financially supporting it, despite previously providing a letter to the Australian companies promising support until the end of June. In a statement to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, WBHO blamed the collapse on factors including Covid-19 restrictions and a decision by the Foreign Investment Review Board in January last year to block the sale of the business to China’s state-owned China State Construction Engineering Corporation for a reported $300m, saying the Australian businesses “have not being able to complete projects on time and not been able to recover variation and delay claims”. The company’s statement was “not short on self-justification”, federal court judge Jonathan Beach said last week in a ruling allowing the administrators more time before they have to call a meeting of Probuild’s creditors. Dave Noonan, the national secretary of the construction division of the CFMEU, said the circumstances of the $50m loan should be established. “The industry is rife with rumours that Probuild was compelled to provide cash to the failing WBHO civil business,” he told Guardian Australia. “We’d like to see this cleared up. “This is a builder that’s had a good reputation for a long time and it’s very disappointing to see them go down in this way.” Noonan said he was speaking only as a union official and could not comment on behalf of the development arm of super fund Cbus, Cbus Property, where he is a director. Cbus Property is the developer of one of Probuild’s worst-performing projects, a residential skyscraper in Brisbane on which Probuild has chalked up $42m in losses over the past two years. Financial reports show that both Probuild Constructions (Aust) and WBHO Australia were in poor financial shape when they made the loan to WBHO Infrastructure. Weighed down by the Brisbane losses, Probuild Constructions last year declared a profit of $3.1m but had significant negative operating cashflow of $85m. WBHO Australia declared a $31.6m loss and was also haemorrhaging cash, with negative operating cashflow of $225m. WBHO has been contacted for comment. Noonan said Probuild’s failure meant uncertainty for the dozens of subcontractors and hundreds of workers employed by the company. “Like every major builder, the vast amount of work is done by subcontractors, that’s the way the industry works,” he said. “If they don’t get paid, the workers lose their jobs – and perhaps their entitlements.” He said the government should implement a key recommendation of a 2017 review of payments in the building industry conducted by former Master Builders boss John Murray and force builders to hold payments for their subcontractors on trust. Under the model suggested by Murray, the head contractor would only be allowed to pay themselves after they had paid subcontractors. Murray told Guardian Australia he could not comment on Probuild’s circumstances. Speaking generally, he said a trust regime was needed because “if that money is not ringfenced, the builder is able to use that money as they see fit, for other projects or as free working capital”. “The current security of payment legislation is just a dog’s breakfast, it’s an absolute disaster because it disincentivises people to use the legislation.” Master Builders and other industry groups have consistently opposed the idea and the federal government has not acted on Murray’s recommendation. “I had underestimated the level of opposition towards that concept, but also the lily-livered, jelly-kneed politicians who lack the appetite for reform,” Murray said.",News/Australia news,Probuild collapse: administrators investigate $50m transferred to civil construction division,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/probuild-collapse-administrators-investigate-50m-transferred-to-civil-construction-division
