3/17/2022,"Chelsea cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Women’s Super League to two points with a comfortable 3-0 defeat of Everton. First-half goals from Sam Kerr, Guro Reiten and Erin Cuthbert ensured the visiting team, who have a game in hand over their London rivals, remained hot on the heels of the Gunners. Hosts Everton boast a squad that arguably should be further up the table, but wholesale changes in the summer, with nine incoming players, ruptured the momentum of the team and resulted in the sacking of Willie Kirk and the recruitment of former Lyon manager Jean-Luc Vasseur. Everton had won back-to-back games for the first time since October prior to the visit of Chelsea, contributing to over 35% of the team’s points tally. In the most recent, they came from a goal behind to earn a 3-2 win over Leicester thanks to a goal from Toni Duggan and a double from Swede Anna Anvegård. Having dispensed with Vasseur at the start of February, the fortunes of the club looked to be turning under Chris Roberts, who has temporarily stepped up from assistant. In the reverse fixture Chelsea scored four at Kingsmeadow, but a tough game on Sunday saw them reliant on an injury-time goal from Kerr to squeeze past Aston Villa. Cuthbert had said that game was “the type of game that wins you championships” and that it had “given the team a lot of energy”. “I feel like we really need to use that against Everton and use it as momentum to now kick on,” she added. If Chelsea were fearful of slipping away from league leaders Arsenal there was no sign of it at Walton Hall Park. Kerr ensured Chelsea got in front early on. Just six minutes in, the dynamic Australian forward glanced in a cross from defensive midfielder Sophie Ingle for her 12th goal in the WSL this season. Less than 10 minutes later they doubled their lead. As Everton attempted to work the ball out of their area, under intense Chelsea pressure, the loose ball fell sweetly for Reiten on the edge of the box and she fired in. Reiten would have a hand in the third too, sending a ball into the middle which Fleming knocked into the path of Cuthbert who fired into the top corner. There was a delay at half time with an injury to referee James Bell forcing the fourth official Ed Duckworth to step in for the restart but there was no change in the Chelsea pressure when the game did resume. At the hour mark there was good news for Chelsea as captain Magda Eriksson was introduced after a spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury. The second half lacked the intensity of the first but ensured Chelsea will have the opportunity to leapfrog Arsenal next Wednesday should they beat Tottenham at home, after the weekend’s FA Cup quarter-final against Birmingham.",Sport/Football,Chelsea keep heat on Gunners at WSL summit with cruise against Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/everton-chelsea-wsl-match-report
3/17/2022,"After an airstrike flattened the school behind his house and artillery shells ripped apart a circle of neighbouring homes, Dmitry Yakhshyboyev went out to look for petrol. His family, from seven-month-old son to parents in their 70s, had been cowering in their basement without heating, electricity or running water for two days, as Russian forces assaulted their village. As the occupying soldiers razed buildings to the ground, taking their chances on a dash past tanks and through the frontlines gradually came to seem like the safer option for Yakhshyboyev’s family. “We had a choice. Stay and die, or risk driving through the shelling,” he said, tracing the circles of destruction on a satellite map of his village, Posad-Pokrovske. They had an ancient Soviet-era Zhiguli car, its back windscreen blown out by shockwaves from the bomb that levelled the school. Yakhshyboyev’s boss at an IT store had stored about 10 litres of petrol. So on Wednesday morning, the day after the school was brought down, and one neighbour’s house so totally incinerated that the remains “looked like an ashtray”, they set off in a two-car convoy. There was barely room to cram their family into the car, with a small backpack of vital documents. The animals he loved like family – three dogs, seven cats, a cow, three pigs, three guinea pigs and several parrots – were set free to give them some tiny chance of survival. “What a terrible day, what a terrible life,” he said, burying his face in his hands as he listed the beloved companions left behind. When the group reached the relative safety of the port city of Mykolaiv, they paused, briefly, to gather supplies, patch up the back of the car with plastic, and consider how their lives had been ripped apart by the war. It is a mark of how vicious the war in Ukraine has become that they considered this frontline city, where conversations are punctuated by the regular thud of artillery exchanges, something of a refuge. Mykolaiv itself has been under intense bombardment since the first days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, because it controls a crucial bridge to the city of Odesa, cultural and economic jewel of the Black Sea coast. Without control of the port and the crossing of the Buh river, it would be very difficult for Russian forces to supply anyone fighting for Odesa, which has defied expectations. Ukrainian forces have not only held out, but say they are now pushing Russian forces – once just outside the airport – several miles from its outskirts. “The city is safe enough,” said Vitaly Kim, the young governor of the Mykolaiv region, whose upbeat daily videos on social media have helped keep up morale in the city as it was pounded by Russian forces. “The battles are now about 20km [12 miles] outside the city; we are on the offensive now,” he told the Guardian in an interview in his heavily fortified offices. Despite his optimism about the city, he acknowledged terrible loses in areas still under attack; in some the fighting has been so intense that bodies lie uncollected in the streets, locals said. “In small villages [in contested areas] there is a terrible situation, because Russians bombard them. But I can’t do anything about Russian bombs because we have open skies.” Russian warships are also massing ominously in the Black Sea south of the port, raising the risk of fresh attacks on a city still reeling from weeks of heavy assault. More than half the prewar population has fled, and those that remain are hungry and running out of vital medicines. “There are food shortages, medication shortages and a refugee crisis of people who have fled into the city from nearby villages. Lots of people who want to leave cannot, and this is a major problem,” said Andriy Skorokhod, head of the local branch of the Red Cross. Medicines that are running out include insulin and L-thyroxine – a medication needed by survivors of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster. “Because of Chernobyl, we have a lot of people dependent on this, but we are out of stock. Actually it is a national problem,” Skorokhod said. Kim, the governor, said supplies were being rationed as the city stockpiled to prepare for possible siege, but no one should be going hungry. “Compared to normal life the situation is bad, but for wartime life, the situation is good. People have everything they need, although not everything they want.” For now, the city is not besieged, but the main highway to Kyiv has been cut and many drivers are fearful of the 75-mile road to Odesa, Kim said. And as residents leave, they are replaced by people escaping from the rural frontlines. Red Cross buses can only take out about 1,000 people a day, from a city that before the war was home to nearly half a million people. Tatiana and Sergei Pinaev, 41 and 49 years old, hitchhiked out of their village north of Mykolaiv on Wednesday morning. It sits on a highway and there had been fighting in the area for weeks, which recently became too intense. “The Russians looted the shops, and bombed the kindergarten,” said Tatiana, sharing pictures of a Russian tank marked with the “Z” which has become the symbol of Moscow’s campaign, taken secretly from her yard. War planes roared low and loud overhead so often that the children learned to sleep through it, to Tatania’s horror. “First you cry, but then you get used to it,” said 13-year-old Anastasia. Her mother decided that the sounds of war were not the lessons she wanted for her children. They had to leave without his elderly parents, too frail to travel, who urged the couple to save their children then try to come back. Picked up from the wreckage of their village by a friend, they were dropped at the Mykolaiv train station with little money and few ideas about how to escape beyond heading west towards relatives in Germany. They found a Red Cross volunteer who took them to a shelter, and asked them, as the thud of artillery rounds echoed in the distance, where they wanted to go next. But another heartbreaking parting already loomed, the war which had taken away their home, now ripping apart their family. Sergei would have to go and register at the military commission, the Red Cross team said. As the father of three children under 18, he should be legally exempt from a bar on leaving the country, but no one in Mykolaiv appeared to know this rule. His daughters, Anastasia and six-year-old Veronica, threw themselves at him weeping and begging “no, Papa”, and “please don’t go”. As the family were ushered outside, the mother and children to a bus, the father to an uncertain future, a new throng of dazed escapers from the frontline, carrying small bags or nothing at all, filed off a bus outside the Red Cross centre. A month ago, Konstantin Hakimov was head of customs in the small port of Chornomorsk, south of Odesa. Now he spends his days driving into frontline areas around Mykolaiv to pick up stranded civilians in old city buses. He had been out twice on Wednesday by midday, his hands caked with grime from long days on duty, when he stopped for an embrace from one passenger, an old woman who thanked him, but begged him to go back for her husband. “They don’t shoot civilians but they will shoot soldiers. Everything there is destroyed, and there are Russians around,” he said. “I volunteered because we have to get the civilians out, and if I don’t do it who will?”  ",News/World news,"‘First you cry, then get used to it’: Ukraine villagers find a kind of refuge in Mykolaiv ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/mykolaiv-ukraine-bombarded-port-city

3/17/2022,"These wall-stones are wondrous. The fates broke them. Pavements were smashed. The work of giants is decaying. Medieval English poetry loved nothing better than a beautiful ruin: moss-encrusted decay, dying grandeur, the empty hearth. Although, to be fair, medieval England was also cold, damp and prone to violent marauders. Unsurprising, then, that medieval English poets should get a little tearful at the thought of wet rot and not being able to light the fire. But it seems fair to say they would have found a source of transcendent inspiration in the current, gorgeously decayed iteration of Manchester United: the waving arms, the tortured faces, the uncanny melancholy of those cold white midweek lights. The day before Atlético Madrid’s brilliantly executed 1-0 win in Manchester, a defeat that casts a shadow not just over the current United season but the next one too, the news broke that Old Trafford could be flattened and rebuilt from the ground up. This probably makes good economic sense. But there is an aesthetic concern too, because there is an irresistible beauty in the gargoyles, the bowed walls, the mouldering buttresses, the wreckage of two decades of parasitic ownership. Just listen to those howls again, the acoustics that make every sound, every song, every attempt to jolly up these post post-industrial ruins sound like an achingly empty Joy Division bass riff. Perhaps Andy Burnham should slap a blue plaque on this place before they can call the bulldozers in. Because this is also a kind of art. Not to mention, once the ledgers of overspend and underachievement have been tallied, a kind of natural justice. Rejoice, for Manchester United will win nothing again this year. And it seems that elite sport, or at least the part we see on the pitch, still has some kind of logic to it. This is not tribalism or a comment on the fitness of football governance elsewhere. Other deeply cynical Premier League ownership structures are also available. But the subject here is the unique Old Trafford take on where elite football finds itself. And this is, above all, a tale of mediocrity and greed finding its own reward. Manchester United will now cruise past five years without winning a trophy. During this time the club have employed three laughably disconnected managers, done nothing to promote or protect their own infrastructure, splurged on an incoherent jambalaya of starry players, tried to join a super league and, as a kind of sparkly distraction, elected to pay half a million pounds a week to a non-essential 37-year-old celebrity. What message, as we say in football journalism, would it send out, what template would it set, if such multi-layered ineptitude were to result in success? As opposed to the just rewards of haunting and cinematic failure? Make no mistake, this runs deep. There is still a temptation to be wowed by the moth-eaten pageantry, by the spectacle of Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes sitting like ancient sad dying gods around the TV punditry table, and to seek overly simple one-shot solutions. Scholes, who looked genuinely soul-sick in the post-match chat, kept suggesting that “a really good manager” could solve United’s on-field problems. There is even a hint of the obsession with the past, with that great lost Fergie-land in the skies. Clubs are no longer governed by a single personality. Success flows from policy, clarity, interlocking corporate tiers. But Scholes has a point. Since Alex Ferguson retired United have hired three managers, including the past two, who have never won a major league title. Louis van Gaal and José Mourinho were doomed attempts to import instant success. Ralf Rangnick, almost touchingly, is a doomed attempt to bolt on a soul, a method, a sense of someone here actually having a plan. Yeah, let’s get one of those method guys in. Bring me a sensitive German. The real issue is that the head coach is just the part you can see. Safe to say that same level of competence has been applied to every level in between. The playing squad was described repeatedly this week as “the most expensive ever assembled”, but this ignores the reality of overpaying for overpraised footballers. Harry Maguire is the most expensive English defender by an absolute mile. Is he the best English defender? Is he even a very good defender? Is he, in reality, a game and eager footballer who played at a decent level for Hull (54 games) and Leicester (69) before this inexplicable garland was placed on his slab-like brow, and the game became unwinnable? The players have suffered in this confusion. The suggestion of a kind of sickness, of toxic characters, of a group who are simply not trying reached its apogee after the 4-1 defeat by Manchester City, spurred on by some classic chuck‑a‑circle‑around-a-player-and-say-look-he’s-not-running style of TV punditry. The reality is that the players are not corrupt, flawed human beings. Like less famous clubs, Manchester United can also lose by not being good enough. When Atlético scored their expertly worked winning goal on Tuesday Maguire and Diogo Dalot looked lost, outgunned, defeated by a greater intensity and precision. Is this because of some deep cultural dressing-room sickness? Or is it because they are Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot, being asked to perform without any real sense of a system or a plan? Later on, as United chased a game that was always out of their reach, Rangnick sent on Nemanja Matic, Edinson Cavani and Juan Mata (combined age: 101). Is this what a Champions League quarter‑final looks like? Does this vision of success deserve to defeat the thrillingly dark, deep notes of Atlético, whose wage bill is less than half that of their debauched and sclerotic hosts, but who at least present a coherent picture; some sense of team-building, of the ways sport can be uplifting and instructive? As Ferdinand noted on BT Sport, a “holistic” solution is required. But give some credit. What United are currently producing is an entirely joined-up, perversely logical vision of incoherence, from the vacuum between head coach and owners that has been filled by endless floating blokes (so, so many blokes), to the obsession with branding and eyeballs that has infected every part of this organism. Never mind the soulless, highlights-reel quality of the football, the emptiness of winning just enough games by producing just enough moments of brilliance. This is a fully realised vision of profiteering waste, one that can only be interrupted by the distant prospect of a change of ownership. There is even a kind of beauty, a glory in that ruined structure; albeit one that will before long, without a little care, a little love, find itself vanishing into the soil.",Sport/Football,Manchester United: a tale of mediocrity and greed finding its own reward | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/manchester-united-mediocrity-greed-finding-iown-reward
3/17/2022,"The long, necessarily cloak-and-dagger struggle to secure the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori is a story that started in New York and – via the Sultan’s palace in Muscat and a cold pavement in London’s King Charles Street – ended with nail-biting delays at Tehran international airport. After the two British-Iranians were finally freed on Wednesday, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and her team received plaudits in the House of Commons for her role and quiet determination in overseeing this extraordinary endeavour. Others will say it should never have taken so long, and in a moment of triumph she has resorted to some brutal realpolitik, leaving behind other British citizens, like Morad Tahbaz, in Iran – ostensibly released from prison on “furlough”, but in reality still under armed guard. It is also true that Truss happened to be in office – the fifth foreign secretary to have the file – when the moment for a deal finally became ripe. But the foreign secretary did invest significant personal effort in the negotiations with Iran, with no guarantee of success. She was on the phone to Richard Ratcliffe, Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, within days of taking office, and made a point of meeting Iran’s new foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in New York on the fringes of the UN general assembly in September, the first person-to-person meeting between the two countries since Jeremy Hunt returned empty-handed from a meeting in Tehran three years earlier. Most of the meeting was taken up with the discussion of how the issue of the £400m debt and the dual-national detainees could be progressed after two false starts earlier in the year. But Truss was also galvanised by an unexpectedly successful 21-day hunger strike by Richard Ratcliffe outside the Foreign Office on King Charles Street in freezing November. With his small tent pitched so close to parliament, Ratcliffe’s cause became Westminster’s as MPs struck by his personal integrity developed a cross-party respect for him. The political momentum must have left the Foreign Office reeling. One meeting in Westminster Hall overflowed with MPs who had been to see Ratcliffe on hunger strike and were now demanding the debt be paid. By then it had become clear to Truss, as to previous foreign secretaries, that no British detainee in an Iranian jail was going to be walking free until the £400m debt to the country had been repaid. In her own mind, the first issue – one of moral hazard – could be overcome: this was payment of a debt, not succumbing to a ransom demand. The second issue increasingly became how to make the payment, which had been an obstacle for years, since US sanctions imposed after the collapse of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 closed off many avenues, such as payment to the Iranian Central Bank, the country’s preferred method. The evolving attitude of the Biden administration in the US became critical. At the turn of the year Truss turned to a trusted intermediary – Oman’s foreign minister, Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who she met at a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting on 20 December at her grace-and-favour residence, Chevening. Oman over the decades has acted as a home for discreet diplomatic back channels. Her own officials, including Laura Hickey, head of the Iraq desk, then travelled to Oman to finalise the details in Muscat. Much of this was done in anticipation of talks on reviving the Iran nuclear deal coming to a successful conclusion in Vienna – a potential turning point in British-Iranian relations, and indeed relations between the west and Iran. In Oman there were detailed exchanges between British and Iranian officials on how the debt would be paid. Iran argued that the monies were payable to its Ministry of Defence. The UK ruled that out and said paying it to the Iranian Central Bank or in cash, an idea once advanced by Boris Johnson, was not possible since it would be “fungible” – it would seep into other parts of the Iranian financial system, and possibly become subject to sanctions. So instead it was agreed that the money be paid first as a UK credit to the US, and the money then transferred to the Saman Bank using the Swiss Humanitarian Trade Agreement, a channel set up in 2020 by the Trump administration to let humanitarian trade to flow into Iran. Under the deal, the Swiss embassy, the US’s diplomatic representatives in Iran, have been charged with monitoring to ensure the money is spent on humanitarian purposes, such as food and medicines, and not missiles. The precise sum, and the issue of interest, had already been settled in earlier court cases that saw the UK’s high court rule that due to sanctions, no interest was payable to Iran on the debt, which was outstanding from the collapsed sale of Chieftain tanks to Iran in the 1970s. The third issue was “the third man”: Tahbaz, a conservationist with British, American and Iranian citizenship, accused of espionage after tracking endangered species with cameras. A previous UK attempt to settle the debt had collapsed partly over Tahbaz. In the interim between Biden’s election as US president and Donald Trump’s departure in January 2021, Dominic Raab, the then foreign secretary, proposed a deal to Tahbaz in jail whereby he would be left in Iran on furlough – out of jail but not free – while Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh would come home. The Iranians regard Tahbaz as American and so did not see him as a legitimate part of any bilateral British trade-off. Tahbaz, according to his family, rejected the Raab deal from his prison, and so did the US. At the time the outgoing Trump administration was not eager to see £400m flood into Iranian coffers. As a result the UK backed off, leaving Anoosheh and Zaghari-Ratcliffe in detention. But reviewing the issue last month, the Foreign Office evidently decided to change tactics. By then a former British council employee, Aras Amiri, had been released. The reasoning became: if the UK could get its two most high-profile detainees home, they should accept the offer, even if it was tough on Tahbaz and his wife, who is also trapped in Iran. The Tahbaz family only heard of the imminent Zaghari-Ratcliffe release through the British press on Tuesday, and battled to find anyone in the Foreign Office to admit to them that this time he had become expendable. The nail-biting delay before Zaghari-Ratcliffe left the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ hands was fruitless last-minute haggling over the terms of Tahbaz’s furlough. It feels like a dreadful betrayal for the conservationist, even if he is no longer in jail. He is the only British-born person among the three high-profile hostages and his family in the US and UK have been left wondering if they took the right course in not campaigning in public as much as the other families. His birth certificate, showing he was born in Hammersmith hospital, London, was of no use in persuading the British to stand by him. When it comes to the deal struck this week, there remain points of factual difference. Iran says it received the money – nearly £394m – from the British on Monday. The UK says the money did not touch the Iranians until Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori were safely off Iranian soil. Iran stands by its story that the two were spies. The UK says they are innocent. Iran claims an Iranian prisoner has been released by the British as part of the deal. The UK says that is untrue. But the bigger truth after the celebratory homecomings and hugs is that the Foreign Office needs to reflect on whether this release needed to have taken so long or to have been so painful. Equally, the families of those who have waited so long for their loved ones’ return will one day deserve frank answers from the diplomats and shadowy figures in the defence industry. It can hardly be a matter of celebration that British nationals were held in jail for so long when the solution – the payment of an outstanding and long-acknowledged debt – was self-evidently at hand. The Foreign Office reply remains to this day that the two issues – the debt and detentions – are separate, but this partition is a diplomatic fiction demonstrated by the fact that the detainees were put on a small plane to Oman only once the £394m had finally landed in an Iranian bank account. It should not have taken the personal courage and blind persistence of two ordinary citizens, Richard Ratcliffe and Sherry Izadi, the wife of Ashoori, to force the British state finally to do the right thing.",News/News,"Debt, sanctions and a cold Westminster tent: how the Iranian hostages were freed",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/16/debt-sanctions-and-a-cold-westminster-tent-how-the-iranian-hostages-were-freed
