2/22/2022,"An abandoned ship that caught fire in the mid-Atlantic last week was carrying $401m (£295m) worth of cars, including Porsche, Audi, Bentley and Lamborghini models, an insurance estimate has revealed. Felicity Ace, a specialist cargo ship carrying more than 4,000 cars, caught alight near the Azores on Wednesday evening. The vessel’s 22 crew members were evacuated but the fire continued to burn for several days, fuelled by lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles on board.  Insurance experts at Russell Group said on Monday they estimated that $438m of goods were onboard the ship, including an estimated $401m of cars and goods vehicles. Suki Basi, the group’s managing director, said the incident would result in losses of at least $155m for Volkswagen, which owns Porsche, Audi, Bentley and Lamborghini. “These figures showed once again the precariousness of global supply chains,” Basi said. “The incident comes at a bad time for global carmakers, who are in the middle of a supply chain crisis sourcing semiconductors, resulting in new delays for new cars. An event like this will not do a great deal in instilling trust with consumers.” The ship’s operator, MOL Ship Management (Singapore), said on Monday that the vessel was “still assumed to remain on fire south of the Azores drifting further away from the islands”. It said two firefighting tug boats were due to arrive at the site of the ship on Monday and would “start spraying water to Felicity Ace together with the patrol boat with the initial salvage team onboard already on site to cool down the heat from the vessel”. The company said the ship remained stable and was not leaking oil. Another salvage craft with firefighting equipment is set to arrive from Rotterdam on 26 February. João Mendes Cabeças, the captain of the nearest port in the Azorean island of Faial, told Reuters over the weekend that lithium-ion batteries in the electric vehicles were “keeping the fire alive”, adding that specialist equipment was required to extinguish it. It was not clear whether the batteries sparked the fire. Felicity Ace was travelling from Emden, Germany, where Volkswagen has a factory, to Davisville, Rhode Island, according to the website MarineTraffic. VW has not commented on how many of its cars were onboard the ships. The automotive enthusiast website The Drive reported the ship was carrying 189 Bentleys. Ship manifests show that on a previous voyage last month it carried 21 Lamborghinis.",News/Business,Abandoned burning ship ‘had $400m cargo of luxury cars’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/abandoned-burning-ship-had-400m-cargo-of-luxury-cars
2/22/2022,"Medina Spirit has officially been disqualified from the 2021 Kentucky Derby. The colt crossed the line first in May’s race but failed a post-race drugs test. His trainer, Bob Baffert, was banned from entering horses at the Kentucky Derby for two years after the controversy. He denied deliberately doping the horse, which had been a 12-1 outsider to win the race, and blamed the failed test on an ointment used to treat a rash on the horse. Medina Spirit died in December after suffering a suspected heart attack while working out at California’s Santa Anita track.  On Monday, the Kentucky Horse Racing Association also fined Baffert $7,500 and handed down a 90-day suspension. Medina Spirit’s owner, Amr Zedan, will not be allowed to collect the $1.8m prize for winning the Derby. Mandaloun, who finished second behind Medina Spirit, is now the official winner of the race. Medina Spirit is the third winner of the famous race to be disqualified. In 2019, it was ruled that Maximum Security impeded the path of two horses in the final turn before crossing the line first.

2/22/2022,"First Wordle was a grassroots hit that went viral, then the the online word puzzle was bought by the New York Times for a seven-figure sum, and now it has spawned legions of imitators. From Nerdle to Worldle, the simple format has been copied in dozens of new ways in recent weeks, sometimes to satisfy urges unfulfilled by the original, such as the opportunity to play more than once a day, but also to step up the challenge, profit from online advertising, or tap in to niche interests.  The proliferation of replica games in particular reflects the experimental and collegial nature of software developer and online gaming culture, gaming experts said. Adam Procter, who leads Southampton University’s game design programme, said the copycats are mostly people taking advantage of Wordle’s simplicity to use it “as an exercise to learn some code or to flex their muscles”. A culture of “see if you can copy it” is “built into the DNA of software coding”, he added. In terms of reaching new users, the games that have been most successful are those that are a “unique variation” on the format, rather than the “carbon-copy clones”, said Prof Chris Headleand, head of games design at Staffordshire University. Here are some of the most popular and distinctive variations. One of the more popular spin-offs, Nerdle converts Wordle into a numbers game by challenging players to figure out an eight-character calculation, for example 7+6/3=9, in just six guesses. The game was created in the UK by Richard Mann, who has worked in tech startups for 20 years, after discussing with his teenage children about the absence of a Wordle equivalent for maths fans. His son worked out the 17,723 valid solutions for eight-digit Nerdle. “After playing it for a while on paper, we knew it was just as fun playing with numbers as playing with letters,” he said, adding that users especially enjoy combining it with Wordle as a daily test of mental agility. Since launching on 20 January, the game been played by more than 1 million people in more than 200 countries. The game raises revenue from advertisers and sponsors to cover its costs, as well as fundraising for child numeracy, but Mann hopes to grow it into an educational technology business since the game is popular among teachers who use it to build confidence among pupils and teach them new concepts. A geography-guessing game that shows a silhouette of a country or territory and gives users six chances to work out the answer, Worldle is now pulling in 2 million users daily. The game was created by Antoine Teuf, a 31-year-old French software developer. He has worked in online gaming and has previously unsuccessfully attempted to build web games, but had a eureka moment when he saw Wordle’s success and realised “it’s better to keep it simple”. Like some other developers, he’s set up an account on Ko-Fi, which allows users to buy him a “virtual coffee” to thank him for creating the game. So far, he’s earned €4,800. For those who think Wordle is just a bit too easy, there are several different versions of Crosswordle available at the moment. One describes itself as a cross between Wordle and Sudoku. The game provides the answer for the final row and the goal of the game is to fill in the rest of the grid. Another version, created by Robert Flack, a 35-year-old Canadian software engineer for Google, requires users to guess two intersecting words. He sees his contribution as reflective of developer culture, and plans to use it as a launchpad to make more games. “It’s really common for people in the software field to be passionate about building software, so they’ll often have side projects which are things they couldn’t make a full-time living from.” From Lordle of the Rings to Wizarding Wordle (for Harry Potter fans), there are any number of games aimed at testing just how diligent a fan you are. One especially popular game is Taylordle, created by three thirtysomething Taylor Swift superfans working in tech. In the first week, the game received more than 1.4 million visits and has now racked up 5.9 million plays. “We tried to populate the game with words that newer Swifties would know and then we also have words that maybe only the hardcore stans would be able to figure out,” the creators said, adding: “Our main goal now is to get Taylor Swift herself to play it.” There are a number of slightly more risque spin-offs, including Sweardle, Queerdle and Lewdle, which have a similar format to the original but using more specific vocabulary. Lewdle’s creator, Gary Whitta, a 49-year-old British screenwriter living in the US, developed the game with his friend Adam Nickerson, and has been surprised to see 4.5 million others enjoy it too, with the result that many now submit their own ideas for lewd words to include. “Since we both have a very juvenile sense of humour we wanted to see what a version that only used naughty words would look like,” he said. He added that in the original spirit of Wordle, there are no plans to monetise the game. “Neither of us really need this to be anything other than what it is – a fun hobby that has kind of grown a bit out of control in the most delightful way.”",Arts/Games,Spawn of Wordle: five of the best riffs on the hit word game,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/21/spawn-of-wordle-five-of-the-best-riffs-on-the-hit-word-game
2/22/2022,"Neighbours of a flat in which the body of a 61-year-old woman was found dead have claimed they have been raising concerns about her welfare for two years. Police officers forced entry to the property in south-east London on Friday after residents reportedly sounded the alarm over a balcony door banging open and shut as Storm Eunice battered the capital.  While the woman’s death is not being treated as suspicious, neighbours said they had contacted the housing association Peabody, which owns the property, repeatedly over the last two years over a “horrendous smell” emerging from the flat. One resident of the block told MyLondon that neighbours had complained about the smell 40 to 50 times to Peabody since 2019. She had to block her door off with a towel it was so bad. She said: “My son was getting headaches, he was feeling sick. When I was pregnant I was vomiting all the time. I would ask my neighbours ‘Can you smell that? Or is it because I am pregnant?’” Describing the police entry on Friday, she said: “We heard them run up the stairs and then ‘bang bang bang. They suddenly came in a rush. It was so frightening the way they ran in. My son said he froze and he called me to say ‘mum there’s a lot of police running in the block’. There was a really big van and a few cars.” A spokesperson for Peabody told the Guardian: “We are saddened to learn that our resident has passed away. Our dedicated Tenant and Family Support Team carry out regular welfare checks with people who may be vulnerable. “We did make repeated attempts to check on the resident and liaised with the police to try and make contact. We are offering support to neighbouring residents who will understandably be upset, and our teams are there today. “We are working closely with the authorities and will investigate all of the circumstances and actions taken in this case.” A spokesperson for the Met police said: “At 19:01hrs on Friday, 18 February police were called to a flat in St Mary’s Road, Peckham. “Concerns had been raised about the welfare of a woman who lived at the address. “Officers attended and forced entry.

2/22/2022,"The lifestyle shifts of the pandemic “have made people more open minded about body shape”, the London fashion week designer Rejina Pyo said at a preview before her show yesterday. Time spent at home in comfortable clothes “has shown us that clothes don’t have to restrict our bodies to make us feel special”, she said. “Some designers love to make clothes really tiny, but I have always designed clothes with a bit of room. Food is really important to me so I like to make clothes that are comfortable when your belly is full of dinner!”  Pyo, who has written a cookbook with her chef husband, served snacks and cocktails at her show at the Aubrey restaurant in a Knightsbridge hotel. “It’s a really fancy place,” she said. “I wanted to create that mood of excitement that you get at the beginning of the evening when you go out to eat with your friends and family. I love that moment when you arrive and see your friends and you can read their mood from what they are wearing.” An actor, a costume designer, a photographer and a new mother were among the show’s models. “Because our clothes are sized generously, we aren’t restricted to only using really skinny models,” the designer said. “And I didn’t want that typical stompy model walk. I said to the women, imagine you’re in a restaurant and you’ve stood up to go to the loo and spotted someone who looks interesting at another table – that’s how to walk across a room.” Taking inspiration from the anything-goes dress codes of supper clubs in 1920s America, the collection ranged from denim and tweed suits to an acid green ruffled gown and a slinky column dress. Some pieces were upcycled from deadstock jeans made for a previous collection. Neither Burberry nor Victoria Beckham, British fashion’s two most powerful brands, are taking part in this London fashion week. Burberry will stage a catwalk show in London next month instead; Victoria Beckham spent Saturday making a film of her new collection which will be shown online next week. Designers who have seized the opportunity to step into the spotlight vacated by the absent big names include Roksanda, whose show at Tate Britain featured the first NFT sold at London fashion week, a virtual ball gown shoppable on the designer’s own website through a partnership with Clearpay. Red carpet favourite Roksanda, whose front row featured the actor Harriet Walter in a lime trouser suit, brought her trademark exuberant glamour to a collaboration with Fila, which included puffer coats in the joyful rainbow brights of a patchwork quilt, and neon moonboots. “Sportswear and loungewear became much more part of my vocabulary over the past couple of years,” the designer said backstage after the show. Students from the English national ballet school replaced models at the first catwalk show in two years for Preen. “We were thinking about youth culture and youthful exuberance, so we wanted to work with young dancers. The students brought a phenomenal energy which made the project feel really joyful,” said designer Thea Bregazzi backstage. Erdem Moralıoğlu brought supermodel starriness to London fashion week, with Karen Elson opening his show dressed in an embroidered double-breasted black silk coat from the Erdem’s recent menswear collection, set off by a slim velvet scarf. “Having designed menswear for the first time, I thought it was so interesting to see how the silhouette was transformed when you put it on a woman,” he said. “That double breasted broadness looks so different when you see it on Karen,” the designer said backstage of a collection which revisited the gender fluid dressing and decadent nightlife scene of the 1930s. “There’s a Cabaret kind of sexiness to it – a louche cardigan, a glimpse of a bra.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Rejina Pyo brings roomy clothes that are ‘comfortable after dinner’ to the catwalk,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/21/rejina-pyo-brings-roomy-clothes-that-are-comfortable-after-dinner-to-the-catwalk
2/22/2022,"A five-year-old boy who was “hidden from the outside world” while isolating with Covid was murdered by his mother, stepfather and a teenager before his body was dumped “like fly-tipped rubbish” in a river, a jury has heard. Logan Mwangi, described in court as a “lovely little boy”, suffered 56 injuries to his head, face and body in the attack at his home in south Wales last summer, Cardiff crown court was told.  His mother, Angharad Williamson, 30, her 40-year-old partner, John Cole and a 14-year-old boy, who cannot be identified, “cooly and callously” concocted a cover-up, the court heard. Cole and the boy allegedly dumped the body in a river and Williamson rang the police claiming Logan had been kidnapped from his home in the village of Sarn, near Bridgend. The jury was told that Williamson’s relationship with Logan was clearly “fractured” while Cole had acted “unkindly’ to the boy in the past. The teenager was described in court as a complex, troubled and violent boy who did not like Logan and had threatened to kill him. On the day before Logan’s body was found, a social worker visited the family home but Williamson did not let her into the flat because, she said, Logan was isolating and was feeling “a bit up and down”, the court heard. Williamson, Cole and the 14-year-old deny murdering Logan. But Caroline Rees QC, prosecuting, said each of the defendants played their part. She said: “He would not have stood a chance against any one, let alone the three acting together. Having killed Logan, each played their part in a cover-up.” At 5.46am on 31 July, Williamson made an “apparently heartfelt” 999 call to police claiming she had woken up to find Logan missing, the court heard. She appeared to be hyperventilating and claimed he had been kidnapped. But Rees said it was a “manipulative performance”. Police quickly discovered Logan in the river. He was taken to hospital but pronounced dead at 7.15am. A pathologist found he had suffered “catastrophic” injuries, as severe as if he had fallen from a great height or been involved in a high speed crash. Experts concluded he must have suffered a “brutal and sustained” attack. Rees said CCTV footage caught Cole carrying what he accepts was Logan’s body to the river at 2.43am on 31 July. He was with the 14-year-old boy, who claims he thought it was rubbish being fly-tipped into the river. While the pair were away from the house, the light in Logan’s bedroom came on. The prosecution says this must have been Williamson. Later, Cole and the boy allegedly made a second trip out to hide Logan’s dinosaur-patterned pyjama top. Rees said they disposed of Logan’s body as if they were fly-tipping rubbish. Williamson claimed she woke at 5.30am and believed her son had vanished. She said she saw Cole and the boy assaulting Logan on 29 July, hitting him in the head and abdomen. The court was told that on 21 July Logan had been found to have Covid and went into self-isolation. The prosecutor said it must have been difficult for Logan and those around him for him to be confined. She said: “At the time of his death he was hidden from the outside world, there was no scrutiny.” All three defendants are also accused of perverting the course of justice. Williamson and the youth deny this but Cole admits it. Williamson and Cole deny causing or allowing the death of a child. The trial continues.",News/UK news,"Body of boy, 5, dumped ‘like fly-tipped rubbish’, Cardiff jury hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/body-of-boy-5-dumped-like-fly-tipped-rubbish-cardiff-jury-hears
2/22/2022,"Since 2016, successive data leaks have exposed the methods by which some of the world’s most powerful companies and individuals secrete eye-watering sums of money off-shore, beyond the reach of tax authorities and governments. Collaboratively reported by investigative journalists from around the world, the Panama, Pandora and Paradise Papers have held the dark practices and financial chicanery practised by the super-rich up to the light. This week the Guardian, along with 47 international partners including the Süddeutsche Zeitung and Le Monde, has published the latest addition to this crucial body of work. Also the result of a vast data drop by a whistleblower, the “Suisse secrets” revelations focus on the activities of Credit Suisse, one of the world’s biggest private banks and a traditional giant in Switzerland’s notoriously opaque financial system. Analysis of accounts linked to 30,000 Credit Suisse clients from all over the world suggests that, in multiple cases, a culture of complicity on the part of Credit Suisse has allowed huge sums of dubious provenance to be stashed away with far too few questions asked.  In some of the most egregious cases discovered by our investigative team, it is hard to believe that any proper process of due diligence took place at all. By 2010, just before the Arab spring revolt, an account opened for the sons of the Egyptian dictator, Hosni Mubarak, contained £138m. An attorney convicted in 1992 for money laundering on behalf of the corrupt Philippine dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, was allowed to become a client in 2000. Unbelievably, this was despite the bank having previously been ordered to repay looted funds to the Philippines after opening accounts for Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The accounts of human traffickers, torturers and participants in industrial-scale bribery in the developing world also feature in the leak. In response, Credit Suisse has argued that most of the cases uncovered by the investigation are historical and practices have since been tightened up. But more than two-thirds of the accounts detailed in the leak were opened after 2000, many were open well into the last decade, and some are still open today. Nor does the bank’s recent track record inspire confidence. Only last autumn, for example, the bank agreed to pay $475m to settle a corruption case relating to a Mozambican tuna fishing project. This is not an institution that seems to have learned lessons when it comes to risk management. More broadly, the leak suggests that Switzerland’s banking culture remains in need of far-reaching reform. The country’s infamous banking secrecy law – dating back to 1934 – remains in place, criminalising the disclosure of client information. It is true that, in 2018, Switzerland responded to international pressure by requiring its banks to share client data with some foreign authorities. But many developing countries are excluded from that system. Meanwhile, wealthy elites continue to funnel wealth out of cash-strapped countries, hiding their riches and evading the tax payments that would help impoverished governments to stay afloat. On Monday there were calls from the European parliament’s main political grouping for a review of the EU’s relationship with Switzerland in light of the Suisse secrets investigation. That would be a grave development for a country which has jealously guarded and defended its banks as a source of pride and wealth. The threat of being blacklisted should be a catalyst for necessary change in a sector that has been allowed to exist in the shadows for too long.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Credit Suisse: In search of a moral compass | Editorial ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/21/the-guardian-view-on-credit-suisse-in-search-of-a-moral-compass
2/22/2022,"The average wage of the top 1% in Britain rose to £13,770 a month in December. Jeevun Sandher, an economist at King’s College London, points out the very richest saw their incomes rise the fastest during the pandemic. This group were also likely to have been able to save the most while Covid raged. Where do the very wealthiest spend their cash? One place is housing, for which there is a low level of stock being released on to the market. The result is rising house prices. Over the past 12 months, asking prices have gone up by 9.5%. This has a knock-on effect for renters. UK rents rose by 8.3% in the last three months of 2021. For would-be first-time buyers, the situation is as bad if not worse, with the current average price of £277,000 nearly £25,000 higher than just a year ago. Those looking to have a roof to live under will find little solace in official figures. These record an 11% drop in the number of total homes added in 2021 compared with the year before. The number of new affordable houses that began being built dropped 16% year-on-year. Shortages of labour and materials, as well as planning delays, will make it harder for the 11th Tory housing minister since 2010 to meet government targets for new homes.  Britain’s housing stock is being turned into an asset class as a consequence of the excessive financialisation of the UK economy. For those who own their homes, these buildings serve a dual purpose: they provide shelter, and function as investments. For around 2.5 million landlords, who between them accounted for 18% of all property purchases in 2019, they are only investments. If the underlying problem is a lack of homes, then one solution may be to build more. But if the problem is landlords, and the fact that property owners are incentivised by rising prices, as well as their desire for more space (a desire that may have been augmented by the switch to home working), to buy as much of it as they can, then building more homes won’t help. It could even make matters worse, by creating more opportunities to extract exorbitant rents from those who have an income but lack the capital for a deposit, or the confidence to take on a huge debt. Over recent decades, ballooning property prices have served home owners well, especially in the south of England. The form of inequality this has created currently appears to be generational. Older people are more likely to own their homes than younger ones. City firms are ploughing billions of pension savings in “build-to-rent” developments that could see a transfer of wealth as younger people end up paying the pensions of older people. The Labour party could be bolder in dealing with the property haves and have-nots. Its housing policy is for first-time buyers to get priority in new housing developments and to ban foreign owners buying up new properties. But hoarding by commercial landlords that hurts young renters and many homeowners needs tackling. One suggestion by housing barrister David Renton is for “right to buy” to be extended to the private sector – say to where landlords own a minimum of five properties. There may be outrage from those who regard rent as economic growth. This surely must change. While Korea makes consumer electronics and Germany makes cars, Britain churns out buy-to-let landlords. There’s little to envy in such “success”.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on unaffordable homes: building injustice into the economy | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/21/the-guardian-view-on-unaffordable-homes-building-injustice-into-the-economy
2/22/2022,"What price an Olympic gold medal these days? We know about the blood, sweat and tears, but the costs paid by the 15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva in pursuit of the glittering prize rose exorbitantly over the past week in Beijing. The already unstable Olympic currency of values, integrity and humanity devalued further. There was almost universal horror watching Valieva’s coach, Eleni Tutberidze, in action. Her harsh questions as Valieva sought to escape the rink after her unravelling performance caused consternation. Even the fence-sitting International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, spoke out. But after the initial repudiation and disgust, her approach struck a troublesome chord. Perhaps a flashback to a teacher or parent, a sports coach or another instructor.  It has rung bells in my own head and with others I used to train and compete with. Sam Parfitt, chief executive of The True Athlete Project, said what is perhaps most chilling about Tutberidze’s behaviour is that it is “so reminiscent of what you’ll see every weekend, at all levels of sport, from coaches and parents of children who love and then inevitably hate sport”. The Beijing ice rink drama showed us new obscene depths of where a “win at all costs” mentality can end up. The IOC’s 2020 Agenda of Credibility, Sustainability and Youth that set out to “safeguard the Olympic values and strengthen the role of sport in society” seems irrelevant. As for the founding philosophy of Olympism that wanted to make the world a better place through sport, Baron de Coubertin’s principles lie shredded, carved up in the thousands of cuts in the Ice Cube’s Olympic rink. While Valieva’s Cinderella was left in tatters at the end of her skate in a plot with more sinister twists than most fairytales, the next few minutes brought two Russian ice sisters who extended the damage: first, the gold medallist, Anna Shcherbakova, spoke of feeling happiness yet at the same time emptiness. Then the silver medallist, Alexandra Trusova, cried: “Everyone has a gold medal, everyone, but not me. I hate skating. I hate it. I hate this sport. I will never skate again. Never.” Consider the experience of these young girls: rarely seen to compete beyond a single Olympics and forced to fit into a high-pressured “perfect princess” media narrative, they are soon discarded, damaged dolls left with only a hatred of the sport they once loved and for which they had found a talent. It is too easy to vilify the Russian Olympic Committee (and the system that enables them to behave with impunity). But we should refrain for a moment from throwing stones from our own glass-plated sporting world. Are we content we are sufficiently different from this detestably narrow pursuit of sport defined by national pride, a medal table and expendable athletes? Hasn’t the British press followed a consistently narrow approach each day, asking where the British medals are going to come from? Don’t we also have female athletes at the pinnacle of sport exposed to intolerable levels of pressure, with the case of the speed skater Elise Christie immediately coming to mind? Let’s seize this moment to get our own house in order. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson’s Duty of Care report from 2017 still has major recommendations outstanding while the Whyte report into British Gymnastics due in the spring will provide another important opportunity to scrutinise our high performance environments and learn some vital lessons. I have heard from a range of coaches around the world who conclude sadly that the past week in Beijing further proves that the only way to protect minors will be to bring in age limits for elite competition. Valieva has shown the human cost is simply too high. But whatever new regulations ensue, bigger change can only come from greater leadership to set a broader purpose for sport, shift mindsets and behaviours and instil meaningful metrics beyond medals. I have spoken to school heads of sport and performance coaches seeking to redefine the purpose of sport for their students and athletes. Aware of their responsibility to develop healthy citizens first and foremost, they want to reframe ambitions beyond the next local league trophy or international medal. Too many barriers block their way to building broader frameworks around sport based on values, personal growth, teamwork and a connection to wider communities. This sort of framework was clearly absent from Valieva’s experience but high performers deserve a healthy experience of sport, too. Opportunity lies at this juncture if only we can shake off the old engrained macho narratives and beliefs around sport. Take Norway, who have won a record-breaking number of gold medals in Beijing and top the medal table. This country of five million people has won more Winter Olympic medals by some distance, while taking a radically different approach to sport based on a concept known as the “joy of sport for all”. No early talent spotting or streaming; the focus is on participation in as many sports as possible. No individual rankings or national championships for children under 13. Tore Ovrebo, director of the Olympiatoppen high performance centre, has spoken of the importance of “developing citizens and not only athletes”. The defining moment of the summer Olympics last year was Simone Biles stepping back from physically and mentally hurting herself in competition – an incredible act of self-confidence and bravery that followed years of abuse from a similar age as Valieva. She became a global role model for reasons beyond the gymnastics arena. Biles, Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu are out in front changing the narrative around the meaning and experience of high performance sport. I hope Valieva is one day able to join them. Meanwhile, let’s step up to the plate as a country that has so much more to gain from sport than simply counting medals. Let’s create a better way to succeed in sport and beyond – the next generation deserves better. Cath Bishop is an Olympic rower, former diplomat and the author of The Long Win.

2/22/2022,"Vladimir Putin will recognise the Russia-controlled territories in south-east Ukraine as independent states in a pivotal decision, scuttling an existing peace agreement and possibly triggering tough new sanctions from the west. The Kremlin announced the decision on Monday evening. Putin is expected to make a video address on television shortly.  Putin told France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz in advance that he planned to recognise the Russia-backed Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics as independent states on Monday. The two leaders expressed “disappointment” at the decision, according to a Kremlin readout. France and Germany are both signatories of the Minsk agreement, a peace deal that will likely be abandoned as a result of the Russian decision. The announcement followed an extraordinary meeting of his security council broadcast on national television, where the Russian president said he would make a decision later on Monday following a choreographed back-and-forth with his top advisers designed to prepare public support for the decision. “We’ve been negotiating for eight years,” Putin told his aides at one point during the security council meeting. “We’re at a dead end.” In turn, each of Putin’s top advisers stood at a lectern and delivered a speech that ended in favour of recognition of the separatist states in Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which have been at war with Kyiv since 2014. The two territories are run by separatist governments widely seen as Russian proxy states inside Ukraine. Since 2014, they have been in conflict with Kyiv, which refers to them as “temporarily occupied territories”, similar to Crimea. They have received military and financial backing from Moscow since they declared their existence after the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. The two regions cover an area of about 6,500 sq miles and were primarily known before the war for their heavy industry and coal mining. Donetsk, the largest city, previously had an international airport and hosted matches during the Uefa Euro 2012 championship. The fighting has destroyed the airport and left the territories mostly cut off from the rest of Ukraine in a dire economic state. The borders with Russia remain open. What are their relationship to Moscow? Officially, Moscow sees the two states as part of Ukraine and has not recognised their independence, but it has dealings with the leaderships of the self-declared states. Unofficially, the two regions are seen as fully controlled by Moscow. Who are the people there? Leaked documents suggest there are just under 3 million people remaining in the territories, 38% of whom are pensioners. That’s less than half of the pre-war population. Public opposition in the territories is virtually non-existent. It has become extremely difficult for independent journalists to go to the region. How many troops are there? It is not clear how large a force is present in the two territories. Ukraine has claimed that there are “35,000 military personnel and 481 battle tanks, 914 armoured combat vehicles, 720 artillery systems, 202 multiple launch rocket systems on the uncontrolled territories of Donbass”. According to Rochan Consulting, however, those numbers could be “overestimated”. It ended in a made-for-TV cliffhanger. “I have heard your opinion – a decision will be made today,” Putin said. The broadcast then quickly cut to a news anchor. Putin has instructed his subordinates to “maintain tensions” with the west as he seeks “security guarantees” that would in effect reconstitute a Russian sphere of influence in eastern Europe. To that end, Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, threatening a massive invasion that could target Kyiv and other cities, according to western officials. The threat of official recognition for its two proxy states in Donetsk and Luhansk has also been a part of that pressure campaign. Russia has controlled and armed the two states since the outbreak of fighting in south-east Ukraine after a revolution in Kyiv in 2014 but wanted to keep them in Ukraine with the right to veto crucial decisions, such as membership of Nato. Ukraine has said it will contest any decision by Russia to recognise the territories’ independence and would recognise the move as a Russian decision to exit the Minsk agreement, the peace deal signed in 2015 that now appears close to collapse. After Putin’s speech, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said he had called for UN security council states to hold consultations under the Budapest memorandum to “discuss urgent actions aimed at de-escalation, as well as practical steps to guarantee the security of Ukraine”. This likely sets the stage for a meeting of the security council where Ukraine can put its case to the world. Any of the members can request an urgent meeting, which has to be held within 24 hours of the formal demand going in. Russia is the security council president and so may be able to control whether the meeting is closed or open. However, western member states that have been pushing hard for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis are likely to group together in a show of strength, one envoy said. Kuleba warned that any move to give the territories official status would represent a dangerous escalation. “Not only Ukraine, the entire world now closely follows Russia’s actions regarding the recognition of the so-called L/DPR. Everyone realises consequences. A lot of emotions out there, but it’s exactly now that we all should calmly focus on de-escalation efforts. No other way.” Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said any attempt by Russia to expand the territory controlled by pro-Moscow separatists would mean a full-scale war with Ukraine. The historic borders of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions are much larger than the exiting pro-Moscow-run areas. Key Ukrainian cities include the port city of Mariupol, Kramatorsk – where Ukraine’s army has its eastern HQ – and numerous villages. “Those regions are regular towns where people live regular lives. Any attempt to occupy those areas would be direct violent aggression by Russia on to Ukraine. There would be war,” Zagorodnyuk said. Putin may still choose not to recognise the two states’ independence, using the staged debate with his advisers to show western leaders that they are running out of time to negotiate. But it appears more likely he will follow the unanimous advice of his aides and close allies to recognise the two territories in a dangerous shift of the status quo. The decision could either freeze the conflict in south-east Ukraine or reignite it, depending on the Ukrainian response and whether Putin seeks to take further territory. Putin’s move surprised some analysts, who said that they believed that recognising the states as independent could relieve Putin of some of his leverage over Ukraine. “This is not where I thought we end up. I still do not see at all what is to be gained from the recognition of the Donbas,” said Prof Sam Greene, the director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London. “The breakaway regions were more useful for Putin formally as part of Ukraine than outside Ukraine.” But Putin may be searching for a win in his high-stakes confrontation with the west, in which he has sought to convince Joe Biden and other western leaders to pressure Ukraine into acceding to Russia’s demands or face a potentially devastating war. In their public discussion on Monday, Putin and his advisers made a show of airing their frustrations with Ukraine’s leadership. “If we speak about the situation that has unfolded around the [Donetsk People’s Republic] and [Luhansk People’s Republic], then it’s entirely clear that Ukraine in principle does not have use for these territories,” said Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, as he cast his vote for the proposition. Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin lead on talks with Ukraine, said the west was trying to “purposefully stall” in its negotiations with Russia and that no negotiated settlement was possible. By assembling his top advisers, Putin was also making a case for himself to approve the recognition of two territories that do not hold the same kind of appeal or cultural significance as Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Donetsk and Luhansk are both known for their coal mining and heavy industry and have become severely economically depressed since the outbreak of the war in 2014. At moments the meeting resembled a reality TV show as Putin’s advisers each took their turn making their case. Putin claimed that he hadn’t warned them of the meeting ahead of time, although that was difficult to believe. Monday’s decision was preceded by a series of incidents on the border that indicated the Kremlin was creating a case to recognise its proxy territories in southeastern Ukraine. The Russia-backed leaders last week announced a formal evacuation of the two territories, citing the rise in artillery fire and claiming that Ukraine was planning to launch a large-scale assault. And on Monday, Russia claimed its soldiers had killed five “saboteurs” who crossed the border from Ukraine into the Rostov region, as fears intensified that the Kremlin was creating a case to mount an invasion of Ukraine. No evidence was presented to support the claim, which was dismissed by Kyiv as the latest in a series of fake statements by Moscow. Russia’s Southern Military District (SMD) said a Federal Security Service (FSB) border patrol had identified a sabotage and reconnaissance group that had breached the border near the village of Mityakinskaya in the early hours of Monday morning. The border patrol allegedly called in troops for backup and in the ensuing clash five Ukrainians were killed, the SMD said. Ukraine dismissed the account as false information. “Another fake. We don’t have people there, nor could they be [there],” Ukraine’s military said. Russian officials earlier also said that a Ukrainian shell had destroyed a border facility used by the FSB.

2/22/2022,"Authorities in South Lake Tahoe in California have launched a special trapping effort to trap a 500-pound black bear known as “Hank the Tank”. Hank is, according to authorities, “readily identifiable due to [his] exceptionally large size and dark coat with a lighter muzzle”.  The average weight of a black bear in the western US ranges from 100lb to 300lb, according to the Washington department of fish and wildlife. Hank appears much larger. Since last July, Hank has broken into at least 28 homes in and around the Tahoe Keys area. Described as “extremely food-habituated”, Hank has also caused extensive property damage in over thirty documented cases. Local residents have filed at least 102 police reports about Hank. “It’s easier to find leftover pizza than to go in the forest,” said Peter Tira, a California department of fish and wildlife spokesperson, according to the New York Times. Authorities have used a combination of deterrents including loud sirens, dry-firing their tasers, which creates a “clicky-clack noise that the bears hate”, and beanbag rounds. However, none of these methods have proved successful. “This is a bear that has lost all fear of people,” Tira said. “It’s a potentially dangerous situation.” Ann Bryant, executive director of Bear League, a California-based wildlife rescue service, noted that it remained unclear how Hank acquired a human palate but affirmed that “he didn’t get fat like that eating berries and grubs”. On Friday, the South Lake Tahoe police department responded to reports of the bear inside a home. Hank had broken in through a small window and squeezed inside. Police banged on the outside of the home until he emerged and left through a back door. The authorities noted that residents could apply for a bear box, a locked container that campers typically use to protect food, for a fee. As efforts to trap Hank repeatedly fail, authorities have said they may need to consider euthanizing the bear, which they said was their “last option”. Earlier this year, authorities removed a bear trap after someone spray painted “Bear Killer” on it. “He just sits there and eats. He doesn’t attack them. He doesn’t growl. He doesn’t make rude faces … Why should this big dummy die?” Bryant told the Times.",News/US news,‘Hank the tank’: California officials seek to trap 500lb bear behind break-ins,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/21/black-bear-tahoe-hank-the-tank
2/22/2022,"Two severe “danger to life” flood warnings have been issued in Shropshire and Worcestershire after Storm Franklin brought a day of flooding, power cut misery and travel chaos on Monday. Parts of the historic village of Ironbridge were being evacuated as the river Severn threatened to overwhelm flood defences, and in Bewdley in Worcestershire, residents were told to expect flooding from Tuesday morning. The Environment Agency urged people to implement emergency flood defence plans and follow evacuation advice.  A further 129 flood warnings were in place as river levels rose across England and Wales. Matlock town centre in Derbyshire was described as a “river” by local resident Phil Gregory after the Derwent burst its banks. “It’s probably only a foot or two deep in truth, but enough to wreck businesses,” he said. “It’s just really terrible and the rain is continuing.” The town council described the flooding as devastating and urged people not to visit Matlock. Babington hospital in nearby Belper was under water and forced to close and cancel appointments. In Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, the main bridge was closed and shops flooded after the River Wharfe overflowed its banks. An Environment Agency spokeswoman said: “We are aware of a small number of flooded properties in Tadcaster and are working closely with the emergency services and other agencies to keep the community safe.” Train operators urged people on Monday to avoid travel if possible as services in some parts of the country experienced severe disruption and were expected to be halted by gale-force winds and heavy rain. Southwestern said more than 50 trees had fallen on to the tracks in the last three days. Southeastern said response teams had been “stretched to the limit” and that several lines were unable to operate in and out of London. Major road bridges were again closed because of high winds, including the Severn Bridge between England and Wales and the Dartford bridge crossing. Two stretches of motorway in north-west England were closed in the morning after incidents involving lorries, including one that overturned on the M60 in Greater Manchester. Airlines had cancelled 122 flights to and from the UK in the morning, according to data from analysts Cirium. British Airways apologised to customers who had faced additional long waits for luggage at Heathrow as well as flight disruption in the last few days. It said it was unable to operate the machinery needed to unload cases because of the high winds. It comes only days after Storm Eunice killed at least four people and left 1.4m homes without power. The energy minister, Greg Hands, on a visit to Kent, said 32,000 households across the UK remained without power. UK Power Networks, which covers the south-east, London and east of England, said around 12,000 of its customers had yet to have power restored. Basil Scarsella, the CEO, said it had decided to make extra goodwill payments to those worst affected by power cuts. “This means that if you were impacted by Storm Eunice, you will be eligible to receive £50 after 24 hours without electricity, an additional £70 when you reach 48 hours, and an additional £70 thereafter for every 12 hours without power.” On Monday, Northern Rail issued a “do not travel” alert to passengers, while TransPennine Express strongly urged customers to avoid travel if possible, particularly those planning to travel north of Preston in Lancashire before 10am. Great Western Railway urged customers to travel only if absolutely necessary as services were expected to be “significantly disrupted across the network”. Southwestern Railway also urged customers not to travel, warning that the weather conditions were “likely to hamper efforts to help stranded customers”. National Rail warned anyone making essential journeys once services resumed to expect major disruption to routes across most of the country, including cancellations, delays and slower train speeds. Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said last week marked the first time that three major storms – Dudley, Eunice and Franklin – had been recorded within seven days since the naming system began in 2015. The Met Office said Monday’s highest wind speed, 79mph, was recorded at Capel Curig in Wales, followed by 78mph at Orlock Head in Northern Ireland. The worst of the storms are over for now with no weather warnings in place for the coming days. It will, though, be “a blustery week”. The storms have had calamitous consequences for thousands of trees, including a clone of Isaac Newton’s apple tree that was planted at Cambridge University’s Botanic Garden in 1954. It fell on Friday during Eunice. A spokesperson for the gardens said: “We have a clone that will be planted elsewhere in the garden soon, so Newton’s Apple will remain in the garden, but sadly not in its accustomed place.”",News/UK news,Storm Franklin: ‘danger to life’ flood warnings in Shropshire and Worcestershire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/storm-frankin-hundreds-evacuated-and-travel-halted-uk
2/22/2022,"Two environmental activists have been convicted of charges relating to a protest against HS2 after occupying a 100ft-high drilling rig to highlight damage they claimed the rail project was causing to London’s drinking water supply. James Brown, 57, a partially sighted former Paralympics cycling champion, and James Ruggles 25, appeared at Uxbridge magistrates court charged with criminal damage and aggravated trespass after a protest in February 2020 when they climbed on to drilling machinery in the Colne Valley, Hillingdon.  Both spent several hours on the rig and unfurled a banner which said: “Protect London’s drinking water: stop HS2”. They and other environmental campaigners claimed the pile driving into a chalk aquifer in the Colne Valley posed a risk to 20% of the city’s drinking water supply. Brown was cleared of the criminal damage charge but found guilty of the aggravated trespass charge. Ruggles was found guilty of both charges. The men were given conditional discharges. The activists told the court they carried out the protest on the drilling rig to raise awareness about the environmental damage they believe HS2’s work was causing. “Because I have a bit of a public profile I believed that by being present on the day I might be able to attract public attention through the media,” Brown told the court. District judge Andrew Johnson said in his ruling that while he did not doubt the sincerity of the defendants, if this sort of conduct was not punished “it would lead to anarchy.” He added: “There has to be a line drawn.” Speaking after the ruling, Brown said: “This is one of an increasing number of climate and environment-related cases. I think in the months to come we will be seeing many more. Awareness of these issues amongst members of the public is massively on the rise. Our government is simply not tackling the climate crisis with the energy it requires.” An HS2 spokesperson said: “HS2 take our responsibilities incredibly seriously and we have a world-leading team of engineers, hydrogeologists, and environmental scientists in place to ensure that the construction of the Colne Valley viaduct affords the right protection for the environment, and is completed as safely and efficiently as possible. As a result, we have almost completed half the piling for the viaduct, with no impact on public water supply.”",News/UK news,Activists who occupied 100ft HS2 drilling rig convicted over protest,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/activists-100ft-hs2-drilling-rig-convicted-protest-paralympian-london-drinking-water
2/22/2022,"Nesrine Malik (Scared to be ‘woke’? It’s time for progressives to take a stand in the culture wars, 21 February) sets out the bemusing battlefield surrounding the concept of being “woke” and how it has been weaponised by the right wing of Conservative repression. Part of the issue is clearly the way different groups and factions define the meaning of woke. She correctly deduces that Labour needs to own it. We have already been pointed in the necessary direction by a man speaking in the saddest of situations. Dave Merritt, the father of the young lawyer Jack Merritt, who was killed in the London Bridge terror attack in 2019, gave a moving speech after his son’s inquest. He described how proud his son would have been to be called woke. He defined its meaning very simply as “the opposite of ignorant”.Ric CareySouthsea, Hampshire   Nesrine Malik expresses the problem brilliantly. But I’m so angry I couldn’t read her piece all in one go. Angry because it’s impossible to imagine anyone on Labour’s current frontbench saying anything a tenth as powerful, and angry that I, and many thousands of other members, were gulled into believing that Keir Starmer had a fairly radical and progressive agenda. He must have known perfectly well that he would never get elected if we knew then that he would align himself so completely, whether through conviction or tactics, with Labour’s right wing.Richard BarnesWindermere, Cumbria  The weaknesses of the west are not the result of a “painful woke psychodrama”, as the Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden claims (Report, 14 February). His slur is simply another distraction for those who are angry that the high-skilled, high-wage jobs promised by the neoliberals never materialised. We are among the largest economies in the world, yet 30% of children live in poverty and we have food banks. Years of austerity are now being followed by a catastrophic cost-of-living crisis. None of that was caused by woke ideas. Instead, the west has been divided by politicians playing fast and loose with democracy, undermining the validity of elections, refusing to take responsibility for their actions and widening the divisions between people through racist tropes. Politicians have weakened European institutions, either by undermining Nato (as Donald Trump did) or Europe itself (as the populists have done). The woke are not undermining the west. They are seeking to ensure that all are represented and have a place in society. Decolonising the curriculum is about telling a more complete picture, ensuring that everyone sees themselves reflected in a classroom and that we do not hide from the past. Spoiler alert: the empire was brutal, cruel and exploitative. It involved slavery, murder and the stealing of land and resources from other people. Perhaps understanding the past and ensuring all are represented will bring greater unity rather than the divisions Dowden claims.Prof Andrew MoranSaffron Walden, Essex  Reading Marina Hyde (You can’t erase history.

2/22/2022,"The Queen is expected to speak to Boris Johnson on Wednesday for her regular weekly update from the prime minister as she continues to recover from Covid-19. Audiences with foreign ambassadors are expected to go ahead – also on a virtual basis – as the monarch remains in self-isolation at her home in Windsor.  A day after testing positive for the virus – which Buckingham Palace said on Sunday was manifesting itself in the form of “mild cold-like symptoms” – the Queen was still undertaking light duties in her capacity as head of state. Messages of goodwill continued to roll in from in the UK and overseas, while Boris Johnson told MPs in parliament that the Queen’s positive test was a reminder that the virus “has not gone away”. Her work on Monday included sending condolences to the people of Brazil after flooding in the city of Petrópolis. “I am deeply saddened to hear of the tragic loss of life and destruction caused by the terrible floods in Brazil,” she wrote in a message posted on the royal family’s official Twitter account. “My thoughts and prayers are with all those who have lost their lives, loved ones and homes, as well as the emergency services and all those working to support the recovery efforts.” But while the Queen’s conversation with the prime minister on Wednesday will not take place face to face, campaigners and advocates for elderly people said that many of those among a cohort of more than 1.3 million people who continued to work over the age of 65 included some in public-facing roles who had no choice but to keep on working. The relaxation of Covid restrictions and the ending of self-isolation was a source of worry for many people aged 65 and over, said Morgan Vine, head of policy and influencing at Independent Age. “We are concerned that this sudden change in direction of public safety is likely to increase anxiety among older people, and even cause some to shield themselves and limit daily activities.” The charity added that recent research – between 9 and 13 February – had shown that the challenges faced by those in later life due to the pandemic had worsened many people’s mental health. “If the requirement to isolate is removed, this fear is likely to increase alongside the likelihood of coming into contact with someone who has Covid,” said Vine, speaking a few hours before Johnson’s announcement that the requirement to self-isolate after testing positive in England would end on Thursday. Concerns that many in the older population were deeply anxious about making a transition back to a more normal way of life were also echoed by the UK’s largest charity for older people, Age UK. Ruth Isden, head of health and care influencing at Age UK, said it was going to take time and effort to reassure people and that it was important that government messaging carefully explained the next steps when it came to elderly people and the clinically vulnerable. “We are in a very different position, and vaccines have made a huge difference, but it’s important that the government explains and reassures people as it moves forward with its plans. “If you are in an older age group and have had your vaccinations, and then have kept them up to date, then you are in a much better place, but we have to keep on reassuring people, as well as recognising that it’s not just simply a case of how we feel about ourselves. We need to be cautious and careful when it comes to others.” Rowan Hardwood, professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Nottingham, reiterated the message of other experts that those who have been vaccinated and had kept it up to date, at no matter what age, were in a radically different position from anyone who had not had a jab. But he added: “It is important to recognise that the situation with older people can vary much more than other groups. Virtually anyone by the age of 90 is frail, and by frail, we mean vulnerable and prone to deterioration. “If you have contracted the virus and are quite well to the extent that you are managing to do daily activities, then the vaccine will stand you in good stead. That would apply to anyone of any age.”",News/UK news,Queen to speak to PM in weekly update from self-isolation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/queen-to-speak-to-pm-in-weekly-update-from-self-isolation

2/22/2022,"Russian forces are “creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps” in the event of an invasion, according to a letter sent by the US to the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet. Citing “disturbing information recently obtained by the United States” the letter, from the US ambassador to the UN, Bathsheba Crocker, warns that “we have credible information” that target lists have been drawn up by “Russian forces”.  It warns that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would create a “human rights catastrophe” and that further abuses are being planned, which have previously included “targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture”. A few hours later Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said that Russia’s plans for Ukraine were “extremely violent” – and it was necessary to lay out the threat in the letter for the UN. “We also have intelligence to suggest that there will be an even greater form of brutality because this will not simply be some conventional war between two armies. It will be a war waged by Russia on the Ukrainian people, to repress them, crush them, to harm them,” he said. Evidence to back up the US statements is relatively limited. The warnings are part of the wider western strategy to highlight what are believed to be Putin’s intentions towards Ukraine, partly in an attempt to dissuade him from an invasion, and the Crocker’s letter is the latest in a string from western intelligence about the plans the Russian FSB and GRU agencies have for acting in concert with the Russian military. Last week, Foreign Policy reported that US officials had concluded that lists had been drawn up containing anybody that it believed could challenge Russia, and reported similar conclusions were being drawn by the UK and other anglophone Five Eyes intelligence partners. Britain has made more measured warnings. Earlier this month it emerged that the UK believed that the FSB has been given the task of engineering coups in Ukraine’s major cities in the immediate aftermath of any invasion. The broader plan would see Russian forces would encircle Kyiv and other major cities, leaving the spy agency the task of delivering them, as part of a strategy of “regime change” across Ukraine. Crocker, in her letter, says she was writing to the UN high commissioner for human rights because of its mandate and its presence in Ukraine. The letter states that those most likely to be targeted include “Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, and vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons”. The letter emerged after the latest flurry of diplomacy, which saw Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin approve in principle the idea of a summit between the two leaders, aimed at de-escalating the Ukraine crisis. The step – conditional on Russia not invading Ukraine – was taken with the help of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after calls on Sunday night with the two leaders. A format for the summit is to be decided at a meeting between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday. Further details also emerged of US sanctions plans, with Reuters reporting that the US intends to bar US financial institutions from processions transactions for major Russian banks in the event of an invasion. The report, which cites three sources, said the measures aim to hurt the Russian economy by cutting the “correspondent” banking relationships between targeted Russian banks and US banks that enable international payments.

2/22/2022,"The mottled ice at Curl Edinburgh was thronged with players, as competitors in a ladies’ league gracefully lunged forwards with their curling stones, arms and legs out-stretched. Teammates busily swept hard at the ice, to help the granite gain an extra few millimetres of ground. Mondays are often busy at Edinburgh’s only curling centre. But this Monday has been transformed by Team GB’s gold and silver medal triumphs at the winter Olympics. Two of the medal-winners play there, as do previous Olympic and world champions.  Aaron Forsyth, the rink’s manager, said the centre had been inundated with inquiries about the sport since the victories in Beijing. “We’ve received hundreds of emails or clicks in the last few days where people have asked to try curling,” he said. “It’s fantastic.” Part of the challenge, Forsyth said, could be accommodating them all, and particularly supporting the younger children whose interest in the game has been sparked. Guiding those 20kg (44lb) stones down the ice takes greater strength than it may seem. He believes curling is the UK’s dominant winter Olympics discipline. Team GB’s modest medal rush came late in the games and entirely from curling. After the frustrations of the mixed team coming fourth, the men’s team took silver on Saturday and then the women’s team comprehensively defeated Japan 10-3 in Sunday’s final. And Curl Edinburgh is perhaps one of the sport’s most successful venues. Open more than 12 hours a day to numerous clubs and leagues, its players drawn from the city’s banks, doctors, local teams and from nearby towns such as Peebles, it is also a popular venue for holidaymakers. Seen in the UK as an archetypally Scottish sport, Forsyth hosts school parties from England, companies from London organising staff awaydays, and large groups of friends visiting Edinburgh for stag and hen parties. “The Olympics is going to add to this,” he said. “The goal is to keep the momentum going.” Those medals could not have come at a better time, said Maggie Wilson of Scottish Curling. The organisation hopes it will produce a rise in interest from new, younger players. “The Olympics has shown how exciting it is, and really entertaining for all the ages,” Wilson said, citing the women team’s nerve-racking victory over Sweden in the semi-finals. One of the game’s youngest ambassadors is Jamie Rankin, an 18-year-old student from a curling dynasty. His mother, Janice Rankin, was part of Great Britain’s gold medal-winning team at the Salt Lake City winter games in 2002; his grandmother Barbara was playing in a league competition at Curl Edinburgh on Monday morning while he worked part-time in its cafe upstairs. Rankin, a business student originally from Elgin, coaches Edinburgh University’s curling team. And he is “100%” clear about his ambition. “I want to go to the Olympics one day. That’s what I’m working towards, definitely.” He believes the sport will attract younger competitors. At home in Elgin, the local youth team was 25 to 30 strong. “I have got a couple of my friends watching it, and they’re always messaging me, saying, ‘Why are they doing this?’ or ‘What does that mean?’ I’m going to get them to come along.” The sport has had a difficult pandemic. It is chiefly played in the winter and almost entirely on indoor rinks. And even though Team GB’s medal winners are in their 20s and 30s, most of curling’s active players are middle-aged or older. Scotland’s rinks were closed by lockdowns over the winter of 2020-21, and again in October last year, just three weeks after the season began. Older players were reluctant to congregate in indoor venues, and many drifted away. Scottish Curling estimates that about a tenth of its 10,000 members gave up the sport during the Covid crisis. The sport’s greatest challenge, Wilson said, is keeping its youth players involved in the sport once they leave home for university or their first full-time job. Then the participation rates take a steep dive. Dave Leith, the head of performance support with British Curling, the sport’s competition organisation, said: “It’s quite a big challenge. We’ve already started to crack that nut to some degree because we’ve got a lot of strength in depth now, in a way I don’t think we’ve seen for quite some time, but there’s still a lot of work to be done there.”",Sport/Sport,Winter Olympics curling triumph draws new generation to the ice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/winter-olympics-curling-triumph-draws-new-generation-to-the-ice
2/22/2022,"Health and the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic are a significant drag on the Coalition vote, with one in three Australians less likely to vote for the Morrison government due to the level of public hospital funding, according to new polling. An Essential poll, commissioned by the Australian Medical Association, found voters who had traditionally supported the Coalition on health and hospital funding were now deserting them. Support in this key area had dropped, with 34% now questioning the government’s record.  Only the Morrison government’s handling of the climate crisis and cost of living pressures registered greater levels of disapproval. Of those polled, 37% were less likely to vote for the government on climate, while 38% were not supportive of Morrison on cost of living. The poll of 1,069 voters was conducted from 3 to 6 February, before a torrid parliamentary fortnight in which the Morrison government dropped its religious discrimination bill and pivoted to national security to recover its poor standing in the polls. On Friday states and territories reiterated their demand for the commonwealth to provide 50% of public hospital funding, up from 45%, and abandon a 6.5% growth cap on health funding. States believe the cost-sharing deal struck during the Covid-19 pandemic is not fit-for-purpose now coronavirus is circulating in the community, as it does not keep up with increased staffing costs, PPE and expected new demand from delayed care and long-Covid. Despite the pressure from the states in the lead-up to the 2022 election, the AMA is yet to secure a commitment from either side of politics for 50-50 funding, with Labor more focused on GP and specialist out-of-pocket costs. Anthony Albanese has promised Labor will “always be better” on health, signalling higher levels of funding, but is yet to announce its full policy. Coalition voters still approved of the Morrison government’s handling of hospitals, with 29% saying it made them more likely to support the government and 19% less likely. But the issue is biting among voters aged 55 and over, 19% more of who said they’d be less likely to vote Coalition, and non-major party voters, 37% more of who said they’d be less likely to vote Coalition. The AMA’s Clear the Hospital Logjam campaign argues that the public hospital system was struggling before Covid-19, but now faces blowouts in ambulances ramping, emergency departments at capacity, and long waits for essential surgery. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said the results “put the political parties on notice that public hospital funding is resonating as a vote-changer with the Australian electorate”. “The distressing picture we are getting of our hospital funding crisis should be a warning shot to all politicians that they need to pledge they’ll fix public hospital funding if elected,” he said. In October the Morrison government dismissed calls for more hospital funding as a form of “shakedown politics”, targeting the Queensland premier in particular despite the bipartisan call from Labor and Liberal premiers. The Queensland health minister, Yvette D’Ath, told Guardian Australia “Queensland’s position is unchanged – we’re calling for long-term sustainable health funding from the commonwealth”. In addition to 50-50 funding, it wants “an extension of the current financial arrangements in the fight against Covid because the challenge the pandemic poses to Queensland is ongoing”, she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The Morrison government needs to start taking its health responsibilities far more seriously. “This includes providing aged care packages to the more than 500 Queenslanders who are currently in Queensland public hospital beds.” The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the health system “is under extreme pressure and the current funding arrangement with the commonwealth, where the states pay more, is unfair and unsustainable”. “The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on everything from primary health care in the community to our hospitals will mean states will be carrying the impact of this one-in-100-year event for many years to come.” The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, has again rejected calls for more funding, citing the federal contribution to health growing by 92% between 2012-13 and 2020-21, compared with state increases of 44%. “There is nothing stopping the states and territories matching the Australian government investment in public hospitals, and if they did, hospitals would be adequately funded,” a spokesperson for Hunt said. The Essential poll showed the Coalition was also losing votes on economic management and online safety.",News/Australia news,Poll shows hit to Coalition vote over Covid handling and health funding,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/poll-shows-hit-to-coalition-vote-over-covid-handling-and-health-funding
2/22/2022,"First the interview, now the invisibility. Romelu Lukaku has mostly been a conundrum since returning to Chelsea last summer and while the £97.5m striker has not done much talking off the pitch since that ill-advised chat with Sky Italia at the end of December, nothing summed up his struggles more than when he produced a performance of record-breaking anonymity against Crystal Palace last Saturday. This was Lukaku at his most laboured, predictable and disconnected from his teammates. He touched the ball a grand total of seven times, the fewest in 90 minutes of Premier League football for any player since Opta began keeping track in 2003, and nobody was about to argue he was merely keeping his powder dry for the big moments.  Even Thomas Tuchel, who desperately needs the Belgian to find form, is not putting a positive spin on the numbers. Chelsea’s manager understands their significance and he was unsure whether he can help Lukaku by tweaking his tactical approach when the European champions host Lille in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday night. “What can I do?” Tuchel said. “I don’t know. We have to deal with it. The data is out there and the data speaks a certain language. He was not involved in our game. It’s not what we want or Romelu wants, but it’s not the time to laugh and make jokes about him. He’s in the spotlight and we’ll protect him.” It did not sound as if the mood is going to become cheerier in the near future. True, Lukaku scored twice when Chelsea won the Club World Cup this month. Yes, he should fancy his chances of hurting Lille given the French champions are floundering this season. But no, it would not be a great surprise if it turns out to be another evening of Lukaku waiting in vain for quick balls to be slid down the channels, his teammates ignoring his prompts and Tuchel despairing at his marquee signing looking so out of place. This was not part of the plan when Chelsea bought Lukaku. The 28-year-old had just fired Internazionale to the Serie A title and it seemed he was going to prove similarly inspirational in Chelsea’s attempt to challenge Manchester City and Liverpool. Lukaku was looking an uneasy fit even before an ankle injury further disrupted his momentum in October. An immobile presence, he does not make it easy for Chelsea to attack with fluidity. Increasingly, there is a sense of Tuchel compromising his beliefs by sculpting everything around a target man and the problem is exacerbated by Chelsea’s reluctance to play to Lukaku’s strengths, often leaving him frustrated by opting for a controlled buildup. Nobody is adapting. It is not simply down to Lukaku. Kai Havertz, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Christian Pulisic and Timo Werner are not providing for him and do not score enough. Mason Mount, who is unlikely to return from an ankle injury until Chelsea face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday, has had a stop-start campaign and Hakim Ziyech remains inconsistent despite chipping in with some important goals. In that context it is no wonder Chelsea remain a cup team rather than one capable of challenging for the title. They do not create or shoot as much as City and Liverpool, raising questions over whether the tactics are too restrictive. “Maybe,” Tuchel said. “There is a history of strikers struggling at Chelsea so it is not the easiest place in the world for strikers. I don’t know exactly why. We want to be a hard-working group that is not shy to make it physical and not only a skilful game.” For Lille, that was a reminder that Chelsea still know how to play a cup tie. They conceded twice in the knockout stages of the Champions League last season and their defensive prowess will make them contenders again. Chelsea are dangerous in these situations, but they cannot merely rely on their defence. They are weaker on the left without Ben Chilwell and although Reece James is close to a return on the right, contractual uncertainty hangs over three key players. César Azpilicueta could join Barcelona at the end of the season, talks with Andreas Christensen have broken down and Antonio Rüdiger is yet to sign an extension despite being offered about £170,000 a week. Gaps have appeared, gaps that would be easier to hide if the attack begins to function. Ultimately, Tuchel knows he can trust his defenders. The questions are at the other end and the focus has to be on Lukaku somehow developing an understanding with his fellow forwards. They have to accept more responsibility and Tuchel has to give them a spark. A £97.5m striker having seven touches a game is unsustainable and unless something changes, it is hard to see Chelsea holding on to their European crown.",Sport/Football,Lukaku’s unwanted record is cause for concern in Chelsea’s trophy chase | Jacob Steinberg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/21/lukakus-unwanted-record-is-cause-for-concern-in-chelseas-trophy-chase
2/22/2022,"Asda is facing potential disruption to supermarket deliveries after thousands of lorry drivers, warehouse staff and clerical workers voted to reject a pay offer. Almost 70% of the GMB union’s 8,000 members within Asda’s distribution network, which employs 12,000 in total, voted to reject pay rises of between 5% and 7.5%.  That pay rise compares to inflation of 7.8% – on the retail price index measure – while the legal minimum wage is set to increase by 6.6% in April. The government’s preferred measure of inflation – the consumer prices index – is expected to rise from 5.5% in January to almost 8% in April. Almost 80% of those balloted said they were ready to take action over the pay deal, raising the prospect of strikes that would affect all 23 distribution depots serving the UK’s third largest supermarket chain. Nadine Houghton, a national officer for the GMB, said: “The UK is facing the worst cost of living crisis for a generation. Inflation is rampant and energy prices are out of control. “Yet Asda workers are being taken for mugs with a below-inflation pay offer that basically means a real-terms pay cut. “They’re not going to take it lying down – it’s now up to Asda bosses to come back with a reasonable offer and avert the threat of industrial action.” Jon Parry, the vice-president of Asda Logistics Services, said: “We value the key role our colleagues play to keep our stores well stocked, and we have negotiated in good faith with the GMB to make a fair, competitive and sustainable pay offer that recognises rising inflation. We are disappointed this has been rejected.” Asda said it expected the GMB to honour a national recognition agreement under which the next step would be a meeting between the union, the supermarket and the conciliation service Acas. Asda is the latest major business to face potential industrial action over pay as shortages of workers, particularly those qualified to drive large lorries, empowers those in relatively low-paid work. The supermarket was forced join rivals in offering signing-on fees of as much as £1,000 last year as a combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit reduced access to suitable staff. The average hourly rate for Asda distribution workers is currently £15.07 for a driver and £13.09 for a warehouse worker. Before Christmas, Tesco avoided threatened strike action by the Usdaw and Unite unions, which would have affected about 13 of its 22 distribution centres, after offering an improved pay deal. Drivers were offered a 5.5% rise backdated to July and a further 0.5% from the end of February this year. Drivers at the courier group Yodel, which works with some of the UK’s biggest retailers, including Marks & Spencer and Aldi, also won a pay rise to £16 an hour after a threat of strike action by GMB members. A further strike by Unite members at Tesco’s Booker wholesale business planned before Christmas was suspended pending a pay review. It is understood talks are continuing.",News/Business,Thousands of Asda lorry drivers ready to strike after rejecting pay deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/thousands-of-asda-lorry-drivers-ready-to-strike-after-rejecting-pay-deal
2/22/2022,"A former Post Office worker has recounted how she pleaded guilty on the day of her daughter’s birthday, while another was sentenced as her granddaughter was born, in a day of harrowing testimony of victims wrongly prosecuted for stealing in the Horizon IT scandal. Siobhan Sayer, 54, told a public inquiry on Monday that she was barred from seeing her distressed six-month-old daughter as investigators visited her home in 2008 seeking £18,000 in funds missing from her Post Office business.  “They came in, asked if they could search the property and I said I had no issue as I had nothing to hide,” she said. “They went through kitchen draws, the filing cabinet [and] tipped my underwear drawer upside down while joking about where I hid the money, saying it would be much easier if I told them where it was. I was humiliated, terrified. I had a six-month-old daughter. I wasn’t allowed to see her. She started crying and I wasn’t allowed to leave to go and see her. That ended me. I had to end the interview as I couldn’t continue any longer.” Sayer said that during the lengthy investigation she felt “generally harassed and intimidated”, including regularly finding someone parked outside her house. Ultimately, on the advice of lawyers, she pleaded guilty to charges of false accounting in 2010 – on the day of her daughter’s birthday. “I went to court that morning thinking I wouldn’t be coming home,” said the mother-of-four. “Thinking it would be left to Dad to discuss [my incarceration] with them. I was advised I would receive a custodial sentence. I went to court that day with a case packed not knowing if I would be coming home.” Pauline Thompson, 72, also recalled being told by lawyers to “pack a bag” on the day the judge handed down her sentence, although she too ultimately avoided jail. She had already endured being arrested in the heart of her village, being held in a cell and having her DNA and fingerprints taken. “I had to sell the local newspaper [in the Post Office] with my face all over the front page,” she said. “The day I was sentenced my daughter gave birth to my granddaughter. The judge was very kind, he realised I was in a dark place and finished by saying ‘go and enjoy your first grandchild’. I felt that was taken away from me as I couldn’t enjoy her pregnancy. My lawyer had told me to pack a bag. I felt quite ill. Pack a bag, what do you pack?” In a day of emotional hearings, victims recounted similar stories of the huge toll on more than 700 Post Office operators wrongly prosecuted for theft and false accounting between 2000 and 2014 due to a flawed IT system suggesting financial shortfalls. “I got tarred overnight,” said Timothy Burgess, who remembers noticing shortfalls the very first day the IT system was installed. “People ignored me, crossed the street. People were hostile. I killed the village, I had that levelled at me.” Burgess’s relationship with his daughter “deteriorated quite a bit” and even a shift to a new school 30 miles away “was not far enough” to avoid the scandal. An attempt by his sister-in-law to buy the village pet store, something she “had her heart set on”, was thwarted by the owner because of the association with Burgess.

It was terrible to tell a young child.” While ultimately Adedayo did not go to jail – the judge took into consideration her young family and that she had started to pay the Post Office back – the years of being considered guilty wreaked an enormous emotional and financial cost. “All of a sudden I was a thief: they wrote it on the wall,” she said. “I wanted to die, I really did. I would go shopping at night, [my children] missed out on socialising as well. If anyone invited them to, say, a birthday party I would make excuses to say no because I couldn’t face anyone. I couldn’t go to the school gates to meet them because I was ashamed. Everything I ever worked for went down the pan overnight.

2/22/2022,"A 24-year-old English teacher developed a chronic gambling addiction that started with betting small amounts on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) when he was in the sixth form, an inquest into his death has heard. Jack Ritchie, a Hull university history graduate, took his own life while teaching English in Hanoi, Vietnam, in November 2017.  His parents, Charles and Liz Ritchie, from Sheffield, argue that government failures contributed to their son’s death in that he was hooked on “products licensed by the state”. The inquest examining Ritchie’s death is believed by his parents to be the first so-called article 2 inquest in a case relating to suicide after gambling. That means its scope will include an examination of whether any arm of the state breached its duty to protect their son’s right to life. On Monday, the opening day, a witness statement from Ritchie’s childhood friend Nick Clough was read. He described going with Ritchie to betting shops when they were aged 16 or 17 and spending small amounts on the machines. Ritchie’s intention was to double his money “to get a free lunch”. But he added: “With Jack it became more than that.” A trigger moment was when Ritchie won £1,000 in less than 30 seconds, a win that changed his attitude to gambling as he began chasing his losses and looking for the big win. Other witness evidence read to the inquest described how no one had realised the extent of Ritchie’s problems until he had taken his own life. Forensic evidence presented to the inquest showed he was a regular visitor to the BetVictor online gambling website in the days leading up to his death. The inquest at Sheffield town hall opened with a video montage of happy moments from Ritchie’s life. His father described him as a “fine young man on the threshold of his life” who “brightened the lives of everyone around him”. Charles and Liz Ritchie have campaigned for reform of gambling legislation through a charity, Gambling With Lives, that they helped set up. The couple believe an undiagnosed gambling disorder lay behind their son’s death and argue there were no public health warnings about the risk to life posed by gambling products. Their son was not diagnosed or offered treatment that linked his symptoms to gambling disorder, they say. The coroner David Urpeth said the evidence at the hearing, expected to last two weeks, would cover topics including what information was available to Ritchie and his family about the risks of gambling and also what medical treatment was available to him. Urpeth said that his examination of how Ritchie died would include “whether gambling caused or contributed to his death”. The coroner said he understood that the family wanted the scope of the inquest to be an even wider analysis of government gambling policy and told them: “I do not want the family to think I am disinterested in their wider concerns. It’s just that such concerns are beyond the power invested in me.” Officials from the Gambling Commission and the Department of Health and Social Care and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport are among those expected to give evidence at the inquest. Charles Ritchie previously told the Guardian that he had discovered his son’s addiction when he was 18. He promptly took him into every betting shop in Sheffield, where Jack Ritchie left a photograph and signed a form that would exclude him from placing bets there. But his addiction simply transferred online. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2/22/2022,"Eleven villagers were enough to bring down a giant, so it goes. On the day the 1958 World Cup final was played in Solna, another game took place 2,200 miles south, which wasn’t where they wanted it but that made it better in the end.  Athletic Club de Bilbao – Atlético then, by dictatorial decree – had requested the final of the Copa del Generalísimo be held in a neutral city, but the Generalísimo wasn’t going anywhere which meant that nor were they. At best, they were told, Spain’s showpiece game could be moved to the Metropolitano so they said let’s stick to the Santiago Bernabéu. That way, more of their fans would get in to see them win it. Which was pretty bold, a bilbainada – a song and a mindset, a declaration of invincibility all the better if it’s against the odds. They followed through on it. In front of 125,000, it finished 2-0 against that Real Madrid in their own home, a month after Paco Gento’s goal had given them the third of five consecutive European Cups. Once aldeanos – 11 villagers, an entire lineup of locals – had done over the world’s side, Athletic’s president Enrique Guzmán declared, the name of a team and the identity of a club expressed in a line that lasted. On Sunday night, footage from the 1958 final was broadcast on the screens at San Mamés before the Basque derby against Real Sociedad, in honour of Mauricio Ugartemendia Lauzirika. Born in Gernika, an Athletic midfielder for 11 years, making 295 appearances and getting 72 goals, scorer of the second in that final that would define them, the man who ran Bar Poxpolin after he retired, “Mauri” had passed away two days earlier, aged 87. The club’s anthem was played on the piano accompanied by silence from the stands, the teams lined up wearing black bands. And then, when it finished, Athletic’s players paid him tribute by beating Real Sociedad 4-0 despite missing a penalty. Athletic hadn’t scored four against la Real in 45 years – and the last time they had won a derby by four goals, Mauri was still playing. Legend has it that when the captain Piru Gaínza collected the cup in 1958 he turned to Franco and said: “See you next year.” Actually, he didn’t, but the Once Aldeanos – Carmelo, Orúe, Garay, Canito, Mauri, Etura, Artetxe, Uribe, Arieta, Aguirre, Gaínza – were some team: league winners in 1956, cup winners in 1955 and 56, they defeated Honved and beat the Busby Babes 5-3 in 1957 (although, down to 10 men, they lost the second leg at Old Trafford), before winning that final against Di Stéfano’s European champions. The following season, Mauri scored a hat-trick against Celta during a run in which Athletic won 9-0, 9-0, 8-1 and 7-0 in a row. The year after, they scored six against Oviedo, five against Atlético, four against Barcelona. And beat Real Sociedad 4-0 at San Mamés. Dani Vivian heads in the opener in the Basque Derby! 🔥San Mames erupts as Athletic Club take the lead 🦁 pic.twitter.com/6bQNWq1cYv Times have changed, though, and it didn’t happen again. It didn’t look much like it was going to happen this time, either. “Strip away all the paraphernalia that surrounds a derby and what you’re left with is an unsmokeable chestnut,” claimed El Correo Vasco. Rubbish, in other words. That was only a half-truth: the paraphernalia is part of the point, maybe even the whole point. Football without feeling is worthless and there may be no game anywhere with the depth of identity that this derby has, the culture, the pull of history and the connection to its community on both sides. There’s no meeting more local and there certainly isn’t anywhere you would see blue and white shirts spread around red and white stands even on a night when no away tickets have officially been sold. The games are often fun, with something enjoyable in the different styles within a context where much is shared. This wasn’t bad either, yet there was something in that comment, certainly in the first half. There wasn’t much football and, although Raúl García managed to get a yellow card after four minutes, there weren’t even that many fouls: nine each in the 90 minutes. There was not much blood, not much thunder, and in the first 45 minutes there weren’t any goals. Not least because Álex Remiro, the former Athletic goalkeeper who was whistled and chanted at throughout, whose mistake cost la Real the last derby, saved an Iker Muniain penalty, earning temporary revenge and two kilos of beef from a local radio station. But, the Athletic coach Marcelino García Toral insisted, the fact that Athletic didn’t disappear from the game after that, that they “never got demoralised”, was “supremely important”. And then suddenly, midway through the second half, it exploded. The Athletic striker Iñaki Williams talked afterwards about how he loved and had missed that feeling that “every corner is a goal [and] teams fear us”. The sporting director, Rafael Alkorta, conjured up the combination of expectation and excellent delivery, big men with granite foreheads waiting for the ball, referring to corners as “half a goal”, and if that wasn’t quite right either it wasn’t so far off. They’re better than penalties, anyway. Athletic have scored two of seven spot kicks, Muniain becoming the third player to miss; on Sunday night, by contrast, from corners they scored two from six. And then, liberated, launched into their opponents. Dani Vivian headed in the first corner on 68 minutes. Less than four minutes later Oihan Sancet volleyed in the second. He had only been on the pitch 10 minutes but he changed the game completely, scoring the second, leading the move for a superb third, finished by Williams, and assisting Muniain’s fourth. It all happened so fast that la Real didn’t have time to work out what was going on, and nor did anyone else. They had played in Europe on Thursday night, arriving back on Friday, and although the midfielder Martín Zubimendi insisted “that’s no excuse: we can’t let ourselves go after letting in one goal”, their physical condition probably played a part. Athletic’s certainly did: no team produce as many high-intensity runs, flying around the field. Williams was unstoppable, right side and left, every surge in step with the stands, like they were the ones pressing the accelerator. “It’s easier when you go hand in hand with the fans,” he said. Suddenly, they were coming from everywhere. In 19 minutes, Athletic scored four, the noise rolling round. By the final minute, the olés were too. “A perfect night,” the Correo Vasco called it. “A merciless destruction,” AS said. “What a tearing apart,” Marca declared. The Real Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil said: “I’m the one to blame and that’s it, full stop.” Marcelino beamed: “I’m proud of my players for letting me experience the joy of another magical night at San Mamés.” Elche 2-1 Rayo VallecanoReal Madrid 3-0 AlavésCádiz 1-1 GetafeOsasuna 0-3 Atlético MadridGranada 1-4 VillarrealAthletic Bilbao 4-0 Real SociedadReal Betis 2-1 Real MallorcaValencia 1-4 BarcelonaEspanyol 1-1 Sevilla Another was the word. There’s something childlike, almost sweetly disbelieving about Marcelino’s smile, there again on Sunday night, and it has been seen a lot lately: in the past month alone, Athletic have beaten Madrid, Atlético and Barcelona and have now scored four against Real Sociedad, their first derby win in five taking them to within a point of their rivals and just two from a European place. Level at 1-1, they also have the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final to come, having knocked out Barcelona and Madrid. The last time Athletic scored four against Real Sociedad, in 1977 in a 4-2 win, it was two months and one day before they played a cup final against Betis. Sunday night was two months and three days before another cup final. They meet Valencia in one semi-final; Betis lead Rayo in the other. If Athletic get through, that would be three consecutive finals, plus two Super Cup finals, one of which they won against Lionel Messi’s Barcelona having beaten Madrid to get there. Marcelino meanwhile is 90 minutes away from reaching his fourth in a row, having won it with Valencia before joining Athletic (where his first was inherited from Gaizka Garitano). Omens have a habit of ending up empty, they will never get back that fortnight when they lost cup finals against Real Sociedad and Barcelona, and there’s a hint of desperation, a need to take this one last step, but to have got this far is an achievement, like something from another time. And, as Marcelino insisted, “it’s not chance”. This may not be Once Aldeanos exactly, but it doesn’t get much closer these days: every player in the Athletic squad was born less than 100 miles from San Mamés, where they turned Sunday night’s derby into a homage to Mauricio Ugartemendia Lauzirika and all those men who came before them.",Sport/Football,Athletic Bilbao summon spirit of Once Aldeanos in Basque derby triumph,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/21/athletic-bilbao-summon-spirit-of-once-aldeanos-in-basque-derby-triumph
2/22/2022,"Boris Johnson’s use of apocalyptic demons to aid his survival in office knows no limit. Since his near-death experience of “partygate”, he has shamelessly exploited war, floods and pestilence. All have responded. Pestilence is now his greatest ally. The decision announced today to end all remaining pandemic restriction measures in England goes flatly against his more cautious advisers and appears highly political. That does not make it wrong. The prime duty of government is to protect people from death and disease. After two years of Covid, the most basic measure of that protection is the “excess death rate” from all causes. In England this is now negative, that is, running below the seasonal norm, while Covid-related hospitalisations across the entire UK are falling fast. The crisis is over. Were Covid not in the air, mass testing for, say, infectious flu would seem an excessive precaution, given the government’s claims that it costs an astronomical £2bn a month. Whether this continues apparently remains a matter of argument.  It is true that excess deaths also fell a year ago before the return of Covid via the Omicron variant, a return not remotely as serious as previous variants. It was countered by the clearly effective remedy of vaccination. Nonetheless, the return was enough for “the science” to challenge Johnson’s decision to end quarantine requirements and scale back mass testing. He is determined to “return to normal” after two years of national disruption, leaving individuals and organisations to make their own judgments on caution, as with other diseases. Yes, he says, it is a risk, but his job is to judge risks, and sometimes to take them. In this case Johnson is surely right. Leaving aside vaccination – unquestioned hero of the hour – the external cost of the Covid lockdown has been unquantifiable but appalling. In medicine alone, cancers have gone unreported, with other illnesses untreated and mental health neglected. The money spent on lockdown compensation, much of it reckless and some even corrupt, has been denied to other welfare uses. The cost to child welfare is inestimable, as has been the cost to education. It is, of course, possible that ending mandatory self-isolation may lead to another upturn, though whether this should justify a return of lockdown must be doubted. Support for the clinically vulnerable should remain, and be shored up with new resources. More to the point is that the government – and the country – should now be able to turn its resources and attention to recovering from Covid’s wider damage to the nation’s welfare caused over the past two years. It is worrying how rarely those pleading for continued lockdown refer to this damage. It is as if because a cost is unquantifiable in the short term it does not exist. Too often scientists sound like just another interest group out to protect its reputation and budget. As Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College London modelling group were quoted as admitting: “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression.” It is why Sweden’s decision to avoid a draconian lockdown merits serious analysis. Its GDP fell by 2.9%, Britain’s by 9.4%. In the European league tables Sweden falls around the middle in deaths per capita, still well below Britain. Experts should be on tap, not on top. They should be listened to but not obeyed. We vote for politicians to rule us and no one else, thank goodness. Now Johnson can get back to his other demons, still dancing attendance at his door.

2/22/2022,"In 2006, the first uploads appeared on Jamal Edwards’ YouTube channel SBTV. On grainy footage, young MCs dart in and out of the camera, spraying bars into the lens, old school grime instrumentals playing on loop in the background. These rough cuts were a symbol of what was to come for a man and a generation of MCs emerging out of working-class corners of the UK. At a time when genres such as grime and rap had been barred from the stages of British mainstream music, and were largely absent from charts and radio, award shows and TV, Edwards and SBTV became a refuge and a haven for young MCs seeking an outlet. Edwards was a conductor and a vessel, embodying the culture’s DIY essence, and allowing adolescent expression to find voice on the newly levelled terrain of YouTube.  The channel raised generations of musicians. Known as Smokey Barz back then, it launched soon after YouTube itself. What started as Edwards filming local friends with double lives as MCs became a hub and a meeting point for an entire scene. In the first 10 years of its life, the channel ran music videos, interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. But its showcase pieces were its freestyle sessions, the most popular of which were F64 and Warm Up Sessions. Over the years, the sound’s most popular and most cherished artists have graced those sessions: from respected veterans such as Boy Better Know and Akala, Margs and Black the Ripper, NoLay and Skinnyman, then staggering down the generations, featuring rising stars Dave and J Hus in 2015, and a standout Warm Up Session from Big Zuu in 2016. When it came to the freestyles, Jamal was deep in the weeds – even once the channel had grown to over a million subscribers, and he had helped launch the careers of mammoth pop stars such as Ed Sheeran, Jessie J and Jess Glynne, and he had been given an MBE for services to music in 2014. Many MCs and musicians such as the late MC Cadet recount stories of how he would tell them to rewrite their lyrics, pushing them to go deeper, asking them to bring who they are, the conditions that shaped them, on to their records. The result is vital collection of British music. The channel, still running, is a time capsule and a snapshot of contemporary sound in Britain. Through its videos you can trace the evolution of music in Black Britain, grime moving into UK rap, then both bleeding into Afroswing and UK drill. Its essence and meaning to the community from which it sprang is best captured in a Warm Up Session by Birmingham grime pioneer Vader, who raps: “Big up Jamal, best wishes … keep showing the world the best of the British.” But the legacy of Edwards is not consigned to artists and MCs alone. There are generations of creatives who have passed through the revolving doors of his company. I worked at SBTV for about 15 months, stretching from 2016 to 2018, working across editorial and YouTube, searching for my break in a media industry that seemed sealed at the doors. In SBTV I found a space to deepen my craft. I found encouragement, connections and deep friendships that carry on to this day. In that experience I was not alone. There are a string of creatives and photographers, media personalities and directors, who Edwards has given a leg up. “That to me is the most important thing,” he said in an interview, “because that’s what I got into it for, being able to help get these artists get to the next level.” When Jay-Z was seeking to get in touch with talented rapper turned director Rapman, it was Edwards who linked the two. The result was Rapman signing to Roc Nation, and the eventual release of his successful cult film Blue Story. Many across the country have similar stories to tell. Sitting in the office, you would often hear stories of young creatives seeking Edwards out for advice, photographers who had stopped him on the street, asked for an opportunity to work and within a few weeks were shooting and creating content for brands and the SBTV Instagram. He was a dreamer who reached out and grabbed his future. And when he found success, he encouraged and inspired a wave of watching kids to do the same. “Everyone has the potential in them,” he once said in an interview with Ross Kemp, “it’s just at what point in your life you unlock it.” In the hours since he died aged 31, social media has been awash with stories of his generosity from music executives and media personalities, producers and writers who he laid out a bridge for, a connection between his community and industries that had long resisted them. This work to uplift and encourage goes beyond music. In recent years Edwards had launched JE Delve, a youth charity in Ealing, London, dedicated to giving young people the opportunity to develop skills in fields from film-making to architecture, continuing his devotion to nurturing talent emerging out of the edges. The same boy who picked up a camera and changed the fortunes of himself and hundreds of others more than decade back retained the same focus and intent as a grown man. In a year where rap and Black music in Britain continues to scale new heights, now with its own official category at the Brits, producing some of the highest-selling artists in the country, Jamal Edwards’ contribution cannot be understated or forgotten. He was a pioneer who laid the ground for those who came after, carved a door out of the ether and beckoned his people, his community, his friends and even strangers to walk through it.",Arts/Music,Jamal Edwards: a pioneer of British music whose generosity paved the way for generations,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/21/jamal-edwards-a-pioneer-of-british-music-whose-generosity-paved-the-way-for-generations
2/22/2022,"Free Covid testing will end for the general public in England from 1 April and people with positive cases will no longer legally have to isolate from this Thursday, Boris Johnson has announced. Unveiling his “living with Covid” strategy, the prime minister told the House of Commons it was time for the pandemic response to be wound down and for people to “get our confidence back”.  Johnson emphasised “personal responsibility” for Covid in future, rather than using government restrictions to control it. He said “pharmaceutical interventions”, such as antivirals and vaccines, would be the primary line of defence from now on. In a series of changes, the prime minister said: People will no longer get free PCR and lateral flow tests from 1 April onwards. Some symptomatic people who are elderly or vulnerable will still be able to get free lateral flow tests, but the age limit for this has not yet been decided: the government said it would be restricted to a “small number of at-risk groups” and care home staff. The legal requirement to isolate after testing positive, and for contacts to isolate or test, will end on Thursday – although people will be advised to do so until April. After that, it will be a matter of personal choice. Contact tracing and Covid support payments for the low paid will end from Thursday, at the same time as the legal requirement to isolate. Schools and other education settings will no longer be advised to test twice-weekly, with immediate effect. Changes to statutory sick pay brought in during the pandemic will be scrapped from 24 February, meaning people will only be able to claim it from day four rather than day one. NHS and social care staff will no longer get asymptomatic testing but it is expected patients and care home residentswill see this continue. Guidance on Covid passports will be scrapped from 1 April, with venues no longer recommended to use them. They will still be available for international travel. The announcement of the strategy was overshadowed by a row between Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and Sajid Javid, the health secretary, over the level of continuing funding for testing and surveillance of Covid. A cabinet source said it had been “a comprehensive victory for the Treasury” with funding for testing slashed from an annual £15bn to less than £2bn, with Javid agreeing to reprioritise some of his existing health budget to keep programmes that were under threat. No 10 insisted that the NHS efforts to reduce the waiting list backlog would not be affected. Johnson claimed the Office for National Statistics survey of Covid in the community would be maintained, but it was not clear whether this will be in its current form or a slimmed-down version. The government also insisted that the Vivaldi study on care homes and Panoramic study on antivirals will continue, although it was not clear how they will be funded and whether enough testing is being done to support them. The changes were met with scepticism from Labour, who accused the prime minister of weakening sick pay in a way that will “hit the lowest paid and the most insecure workers the hardest”. He also asked for assurances that the ONS infection survey will not see reduced capacity. The party’s leader, Keir Starmer, said: “We can’t turn off Britain’s radar before the war is won. Ignorance is bliss is not a responsible approach to a deadly virus. It actually risks undoing all the hard won progress the British people have achieved over the last two years.”",News/World news,Boris Johnson says free Covid tests in England will end on 1 April ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/boris-johnson-says-free-covid-tests-in-england-will-end-on-1-april

2/22/2022,"When you are searching online for some of the remotest islands on the planet, it helps to get the name right. But a row has broken out over the labelling of the Chagos Islands on Google maps. The UK maintains that it still holds sovereignty over what it terms British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) – one of the smallest of red dots on the traditional cartographic globe.  But Mauritius, which has been recognised as legitimate owner of the archipelago in a series of international court judgments and United Nations votes since 2019, has formally asked Google to re-describe the islands as part of its territory. Letters seen by the Guardian have been sent to the search engine’s California headquarters requesting that BIOT, which includes the strategic US military base of Diego Garcia, be wiped off the map. Mauritius first sent a request in January 2020 to Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer at Google. It asked the company to “rectify this error immediately” and included as evidence references to the advisory opinion of the international court of justice in The Hague. The judgment said the UK “unlawfully” detached the Chagos Islands from Mauritius prior to granting it independence in 1968. Mauritius said that an overwhelming majority vote by the United Nations General Assembly adopted the court’s opinion and “demanded that the United Kingdom terminate its unlawful colonial administration”. The letter said the “error could be interpreted as tacit approval … of the UK’s unlawful administration”. The islands, it added, should be marked “Chagos Archipelago (Republic of Mauritius)”. Two further requests were sent by Mauritius criticising the “mislabelling”, but no change has yet been made online. Legal proceedings, Mauritius has warned, could be brought against Google. Jagdish Koonjul, the Mauritian ambassador to the United Nations, said: “We never received a reply. It’s disappointing. One would have assumed that Google would be the ideal place to obtain information and that whatever they are [displaying] would be accurate. What they are showing is incorrect.” The Google Maps search engine, when it locates BIOT, merely explains that it is “a disputed British Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom situated in the Indian Ocean halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia”. After being approached by the Guardian, Google said it was looking into the matter. Apple Maps, by contrast, agreed to change its labelling. Searches for both “BIOT” and “British Indian Ocean Territory” on Apple Maps produce the response “No results found”. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said: “The UK has no doubt as to our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory, which we have held continuously since 1814. Mauritius has never held sovereignty over the territory and the UK does not recognise its claim.” Meanwhile, the former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a longtime supporter of exiled Chagossians, has published a letter of support following Mauritius’s first expedition to the Chagos Islands to assert its sovereignty. He declared: “The British government must now engage with Mauritius and negotiate a settlement of these issues. I call on the government immediately to restore the right of return of the Chagossians to their homeland and work with Mauritius on a trial resettlement programme.” Alyn Smith MP, foreign affairs spokesperson for the SNP in Westminster, said: “The SNP stands four-square behind international law and it is clear that the Chagos Islands are not UK territory. In 2019, the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn the UK’s continuing, systematic occupation of the Chagos Islands. In the same year, the international court of justice also ruled the occupation illegal. Last month, the UN’s international tribunal for the law of the sea upheld this verdict. “It is high time for the UK to end its illegal occupation of the Chagos Islands. The SNP will continue honouring its longstanding manifesto commitment to supporting international efforts for the Chagos Islands to be returned to their rightful owners and raising the issue at home.”",News/World news, Mauritius asks Google to label Chagos Islands as part of its territory ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/mauritius-uk-google-maps-chagos-islands-territory
2/22/2022,"When I was young – this was, of course, many scores of years ago – we spent a lot of time arguing about fur. On one level, it was a pretty crude political awakening (animal cruelty, for or against?); on another, an early introduction to meaningless position-taking, and how enjoyable it can be (if you could never afford a mink coat, does it matter whether or not you agree with buying one? Well, yes, as a matter of fact, it does!). Philosophically, the knottiest bit was whether you were allowed to buy fur secondhand, considering the fox had already died, most likely in the 1940s. Then someone looked up how astrakhan was made and it was so brutally disgusting that it killed all conversation stone dead and we moved on to arguing about vivisection. I hope I speak for my entire generation, then, when I say how delighted I am to find the controversy reawakened by Jacob Rees-Mogg, along with a similarly familiar one about the sale of foie gras. Ah, the smell of ethics-napalm in the morning. It’s like being 14 all over again. This must be how boomers feel when they trawl through Facebook and find posts about the good old days, when men could be men, and women understood that when a stranger squeezed their arse they meant that in a nice way. Thrilling rage and exhilarating disbelief; these, plus maybe snakebite and black, are what lost youth smells like.  It was the British government’s pledge to ban the import of fur and foie gras, part of a drive to make the UK the least cruel nation in the world. This was intended as an element of our sweet sovereignty, the bliss of being emancipated from the EU. Naturally, we had the freedom to outlaw these products at any time, but let’s not get bogged down in things that are real. We wasted the past five years doing that. And now the government is thinking of ditching the pledge after opposition from within the cabinet. The next five years are going to play out roughly like this: every day will throw up a technical hitch or a broken promise. Perhaps the promise was made with no heed to the technicalities behind it, or maybe its fulfilment was never part of the plan in the first place. It might be a huge promise, such as frictionless trade and boosted prosperity, or it might be a vague one, such as “your oranges will stay exactly the same (probably)”, or “genetically engineered food is nothing to worry your pretty head about”. Sooner or later it will be derailed, and then the Rees-Moggs and Trevelyans and Trusses of this world have two options. They can hope that we all get bored of the details and wander off. Deep down, they know that won’t happen. Even if the vast majority of us are already bored, there will always be one disgruntled remainer, looking up the side-effects of imazalil, or doing a deep dive on why the EU bans ractopamine in pigs. Luckily, there’s an alternative: to drag every issue, from the collapsing food and drink export industry to the made-up market demand for mink, into a culture war, pitting the woke army of generation X against the boomers who’ve been radicalised by the Daily Express. All that’s required of ministers thereafter is to sit back and watch the fireworks – the explosions, hopefully, being a lot livelier and more dangerous, now we’re free of the EU and all their boring safety and whatnot. It’s so predictable, and so basic. The problem for all of us in the woke army will be staying awake.

2/22/2022,"Myanmar’s military junta has appeared in place of the detained Aung San Suu Kyi at the UN’s top court, where it sought to throw out a case alleging that it committed genocide against the country’s Rohingya minority. The decision to allow the junta to represent the country in court, after it seized power in a coup last year, was strongly criticised by advocacy groups and a former UN special rapporteur, who warned that it risked delaying justice.  The claim that Myanmar’s military carried out genocide was brought to the international court of justice (ICJ) by the Gambia after a brutal 2017 military crackdown that forced an estimated 700,000 Rohingya to flee over the border to neighbouring Bangladesh. UN investigators have since alleged the military’s operations were carried out with “genocidal intent”. Previously, Aung San Suu Kyi travelled to the court to defend Myanmar against claims the military carried out mass murder, rape and destruction of Rohingya Muslim communities. She is now being held in detention at the behest of the military, which seized power in February 2021 and charged her with a raft of offences. Aung San Suu Kyi was replaced in court by the junta’s minister of international cooperation, Ko Ko Hlaing, and its attorney general, Thida Oo. Both are subject to US sanctions prompted by the military’s use of brutal violence to repress opposition to the coup. The national unity government (NUG), formed by elected lawmakers, ethnic minority representatives and activists, had said it intended to represent Myanmar at the ICJ. It said it had withdrawn preliminary objections – unlike the junta, whose representatives argued on Monday that the Gambia did not have the legal right to file the case. Yanghee Lee, a former UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, called the hearings a disgrace. “The court should instead recognise the NUG’s authority, formally dismiss the objections, and move swiftly to dealing with the actual substance of the case, the atrocities against the Rohingya people.” The junta’s lawyers outlined several objections, including claims that the Gambia was acting as a “proxy” for the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and therefore lacked standing because the ICJ only rules on disputes between states. Ko Ko Hlaing told the court that the junta, which he referred to as the government of Myanmar, was determined to solve the problems in Rakhine state “through peaceful means of negotiation and reconciliation”. Rights groups point out that the military is in the midst of a deadly campaign of violence against the public. Over the past year alone, in the aftermath of the coup, its has torched villages, massacred civilians and carried out airstrikes across the country to silence opposition. Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, said the military had totally failed to comply with a previous order issued by the court, which said Myanmar must prevent genocidal violence against Rohingya and preserve any evidence of past crimes. “The Rohingya in Myanmar today are subjected to daily harassment and intimidation by authorities, while there are also state-enforced restrictions on their movement, as well as their access to healthcare, education and livelihoods,” Tun Khin said. The junta was also blocking humanitarian assistance, leaving many Rohingya on the brink of starvation, he added. A representative of the Rohingya Student Network, who spoke from Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, told the Guardian the ICJ case represented not only the prospect of justice for Rohingya people, but also the “hope to bring a federal democracy in Myanmar for all those who are fighting [for an end to military rule] in Myanmar right now”. The military’s seizure of power has prompted a shift in attitudes towards minorities. Previously there was little solidarity with Rohingya, but since the coup some protesters have apologised for not standing by Rohingya or believing their claims of persecution. “They joined our fight from 1 February,” said the Rohingya activist, who asked not to be named due to security concerns, referring to the date of last year’s coup. “They just joined our fight, that we [have been] fighting for decades.” Akila Radhakrishnan, president of the Global Justice Centre, said she did not believe the junta’s appearance before the court would lend legitimacy to the military. It was likely to simply reflect a continuation of the status quo in court procedures, she said. Radhakrishnan added: “There is such a strong link between impunity and the coup occurring, and the fact that the military has very rarely faced any direct consequences, that I think there is import to the fact that they are learning that they will be hauled into court – and this time around, unlike 2019, they can’t hide behind Aung San Suu Kyi and the civilian government.”",News/World news,Myanmar junta takes place of Aung San Suu Kyi at Rohingya hearing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/myanmar-junta-to-take-place-of-suu-kyi-at-icj-hearings-into-rohingya-genocide-claims
2/22/2022,"As Storm Franklin raged through the night, Mick Malkinson, 72, lay awake with a familiar sense of fear about what the morning would bring. From his riverside home in Tadcaster, a Yorkshire market town, he heard the “thunderous” noise of metal kegs crashing to the floor as the River Wharfe tore through a brewery warehouse nearby. “The noise was horrendous,” he said. “It was like a world war. There was no sleep at all last night.”  By dawn, the house he shares with his wife, Elizabeth, and their one-year-old cocker spaniel Miska, was among three properties completely cut off by several feet of flood water. “All we can see is a vast lake of water. We can’t get out. It will be up to my neck at the end of my drive. We will be stuck here for a couple of days now.” It is the third time in 10 years that Tadcaster has suffered significant flooding. The last time, in 2015, nearly 100 homes and businesses were damaged when Storm Eva roared downstream, partly demolishing the 18th-century bridge that connects the two sides of the town. Many of the families and businesses that suffered seven years ago woke to the same fate on Monday: Storm Franklin had led to the flooding of about 60 properties, including a butchers, an estate agent and a beauty salon on the high street. The river level did not rise as high this time as during Storm Eva – peaking at nearly 4 metres compared with 4.51 metres in 2015 – but that was little consolation to those affected. “We’re devastated. It’s heartbreaking to see it like this. It’s higher than we expected,” said Andy Charlesworth, the chairman of Tadcaster Albion Football Club, whose historic 2,000-capacity stadium was under water for the third time in seven years. The club has played football on the banks of the Wharfe since its foundation in 1892. Like many of its neighbours, however, it has been looking for a new home because of the ruinous cost of flooding. Few if any local businesses are insured in the event of flood damage – a familiar tale in towns prone to such disasters, despite calls for better protection for small firms. Charlesworth said the club was looking at between £50,000 and £80,000 worth of damage: “What we really could do with is a Premier League footballer to give us a week’s wages. That would just sort it. They’re not exactly strapped for cash.” Brian Bartle, 72, leapt out of bed in the early hours to try to salvage what he could from the estate agent founded by his family in 1978. By mid-morning his shop was under water. “It’s pretty grim,” he said, watching helplessly from 300 metres away, at the edge of the water. It took a year to recover from the 2015 storm, he said, and now he was “back to square one”. “Last time it was pure neglect by the Environment Agency because the bridge was blocked with trees,” he said. “This time it’s just vast water flow coming down too fast.” Many local people questioned why it had taken so long to improve the town’s flood defences after the devastation caused by Storm Eva. A report by North Yorkshire county council last June revealed that the works, led by the Environment Agency, had been delayed until 2024 due to “inaccuracies” with the hydrological model behind the plans. Richard Sweeting, a Conservative district councillor for Tadcaster, said he was “devastated and heartbroken” that the town had been hit again. “The government need to look closely at getting some kind of flood prevention in our town,” he said. “They need to get their act together and put Tadcaster as a priority.” Zoe Devine, 48, co-owner of the flooded Devine Meats, said millions of pounds had been allocated to flood defences, but the work appeared to have been delayed by the Covid pandemic. “You know that the people you are going to get angry at are the very people who will be out helping you, so getting angry is no good,” said Devine. “We’ve been here and done this before.” Malkinson, meanwhile, was preparing to spend days trapped in his home. The retired agricultural engineer had tried twice to sell the house after Storm Eva wrecked their ground floor, but it was “basically impossible” owing to the flood risk. When the flood sirens sounded on Sunday, they had nowhere to go so stayed put and prayed for the rain to stop. No one from the authorities had checked up on them by Monday afternoon, he said: “It is disappointing, especially when they know that our houses are at risk. I’m sure they’ve got a lot on their plate, but it irks sometimes.” An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We are aware of a small number of flooded properties in Tadcaster and are working closely with the emergency services and other agencies to keep the community safe. “A review of the planned flood risk management scheme in Tadcaster highlighted inaccuracies in the complex modelling of the design. This has unfortunately delayed the start of construction but we are working to progress the scheme as quickly as possible to better protect the community from flooding and extreme weather.”",News/Environment,‘We’re devastated’: Yorkshire town hit by floods for third time in decade,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/21/were-devastated-yorkshire-town-hit-by-floods-for-third-time-in-decade

The standard version  You are a contestant on a game show with a £1m prize. A second contestant is in another room. The game is cooperative, so either you both win, or you both lose. You have never met the other contestant before, but you can assume they are just as logical as you are. The game begins with round 1, then proceeds with rounds 2, 3, and so on, for as many rounds as need be. On each round, each contestant has two choices: EITHER To tell the host: “I end the game” and announce a colour (any colour, of the contestant’s choice.) OR To send a message (of any length) to the other contestant. If you both choose to send a message, the messages are sent simultaneously, crossing in transit. To win the game you must both end the game on the same round, announcing the same colours. If only one of you ends the game, or you both end it announcing different colours, you lose. Round 1 is about to begin. What do you do? Solution As I mentioned in the earlier post, a bad strategy is to end the game by announcing a colour on round 1, since it is very unlikely the other contestant will do the same with the same colour. Instead, you and the other contestant should message each other to plan when to end the game, and with which colour. Here’s a sensible-sounding candidate for your first message: “let’s declare red in round 3, please confirm in round 2”. The game is cooperative, so the other contestant will follow your lead if they think it is in both of your best interests. Indeed, this strategy would work if only you sent a message in round 1, and only they responded (to confirm the plan) in round 2. You would win in round 3. However, this strategy does not work for this puzzle because your messages are sent simultaneously. Since the other contestant is as logical as you, maybe they are thinking of sending a similar message. In fact, they may send exactly the same message, in which case, you will both announce red on round 3 and win. Hurrah! But then again, they may make the proposal with a different colour. For example, let’s say you send “let’s declare red in round 3, please confirm in round 2”, as suggested above, and you receive the message: “let’s declare blue in round 3, please confirm in round 2”? Where does that leave you both? Do you stick with red or do you defer to the other contestant and announce blue? They will be struggling with the same dilemma. Indeed, you may come to the realisation that whatever message you send the other contestant, they may simultaneously send you exactly the same message but concerning a different colour. To solve the problem you need to find a way to break the symmetry. The quick answer is to flip a coin. A very good idea is to introduce an element of randomisation. For example, let’s say your first message is “I suggest we both announce red next round. I will do so if you also suggest this.” And let’s say that you receive the message “I suggest we both announce blue next round. I will do so if you also suggest this.” A sensible course of action would be to flip a coin each round, and send the “red” message on heads and the “blue” message on tails. If the other contestant does the same, then in a few rounds you will send each other the same message, and win on the following round. There are other ways to introduce randomness depending on what message you send (or receive). For example, you could flip a coin to send a message about who will lead the process. Heads, you send: “let’s say red next round, if your message indicates you will follow my suggestion.” Tails, you send: “I am going to follow your plan of action if you send one this round.” Within a few rounds you will have established a leader. Provided you send (and receive) a workable plan, any deadlock between you can be broken by introducing randomness. Flip a coin to determine whether to be insistent on your plan, or amenable to theirs, and eventually an agreement will be reached. In computer science, a similar problem comes up in an issue called contention resolution. For example, just say you connect identical computers together on a network. If the computers are identical, they will all want to talk to each other at the same time. But if they do talk at the same time they will garble each other. In order to break the symmetry, the computers do the equivalent of flipping an internal coin, so that an order of priority emerges. 2. The collision variation: The contestants have three choices each round. Either they can end the game and announce a colour, or they can send a message, as in the standard version, or they can do nothing. If both players send a message, the messages collide and are not delivered. In this case, an error message is generated. What do you do? Again, randomness comes to the rescue. Flip a coin to decide whether to send a message or stay silent. On heads, send the message “Announce red on next round, if this message gets through.” On tails, do nothing, and plan to follow whatever is suggested on the message that might be received. It is very likely that in a few rounds a message gets through one way or the other, with a quick win straight afterward. 3. The pigeon variation: Only one contestant sends a message per round. You start in round 1, the other contestant sends in round 2, and you continue alternating between you. Although this time, you are a long distance from each other and the messages are sent via carrier pigeon, which means you can never be sure that the messages arrive. What do you do? The pigeon variation is a version of the two-generals problem, a well-known problem in computer science about communication between two parties where a failure in communication is possible. Since no messages you send may reach the other contestant (and vice versa), you cannot guarantee winning the prize. However, you can attain a very high degree of confidence with the following plan. On round 1 you send the message, “We shall say red on round 1000, please confirm.” On each subsequent round, you send this message again, together with a complete record of all prior messages sent/received. The other contestant, if receiving the message on round 1 should simply follow along and send confirmations. If they don’t receive anything, they should reply with “sorry, no message received; please resend.” Most importantly, they should not start a competing plan, which would only reintroduce the priority issue of the main puzzle. Eventually, messages are likely to get through and the two players will be on track to win with high probability. Today’s puzzles were written by Joel David Hamkins, who used them on admissions candidates when he was Professor of Logic and the Sir Peter Strawson Fellow in Philosophy at University College, Oxford. “In the admissions interviews, which were generally less than 25 minutes, we were happy if a candidate got to the realisation of the symmetry issue in the main puzzle, before going on to the alternating version [in which one message is sent per round], which most students got quickly, and then the collision version, where the randomness idea seemed to arise more naturally. The best candidates were then able to realize how to apply the randomness idea to the main version. With the pigeon version of the puzzle, successful candidates realized the need to achieve confirmation and confirmation of confirmation, and a few put this together to mount the impossibility argument for the case of certainty, and most realized how to increase the likelihood of success by picking a distant round and repeating messages.” Hamkins is currently the O’Hara Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame. For further discussion of this puzzle, please see his blog. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. I’m the author of several books of puzzles, most recently the Language Lover’s Puzzle Book. I also give school talks about maths and puzzles (online and in person).

2/22/2022,"The bombshell revelations of the Suisse secrets, reported by the Guardian and a number of international outlets, are a continuation of the path-breaking work of the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers. In one sense, it’s the same old story over and over again. Every time journalists lift the financial sector’s curtain of secrecy, a web of corruption and nefarious activities is revealed, disproportionately from shady customers and families of dictators, with a smattering of seemingly respectable politicians in democracies caught in the net. But this time, there’s something different. This time it’s not a small, obscure offshore island or a struggling developing country trying to figure out an alternative business model to drugs. It’s a major bank in the middle of Europe, in one of the most prosperous countries in the world; a country where the “rule of law” is supposed to reign supreme. Even more disappointing, given that the country and bank involved have made promises of transparency and doing better. And that’s the point: without more transparency, there can’t be accountability.  In fact, Switzerland’s position increasingly appears two-faced, with a legal framework that penalises those who attempt to pierce its secrecy. Countries around the world have passed whistleblower laws, recognising how hard it is to uncover untoward behaviour. Frances Haugen’s exposure of Facebook’s misdeeds probably wouldn’t have been possible without the US’s strong whistleblower laws. But Switzerland, one of the oldest democracies in the world, seems to have doubled down on its commitment to secrecy, regardless of the incentives it provides for bad behaviour, by threatening journalists and others who try to access data showing what is going on in the dark shadows of its financial system. What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". Regrettably, but not surprisingly, no Swiss outlet was able to join the global journalism collaboration due to the danger of severe legal consequences under the country’s banking secrecy laws. But journalists in other countries should be given kudos too, for risking the possibility of Swiss authorities’ prosecution. Surely, Switzerland must know the chilling effect of its legislation: perhaps its very intent was to preserve its business models as long as possible, of taking a little slice of the ill-gotten gains of others, in return for providing a safe and secret place to hoard and store the geld. The Suisse secrets have two particularly alarming aspects. The international journalistic collaboration only saw a small portion of the bank’s client data, but if in this tiny portion are already so many problematic customers, including dictators and their families, suspected war criminals, intelligence officials and chiefs, a human trafficker, sanctioned businessmen and human rights abusers – a true rogues’ gallery – what would we see if the window into the bank were larger? Second, it appears the countries that suffer the most from the bank’s assistance to bad actors are developing countries and emerging markets. The revelation confirms what experts have warned of for a long time: Switzerland agreed to an automatic information exchange mostly with other advanced countries, but not with poor countries, and especially those that might be the home to these illicit activities. As a result, kleptocracy and corruption can still flourish. It’s good to see that journalists believe in their duty to report, and that they fight for “the right to know” of the citizens of countries such as Switzerland, who can’t control what their politicians hide. Politicians in advanced countries are fond of making speeches condemning corruption elsewhere. But it is countries like Switzerland that are the key enablers: that provide the haven, ensuring the long-term returns. We should be clear: Switzerland is not alone. It rightly complains that closing the door there will simply shift the activities to real estate and finance in Miami, London or other money-laundering centres. Still, there is something morally repugnant about those in the US, UK or Switzerland living off spoils stolen from those so much poorer. And those countries like Switzerland that have designed a legal code that makes this system flourish should be especially embarrassed. How many stories, how many revelations, how many exposés, will it take for Switzerland, the US, UK and other countries to change their laws on secrecy in banking and real estate, and all the other activities that facilitate money laundering and promote crime and corruption? While this treasure trove showed Switzerland benefiting from a flow of money from poor countries, the system itself is corrupting: the rot of tainted money spoils all that it comes in touch with. Hopefully, the Suisse secrets, this enormous achievement of honest and honourable journalism, will put to shame those who have resisted creating a more transparent financial and economic system.

2/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has announced the end of all domestic Covid restrictions in England in a process starting later this week. Here is what is happening and when.  Subject to parliamentary approval of Johnson’s plan, the legal requirement to self-isolate will end on Thursday, with people instead advised to stay at home if they have Covid, or believe they do. They will be advised to take a lateral flow test on the fifth and sixth day of the illness, and if both are negative, and if they have no temperature, they can resume normal life. The current need for non-vaccinated adults to self-isolate if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will also finish, as will the requirement for vaccinated adults and children who have been in contact with a Covid case to test themselves for seven days. There will also be an end to contact tracing. These are also reverting to pre-Covid provisions. The £500 payment for some people on lower incomes will end on Thursday. From 24 March, statutory sick pay and employment support allowance will only start being paid after four and seven days of absence, rather than immediately, as has happened during the Covid pandemic. Free testing for the public will end in England from 1 April, with most people having to pay for lateral flow and PCR tests. There will be some exceptions, with free symptomatic tests remaining for NHS patients and in care homes, and some asymptomatic testing for both. Among the public, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) will set out who will still be eligible for free tests, but it is expected to be limited to people aged 80 and above or those with compromised immune systems only. There will also be tests kept for the Panoramic study, which is assessing the efficacy of antiviral drugs, for the Vivaldi scheme, examining Covid in care homes, and Siren, which looks at the NHS. The guidance for staff and students in schools and childcare to have twice-weekly tests is ending immediately. Covid status certificates will no longer be needed, and people will not be expected to show proof of vaccination. Also, the government will revoke the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No 3) Regulations, which allow councils to respond to local Covid outbreaks with their own restrictions. Wider guidance for businesses will change, for example an end to the current need for employers to explicitly consider Covid in their risk assessments. The end of free tests is, essentially, to save money, with Johnson saying free tests cost the government £15.7bn this financial year. The Department of Health and Social Care will now have to meet any costs of testing from its existing budget, after a long and bruising debate with the Treasury. The cost of tests will depend on private suppliers, but officials suggest it will be “in the low single pounds” for each lateral flow. Currently, people can get a box of seven for free each day via the post, or up to two boxes at a pharmacy. Is it possible. Officials have stressed that Covid is not yet endemic, and that it is possible that new variants could emerge that are both more transmissible and severe than Omicron. There are three main areas. The first is the surveillance system, which monitors infection levels and new variants, with the ongoing ONS study, which tests a representative sample of people, being maintained at what is called a “sufficiently granular” level. Secondly, the UKHSA will keep stockpiles of lateral flow tests and maintain capacity to process PCR tests, to increase tests if needed. The third is the focus on the most vulnerable people for tests. No. This plan is for England only. Health is a devolved matter and it is up to the other UK nations to decide on their strategies. The Scottish and Welsh governments have already warned against the end of free testing. For now, just a statutory instrument – a type of legislation that does not need an immediate vote. MPs would have to approve it within 28 days.",News/World news,All you need to know about the end of Covid rules in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-end-of-covid-rules-in-england
2/22/2022,"Jamal Edwards, who has died suddenly aged 31, was a music entrepreneur whose online video platform SBTV has more than 1 million subscribers and collaborates with some of the world’s biggest musical names. From a small acorn, filming his friends at school in west London on a cheap mobile phone, Edwards created a very large tree, helping to launch the careers of British musical figures such as the singer-songwriters Jessie J, Emeli Sandé and Ed Sheeran, and later working with established international names that have included Drake, Nicki Minaj and Wiz Khalifa.  As Edwards’ personal fortune grew, he expanded into other entrepreneurial ventures, often with a focus on improving the lives of disadvantaged young people. Born in Luton, Bedfordshire, he was brought up in Acton, west London, by his mother, Brenda (nee Artman), an accounts manager and part-time singer, and a supportive stepfather, Patrick Edwards, a mortgage broker, who provided him with cameras and equipment in the early days of his experimentation. At Acton high school Edwards was by his own admission “a bit of a class clown”, rebelling against his strict Christian upbringing and subject to a short attention span that needed constant stimulation. The first film he made was of foxes on his local council estate, after which he began to turn his hand to recording classmates rapping, first on his mobile and then on a camera he had been given for Christmas. A fledgling singer himself, he used the initials of his rapping name, SmokeyBarz, for SBTV, the YouTube channel he set up at the age of 16 in 2006 to upload his film clips and bring them to a wider audience. On his parents’ advice, Edwards quickly switched the focus away from rap to the jagged sounds of grime, which had broken out all around him in its London birthplace and which he saw as “like the punk movement, in terms of lyrics and rebellious attitude”. Shortly after its launch, SBTV became the first new media business to be featured on YouTube – then only a year old. As Edwards noted later in his career, “it was a local boy, global voice thing: when you put your stuff on the internet it goes out to a global audience straight away”. Within a short time SBTV was attracting a large number of subscribers and he was able to begin to make money out of his hobby. Having left school with a handful of GCSEs, Edwards spent three years studying for a BTec national diploma in media moving image at West London College, while also experimenting on music studio equipment at local youth centres. He later worked as a retail assistant in a Top Man clothes store to support himself until the cash from SBTV began to roll in. As SBTV gradually moved beyond grime to take in other musical genres, the scope of Edwards’s influence expanded. At the age of 20 he was featured as an example of the power of the internet in a huge advertising campaign to promote the web browser Google Chrome, which became one of the year’s most viewed items on YouTube. From then onwards his star rose rapidly, and by his early 20s, after SBTV had received significant financial backing from a private equity firm, Edwards became one of the youngest successful entrepreneurs in the UK, a sought-after music mogul who was stopped on the streets by admirers. In his teens he had tasted fame vicariously through his mother, who, after appearing on The X Factor, had picked up further television work and singing roles in a number of West End musicals. Now, however, he was in the spotlight. “I was always Brenda from X Factor’s son, and then it switched to her being the mum of Jamal from SBTV.” While he was soon able to come to terms with the initial strains of fame at such a young age, Edwards’s youthfulness also created some difficulties in his business life. “Everyone I employed was older than me, which was very daunting,” he said. “Sometimes I was swayed by their opinions just because I’ve been brought up to respect my elders. I had to overcome that.” Appointed MBE in 2014, the year he became an ambassador for the Prince’s Trust, he branched out from SBTV into other projects. He designed and launched a headwear collection with his previous employer Top Man – informed by his hoard of hundreds of baseball caps – and was involved with a number of other fashion ventures, among them Primark. In 2017 he made a documentary with the Guardian about male suicide, in which he spoke to childhood friends who had suffered with mental health problems. Two years later he helped to refurbish and reopen four youth centres in Acton with money that he had raised from Google and the Wellcome Trust, later expanding the initiative into other parts of the UK. In 2020 there was a partnership with the Department for Education to encourage young creatives to take up an apprenticeship, and in 2021 he launched the 8BARS app, a digital platform intended to discover new musical talent. Latterly he had embarked on a new, part-time existence as a club DJ under the name Jamal Artman. Despite his swift rise to fortune in the rough and tumble of the music world, Edwards remained an unassuming character, describing himself as a “modern caveman” most at home in a quiet environment. “For me, meditation is removing myself from social media, switching off the phone, reading a book, chilling out,” he said. “Too much social media gives you a headache, damages your eyes. It upsets the whole system.” A keen cyclist, he liked to visit the countryside and was an advocate of eating locally grown food, something he promoted through another of his co-ventures, a chain of health food bars called Ugot. He is survived by his mother and his sister, Tanisha.

2/22/2022,"Welcome to a delicious and sustainable way of eating that’s good for you, your gut microbes and the planet. If you’re looking for an easy, science-backed way to increase your energy, boost your mood, regulate your digestion, find your happy weight and slash your risk of chronic disease, you’re in the right place. As a dietitian and research scientist, I’m here to explain why simply shifting your diet to include more plants could be the best thing you ever do for your health and happiness. And it’s an approach based on facts, not fads. My new book ‘Eat More, Live Well’ shows you how versatile plant-based eating actually is. Forget cutting out or cutting down, I’m going to show you how – and why – increasing the number and range of plant foods you eat taps into the very latest scientific discoveries about how your body works best. That’s right, eating more can improve your health, and my recipes and menu plans will show you just how easy and delicious it really is.  Whether it’s something you’ve been thinking about for a while or a concept you’ve only just started hearing about, research suggests that more and more of us are interested in exploring plant-based eating. This might mean simply eating more veg meals each week; cutting down on meat, fish and other animal-derived products with meat-free Mondays; being a ‘flexitarian’; or excluding some or all animal products completely, as in vegetarianism or veganism. But we all know that we need to eat more veg, and there’s lots of information already out here, so what’s different about this book? Well, first of all, the science. I’m not promoting a fully vegan diet, because research doesn’t necessarily support that from a health perspective (more on that in the book). I’m not even suggesting you should go vegetarian, although this book is still for you if you’re vegetarian or vegan. What the evidence suggests is that we could all benefit from eating more plants, but that doesn’t necessarily have to mean only plants. So, rather than being about what not to eat, this book is all about the many varied and astounding benefits, flavour included, of basing your diet around plants. Because once they’re the star attraction, trust me, you’ll experience a health transformation. My first book, Eat Yourself Healthy, was designed to help people identify and tackle their digestive issues and achieve great gut health. Since it was published, I’ve received thousands of messages from people whose health is flourishing after following the programme it sets out. I know there are lots of you out there who are on board with the idea that gut health underpins overall health. Many people also got in touch to ask for a followup that looked more closely at exactly which foods our gut loves and why. So, this book zooms out and speaks to anyone and everyone who simply wants to eat in a way that’s more aligned with what our bodies (and gut microbes) need. And what they definitely need more of is plants. My approach to nutrition is categorically not about dieting. Neither is it a trendy fad that cuts out food groups or nutrients. Instead, it’s your introduction to, and inspiration for, a life-changing way of eating that brings profound, science-backed health benefits in both the short and the long term. Sure, one of those may be to do with weight management, but the benefits linked to nourishing our gut microbes go much further than that – from mood, to skin, to hormones and immunity; they are powerful little things. There is no calorie counting here, no weighing and measuring (of yourself or the foods). In fact, there’s none of the cutting out you may see with other eating plans. I see this approach as enriching, not restricting; inclusive, not exclusive. More plants, more variety, more fibre, more flavour. I call it the Diversity Diet. We know that, generally speaking, the greater the diversity of the trillions of gut bacteria that live in our digestive track (known as our gut microbiome, or GM), the better our overall health and resistance to infection. I always come back to that sports team analogy – you need a breadth of skills to be at the top of your game. And with so many different types of microbe out there (scientists estimate there are tens of thousands of strains of unique bacteria that can dwell in the gut), it’s no surprise that we each have a distinct combination within us. Our GM is unique to us, like our fingerprints. Identical twins may share the same human genes, environment and lifestyle, but their GM will always be different. So long as it’s well supported (that’s where Eat More, Live Well comes in), our inner universe is a hive of activity, working super-hard at tasks like: Munching up fibre and phytochemicals from the plants we eat. Making vitamins (K and the different Bs), amino acids, hormones and chemical messengers. Training our immune system. Activating and deactivating medicines and toxins (this explains why, at least in part, people can respond in different ways to the same medications). Making chemicals that strengthen the gut barrier, helping to balance blood sugars, lower blood fats and regulate appetite. Communicating with our brain, skin, liver, thyroid, heart and just about every organ in the human body. Protecting us against a proliferation of harmful microbes. Assisting gut movement and function. In other words, a thriving GM can optimize digestion, immunity, metabolism, hormones, brain function and gene expression (turning our genes ‘on and off’, affecting what scientists previously thought was our ‘destiny’). I don’t know about you, but with them having this responsibility, I think we owe it to these microbes to give them as much support as we can. Whether you think of your GM as your inner universe, Tamagotchi, pet, friend or simply untapped potential, the next time you sit down to a meal, it’s worth acknowledging you’re never just eating for one. The empowering news is that so much of our GM’s health and happiness is in our control. There are many ways we can look after our GM, in terms of what we eat and how we treat it (with things like sleep, stress and even exercise). In fact, our diet and lifestyle choices actually have a much bigger effect on how healthy our GM is than our genetics do. And so far, research indicates that people who consume high-fibre diets made up of a wide range of whole plant-based foods from the ‘Super Six’ (wholegrain, vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, seeds and herbs and spices) typically have the greatest GM diversity and stability. This was the main driving force behind me writing Eat More, Live Well – to spread this landmark discovery beyond the research bubble and help as many people as possible to embrace the far-reaching benefits of the Diversity Diet.

2/22/2022,"The chair of UK Sport, Katherine Grainger, has said future funding for winter sports will be based on grassroots participation as well as medals, after Great Britain departed the Beijing Winter Olympics with just two medals. Grainger pointed to the need to “make our sports as wide and diverse as possible” and to reach a wider cross-section of the public. “It comes down to the fact that this public money – the public should have a benefit from it,” Grainger said. “A huge amount of that has been in the past two decades built around the focus on success, meaning the medals, and that is what gives us that status globally.”  Both Team GB medals were secured in the final days of the event after gold- and silver-medal performances by the curling teams led by Eve Muirhead and Bruce Mouat. Other winter sports face questions about Team GB’s failure to match its target of three to seven medals. Great Britain won a joint-record five medals in both 2014 and 2018. “Curling lifted the team, no doubt, but a lot of people – athletes first and foremost – would have been disappointed with the performances out there and we need to find out the reasons why that happened,” Grainger said. This will be a moment for reflection as the various sports begin to review recent events and look to find solutions in order to improve in the years leading up to Milan-Cortina in 2026. “We will make our big investment decisions around the summer this year, and the main thing is for all the sports individually to go into a huge review process of not just the Games itself but also the last four years to see what worked, what didn’t work, and what can be improved,” she said. Despite frustration over some results, Grainger argues that the overall impact of the sports should also be considered: “You might be saying, ‘That’s a disappointing Games.’ But actually the influence it can have and the reach it can have really matters. And that is why we will keep funding the winter sports and really backing them.”",Sport/Sport,"Winter Olympics funding will not just be guided by medals, says UK sport chair",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/winter-olympic-funding-will-not-just-be-guided-by-medals-says-uk-sport-chair
2/22/2022,"A majority of voters see China and the bilateral relationship as a complex issue to be managed rather than a threat to be confronted, and more voters trust Labor than the Coalition to manage that complexity, the latest Guardian Essential poll suggests. After a bare-knuckle political week where the prime minister, Scott Morrison, branded Labor’s deputy leader a “Manchurian candidate” and declared the ALP unequal to the task of managing the regional threat environment, the latest poll of 1,089 respondents suggests Australians hold a nuanced view of the Australia-China relationship.  While last week’s partisan confrontation played out in stark binary terms, the new poll shows 61% of respondents characterise the bilateral relationship with Beijing as complex, and only 26% see it as a threat to be confronted. The proportion of respondents seeing the China relationship as a threat is now only two percentage points higher than it was when voters were asked this same question in September 2021. Last year, 66% of respondents characterised the relationship as a complex dynamic to be managed. Morrison last week repeatedly accused Labor of being “weak” on security threats and declared that only the Coalition would not “appease” Beijing. But the data shows the opposition currently maintains a nine-point lead over the Coalition when people are asked which party they trust to manage the Australia-China relationship. Just over a quarter of respondents (28%) say they trust the Coalition to build the relationship in Australia’s best interests, while 37% say they trust Labor to, and 34% of respondents are unsure. Morrison sought the partisan confrontation with Labor on national security and China after suffering a significant parliamentary defeat the week before, when moderate Liberals effectively torpedoed the prime minister’s signature religious discrimination legislation. The politicisation was blatant enough to prompt a rare public rebuke from the head of Asio, Mike Burgess. Burgess warned twice last week the pre-election weaponisation of serious issues made it harder for Asio to do its job. Former Asio chief Dennis Richardson went further. He argued in a series of interviews last week that the Morrison government was serving China’s interests, not Australia’s, by politicising national security ahead of the election, and “seeking to create the perception of a difference [between the major parties] when none in practice exists”. National security is generally considered fertile political territory for the Coalition. But metrics charting primary voting intention and approvals suggest Morrison and the Coalition went backwards during the past parliamentary fortnight – although the movements are within the poll’s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points. Voting intention figures calculated by Guardian Essential now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus” rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. Labor is on 49% (up two points) and the Coalition on 45% (down one point), with 6% of respondents undecided in the latest two-party preferred “plus” measure. Labor’s primary vote is 38%, up from 35% a fortnight ago, and the Coalition is on 35%, down from 37%, with the number of undecided voters going from 8% to 6%. Labor’s primary vote in the current survey is the highest it has been since January 2020, when Morrison’s standing took a hammering during the catastrophic bushfires of that summer. Morrison’s net approval has also moved from zero to negative in the latest data, with 44% (down two points) of respondents saying they approve of the prime minister’s performance and 49% (up three points) saying they disapprove. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Anthony Albanese’s net approval has bumped up from zero to positive, with 42% (up three points) of respondents saying they approve of the Labor leader and 39% (steady) saying they disapprove. Albanese also closed the gap slightly with Morrison on the poll’s “better prime minister measure”. Morrison still leads his Labor counterpart 40% to 35%, with 25% undecided. A fortnight ago Morrison led Albanese 42% to 34% with 25% undecided. A number of questions put to voters about the attributes of the two major party leaders suggest Morrison has lost standing with voters since the middle of last year. But despite his current difficulties, Morrison continues to rate ahead of the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, as the preferred Liberal party leader (30% say Morrison, 13% say Frydenberg and 9% say Dutton, while 16% respond “other” and 32% are unsure).",News/Australia news,"More voters trust Labor than Coalition to manage Australia-China relationship, poll suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/more-voters-trust-labor-than-coalition-to-manage-australia-china-relationship-poll-suggests
2/22/2022,"It is, by any measure, an extraordinary intervention in Australia’s rapidly evolving electricity market. A consortium worth hundreds of billions of dollars on Saturday lodged a formal offer to buy AGL Energy – the country’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter – for just short of 5% above the closing share price on Friday.  The headline name behind the bid is Mike Cannon-Brookes, the 42-year-old co-founder of software company Atlassian, green solutions investor, climate action advocate and one of Australia’s richest people. But in reality, Cannon-Brookes’ company Grok Ventures is the smaller player in the consortium, which is led by Brookfield, a Canadian investment giant with $688bn worth of assets under management last year. Including AGL’s debt, the bid was just short of A$8bn. According to the main players, a significant part of the motivation is to close and replace the company’s coal-fired power plants and prevent a controversial demerger that would hive off those coal plants from AGL into a new entity called Accel Energy. The consortium says it has up to $20bn to spend on building and contracting at least 8 gigawatts of renewable energy and energy storage to replace about 7GW of existing power plants. AGL’s Bayswater and Loy Yang A coal plants, currently scheduled to shut by 2033 and 2045, would be gone by 2030. The company would reach net zero emissions by 2035 and suddenly be playing its part in limiting global heating to 1.5C, in line with scientific advice. The proposal is much bigger than just the coal power plants. It would involve Brookfield and Grok Ventures acquiring all of AGL’s generation assets and its retail business. Cannon-Brookes stresses it isn’t a philanthropic investment. He says he is confident backing renewable energy over ailing old coal power plants can keep electricity prices down, create more than 10,000 jobs and wipe out about 40m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – more than 8% of Australia’s annual emissions footprint – while turning a profit. Analysts and some within AGL see access to the company’s 4.5 million customers across the country as a key motivation for any would-be suitor. For Brookfield’s part, it is a shareholder in fossil fuel assets, but it is noteworthy that the bid includes the name of Mark Carney, the company’s head of transition investing since 2020. He made his name as first the governor of the Bank of Canada, then the Bank of England, and then the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance in the lead-up to last year’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow. A Brookfield renewable energy arm has about US$65bn assets under management. The bid is timed with at least one eye on the upcoming demerger, which AGL declared on Monday was on track to happen by 30 June. The consortium says the split risked leading to the separated entities trading at a lower share price, reducing value for shareholders. There was a swift rejection after the board met on Sunday afternoon. It claimed the offer “materially undervalues the company”, as it offered only a 4.7% premium on Friday’s share price. The consortium rejected this rebuttal just as quickly. It says the offer represented about a 20% premium on the company’s three-month volume-weighted average share price of $6.28 and pointed to its expectation the value would fall after the split. Cannon-Brookes told Guardian Australia on Monday the consortium would continue to engage with AGL and he would focus on “trying to explain to shareholders why we believe this is the best option”. Within AGL, there was some excitement at the prospect that a billionaire entrepreneur with Cannon-Brookes’ success at creating a software firm was making a play for the company. It had lost up to 80% of its share value over the five years prior to the takeover offer although its stock had started to bounce back in the past 12 months. AGL shares gained more than 10% during Monday’s trade. According to the experts, yes, though it would be challenging. Cannon-Brookes was quick to point to a draft blueprint for the future grid published by the Australian Energy Market Operator in December, known as the integrated system plan. That document suggested under a step-change scenario – now considered the most probable path – coal would exit the system at roughly three times the pace then proposed and there could be a nine-fold increase in large-scale renewable energy such as wind and solar farms. It is not a report the Morrison government tends to emphasise. No one disputes that the rise of renewable energy is making coal plants unviable as the around-the-clock generators they were meant to be. They can’t compete with an influx of cheap solar energy in the middle of the day and were mostly not built to ramp down and then back up when needed. Department officials project renewable energy will increase from about 30% now to 69% by 2030. Labor says under its policies it would reach 82%. It is not only AGL that is under pressure. In the most recent announcement, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025 rather than 2032. Plenty, including whether the consortium would be open to paying more and the timing and specifics of the investment plan. The bid would have to be cleared by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Buying AGL would involve taking on 3.2 million gas customers. Cannon-Brookes indicated the consortium would want to move them to renewable electricity, a significant undertaking in its own right. Cannon-Brookes acknowledges it is “on a global scale a massive decarbonisation effort” but says the plan makes sense. The consortium’s offer letter says it conducted detailed market modelling with consultants Marsden Jacob Associates and was confident its plan was achievable. “The economics stacks up, the science stacks up, what we require is just the gumption to go for it and actually make it happen, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Cannon-Brookes says.",News/Business,Why is a tech billionaire trying to buy Australia’s dirtiest energy company AGL?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/why-is-a-tech-billionaire-trying-to-buy-australias-dirtiest-energy-company-agl
2/22/2022,"The New South Wales transport minister, David Elliott, started Monday on a rhetorical cliff and kept walking. On Sydney radio station 2GB, Elliott described industrial action taken by the state’s rail workers as “terrorist-like activity”, then accused the Rail, Tram and Bus Union of acting like “cowards”, spreading “bullshit” and “hijacking the city”.  At a hastily arranged media conference a few hours later, he effectively accused union members of seeking to change the government. The industrial action taken by the rail union was designed to “bully the electorate” into voting for Labor, as well as “disrupt the recovery from Covid”, he said. Elliott was not alone. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, weighed in, also on 2GB, to condemn the “strike”, while the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, described the action as a “coordinated attack by the Labor party and the union movement”. Labor and the union movement, Perrottet said, were “in bed with each other to cause mass destruction in our city and our states”. The union flatly rejected the government’s description of their industrial action as a “strike”, calling it a “low level” measure that wouldn’t have affected services. As the day went on it became clear the government had taken the extraordinary step of closing down the transport network because it had “misinterpreted” an agreement it struck with the union during negotiations over the weekend. Workers had turned up for their shifts on Monday to find they had been locked out by the transport department. “The NSW government is spitting the dummy and trying to make a point,” the RTBU secretary, Alex Claassens, said. While the government accused the union of taking politically motivated industrial action, Elliott’s interventions on Monday were revealing in terms of his own focus. Neither his 2GB interview or the snap press conference – which some media were not alerted to – were held with transport officials who could have explained, for example, what contingency measures had been implemented to assist commuters during the shutdown of the network. Nor was the government able to explain – beyond citing the safety concerns of those same absent transport officials – why the network needed to be abruptly shut down when the union had publicised its intention to take limited industrial action as early as Wednesday last week. Indeed Perrottet was asked on Monday on whether the shutdown was a copy of Qantas’ decision in 2011 to ground its fleet amid an industrial dispute, a step which prompted the Fair Work Commission to terminate the workers’ action because of the risk to the economy. He denied that was the case. By Monday evening, the government had backed away, with limited services to run on Tuesday and the Coalition agreeing to “continue to negotiate with the unions and work through their list of claims”. Elliott’s handling of the matter was being questioned by senior ministers and the union had committed to continue its planned industrial action after crowing the transport minister had “backed down”. “To deliberately shut down the rail network on such a big day for many people, seemingly so they can run a fear campaign about unions, is quite extraordinary,” Claassens said. But despite the messy handling of the dispute, the government’s decision to lash out at the union on Monday is revealing. It is certainly true that with a federal election looming and the next NSW election only 12 months away, the union movement is flexing its muscle. Indeed, Unions NSW boss Mark Morey was on the front page of the Daily Telegraph on Monday declaring 2022 would be the year of the strike if the government refused to scrap its 2.5% wages cap. It was less than a week ago that the state’s nurses were holding their first state-wide strike in almost a decade outside the state’s parliament, and teachers and bus drivers have also flagged their intention to conduct further industrial action. The NSW Public Services Association secretary, Stewart Little, said his union – which represents prison workers, some education staff and a variety of other public sector workers – would also consider taking protected action if the state government moved to repeal Covid-era workers’ compensation laws. Little also said removing the 2.5% wages cap – which has been in place since the NSW Liberal government came into power in 2011 – had taken on a new urgency for unions amid increasing job pressures during the pandemic, as well as inflation and increased cost of living pressures. “I think it’s inevitable that you’ll see more industrial action and strike action,” Little said on Monday. “The pressures on working people are increasing and the unions can’t sit by while our members are seeing their conditions deteriorate.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It’s in that context that Elliott, Perrottet and the prime minister’s comments must be viewed. The NSW government believes that a year out from a state election it is being targeted by a concerted union campaign. But it also sees an opportunity. By painting Monday’s action as an “unAustralian” act of “industrial bastardry”, as Elliott did, the government is seeking to paint the union movement – and with it Labor – as out of touch with the concerns of everyday people. “This is reminding me of the way they behaved in the 1970s, and I don’t think they’ve read the room,” Elliott said on 2GB. It’s a tactic that has worked before. After all, the majority of Australians are no longer members of a trade union, and many see industrial action as a disruptive annoyance, and conservative governments often feel on safe ground fighting a trade union movement they claim is unrepresentative of average people. The question is whether, after two years of a pandemic in which frontline workers such as nurses, teachers and, indeed, transport workers, have kept the country going, it is the government that has “read the room” by picking this fight.",News/Australia news,More strikes ‘inevitable’ in NSW as government ramps up anti-union rhetoric,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/more-strikes-inevitable-in-nsw-as-government-ramps-up-anti-union-rhetoric
2/22/2022,"By far our most memorable and worst gig was the first one, on 23 October 1982. Billy Walsh, who was then in an early version of the Cosmic Psychos called Spring Plains, had run up all these parking fines. So my friend organised a gig to make the money back. Bass player Phil Nelson and I were just learning how to play, but he said “Let’s get a band together, we’ll get more people there.” So that was why the band started – to play Bill Walsh’s parking fines. It was supposed to be a one-off show.  At the time, Hunters & Collectors were the coolest band in town, and I wanted a piss-take of their name – something AND something else – so my friend Tess, now my wife, goes, “How about the Painters and Dockers?” as a joke. And I said, “That’s it!” At the time, there was a royal commission into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, because some members had literally been knocking each other off. Our singer Paulie Stewart ended up in the band at the last minute. He met Phil at the Prahran market and told him he could play trumpet. Basically, anyone we knew who said they could play anything was in. We didn’t have a drummer, so Bill played for Painters and Dockers and Spring Plains that night. He was so fucked that in one of the songs he just stopped playing – his arms were so tired he couldn’t keep up. We played the gig at a pub called the Rising Sun in Port Melbourne. What we didn’t know was that this was where members of the actual Painters and Dockers Union used to drink. I remember my eldest brother saying to me, “You’ve got to change your name. These guys don’t fuck around, they’ll kill you!” But while we were playing, one of them walked in (the crowd parted like the Red Sea) and gave us all a beer, so then I thought, OK, we’re not gonna die. Unfortunately, a man who lived nearby got the shits with the noise so came in with a machete and started chopping up the mixing desk because he wanted us to stop playing. Six divvy vans turned up, cut the whole street off, and the whole pub evacuated in two minutes. We were running down the street with our amplifiers trying to get out of there. It was insane. The next morning my mate went to the pub so we could get paid. It was probably about five or six hundred bucks – enough to pay Billy’s fines – but the owner at the time said, “Oh, there’s been a bit of damage, let’s just call it even.” Check out Painters and Dockers’ Facebook page for upcoming gigs around Australia",Arts/Music,Painters and Dockers on their worst gig: a man stormed in with a machete,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/22/painters-and-dockers-on-their-worst-gig-a-man-stormed-in-with-a-machete
2/22/2022,"Australian basketballer Josh Giddey has won many plaudits of late. During the recent NBA All-Star weekend, LeBron James became the latest to heap praise on the 19-year-old Oklahoma City Thunder rookie. “He has a great pace about the game, great vision,” said the basketball legend. “He’s playing beautiful basketball.” Giddey has won rookie of the month in the Western Conference for three consecutive months, and made history as the youngest-ever NBA player to record a triple-double. Most recently, just last week, the Victorian became the first NBA rookie to register three straight triple-doubles since basketball Hall-of-Famer Oscar Robertson 60 years ago.  But a true measure of Giddey’s character can be found not in this rush of recent success, but from a time of disappointment. Mid-last year, the teenager was part of the training squad for the national team when Giddey was told he would not be part of Australia’s 12-man side at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It would have been a crushing blow, missing out on the opportunity to play in the green and gold on the grandest stage, just edged out by fellow youngster Josh Green. Ultimately, the non-selection cost Giddey a bronze medal – the Boomers’ historic first-ever international triumph. Yet he took it in his stride. “I could have sat around and sooked about it for a while,” Giddey admitted last year. “[But] I used it as motivation. I didn’t hold grudges and say, ‘they should have put me in the team’ or ‘this was wrong’. I just accepted the decision, moved forward.” Despite being cut from the Tokyo team, Giddey remained with the Boomers at a camp in Las Vegas – starring in an exhibition match against Nigeria. Rather than smart from non-selection, he put his head down and got to work. Giddey’s attitude towards disappointment suggests a bright future ahead. Being an elite basketballer comes with more than its fair share of ups and downs; players who can dust themselves off after a fall are the ones who thrive. In basketball, you quite literally miss every shot you don’t take. “Going forward,” he said of the Boomers snub, “it’s probably going to be for the better as it motivates me and makes me hungrier to make the next team.” Born in Melbourne, Giddey has basketball in his blood. His parents, Kim and Warrick Giddey, were both professional basketballers with the Melbourne Tigers. Kim was known for her scoring, Warrick for his tight defence. Giddey junior combines both attributes; he is now a 6ft 9in guard with superb on-court intelligence (even if his father jokes, of the complementary parental traits, that his son “excels in neither of those two areas.”) Midway through high school, Giddey joined the NBA Global Academy – co-located with the Basketball Australia Centre of Excellence, within the Australian Institute of Sport, in Canberra (where, coincidentally, he was coached by Marty Clarke, a former teammate of his father). The AIS basketball program is internationally renowned: almost every male and female Australian basketball star in the past four decades has come through the system. It was at the AIS where Giddey blossomed, adding four inches of height to press his claim for an NBA draft spot. With his wingspan, gangly build and smart passing game, the teenager quickly emerged as a future star. Yet rather than follow the well-trodden path to an American college team, Giddey opted to remain at home for an extra season – joining National Basketball League outfit the Adelaide 36ers, where he won rookie of the year. It was an astute decision, becoming the first home-grown talent to participate in the league’s Next Stars program, which has attracted a number of international prospects to Australia in recent years. Even still, Giddey was tipped to go mid-first round in the NBA draft; most observers predicted the Australian would be picked at 10 or lower. Instead, in a minor-shock, Oklahoma took Giddey with their No 6 pick, putting him in an elite category of Australians to have been drafted in the top 10, alongside former No 1 picks Andrew Bogut and Ben Simmons, and Dante Exum, who went at five. But the selection came as no surprise to Giddey, who had his heart set on the Thunder (he told a team reporter: “Ever since the pre-draft process started, Oklahoma is where I wanted to be. I said to my agent, ‘you’ve got to do everything you can to talk to these guys and get them to draft me’.”) The draft pick proved shrewd business for OKC. While the team languish in 14th in the Western Conference, Giddey has made a strong bid for rookie of the year. He is averaging 12.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 6.4 assists a game. At the All Star weekend, James singled out the Thunder’s general manager for praise. “The MVP over there is Sam Presti,” he said. “I mean, Josh Giddey is great. But Sam Presti, I don’t understand this guy’s eye for talent. He drafted [Kevin Durant], Russ [Westbrook], Jeff Green, Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson, Josh Giddey and the list goes on and on and on.” If Giddey is to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Durant and Westbrook, he has a long road ahead. Many rookies shine bright before fading into obscurity. But the 19-year-old from Melbourne has the physical attributes, basketball intelligence and mental fortitude to star at the highest level. Come the Paris Olympics in two years’ time, there is little chance Giddey will miss out again. Australian basketball has a new star.",Sport/Sport,"Disappointment, not success, the true measure of Josh Giddey’s character | Kieran Pender",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/22/disappointment-not-success-the-true-measure-of-josh-giddeys-character
2/22/2022,"When I told a friend I was writing about the most environmentally friendly way to care for polyester, he joked: “Put it in the bin.” Since polyester is a plastic that won’t biodegrade in landfill, he’s definitely wrong. But his joke reflects a growing concern that polyester clothing is an environmental hazard. To start with, virgin polyester is derived from fossil fuels, and as the technology stands, recycled polyester is more accurately downcycled plastic. The process takes bottles out of a closed loop system and degrades them so they can’t be recycled again.  These environmental challenges are compounded during use. Polyester is a smelly, sweaty, stain-prone material that sheds plastic microfibres when it is washed and worn. But, because it’s cheap, it’s in more than half our clothes. Since it’s very likely we all have something made from polyester in our wardrobes, here is some expert advice on how to minimise its impact. Microfibres are tiny particles that break off our clothes when we wash and wear them. Velina Karadzhova, the head of First Sentier MUFG Sustainable Investment Institute, says they’ve “been found in air, rivers, oceans, soils, tap water and human food such as fish and vegetables”. To make matters worse, since synthetic materials don’t break down in natural environments, microfibre pollution is accumulating. Paul Servin, the applications development director at Xerox Technology Group, says “around one third of all primary microplastic pollution comes from washing our clothes in the washing machine”. Rebecca Van Amber, a textile scientist from RMIT university, says you can significantly reduce microfibre shedding by making simple changes to your laundry. She suggests using a liquid detergent and lower water temperature, switching to a front-loader washing machine and, instead of tumble drying your clothes, hanging them out to dry. According to Servin, washing garments in a full load of laundry can reduce shedding by up to five times. He also recommends washing garments less often and says: “Try and consider if the garments need washing or if they can be cleaned in other ways.” Servin says having your washing machine fitted with a microfibre filter is the most effective way to prevent microfibres from wash cycles entering the environment. The latest filter developed by Xeros, called the XFiltra, can capture more than 90% of microfibre pollution. In recognition of the scope of the problem, governments are moving to make microfibre filters a requirement on washing machines. In Australia, the National Plastics Plan aims for “an industry-led phase-in of microfibre filters on new residential and commercial washing machines by 1 July 2030”. There is similar legislation being drafted in the UK and France. Another way to prevent microfibre pollution is by using a Guppyfriend bag. Place your polyester or synthetic garments inside it during washing. Studies show the bags reduce the amount of shedding and catch microfibres that do break off. But, Servin says, be mindful of how you dispose of microfibres caught inside the bag. “The temptation would be to rinse it out under a tap, which would defeat the object.” Experts say the safest thing is to put them in the bin. Another thing to keep in mind is that different fabrics shed microfibres at different rates. Karadzhova says polyester sheds about three times more than nylon, while fabrics from mixed materials also appear to shed less than fabrics made from 100% polyester. Textile weave should be factored in too, Van Amber says, to avoid “fabrics which are fluffy and pill” because this is visible evidence of microfibre shedding. A good example is fleece fabrics that have a brushed surface and raised fibres. She says these fabrics are “much more likely to shed fibres than yoga pants” because smooth stretchy materials are made of longer fibres that have less threads protruding and so are less susceptible to shedding. Since polyester is plastic, it has a complicated relationship with sweat and oil. Which is to say, it holds on to both and won’t let them go. That’s why polyester starts to smell and why stains on polyester can be impossible to wash out. “Any stain should be treated as quickly as possible” because if it has time to dry and set, it will be much more difficult to remove, Van Amber says. “Gently blot an oil stain with soap or detergent and water immediately.” Sweat stains should also be moved on quickly to prevent odour from setting in. Van Amber says polyester fabrics with a looser weave or knit structure should be more resistant to odours. This is because “the gaps and spaces between the fibres and yarns facilitates air flow through the fabric.” On the other hand, fabrics with a very tight weave should be more resistant to staining because “any liquid spilled on it will land as a drop” and the tightness of the structure should delay the drop being absorbed. Finally, be aware of polyester or synthetics claiming to have antimicrobial and anti-odour capabilities. Studies show that while they can control bacteria, they do not control smell.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Move quickly and make small changes: how to reduce the impact of your polyester clothes,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/22/move-quickly-and-make-small-changes-how-to-reduce-the-impact-of-your-polyester-clothes
