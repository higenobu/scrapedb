12/28/2021,"Until now, there has never been a platinum jubilee in British history for the simple reason that no monarch of England or Scotland has ever reigned long enough. That is about to change. In six weeks’ time, on 6 February 2022, Elizabeth II will have reigned for 70 years. It is a formidable feat of longevity, and of much else besides. And the royal record book is not full yet. If she remains on the throne until the summer of 2024, the Queen will become the longest-reigning European monarch of all time, eclipsing even the 72 years of the Sun King himself, Louis XIV of France. The Queen’s anniversary will be marked by events throughout 2022, in much the same way as the silver, golden, diamond and sapphire jubilees were marked before it. The climax, during a four-day bank holiday weekend at the start of June, will be comfortably familiar and a great public attraction: street parties, a televised concert, a thanksgiving service, a pageant, a flypast and a royal visit to the Epsom Derby. It promises to be an outpouring of national affection for the Queen and a feelgood event for a country that has been noticeably deprived of fun recently.  And yet, although the jubilee formula is well established and well liked, there should be no mistaking that this one will be different. The central difference concerns the part that the Queen herself will be able to play. By the time of the bank holiday weekend, she will be 96. Though she has been, until recently, one of the most active nonagenarians imaginable, she is now clearly slowing down. The House of Windsor’s private motto is said to be that the monarchy must be seen to be believed; the platinum jubilee may be a celebration of a monarch who may be scarcely seen at all. There is no reason why any of this will or should detract either from the 2022 jubilee itself or from the public’s enthusiastic celebration of the Queen over the coming months. But the difference from earlier jubilees underlines that the old order is passing. The overwhelming majority of us have no memory of anyone other than Elizabeth II on the throne or of anyone other than a matriarch embodying the monarchy to Britain and the world. Yet it will not be long before there will be a new monarch, a king, who will face the task of remaking the compact between the crown and the public in his own way. The British monarchy is therefore on the threshold of a new phase after this long, stable – and feminised – period in its history. This is something that those who are directly involved have been quietly discussing and planning for years. The expectation is that this jubilee is likely to be the last major royal occasion before the death of the Queen and the succession of King Charles III. The detailed manuals for these events exist and have been regularly revised. Yet this official preparedness for change in the monarchy does not extend, and is generally discouraged from extending, to the British public. This newspaper believes that Britain needs to talk more – and talk more publicly and seriously – about what should come next. As a nation, we are not good at doing this, partly out of deference to the Queen. The family dimension of the Windsors’ lives is endlessly reported and discussed in the media, while television dramas like The Crown generate vast audiences. But the practical constitutional questions about how this monarchy should work in a modern democracy are still treated as almost completely taboo. This is a humiliating situation. The role of the monarchy and its place within democracy, the state and the rule of law are serious questions. They are, in their way, as important as questions about the electoral and parliamentary systems, the powers of government and how laws are made and changed, all of which intersect in various ways with the monarchy. The monarchy enjoys enviable public support, in part as the embodiment of national stability, but the public also wants it to be a modern monarchy, embodying today’s values. There is a need to talk about all this, and to talk about it before the change happens, not after it has already happened. The best way for this to start is in Britain’s parliament, through a select committee – possibly specially convened for the purpose – that can take and collect evidence in public, including from members of the royal family and household if necessary, about a large range of issues. These could include the appropriate constitutional, political and military roles of the monarch, including with other nations; the regulation, financing and accountability of the monarchy; the size of the royal household maintained by the state; the laws of succession and the appropriate ceremonies for the inauguration of the new monarch, including their religious dimension, the coronation and the coronation oath. These issues are an important case in point. The next coronation will be a tourist money-spinner for Britain. But it will also have immense constitutional meaning. The oath that the new monarch swears embodies issues of church and state that are especially problematic in a nation with an established church, and in which less than half of the public describes themselves as religious believers of any kind. The sacral anointment behind a screen of the monarch as a person set apart from the nation and its laws is an especially remarkable challenge for a multi-faith and often largely secular nation. No other constitutional monarchy in Europe attempts all this any longer. Most have decided that the succession is for parliament to decide and administer. Why not Britain too? Let’s at least talk about it. If there is not a serious effort in the very near future to formulate and discuss these questions about the new reign in public, we will one day find that they have already been answered pre-emptively by the monarch-to-be and senior civil servants, but without any public involvement. That contains risks, including for the monarchy, which Britain is unused to confronting during the Queen’s long reign. What should happen in future to our constitutional monarchy is an entirely proper question for modern Britain to consider, especially now and during the celebrations of 2022. The questions are parliament’s business and they are the public’s business too. They should not be concealed or brushed aside as something that is nothing to do with the rest of us.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Queen’s Jubilee: time to face change | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-queens-jubilee-time-to-face-change
12/28/2021,"Hospitality bosses have welcomed news that the government has ruled out additional Covid restrictions in England before the busy New Year’s Eve trading period. Businesses had been calling for certainty, with bars and restaurants saying they had been left in limbo at a time of potentially lucrative bookings – or costly cancellations.  The industry had feared that Boris Johnson and ministers would toughen up Covid-19 measures in England, after the Omicron variant has led to a surge in Covid infections Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already imposed tougher Covid rules on physical distancing and the number of people who can meet, including the closure of nightclubs. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, the industry body, said the confirmation by Sajid Javid, the health secretary, that no further clampdown would come in England until early 2022 was welcome news for businesses. She said that the government had taken a “pragmatic and proportionate approach” which would “give a real lifeline for many who have struggled with the loss of trade in the run up to Christmas. “Losing New Year on top of December would have been devastating, and keeping restrictions to a minimum helps protects businesses and jobs,” she said. The possible restrictions that ministers were reportedly considering, including advice to households not to mix indoors, would have been a lockdown in all but name, she said “with trade pushed to unsustainable levels”. Martin Wolstencroft, the CEO of ARC Inspirations, which runs 18 bars in the north of England, said that having no further restrictions would be “fantastic for the industry”. Speaking before the prime minister confirmed that there would be no changes, he said certainty was needed for “our managers and staff, our customers – who want to know if they can meet up with loved ones – and the full supply chain”. He had planned on the basis that his bars would be open, and had already placed orders, as he said it was not possible to leave everything to the last minute. “This is a very, very profitable time for everyone – it’s when we make the money that gets us through January,” he said. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, which represents bars, pubs, nightclubs, restaurants and entertainment venues, said that the decision had come after “an extremely anxious few weeks for our sector”, but he was pleased that the prime minister had listened. He said: “Our industry can now start to plan with some certainty over the next week, and make up for lost time promoting one of the key nights of the year in the coming days. “It is important that given this opportunity that we continue to recognise our responsibility to the public health strategy, and urge our customers to not only support us during this period but play there part in ensuring that this is the start of our recovery.” Kill said a longer-term strategy was needed, adding: “It is clear that the open, close strategy, which has had a huge impact on our industry, is not sustainable.” Others echoed the call for more clarity. Speaking ahead of Javid’s comments, Paul Askew, the chef patron of the Art School restaurant in Liverpool, said his business was being “eroded” by announcements that had caused anxiety and the cancellation of big group bookings. “This dithering in the middle ground may serve political convenience but not business recovery and confidence,” he said. “The government has to give a clear statement to consumers that it’s safe to go out, or if it isn’t then enact a circuit breaker and compensate all of the businesses affected.” A £1bn emergency package, consisting of business grants and help with sick pay, which was announced last week by Rishi Sunak drew an angry response from hospitality bosses, who said it was not nearly enough after a collapse in pre-Christmas trade for pubs, restaurants and hotels. Nicholls reaffirmed the warning on Monday, adding: “Without further rate relief and a lower rate of VAT to sustain employment, businesses will fail and jobs will be lost.”",News/Business,England’s bars and restaurants cheer absence of new Covid measures,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/27/covid-no-new-restrictions-england-bars-hospitality-businesses
12/28/2021,"My brother, Phil Kitchen, who has died aged 74 after a stroke, was a community support worker and a singer-songwriter. Although born in Yorkshire, he spent most of his life in Newcastle and considered himself a naturalised Geordie. Phil was born in Barnsley, the son of Kathleen (nee Wilkinson), a social worker, and Leslie Kitchen, a priest. He trained as a boy chorister at Wakefield Cathedral and attended Queen Elizabeth’s grammar school in Wakefield. Then he gained a sociology degree (1968) at the University of Kent, and a postgraduate diploma in town planning from the University of Glasgow.  In 1972 Phil moved to Newcastle, initially as a community worker with the Young Volunteer Force, supporting the communities of Stanhope Street and Elswick as they were being relocated from poor housing that was going to be demolished. He also set up a centre where residents could voice their concerns and receive support, and helped to organise community festivals to bring people together. Later he was employed by Newcastle city council in Byker and Walker as the shipyards closed. With council cuts, he became an adult basic skills tutor with marginalised groups, encouraging people to write poetry and prose. As a teenager, Phil had been greatly inspired by Bob Dylan. He started writing his own songs in the 1980s after taking part in a creative writing workshop. In the 90s he joined up with John Dowsett, his lodger, to form the band Doctor Socrates and together they made three albums, released in 1996, 1998 and 2009. Retirement in 2007 gave Phil the time to develop his music, and he started working with Arthur Thompson (often called the “Flat Cap Cellist”). His first album under the name Citizen Marra, A Life, was released in 2020. During lockdown, he released a second album, News from the Northern Lands, in September 2021, which he called a “manifesto for a northern utopia”. It documents the impact of the decline in major industries and of austerity on communities, where he believed that poor people had been left behind. Phil loved Newcastle, its people, countryside and coast – and the River Tyne. At the time of his sudden death he was collating songs relating to the Old Northumbria. Phil married and divorced twice. He is survived by Simon and Robert, sons from his marriage to Heather Holmes; by Bethan, his daughter with Jayne Mills; by seven grandchildren; and by his sisters, Mary, Liz and me.",News/Society,Phil Kitchen obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/27/phil-kitchen-obituary
12/28/2021,"My former tutor Kevin Gornall, who has died aged 47 from a brain tumour, was a design and technology teacher at the all-girls Sandbach high school and sixth form college in Cheshire, where he specialised in engineering. The hours “Mr G” dedicated to his job went far beyond the school day, and he often supported his students in entering science and technology-related national and international competitions, including those run by the Greenpower Education Trust, F1 in Schools and TeenTech.  Many of his students used the extracurricular work he organised to support their applications to Arkwright scholarships, industry placements and degree courses in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Although Kevin and his pupils enjoyed considerable success in many of the competitions they went in for, what truly mattered to him was that his students had fun doing them, and that they gained something from the experience. The medals and podium places were merely a bonus. His commitment was recognised when he was named as outstanding design and technology teacher in 2017 at the Design and Technology Association’s Excellence Awards. His enthusiasm and dedication was supported by his infectious mantra that “nothing is a problem, only an opportunity to find a solution”. More than just a teacher, he truly inspired the next generation of engineers and will be greatly missed by all who were lucky enough to have been taught by him. Born in Rainford, Merseyside, to Margaret (nee Byron), a retail merchandiser, and Gil Gornall, a housing officer, Kevin attended Rainford high school before doing one year of an automotive engineering degree at Coventry University and then returning home to complete an HND in engineering in 1997. Working for a spell in computer-aided design with Martin Roberts, a manufacturing company in Skelmersdale, in 2000 he upped sticks to travel around France as a campsite courier in Normandy, Paris, the Alps and Corsica. It was on a campsite in Paris that he met Sara Lennon, and they became partners, marrying in 2020. On returning to the UK towards the end of 2001, Kevin completed a teaching qualification at Edge Hill University and found his true vocation as a technology teacher, first at Westhoughton high school in Greater Manchester and then, in 2012, at Sandbach high, where he remained until his death. He worked tirelessly for his pupils, inside and outside the classroom, always searching for exciting new projects and experiences that would give them a greater breadth of knowledge beyond the national curriculum. Outside work, Kevin enjoyed working on cars and was a big Formula One fan. He was also a keen traveller and snowboarder, and enjoyed walking his two dogs.

12/28/2021,"An eighth round of talks on reviving the Iran nuclear deal has begun in Vienna, with Iran saying participants have been largely working from an acceptable common draft text and that its team was willing to stay as long as it takes to reach an agreement. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said he wanted the focus of the coming round of talks to be on how Tehran could verify US sanctions had genuinely been lifted. The landmark 2015 deal, from which Donald Trump withdrew the US, had lifted sanctions on Iran in return for controls on its civilian nuclear programme.  “We must reach a point where Iranian oil can be sold easily and without any restrictions so money for that oil can be transferred in foreign currency to Iran’s bank accounts,” Amir-Abdollahian said. He said the negotiators were working from two joint draft texts. The first broadly covers the nature of all the sanctions related to the nuclear deal that the US must lift and the second is on the staging and details of the steps Iran must reverse to come back into compliance with the deal, such as reducing its nuclear stockpile and ending the use of advanced centrifuges. In terms of the third paper on the verification of the lifting of sanctions, Iran has spoken in terms of a fixed volume of oil and industrial exports that must be completed before it need take reciprocal action by returning fully to its compliance with its side of the deal. Iran is concerned western companies will be reluctant to invest in Iran because of fears that a future Republican US president could reimpose sanctions in 2025, putting their investments in jeopardy, as happened in 2018 when Trump pulled out of the deal. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech in February that sanctions had to be lifted in practice, not just on paper. Research from the Iranian parliament set out the number of barrels of oil to be exported a day and the required value of transactions taking place in Iranian controlled banks in Europe. Although the talks will be difficult, Iran seemed intent on injecting some optimism into a process that began in April. In an important announcement the day before the eighth round, Iran’s atomic energy authority gave a public pledge that it would not seek to enrich uranium above 60%, a promise that came as a relief to Russian negotiators concerned that if Tehran pushed ahead to nuclear weapons-grade 90% enrichment, the European and US delegations would abandon the talks. Western diplomats have said they will not allow the talks to drag on much longer, possibly with early February as the final deadline. They point out the talks first started and were then paused for three months while a new Iranian government reviewed its negotiating position. Israel meanwhile claims Iran is procrastinating while its scientists take Iran secretly closer to a nuclear bomb. Western diplomats accept Iran is closer to breakout time than ever before, but this is not the same as being close to possessing a nuclear weapon. Iran, China, Russia, France, Germany, the UK and the EU attended the talks, with a US delegation indirectly involved – a cumbersome procedure upon which Tehran has insisted even though it has delayed progress. Iran has complained in recent weeks that the European countries, especially France, have taken a position that is indistinguishable from the US. The degree to which Iran needs western sanctions to be lifted to be able to produce a viable budget is contested within the country. The leadership team around the new president, Ebrahim Raisi, claims it can avoid lifting costly subsidies on petrol and still produce a viable budget, a claim rejected by many Iranian economists.",News/World news,Iran nuclear deal: eighth round of talks begins in Vienna,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/iran-nuclear-deal-eighth-round-of-talks-begins-in-vienna
12/28/2021,"Judges have been told that it is a matter of “common courtesy” in cases involving transgender people to use the personal pronoun and name that a person prefers, and that reporting restrictions could be used to prevent a previous name being disclosed. In updated guidance, they were also reminded that there is a high level of transphobic hate crime, which is believed to be greatly underreported, and that trans people may be apprehensive about coming to court, particularly when there was a risk of possible disclosure of their medical history.  The new advice is contained in the “equal treatment benchbook”, a 540-page guide from the Judicial College, which is responsible for training judges in county, crown and higher courts in England and Wales. The guidance, however, is also used by sitting judges. In one of 12 chapters, entitled Trans People, the document states: “It should be possible to respect a person’s gender identity and their present name for nearly all court and tribunal purposes, regardless of whether they have obtained legal recognition of their gender by way of a Gender Recognition Certificate.” A person’s gender at birth or their transgender history should not be disclosed unless it is necessary and relevant to the particular legal proceedings, it adds, before warning that there may be situations where the rights of a witness to refer to a trans person by pronouns matching their gender assigned at birth clash with the trans person’s right to privacy. The guide states that issues around gender identity could and should be addressed at an early, case-management stage, for example instances when a witness might be unwilling or unable to give evidence in a way that maintains the trans person’s privacy. “For example, a victim of domestic abuse or sexual violence at the hands of a trans person may understandably describe the alleged perpetrator and use pronouns consistent with their gender assigned at birth because that is in accordance with the victim’s experience and perception of the events.” In the “rare circumstances” where it is necessary in the proceedings to disclose a person’s previous name and transgender history, the guidance says that the court may consider imposing reporting restrictions to prevent the disclosure of this information. It goes on to observe that the Equality Act 2010 appears to be limited in its explicit protection for trans people, in that the protected characteristic is defined as gender reassignment, adding: “However, its full interpretation and scope has not yet been tested in the appellate courts.” In a foreword, Lady Justice King, the appeal court judge and the chair of the college, described the book as a “living document, constantly updated and amended to reflect changing circumstances and to incorporate the most up-to-date knowledge”. In other sections, the document says the need for swift adoption of remote hearings during the Covid-19 pandemic “has magnified difficulties faced by children and vulnerable adults in hearings”. In relation to sentencing at the time of a pandemic, it advises: “It is permissible to take into account the current conditions in prison arising from Covid-19 protection measures, when deciding whether to suspend a sentence. “For example, the likely impact of a custodial sentence could be heavier if the offender is likely to be confined to a cell for much longer periods than usual. This may be even more so for offenders with mental ill health or impairment.” The most recent edition of the document represents the first major revision in three years.",News/Law,Transgender people: judges advised to use preferred personal pronouns,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/27/transgender-people-judges-advised-to-use-preferred-personal-pronouns
12/28/2021,"Staff absences from the Omicron Covid variant are leaving public services in a “perilous state”,a union leader has said, amid new grim warnings about the variant’s impact on the NHS workforce. As much as 40% of NHS staff in London alone could be absent because of rising Covid-19 infections under the “worst-case scenario” envisaged by experts, it emerged on Monday.  “We’d hope that’s a worst-case scenario, but because we are already seeing an increase, I think it wouldn’t be unrealistic to expect that to go up significantly,” said Prof Alison Leary, chair of healthcare and workforce modelling at London South Bank University. London’s absence rate was up by about 30%, depending on the organisation, which included people who were isolating because of positive tests, she told BBC Radio 4’s World at One. Dr Ian Higginson, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the programme that the number of staff absences in NHS emergency departments could “push us over the edge”. Severe staff shortages could also undermine efforts to keep pupils in schools, with headteachers in England saying that they may be forced to send children home if they do no have enough staff. Despite a pledge by Boris Johnson to avoid a repeat of January 2021, when the government insisted that schools would remain open, only for them to be closed after a U-turn, school leaders are warning that the rapid spread of Omicron could lead to mass absences for members of staff when schools reopen. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC that staff absences had been at “unsustainable” levels at some schools, with up to 25% of staff off in the week leading up to the Christmas break. Staff shortages are also being felt across the board in other sectors such as transport, where rail operators have been running reduced services and implementing measures such as running longer trains. The Rail Delivery Group, the British rail industry membership body, said that in the seven days to Friday 24 December, on average 5.4% of trains were cancelled, compared with an annual average of 2.9%. More recent data has yet to be made available. Local authorities are also concerned about staff absences, which are particularly acute in adult social care, children’s services and waste collection services. Its membership body, the Local Government Association, said that councils were concerned that existing staff shortages “could get worse”. Covid-related staff shortages were already biting when it came to basic day-to-day services. Lewisham council in London tweeted on Monday that its reuse and recycling centre was closed until Wednesday, and that black bin collections would be prioritised in the event of delays to rubbish and recycling services.. Jon Richard, the assistant general secretary of Unison, whose 1.3 million members are work predominantly in public services, told the Guardian: “Key health, council, care and police services have so many staff off that lots are worried they will not be able to keep going. “That’s why extra measures to curb virus spread are of the utmost importance in the coming weeks. Years of cuts have left services with just enough staff to get by in normal times. Now Omicron has put paid to that, leaving services in a perilous state.” The National Police Chiefs’ Council said that it had continued to closely monitor absence rates within policing, which was not currently having an effect on forces’ ability to provide their normal service to the public. Lucy Moreton, a professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, said Covid-related absences in frontline services were rising, but she added that this was also being accompanied by non-Covid-related absence, in particular workplace-related stress.",News/World news,Omicron absences leave public services in ‘perilous state’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/omicron-absences-leave-public-services-in-a-perilous-state
12/28/2021,"It was 2003 and the Waifs were booked to open for Bob Dylan for 30 of his tour dates across the United States. After settling into the initial shows, my sister (and fellow Waifs singer) Donna Simpson and I were summoned to soundcheck by Larry Campbell, Dylan’s guitarist, to rehearse some backing vocals on Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door. Sometimes Dylan invites guests onstage to join him in singing it, Larry said.  Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door was the first song Donna and I ever learned and we were over the moon at the prospect of joining Dylan onstage to sing it. “Don’t hold your breath,” Larry told us, “It may not happen.” Mid-tour, Dylan generously gifted our whole band beautiful tailored western shirts – the subtle suggestion being that we could sharpen up our act. Each night we waited, shirts pressed, for the call to join Dylan and his band onstage. The call never came. Twenty-nine gigs in, we’d seen all the shows and had our minds blown by music and the fact we were touring the US with one of the world’s most influential songwriters. We were at the top, riding the easy train with backstage catering and a tour bus, friendly with all the cast and crew. The dream of singing in Dylan’s set had long faded into the humdrum routine of after-gig stories and shenanigans. We would come offstage, drink beers, bust out the Scrabble, get loose and decompress before the overnight long haul to the next gig. The last night of the tour rolled around in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was a big outdoor show, hot and sweaty, and the Waifs were well-received by the 6,000-strong crowd. We came offstage pumped. We had done it! Thirty dates through North America opening for Bob Dylan. The green room was below the stage, down a set of wooden stairs. Donna and I stripped off to our undies, cracked open a bottle of vodka and started up with the guys in the band to celebrate the tour’s wrap. We were a few shots in and feeling a little inebriated when Dylan’s stage manager burst through the door, announcing: “Stage lights down – Bob’s waiting for you two.” WHAT?? “Dylan has just invited you both onstage to sing.” In a frenzy we tore through suitcases looking for our new shirts, hopping around, pulling on pants and shoes. Everyone was screaming: “Hurry up! Hurry up!” Donna was ahead of me on the stairs. At the top I rushed towards the darkened stage and ran smack into a concrete pole. As I reeled backwards, someone caught me and pushed me forward. Lights up. Dylan was to my right. He nodded and mumbled: “Nice shirts.” He started strumming those three chords – the first chord progression Donna and I had ever learned. I was delirious – was this actually happening or did I just knock myself out on a pole? Can heaven wait or am I standing at its door right next to the guy who wrote its theme song? The harmonies kicked in. “Ooooooh, ooooh, ooooooh.” I took the fifth. Dylan took the lead. “Mama take this badge off me … ” We smiled. We were in the song – the first song I painstakingly plucked out on Dad’s guitar in an old trailer on the fishing camp. Donna had stolen the Dylan songbook from the school library so we could ease the boredom between hauling fish. She used to dream of meeting him. This was the song we’d heard our parents sing at parties while we were meant to be sleeping; that we’d harmonised on together at every formative gig we’d ever played since we were teenagers. Every one of those 6,000 people in the audience had a similar story with that song, and in that moment, we were in it, helping to bring the sound and melody to life, sending it out to ignite their own memories and connections. Standing beside the greatest, heads pounding, hearts on fire, singing out, looking sharp. Knocking on heaven’s door.
