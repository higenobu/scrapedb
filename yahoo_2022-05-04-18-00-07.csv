5/4/2022,"On Don Lemon Tonight Tuesday, CNN contributor Ana Navarro spoke about the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion signaling the repeal of Roe v. Wade, and the problem that could emerge for some in the GOP. Navarro referenced the multiple congressional Republicans who have appeared to be pro-life, family-values legislators in public, but were in favor of abortion when it came to their mistresses. “Republicans have daughters, young daughters, and mistresses that get pregnant too. And how many Republican legislators have we heard about in Congress, some of them, who had to leave their jobs because we learned they wanted their mistresses to get abortions,” Navarro said. “So this is one of these causes, one of these issues, where now that they got what they wanted, they may regret it. They may be saying to themselves, ‘Oh, holy lord. We got what we wanted, now what?’” Navarro also called out Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Collins and Murkowski believed the Trump-nominated justices who reportedly voted to repeal Roe, when they intimated during their confirmation hearings that they wouldn’t do so. Both Collins and Murkowski released statements on Tuesday expressing shock at the turn of events. “I got only one thing to say to Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins: Girls, you got played. They absolutely did get played,” Navarro said. “They might have been told one thing in their office. Certainly some of these justices testified to something completely different during their confirmation hearings, and then now we see they intend to vote a very different way.” ANA NAVARRO: This is one of these courses, one of these issues, where now that they've got what they wanted, they may regret it. They may be saying and saying to themselves, oh holy Lord.

Navarro referenced the multiple congressional Republicans who have appeared to be staunchly anti-abortion in public, but were privately all for it when they got their mistresses pregnant. ANA NAVARRO: Republicans have young daughters and mistresses that get pregnant, too. And how many Republican legislators have we heard about in Congress, some of them, who had to leave their jobs because we've learned that they wanted their mistresses to get abortions. KYLIE MAR: Navarro also called out Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, both of whom released statements in response to the leaked opinion expressing shock that Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are now doing what they said they wouldn't do during their confirmation hearing. ANA NAVARRO: Girls, you got played. They absolutely did get played. They might have been told one thing in their office. Certainly, some of these justices testified to something completely different during the confirmation hearings. And then now we see that they intend to vote a very different way. KYLIE MAR: And Navarro levied some serious charges against the justices. ANA NAVARRO: Either they perjured themselves when they were under oath in those confirmation hearings. They lied to those senators in their offices. And Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who should know better, got played.

5/4/2022,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A federal appeals court on Tuesday questioned whether a lower court got it right when it blocked a challenge of North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn’s candidacy by voters who cited a section of the Constitution addressing insurrection as disqualifying him. Three judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, heard arguments in a lawsuit that the first-term Republican congressman filed to derail the formal challenge sent to the State Board of Elections from going forward. U.S. District Judge Richard Myers ruled for Cawthorn in March and prevented the board from formally examining whether he should remain on ballots, and the voters appealed. Cawthorn is one of eight candidates on the May 17 primary ballot for the 11th Congressional District. There's no timetable on when the judicial panel will rule, but the court did accelerate the appeal process. The challenge focused on Cawthorn’s involvement in the rally that preceded the U.S. Capitol riot in January 2021 at which the presidential election outcome was questioned. The voters cite Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ratified in 1868 that is designed to prevent congressmen who had fought on the Confederate side during the Civil War from returning to Congress. North Carolina Congressman Madison Cawthorn is facing a slew of controversies and questions about misconduct. His recent troubles include allegations of an improper relationship with a staffer. Nikole Killion has the details. Similar challenges have been filed against members of Congress in other states who have been strong supporters of former President Donald Trump, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. A Georgia state judge recently heard testimony from Greene but has yet to issue a finding. They will be passed on to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who will ultimately determine whether Greene is qualified. Some circuit judges Tuesday raised doubts about Myers' logic and those of Cawthorn's attorney, who said an 1872 law that removed office-holding disqualifications from most ex-Confederates also exempt current members of Congress like Cawthorn today. “Why would Congress do this anyway?” asked U.S. Circuit Judge Jim Wynn, a nominee of then-President Barack Obama, during oral arguments. “Why would you rather take away a disability of an individual who’s going against the United States?” The amendment says no one can serve in Congress “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.” The amendment does allow Congress to pass laws that can remove such restrictions. But any such law can't for all time prevent prohibitions against future insurrectionists, said Press Millen, a Raleigh attorney representing voters who filed formal challenges of Cawthorn. “You cannot simply amend the Constitution through a vote in Congress,” Millen said. A federal judge in Georgia last month said she disagreed with Myers and ruled the 1872 Amnesty Act didn’t apply to Greene. James Bopp, Cawthorn's lawyer, said his client “vigorous denies that he ever engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, the country he loves. But this is not about the facts. This is about the law. This is about whether there are valid claims that are being made under Section 3 against him.” Bopp, who also represents Greene in her case, told the judges that the Constitution leaves the decision on whether someone is disqualified to serve in the U.S. House with the elected body itself, not the states. That means a candidate's ultimate seating doesn't get settled until when each two-year session begins in January, he said. In the meantime, Bopp suggested, elections will work out potential conflict. “In a democracy ... where we have the right to vote and we have the First Amendment, we leave a lot of things to the voters,” Bopp said. But Millen countered by saying the Constitution makes clear that insurrectionists can't be members of Congress, just like teenagers or citizens of other countries. The tangled case began in January, when candidate challenges were initially brought against Cawthorn by voters in a district that he initially decided to run in this fall. But North Carolina’s congressional map for the 2022 elections was altered twice since then because of redistricting litigation that changed the district that Cawthorn decided to run in this fall. That led to a second challenge by voters in the 11th Congressional District. Myers refused to let voters from the new 11th District and the other district that Cawthorn had officially filed to run in earlier formally enter the lawsuit. Those denials also form part of the appeal argued Tuesday and also were heard by Circuit Judges Julius Richardson and Toby Heytens. Richardson was a Trump nominee, while Heytens was picked by President Joe Biden.",Politics/Associated Press,Court mulls ruling that blocked NC Rep.
