4/5/2022,"As horrifying evidence of the execution of civilians emerged from the Ukrainian town of Bucha and elsewhere at the weekend, the Russian government took a familiar tack: deny, deny, deny. No matter that some of the explanations were contradictory, with state television amplifying claims that the images of dead civilians in Bucha were both staged and that the civilians had been killed by Ukrainians themselves. In recent years, the Russian government has developed a familiar playbook in response to allegations of bombing runs in Syria, the downing of the MH17 airliner in east Ukraine, the Salisbury poisonings or acts of violence targeting Chechen civilians during the conflicts there in the 1990s and 2000s. “I think it’s similar to what it was in connection to shocking reports from Aleppo or Idlib – meaning that state-sponsored media is always ready to deny war crimes allegations as ‘fakes’,” said Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch. “But until recently, the country had a few independent media left and now it’s practically none.” The aggressive debunking of “fakes” has become a key component of Russia’s propaganda war in Ukraine. On Monday, the government said that it would begin an investigation into the events in Bucha – not for the alleged war crimes that took place as more than 280 people were killed in the small town, but into the distribution of “fakes” for discrediting the Russian army. And government agencies and television hosts have got to work pointing fingers in every direction – except for at the Kremlin. The quick denials and alternative theories resemble those of a crisis PR agency. Speed and shamelessness are prized above all else. “The behaviour of the government … has changed over the years,” said Ilya Shepelin, a journalist for the banned TV Rain who has reported extensively on Russian news agencies and misinformation. “Ten years ago it would have been easier to keep quiet about an event like Bucha and pretend that nothing was happening and then slowly begin speaking about it.” But with the advent of the internet, and the availability of news on Telegram channels, pretending that nothing has happened has become more difficult. And in that case it is important to muddy the waters as quickly as possible, even if the result is somehow incoherent. “Now, immediately you have to get out front saying it’s all staged, it’s all invented. And if it’s not all staged and invented, then we’re not guilty for it,” he said. “These two ideas are contradictory … but the most important thing is to fight back on all fronts. And hope that one of them catches on with the audience.” Watch Russian TV and that’s what you’ll see. On Sunday evening, Vladimir Soloviev, a top Russian television host, told millions of listeners that the “war against us has entered a new phase. They’re leading us along the Yugoslavia scenario. Now they’ll cook up the scenario of a Srebrenica. We’ll soon be accused of genocide.” He also accused the British of being behind the “provocation”. Another popular talking point, noted by BBC Monitoring’s Francis Scarr, was that the town Bucha was chosen as the site for the provocation for its resemblance to the word “butcher”. Just days earlier, a host noted, Biden had called Putin a “butcher.” And while those narratives played out before millions of Russians on television, state investigators warned anyone spreading independent information about Bucha could face up to 15 years in prison. “The perjury spread by the Ukrainian side is another provocation, a cynical lie and is aimed at discrediting the Russian army in the conditions of the information and propaganda war unleashed by the west,” said the Russian general prosecutor. “The circumstances of the creation and public dissemination of this deliberately false information under the guise of reliable reports will be established, and they will certainly be given an appropriate criminal legal assessment.”",News/World news,Kremlin reverts to type in response to alleged war crimes in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/kremlin-reverts-to-type-in-response-to-alleged-war-crimes-in-ukraine
4/5/2022,"At least 18 “high street titans” – architecturally significant department stores that have fallen victim to profound changes in shopping patterns – are at risk of being permanently lost, according to a new report. But these “cathedrals of commerce”, as Émile Zola described them in his 1883 novel The Ladies’ Paradise, should be granted new lives – as art galleries, residential housing, community hubs and social spaces, says Save Britain’s Heritage. “In a new era when large-scale retail is no longer sustainable, these fine structures are at risk of dilapidation or even demolition … Protecting and reviving these buildings is not only a matter of preserving precious and distinctive architecture; it is an opportunity to restore a sense of place,” says Harriet Lloyd, author of Departing Stores: Emporia at Risk. The report details 46 landmark department stores in town and city centres. Some have been restored or redeveloped while keeping their architectural heritage, but others are vacant and at risk of decay or demolition. “The same loss of relevance previously faced by stately homes, warehouses and many churches now threatens a new building type for the first time: the department store,” the report says. There were 237 vacant department stores in the UK in the middle of 2021, according to the British Retail Consortium and Local Data Company. Nine out of 10 former Debenhams stores were still empty a year after the chain collapsed, and a fifth of former BHS outlets were vacant five years after the company’s demise. The slow decline of the department store began with the creation of shopping centres and out-of-town retail parks in the second half of the last century. It sharply accelerated with the growth of online shopping, assisted by increases in rents and business rates. Between 2006 and 2020, online sales grew to almost 20% of UK retail, and rose further to 30% during the past two years of Covid lockdowns and closures. In the first quarter of 2021, overall retail vacancy was at a five-year high of 14.1%. The report says: “Department stores make up some of the finest and most socially significant buildings on British high streets. Designed to impress and inspire, they are undoubtedly of great architectural merit, and stand as a monument to the historic prosperity of the town.” Marcus Binney, executive president of Save Britain’s Heritage, said: “There can hardly be a sizeable town in Britain which has not suffered the closure of one department store and sometimes several. The race is on to identify and assess these buildings.” Developers were also racing to convert these buildings for new uses. More alarming was “the number of cases where owners are seeking to raze their department stores to the ground with the aim of securing lucrative planning permissions for larger new developments”. Many of the buildings presented significant challenges to conversion, says the report. “Decades of extensions, amalgamations and ad hoc fixes have resulted in labyrinthine interiors of varying levels and ceiling heights, disused staircases and forgotten stockrooms. “Natural light – an enemy to the retailer – is a necessity for homes, hotels and offices, and cannot reach anything in the centre of the deep floor plates. This can make demolition the most attractive option.” Among those at risk according to the report is TJ Hughes in Eastbourne, which was completed in 1926 but has been vacant since May 2019. The building features elegant rusticated pilasters, moulded cartouches and bullseye dormer windows. Plans have now been submitted to demolish the seafront building, and replace it with “a bland apartment block … The irrevocable loss of this detailed and distinctive building would be a real tragedy.” In Nottingham, a former Griffin & Spalding store is “an iconic feature of the city’s historic centre”. Its stone facade, constructed in 1924, is “embellished with sculpted urns, an elaborate cartouche supported by carved cherubs, and a gallery of coupled columns”. The store was bought by Debenhams in 1944, and closed in May 2021. “No future plans are forthcoming for this magnificent edifice,” says the report. But Bobby’s in Bournemouth has been successfully repurposed since it closed as a department store last year. As well as retail space, there is an art gallery, with a food hall and rooftop bar planned. The premises include community spaces, and architectural features are being restored.",Arts/Art and design,"Landmark department stores at risk of being permanently lost, report warns",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/04/landmark-department-stores-at-risk-of-being-permanently-lost-report-warns
4/5/2022,"Virgil van Dijk has said Liverpool are intent on delivering an “unforgettable” season and their pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple should not be taken for granted. Liverpool’s bid to add the Champions League and Premier League to their Carabao Cup triumph has entered a crucial phase with visits to Benfica on Tuesday and Manchester City on Sunday. Before the quarter-final first leg in Lisbon, Van Dijk insisted the high stakes and constant pressure on Jürgen Klopp’s team should be enjoyed, and the position Liverpool are in cherished. The commanding defender, asked whether Liverpool had everything to gain or to lose, replied: “We don’t look at it that way. We just want to make this season hopefully an unforgettable one, for us as players, for the staff but for the whole club. “The things that have been going on at the moment at Liverpool are something that no one should take for granted. As a group we are very stable, we have a fantastic squad, with the manager, the whole relationship with the club and the performances. We should just enjoy it: go out there and give it your all. “If that is enough at the end of the season then happy days. If not then we try again next year. But we shouldn’t take for granted what is happening at the moment.” Klopp’s side are strong favourites to reach the Champions League semi-finals, where they could face either Bayern Munich or Villarreal, and Van Dijk, part of a defence that has conceded only three goals in the last 13 matches, believes Liverpool are well-equipped for the defining stages of the season. He added: “We are definitely more experienced [in big moments]. We have been in the situation where Manchester City is, we have been in Champions League finals, so we have been in this situation before, but you only can influence the game ahead of you and that is how we see it. Tomorrow is going to be a big one of the two that is ahead of us and the only thing we can do is focus on tomorrow.” Lisbon holds happy memories for Klopp. He was on holiday in the Portuguese capital with his family, during an intended one-year sabbatical from the game in 2015, when his agent, Marc Kosicke, called to confirm Liverpool wanted him as manager. “It changed my life,” Klopp said of the call. “We were completely in the holiday mood but there were some rumours around that we didn’t really follow, but with two sons around they pick up pretty much everything and so I knew from them that a couple of things could happen. “The phone rings and I didn’t pick up a lot of phone calls at that time because my family was around, but it was my agent, who is my friend, and when he said Liverpool is calling, the boys were looking at me and in that moment for them the decision was made. Ulla [Klopp’s wife] then had to put the thumb up and it was clear we would do it because it just felt right from the first second.” Almost seven years on and Klopp remains in contention to win a second Champions League and Premier League title as Liverpool manager. His team also have the FA Cup semi-final against City on 16 April. He reflected: “I would love to say we were champions in 2019 as well but we weren’t, and I would love to say we won the Champions League final in 2018 too. That all would have been great, but I don’t judge my time here about the trophies too much. “I know everyone else is doing that, but it is about the way we play and the way we develop and the way the club is and the position the club is in that is much more important. At the moment it is a healthy club in a good situation and these circumstances give you an opportunity to focus on football and that is what we try, but it is really difficult. “The stories on us are very positive in the moment and rightly so, the boys deserve it, but we all know one failure, one little wrong step and at least one competition can be gone so we have to make sure. “There is no problem for us. We don’t feel brave, we just feel ready for the next challenge and that is all I need, but there is no big celebration about the development of the club in the last few years, just really serious work and I am very happy about that.” Benfica are in the quarter-finals for the first time in six years but lie third in the Primeira Liga, 12 points adrift of leaders Porto, following Friday’s 3-2 loss at Braga. Klopp warned: “It is a football playing side, ready to take risks. In the Champions League they overachieve. They were not favourites in their group and they were not favourites against Ajax [in the last 16] but they put them out. They know how to get a result.”",Sport/Football,Virgil van Dijk wants ‘unforgettable’ season as Liverpool chase quadruple,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/04/virgil-van-dijk-wants-unforgettable-season-as-liverpool-chase-quadruple
4/5/2022,"In a defiant victory speech after his electoral landslide, Viktor Orbán reeled off those he perceived as opponents he had “overpowered”. It was a familiar list: “the left at home” – his catch-all phrase for political opponents across the spectrum – then “the international left, the bureaucrats in Brussels”, the “empire” of the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros, the international media – and finally, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. While Zelenskiy is admired across the democratic world for his courageous wartime leadership, in Orbán’s Hungary he is just another opponent. Orbán has condemned the war in Ukraine and supported EU sanctions, but refuses to send Ukraine weapons or even allow military aid to pass through his country, claiming such actions would drag Hungary into the war. Addressing all 27 EU leaders last month, Zelenskiy singled out Orbán, telling him to choose a side in Russia’s war on his country. “Viktor, do you know what’s going on in Mariupol?” he said, drawing a link between the horrors of the besieged city and the murder of Hungarian Jews during the second world war. Asked about the speech in a softball radio interview, Orbán struck an insouciant tone, while championing himself as the defender of Hungarian interests. Dismissing Zelenskiy as “an actor who uses and works with the knowledge he has acquired”, he said he would not comply with any demands that would lead to “our sons dying in someone else’s war” and the “ruination” of Hungary’s economy. While Zelenskiy has repeatedly urged a no-fly zone, he has not called for western forces to enter the ground war. Orbán’s supporters can afford to be less diplomatic. “Zelenskiy is attacking us now,” wrote one pro-government daily. A Fidesz MP, Gyula Budai, accused Zelenskiy of “openly interfering in the Hungarian election campaign”. On the eve of Hungary’s election, Zelenskiy continued his criticism of his western neighbour, describing Orbán as “virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr Putin”. But Zelenskiy’s powerful words neither changed Hungary’s position, nor harmed Orbán at the ballot box. Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi",News/World news,Viktor Orbán adds Zelenskiy to his list of ‘overpowered’ opponents,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/viktor-orban-adds-zelenskiy-to-his-list-of-overpowered-opponents
4/5/2022,"Vladimir Putin has congratulated Hungary’s strongman leader, Viktor Orbán, on his decisive election victory, amid signs that European Union authorities will launch a sanctions process against Budapest that is intended to safeguard EU funds at risk from democratic-backsliding member states. Two members of the European parliament said they expected the European Commission to launch the “rule of law conditionality mechanism” against Hungary, a legal process that could ultimately switch off billions in EU payments to Budapest. EU countries that have government-controlled courts and captured state institutions can be deprived of EU funds, but the law has never been tested. At the European parliament in Brussels on Monday, MEPs expressed shock at Orbán’s victory speech, where he hit out at “opponents”, including a characteristic dig at “Brussels bureaucrats”, but also Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The swaggering speech came just hours after the western world reacted in horror to the atrocities at Bucha and other towns near Kyiv. On Monday, Putin offered his congratulations to Orbán, who is a long-term Kremlin ally, despite Hungary’s support for EU sanctions against Russia. “Despite the difficult international situation, the further development of a bilateral partnership fully accords to the interests of the peoples of Russia and Hungary,” a Kremlin statement said. Britain’s Nigel Farage, France’s Marine Le Pen and Italy’s Matteo Salvini were also quick to congratulate Orbán. “When the people vote, the people win,” tweeted Le Pen, the French far-right leader, who is vying to unseat Emmanuel Macron as president in imminent elections. EU leaders were conspicuously silent on a day when independent election observers at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported that the Hungarian vote was “marred by the absence of a level playing field”. Czech foreign minister Jan Lipavskỷ, a key regional ally, said he was “not satisfied with the election’s result in Hungary”, but had to “seek partners” in his country’s interest. “Hungary must choose its side, and whether they belong to the EU and Nato,” he said. German MEP Daniel Freund, a persistent Orbán critic, said he expected the commission to trigger the rule of law mechanism within days. “My understanding is that the triggering of the conditionality against Hungary could happen, possibly as early as this week,” he told reporters. “The financial pressure will start to be felt rather quickly if the commission would move,” he said adding, even if the EU process took months to unfold, it could be harder for Budapest to borrow money. Petri Sarvamaa, a centre-right Finnish MEP, said, based on his understanding, the commission was going to trigger the process within days, but added that Hungary posed far deeper questions. Europe could be approaching a historic moment, he said. “We are facing existential issues. These are totalitarian authoritarian regimes vis-a-vis the democratic world and Orbán seems to be willing to be part of that [first] camp.” “We appeased Viktor Orbán … and we, the union, appeased Vladimir Putin. And if we continue on this path.. We will find ourselves obsolete.” László Andor, a Hungarian former European commissioner, said that he expected the commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, “to hesitate” on next steps. “Dealing with Hungary is not the strongest performance of the Von der Leyen commission,” he said. “There has been a huge amount of prevarication.” Andor, who is affiliated to the opposition Socialist party, added: “For Hungary it is obviously terrible to remain in the grip of Orbán so severely, and the political landscape also shows this massive division between Budapest and the rest of the country.” Orbán’s stunning victory was likely to increase his confidence against the EU, analysts predicted. “He will be very self-confident in his policies,” said Daniel Hegedüs, a visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund, who also expects Orbán’s government to “simply steal policy ideas from the radical right” after it emerged that the far-right Our Homeland party was set to enter parliament for the first time. “Potentially there would be a very pragmatic balancing game on the side of the European Commission: on the one hand not provoking Hungary into blocking EU decision making in the council, but on the other hand … not being too soft and too accommodating. It would be fatal if there would be only accommodation.” Orbán will also have to mend fences with allies in central Europe, who have criticised his refusal to aid Ukraine with weapons or to allow arms to travel through Hungary. A meeting of four central European defence ministers was cancelled last week after the Czech defence minister accused Hungary of valuing “cheap Russian oil” over Ukrainian blood. But there were signs of a rapprochement between Warsaw and Budapest, when Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, who favours tough sanctions on Russia, avoided criticising Hungary for its opposition to an oil embargo. “It’s Germany that is the main roadblock on sanctions,” he said. “Hungary is for the sanctions,” he claimed. While Poland and Hungary are sharply opposed over their approach to Russia, the nationalist governments share common ground in their fight against Brussels over the rule of law. “Relations will be a bit colder than they used to be,” Hegedüs said. “But they also have areas of joint interest and I think they will very closely co-operate in those areas.” Dutch liberal lawmaker Sophie in ‘t Veld described Orbán’s reelection as “a disaster” for Hungarians. “It also means that he will sit on the European Council [of EU leaders] – a very powerful EU governance body that shapes laws for all Europeans – as someone who has been elected through rigged elections,” she said, as the OSCE issued its critical report, highlighting “biased” news coverage and the blurred line between party and state. “The magnitude of this problem has to sink in,” the MEP said.",News/World news,Victory of Putin ally Orbán in Hungary may trigger freeze on EU funding,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/victory-of-putin-ally-orban-in-hungary-may-trigger-freeze-on-eu-funding
4/5/2022,"The US Secret Service is paying more than $30,000 a month to rent a Malibu mansion, in order to protect Hunter Biden. To house agents protecting Joe Biden’s son, the agency has rented a Spanish-style estate that according to a property listing features “gorgeous ocean views” and “resort style living at its finest”. In addition to six bedrooms, six baths, a gym, a tasting room and a guesthouse, the property features a built-in barbecue space, pool and a spa. The house also has a spiral staircase that leads to a “castle-like tower … the master retreat with a wet bar”, thereby offering “a perfect retreat for discerning clientele”. The mansion is close to Hunter Biden’s own rented mansion, for which he is reportedly paying about $20,000 a month. That sum gets the president’s son a four-bedroom, three-bathroom “resort-style” home with French doors, alfresco dining and vaulted ceilings. The Secret Service chose its property so it could be as close as possible to Biden, according to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to ABC News. The agency said: “Due to the need to maintain operational security, the US Secret Service does not comment on the means, methods, or resources used to conduct our protective operations.” The use of taxpayer funds to protect presidential families has come under growing scrutiny. During the presidency of Donald Trump, the Secret Service announced that it was running out of money to protect the president’s family. In the first year of the Trump administration, the agency requested an additional $60m to fulfill such duties. The Secret Service is required by law to pay whatever is required to rent rooms near its clients. Presidents continue to receive protection after leaving office. Last year, Trump charged the Secret Service nearly $10,200 for the use of guest rooms at his New Jersey golf club. In 2021, reports emerged that the Secret Service had to rent a basement studio in Washington DC for the sole purpose of allowing agents to go to the toilet, after Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner refused to let their security detail use bathrooms in their house. The rental cost taxpayers about $3,000 a month. During the Barack Obama administration, a family trip to Martha’s Vineyard in 2016 cost the agency $2.7m, according to records obtained by Judicial Watch, a rightwing watchdog. The Secret Service spent $2.5m on hotels and $90,000 on rental cars. When the Obama family visited Honolulu in late 2016, the agency spent $1.9m, including $1.8m on hotels. Michelle Obama’s trips to Aspen, Colorado from 2014 to 2016 cost the agency more than $319,000. The 2016 trip cost $166,000 alone.

4/5/2022,"Tiger Woods’s domination of the 1997 Masters was such that only the tournament within the tournament behind him was competitive. He prevailed by a dozen shots. Six separated Tom Kite, who was second, from those who tied for 17th. Paul Stankowski will return to the galleries at Augusta National this week with memories of 25 years ago reverberating inside his head. Stankowski is an interesting case; he missed the cut on his Masters debut in 1996 and finished in a share of fifth a year later before finishing 39th in 1998. He was never to play in the Masters, which is held in Georgia, again. Stankowski’s 1997 experience involved fine margins and one freakish moment. He was the first round leader, having posted a 68, until John Huston holed his second shot to the 18th from the middle of the 10th. “Who hits it on the 10th fairway playing 18?” he asks, still bewildered more than two decades on. By Saturday, Stankowski sensed the chance to play alongside Woods on what would be a final round for the ages. “I had 10ft from behind the hole on 18,” the Californian, now 52, recalls. “I reckon if I make it, I’m in the last group. I miss that putt then [Costantino] Rocca comes along a group or two behind me. He has 20ft; if he misses it, I get Tiger. He made it and got to witness history. I played with Tom Kite and played like a dog, shooting two over, in front of my Ryder Cup captain. I knew my chances of making the Ryder Cup were done there. I knew I didn’t impress him. Had I needed a pick, I knew I wasn’t going to get it. That last day was a tough one for me. I was disappointed. “I joke about how I could have altered history with that 10ft putt on Saturday. Truth be told, nothing would have changed. Tiger was destined to win and destined to be great. For my generation he is the best player who has ever lived. It was pretty cool to almost share the spotlight with him.” Indeed, Woods triumphed while pulling away. His 54-hole advantage was nine. By the time he added a 69 to earlier rounds of 70, 66 and 65, a world far beyond golf was paying attention. This was Woods’s first Masters appearance as a professional – though he played at Augusta in 1995 and 1996 as an amateur. Bill Clinton, then president of the United States, was among those to offer immediate post-tournament congratulations. Nick Faldo has always summed up 1997 appropriately. The defending champion partnered Woods during rounds one and two. Woods famously delivered a Thursday front half of four over par that was improved by 10 over the inward nine. “He went out in 40 then we didn’t see him for 14 years,” Faldo says. “He left us all in the dust.” Woods cited nervousness for his initial struggles. “I played shaky,” he said. Stankowski, playing directly in front of Faldo and Woods, admits to having a chuckle to himself when seeing the latter’s early problems. “Then, quickly, we started hearing the roars.” They continued for another three days; golf had a new icon. “I was asked by the media on Saturday afternoon: ‘Is it over?’” Stankowski adds. “I said: ‘Well, if somebody gets hot tomorrow and makes five or six birdies in the first two or three holes, maybe they can catch him.’ The guy peeked out, perplexed, from behind the camera. If Tiger wasn’t there that week, it would have been a lot more exciting for the rest of the field.” But was Woods’s subsequent greatness easy to foresee? “Even then, we still had no idea,” says Stankowski. “I predicted Tiger Woods was going to win a lot of golf tournaments. He could dominate a lot of courses with his length. But then we really started to see his mental fortitude, the mindset. He entered the property on a mission.” Stankowski, who left the PGA Tour in 2013, now regularly plays Monday qualifiers and seeks invites to feature on the Champions Tour. This feels a far cry from chasing a Green Jacket, including in the company of Tom Watson. He won twice on the PGA Tour, once in Atlanta in the week before the 1996 Masters and finally in Hawaii in early 1997. “I was on a really good run,” he says. “1997 was my most consistent year. I figured the sky was the limit, I was still getting better. But, not for a lack of effort, it just didn’t happen. 1998 wasn’t a very good year, things kept getting worse. I got injured at the end of 2002 and that was it for my really good golf. For me, playing on the tour was a dream. I got to do that for 20 years but my really good play came in probably less than two years. That’s just the nature of the game; how many athletes are picked out as amazing and before you know it, you’ve forgotten about them? “When you are in the midst of good golf you don’t know how long it will last. You can have aspirations and dreams all you want but ultimately you don’t know. Right now, Scottie Scheffler is the best golfer in the world. For all intents and purposes that could last for 10 years or 10 weeks. You have no idea. I admire what Tiger and Phil Mickelson have done because it’s so hard to be the best or among the best for a long period.” Before departing Augusta on 13 April 1997, Woods was directly asked whether he was going to be the greatest golfer the world had ever seen. “I don’t know about that,” he replied. “I do know my goal is to be the best. I know that’s a very lofty goal but I will try to accomplish it. If I do that, great, if I don’t, I tried. I expect nothing but the best for myself.” A further 14 major wins later, it is safe to say Woods delivered on early promise. And some.

4/5/2022,"From playing in the park to watching their parents interact with other adults, children have missed out on a lot of experiences during the pandemic. Research now suggests that this has resulted in delays to children’s emotional, social and physical development. Many parents will be worried, but the main piece of advice from experts is that it is not your responsibility to bear alone. Here are their tips on how you can help. What are the signs my child is struggling?This depends on the individual child as well as their age, but parents should look out for any changes in their behaviour, said Prof Iram Siraj, who leads the child development and learning group at the University of Oxford and advises the Department for Education on child development.“There are unforeseen [effects of lockdown] we haven’t thought about. We need to observe children as parents and teachers and think about what’s going on for that child and not carry on working the way we normally do,” she said.Parents should talk to their children as much as possible about their experience of the pandemic, what they’re struggling with and how they feel, she added. Parents should also be aware of their own stress levels, because this can influence their children. You shouldn’t feel guilty if you leave their children in front of a screen for a bit, or talk to other parents about how you’re feeling, Siraj said. The latter creates what is known as the “school-gate effect”, in which parents exchange tips with each other that improve their parenting skills.Prof Gemma Moss at UCL’s education institute said parents should raise any concerns with their child’s teacher, because they are best placed to assist directly at nursery or school, or to signpost more formal help if required. She also recommended looking at the free resources from the Anna Freud Centre, a mental health charity for children and families. How much should I worry about this?The main message from the experts is not to panic. You alone are not responsible. Many children are in a similar position and schools have lots of experience in helping them catch up.Moss said children from very disadvantaged backgrounds – living in temporary accommodation, for example – were experiencing most problems and that it was the government’s job to improve their environment.She thinks that some of the comments from Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, unfairly shift the burden of responsibility onto parents. “Most parents have done a fine job and have no reason to worry,” she said.Some children have emerged from the pandemic having developed skills to a higher level than they would otherwise have done. Those who have read more books, for example, have higher literacy levels, said Siraj. Parents should not conclude, however, that their children spending more time at home is better, because they might be doing well academically but have higher anxiety levels.What can I do to help?Take your child out as much as possible, because even small things like a random conversation with a stranger or interaction with a cashier help develop their social skills. Try to read to them as much as possible. “Use books rather than screen time because what children need to develop is language, and reading is knowledge of the world,” said Siraj.Finding time for “expressive, collaborative” play and to engage in physical activity is also important, even if it’s just building dens in the house, although getting outside matters too. “Many parents don’t play games with their children. They have no idea how much children learn around literacy, self regulation, socialising, numbers [through games],” Siraj said.Seeking out opportunities for children to socialise with others and develop their understanding of the world via role-play games is another key step.

4/5/2022,"Owen Hatherley (We trash our modernist heritage on a whim: why is Britain so in thrall to the wrecking ball?, 31 March) is right that our cities will only flourish if we get the balance right between conserving everything and giving developers a free-for-all. In theory, the listing system ensures that the best of each era is saved from destruction, and the overall mix gets richer and richer. But, as Hatherley notes, listing is a “blunt instrument” and one that developers are all too skilled at manipulating. It’s true that it suits them to maintain that listing 20th-century buildings is still controversial. In fact, conservation is now pretty broad-minded and has got over the fact that many of the outstanding modernist buildings now listed sit on top of the rubble of great Victorian ones – none of them is going to be magicked back into existence by the punitive demolition of the former. We have a great chance to make sure we don’t make the same mistake again. Now that we understand the impact of demolition on climate change, there is all the more reason to prioritise reusing structures on environmental grounds – there are still plenty of sites for new masterpieces (only 2% of building stock is listed). As with cherished buildings of previous eras, the best 20th-century examples deserve gentle conservation. We should stop trashing our modernist heritage.Catherine CroftDirector, Twentieth Century Society, London  The problem with Owen Hatherley’s plea for preserving the modernist buildings of the 1960s and 70s is that at almost no point does he mention the people who have to live or work in them. Does he live in a concrete tower block 25 storeys up, where the lifts break down, or shop in a bleak, windswept precinct with bits falling off the facade? While no one would dispute that towns and cities need to evolve, the reality is that many examples of modernism were plonked down without regard to history, geography, local materials or traditions, or to the practicalities of everyday life. The whole Le Corbusier idea of modernism was basically monumental, inhuman in scale and rather authoritarian. Architecture can be both functional and attractive. If we have to still look to the distant past for beauty, so be it. But modernism was never about compromise with the past, or even how people want to live. It failed for the same reason that the Victorian gothic style ultimately failed. They were better in small doses, not the often large-scale blitzkrieg of urban centres and communities.Garth GroombridgeSouthampton  Owen Hatherley expertly highlights the dilemma facing town planners, who seem to fall into two distinct groups – those who approach each building as a separate design problem to be solved, and those with a long-term vision for whom the completed city centre was a concept influencing their design approach. I grew up in Coventry, where wartime destruction gave architects the opportunity to produce a grand plan. What happened was more like a series of changes which, in many cases, had to be rethought. The Precinct shopping area was later demolished, as it became apparent that the first floor, reached by an external stairway, was highly unpopular with shoppers. The contrast with Birmingham is striking. There, someone saw the bigger picture and a walk from Brindley Place along to Symphony Hall is a pleasant experience for anyone attuned to the visual stimuli afforded by attractive buildings situated in harmony with each other. I wish I could be more loyal to the city of my childhood, but the older parts will always be what I remember most fondly.Bob CaldwellDaventry, Northamptonshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/5/2022,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), made up of the world’s leading climate scientists, has now published all three sections of its landmark comprehensive review of climate science. Working group 1, published in August 2021, covered the physical basis of climate science, delving deeply into atmospheric chemistry and physics. It found that humanity was “unequivocally” to blame for major and “unprecedented” changes to the climate that were already being observed, and that some of these changes – including polar ice melt – were rapidly becoming “irreversible”. Working group 2, published in February 2022, dealt with the impacts of the climate crisis. It found that nowhere on Earth would escape the dire impacts, including heatwaves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels. Half of the global population is already “highly vulnerable”, mass die-offs of species are already under way, coastal areas face inundation at temperature rises of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and key ecosystems are losing their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Working group 3, published on 4 April 2022, set out the ways in which the world can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It found that countries were falling behind on the policies and actions needed to reach net zero emissions, and on current form could see temperatures rise by as much as 3C, a catastrophic level. Drastic changes will be needed to all aspects of the global economy and society, to phase out dependence on fossil fuels. Staving off the worst consequences predicted by the first two working groups is still possible, but only if governments take immediate and decisive action. This is the IPCC’s sixth assessment report, bringing together all of the world’s knowledge of the climate, since it was set up in 1988. Drawing on the work of thousands of scientists, from research papers published over the last eight years, the final report was supposed to be published last year but was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced the key discussions to take place online. Scientists will draw up one further document: a synthesis report in October, taking in the key messages from all three working groups. This will be given to policymakers before the next UN climate summit, Cop27 in Egypt this November, at which governments are being urged to set out clear policies and goals in line with halving greenhouse gas emissions this decade and reaching net zero by 2050. Yet the picture could already be even worse than the IPCC has presented. The IPCC data took in research papers published from 2014 up to last year, but since then the world has experienced even more extreme weather. The IPCC reports are regarded as cautious and conservative by many scientists, and the summary for policymakers that sets out the key messages of each working group are subject to inputs from governments that some regard as watering down. Last month, the Arctic and Antarctic saw unprecedented simultaneous heatwaves in both polar regions, prompting some scientists to warn that changes were happening much faster than the IPCC had predicted. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Centre at Pennsylvania State University, told the Guardian: “The models have done a good job projecting the overall warming, but we’ve argued that extreme events are exceeding model projections.” Mark Maslin, professor of earth system science at University College London, added: “I and colleagues were shocked by the number and severity of the extreme weather events in 2021, which were unexpected at a [current] warming of 1.2C. Now we have record temperatures in the Arctic which, for me, showed we have entered a new extreme phase of climate change much earlier than we had expected.”",News/Environment,Why are the three IPCC working group reports significant?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/why-are-the-three-ipcc-working-group-reports-significant
4/5/2022,"Since when did restaurants become a maths lecture, and why are people so eager to turn their bodies into calculators? I agree with Clare Finney (Putting calories on menus won’t solve obesity, but it will harm those of us with eating disorders, 1 April). Too many people continue to argue that compulsory calorie labelling will be beneficial and make them more aware of what they are consuming, but isn’t it sad that we can no longer listen to our bodies and make the right choices for ourselves without having to turn eating, an innate survival instinct, into some form of regimented algebra? The proportion of eating disorder sufferers in the UK may be a minority, but it is a large one – nearly 2%. For context, people dependent on alcohol make up about 0.9% of the population. Almost two-thirds of the population are considered overweight or obese. Aside from the fact that the measurement used to determine this, the BMI scale, was developed in the 1830s without the scientific basis that would make it valid today, it is not fair or reasonable to implement a measure that is meant to benefit the majority, but with no conclusive scientific evidence of doing so, to the detriment of a large minority. Many more people than those officially diagnosed suffer from symptoms of disordered eating – such as obsessive calorie counting. It’s a compulsion. Calorie labelling is for us what forcing wine on everyone who walks into a restaurant would be for recovering alcoholics. You know you shouldn’t, but you can’t help it. It should be an opt-in, rather than an opt-out system, so that it’s not damaging to the millions of people with mental health problems.

4/5/2022,"The House of Lords will be carefully scrutinising and voting on controversial aspects of the government’s elections bill this month. You report (31 March) that UK citizens living overseas for more than 15 years may now be able to vote in general elections. The issue of them being able to give unlimited sums of money to political parties is much more controversial. In 2009, parliament decided that UK citizens who are resident abroad for tax purposes should not be able to donate to political parties. But since then, the government has maintained that it is administratively too difficult to ban such donations and that someone’s tax status is confidential. This means that a billionaire tax exile who remains a UK citizen will be able to donate millions for the rest of their lives. In the absence of a general cap on the size of donations to political parties, it cannot be right that such non-doms could have massive influence on our elections. The government has also announced plans to raise the legal limit that parties can spend in the year before a general election by as much as 80%.

4/5/2022,"First Pedri González put Ivan Rakitic on the floor, next he put Diego Carlos on the floor and then, allowing time to speed up again, he put Yassine Bono on the floor and 76,112 people on their feet. And that’s just those who were in the ground chanting his name, bowing before him. Because if Sevilla fell for the quiet lad who comes to the Camp Nou with his kit in a carrier bag on Sunday night, so did everyone else. “Pedri, Pedri, Pedri,” went the cover of Sport, like a kid calling on the Candyman and soon there he was, pretty much everywhere. “Madness,” he said, smiling slightly once it was over. Only it wasn’t over. Pedri’s goal had defeated Sevilla 1-0 but this was just beginning, both on Sunday and beyond. If Sport named him three times, Barcelona went for 40. He had acted as their “messiah”, El Mundo wrote. “Pedri provides the music,” El Periódico said. “Astonishing,” El País called him, “evocative of Messi and Ronaldinho.” El Mundo Deportivo declared him “wonderful, magisterial, unforgettable”. And while it’s an idea not to use up the superlatives, if only because he’s 19 and you get the feeling you’ll need them again, it was a bit good. There was a little over quarter of an hour left and it was 0-0 between Barcelona and Sevilla, second place at stake, when Pedri got the ball and pressed pause. It was noisy at the Camp Nou, the second highest crowd of the season – well, the third – and it was tense too, but that didn’t matter: he’s a teenager and he’s timid, his manager says, yet nervousness isn’t his thing, not once he’s out there. So the kid who says he plays like he’s back home in the garden with his brother and who had walked the ball in against Galatasaray in Istanbul a fortnight ago, defenders sliding by and out of shot, did much the same on Sunday. Only from further away. “If I see legs, I cut back,” Pedri said afterwards. Receiving the ball on the edge of the area, in no hurry in the middle of a frantic crowd, he could see a lot of them. Rakitic flew at him so he applied the brakes, a moment’s still as the game whizzed by, not so much going past his opponent as inviting his opponent to go past him. Diego Carlos did the same, and so he calmly repeated the manoeuvre, a second cartoon character sent careering off the cliff. And then Pedri accelerated and hit a shot that raced into the far corner beyond Bono, the place erupting. As he ran off, teammates grabbed him, threw him to the ground and piled on top, Dani Alves using his body as bongo drums. “FJHGHFHKGBHFDGBHFBHBHJSBHGFQBGHJBHSBHFSABHJGBHF,” responded the club’s Twitter account, which is at least as coherent as most tweets and as expertly typed as anything this here computer has ever experienced. The coach, Xavi Hernández, responded by leaping into the assistant coach Óscar, brothers in arms. He began not so much punching the air as trying to knock it out. “The ball didn’t want to go in and there was a feeling of anger and impotence,” he explained afterwards. This was big, after all. Sevilla were the only team that could realistically challenge Real Madrid for the title and now Pedri’s goal had lifted Barcelona above them and into second. Few believe Barcelona can actually win the league: Madrid’s 2-1 win at Celta on Saturday leaves them 12 points ahead having played a game more, with eight weeks left – the same gap Xavi inherited, it might be worth noting. But they have climbed seven places. Madrid and Barcelona hadn’t been the top two since the end of the 2019-20 season, this was Barca’s sixth league win in a row, their 14th game without defeat, and they have beaten Atlético, Real Madrid and now Sevilla. It had been difficult on Sunday, chances slipping away, tension growing, but they had found a way through. Pedri had. Nor was it just the goal, which might not even have been the weekend’s best – Real Betis’s William Carvalho and Álex Moreno scored beauties against Osasuna, slightly similar to this and even more like the one Pedri got at Galatasaray. Asked, a little giddily perhaps, if this strike would go down in history, Sevilla’s sporting director replied: “I don’t know about that, but it’s a great goal from a player who might.” The sense of control and calm goes beyond the moment itself to a player quietly taking responsibility for a team emerging as challengers again. “The leader of the opposition,” AS called him, and it was nice to know there is one. Injured at the start of the season, Pedri has now played 11 league games. He hasn’t lost any of them. When the goal went in and the Camp Nou chanted his name, the echoes were inescapable, even if they were exaggerated. Even Sport’s “Pedri, Pedri, Pedri” had been done before, only with Messi. So had the Candyman line, but hey, come on, it’s 15 years ago now. In El Periódico, Marcos López described the Camp Nou as “Pedri’s garden”, a line he always used for the Argentinian. One columnist even claimed: “Pedri rhymes with Messi.” Which it doesn’t, and it would be wise not to get carried away for everyone’s sake, but Pedri has already done something Messi never managed – he has played at the Carlos Tartiere – and that he is different, and may be the future, is not just an invention for a one-off moment. This wasn’t entirely new. Pedri provided the pass for Messi to score his 644th Barcelona goal, another sign of something special. On Cadena Ser radio, commentator Lluis Flaquer has long referred to him as Pedri Potter. Golden Boy winner, the Euros announced him to the world and so did his coach, another more pertinent parallel drawn than the one likening him to Messi. “Anyone who knows anything about football knows that no one has ever seen that from anybody at 18, not even Sir Andrés Iniesta,” Luis Enrique insisted in the summer. “It’s incredible, just unique.” The man who coached Spain before Luis Enrique agreed. “He’s special, one of those players that only comes along every so often,” Julen Lopetegui said after he was finally defeated by Pedri on Sunday night. The first day Iniesta trained with the Barcelona team, Luis Enrique was the player sent up to meet him and show him to the dressing room. Over the coming years, no one was closer to Iniesta than Xavi and, like Luis Enrique, he too sees something of his former teammate in the player he now coaches. The quality of the touch and the timing. The control and clarity, the understanding, the management of the match and its moments. The awareness of his superiority, even if only at some subconscious level, that is implicit in his willingness to ask the ball and hold it – not for his sake but for theirs, an act of responsibility. “It’s wonderful watching Pedri play. In terms of talent, I haven’t seen a player in the world like him,” Xavi said a month or so ago. “And I’m not saying that to eulogise him because he doesn’t like that. There are players with different characteristics, like De Bruyne or Modric, but not with his talent. He reminds me of Iniesta. If we’re talking pure talent, he’s the best in the world.” Pulled up on those remarks, Xavi later insisted that Iniesta, “the greatest talent I’ve ever seen”, had a career that couldn’t be equalled but he insisted the comparison came out “naturally” and doubled down on it, “even if I get criticised for it”. It is not one he only expresses publicly, done for effect, and the analytics confirm it too: the things that need to be taught to others come naturally to Pedri. This was his eighth Barcelona goal: he is no goalscorer but he has got there 68 games faster than Iniesta. “He controls space and time,” Xavi said. “We’re encouraging him to shoot more.” On Sunday night he did, but not just like that and not until the moment was made, two men left on the floor and thousands more on their feet, path cleared with a pause.
