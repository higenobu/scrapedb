3/17/2022,"What quiet, splintering performances. Starting as a light-hearted portrait of a charming family, this 1978 play devolves into a deeply felt character study of three individuals pulling unhappily in different directions. Written by German playwright Franz Xaver Kroetz and translated by Estella Schmid and Anthony Vivis, this production of Tom Fool is a gentle exploration of the way money wriggles its way into the existing rifts of everyday life, adding pressure until they crack. At the head of the family is aggravating Otto, a car mechanic played with a remarkable elasticity by Michael Shaeffer, at once utterly proud and deeply unhappy in himself. Putting up with him is Anna Francolini’s unrufflable Martha, longing to find a life beyond housework and orders. Lounging around them is son Ludwig (Jonah Rzeskiewicz), desperate to forge his own path. Kroetz beautifully writes jolts of everyday life in this family, as days are derailed by the ordinary things that worry away at us. These fragments start sparse and comedic, but gain weight as we go on, with work and worth becoming inextricably intertwined. Conversations about money run through every outing and argument, with every single mark accounted for. Special meals out are ruined by fears of being duped by the waiters, and when they watch the royal wedding on television, all Otto can think of is how much it cost. Pride is a key player too, as Ludwig wants to get a job as a bricklayer to start earning his own money, but Otto refuses to let his son become “just” a worker like him; they have to be seen to be going up in the world. When Otto rages and messes up the house, Martha measures the financial damage. Diyan Zora’s production is soft and tactile, with every nervous glance adding to our understanding of the family’s shifting dynamics. On a naturalistic set designed by Zoë Hurwitz, with brown fold-out sofa and ceiling fan, the realism is interrupted with flashes of projected scene titles. These add another touch of humour to the already sharp comedy of their conversations. Tom Fool is an astute realisation of the limits of class, of dissatisfaction, and the failure to achieve childhood dreams. But as the characters focus increasingly on the way their jobs define them in this capitalist world, Martha and Ludwig start to break out of the other boundaries they’re restricted by. Equal parts bleak and funny, Zora has staged a tender portrayal of a finely drawn family struggling to weigh up what their love is worth.

3/17/2022,"Good morning. The Ukrainian president has drawn parallels between Russia’s siege of the southern city of Mariupol and that of Leningrad during the second world war, as Russian forces continued to shell Kyiv. “Citizens of Russia, how is your blockade of Mariupol different from the blockade of Leningrad during world war two?” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Wednesday, referring to the German blockade of the city now called St Petersburg, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. “We will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers.” Zelenskiy’s remarks came after Joe Biden significantly toughened his rhetoric against Vladimir Putin, calling the Russian president a “war criminal”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Biden’s comments were “unacceptable and unforgivable”. How many have been killed in Mariupol? Local officials estimated that more than 2,500 people had been killed but the shelling meant the dead could not be counted. More than 400,000 were either without access to running water, food and medical supplies or struggling with a dwindling amount. Russia launched an airstrike on a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of displaced people were believed to have been sheltering. Zelenskiy said it was unclear how many had died or been injured. What is the US doing? It will send an extra $800m in security assistance to Ukraine, including 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 anti-armour systems, 20m rounds of ammunition and drones. Texas discarded an abnormally high number of mail-in ballots in the US’s first primary election of 2022, with almost 23,000 votes thrown out as the Republican campaign to reshape US democracy got under way, according to analysis by the Associated Press. About 13% of mail ballots returned in the 1 March primary were rejected across 187 counties in Texas. Experts say anything above 2% is unusual. “My first reaction is ‘yikes’,” said Charles Stewart, the director of the Election Data and Science Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It says to me that there is something seriously wrong with the way that the mail ballot policy is being administered.” Were votes rejected at the same rate across counties? No. The rejection rate was higher in counties that lean Democratic (15.1%) than Republican (9.1%). Are tougher voting laws in Texas unique? No. The state is the first to cast ballots under more restrictive voting rules but at least 17 other states will do so in the coming months. At least one Trump White House aide was involved in covertly producing a report that alleged the former president lost to Joe Biden because of Dominion voting systems. The research was a key part of Donald Trump’s wider efforts to subvert the election. The Dominion report was initially written to be sent to legislatures in states where Trump was trying to have Biden’s win overturned. The Trump team also used it to lend credence to returning the former president to power by other means, including executive orders to give him drastic emergency powers. The document made a number of unsubstantiated claims, alleging Dominion systems corruptly guaranteed there could be “technology glitches which resulted in thousands of votes being added to Biden’s total ballot count”. Who was listed as the author? The report names Katherine Friess, a volunteer on the Trump post-election legal team, as its author on the cover and in metadata. She has said she had nothing to do with it and does not know why her name was on the document. Who was the real author and why was their name removed? It was produced by a senior Trump White House policy aide, Joanna Miller, according to a source and an earlier version of the file, but it is not clear why her name was removed. She did not respond to a request for comment. British-Iranian prisoners Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori have been freed by Iran and have been reunited with their families in the UK. A third dual national accused of spying, the businessman and wildlife conservationist Morad Tahbaz, has been freed from prison on furlough. A group of New Orleans residents whose homes were built on a toxic landfill decades ago have won a $75.3m court judgment. Homes built in the 1970s and 80s were marketed to Black, low- and middle-income residents who were not informed that the site had been landfill. The former CNN host Chris Cuomo is seeking $125m in damages for alleged wrongful termination. He was fired in December after an inquiry into his efforts to advise his brother, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Chris Cuomo says he was transparent and had “no reason to believe” this violated the network’s policies. Armando Linares López, the director of the Michoacán Monitor news website, has become the eighth journalist to be killed in Mexico this year. Nine were killed in 2021. López was shot in the conflict-ridden state of Michoacán six weeks after he announced the murder of a colleague. Efforts to save Staten Island’s vanishing coastline involve oysters – and lots of them. Restoration projects such as Living Breakwaters use recycled oyster shells to create reefs in the breakwaters, which aim to help control flooding as the reefs grow while creating aquatic habitats and limiting erosion. When scientists set out to photograph a star 2,000 light years away and 100 times fainter than the human eye can see, the background stole the show.

3/17/2022,"Inflation is a disease that disproportionately afflicts the poor. Even before Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war on Ukraine, whose byproducts include soaring energy and food prices, inflation was already over 7.5% in the US and above 5% in Europe and the UK. Calls for its taming are, therefore, fully justified – and the interest rate rise in the US, with the same expected in the UK, comes as no surprise. That said, we know from history that the cure for inflation tends to devastate the poor even more. The new wrinkle we face today is that the supposed solutions threaten not only to deal another cruel blow to the disadvantaged but, ominously, to snuff out the desperately needed green transition. Two influential camps dominate public discourse on inflation and what to do about it. One camp demands that the inflationary flames be smothered immediately by the monetary policy version of shock and awe: raise interest rates sharply to choke expenditure. They warn that delaying a little monetary violence now will only necessitate “Volcker shock” levels of brutality later – a reference to Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve chair who quelled the hyperinflation of the 1970s with sky-high interest rates that scarred the American working class to this day. The second camp protests that this is unnecessary, counter-proposing a steady as she goes stance for as long as wage inflation is kept on a leash. The two camps agree that rising wages are the real threat, their disagreement focusing only on whether it is prudent to act before or after they start picking up. They agree also that, to fight inflation, the supply of money and credit must be dealt with in a two-step sequence: central banks must first stop creating new money and only then raise interest rates. The two camps are dangerously wrong on both counts. First, wage inflation should be welcomed, not treated like public enemy number one. Second, it is precisely when interest rates are rising that central banks should continue to create money. Except this time, they should press it into the service of green investments and social welfare. Since 2008, inequality has been allowed to rise. A dozen years of central bank support for the rich, coupled with punitive austerity for the many, has led to chronic underinvestment and low wages. Central banks plucked the money tree ferociously to boost share and house prices, while wages languished. Asset-price inflation and mind-numbing inequality thus became the order of the day. Eventually almost everyone agreed, including many of the mega-rich, that wages had to rise not just in the interests of workers but also because low wages underpinned underinvestment and created societies bristling with low productivity, low skills, low prospects and poisonous politics. Remarkably, all it took for this consensus to vanish was a modest, by historical standards, wage inflation brought on by a post-lockdown labour shortfall. After a decade of turning a blind eye to rampaging asset-price inflation (even celebrating it, in the case of crazy house prices and boisterous stock markets), a whiff of wage inflation threw the authorities into an almost uncontrollable panic. Suddenly, the prospect of rising wages turned from an objective to a menace – prompting Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, to ask workers to place their wage demands under “quite clear restraint”. But this isn’t a rerun of the 1970s, when the working class was the only casualty of interest rate rises. What’s critically different is that, today, a Volcker shock may well smother the green transition along with a large part of labour’s share of national income. The counter-argument is, of course, that neither workers nor society’s capacity to invest in the green transition will benefit from wage rises that are overtaken by rising prices. True. What is also true, however, is that a monetary policy that prioritises the prevention of wage inflation will, even if successful at nipping inflation in the bud, only lead to another wasted decade marked by underinvestment in people and nature. While the working classes may rise up 10 years from now to claim the share of aggregate income that they deserve, it is arguable that another 10 years of underinvestment in the green transition will push us all to the brink of, if not extinction, irreparable damage to humanity’s prospects. So how do we deal with inflation without jeopardising investment in the green transition? What is the alternative to a class war in the form of a blunt interest-rate policy that squeezes the supply of money across the board either violently (as the advocates of shock and awe propose) or more gently (the steady as she goes suggestion)? A decent alternative policy must have three goals: first, to repress asset prices (such as house and share prices) so as to stop scarce financial resources being wasted in building up paper values. Second, to push down the prices of basic goods while allowing for higher returns to investment in green energy and transport. Third, to deliver massive investment in energy conservation and green energy, transport, agriculture – as well as social housing and care. The following threefold policy agenda can achieve these three goals. First, raise interest rates substantially. Ultra-low interest rates have failed to boost investment – and, in any case, were never available to those who either needed to borrow money or wanted to borrow to do things society needed. All ultra-low rates did was to boost house prices, share prices, inequality and all those things that divide society. But, second, this must be done in concert with a massive central bank-supported green public investment drive. Naturally, raising interest rates will not boost investment, even if it is true that next to zero interest rates also did little to help investment. To escape the low-investment quagmire, the central bank should announce a new type of quantitative easing: it should stop financing the financiers and, instead, promise to stand behind (by buying, if needs be) public green bonds that raise funds to the tune of 5% of national income annually – a sum that will be invested directly into the green transition, giving society a fighting chance to do what it must to stabilise the climate. Third, extend the same public finance model (that is, getting the central bank to stand behind public bonds) to invest in social housing and care. In short, what I am proposing is a reversal of the toxic policies implemented since 2008. Instead of central banks providing free money and low interest rates to the rich, while the rest languish in the prison of austerity, the central bank ought to make money more expensive for the rich (through significant interest rate rises) while providing cheap money for investing into the things the majority and the lived environment both need and deserve.

3/17/2022,"A twin growth and inflation blow to the global economy from the war in Ukraine will require governments to provide help with rising energy bills to hard-pressed consumers, the west’s leading thinktank has said. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said it had shaved more than a percentage point off its forecast for world output and raised its inflation estimate by 2.5 percentage points as a result of the Russian invasion. The OECD had previously expected world output to rise by 4.5% this year – but said the war in eastern Europe would have “numerous significant economic implications”. In its first comprehensive analysis of the crisis, the thinktank noted that while Russia and Ukraine contributed relatively small amounts to global output, they were big producers and exporters of key food items, minerals and energy. “The war has already resulted in sizeable economic and financial shocks, particularly in commodity markets, with the prices of oil, gas and wheat soaring.” The OECD – which has 38 developed country members – said the eurozone would be especially hard hit by the economic fallout from the conflict, with growth 1.4 points lower than expected at just under 3%. With the war raising the cost of energy and food, the thinktank said it was also sharply raising its 2022 inflation forecast to around 7.5%. The OECD had already raised its cost of living projections by around 0.5 points to 5% since its last half-yearly economic outlook was published in December 2021. “In the near term, many governments will need to cushion the blow of higher energy prices, diversify energy sources and increase efficiency wherever possible”, the OECD said. “The war has underlined the importance of minimising dependence on Russia for key energy imports.” Laurence Boone, the OECD’s chief economist said Europe faced an acute refugee crisis, adding that burden-sharing was needed to take the pressure off those countries – Poland and Moldova – taking large numbers of people fleeing the conflict. “The war is having an impact on the rest of the world through two main economic channels: higher food prices, which will hurt low income and emerging markets especially, and energy prices, which will affect businesses and consumers world wide,” Boone said. Ukraine is a major exporter of food, and the OECD warned the loss of the country’s entire crop this year would cut supplies of wheat by 12%, maize by almost 10% and other cereals by 8%. The OECD’s estimates are based on the assumption that the commodity and financial market shocks seen in the first two weeks of the conflict last for at least a year, and include a deep recession in Russia, with output declining by more than 10% and inflation rising by close to 15 percentage points. “The war in Ukraine has created a new negative supply shock for the world economy, just when some of the supply-chain challenges seen since the beginning of the pandemic appeared to be starting to fade,” the OECD report said.",News/Business,OECD says Ukraine war means governments must help households with rising bills,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/oecd-says-ukraine-war-means-governments-must-help-households-with-rising-bills
3/17/2022,"Iwas in Vancouver, in the final days of shooting an American television show, when news of the virus started filtering through. Vancouver is a busy place for film production; the downtown area plays host to a number of film crews on any given day of the week but, this particular afternoon, word began to spread that productions were shutting down left and right, sending everybody home. Then, filming on the production I was working on was also cancelled; the show would not “go on”. Everything stopped. I was still able to fly to Barbados, to film a documentary on the origins of my name Harewood, and its links to the slave trade and Harewood House in West Yorkshire. Though I had been to the island many times before, this was a unique and unsettling trip. I spent my time uncovering uncomfortable truths relating to the treatment of my people – but it wasn’t the first time I had found myself confronted by difficult and painful facts. A couple of years ago, I took part in one of a series of films about mental health, in which I investigated my own psychotic breakdown at the age of 23. I had forgotten most of what happened, but the documentary brought back the disturbing thoughts and feelings I had experienced all those years ago. It really rather frightened me, and I had gladly scuttled off to Vancouver once filming had ended to forget the emotions it had stirred up. But this time, after my trip to Barbados, I found myself returning to the UK mid-lockdown, walking through a deserted Heathrow airport, heading to a house I had bought five years earlier and barely lived in. Four months into the pandemic, I realised it was the longest period I had spent sleeping in my own bed in nine years. Alone with my thoughts, I had time to consider my life in a way I hadn’t before. I think a lot of people found themselves in a similar position and quite a few struggled with what they found. Relationships foundered, marriages ended and stress levels went through the roof as people discovered the difficulties of being cooped up with their families. When George Floyd was murdered by a US policeman in May 2020, it set in motion a huge conversation around race and inequality that reverberated around the world. And yet I had the feeling that, in England, there were voices proclaiming racism to be an American problem, something that didn’t really exist here, as the Sewell report had concluded months earlier. And in that moment, I grabbed my computer and started furiously writing, jotting down my life story in a brutally honest fashion. I took all the uncomfortable truths I had learned early on in the pandemic and placed them into form and chapter. Five months and 80,000 words later, I had my first book, aptly titled Maybe I Don’t Belong Here. The past two years have given me time to take a deep look at my life and I’ve found that being honest about my vulnerabilities has allowed others to openly talk about their insecurities, too – and, in doing so, find new strength. We now live in the strangest of times: people will tell you that up is down and that criminal, foolish, buffoons are actually political geniuses rather than dangerous, self-obsessed charlatans. I look around and wonder, am I part of the same reality? Those of us who have spent the past couple of years figuring ourselves out now sit and watch the world around us unravel. All we can do is keep shedding a little more light, in the hope that it’s enough to keep the darkness at bay. David Harewood is an actor and writer.

3/17/2022,"Senior leaders of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the US-based non-profit organization known for combatting antisemitism and tracking extremism, debated whether to end a controversial program that connects American law enforcement officers with police leaders and members of the military in Israel, a 2020 internal document reveals. The ADL, which works closely with US police on trainings related to bias and hate crimes, has for years run a program that sends delegations from US law enforcement departments to Israel to “study first-hand Israel’s tactics and strategies to combat terrorism”. The trips have long faced criticism from US civil rights groups, who argue that the trainings could encourage US police to further militarize their forces and exacerbate police violence. A draft memo obtained by the Guardian and Jewish Currents shows that amid the George Floyd protests in 2020, two ADL executives questioned whether the trips could make American officers “more likely to use force” and contribute to the “problem” of police brutality. They considered advocating for the termination of the program. “In light of the very real police brutality at the hands of militarized police forces in the US, we must ask ourselves difficult questions, like whether we are contributing to the problem,” wrote George Selim, an ADL senior vice-president, and Greg Ehrie, VP for law enforcement and analysis, on 9 June in the draft memo. “We must ask ourselves why it is necessary for American police, enforcing American laws, would need to [sic] meet with members of the Israeli military. We must ask ourselves if, upon returning home, those we train are more likely to use force. We hope that that is not accurate.” Since 2004, the ADL has taken 500 to 600 police officers and partners to Israel for “educational and training purposes”, the document said. The VPs said the trips had “built bonds” among police but were “of questionable programmatic value”. They said the program could lead to “lost donor revenue” and could cost the ADL upward of $200,000 per year in staff time, including resources to “defend the trips from controversy”. The draft memo further said it was unclear whether the trainings helped encourage police combat antisemitism. The draft document said termination of the program was the “best approach” since it would “eliminate a program with limited impact and high controversy”. Asked about the document this week, Selim said the memo was an “early draft” written before the ADL had made a final assessment. Selim said he and Ehrie had conducted a “thorough assessment of the program” after writing the draft memo, and that their final recommendation was “to continue the program with updated curriculum and content in order to increase the value and impact of this type of law enforcement engagement”. The draft was addressed to the ADL CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, but Selim declined to say whether the CEO had received it or how widely it was circulated. Selim added that the trips were “paused” due to the pandemic but suggested they could restart: “We remain committed to law enforcement engagement and professional development nationally and internationally and are likely to expand our educational law enforcement programs.” George Floyd’s murder had prompted the ADL to “ask ourselves tough and probing questions”, Selim said, adding that his review had concluded that the criticisms of the exchange were false: “ADL is proud of its decades of work with law enforcement and believes strongly that those relationships are crucial in helping protect all people from hate crimes and hate-motivated violence. As we said in the memo, the Law Enforcement Leadership Seminars have led to stronger relationships with law enforcement that have directly helped ADL with the investigation of hate crimes and protecting local communities.” Selim also said the trips were “educational and cultural in nature” – featuring briefings, site visits and meetings with Israeli and Palestinian law enforcement leaders – and that they did not involve “tactical trainings” or teachings about interrogation methods. Activists have protested against the ADL’s Israel trips through a campaign called Deadly Exchange. In 2020, a coalition of activist groups – including the Movement for Black Lives, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Arab Resource and Organizing Center – also launched a “Drop the ADL” campaign, citing its ties to law enforcement. The ADL, which works closely with US police on trainings related to bias and hate crimes, has repeatedly dismissed the protests, arguing the activists misrepresent the program. . Bill Ayub, the Ventura county sheriff in California, who went to Israel for an ADL training in 2017, said he had been impressed by the “Hollywood-esque” surveillance systems of Israeli law enforcement, which he said were more invasive than those used by US law enforcement but “allowed them to have a really good handle on problems brewing and to track known dissidents or known criminals”. “The Israelis are very innovative, out of necessity, with technology and measures for providing security and detecting threatening behavior and criminal behavior,” he said. Ayub also said he had been shocked to learn how Israeli officers used force during arrests: “We’d be in jail if we did something like that here,” he said. Stefanie Fox, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, an organization that advocates for Palestinian rights, said that the memo showed how public pressure had forced the ADL to “finally admit the contradiction between their long support for law enforcement and their public claim of working for civil rights”, but that she was disappointed the organization seemed to be doubling down on the program: “This should be a dividing line for progressives.”",News/US news,"ADL leaders debated ending police delegations to Israel, memo reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/adl-police-delegations-israel
3/17/2022,"Disney staff members this week and next are staging walkouts over Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill. The Parental Rights in Education bill, which critics have dubbed as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, was recently passed by Florida Republicans but has not yet been signed into law. The controversial bill bans all discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools. Disney and its CEO, Bob Chapek, spoke out against the bill last week in an internal staff email but refused to publicly condemn the bill, prompting the staged walkouts from employees. Chapek said Disney’s leadership “unequivocally stand” with LGBTQ+ employees but said that corporate statements “do very little to change outcomes or minds”, adding that “they are often weaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame”. Chapek’s statement sparked backlash within the company, which employs more than 75,000 staff members in Florida. Many condemned Chapek’s silence, to which he responded: “Speaking to you, reading your messages, and meeting with you have helped me better understand how painful our silence was. “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,” he said, adding that Disney will be “pausing all political donations in the state of Florida”. Since then, Disney employees have been organizing 15-minute daily walkouts and “sickouts”, according to the Twitter page @DisneyWalkout launched in response to the bill. Staff members will stage a full-day walkout on 22 March. In an open letter on the accompanying website, WhereIsChapek.com, Disney employees criticized Disney’s leadership, saying: “As a community, we have been forced into an impossible and unsustainable position. We must now take action to convince TWDC to protect employees and their families in the face of such open and unapologetic bigotry.” On Wednesday, Marvel Studios, which is owned by Disney, denounced the bill and said that it “proudly” stands with the community and pledged to continue its support and allyship. The bill requires the implementation of “procedures to reinforce fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding upbringing and control of their children”. In addition to allowing parents to launch legal actions against school boards if they believe policies overstep that “fundamental right”, the bill bans teachers from discussing in classrooms LGBTQ+ topics “not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students”.",News/US news,Disney staff stage walkouts over Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/disney-walkouts-florida-dont-say-gay-bill
3/17/2022,"Campaigners pushing for the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe were told by the Foreign Office not to make a “song and dance” about her plight, according to an MP. Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, whose Hampstead and Kilburn constituency was where Zaghari-Ratcliffe lived before she was detained in Iran, said the decision by Nazanin’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, to be “so public and vocal” had been the right strategy. After six years of detention, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her family at RAF Brize Norton in the early hours of Thursday morning. Siddiq revealed on Thursday: “The Foreign Office told us many times: ‘We could have got Nazanin out earlier if you didn’t make such a song and dance about this,’ but Richard disagreed with that.” Siddiq said Ratcliffe’s approach has been vindicated. “Throughout the course of the six years now I feel that probably was the right strategy because I think the government did respond to the public pressure and I think they do respond to media pressure in particular,” she said. “I think we probably did put pressure on especially the current prime minister by being so public and vocal and campaigning.” She also said Foreign Office officials had been opposed to disclosing this week that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had had her UK passport returned to her by Iran. “When I tweeted she got her British passport, the Foreign Office were very nervous about it,’ Siddiq said. “Richard doesn’t have Twitter. He asked me to tweet it, because he thinks we need to be transparent about everything. And he thinks that even if the deal had fallen through at the last moment, at least people would have known how close we got.” Though the efforts of the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, were hailed for the breakthrough in complicated diplomatic talks with the Iranian government, concerns have been raised about the £400m sum paid by Britain that helped secure it. James Cleverly, the UK minister for Europe and North America, called Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s return a “really uplifting” moment, and promised that the government had “taken every precaution to make sure” a separate £400m debt repayment made to Iran would be spent solely on humanitarian aid. Cleverly said it was a historic debt that was treated separately – but that sanctions and international laws against funding terrorism and money laundering meant it had been complex to arrange. “I can’t go into the details because of confidentiality agreements, but we have ensured that the money is for exclusively humanitarian purposes and that it abides by those international sanctions,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Cleverly refused to say if the US had agreed to the terms of the deal, following reports that the White House last summer effectively blocked the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and another British-Iranian citizen, Anoosheh Ashoori, because of disagreement about a third detainee. Morad Tahbaz, who is a joint Iranian, UK and US citizen, was also this week released from prison but remains confined to the country. “We will continue to work to not just keep him out on furlough, but get him released – and obviously we’ll continue working closely with the Americans and everything to do with Iran,” said Cleverly. After Boris Johnson was accused of cosying up to Middle Eastern dictators to push for them to increase oil supplies to help settle energy prices, Cleverly defended the prime minister’s trip to Saudi Arabia. During the visit, the kingdom executed three men, just days after the largest state-sponsored killing in its history when 81 were subjected to capital punishment. Cleverly said it was “ridiculous and distasteful” for any comparisons to be drawn with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, who has clamped down on political protest in his own country after the invasion of Ukraine.",News/News,"Foreign Office urged Richard Ratcliffe not to make ‘song and dance’, says MP",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/foreign-office-urged-richard-ratcliffe-not-to-make-song-and-dance-says-mp
3/17/2022,"Kanye West has been suspended from Instagram for 24 hours, after he used a racial slur to describe TV presenter Trevor Noah. A spokesperson for Instagram’s parent company Meta told TMZ and HuffPost that the suspension was due to West violating the company’s policy on hate speech, bullying and harassment. Noah had criticised West while presenting The Daily Show, saying of West’s numerous recent posts about ex-wife Kim Kardashian: “What she’s going through is terrifying to watch … What we’re seeing is one of the most powerful, one of the richest women in the world, unable to get her ex to stop texting her, to stop chasing after her, to stop harassing her.” West responded by rewriting the lyrics of Kumbaya to “koon baya my lord”, a twist on a word used by some to describe a Black person who rejects or undermines their own ethnicity. Noah responded to the post, saying: You’re an indelible part of my life Ye. Which is why it breaks my heart to see you like this. I don’t care if you support Trump and I don’t care if you roast Pete. I do however care when I see you on a path that’s dangerously close to peril and pain … Don’t ever forget, the biggest trick racists ever played on black people was teaching us to strip each other of our blackness whenever we disagree. Tricking us into dividing ourselves up into splinters so that we would never unite into a powerful rod. Kardashian filed for divorce in January 2021, and she was declared legally single by a US court earlier this month. West has lamented the split on his 2021 album Donda and in a recent poem, Divorce. He has also repeatedly taunted Kardashian’s boyfriend, comedian and actor Pete Davidson, including in a music video where a claymation figure decapitated a model of Davidson. After criticism of the video, West defended it as creative expression, saying: “Art is not a proxy for any ill or harm.” West also posted screenshots from a conversation with Kardashian in which she said he was “creating a dangerous and scary environment” and worried: “Someone will hurt Pete and this will all be your fault.”. West later apologised for posting the screenshots and accompanying messages, saying: “I know sharing screen shots was jarring and came off as harassing Kim. I take accountability,” but he has since continued with public criticism of Kardashian and Davidson. After West criticised her parenting, Kardashian wrote in February: “Divorce is difficult enough on our children and Kanye’s obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all. From the beginning, I have wanted nothing but a healthy and supportive co-parenting relationship because it is what is best for our children and it saddens me that Kanye continues to make it impossible every step of the way.”",Arts/Music,Kanye West suspended from Instagram after slur against Trevor Noah,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/17/kanye-west-suspended-from-instagram-after-slur-against-trevor-noah
3/17/2022,"Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” on Wednesday for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine, where hospitals and maternity wards have been bombed. But declaring someone a war criminal is not as simple as just saying the words. There are set definitions and processes for determining who is a war criminal and how they should be punished. Here’s a look at how this all works: The term applies to anyone who violates a set of rules adopted by world leaders known as the law of armed conflict. The rules govern how countries behave in times of war. Those rules have been modified and expanded over the past century, drawn from the Geneva conventions in the aftermath of the second world war and protocols added later. The rules aim to protect people not taking part in fighting and those who can no longer fight, including civilians such as doctors and nurses, wounded troops and prisoners of war. Treaties and protocols lay out who can be targeted and with what weapons. Certain weapons are prohibited, including chemical or biological agents. The “grave breaches” of the conventions that amount to war crimes include wilful killing and extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity. Other war crimes include deliberately targeting civilians, using disproportionate force, using human shields and taking hostages. The international criminal court (ICC) also prosecutes crimes against humanity committed in the context of “a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population”. These include murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, rape and sexual slavery. The most likely way that Putin could come to be defined as a war criminal is through the widely recognised legal doctrine of command responsibility. If commanders order or know or are in a position to know about crimes and did nothing to prevent them, they can be held legally responsible. Generally, there are four paths to investigate and determine war crimes, though each one has limits. One is through the ICC. A second option would be if the UN turns its work on the inquiry commission over to a hybrid international war crimes tribunal to prosecute Putin. A third would be to create a tribunal or court to try Putin by a group of interested or concerned states and groups, such as Nato, the EU and the US. The military tribunals at Nuremberg against Nazi leaders are an example. Finally, some countries have their own laws for prosecuting war crimes. Germany, for example, is already investigating Putin. The US does not have such a law, but the justice department has a section that focuses on acts including international genocide, torture, recruitment of child soldiers and female genital mutilation. It is not clear. Russia does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC and would not send any suspects to the court’s headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands. The US does not recognise the authority of the court either. Putin could be tried in a country chosen by the UN or by a consortium of concerned countries. But getting him there would be difficult. Yes. From the tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo to more recent ad hoc hearings, senior leaders have been prosecuted for their actions in countries including Bosnia, Cambodia and Rwanda. The former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milošević was put on trial by a UN tribunal in The Hague for fomenting bloody conflicts as Yugoslavia crumbled in the early 1990s. He died in his cell before the court could reach a verdict. His Bosnian Serb ally Radovan Karadžić and the Bosnian Serb military leader, Gen Ratko Mladić, were successfully prosecuted and are serving life sentences. The former Liberian president Charles Taylor was sentenced to 50 years after being convicted of sponsoring atrocities in neighbouring Sierra Leone. Chad’s former dictator Hissène Habré, who died last year, was the first former head of state to be convicted of crimes against humanity by an African court. He was sentenced to life.",News/World news,"Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal, and who decides?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/vladimir-putin-war-criminal-ukraine-russia-president-justice
3/17/2022,"Ocado said sales dropped in its first quarter as shoppers returned to pre-Covid buying habits, and warned it was difficult to predict what the impact on business would be of rising food prices coupled with the cost of living crisis. The online supermarket, which said it was implementing cost cuts to protect profits, said revenues fell 5.7% to £564.7m year-on-year in the 13 weeks to 27 February as an increase in its number of customers and transactions was offset by a steep fall in the amount being spent online. The average amount spent by a shopper fell 15% year-on-year in the first quarter, to £124, as more customers returned to shopping in physical stores as the UK moved out of pandemic conditions and restrictions. This fall more than offset a 31% increase in active customers to 835,000 and the average number of orders a week rising 11.6% year-on-year to 367,500. Ocado said that, like the rest of the industry, it is being hit by significant rises in costs across the board – the 4.3% rise in food prices in February marks the fastest rate of increase since 2013 – from raw materials, energy and utilities to the dry ice used to keep food frozen and fresh during transport. The company, a joint venture with Marks & Spencer, said that overall the UK grocery market had seen sales fall by 4%, with demand affected by consumers having to cope with steep rises in the cost of living. “The scale of food price inflation over the course of this year, coupled with the overall level of market demand as the cost of living increases, particularly rising energy costs, is difficult to predict,” the company said. “We intend to continue to offer the best possible value to customers while recognising the overall level of pricing in the market.” The company dampened its outlook, saying that while revenue growth for the year should end in “the high teens”, it is likely to be about 10% overall in 2022 due to factors including the war in Ukraine’s impact on inflation, the lower level of market demand, and the “continued return to pre-Covid shopping patterns”.

3/17/2022,"Liam Manning is recalling the days when he would coach five nights a week at Ipswich’s academy, take another session on a Saturday morning, turn out for Leiston in the Eastern Counties League in the afternoon and arrive at Ipswich’s training ground at seven the next morning to drive the minibus to a youth game anywhere across East Anglia or London. “You’d take any players that needed a lift, the equipment – we were the kit men as well – and there will be coaches all around the country that can relate to that,” he says of a time when he worked with under-nines to under-15s. “I remember having a kickabout on the M25 once. It was gridlocked, the road was closed and no one was moving anywhere. I remember doing a few keepie-uppies because we had been sat there for a few hours. They were good times.” By his own admission, Manning, whose MK Dons are third in League One, has had an unconventional journey into coaching. After being released by Ipswich, he dropped into non-league, playing semi-pro in Suffolk either side of a season in Iceland with Selfoss, and started coaching at 21 to supplement his income. “I wasn’t the best player. I was honest, hard-working … it’s my nice way of saying I used to keep it simple and smash into people,” he says, laughing. But those roots provide Manning with a sense of perspective. “You don’t need all the bells and whistles. Ultimately, it comes down to having really good people and a good culture where people are passionate about what they do.” It is 4pm and Manning has just come out of a monthly board meeting with the sporting director, Liam Sweeting, whose savvy recruitment has helped shape a team challenging for promotion. The forward Scott Twine, who cost £300,000, and the centre-back Harry Darling have been among this season’s standout players and another, Matt O’Riley, joined Celtic in January, when they also had to absorb four of their five loanees being recalled. At 29, Josh McEachran is something of a veteran in a youthful squad – MK Dons have on average the division’s second-youngest starting XI – but Dean Lewington, son of Ray, the assistant to Roy Hodgson who helped take training before the first league game after Russell Martin left for Swansea, is a true outlier: he turns 38 in May. “He kills our average age a little bit,” Manning says, grinning. The wing-back Kaine Kesler Hayden arrived on loan from Aston Villa, the goalkeeper Jamie Cumming from Chelsea and the midfielder Matt Smith on a permanent deal from Manchester City. MK Dons also signed Dan Kemp and Conor Coventry, both of whom Manning worked with at West Ham, where Declan Rice was a first-year scholar and centre-back when Manning was appointed Under-23s head coach in 2015. “Every time you watched a youth-team game it looked too easy for him – not because he did anything outrageous but because he was so clean with the basics, the little things on transition. When he is cleaning up, rather than smashing it out of play or panicking, he would just find a pass or start an attack.” MK Dons had done their homework on Manning and unlike with his predecessors, Martin, Roberto Di Matteo and Karl Robinson, they wanted someone with experience of leading a senior team. Manning’s credentials stood out given the swift upturn he oversaw at the Belgian second-tier side Lommel SK, bought by the City Football Group, which owns Manchester City, in May 2020 when the club were on the brink of bankruptcy. On arrival in Lommel, Manning was the only Englishman and had six registered players. Data such as passes per minute – a scatter graph showed they were in the leading teams for possession in Europe – suggested he could prove the perfect match for MK Dons. Before Lommel, he spent 14 months with another club in the CFG stable: as New York City’s director of coaching. “I planned on being there a little bit longer but in this industry you cannot map it all out in a nice chronological order, can you? Sometimes I think, and I found it when I went from Ipswich to West Ham, that you can become slightly cocooned. We do it in England where you see it a certain way [because of] the regard English football is held in, the intensity and the volume of games … but if you step in and experience it in a different country you learn a lot, in terms of how people operate differently and, for example, how does the culture where you grow up affect how you communicate?” At New York, there were 42 nationalities across players and staff. Manning had just started Spanish lessons before moving to Belgium, where he tried and failed to master Dutch. “We spend so much time on the players and the team we neglect ourselves too often. I’m extremely guilty of that. We’ve spoken as staff about trying to bring someone in next season to do an hour a week of Spanish lessons.” At 23, Manning never envisaged advancing past the Uefa B licence because he found it so tough but last year completed his pro licence. “I remember the first few sessions,” he says, rowing back to starting his badges. “You’ve got people who know what they’re doing and talking about coming to watch your session. You’re thinking: ‘Crap, what’s he thinking of this?’ The process then was very much: ‘Pass/fail, clipboard, have you ticked everything off?’ It was like your driving test, rather than a bespoke plan to support you.” When Manning was living in New Jersey, a 45-minute train from New York City, he missed the Football League and games where promotion, relegation and sometimes more were at stake. MK Dons, who travel to Cambridge on Saturday, have lost once in the league since Christmas but Manning is staying grounded. His team are three points off second-placed Wigan, who have two games in hand. “I’m a proper negative nelly about it. I find it really difficult to enjoy a win, for example. It sounds mad because you do, but ‘bang’ and you’re straight into the next game. ‘What team am I going to pick? Who I am disappointing?’ “There is not a huge amount of time to reflect and enjoy those moments.” He could feel different at the end of May. “Until then, I’ll stay my boring, flat-line self,” he saying with a smile.",Sport/Football,MK Dons’ Liam Manning: ‘I remember having a kickabout on the M25 once’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2022/mar/17/mk-dons-liam-manning-manager-league-one
3/17/2022,"The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has laughed off questions in parliament about the trustworthiness of a minister who was told which way to vote in a cabinet meeting by a union leader. The transport minister, Mark Bailey, described the incident as a “rookie error” made several years ago for which he had “sincerely and fully apologised” and been cleared of by a standing royal commission. Emailed voting instructions from the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) secretary, Peter Simpson, to the then-energy minister in 2015 were part of a report published by a parliamentary committee on Wednesday night. The previously confidential report to the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) by Mike Summerell, a former state archivist, documents the conversation between Bailey and Simpson, for which Bailey used a private email account. The CCC found no evidence of corrupt conduct in Bailey’s emails with the ETU, but said his use of private email for ministerial purposes was in breach of the ministerial code. In the correspondence, Simpson told the minister that cabinet members will vote on three options to reform workers compensation laws, but added that “option A” is the only “acceptable” choice. “An important one mate, we obviously hope you go for A,” Simpson said. Bailey replied: “Will give you a call in the morning comrade, M.” Summerell said in his report that of the 1200 emails he analysed, those with the ETU were “very different in nature and tone” from all the others. He said Bailey seemed to have “difficulty managing” his relationship with the union, which could be in breach of the ministerial code of conduct. “Unfortunately the interests of the ETU significantly interact with key elements of the minister’s portfolio and his role as a shareholding minister in a number of government owned corporations,” Summerell said in the report. “These records and the relationship in general are potentially matters that should be considered by the CCC or the integrity commissioner in terms of potential breach.” Palaszczuk shrugged off questions about Bailey’s trustworthiness in parliament on Thursday. “Queenslanders can trust every member of this government,” she said. “I’ll tell you who Queenslanders don’t trust – that guy,” she said, pointing at the Liberal National party leader, David Crisafulli. In another 2015 email examined in Summerell’s report, Noel Morris, a Rail, Tram and Bus Union member, sent Bailey a “hitlist” of at least 13 public servants allegedly aligned with the Liberal National party. Morris had warned the minister they could use budget estimates to apply a “blow torch” and “destabilise the Labor government”. “This is a real risk from the LNP bureaucrats and backers in the senior ranks of the departments,” Morris said. Bailey replied saying a person on the list was “def not LNP”. In parliament on Thursday Palaszczuk denied knowing about the hitlist, triggering howls from the LNP benches. “If you table the email, I’m happy to have a look at it, I’m happy to look into the matter,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Palaszczuk and Bailey said the minister’s use of private emails for government business had been dealt with in 2017, and he had been cleared of wrongdoing by the CCC. On Thursday afternoon, Bailey said it was “not exactly unusual” for a union to support a Labor candidate running for office. “Unions and the Labor party have had a relationship for 130 years, that’s not a surprise to anybody,” he said. But despite that relationship, Bailey said ministers made their own assessments and came to their own conclusions. “Politicians and ministers get lobbied by stakeholders, peak bodies, all kinds of people, all the time,” he said. “That’s a normal part of the political process.”",News/Australia news,Annastacia Palaszczuk laughs off questions in parliament about minister instructed by union,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/annastacia-palaszczuk-laughs-off-questions-in-parliament-about-minister-instructed-by-union
3/17/2022,"In 2015, the first season of Occupied was broadcast on Norwegian television. The series depicts a Russian occupation of Norway, something that is tacitly accepted by the EU and the United States as a way to restart oil production facilities that had been shut down by the green Norwegian government. My aim for the show was to focus on the moral dilemmas faced by ordinary people in an extreme situation – to parallel what our parents and grandparents experienced during the German occupation of Norway between 1940 and 1945. The manoeuvring between a smaller country, a powerful neighbour and the rest of the world’s ruling nations, balancing political principles against economic considerations and their own security, was the backdrop. I thought it would be obvious that the point of the fictional world in Occupied was not to say anything about Russia – just as Steven Spielberg’s aim in Jaws was not to say anything about great white sharks. However, the Russian authorities did not take it very well. Vyacheslav Pavlovsky, the ambassador to Norway, told the Russian news agency Tass that “it is certainly regrettable that in this year, when the 70th anniversary of the victory in the second world war is being celebrated, the authors have seemingly forgotten about the heroic contribution of the Soviet army in the liberation of northern Norway from the Nazi occupiers, and decided, in the worst cold war tradition, to frighten Norwegian viewers with a nonexistent threat from the east”. It may be that the ambassador was a little touchy, because Russia had annexed Crimea the year before. But Occupied had been written and put into production long before that and it was a work of fiction in which, for once, the Russians weren’t depicted as a group of robotic, uniformly evil “bad guys”. So why the fury? Perhaps the answer is that in an era in which the truth has been devalued by fake news, in which leaders are elected on a wave of emotion rather than their merits or political viewpoints, facts no longer carry the weight they once did. In writing about Russia’s latest war in Ukraine, a frequently used quotation comes from the US senator Hiram Johnson, who said in 1917 that “the first casualty, when war comes, is truth”. It is used, among other things, to remind journalists of just how vulnerable the truth is when two sides are fighting for the dominance of their own version of events. In 1937, when the fascist General Franco bombed the town of Guernica, massacring the civilian population, many could testify to what happened. As soon as images of the destruction and the victims began to emerge, Franco and his generals realised the emotions they would stir both in Spain and abroad, and claimed that the Republican inhabitants had destroyed their own town. For a time, this version of events was believed – at least by those who wanted to believe it. But the Republicans had a better storyteller on their side. Pablo Picasso responded with one of his most famous paintings, Guernica, which depicted the inferno in the small Basque town. That work, painted by someone who lived in Paris and the product of an artist’s imagination and experience, opened Europe’s eyes. If Guernica was both propaganda and a masterpiece, the same can be said of Sergei Eisenstein’s film Battleship Potemkin, commissioned by the Soviet authorities to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 revolution. Though both works purport to depict real events, they also make use of significant artistic licence – the famous massacre scene on the steps in Odesa never actually took place, for example. But the narrator of fiction does not need to worry about such details; the aim is to say something true, not necessarily something factual. To move hearts and minds, not report on the who, what, where and when. This freedom is what gives fiction its power, particularly when we as an audience are unaware that we are being propagandised. Tanner Mirrlees, author of Hearts and Mines: The US Empire’s Culture Industry, describes the way the US Office of War Information created a division to work with Hollywood during the second world war, the Bureau of Motion Pictures. Between 1942 and 1945, the Bureau reviewed 1,652 scripts, revising or removing anything that depicted the US in an unfavourable way, including material that made Americans seem “oblivious to the war or anti-war”. Films were, and remain, the perfect vehicle for shaping popular opinion, Mirrlees said, because watching a film provides people with a galvanising, shared experience. Hollywood marketed American military ideals throughout the cold war, and it continues to do so even now. Today, the entire world is essentially sitting in the same movie theatre, watching events unfold in Ukraine. But what we are seeing – figuratively speaking – are dubbed versions, featuring subtitles in our own languages. There is a battle under way between different versions of the story, and the best one will prove triumphant. The question, therefore, is what measures we are prepared to take to win those hearts and minds, especially when Vladimir Putin is deploying the kind of censorship and propaganda we thought had been banished to the past. Is it desirable – or appropriate, even – to play by his rules? It seems contradictory that a democratic country would give up principles such as freedom of speech and transparency, even in an attempt to temporarily protect those freedoms. We might hope that the truth – the imperfect, subjective truth of a journalist, an artist or some other storyteller who is trying to express something true – will win. There are examples of this, after all, such as a Soviet Union that collapsed from within or a Donald Trump who was thrown out of the White House. Faced with an exhausting tangle of different versions of reality, we do not have to give in and accept that every version is equally true. Some really are more true than others. Putin’s narrative around why Russia has gone to war in Ukraine is gaining ground with a majority of Russians without access to social media or foreign reporting. But the younger generation in Russia uses virtual private networks and other technological loopholes to access different views on what is happening. Their numbers are still small, but they are a resourceful group who will, themselves, eventually become journalists, writers and artists, using stories as weapons. We follow the military developments, sanctions and diplomacy from day to day, but the war for the narrative is the long war. Ultimately, it is a war that Putin will lose. Franco ruled Spain for almost 40 years. But in the end he was defeated in the history books. Guernica was first shown in Spain in 1981, six years after Franco’s death. It was seen by more than one million people in the first 12 months alone, and is still one of the biggest draws at the Reina Sofia gallery in Madrid. Because the truest – if not the most factual – stories are the best. Jo Nesbø is a bestselling Norwegian novelist, screenwriter and musician.

3/17/2022,"Chinese property shares have soared for a second day thanks to a decision by Beijing’s leadership to throw the country’s struggling real estate sector a lifeline amid growing pressures at home and abroad. Despite a downgrade for China’s third-biggest property developer Sunac on Thursday, stocks in the sector lifted again in Hong Kong and the mainland thanks to an announcement by vice premier Liu He, China’s economic tsar, on Wednesday that the government needed to reduce risks in the industry. In a sign of the heightened concern inside China’s Communist party leadership about the property sector and the economy in general – best illustrated by the near-collapse of the giant developer Evergrande – Liu urged the roll-out of market-friendly policies to support the economy.That pushed up the Hang Seng mainland properties index 14.8% by midday in Hong Kong on Thursday, versus a 5.8% gain in the main Hang Seng index. The sub-index had already jumped 14.7% on Wednesday. Technology shares have also bounced back after being under pressure for months. The Hang Seng tech tracker rose more than 7% after a stunning 22% gain on Wednesday, though has still halved in value from its peaks last year. However, some investors are concerned that the property rally is not sustainable because it comes against a backdrop of continued problems for China’s biggest developers. Sunac China, the nation’s third-biggest property developer by sales, was downgraded to B- credit rating by the agency S&P on Thursday – making it harder to borrow money – because of concerns that it might not be able to meet its huge debt repayments of nearly $4bn due this year. Analysts at S&P have revised Sunac China’s liquidity position downwards from “less than adequate” to “weak”, and warned that the ratings will be reviewed as soon as “we have greater visibility on Sunac’s refinancing plans”. They wrote: “Sunac China Holdings Ltd is facing concentrated debt repayment over the next six to 12 months, resulting in considerable refinancing risk and weak liquidity. Capital market confidence is weakening rapidly.” Despite this gloomy assessment, Sunac’s shares were up 60% in Hong Kong on Thursday afternoon. Other major developer Country Garden and Evergrande were both more than 20% to the good. The real estate sector, a key driver of growth, has struggled for months as Beijing’s campaign to reduce high debt levels triggered a liquidity crisis among some major developers, resulting in bond defaults and shelved projects. After Liu’s comment, the banking and insurance regulator also said on Wednesday it would seek to stabilise land and home prices, transform the real estate sector and encourage mergers and acquisition loans for developers to purchase distressed assets.The finance ministry later said China was putting a planned property tax trial this year on ice, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Bill Bishop, the China observer and author of the Sinocism newsletter, said on Thursday that the move by Liu to try to shore up the markets showed how concerned Beijing had become. “The readout shows how worried policymakers have become about the markets, real estate and the economy but I would be cautious in assuming that the messaging from Liu He and other financial regulators means the tough days are over,” he wrote. “They are certainly trying to send a signal that they don’t want markets to go down more, but is it not clear this a real shift or more of a calibration to stabilize things.”",News/World news,"China property shares soar on Beijing stimulus, despite continued debt crisis ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/china-property-shares-soar-on-beijing-stimulus-despite-continued-debt-crisis
