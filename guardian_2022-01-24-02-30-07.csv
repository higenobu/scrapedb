1/24/2022,"If a British minister knowingly misleads parliament, they are expected to resign as a constitutional convention. Should a minister refuse, then they could legally carry on in office, but it would be unconstitutional. Boris Johnson seems not to care. Last week, he brazenly refused to accept that the political principle should apply to him. What are the consequences of lying to lawmakers? The answer could be nothing much. That highlights a far bigger problem. Britain is governed by a political – rather than a legal – constitution that relies heavily on conventions, and leaders with a sense of decency, to work. The dishonest and deceitful Mr Johnson is uniquely unsuited for the top job. A fish, it is said, rots from the head down. With claims of blackmail, bullying and racism, it seems so too does a political party.  The British constitution is said to be unwritten. This is only partly true. Written acts of parliament do regulate executive power. The European Communities Act 1972 took the UK into the EU and allowed judges to disapply legislation in conflict with European law. However, parliament remained ultimately sovereign in the sense that it did, under Mr Johnson, repeal the act in leaving the EU. The despot who deems themselves to be above the law was supposed to be done away with by a constitutional monarchy. But Mr Johnson shows the need to be protected from our elected representatives as much as our former royal rulers. In Britain this danger is heightened by the power of a Commons majority, what Lord Hailsham described in 1976 as an “elective dictatorship”. His answer was more democracy, not less. The peer’s proposals for a federal Britain and an elected second chamber have much to commend them today. The Human Rights Act, currently menaced by Mr Johnson’s proposals to hollow it out, fulfils Lord Hailsham’s call for a bill of rights. Ultimately, the former Tory lord chancellor believed only a written constitution could balance parliamentary power. Britain could muddle into a new constitution, undergirded by the rule of law. There would be no requirement for a separate constitutional court that could strike down primary legislation. But judges could act if the rule of law was threatened – as they did when Mr Johnson illegally attempted to prorogue parliament. Similarly, the courts would step in if a prime minister tried to legislate for a longer parliament than five years to hold on to power or rig elections by restricting the franchise. The rule of law could be entrenched such that only a supermajority in parliament could repeal it. Such a piecemeal approach might be how a new constitution emerges. The “partygate” scandal highlights that Mr Johnson won’t concede that the executive is subject to the law and equal to its citizens before it. The prime minister has little respect for the civil service, local government or parliament. He may, shamelessly, make a faux contrite apology this week in the wake of a report by the Cabinet Office’s Sue Gray into illegal Downing Street parties. As arbiter of the ministerial code, the prime minister decides his own fate. The betting is he won’t sack himself. There are few ways – bar a vote of no confidence – to get rid of a bad prime minister. There is no law against cabinet knavery. Maybe there should be. Mr Johnson once thought impeachment, last used in 1806, was a doomsday weapon against a prime minister. He tried to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war. Perhaps MPs should be able to hold a consequential Commons vote on the conduct of the prime minister, as one of Lord Hailsham’s Labour successors, Lord Falconer, suggests in a new book, for offending the constitutional principle of the rule of law. If such a test had existed, Mr Johnson would have failed it long ago – and the country would have been much better off.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on a bad prime minister: how to get rid of Boris Johnson | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/23/the-guardian-view-on-a-bad-prime-minister-how-to-get-rid-of-boris-johnson
1/24/2022,"Recovery from ill-health and injury is underrated. In the UK, and many other parts of the world, getting back to work as quickly as possible after sickness is what the neoliberal culture tells everyone to do (and workers indeed may have little choice in the matter in the world of the gig economy and zero-hours contracts). There is little societal value placed on convalescence – itself a tellingly old-fashioned word. Despite the efforts of the medical profession, there are occasions when patients, once their immediate problems have been patched up, feel themselves set loose to recover as best they can on their own. Most of us know how difficult this process can be – even the recovery from trivial complaints can be a trial, let alone that from serious disorders. Sometimes, indeed, a full recovery may not be possible, and the goal may be to regain a measure of dignity and autonomy while living with pain or disease. The large number of people suffering from long Covid is now forcing societies to try to understand, and have compassion for, recoveries that are especially long and fraught, with no clear outcomes.  Recovery is not only a physiological matter but, like disease and illness, is shaped by culture and ideas and expectations of the body, as Gavin Francis points out in his new book, Recovery: The Lost Art of Convalescence. It is also a matter for the mind. “We fall ill in ways that are profoundly influenced by our past experiences and expectations, and the same can be said of our paths to recovery,” adds Dr Francis, who works as a GP in Edinburgh. As a society, we are not, he argues, giving recuperation proper consideration: it is something that requires space and active attention to be fully effective. “I often remind patients that it’s worth giving adequate time, energy and respect to the process of healing,” he writes. As for individuals, so with the nation. England’s Covid-19 restrictions will be over at the end of March, and there is a faint glimmer of hope that the end of the acute phase of the pandemic could be in sight. But the UK’s recovery will take much, much longer. Even as the dangers of the Omicron variant are on the wane, the country is teetering on the brink of a cost-of-living crisis and is in the midst of others. And that is just the start. There can be no notion of the country simply snapping back to full health. There are psychological wounds – borne heavily by the very young and the very old – that run deep and will take time to heal, and indeed, may have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. There will be economic, cultural – and, yes, political – recoveries to attend to. The nation may one day be nursed back to health. This sort of long-term recovery will require not just hope and a prayer, but care and a communitarian spirit. “Give time, space and respect to convalescence if you can,” writes Dr Francis. “It’s an act that we need to engage in, giving of ourselves; a work of effort and endurance, and to a certain extent, of grace.”",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on recovery: an underrated process | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/23/the-guardian-view-on-recovery-an-underrated-process
1/24/2022,"Afghanistan can only be saved from state collapse and widespread starvation if the definition of legitimate humanitarian aid to the country is broadened, some of Britain’s most senior former security and diplomatic chiefs have said. The group, including two former national security advisers, a former chief of defence staff and a former ambassador to Afghanistan, write in a letter published in the Guardian that the aid that can be sent to the Taliban-controlled country without fear of sanctions is too restricted.  Afghanistan’s humanitarian situation has deteriorated drastically since last August when the Taliban stormed back to power 20 years after being toppled. International aid came to a sudden halt after their takeover, worsening the plight of millions of people who were already suffering from hunger after several severe droughts. Taliban leaders flew to Oslo on Saturday to participate in talks with Afghan civil society representatives and western powers on human rights and sanctions. The British former officials also call for an international conference to raise funds for the country and say Afghanistan is heading towards famine, not previously seen in 40 years of conflict. The group say a distinction needs to be drawn between money that can still be withheld to try to leverage political concessions from the Taliban, such as large-scale infrastructure projects, and money to enable government institutions to deliver basic human services and to keep the economy from collapsing. Aid exclusively channelled through the humanitarian system “cannot replace institutional service delivery to 40 million people”, the letter says. It adds: “Humanitarian agencies are ready and able to pay medical staff, teachers and other civil servants delivering public services. But they need the money to do so – far more than has yet been delivered. And they need a clear political mandate from donors, not least the US. Projects must be scrutinised and adjusted to ensure no direct benefit accrues to the Taliban.” The letters’ authors insist they are not seeking to give succour to the Taliban, but they warn economic collapse would cause widespread death and suffering and that this would not be in the interests of western security. A UN security council resolution passed on 23 December tried to give aid agencies greater leeway to deliver aid without fear of sanctions, but the resolution has not yet lifted the cloud of uncertainty preventing agencies and banks from sending aid to Afghanistan. The Norwegian government said the three days of talks it was hosting in Oslo did not amount to de facto recognition of the Taliban or a pullback from demands that the Taliban give Afghan women the right to work and be educated. “These meetings do not represent a legitimisation or recognition of the Taliban,” said the Norwegian foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt. “But we must talk to the de facto authorities in the country. We cannot allow the political situation to lead to an even worse humanitarian disaster. “In order to be able to help the civilian population in Afghanistan, it is essential that both the international community and Afghans from various parts of society engage in dialogue with the Taliban. We will be clear about our expectations of the Taliban, particularly as regards girls’ education and human rights, such as women’s right to participate in society.” The Taliban will meet officials from western powers and also exiled female Afghan leaders, journalists, and individuals working to safeguard human rights and address humanitarian, economic, social and political issues. “Every step taken toward the Taliban is a step taken against the people of Afghanistan,” Huitfeldt said, noting that the last time EU officials met the Taliban in Kabul, the houses of women who participated in protests were raided and activists were arrested. Nargis Nehan, an Afghan former minister for mines, petrol and industries who now lives in Norway, said she had declined an invitation to take part. She told Agence France-Presse she feared the talks would “normalise the Taliban and … strengthen them, while there is no way that they’ll change”. She asked: “What guarantee is there this time that they will keep their promises?”",News/World news,"Change to aid rules needed to prevent famine in Afghanistan, say UK experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/change-to-aid-rules-needed-to-prevent-famine-in-afghanistan-say-uk-experts
1/24/2022,"Fears are growing that action by the US central bank to combat high inflation will trigger a fresh debt crisis, as it emerged poor country repayments to creditors are already running at their highest level in two decades. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said developing country debt payments had more than doubled since 2010 and were likely to increase further if, as expected, the Federal Reserve pushed up interest rates.  Urging deeper debt relief, the JDC said payments to creditors already accounted for 14.3% of poor-country government revenue in 2021, up from 6.8% in 2010 and the highest level since 2001. Many poor countries have borrowed in US dollars, exposing them to the dual risk of higher borrowing costs and a weakening of their currencies against the greenback. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have called for more more comprehensive relief. Of the external debt payments by low and lower middle-income governments, 47% are to private lenders, 27% to multilateral institutions such as the Bank and the IMF, 12% to China and 14% to governments other than China. Heidi Chow, executive director of Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: “The debt crisis has already stripped countries of the resources needed to tackle the climate emergency and the continued disruption from Covid, while rising interest rates threaten to sink countries in even more debt.” The campaign group’s latest analysis found 54 countries were in debt crisis, defined as a situation where payments undermined the ability of a government to protect the basic economic and social rights of its citizens. Kenya and Malawi were among the countries which have been added to the list of countries in crisis, it added. “G20 leaders cannot keep burying their heads in the sand and wish the debt crisis away”, Chow said. “We urgently need a comprehensive debt cancellation scheme which compels private lenders to take part in debt relief.” The G20 created a new debt relief scheme at the end of 2020, called the Common Framework, which required countries to negotiate terms with bilateral sovereign creditors and the IMF, and then secure the same deal with private creditors. So far, none of the countries which have applied for the Common Framework have had any debt cancelled.",News/Business,Fears grow that US action on inflation will trigger debt crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/23/fears-grow-that-us-action-on-inflation-will-trigger-debt-crisis
1/24/2022,"Yes, protest can feel futile, but what other vehicles do we have to articulate our frustrations at those who lead us (I’ve been protesting all my life. It can feel futile, yet doing nothing is much worse, 21 January)? It takes effort to protest so it must be important to us. The targets of protest tend to be issues that are big, with long-term implications, and where the public know that short-term political decision-making will be wrong. Protests also keep issues in the media – which is vital.  Peter Riddle (Letters, 20 January) noted that the “partygate” pantomime steals the headlines and distracts from what is happening elsewhere in government. Earlier this month, the environment audit committee issued a damning report on the quality of our rivers and the performance of the Environment Agency, but it was lost in the brouhaha of partygate. Protection of our rivers is a significant, long-term issue, so at the weekend, I was at Port Meadow in Oxford, protesting against the lack of investment by Thames Water in wastewater treatment and the pathetic response by the Environment Agency to a quadrupling of raw sewage discharges in the upper Thames.Bill KingdomOxford  In mentioning the few protests that have prevented illiberal laws being passed in this country, Polly Toynbee forgets an important one, in which the Guardian itself played a role. On 3 January 2011, 3,000 people of the Forest of Dean marched in blizzard conditions to protest about the Tory government’s bill to sell off into private hands all of our publicly owned forests. The march, at which Jonathon Porritt, Lady Royall of Blaisdon and the bishop of Gloucester spoke passionately against the bill, and which featured the burning of a large effigy of the Houses of Parliament, was reported on in the Guardian. This was then taken up by all the other media, causing thousands of constituents – many of them Tory voters – to berate their MPs. Although the local Tory MP Mark Harper did his best to promote and defend the bill, popular opinion forced the then prime minister, David Cameron, into a U-turn and it was dropped. The group that organised that march, Hands off our Forest, still exists as a watchful eye on subsequent subtler attempts to carve up this valuable real estate for the government’s cronies and donors. Tragically, their right to protest in future could be severely curtailed by the proposed police and crime bill that the lords are doing their best to amend.John FrenchChepstow, Monmouthshire  Polly Toynbee is right that the so-called libertarians of the right are only interested in one freedom – to spend their money as they like – and they can’t be trusted to defend our communal and collective rights to freedom of expression and protest. Rights atrophy if they aren’t exercised and the right to protest protects us from politicians who see no further than parliamentary politics as the art of the possible. Street politics is the art of making things possible, from keeping our brave boys out of Vietnam to ridding us of the poll tax. They are among the freedoms that cement our social cohesion and community spirit, especially at crisis times like these. It is thus deeply dispiriting to hear absolutely nothing from the opposition on the appalling bill targeting the right to protest.Mary Pimm and Nik WoodLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/24/2022,"Your editorial on water pollution (18 January) is right to emphasise the need for a conversation about the water industry’s regulatory framework. Water companies recognise the urgent necessity of ending harm from overflows and improving the health of our rivers. Our recent 21st Century Rivers report calls on the government, regulators, water companies, agriculture and other sectors to work together to deliver a comprehensive national plan to bring about the transformation in our rivers that we all want to see. The radical improvement in England’s coastal bathing waters in recent decades, with 99% passing water quality tests and more than 70% classed as “excellent”, shows what can be achieved by working together.  Water companies have invested more than £160bn into an industry that was previously starved of cash and want to invest more. That’s why we’re working with the government and Ofwat to facilitate greater collaboration and investment to ensure we don’t waste this critical decade.Christine McGourtyChief executive, Water UK  The news that antimicrobial resistance is a leading cause of death worldwide is another warning sign about current, and future, health crises (Antimicrobial resistance now a leading cause of death worldwide, study finds, 20 January). Antimicrobial resistance is a silent killer of millions across the globe, but the double tragedy is that many people could be saved by the basics of clean water, sanitation and good hygiene, which are critical to prevent and control the spread of drug-resistant infections. Governments must take urgent action against this often-overlooked emergency and invest in the basics in the poorest countries – especially in healthcare centres – to stop the spread of preventable infections in the first place. Covid-19 and Ebola have been stark warnings.

There are solutions, and wouldn’t it be good if the UK used its leadership of the Global Ocean Alliance of 71 member countries to drive all governments and international criminal courts to recognise the dumping of fishing gear for economic gain as an environmental crime (ecocide); sanction exploiting nations and industries; and implement charges for the use of oceans beyond exclusive economic zones, as recommended in the 2021 Dasgupta review. The funding of pollution prevention, fishing net recovery programmes and ecosystem protection would introduce additional costs to the price of ocean products – but those are the real costs of exploitation.

1/24/2022,"US authorities are confident most states will soon reach and pass a peak in coronavirus Omicron variant cases, even as hospitals struggle to cope with the current surge, Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser said on Sunday.  “I think [we’re] as confident as you can be,” Anthony Fauci told ABC’s This Week. “You never want to be overconfident when you’re dealing with this virus, because it has certainly surprised us in the past. “But, if you look at the patterns that we have seen in South Africa, in the UK and in Israel, and in the [US] north-east and New England and upper midwest states, they have peaked and started to come down rather sharply. “There are still some southern states and western states that continue to go up but if the pattern follows the trend that we’re seeing in other places … I believe that you will start to see a turnaround throughout the entire country.” Fauci also predicted “a bit more pain and suffering with hospitalisations in those areas of the country that have not been fully vaccinated or have not gotten boosters”. But, he said, “we do know – and these are the recent data that have come out – that even with Omicron, boosting makes a major, major difference in protecting you from hospitalisation and severe outcomes. “So things are looking good. We don’t want to get overconfident. But they look like they’re going in the right direction right now.” More than 865,000 people have died in the US during the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci said Omicron “looks like” it is causing less severe disease than other variants, though “it’s by no means exempt from making people sick and putting them into the hospital, particularly those who are not vaccinated”. That relative lack of severity, he said, helped efforts to get Covid under control. “Control means you’re not eliminating it, you’re not eradicating it, but it gets down to such a low level that it’s essentially integrated into the general respiratory infections that we have learned to live with. “I mean, we would like them not to be present, but they’re there. But they don’t disrupt society. They don’t create a fear of severe outcomes that are broad. You will always get some severe outcomes with respiratory infections. Even in a good pre-Covid era, you have always had that. We’d like it to get down to that level where it doesn’t disrupt us, in the sense of getting back to a degree of normality. “That’s the best-case scenario. We have got to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but we have to be prepared, which is, I think, that we get yet again another variant that has characteristics that would be problematic, like a high degree of transmissibility or a high degree of virulence.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 75.5% of eligible Americans have received at least one vaccination dose and 63.3% are considered fully vaccinated. However, only 39.7% (or 53.2% of those eligible) have had booster shots. Further boosters could be recommended, Fauci said, once it is known how long a third shot of an mRNA vaccine or a second of the single-shot Johnson&Johnson vaccine will last. “Certainly you are going to see the antibody levels go down,” he said. “That’s natural, but … it is quite conceivable, and I hope it’s true, that the third-shot boost will give a much greater durability of protection. We’re following that very carefully. “And when I say protection, I mean protection against severe disease. You are going to see breakthrough infections as we’ve seen now, even in boosted people, but for the very most part, they’re mild or even asymptomatic.” Fauci also said supplies of Covid tests still had to be improved. The Omicron surge has coincided with problems which the Biden administration is attempting to solve, including by offering free at-home tests. Fauci was asked if it was safe to send children to school without a mask, in states where mandates are being removed, often due to political pressures. “We want to get the children back to school,” he said. “And the way you do that, you … surround the children with people who are vaccinated. For the children who are eligible to be vaccinated, get them vaccinated, and provide masks … as well as ventilation to make sure that you can get a respiratory infection at its lowest level of infectivity. “All of those things go together and masking is a part of that.”",News/US news,Fauci: US ‘confident’ Omicron will soon peak even as hospitals struggle,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/23/fauci-omicron-us-peak
1/24/2022,"Michael Gove has threatened a UK trading ban on manufacturers of combustible cladding and insulation unless they pay to fix dangerous housing. Opening a new front in the government’s attempt to force the construction industry to fix billions of pounds’ worth of fire safety defects, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities has given the companies a March deadline to agree a settlement.  In a letter to the industry, Gove highlighted more than £700m in profits made over the last four years by the three firms most closely associated with the Grenfell disaster – likely to mean Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan, which made the combustible cladding panels and insulation foam on Grenfell Tower, where a fire in June 2017 killed 72 people. He described as “extremely alarming” evidence revealed by the Grenfell Tower public inquiry about how firms manufactured, tested and marketed their combustible materials. Gove told the Construction Products Association in a letter: “The total contribution from the cladding and insulation sector must represent a significant portion of the total remediation costs, caused by the dangerous products sold by some of your members. “I am offering a window of opportunity, between now and March, for the sector to work with my department through open and transparent negotiations to agree a settlement that will restore confidence and secure an appropriate contribution from the sector.” If they failed to pay up, he said, he would consider “using our regulatory framework to limit any culpable company from operating and selling products in this country in the future”. He added: “I will pursue those individuals and firms liable for building defects who are unwilling to do the right thing now. There is no future for those companies and directors who are not fully committed to upholding the safety of residents and fixing past wrongs.” The inquiry has heard that a senior executive at Arconic, which made Grenfell’s combustible polyethylene-filled (PE) cladding panels, warned colleagues in 2016: “We really need to stop proposing PE in architecture! We are in the ‘know’.” When Kingspan, which made some of the combustible insulation, tested its foam insulation in 2007, the rig became “a raging inferno”. Celotex, which made most of the insulation, knew in 2013 that “in the event of a fire [its insulation] would burn”, the inquiry heard. The government has said removing dangerous cladding could cost more than £9bn. This month Gove promised in parliament that the government would give leaseholders statutory protection that extends to all works required to make buildings safe. Gove’s move came after he met housebuilders last week to demand they also pay up. He was met with a counter-demand that the government also target materials companies. Leaseholders affected by the cladding crisis welcomed the latest steps. UK Cladding Action Group, which represents thousands of people whose homes have been rendered worthless and are facing bills as high as £200,000 a household, said: “These firms have deep pockets and will fight tooth and nail to remain unaccountable for their failings. We support the minister as he works to protect innocent leaseholders from the failings of others.” Arconic declined to comment. It has previously said the principal cause of the Grenfell tragedy was “failure by those responsible for the refurbishment of the tower”. Kingspan and Celotex have been contacted for comment. Kingspan has previously said it “welcomes the plans for industry dialogue and the helpful clarity that should bring for all stakeholders”. Celotex has previously admitted to “unacceptable conduct on the part of a number of former employees”.",News/Business,Gove threatens trading ban on cladding firms unless they pay for repairs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/23/gove-threatens-trading-ban-on-cladding-firms-unless-they-pay-for-repairs
1/24/2022,"Millions of patients are currently on tenterhooks, often in agony, hoping the NHS will find time to treat them. In my local hospital trust alone, there are 100,000 people stuck in this limbo, with 8,000 of them waiting for more than a year to date. The backlog for operations has reached an all-time high, with Covid making an already difficult situation impossible. Those patients expecting surgery may be shocked by how the current system could encourage those who treat them to see pound signs rather than patients. During the pandemic, the government has poured funding into private healthcare firms, nominally to relieve pressure on overstretched NHS hospitals. The kind of spending that was once deployed for cataracts and hip operations is now being used routinely to deliver cancer and cardiology care.  Nobody objects to every effort being made to cut waiting lists: but that has not happened, and costs have also rocketed. During the Covid crisis, private companies have pocketed millions in furlough payments while billing the NHS for services that we now know weren’t fully used. This is not just a consequence of trying to respond to a virus; it may also be symptomatic of an inbuilt potential conflict of interest that has seeped into commissioning. Throughout the history of the health service, many NHS consultants have worn two hats, using private practice to top up their public salaries. As the NHS increasingly relies on capacity bought in from the private sector, many consultants have direct shares – and so a financial interest – in joint venture companies. Research by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest shows £36m of taxpayers’ money has been spent by London NHS trusts on cancer services alone with just one of these companies, HCA Healthcare. At the same time, 120 NHS doctors who work for these same trusts are engaged in joint ventures with HCA. Their accounts show that over the last six years, £249m in dividends have been generated as a result, of which £26m went to mainly NHS doctors. HCA is not the only company forming such joint ventures, with hundreds more consultants involved. Patients need to have confidence that if they are referred to a private provider, it is in their interests, not their consultant’s. So, too, that any delay does not reflect the cost of treatment. A constituent who was booked in for urgent NHS cancer surgery at a hospital run by a major healthcare firm just before Christmas had the surgery cancelled at the last minute. They were told that this was because the facilities were needed for private – and so likely more lucrative – patients. This incident, and the pressures behind it, should concern anyone who understands that the NHS will only thrive if it is medical urgency, and not money, that drives decisions. Ministers may argue that more than 300,000 people left waiting more than a year for surgery is a side-effect of the pandemic, but lists have been creeping up for years. Rather than invest in NHS capacity, recent years have seen a conscious decision to divert funding to profit-making private healthcare companies. Without more scrutiny, this could see healthcare outcomes shaped not by need but whether you have the money to jump the queue, with taxpayers and patients alike paying the price.

Many of his broadcast performances were of relatively obscure works, leading him to quip: “I think I’ve got the biggest repertoire of useless roles of anybody in the world!” The 38 BBC Proms appearances he made between 1959 and 1964 reflected this versatility. The first two came in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and Missa Solemnis, both under Malcolm Sargent (1959, 1960) and he returned to perform the Ninth Symphony on six further occasions. In the earlier years came works by Handel (Samson, Israel in Egypt) and Purcell. He took part in the Proms premieres of Mahler’s Eighth Symphony under Charles Groves (1964) and of Berlioz’s Béatrice et Bénédict under Colin Davis (1969). Other notable appearances were in Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde (three times), Janáček’s Glagolitic Mass, and in the title roles of Liszt’s oratorio Christus and Stravinsky’s Oedipus Rex.  His operatic debut came in 1959 with the Handel Opera Society, as Jupiter in that composer’s Semele, and he went on to sing Oedipus, Mozart’s Idomeneus, Smetana’s Dalibor and Svatopluk Cech (Janáček’s The Excursions of Mr Brouček). Initially he was much better known as a concert artist, and when he was invited to sing Tristan in the Welsh National Opera Tristan und Isolde under Reginald Goodall (1979), it was only his seventh major opera. Between 1978 and 1982 he sang several other key roles with WNO, including Florestan (Fidelio), Aegisthus (in Strauss’s Elektra), Peter Grimes, Manolios (Martinů’s The Greek Passion) and Filka Morozov (Janáček’s From the House of the Dead). In the last of these, according to the critic of Opera magazine, he fashioned an “impersonation of barely suppressed violence that frightened the audience as much as it did his fellow prisoners”. Probably the chief reason he did not do more operatic work lay in the perception that he lacked the requisite stage persona, his acting ability remaining largely undeveloped. He was born in Blackrod, Manchester. His father was a train builder for British Rail in nearby Horwich, his mother a confectioner. At the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern College of Music) he studied under Frederic Cox and Heddle Nash; later studies were with Boriska Gereb. In 1953, while still a student, he joined the BBC Northern Singers, becoming one of its founder members. He worked briefly for Barclays Bank, but could not leave soon enough to enter the world of music. The bank manager bore no grudge and indeed followed Mitchinson’s career with interest. When he invited him to give a recital for an internal Barclays function, Mitchinson opened the event with Roger Quilter’s Fair House of Joy, with its first line “Fain would I change that note”. One of Mitchinson’s first professional engagements was in a Chelsea Opera Group concert performance of Don Giovanni, and he also featured in Eric Robinson’s television series Music for You. He soon established himself on the concert circuit and eventually performed all over the world under such conductors as Giulini, Horenstein, Klemperer, Ozawa, Mehta and Masur. In Britain, radio listeners heard him in often relatively unfamiliar repertoire: Busoni’s Doktor Faust, Prokofiev’s Fiery Angel, Peter Cornelius’s Der Barbier von Bagdad, Strauss’s Friedenstag and two early operas by Wagner: Die Feen and Rienzi. The last of these, a landmark project masterminded and conducted by Edward Downes in 1976, presented the most complete form of the opera heard in modern times. The Tristan und Isolde for WNO three years later was another significant undertaking for Mitchinson and one of his greatest achievements. Mitchinson had worked with Goodall once before, in 1969, when he had taken the part of Siegmund in a BBC broadcast of Die Walküre. He had never sung Tristan previously and indeed had not performed much opera at all. Alongside the young Linda Esther Gray, cast on Goodall’s insistence as Isolde, he learned the part under the conductor’s tutelage, phrase by phrase, familiarising himself with every detail of the music in conjunction with the text. The working relationship was a good one and he proved to be a persuasive Tristan, refining his interpretation over the course of 18 months, during which he sang 16 performances. As can be witnessed in the Decca recording, made in late 1980 and early 1981, by which time his command of both text and music had matured considerably, he was able to combine a heroic tone and seamless legato with acute sensitivity to the text. Another major role was his Peter Grimes for WNO (1978), to which he brought his signature phrasing, consistently musical in its deployment, as well as a delivery both virile and varied in tone colour. John Copley’s production cleverly disguised Mitchinson’s notoriously untheatrical stage persona by giving him plentiful props to hold and bits of scenery to clutch. Other notable operatic appearances included his impressive singing of the title role in the ENO Oedipus Rex (1972) and his Idomeneus in the ENO Idomeneo (1976), both under Charles Mackerras. He also scored a success in the comic role of Ménélas, King of Sparta, in Scottish Opera’s La Belle Hélène (1995), playing the cuckold with a delightful air of befuddled innocence. Further concert works included Waldemar in Schoenberg’s Gurrelieder, the Verdi Requiem and British music including Vaughan Williams’ On Wenlock Edge and Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius. He sang his last Gerontius with the Philomusica in Tewkesbury Abbey in 2006. Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde he recorded three times, and the Symphony No 8 twice. Other recordings included the Glagolitic Mass, twice, The Dream of Gerontius, Berlioz’s Lélio, Stravinsky’s Les Noces and Renard, and William Alwyn’s Miss Julie. After teaching at the RNCM (1987-92), he was head of vocal studies at what is now the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama until his retirement in 1997. Known for his generosity and sense of humour, he was much loved by his colleagues and students. Despite his celebrity, he remained modest about his achievements. “We’re all entertainers, really”, he maintained: “no better and no worse than the performing dog at the circus.” His wife, the mezzo-soprano Maureen Guy, whom he married in 1958, died in 2015. They are survived by their two sons, David and Mark.

1/24/2022,"Patricia Karvelas is not fazed by a daily 3.30am start and exudes the confidence and enthusiasm of someone who can anchor an agenda-setting national news program like ABC’s RN Breakfast. But “PK”, as she is known to listeners and colleagues alike, is well aware that audiences generally don’t like change. Radio National listeners are sure to miss the calm and assured voice of Fran Kelly, who hosted the flagship radio show for 17 years before stepping down last year to take up a less gruelling role at Aunty.  “What I want to demonstrate to our listeners is that the show’s spirit will continue,” Karvelas told Guardian Australia ahead of her first shift hosting RN Breakfast on Monday. “That’s my first project: to sort of steady the ship. When you lose a host there is a period of grief and adjustment that I’m very prepared for. Because I’ve done it before, I went through it when Waleed Aly moved on [from RN Drive] – the listeners were very attached to him.” From Monday, @PatsKarvelas will take over as host of @RNBreakfast.Good luck, PK! 👏 pic.twitter.com/MFGvzH0qA8 Once the show is bedded down her focus will be on “making sure that it doesn’t sound like a show that now will be coming out of Melbourne”. Breakfast will be produced from Karvelas’s hometown of Melbourne – moving from Sydney under Kelly – but it will have a determinedly national focus. “This country is big and vast and the experiences we have in it are just so diverse and different,” the former host of RN Drive and Afternoon Briefing on ABC News says. “If you’re in the Northern Territory, dealing with the new laws which are putting 10-year-olds back in detention, your experience in this country is vastly different to mine in Melbourne.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Karvelas has always taken a keen interest in Indigenous affairs – dating back to her time as a political reporter at the Australian – but she does not accept the label of activist ascribed to her by Sky After Dark presenter Chris Kenny. When Karvelas was revealed as Kelly’s replacement, Kenny said Fran Kelly, a “left of centre activist”, was being replaced by “another green left activist”. Karvelas bristles with irritation when she hears this. “In the years I worked with him at the Australian newspaper I don’t recall him telling me I was a green left activist,” she says. “I was in a senior role at the newspaper, not in some junior role, but in consistently senior roles appointed by their rightwing management. So I’m assuming that at that stage, they thought that I was a pretty fair and robust reporter. I’m pretty certain that they knew that and he knew that. “Unlike maybe him and some others I’m not a card-carrying member of the Liberal party and I have not worked for Liberal prime ministers or senior Liberal figures. I also haven’t worked for senior Labor figures and I never will. “And that’s something I definitely can guarantee you: I will never work in politics because I don’t believe in it because I am a journalist.” These attacks on her professionalism are nothing new. Karvelas believes one of the reasons ABC management saw her as a successor to Kelly was that she was “battle-hardened” and “knows not to read the comments”. She cares less about what people say about her on Twitter now than when she was an up-and-coming reporter more easily provoked by trolls. “There are people on the left who really don’t see me as captured by them,” she says. “They believe that I need to, you know, basically pursue their agendas or their politics in order to be legit. I won’t do that. And I don’t think it’s my job and the people on the right are unhappy because I don’t declare myself a conservative and I won’t because I’m not a conservative. “What I am interested in is the truth, and sometimes if you pursue the truth and facts they can take you to places unexpected.” Kelly is a hard act to follow but Karvelas is known as one of the most driven people in media and is determined to be successful. She likes to tell students at school talks that hard work is the key to success. “I was never the smartest kid in the room or the prettiest kid in the room, but I was always the hardest working,” she says. Kelly is on a long break over the summer and will return to the ABC in a yet-to-be-announced role.",News/Media,Patricia Karvelas accepts there’ll be a ‘period of grief’ for lost host as new RN Breakfast era begins,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/24/patricia-karvelas-accepts-therell-be-a-period-of-grief-for-lost-host-as-new-rn-breakfast-era-begins
1/24/2022,"One voice, your voice, and our collective voices can make a difference. We are on the precipice of a revolution whose call to action needs to be heard loud and clear. – Grace Tame Women have been angry since Eve. And the responses to that anger are just as old.  We saw it play out as the prime ninister and his government struggled to get a handle on the issues Brittany Higgins’ accusations raised, held up by the swell of voices rushing in behind her. The platitudes and the “that’s terrible, but what can we do” shrugs. The attempts to move on. The pushback and the patronising “when will these emotional women stop being so emotional” sighs. There isn’t a woman alive who wouldn’t recognise the signs. In men, anger, no matter how unreasonable, is always reasonable. At least at first glance. In women, that same anger is irrational – spurred by emotion, not rationality. Men argue, women rant. Men speak with authority, women screech like banshees. Men were driven to it, women must have done something. While expressing my frustration and rage with the political response, one man asked me in jest, “Are you sure you’re not just hormonal?” It was a joke, made in an attempt at irony, but we both knew it was tinged with what he believed to be true. Women everywhere seemed to be angry, and the usual tricks used to calm them weren’t working. You could see the frustration in the male political leaders as they delivered well-rehearsed lines and headed down well-trodden paths of placation, only to be met with stony faces and pointed questions about actual solutions. By the time historical rape allegations against Christian Porter were made public (allegations the former attorney general has vigorously denied), the government’s lack of response had led the resolve of women around the country to harden into steely determination. Women asked for their leaders to listen. They were told, repeatedly, to listen to how much they were not being listened to. It’s not unusual for those in power to be confused by a woman’s anger. Some of the most famous of western civilisation’s myths have been built around the fall of an angry woman. Medusa, raped and betrayed, was understandably angry – and was turned into a Gorgon for her troubles. She was slayed as she slept, her powers then used against her will. Circe handled rejection so poorly she would turn suitors into swine and poison waterways. Cassandra, so beautiful she tempted a god, was then doomed to never be believed when she rejected him. Medea handled Jason’s infidelity and rejection by murdering his new wife and her own children. The Greek spirit of mad rage was encapsulated by Lyssa, a woman. Clytemnestra became synonymous with being every man’s worst nightmare after she murdered her husband for sacrificing their daughter. Eve has never been forgiven for mankind’s first sin, tasting the forbidden fruit. Story after story, myth after myth, women receive comeuppance for their anger and are doomed to live as monsters, cast away from friends and family, or hunted by righteous men. Women have been angry since before they could name the emotion, but they are quickly taught to hide it. Study after study after study into anger show how women suffer professionally from displaying the emotion – while men are rewarded. We see this played out in our personal lives, too. An angry woman is a shrew, unattractive, unlovable and in need of taming. Her voice is too shrill to be heard, her face too flushed, her eyes too full of fire to focus on. Angry women commit the greatest of feminine sins – they make themselves unfuckable. “It’s probably why she’s so angry – no one will fuck her.” “If you would just calm down, then we can talk.” “Just settle, petal.” “Calm your tits.” “You’re taking it too far.” “Keep your hair on!” As with so much of womanhood, anger is framed through the male gaze. Men’s anger is perceived as just, while women’s anger is irrational – and so, when aimed at men, is usually unjust. An angry man is credible. An angry woman is difficult. Add in other institutionalised discrimination, such as being a woman of colour, and there are more stereotypes to contend with, to silence anyone who dares to speak up – not just as a woman but as a woman who is not white. She’ll often find her white “sisters” joining the chorus to drown her out. Girls absorb all those messages at the same time as their ABCs. Boys too. It’s why women’s anger has become such a trope: something men have to suffer, humour or bounce along with – but only to a point. In her 2018 book Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women’s Anger, Soraya Chemaly writes how it is as children that many women “learn to regard anger as unfeminine, unattractive, and selfish … As girls we are not taught to acknowledge or manage our anger so much as to fear, ignore, hide and transform it … ” Women know others will be making those assessments and work to counter them, even as they struggle to make their anger known. So it’s no wonder our leaders are not used to seeing it. It’s no wonder, in the instance of Brittany Higgins, that they believed platitudes and politics as usual would solve it. For the first time in a long, long while, within a long, long list of tragedies and injustices Australians should be angry about, the anger didn’t seem to be dissipating. In fact, it was growing. Women were marching. They were mobilising. They were telling their stories – loudly – and they were refusing to calm down or express their anger in a more palatable way. As one woman I met in a supermarket told me, “It’s liberating to be this angry and not have to hide it.” These were not the first angry women to speak up to their leaders. But here were a lot of straight, white women – a core constituency of the Coalition – refusing to calm down or let the matter drop. Anger can be destructive, but it can also be transformative. Used well, it can bring about a necessary clarity, stripping back all the frosting to what lies rotten underneath. In trying to appease without offering solutions, the government found that anger only grew. And for those feeling that anger, it was cleansing.

1/24/2022,"On New Year’s Eve, on the other side of the world, Ash Fadian’s brother-in-law died of Covid-19. Devastated by the news, Fadian’s thoughts quickly turned to getting from her home in Sydney to the funeral in London.  Fadian is on a bridging visa, one of the only visa types still subject to harsh Covid travel bans preventing her from re-entering Australia without an exemption. Six times Fadian applied for an exemption on compassionate grounds. She showed authorities her brother-in-law’s death certificate and the funeral notice. Despite Omicron already being widespread in New South Wales, and the fact that border restrictions have been eased for all other visa holders, her six applications were rejected. “I’m beyond devastated. I’m just gutted to be treated like this,” she said of being unable to leave to attend the funeral. “I’ve been here four years, and all I’m asking is to attend a funeral. “If this isn’t a compassionate case, then I just don’t know what these people are looking at.” Stories like Fadian’s were common in earlier stages of the pandemic. But the vast majority of temporary visa holders are now able to travel to and from Australia without an exemption, so long as they are fully vaccinated. On Tuesday, the Morrison government went further to encourage visitors to Australia, issuing a plea to working holidaymakers to come and help fill the skills shortage, waiving their application fees as an incentive. “My message to them is come on down,” he said. “We want you to come to Australia and enjoy a holiday here in Australia – move all the way around the country and, at the same time, join our workforce.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The irony of the prime minister’s plea was not lost on Fadian. She came to Australia as a working holidaymaker herself. She is now on a bridging visa while she waits for a replacement working holidaymaker visa. People holding bridging visa B (BVB) are usually allowed to live in Australia and travel abroad while they await government decisions on more permanent visas. But BVB holders like Fadian have found themselves stuck due to a combination of blowouts in visa processing times and the border restrictions, which make it near impossible for them to enter the country or to re-enter after leaving. The government’s treatment of her has left Fadian considering whether she should abandon Australia and her life here. “The fact that I can’t fly home for a funeral, yeah of course it [makes me think about leaving], it makes me think what are their values and their morals?” she said. “I want to get up and go and never come back, but there’s something that’s keeping me here, and that’s because I live here.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app She’s not alone. A petition started by bridging visa holders has now gained 15,000 signatures. Their calls are backed by the independent MP Zali Steggall and the Greens senator Nick McKim. McKim wrote to the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, saying the restrictions for bridging visa holders were causing “immeasurable pain to thousands of people”. “With global visa processing times blowing out significantly across a number of visa classes due to Covid-19, people that are offshore on both expired and valid BVBs [bridging visas] are still not able to return to Australia while their substantive visas are being processed,” he said. Guardian Australia approached Hawke and the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, for a response. The query was referred to the department of home affairs, which said the remaining travel restrictions were needed to “balance the need to safely reopen with the continuing need to protect the Australian community from Covid-19”. “These border policies have contributed to Australia having one of the lowest death rates from Covid-19, strongest economies and highest vaccination rates in the world,” a spokesperson said. “The key principles guiding government decisions on visas while responding to Covid-19, are that our visa system must support public health measures and should not displace job opportunities for Australians.”",News/Australia news,‘I’m beyond devastated’: Sydney woman on bridging visa denied exemption to travel to UK funeral,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/im-beyond-devastated-sydney-woman-on-bridging-visa-denied-exemption-to-travel-to-uk-funeral
1/24/2022,"Australia’s offshore processing regime on Nauru will cost taxpayers nearly $220m over the next six months as it holds 107 people on the Pacific island. Brisbane firm Canstruct International has been awarded a new extension – its eighth non-competitive contract extension – for $218.5m to provide six months of “garrison and welfare services” on Nauru. The company’s total revenue from island contracts over the past five years now totals more than $1.8bn.  It currently costs Australian taxpayers more than $4m a year to hold one person within the Nauru offshore regime – a little over $11,000 per person per day. The government’s latest figures, revealed in Senate estimates, stated 107 people – 81 refugees and 26 asylum seekers – were still held on Nauru. The 81 refugees have had their claim for protection formally recognised. Australia is legally obliged to protect them and they cannot be returned to their home country because they face a “well-founded fear of being persecuted”. While no new asylum seeker arrivals have been sent to Nauru since 2014, the regime continues to cost Australia between $35m and $40m a month on average, the same amount it did when the detention centre held more than 1,000 people. Canstruct’s tenure on Nauru has attracted significant regulatory and parliamentary attention. The October 2017 “letter of intent” awarded to Canstruct International was worth $8m. Less than a month after this was signed, the company won a $385m contract awarded by limited tender, meaning there was not an open and competitive process to secure the initial contract. The auditor general criticised the process, saying “it is not clear why the department could not have secured a replacement supplier using a more competitive procurement method”. Since then, government figures show eight further amendments, all uncontested, have escalated the total cost to $1.82bn. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Questioning before the Senate has revealed other significant irregularities. The Guardian revealed in November that Canstruct International had just $8 in assets and had not commenced trading when it was awarded the contract. A government-ordered “financial strength assessment” – conducted by KPMG to test the suitability of the company – was actually done on a different company. The Canstruct group of companies, or entities associated with it, have made 11 donations to the Liberal National party in Queensland. Canstruct International said it was contractually restricted from responding to a series of questions from the Guardian about the latest amendment. A spokesperson for the department of home affairs said the Australian government remained committed to regional processing as a key pillar of Operation Sovereign Borders. “In support of the government of Nauru’s management of regional processing arrangements, Canstruct continues to provide garrison and welfare services to the regional processing caseload,” they said. “Australia is working with Nauru to establish an enduring regional processing capability in Nauru.” The spokesperson said between 2008 and 2013, more than 50,000 people arrived in Australia by boat seeking asylum and an estimated 1,200 people drowned.

Operation Sovereign Borders has built a multi-layered system of: deterrence and disruption; detection, interception and returns, and; regional processing and third country resettlement.” The shadow home affairs minister, senator Kristina Keneally, said more than four years had passed since the government had handed a lucrative contract to an alleged “shelf company” without a competitive tender and without “conducting basic due diligence on the company”. “Since then, the Morrison government has had countless opportunities to renegotiate this important contract to get a better deal for taxpayers, or to put the contract through a competitive tender process,” Keneally said. “Instead, it keeps extending the contract – paying this private company more and more money to do less and less work.” The former New South Wales auditor general Tony Harris told the Guardian that Canstruct International’s contracts, and the process by which they had been awarded, required further examination. “We can certainly say that the audit office ought to have commented on the KPMG report assessing the wrong company – the fact that it didn’t report on that suggests that it didn’t see it – that’s a major flaw in the report. But the ‘per detainee’ cost is so outrageous now, the audit office should be doing a report on it.” Harris said while the audit office was constrained by time and resources, the expense of Australia’s offshore contracts – and their history of cost blowouts – justified further examination. “I know the audit office has many worthy subject matters vying for its attention, but we have seen with this company and with Paladin [the shelf company awarded the equivalent contract in PNG] that the department has allowed, or been forced into, dealing with companies that have taken full advantage of their monopoly positions at the taxpayers’ expense.” The Canstruct group helped build the Nauru regional processing centre and Canstruct International took over running the centre from Broadspectrum in 2017. The Nauru processing centre became an “open” centre in 2015, allowing some movement outside the camp, and all refugees and asylum seekers were physically moved into the Nauru community in 2019. But the 107 refugees and asylum seekers held by Australia on Nauru cannot leave the island. The processing centre has been plagued by controversy, including reports of alleged violence against asylum seekers and refugees, systemic sexual abuse of children, inadequate medical and psychiatric care, and a spate of acts of self-harm and suicides. The Nauru files – a cache of leaked internal working documents written by staff and published in 2016 before Canstruct took over operations – detailed reports of alleged sexual violence against children as young as six, assaults, and systemic neglect. Separate statements from senior United Nations officials said the Nauru camp was “cruel and inhuman” and a violation of the convention against torture. Médecins Sans Frontières said the mental health suffering on Nauru was “among the most severe MSF has ever seen”.",News/World news,Nauru offshore regime to cost Australian taxpayers nearly $220m over next six months,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/nauru-offshore-regime-to-cost-australian-taxpayers-nearly-220m-over-next-six-months
1/24/2022,"The indirect effects of the pandemic on children and adolescents are as substantial – if not more so – than the impact of being infected with Covid-19, paediatricians say. A research review from the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute led by paediatrician Prof Sharon Goldfeld said interventions needed to be developed now to address growing disparities in child health and wellbeing due to the pandemic.  Goldfeld said children were facing a “generation-defining disruption” with public health restrictions and interventions such as online learning, social distancing, increased screen time, reduced access to healthcare, less community sport and less outside play all having repercussions. “The public health measures have resulted in positive benefits for some, while others have been adversely and inequitably impacted,” Goldfeld said. “Children and adolescents experiencing adversity before the pandemic have been disproportionately affected, potentially leading to a widening of disparities in child health, wellbeing, and developmental outcomes.” The review, published in the Medical Journal of Australia (MJA) on Monday, includes findings from a Royal Children’s hospital poll that found one-third (36%) of Australian parents felt that the pandemic had negatively affected the mental health of their child, and that 31% of parents had delayed or avoided medical care for a sick or injured child due to concerns about catching the virus. A separate study found some children and adolescents infected with the virus experienced stigma and mental health distress such as difficulty sleeping, having nightmares and withdrawing from friends. The review also refers to Kids Helpline data, and paediatric emergency department data, that shows a rapid rise in mental health and self-harm presentations. Associate Prof Nicholas Wood, a paediatrician with the Children’s Hospital Westmead, said he had heard reports of children not wanting to leave their house because they were so anxious and worried about Covid. “I think there’s going to have to be some effort put into resilience-building programs for children, whether that’s through schools or communities,” he said. “There has also always been an issue with access to mental health support in the community. It’s very hard to get your children into a psychologist or psychiatrist, and we must be thinking about these and other services children will need to be accessing during and post-pandemic.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A survey of 5,000 teachers cited in the MJA review found only 35% of them reported their students were learning effectively during lockdowns. The achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students grows at triple the rate during remote learning, the review estimated. Goldfeld said some families lacked the resources and time needed to support their children during remote education. “It will be difficult to predict how long it will take those with lost learning to catch-up, but strategies to identify those left behind and targeted long-term interventions for those especially in low socioeconomic school settings will be critical,” she said.

The review concluded that those children requiring extra care and intervention as a result of the pandemic need to be urgently identified so that intervention programs can be targeted towards them. These programs need to be reviewed for efficacy, the authors of the review wrote. Addressing financial instability through parent financial supplements, more investment in children’s health and wellbeing at school, and screening programs for mental health and wellbeing on return to school were among the other measures suggested by the authors.",News/Australia news,"Australian children facing ‘generation-defining disruption’ due to pandemic, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/australian-children-facing-generation-defining-disruption-due-to-pandemic-experts-say
1/24/2022,"It would be a gross understatement to say the AFLW has changed the Australian sporting landscape. While slow to field an elite women’s competition, since its inception, the league has punched above its weight in flying the flag for diversity and inclusion, particularly in the LGBTIQA+ space. Since AFLW Pride began as a standalone match between Western Bulldogs and Carlton, the Pride banner has risen in prominence across football, culminating in the AFLW Pride Round. But when a campaign is so visible and focused on public image, there is always a risk it is providing cover for a lack of more substantial structural change.  Carlton champion Darcy Vescio and the Suns’ Tori Groves-Little came out as non-binary in the lead up to this year’s round, one of many powerful stories gifted by players and families, coaches and fans, all of whom identify women’s football as a safe place for the LGBTIQA+ community. The flood of individual and collective pronouncements about childhood dreams, family pride, and a sense of belonging would melt the hardest of hearts. These statements and gestures are not just about the players. The AFLW has always had a strong sense of community and connection with the outer. Collingwood super fan Andy posted a Twitter thread articulating the importance of including the transgender flag on the Pies’ Pride jumper. “Today, footy and Collingwood feel like they’re for me,” he wrote. “I can own this. I can wear it, and show up, and scream ‘ball’, and be my truest unfiltered self, and belong.” The importance of this campaign and what it represents cannot be overstated. However, given the inextricable relationship between gender, sexuality and the AFLW, the conversation around inclusion and diversity must also acknowledge the agonising crawl towards gender equity and other glaring gaps in the equity conversation across Australian football. Given the inherently political nature of women playing what was traditionally a “man’s sport” – with anyone not identifying as male forced to fight for a chance to play – it is not surprising women’s football has fomented a culture of activism and progressiveness. It is equally unsurprising that AFLW players and supporters are finding their voice and actively calling out inconsistencies and inequity between the men’s and women’s games. This has been cast in sharp relief by the AFL’s response to Covid. In an Instagram post lamenting the postponement of a second match due to Covid, Western Bulldogs player Nell Morris-Dalton said: “It’s devastating and a reminder of the inequalities that still persist in our league compared to the AFLM.” Noting the AFL’s shift to hubs in 2021 that allowed the season to play out in its entirety, she acknowledged the impracticality of hubs for the AFLW, given the players’ part-time contracts. Ironically, these women suffer a double whammy of disadvantage in Covid times. Their unliveable wage forces them to pursue outside work and careers, which increases their exposure to Covid in the community, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of bringing Covid back to their club, jeopardising their team and their opponents – many share houses with opposition players – and potentially threatening the entire competition. Adelaide Crows champion Erin Phillips has described indefensible limitations imposed on the women’s teams to make way for the men’s, including restricted access to training facilities and soft-capped medical support. Despite the significance of including the trans flag on Pride jumpers, the AFL’s policy on trans women playing at elite levels remains contentious and inconsistent, as noted by another longtime AFLW super fan, Alfie. The original AFLW Pride Carlton v Bulldogs Pride match, postponed due to Covid, has not yet been rescheduled, nor has the round three Bulldogs v Suns replacement match. On Friday, when questioned about the West Coast Eagles’ lack of a Pride jumper, coach Michael Prior said: “We’ve done the pride stuff to death.” The club later apologised “to everyone who was offended”, a textbook non-apology. As one of the richest AFL clubs, their argument that they couldn’t manage a Pride jumper and an Indigenous jumper in the same season is difficult to swallow. Their focus, they said, was on football. Perhaps this was their biggest error. Women’s football has never just been about football. Women’s footy has been playing and advocating for generations. In the end, the Eagles lost to the Crows 1.3 (9) to 6.6 (42). There is no question Pride Round carries enormous weight in cultivating positive and inclusive attitudes among players, fans and the sporting community. However, it is important to acknowledge these campaigns deliver far more in terms of goodwill and positive public image for the AFL and its clubs than the movement gains on the ground. The risk is that such visible and public celebration of diversity and inclusion can substitute for the hard work and structural change that isn’t happening at the level required – in the AFL and the broader community. For real change to take place, the AFL’s efforts to advocate for inclusion and diversity must reach further than creating an impressive shopfront, and must confront some uncomfortable truths. Whether in reference to sexuality, gender, cultural difference, First Nations or disability, diversity and inclusion must be entrenched structurally and culturally in order to generate the sort of change that will bring us closer to true equity and fairness.",Sport/Sport,AFLW Pride round is about more than just rainbows and flags | Nicole Hayes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/aflw-pride-round-is-about-more-than-just-rainbows-and-flags
1/24/2022,"Stackable cubes; hardtop lunchboxes; multi-compartment boxes; bento boxes; multi-level cooler bags; cooler bags the size of a backpack; individual containers – as I sifted through the countless, brightly coloured options for my children’s lunchboxes this year, I began to feel like a disgruntled actor from an informercial, shrugging in defeat and blowing my hair from my eyes. But in my informercial, there was no hero product coming to my rescue. Just more variations of lunchboxes.  Kate Browne, personal finance expert from Finder – who you may recognise as the Guilty Mum from ABC’s series The Checkout – agrees that the process of buying a new lunchbox can be confounding. “Finding the right lunchbox for your child depends on a few factors.” So, what are those factors? “If they are new school starters, look for something that is easy to open with compartments for recess and lunchtime for little people to access,” Browne suggests. Leanne Elliston, who is an accredited practising dietitian, a program manager from Nutrition Australia ACT and a Healthy Lunchbox Week coordinator, echoes this. “A common reason for lunchbox food coming home uneaten is because children could not access their food in the first place,” she says. Elliston suggests doing “a few test runs at home before starting school so your child is confident with opening and closing their lunchbox. That also goes for little reusable containers and zip bags within the lunchbox too”. Take into consideration the type of foods your child is happy to eat at school, and choose a lunchbox that accommodates these. “Around a third of children’s daily food intake comes from the lunchbox so it is essential we include a range of nourishing foods that will support their learning and overall health,” Elliston says. “Providing a balance of foods from each food group” is the aim, but your child’s preferences also matter. “For children who like their food separated and enjoy picking at bits and pieces, a bento style lunchbox might be best,” Elliston says. “For children who love their sandwiches, wraps or rolls then go for one that has plenty of room to prevent the bread from squashing, and also provides enough space for some fruit and vegetable snacks.” She says to go easy on the highly processed packaged snacks. “These foods are usually high in added sugar which can affect children’s ability to concentrate for long periods of time.” They also tend to be excessive in kilojoules and low in nutrients. On the environmental front, they’re not great either. “Most of the rubbish in school bins comes from food packaging brought from home,” Elliston says. Also on waste minimising, Elliston says that auditing your child’s lunchbox won’t just help with selecting a new one; it also helps cut down on food waste. When school starts, she suggests looking at what is left over at the end of the day so you can “avoid overfilling the lunchbox with food your child won’t eat”. Professional organiser Katrina Springer, of the Organised Housewife website, says a key consideration for food safety is ensuring that the materials of the lunchbox or bag you use are made from non-toxic materials. For this, she says to look for BPA-free options. Many lunchboxes available now can be fiddly not just to open, but to clean. Springer suggests placing substance over style and avoiding anything too elaborate. Before you buy a lunchbox, make sure it is dishwasher or washing machine safe. If you have to hand wash, a lunchbox with only one lid will also help prevent bacteria growth. In addition to cleanliness, another aspect to food safety is the heat. “The school term starts in the hottest time of the year so look for a lunchbox that has an ice pack or ice compartment to keep food cool,” Browne says. Heat is also a consideration when it comes to healthy eating. If fresh fruit and vegetables have wilted by lunchtime, they are less likely to be appealing. Browne recommends researching lunchboxes online to find bulk packs and compare prices. “We recommend stores like Amazon, eBay and Catch for these kinds of products,” she says. While it is easy to become caught up in the insta-worthy lunchbox trap and spend lots of money making your child’s lunchbox the most creative and attractive, Elliston says there are better ways to spend your time. A good lunchbox should be “simple, safe and smart”.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Look for something easy to open’: how to pick a good school lunchbox,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/24/look-for-something-easy-to-open-how-to-pick-a-good-school-lunchbox
1/24/2022,"Google has warned of a “devastating” impact on the internet if a court ruling that the search giant is liable for defamatory material contained in hyperlinked pages is not overturned. Google warned in a submission to the high court it will be forced to “censor” its search results if a $40,000 defamation damages award to George Defteros, a solicitor who represented Melbourne gangland figures, is allowed to stand.  Defteros successfully sued Google, arguing its publication of search results that included a 2004 article in the Age about his arrest on conspiracy to murder charges – which were later dropped – defamed him. In 2020, the Victorian supreme court justice Melinda Richards ruled the article had implied that Defteros crossed a line from professional lawyer to confidant and friend to criminal elements. Victoria’s court of appeal rejected a bid from Google to overturn the result. Defteros’ lawyers had contacted Google in 2016 asking for the article to be removed but it refused on the basis the Age was a reputable source. Google’s lawyers told the high court the notice contained “false” claims that Defteros had sued the Age in defamation and the Age had agreed to remove it from its website. Google warned if the court of appeal judgment stands “Google will be liable as the publisher of any matter published on the web to which its search results provide a hyperlink” after a person complains the matter defamed them – “regardless of the quality” of that notice. Even if many of those accessing the article had a “legitimate interest” in it, which should enable the defence of qualified privilege, the search engine would be required to block search results for everyone or else be held liable for those accessing it out of “idle curiosity”, Google said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The tech company argued that it was not a publisher of the material because “a hyperlink is not, in and of itself, the communication of that to which it links”. Websites should only be liable if the hyperlink “actually repeats the defamatory imputation to which it links”, Google said. “The inevitable consequence of leaving the court of appeal’s decision undisturbed is that Google will be required to act as censor by excluding any webpage about which complaint is made from its search results, even when, as here, the webpage may be a matter of legitimate interest to the substantial portion of people who search for it and is published by a reputable news source.” Google argued it should be entitled to the “innocent disseminator” defence unless a complainant could explain what the defamatory meanings of the article were and why they could not be defended. It also asked the high court to reconsider the defence of qualified privilege, arguing it “believed on reasonable grounds” that its users had a legitimate interest in accessing the article. In 2018, the court gave the green light to defamation claims against search engines in a case brought by Milorad Trkulja against Google for a series of images, autocomplete predictions and results that he alleged were defamatory. In September last year, the high court ruled in the Dylan Voller case that social media users, including media companies, were liable as publishers for defamatory third-party comments on their social media posts. In December, the Coalition released draft legislation to counteract the Voller decision by deeming that an Australian person or company with a social media page was not the publisher of third-party comments made by other users. If passed, the bill would deem the social media company the publisher but would provide them with a defence if they had a complaints procedure to help identify anonymous commenters.",News/Technology,Google warns of ‘devastating’ impact if court ruling on defamatory hyperlinks not overturned,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/24/google-warns-of-devastating-impact-if-court-ruling-on-defamatory-hyperlinks-not-overturned
1/24/2022,"From anti-ageing diamonds to topical collagen, I have witnessed a lot of wild claims and eye-watering price tags over a decade of dipping in and out of beauty writing. I’ve also fielded a lot of questions, from friends, family and coworkers. Well, just one question over and over: “What works?” While there are certainly those who treat skincare as a hobby, most people just want something that delivers results, ideally affordably and without having to acquire a degree in organic chemistry to debug the messaging on the packaging.  When it comes to skincare basics like cleanser and moisturiser, pretty much everything on the market will clean your face or make it feel moist for a time, so finding something that works is largely down to personal preference about price; scent (or lack thereof); your subjective experience of texture; and how you’d like to use the product (a makeup remover you use in the shower isn’t going to make sense for someone who bathes at dawn). But for products that deal with specific concerns like acne, redness and rosacea, dryness and signs of ageing like fine lines and sunspots, Australia has a regulatory framework to ensure some skincare products deliver on their promises. While cosmetic products in Australia are tested for safety but not efficacy, if your skincare is classified as a registered medicine, there has to be evidence that it works. Some therapeutic skincare products are only available with a prescription, while others are sold over the counter. There’s a good chance you’re already using at least one – sunscreen, which is regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration if it’s got an SPF of 15 or higher. And if you’re not using sunscreen but you’re even vaguely interested in caring for your skin, please change that immediately – it’s the lowest hanging fruit on the tree. Now that we’ve all slipped, slopped and slapped, let’s move on. Whether you’re concerned with pimples, rosacea or the overall appearance over your skin, look out for products that are registered as medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Typically, these are much cheaper than luxury skincare products. While expensive, booking an appointment with a dermatologist will allow you to come up with an effective, active skincare plan suited to your needs (just don’t let them upsell you on pricey cosmeceuticals that aren’t actually medicine). There is also an increasing number of services that offer skincare consultations online and via telehealth that will deliver a tailored set of prescription-only products to you. But your first port of call should be your GP, who may well be able to offer suggestions, advice and even scripts. This isn’t to say that skincare products that are not registered as medicines don’t work – just that they don’t have to work. Talking to a doctor is slightly more effort than showing up to the cosmetics counter and asking “what’s good”, but it is more likely to deliver results, which will ultimately save you time (on research) and money (on fancy creams that don’t work out).",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: skip the cosmetics counter and put your doctor in charge of your skincare,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/24/easy-wins-skip-the-cosmetics-counter-and-put-your-doctor-in-charge-of-your-skincare
1/24/2022,"The New South Wales government could be forced to spend another $4.1bn over the next decade to address “significant uncertainties” surrounding a controversial $40bn rail corporation it set up to inflate the state’s budget bottom line. The auditor general, Margaret Crawford, has given the long-awaited signoff on the state’s finances after a three-month delay caused by concerns surrounding the establishment of the Transport Asset Holding Entity, or Tahe, which holds $40bn in NSW rail assets.  Crawford in 2021 delayed the release of the state’s audited finances as a result of “significant accounting issues” with Tahe – a move that forced the state to inject $1.1bn into the transport system to meet the auditor’s concerns. While she has now signed off on the state’s finances, the auditor has flagged that significant uncertainties remain surrounding the financial assumptions underpinning Tahe. In comments attached to the state’s finances, Crawford noted that predictions outlined by NSW Treasury remained “highly dependent” on revenue which “may not eventuate”, and revealed taxpayers would need to contribute another $4.1bn over the next decade to satisfy accounting standards associated with Tahe. The NSW government established Tahe in 2015 as a way of transferring the state’s $40bn rail assets out of the hands of the transport department and into a state-owned corporation. The decision had significant benefits for the government’s bottom line. Because Tahe could lease the state’s rail assets back to service operators such as Sydney Trains, the government could classify funding to the corporation as “equity injections” which did not have a negative impact on the budget. But under accounting rules, Tahe was required to show both that the entity remained entirely independent of the government and that it would turn a profit. In November, the auditor said “significant accounting issues” remained with the body, and delayed signing off on the state’s finances. “We are not in a position to sign the audit,” she said at the time. “The matters are very complex and there are a lot of discussions going on around these matters.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The auditor’s concerns meant that in December the NSW government was forced to provide $1.1bn in additional funding to the state’s transport department to pay for a huge increase in fees paid to Tahe for access to the state’s rail assets. The increase was confirmed in a heads of agreement deal signed on 18 December 2021 between Tahe and its “customers”, the state’s rail networks. “The heads of agreement reflects Tahe’s intention to negotiate higher access and licence fees to deliver on shareholder’s expectation of a return of 2.5% and includes proposed indicative future access and licence fees,” the auditor noted in her report. In the report, the auditor general revealed the $1.1bn in extra funding only extended to the 2024-25 financial year and that another $4.1bn would be required over the life of the 10-year agreement. That additional funding had been “broadly communicated” to the government’s expenditure review committee “but is yet to be provided for in government budget figures”, she wrote. “As described in the 2020-21 half year review, for the period to 2024-25 an additional $1.1bn has been allocated to Transport for NSW to be provided to rail operators consistent with the updated shareholder expectations for Tahe,” she said. “While the half year review does not embed approved funding beyond 2024-25, the heads of agreement attaches an indicative financial profile which indicates access and licence fees increase by an additional $4.1 billion over the following six years.” She also wrote that a “significant portion” of the revenue required to meet accounting standards was outside the 10-year contact “and there is a risk that Tahe will not be able to re-contract for access and licence fees at a level that is consistent with current projections”. “There is also a risk that funding for Tahe’s key customers will not be sufficient to fund payment of access and licence fees at a level that is consistent with current projections,” Crawford wrote. On Sunday, the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, trumpeted the release of the “unqualified audit opinion” as evidence the government had provided “a true and accurate reflection of the financial position of the state”. “What this shows is that, despite claims to the contrary, the NSW finances are now validated and verified as accurate by the NSW auditor general based on her unqualified opinion,” Kean said. But Labor’s shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, said the auditor general’s comments showed taxpayers would be forced to “plunge even further into debt to stop Tahe from unravelling the state’s finances”. Labor claims the cost to the budget is likely to be nearer to $7bn over the life of the agreement with the state’s rail operators based on projected access fees included in the finances. “Tahe was always a budget con. But now it’s become a full-blown budget disaster,” Mookhey said. “Every dollar spent on Tahe is a dollar denied to the tens of thousands of small businesses fighting to survive the Omicron lockdown. Those businesses deserve the extra $4.1bn Mr Perrottet is paying Tahe – especially since Tahe is nothing more than an accounting sham.”",News/Australia news,‘Accounting sham’: transport body set up to improve NSW’s budget bottom line could need $4.1bn injection,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/accounting-sham-transport-body-set-up-to-improve-nsws-budget-bottom-line-could-need-41bn-injection
