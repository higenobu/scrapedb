5/19/2022,"Fifa should pay reparations of at least $440m (£356m) to migrant workers whose human rights have been compromised by the Qatar World Cup, a group of non-governmental organisations has said. England and Gareth Southgate have been asked to support the initiative, described as an “innovative scheme” that would “provide some real redress” for workers, as attempts to leave a positive legacy for the tournament come into focus six months before the opening World Cup fixture in Doha. Amnesty International, alongside Human Rights Watch, Football Supporters Europe and the trade union the Building and Wood Workers’ International are among those calling for a remediation scheme that would address the documented failings of human rights protections which have scarred the history of Qatar’s World Cup. According to the organisations, Fifa should “reserve an amount not less than the $440m prize money offered to teams participating in the World Cup, to be invested in funds to support remediation. This would represent just a small percentage of Fifa’s anticipated $6bn revenues from the tournament and the $1.6bn it holds in reserves. “This amount reflects a likely ‘floor’ for the scale of harm suffered. The final amount required for remedy will be determined by the scale of the need, the harms to be redressed and reparation measures to be offered, should be decided through a participatory process and subject to an independent evaluation.” Sacha Deshmukh, the CEO of Amnesty International UK, called on England to support the idea. “We hope the FA and Gareth Southgate and the players will back this innovative scheme,” he said. “International football can easily afford to do the right thing here. This is a comparatively small share of Fifa’s enormous prize money pot – and it would provide some real redress for the serious human rights violations that underpin this tournament.” Fifa, in response, said it was “assessing” the proposals. It said it had put in place “an unprecedented due diligence process” in relation to the protection of workers and – alongside the Qatari Supreme Committee responsible for tournament – had devised its own remediation processes. This includes $22.6m transferred to workers by the end of 2021 to redress the particular issue of recruitment fees often paid by migrant workers to agencies or brokers to secure employment.",Sport/Football,NGO group says Fifa should pay £356m reparations to Qatar migrant workers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/ngo-group-says-fifa-should-pay-356m-reparations-to-qatar-migrant-workers
5/19/2022,"More than 42 million adults in the UK will be overweight or obese by 2040 and at higher risk of 13 types of cancer, an “alarming” report reveals, as health leaders accused ministers of “kicking the can down the road” when it comes to tackling the obesity crisis. Data collected by Cancer Research UK (CRUK) shows that 71% of people will be overweight by 2040, a rise from 64% today. Of these, almost 36% of adults – 21 million people – will be obese. The charity described the figures as “staggering”. “These projections should serve as a wake-up call to the government about the state of our nation’s health,” said Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of CRUK. “Ministers mustn’t keep kicking the can down the road when it comes to tackling the obesity crisis – delaying measures that will lead to healthier food options.” Last week, the government announced it was delaying measures to tackle unhealthy eating for 12 months. The former Conservative party leader William Hague said the weakening of the anti-obesity strategy was “morally reprehensible”. The U-turn will mean a ban on buy-one-get-one-free deals for foods high in fat, salt and sugar will be postponed for 12 months. A ban on TV junk food adverts before a 9pm watershed has also been put on hold for a year. “I urge them to revisit this decision and take bold action on obesity, the second biggest preventable risk factor for cancer in the UK,” said Mitchell. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of at least 13 different types of cancer and also causes other conditions such as high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. In the UK, an estimated 22,800 cases of cancer are attributed to obesity every year. The CRUK report suggests the number of people who are obese could overtake the number who are a healthy weight as early as the late 2020s in England and late 2030s in Northern Ireland. For Scotland and Wales, the crossover is not expected to happen before 2040. Prevalence of severe obesity (a body mass index above 40) is expected to almost double across the UK from 3% to 6%. About 60% of women are currently overweight or obese but this is projected to rise to 67% by 2040. Among men, 74% will be overweight or obese by 2040, up from 68% now. The report also suggests those experiencing higher levels of deprivation could suffer the most. In 2019, 35% of people living in the most deprived areas of England were obese. This is predicted to increase to 46% by 2040. In comparison, 22% of people living in the least deprived areas were obese in 2019, with a predicted rise to 25% by 2040. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health and patient information at CRUK, said: “Obesity is a complex issue and the world around us can make it very difficult to keep a healthy weight. “Government action is key in making sure that the healthy option is readily available and affordable for people and addressing the wider barriers that prevent people from living healthy lives. If these staggering trends continue, obesity will eclipse smoking as the biggest cause of cancer.”",News/Society,More than 42m UK adults ‘will be overweight by 2040’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/more-than-42m-uk-adults-will-be-overweight-by-2040
5/19/2022,"Hospital admissions for people with eating disorders in England have risen 84% in the last five years, official NHS figures reveal. There were 11,049 more admissions for illnesses such as bulimia and anorexia in 2020-21 than in 2015-16, with 24,268 admissions in total. Experts described the increase as “alarming”. The number of children and young people admitted to hospital with eating disorders grew from 3,541 to 6,713, with a 35% increase in the last year alone as the Covid pandemic hit, according to the analysis by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. A particularly stark rise in admissions – 128% – was seen in boys and young men, from 280 hospital admissions in 2015-16 to 637 in 2020-2021. The college has published guidelines to help health professionals identify people whose eating disorders have become life-threatening and get them the right care. It said the signs that somebody was dangerously ill could be missed at GP surgeries and in A&E due to a lack of guidance and training. Even when seriously unwell, people with eating disorders can appear to be healthy, with normal blood tests, the college said. For example, somebody with anorexia can have dangerously low levels of electrolytes such as potassium that are not reflected in blood tests. Patients with bulimia can also have severe electrolyte disturbances and stomach problems but can be a normal weight or overweight. Dr Dasha Nicholls, who chaired the development of the medical emergencies in eating disorders guidelines, said: “Eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating don’t discriminate, and can affect people of any age and gender. “They are mental health disorders, not a ‘lifestyle choice’, and we shouldn’t underestimate how serious they are. Even though anorexia nervosa is often referred to as the deadliest mental health condition, most deaths are preventable with early treatment and support. Full recovery is possible if spotted and treated early.” She said there was a need to raise awareness of common eating disorder symptoms. “Our guidance encourages healthcare professionals to spot when someone is dangerously ill, and dispel the myths surrounding them,” she said. “They remain poorly understood, with devastating consequences for thousands of patients and their families. “If we are to stop the eating disorders epidemic in its tracks, it is vital that this guidance reaches healthcare professionals urgently and that government backs them with the necessary resources to implement them.” One in five deaths of people with anorexia are due to suicide, while there are high rates of self-harm and depression with all eating disorders. James Downs, 32, who developed anorexia at the age of 15, had to wait more than six years after being diagnosed to receive specialist support. He blamed a lack of awareness of the signs of eating disorders getting worse among non-specialist healthcare professionals. In the six years it took to get support, his illness took hold and his physical health deteriorated. Downs was frequently admitted to hospital with low potassium levels, low blood sugar, heart abnormalities and other consequences of malnutrition. “Getting help early could prevent so many people from being admitted to hospital,” he said. “All healthcare professionals should be able to spot the signs and have timely and accessible treatments to offer patients.”  In the UK, Beat can be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

5/19/2022,"Ken Bruce has retained his title as the most listened-to radio presenter in the UK, as the Radio 2 host continues the trend of mid-morning programmes attracting more listeners than breakfast shows. The pre-lunchtime 10am slot was traditionally seen as a radio backwater, as mocked by Steve Coogan’s Alan Partridge presenting a show called Mid Morning Matters. By contrast, the breakfast show tended to be the biggest show on any station’s lineup, with people tuning in as they got ready for work, headed to school or drove their car. Years of changing listening habits, exacerbated by the pandemic, have now upended the status quo on many stations, according to the latest Rajar listening figures, which cover the first three months of 2022. Bruce attracted 8.4 million listeners a week, beating the 7.4 million people who tuned in to Zoë Ball’s breakfast show. Other mid-morning shows that are reaching more people than their station’s breakfast programmes include those of LBC’s James O’Brien, TimesRadio’s Matt Chorley and Classic FM’s Alexander Armstrong, according to analysis by the audio consultancy Hallett Arendt. The pattern is not universal – Radio 4’s Today programme continues to outperform the rest of the station’s output with 6.5 million listeners a week, while Heart’s Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden host the biggest commercial breakfast show in the UK with 3.9 million listeners. But it does suggest a wider shift in listening habits that is forcing radio schedulers to reconsider when they deploy their biggest names. BBC 6 Music also celebrated its 20th year on air by attracting a record audience of 2.8 million listeners. There is further evidence that smart speakers – such as Amazon’s Alexa – are increasingly replacing standalone radio sets in people’s houses. The devices, which only took off in popularity in the last few years, already account for about 10% of all radio listening in the UK. They pose a challenge for established radio stations as listeners are prompted to choose a station every time they turn on, rather than leaving a radio constantly tuned to the same outlet. Elsewhere, the continuing boom in speech radio and political debate has benefited Rupert Murdoch’s TimesRadio, which grew its audience by 40% to 703,000 listeners a week. TalkRadio, its culture war-loving sister radio station, also hit a record audience figure of 650,000 listeners – causing much delight among some of the station’s staff, who said they have grown the audience over several years while producing shows on a tight budget. They compared the station’s high listening figures to the poor viewing figures of the channel’s talkTV offshoot, the big-budget television show fronted by Piers Morgan. Both speech outlets remain far behind LBC, owned by the media company Global, which has a national audience of 3.5 million listeners a week and continues to attract listeners with its opinionated hosts. The rightwing current affairs television channel GB News has also begun broadcasting its audio feed as a national radio station. It managed to attract 239,000 people a week.",Arts/Television & radio,Ken Bruce remains most popular UK radio host as mid-morning trend prevails,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/19/ken-bruce-remains-most-popular-uk-radio-host-as-mid-morning-trend-prevails
5/19/2022,"A rare stone circle has been found at a prehistoric ritual site in Cornwall, with seven regularly spaced pits mapped by a team of archaeologists. Bracken and scrub were cleared over the winter at Castilly Henge near Bodmin to allow archaeologists to survey the site. They found the pits lying in a crooked horseshoe formation. Experts believe the pits may once have formed a complete ring but ground conditions at the time of the survey left archaeologists unable to gather clear data on the northern part of the henge interior. Some stones had been removed and taken elsewhere, while others were probably pushed face down into the pits in which they once stood upright. Castilly Henge is believed to have been built during the late Neolithic period, about 3,000–2,500BC. Defined by an external bank and an internal ditch, the henge formed an amphitheatre-style setting for gatherings and ritual activities. Not all henges contain a stone circle, and there is only one other in Cornwall – Stripple stones on the slopes of Hawk’s Tor on Bodmin Moor. Archaeologists believe henge sites would have been used for gatherings and rituals. Research at Castilly Henge began in 2021 when it was included in a scheme by Historic England to conserve and repair monuments on its at-risk register. Volunteers led by the Cornwall Archaeology Unit cleared the site of vegetation that was threatening features of the site hidden below ground. This enabled teams from Historic England to carry out the first detailed topographic and geophysical surveys of Castilly Henge. Peter Dudley, a senior archaeologist at Cornwall Archaeological Unit, said the management of the “amazing archaeological site” has been improved with re-fencing. “Now the monument is looking so much better.” Ann Preston-Jones, a project officer for at-risk heritage sites with Historic England, said: “The research at Castilly Henge has given us a deeper understanding of the complexity of this site and its importance to Cornish history over thousands of years. It will help us make decisions about the way the monument is managed and presented, so that it can be enjoyed by generations to come.” There is evidence to suggest Castilly Henge was used as a theatre in the middle ages and a gun emplacement during the English civil war.",News/UK news,Rare stone circle found at prehistoric ritual site in Cornwall,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/rare-stone-circle-found-castilly-henge-prehistoric-ritual-site-cornwall
5/19/2022,"Glory comes in many forms and it came for Kevin Trapp in the form of an astonishing save in the final minute of extra time. When Kemar Roofe’s cross was deflected into the path of Ryan Kent six yards out, a late winner seemed certain. But Trapp scuttled across his goal, spread himself and the ball cannoned away off his outstretched right leg, a block rooted in hour upon hour on the training ground, honing reflexes and response times, getting the angles right. He had four years at Paris Saint-Germain, but that save, even more than keeping out Aaron Ramsey’s penalty in the shootout, is what will define his career. In his second spell at Frankfurt, he became the man who won them their second European trophy. A balmy night in southern Spain, a tight stadium with two steeply banked tiers, two enormously passionate fanbases, and it was possible to believe all is right with football. That it went to extra time, that weary players, hair drenched with sweat, were forced to drag aching limbs through more gruelling minutes, felt entirely appropriate. It may even be right that the final 10 minutes of the 90 seemed to consist entirely of Rangers taking throw-ins on their left flank. The flares, the smoke, the small posse of riot police in surprisingly shiny helmets. This is what these nights are supposed to look like and this, after all, is what these events are supposed to be about: a great sense of occasion for two teams for whom European success feels not a birthright but an almost impossible quest. There have been plenty of Europa League finals that have felt as though they were mere consolation at the end of a disappointing season, but not here. For Rangers, the second-best team in Scotland, and Eintracht Frankfurt, the 11th-best team in Germany, this was an occasion beyond all expectation. These are campaigns that will be talked about for decades to come: the goals, the drama, the inconvenient journeys. And if the stadium at the end of it felt a little old-fashioned, the aisles tight, the signage inadequate, the toilets and bars almost overwhelmed, that was part of the charm. When Celtic reached the Uefa Cup final in Seville in 2003, they played at the miserable open bowl of the Olimpico a little way out of town. The Sánchez Pizjuán, with its famous tiled facade, is far more romantic than that: even the drunkest fan, as many proved, could just about manage the stagger there from the bars just north of the Alcázar. It was noisy and it was fervent. Rarely can quite so many fans have been dressed in team colours: the Frankfurt end almost entirely white, the Rangers end blue speckled with the occasional orange, some sections a mix of the two. A reported 5,500 police had been designated to the game, but most of them must have been deployed outside the stadium. Inside such segregation as existed was enforced by thin lines of yellow-tabarded stewards. Given anxieties before the game that seemed a risk but, within the stadium at least, everything passed off peacefully. There had been talk of 150,000 fans descending on Seville, but the numbers fell significantly short of that mark; the Frankfurt supporters who remained in Germany themselves created an astonishing atmosphere watching on a big screen in the Deutsche Bank Park. Fears of violence, though, were not exaggerated. Although for much of the day fans mixed happily enough, there were clashes at the west end of the bridge where Calle Enramadilla crosses Avenida San Francisco Javier, prompted, it appeared, by a group of perhaps 200 Frankfurt fans attacking Rangers ones seated outside bars. Punches and kicks were exchanged, there was a lot of posturing and some plastic furniture was thrown. The previous night, five Germans had been arrested after flares were hurled at Rangers fans. The game, in truth, rather struggled to live up to the atmosphere but even that gave it a pleasingly retro feel. The old European finals tended to be about anxiety and grind rather than overt brilliance. But they were about glory just the same. When Joe Aribo had left Charlton for Rangers in 2019, their manager Lee Bowyer had told him he was making a big mistake. But when Tuta’s slip left him clean through against Trapp 12 minutes into the second half, the possibility suddenly opened up that he could be the hero, that he could be the man to give Rangers their first European trophy in 50 years. And however cynical modern football may be, even that opportunity is surely worth a lot. Aribo took his chance, rather more cleanly than might have been expected from somebody who hadn’t scored in 18 previous European ties this season, but there were further twists to come. Ibrox immortality was dangled before him and then snatched away by Rafael Borré’s equaliser. But glory was seeking a host, and it found one in the form of Trapp. Ten years ago, he had been sent off after 19 minutes of his debut for the club. It has been a long wait, but on a night that evoked European finals of old, his transition to hero was complete.",Sport/Football,Kevin Trapp’s career-defining save lights up final for Euro nostalgists | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/18/kevin-trapp-career-defining-save-lights-up-europa-league-final-nostalgists-rangers-eintracht-frankfurt
5/19/2022,"Rafael Santos Borré stood alone in front of a sea of blue. All that, a long hot night in Seville and an even longer wait stretching back half a century, and it came to this: one shot to clinch Eintracht Frankfurt’s first European trophy in 42 years. The Colombian, who had scored in the quarter-final, semi-final and again in the final to bring them to this penalty shootout, ran up and scored again. The ball flew beyond Allan McGregor, history made. At the other end of the Sánchez Pizjuán, Eintracht’s fans went wild, an extraordinary, unexpected run completed. Rangers’ fans, meanwhile, fell silent for the first time, although those that stayed would stand to applaud players who had given everything and were now broken, a unique opportunity snatched from them. Fifty years they had waited for a European trophy; who knows how much longer they will have to wait for another chance. They had led for just over 10 minutes, only to see Borré equalise. Then a glorious 118th-minute chance for Ryan Kent would have won it only for Kevin Trapp to make an extraordinary save from close range, the follow-up from Steven Davis somehow deflecting over the bar. That meant this final went to penalties. It was a scenario they had practised for and Aaron Ramsey had been sent on precisely to take one, but he watched Trapp save again, a crazy 19-game ride finally over in the cruellest way. So close, but defeated at the last. It had been tense at times, and it had been some occasion too. The city was packed, the Pizjuán loud. And the game was lively at times too. Certainly when these two sides, built for the break, were able to get up and running. Eintracht especially, at least to start with, Daichi Kamada taking a touch too many when the first opportunity dropped, eventually stopped by McGregor, and Djibril Sow’s unable to put away the follow up. Ansgar Knauff, JesLindstrom and Sow all had shots too, at a time when the battle for the wing announced between James Tavernier and Filip Kostic was being won by the Serb, a muscular, dynamic and very direct presence. A recurring one, too. He struck a clever shot onto the roof of the net from 20 yards and then went flying up the pitch from one area to the other only to pull wide on half an hour. Eintracht’s shot count was in double figures now; Rangers had taken just that one, although with Scott Wright getting more of the ball, John Lundstram’s header was tipped over by Trapp. And Gio van Bronckhorst’s team took the lead too, a simple Connor Goldson header returning a goal kick did the damage. Sow misjudged it, diverting the ball towards his own goal. Tuta slipped and suddenly Joe Aribo was away, running at supporters who erupted when he slotted the ball beyond Trapp. For a moment, Eintracht seemed to find it hard to comprehend what had happened, but they knew they had to take a step forward; they also knew Rangers were more likely to take a step back. A superb recovery from Calvin Bassey prevented Knauff from getting away. Then Kamada, alone in the area, lifted his shot over McGregor and on to the roof of the net, fists beating at the turf in frustration. But Eintracht did level when Kostic’s cross passed by four men in blue, Goldson the last one to see it go, just as Borré nipped in front of him at the near post to turn it into the net. Eintracht pressed, McGregor pushing away and Kostic flashing just wide, but it was Rangers who almost avoided extra time when Glen Kamara’s 95th-minute attempt was blocked. On it went, Scott Arfield, the sub, hitting over. Bassey would then have gifted Eintracht a wonderful chance but for the fact that few recover like he does and so, having missed the ball and twisted himself into knots, he unravelled again and chased down Borré inside the area. He then matched Knauff, forcing his opponent into a hurried shot. The legs were heavy, the efforts tired but not spared, even if the fear of defeat weighed as heavy as the determination to win and the errors were accumulating, shots often taken too early. Davis had one blocked and then Borna Barisic stung Trapp’s palms, beyond 105 minutes now. Ajdin Hrustic pulled wide. Kristijan Jakic swung over the bar, head turned to to the sky. Thoughts turned to the shootout, substitutions made with that in mind. And as those final seconds ticked away, an astonishing save by Trapp, denying Kent from just five yards out, ensured they got there, giving him another chance to be a hero, history made for Eintracht at Rangers’ expense.",Sport/Football,Rangers suffer Europa League final shootout defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/eintracht-frankfurt-rangers-europa-league-final-match-report
