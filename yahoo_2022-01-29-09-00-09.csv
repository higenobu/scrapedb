1/29/2022,"Following Neil Young’s withdrawal from Spotify Wednesday to protest the streaming service’s popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast — which has come under fire for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines — Young has been declared a “hero” by fans, peers, and even the director of the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, the backlash against Spotify continues to escalate. However, it remains to be seen if Young’s boycott will make a real difference, or if other major artists will follow his lead. The clash between Young, Spotify, and Rogan began Jan. 24, when Young, outraged that The Joe Rogan Experience was “potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread,” wrote on his Neil Young Archives site: “I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform. They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” On Jan. 26, Spotify heeded the classic rocker’s ultimatum and sided with Rogan, entirely removing Young’s catalog from its service. (Rogan has yet to address the controversy.) Perhaps it is not surprising that Spotify chose Rogan over Young. In 2019, Spotify, which is at its core a tech company and not a music company, announced plans to dominate “the emerging podcast marketplace,” purchasing podcast companies like Gimlet Media, Anchor, and Ringer for nine-figure sums. The following year, Spotify made a massive investment by signing a $100 million exclusive deal with Rogan; at that time, research analyst Stephanie Liu told the New York Times, “This is part of Spotify’s bigger bet on podcasts. Spotify is buying not only Joe Rogan’s extensive and future content library, but also his loyal audience.” The Joe Rogan Experience went on to become Spotify’s most-streamed podcast of 2021, with an estimated 11 million listeners per episode; that same year, Spotify reportedly overtook Apple Podcasts as the largest podcast provider in the United States. In a second open letter Wednesday, Young acknowledged that Spotify “represents 60 percent” of his music globally and the wholesale removal of his catalog from the platform would be “a huge loss for my record company to absorb.” In a new open letter Friday, he stressed, “I support free speech. I have never been in favor of censorship. Private companies have the right to choose what they profit from, just as I can choose not to have my music support a platform that disseminates harmful information. I am happy and proud to stand in solidarity with the front line health care workers who risk their lives every day to help others.” Among the public figures praising Young and his record label, Warner/Reprise, for taking a stand despite the financial risk was WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who tweeted, “Thanks for standing up against misinformation and inaccuracies around #COVID19 vaccination. Public and private sector, in particular #socialmedia platforms, media, individuals — we all have a role to play to end this pandemic and infodemic.” (Earlier this month, 270 doctors, scientists, and educators published their own open letter to Spotify, saying that Rogan allowing airing such misinformation — including a claim by immunologist Dr. Robert Malone that vaccines using mRNA technology are ineffective — could “damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals.”) .@NeilYoungNYA, thanks for standing up against misinformation and inaccuracies around #COVID19 vaccination.Public and private sector, in particular #socialmedia platforms, media, individuals - we all have a role to play to end this pandemic and infodemic.https://t.co/kcFyIZQF7T — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) January 27, 2022 Other celebrities tweeting their support of Young’s Spotify boycott have included Americana singer-songwriter Margo Price (“If all artists were as punk rock as Neil Young maybe we wouldn’t be getting absolutely screwed by corporate streaming companies”); author Amy Siskind (“Neil Young is a hero. That’s all. That’s the tweet”); British pop star Kate Nash commented (“I really admire Neil Young for pulling his music from Spotify”); comedian Tom Scharpling (“Love the clowns who are laughing as if Neil Young ever thought Spotify would drop Joe Rogan. The guy took a stand, put his money where his mouth is. Forced a s****y company to make a true colours-revealing decision. This is just one of the many reasons Neil is an all-timer”); and even Geraldo Rivera (“I’m with #NeilYoung”). Catherine Mayer, the widow of punk agitators Gang of Four’s mastermind Andy Gill, addressed Spotify in her own open letter, writing: “If my beloved husband, Andy Gill, hadn’t died at the start of the pandemic, he’d have strong and clear feelings about your decision to remove Neil Young’s music in favor of a podcast that has spread anti-vax misinformation. If vaccines had been available at the start of the pandemic, he’d be here to have that conversation with you. Instead, I must speak for him. And I have to tell you, as his widow, I feel sick about the business decision you’ve made.” Gang of Four’s catalog is available on Apple Music, but not on Spotify. Young has noted that his 60 years’ worth of material will still stream on Apple, as well as on other platforms like Amazon and Qobuz. In his Friday essay, he quipped that an “unexpected bonus” of leaving Spotify is “I sound better everywhere else.” (Young’s peer Peter Frampton tweeted, “Good for you Neil. I’ve always been an Apple guy for streaming. No Joe Rogan for me thank you!”)  The home of Neil Young.Listen to his entire catalog on Apple Music: https://t.co/sUGtz4JbB9 pic.twitter.com/YgRMygUqhi — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) January 28, 2022 Apple has seized upon this marketing opportunity, tweeting, “It’s always a good idea to stream @NeilYoungNYA” and pinning a post to its Twitter profile declaring Apple Music “The home of Neil Young.” Qobuz is currently promoting a nearly five-hour playlist of essential Young tracks. And another Spotify competitor/alternative, SiriusXM, has relaunched its Neil Young Radio on channel 27, promising “rarities and exclusives, every new song from his latest album Barn, epic hits and fan favorites from his solo music, collaborations with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby Stills Nash & Young, plus Neil sharing the insights behind writing and recording the music.” Meanwhile, Spotify’s own PR team is attempting to dispel the rumor that the company, which boasts 172 million subscribers and 381 million monthly users, has pulled the plug on its live-support customer service function after being flooded with requests from angry users attempting to cancel their subscriptions and switch to another service. “Spotify has not shut down our customer support,” a spokesperson insisted in an email statement to Yahoo Entertainment Friday afternoon. “Yesterday our team posted a message saying they ‘may be slow to respond,’ pointing users to other sources of information if they needed anything immediately. As of this morning, our customer support team is functioning as usual, meaning we have advisors staffed around the clock and available to help within minutes.” BREAKING: Spotify has shutdown its live customer support due to an unprecedented number of complaints after they doubled-down on their Joe Rogan anti-vax campaign pic.twitter.com/yscw97xTkt — LeGate (@williamlegate) January 27, 2022 As for other Spotify rumors, it was reported Thursday that easy-listening icon Barry Manilow had also quit the platform, but he clarified in a Friday tweet that this is untrue. While Young and Warner/Reprise’s bold move has drawn widespread praise in the music industry, as of this writing, no other major recording artist has followed his lead since Wednesday.

I don’t know where it started, but it didn’t start with me or anyone who represents me. — Barry Manilow (@barrymanilow) January 28, 2022 In his Wednesday missive, Young wrote, “I sincerely hope that other artists and record companies will move off the Spotify platform and stop supporting Spotify’s deadly misinformation about COVID.” In his Friday essay, the rocker, who has long criticized Spotify’s audio quality, bashed the service again for its “s***ty, degraded and neutered sound.” Young concluded with the argument, “If you support Spotify, you are destroying an art form.” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: Neil Young: ‘I don’t feel like I’ve got a lot of years, but I don’t feel old’ Neil Young to finally release animated 'Trans' film: 'People will hear the album the way I wanted' Neil Young, Daryl Hannah talk ‘Paradox’ film: ‘We’re very lucky to have found each other’ Follow Lyndsey on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Amazon",Business/Yahoo Music,"Spotify backlash continues after Neil Young's boycott: 'If you support Spotify, you are destroying an art form'",https://news.yahoo.com/spotify-backlash-continues-after-neil-youngs-boycott-222712505.html
1/29/2022,"Former President Donald Trump this week all but declared he'll run for president in 2024. But experts say it takes more than hints for him to be legally required to register with election regulators. Trump gains advantages by delaying a formal announcement that he's running for office, some experts say. Clad in a white polo shirt and red ""Make America Great Again"" hat, Donald Trump lined up to hit a golf ball. ""First on tee — 45th president of the United States,"" a man off-camera declares in a now-viral video. Trump then interjects: ""The 45th and the 47th."" It's the latest in a litany of hints, suggestions, and near-declarations that Trump's offered about whether he'll run for president in 2024. But Trump must make more than a few indicative remarks for the federal government to require him to officially register as a presidential candidate and begin adhering to financial disclosure and fundraising limit requirements, election experts say. ""There's no law against joking, bloviating, speculating, or predicting, said Brad Smith, chairman and founder of the Institute for Free Speech and a former Federal Election Commission chairman. To become an official candidate, Trump needs to put money where his mouth is. He would have to raise or spend more than $5,000 specifically in support of a presidential campaign effort to officially register as a presidential candidate, according to Federal Election Commission guidelines. Even though Trump has conducted campaign-style political rallies and raised tens of millions of dollars for his collection of post-presidential political committees — most notably, Save America PAC — he hasn't expressly declared that these committees exist in service to his presidential ambitions. ""If he starts to spend money pursuing a run for office, that could trigger candidacy,"" Ken Gross, former associate general counsel of the FEC, wrote in an email to Insider. ""Making such a statement on a golf course, possibly in jest, about becoming the 47th president doesn't quite get you there."" While many election experts say the golf course comment is not enough to force Trump to register as an official presidential candidate, some have warned that if he keeps making these comments, his own mouth could force his hand to decide on whether he will register. ""This was just an offhand comment …But if Trump were to make more statements like that, especially in a public forum, then it becomes more likely that he would cross the threshold into a candidate status,"" said Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at Campaign Legal Center. Ann Ravel, another former FEC chairwoman who now lectures at Berkeley Law, wrote to Insider that Trump is already getting close to the blurry line between candidate and non-candidate. ""This appears to be a decision to run, since he did not qualify it by saying 'if I run' — but stated that he planned to be the 47th President. So if he starts raising money, he must register as a candidate to disclose all his expenditures and contributions,"" Ravel said. Matt Mackowiak, a Texas-based Republican strategist, previously told Insider that Trump might be holding off his announcement to run for office for many reasons, including pending legal investigations, financial concerns, and health reasons. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Insider on Wednesday, ""Well, I think that if he's healthy, he will."" ""If he wants to run, he will be the nominee, in my judgment,"" Gingrich said. ""And the odds are pretty good he'll win."" Trump is still a favorite among potential 2024 Republican presidential candidates. Fifty-seven percent of Republican voters supported him to lead the GOP presidential ticket, according to a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll shared with The Hill.  Trump's recent comments hinting at another run for office come at a crucial time while Trump is aggressively fundraising for the Republican Party and his own PACs. Save America, Trump's flagship political action committee, had more than $90 million in reserve as of June 30, latest FEC filings show. Trump is also the animating force behind the Make America Great Again Action super PAC, which may raise and spend unlimited sums of money. Trump can personally use so long as he's not a declared candidate. The former president is expected to appear in Houston to attend the ""Save America"" rally over the weekend. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Ken Paxton are also expected to make an appearance and speak at the event, according to the Houston Chronicle. Election experts told Insider that there are financial benefits to Trump holding off his announcement to run for office. ""Before he becomes a candidate, he can be more involved with the operation of the super PAC. Once he becomes a candidate, then he can only raise and spend money,"" Fisher said. Presidential campaign committees are also subject to fundraising restrictions that other kinds of political committees — particularly super PACs — are not. For example, an individual donor can contribute a maximum of $5,800 to a single presidential campaign — $2,900 toward the primary, $2,900 toward a general election. The same donor could give more to a PAC or a party committee — and give any amount they want to a super PAC. Eliza Relman and Jake Lahut contributed to this reporting.

1/29/2022,"Trevor Noah clapped back at Joe Rogan after he claimed in a podcast segment that only “100 percent African” people should be called Black. On Tuesday’s episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, Rogan offered his thoughts (as a very white man) on what it means to be Black to podcast guest professor Jordan Peterson, reported Newsweek. He questioned why people ‘his color’ identified as Black and Peterson referred to himself as not really white but ‘tan.’
 “There’s such a spectrum of shades of people. Unless you’re talking to someone who is, like, 100 percent African, from the darkest place, where they are not wearing any clothes all day and they’ve developed all that melanin to protect themselves from the sun, you know, even the term Black is weird. When you use it for people who are literally my color, it becomes very strange,” said Rogan via Newsweek.

 From Newsweek:
 After playing a clip of the exchange, Noah looked at his hands in feigned shock as he quipped: “Oh my God! I’m not Black! I’m not Black! Joe Rogan’s right! I’m like a Caramel Mocha Frappuccino. This changes everything. This changes everything!” He then ran off screen, prompting the sound of police sirens to play on the set. Returning to his desk, Noah then informed his audience: “The police said I’m Black. But yeah, apparently Joe Rogan really wants to know why they say ‘Black people’ if they’re not the color of a Sharpie.” Noah also reminded Rogan and the audience that Black people did not call themselves Black, initially. White people did not arrive in Africa with interest in differentiating between tribes. “But then white people got there, and they were like, ‘Wow. There’s a lot of Black people here. A lot of Black people.’ Then in America, they invented a rule that if you had one drop of Black blood in you, that makes you Black—which defined how you were treated by the government and by society,” said Noah, via Newsweek.
 Previous podcast guest professor Michael Eric Dyson called professor Peterson an ‘angry white man’ to which Peterson responded he was not white but actually ‘tan.’ Dyson addressed Rogan and Peterson in an CNN interview with Don Lemon, reported Newsweek. From Newsweek: Stating that it represented a wider issue, Dyson went on: “This is the same kind of ignorance that fuels the belief that [critical race theory] is being taught in elementary schools. “This is the same kind of ignorance that would have us believe that 1619 is anti-democratic, anti-American project. This is the nature of the whiteness we continually confront. This is willful ignorance. Well, that explains why white Twitter was up in arms over Spotify choosing to give Rogan a podcast over keeping Neil Young’s music catalogue. Anyways, someone save us from this podcast movement.

1/29/2022,"For the first time this year, millions of Americans may qualify for a particularly generous tax break — the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) — thanks to an expansion of its eligibility requirements. ""There are important changes to EITC that will help this credit reach more hard-working families this year,"" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. ""We urge people potentially eligible for this valuable credit to review the guidelines; many people each year overlook this and leave money on the table."" Historically without the expansion, 1 in 5 eligible Americans don’t claim the EITC, prompting the Internal Revenue Service to hold an EITC Awareness Day each year — this year on January 28 — to make sure taxpayers don’t miss out. If your marital status changed, you’re a member of the armed forces, disabled, living in a rural area, a grandparent raising a grandchild, or Native American, you may be eligible for this credit. More workers without children can also qualify for the EITC due to income threshold increases, filing status, and the lookback election. Here’s what you should know. In the past, the EITC for those with no dependents was only available to people ages 25 to 64. Not for the 2021 tax year. Single filers without qualifying children who are at least 19 years old with income below $21,430 and joint filers with no children and income below $27,380 will now qualify for the credit. There is also no upper age limit for claiming the credit if you have earned income. The maximum EITC for these filers is also better — $1,502 from $538 in 2020. “If you filed last year and your income was just above the limit to claim this credit, know that the income threshold has increased,” Manuel Dominguez, a senior tax research analyst at H&R Block, said in a webinar hosted by the National Consumers League (NCL). “And you may now be eligible for this credit this year.“ The income threshold also increased for married filing jointly who have children. In 2020, the income threshold was $56,844 with a maximum credit of $6,660, while this year, the income max is $57,414 with a maximum credit of $6,728. “If your income in 2019 is higher than your income in 2021, [the lookback election] …using that 2019 income allows you to claim a higher earned income tax credit,” Dominguez said. To take advantage of this election, taxpayers must have earned income through employment or other sources. The lookback election helps workers get a larger credit if they earned less in 2021 or received unemployment income instead of their regular wages. Certain changes to the law expand the EITC for the 2021 tax year as well as future years.  In previous years, the credit wasn’t available for married filing separately. This year and going forward, those who file married separately can claim the credit if they meet other qualifications. Those with investment income up to $10,000 can get the credit. In 2020, the limit was $3,650. In future tax years, the limit will adjust for inflation. Last, filers with children can claim the credit even if their children don't have Social Security numbers. As long as the filers themselves have a Social Security credit, they qualify for the credit. In the past, they didn't. If your refund is based partially or fully on the EITC, by law, the IRS cannot issue those refund payments until mid-February — even if your refund includes other credits not related to the EITC. This delay is to prevent fraud and errors. For the earliest filers, the IRS expects refunds to be in filers' bank accounts or on debit cards by the first week of March.  Taxpayers can track their refund using the agency's Where’s My Refund? tool online at IRS.gov or on the IRS2Go app. Those tools will provide information for the earliest EITC refunds by February 19.
