3/17/2022,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has upended the farming industry, raising fears of disruption to domestic and international food supplies. The Guardian has spoken to three farmers about what life is like on the ground, including the Russian army hiding tanks in barns and stocks of potatoes expected to deplete within weeks. Andrii Pastushenko, 39, is a dairy farmer who lives 20km away from Kherson in the south of Ukraine, a city that has been under control of the Russian military. On Monday, 10 Russian soldiers came and set up a base on the farm, leaving their tanks in barns, with more soldiers arriving later. But after overnight shelling by Ukraine’s military at Kherson airport, the Russian troops left on Wednesday morning. “They quickly packed up this morning, taking two cars and food from the farm and saying they were ‘nationalising’ them,” he said, adding that they did not pay for either but said “See you soon”. The 350-cow dairy farm had been selling milk to the French dairy processor Lactalis, which has a presence in Ukraine. Since the war started, Pastushenko’s staff have been making butter, quark and cream, and distributing it to local villages and families. They have also been turning grain supplies into porridge and slaughtering cows to provide meat for the 70 farm workers on the site as well as local residents. “Right now everyone stays on the farm and keeps working,” said Pastushenko, who remains there with his 15-year-old son. His wife has moved to the city of Zhytomyr, 150km west of Kyiv, with their younger son. “In the first five days of the war, a milk truck came from Kherson and picked up milk and delivered it to all the city’s hospitals before distributing the leftovers to the local people. Now we have someone in every village who comes to the farm and picks up milk and food then distributes it, with the help of the churches,” he said. Pastushenko says they are running out of feed for the cows and, with Russian soldiers in the area, he does not know if they will be able to plant crops or harvest silage for the cows to eat. “I can’t leave. I can’t take my son away. We are trapped here. If I leave, the hungry people will steal and slaughter the cows and other animals. We do that already, but only one cow every two days because we need meat for my employees and the rest of us,” he said. Other livestock farmers in the country have also spoken of their inability to get meat or animals off their farms and on to processors to distribute to the wider population. Kees Huizinga has a 2,000-cow dairy herd and a 450-sow pig farm near Cherkasy, 200km south of Kyiv. Although there are no Russian soldiers in his area at present, he said he had lost a number of staff to military service. Milk from the farm is still being collected by a milk processor, who sells it in western Ukraine where there is high demand from refugees who have moved there from other parts of the country. But Huizinga’s pigs are mostly being slaughtered on the farm now and used by the army and locals. “It’s pretty primitive, but we have no choice,” he said. One farmer who co-manages a 2,000-hectare (4,940-acre) arable farm near the city of Lviv in western Ukraine grows potatoes and protein crops including soya beans. The farm is a major supplier of potatoes to domestic markets, with a new crop due to be planted within the next few weeks. His farm supplies potatoes from storage to the Ukrainian military and refugees, but he said he only has about four to five weeks of supply left. He says growers in the country have critical decisions to make in the next fortnight about what spring crops to grow this year, with shortages of fuel, fertiliser and pesticides. “There is a desire from the Ukrainian government that the crop is planted. We will scale back slightly here, but do plan to plant. However, we need help particularly in terms of crop-protection supplies to protect our potatoes from diseases such as late blight that can devastate crops.” The farmer, who has been based outside Ukraine for the past few years but communicates daily with staff on site, says the farm is currently free from Russian military interference but that he is worried about the safety of his staff. “Things have escalated here this week,” he said.",News/Environment,‘Russian soldiers took over my farm’: the battle for food supplies in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/russian-soldiers-took-over-farm-battle-food-supplies-ukraine
3/17/2022,"The Imperial War Museum (IWM) has said it is retaining the funding it received from Roman Abramovich for its Holocaust Galleries, after consulting the UK government on the implications of sanctions. The oligarch was disqualified last week by the Premier League from being a Chelsea director after sanctions imposed on him following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The IWM announced in 2018 that Abramovich, who is Jewish, had made a “generous contribution” to enable its London museum to realise a £30.5m project to create second world war galleries, a Holocaust gallery and a digitally enabled learning suite. IWM told the Guardian on Wednesday: “IWM is retaining the funds from Roman Abramovich, which were invested into the Holocaust Galleries at IWM London. This is compliant with all government regulations regarding sanctions.” Asked how much Abramovich had provided, a spokesperson said: “As this was a private donation, IWM is not disclosing the amount donated by Mr Abramovich to the new galleries.” The new galleries opened last year at the IWM, which became the first museum in the world to house second world war and holocaust galleries under the same roof. Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial centre has meanwhile “suspended its strategic partnership” with Abramovich, who was granted Israeli citizenship in 2018. Jewish groups earlier this month condemned a Russian missile attack near a Holocaust memorial park in Kyiv, which commemorates the murder of Jews at Babyn Yar by Nazis in the second world war. At least five civilians were reportedly killed in the missile attack. Abramovich was seen at the Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday, shortly before a jet linked to him took off for Istanbul. The sanctions against him – brought in years after campaigners first raised concerns about his ties to the Russian president – have come amid a wider western crackdown on the country’s wealthy business elite. Abramovich was among several Russian billionaires added to an EU blacklist before he was put on a British sanctions list last week. Portugal’s foreign minister, Augusto Santos Silva, said on Wednesday that the country would implement EU sanctions against Abramovich but could not ban him entering the country because he was a citizen there. The billionaire was granted Portuguese citizenship last year based on the 2015 law, which the Portuguese government said it was now tightening, that offers naturalisation to descendants of Sephardic Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula during the medieval Inquisition. The Premier League’s decision last week to bar Abramovich from being a director of Chelsea in effect forced him to push ahead with his sale of the club.",News/World news,Holocaust Galleries in London to keep donation from Roman Abramovich,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/holocaust-galleries-in-london-to-keep-donation-from-roman-abramovich
3/17/2022,"Eddie Howe has always harboured an obstinate streak. During his time in charge of Bournemouth he arranged an 8am press conference on Christmas Day and was unconcerned that it might make him unpopular or appear emotionally unintelligent. In a very different, rather more important, context, Newcastle’s manager reprised that ability to dig his heels in and resist people-pleasing after his side’s 1-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge last Sunday. Given Howe’s club are Saudi Arabian-controlled and the Gulf Kingdom had just executed 81 men, he knew he would be questioned about Riyadh’s woeful human rights record. Howe accepted his refusal to answer such inquiries would prompt suggestions he was complicit in sportswashing but decided that being dubbed an ignorant puppet was preferable to navigating a geopolitical minefield and duly stonewalled a barrage of questions related to human rights. On Wednesday Newcastle’s manager was unapologetic as he explained his stance to a slightly more sympathetic media audience in a small room at the training ground and revealed he was conducting characteristically detailed research into the finer points of Saudi politics, history and culture. “It’s not uncomfortable to be asked about geopolitics,” he said. “I understand you have to ask and I’ve no problem with that but it’s my right to answer in the way I feel is best for me and for Newcastle United. We’ve got a game at Everton tomorrow and all my energy has to be directed towards that; otherwise the team will suffer. “My specialist subject is football. It’s what I know and as soon as I deviate from that into an area where I don’t feel qualified to have a huge opinion I go into dangerous ground so, at the moment, I prefer to stick to what I believe I know.” It is safe to assume Howe is unlikely to start debating any time soon the nuances of Islam’s enduring Sunni and Shia rivalries and their role in Saudi’s contentious intervention against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen’s tragic civil war. Similarly do not expect him to follow the likely path of a perhaps more streetwise, media-savvy, manager and placate critics by condemning Jamal Khashoggi’s grisly murder or lamenting the lack of women’s rights in Saudi. “I’ve definitely read up on the subjects I’m being asked about and will continue to do so,” he said. “I’m job-obsessed and part of modern management now is to know what’s going on around the world.” Not that he is a stranger to international news. “I was a footballer with a slight difference,” said Howe. “I was 19 or 20 at Bournemouth going on to the team bus with The Times under my arm and getting some very strange looks from my teammates. I come from a family where these things were pushed on me and I was quite interested in world politics but now that I’m managing, free time is such a scarce resource. That’s not to say I don’t keep up to date but it’s something that’s gone out of my life slightly; I’ll have to dedicate more time to it.” Another manager might have reiterated Sir Bobby Robson’s view that football, and life, are “all about shades of grey” and reminded everyone the Saudis are pouring hundreds of millions of pounds into regeneration projects on Tyneside while also creating a professional women’s team. Howe though prefers to restrict nuance to the highly intelligent tactics steering Newcastle clear of relegation danger and, unsurprisingly, such tunnel vision characterised his decision to accept the St James’ Park posting. The 44-year-old is adamant geopolitics did not enter the equation. “I was looking at the stadium, the supporter base, the team,” he said. “That had to be my focus. “You meet the brilliant people behind the scenes – Amanda Staveley [a director and minority shareholder], Mehrdad [Ghodoussi, Staveley’s husband], Yasir [al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s chairman] – who I have a great relationship with. A lot of trust’s been built between us. And, of course, Newcastle’s owned by people [Saudi’s Public Investment Fund] who the Premier League have allowed to own a football club. From my side, that’s as far as it went. “I’ve since reviewed my decision based on the people I’ve met and I’m very proud to manage this club. It’s a very special place. I’m hugely proud to represent this club, the supporters and the city.” Surely Staveley and Rumayyan should be answering Saudi-related questions? “I’ve had discussions with them on various things,” said Howe, who is taking Newcastle to a training camp in Dubai after facing Everton. “Would I like them to come out and talk about politics? No; they’ll do what they think’s right.” Perhaps typically, he feels certain ethical debates are best left outside the dressing-room door. “I’ve not had any political discussions with my players,” he said. “That’s not to say I wouldn’t have them or would discourage them but, if I’m going into a team meeting, I’m going to discuss how to improve defending at the back post or one-v-one duels. Football has to be our No 1 focus. Playing in the Premier League is difficult enough without any other thoughts. “Players educating themselves on all areas of the world is a positive thing; I’ve got no issue with it – but my players need to be focused on playing football.”",Sport/Football,Howe maintains tunnel vision amid Newcastle human rights questions,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/eddie-howe-tunnel-vision-newcastle-human-rights-questions
3/17/2022,"Did Boris Johnson feel a flicker of alarm when the news broke that Saudi Arabia had executed 81 men just days before his in trip to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? The prime minister is not famed for being a man of conscience, but he has a solid grasp of optics. He surely knows that shaking hands with an autocrat who has just overseen a mass killing will harm Britain’s moral standing on the global stage, at a time when this could not be more important. Since Jamal Khashoggi was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 and murdered, western leaders have mostly stayed away from the kingdom and avoided photo ops with the crown prince. But in the weeks since Russian troops invaded Ukraine, there is a sense the calculus has shifted. Increasingly, Conservative ministers and their media outriders are saying the government should do whatever it takes to lessen Britain’s dependence on Russian gas – that it should “make a pact with the devil,” as Crisis Research Institute director, Mark Almond, put it in the Daily Mail. The timing of the executions is chilling. Less than a fortnight ago, the Atlantic published a lengthy interview with the crown prince touting sweeping modernisations of the Saudi criminal justice system. Staging the largest mass execution in the country’s history so soon after this claim seems a gangster-ish display of impunity: What are you gonna do about it? he seems to ask. The answer appears to be: not much. By visiting Saudi Arabia this week, Johnson will all but confirm that the Saudi authorities can kill whomever they want, whenever and however, and the west will ignore it. It virtually guarantees that more people whose only crime was to challenge the status quo will be executed. People like Hassan al-Maliki, a religious scholar currently facing a death sentence for the contents of his library. The 81 executions at the weekend were probably beheadings, but Saudi “justice” is such a black box we can never be sure. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights (ESOHR), which keeps a comprehensive record of death sentences in Saudi Arabia, didn’t even know about 69 of the cases. These men were tried, convicted, sentenced and executed in complete secrecy. Of the 12 we do know about, at least three were likely tortured into making false confessions to terrorism offences after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Aqil al-Faraj, from a prominent dissident family in Qatif, was held in solitary confinement and reportedly beaten all over his body and tortured with electricity and cigarette burns. He was imprisoned for five years, without access to a lawyer, before trial. United Nations special rapporteurs wrote to the Saudi authorities about the cases of Mohammed al-Shakhouri and Asaad Shubbar, expressing concern at their unfair trials, the prosecution’s reliance on torture confessions, and the fact that they may have been targeted as members of a religious minority. This is the reality of Saudi capital punishment. The authorities label executed men “terrorists”, but there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders and people arrested as children on death row. Abdullah al-Howaiti, who was 14 when he was tortured into confessing to a crime he cannot have committed, has just been sentenced to death for a second time. In 2014, the UK and Saudi governments signed a “memorandum of understanding” on judicial cooperation. My organisation, Reprieve, made a freedom of information request for the document – but it was refused on the grounds that to publish the information might have a “negative impact on the effective conduct of international relations”. Because of this secrecy, we have no idea if UK assistance has supported a judicial regime that relies on torture and executions in Saudi Arabia. What we do know from ESOHR reports and media monitoring is that in the period this agreement has been in place, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has dramatically increased the pace of executions – there have now been more than 900 since 2015. Just this January, the UK justice minister, Dominic Raab, met with his counterpart, Sheikh Walid al-Samaani, and said he was “glad to hear about Saudi Arabia’s progress” on judicial reform and human rights. He was taken for a fool. The prime minister’s trip to Riyadh, so soon after this mass execution, shames him personally and shames Britain. Will nobody in his inner circle tell him that there are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than emboldening and empowering a murderous regime? On Monday, MPs and peers of all parties condemned the massacre in the strongest possible terms and questioned the government’s reluctance to do the same. We must not show our revulsion for Vladimir Putin’s atrocities by rewarding those of Mohammed bin Salman.

3/17/2022,"UK intelligence services who allegedly asked the CIA to put questions to a detainee who was being tortured in “black sites” were subject to the law of England and Wales and not that of the countries in which he was being held, the court of appeal has ruled. The three appeal judges were asked to decide whether Abu Zubaydah, who was subjected to extreme mistreatment and torture at secret CIA “black sites” in six different countries, has the right to sue the UK government in England. At the high court last year, Mr Justice Lane had ruled that the applicable law was the law of the various places where the claimant’s ill-treatment occurred, namely Thailand, Lithuania, Poland, Afghanistan, Morocco and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. But on Wednesday Lord Justice Males, Lady Justice Thirlwall and Dame Victoria Sharp unanimously allowed the appeal. In Males’s written judgment, he said: “These are strong connections connecting the tortious conduct with England and Wales. They reflect also the parties’ reasonable expectations. While it is true that the claimant himself had no connection with this country, he could reasonably have expected, if he had thought about it during the 20 years in which he has been detained, that the conduct of any country’s security services having to do with him would be governed by the law of the country concerned. As for the services, they would reasonably have expected that their conduct here would be subject to English law.” Males also said: Zubaydah had no control whatever over his location and in all probability no knowledge of it either. His location was irrelevant to the UK intelligence services and may have been unknown to them. The claimant was undoubtedly rendered to the six countries in question precisely because this would enable him to be detained and tortured outside the laws and legal systems of those countries. Zubaydah claims that MI5 and MI6 committed the torts of misfeasance in public office, conspiracy to injure, trespass to the person, false imprisonment and negligence and that the defendants – the UK Foreign Office, Home Office and attorney general – are vicariously liable for their conduct. The claimant, whose full name is Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, was captured in March 2002 in Pakistan. He says that between 2002 and 2006 he was unlawfully rendered by agents of the United States to the six countries named and then in 2006 he was rendered again to Guantánamo Bay, where he has been held without trial ever since. Zubaydah alleges that the UK intelligence services sent numerous questions to the CIA, to be used in interrogations of him for the purpose of attempting to elicit information of interest to them and without seeking any assurances that he would not be tortured or mistreated or taking steps to discourage or prevent such treatment. He says that at the black sites he was subjected to torture and mistreatment, including waterboarding on 83 occasions, extreme sleep deprivation, confinement inside boxes, beatings, death threats, starvation, denial of medical care and no access to sanitation. The defendants have not pleaded to allegations made against the US authorities but Males said “there is unlikely to be any serious dispute about the fact of the claimant’s rendition to the various countries listed above, his detention at CIA ‘black sites’, and that he was subject to treatment in those countries at the hands of the CIA which, in this jurisdiction, would be regarded as torture.”",News/Law,"UK spies who allegedly passed questions to CIA torturers subject to English law, court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/16/abu-zubaydah-uk-spies-cia-torture-english-law
3/17/2022,"A Wisconsin dentist was found guilty of healthcare fraud and other charges after he intentionally damaged his patients’ teeth to boost profits, raking in millions from his scheme. Scott Charmoli, 61, was convicted of five counts of healthcare fraud and two counts of making false claims about his clients’ treatment last Thursday, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. With his sentencing scheduled for June, Charmoli faces up to 10 years for each healthcare fraud charge and a maximum of five years for each of the two other charges. Prosecutors say that Charmoli had routinely drilled or broken his clients’ teeth on purpose, charging them for additional treatment services to fix the damage he had just done. As a result, Charmoli’s profits ballooned, with the dentist going from making $1.4m and installing 434 crowns in 2014 to $2.5m in 2015, installing over 1,000 crowns, reported the Washington Post. According to prosecutors, in 2015, Charmoli began pressuring his clients into getting unnecessary crowns, a dental procedure where a tooth-shaped cap is placed on a damaged tooth. Charmoli would drill or break his client’s teeth and send X-rays of the intentional damage to insurance as “before” photos to justify the crown procedures. One client, Todd Tedeschi, testified that Charmoli pressured him into getting two crowns in one appointment, despite Tedeschi believing that his teeth were fine. “It seemed excessive, but I didn’t know any better,” said Tedeschi. “He was the professional. I just trusted him.” Some of the patients that Charmoli badgered into unnecessary procedures were also vulnerable, said prosecutors. “Some of these patients were extremely vulnerable individuals in abusive relationships, recently widowed, survivors of cancer and living paycheck to paycheck scrounging to afford the co-pays required for the unnecessary procedures he was billing,” said prosecutor Julie Stewart in 2020. Between 2016 to 2019, Charmoli billed more than $4.2m for crowns, performing more crowns than 95% of dentists in Wisconsin during that time. According to testimony from an insurance company executive, while an average Wisconsin dentist performs fewer than six crowns for every 100 patients, Charmoli’s rate exceeded more than 32 crowns per 100 clients. By the end of 2020, Charmoli had over $6.8m worth of assets, with vacation homes in Wisconsin and Arizona. Nearly 100 of Charmoli’s former patients have sued him for medical malpractice, with those cases set to begin once Charmoli’s federal criminal proceedings are over. While Charmoli’s lawyers did not provide comment to the Post following Charmoli’s conviction, his lawyers commented during Charmoli’s December 2020 arraignment, where the dentist pleaded not guilty, saying Charmoli was only guilty of “hard work”. “He certainly denies that his hard-earned wealth of many, many years of dental practice at the 40 to 60 hour per week range are the product of anything other than his own diligence, hard work and good business acumen,” said defense attorney Nila Robinson at the time. Charmoli’s schemes were eventually unearthed when he sold his dental practice in 2019. While reviewing his files, the new owners noted the high rate of crown procedures Charmoli had done and reported him to the authorities. “The health and safety of patients is my highest concern as a doctor. As medical professionals, we take an oath to ‘do no harm’ to our patients, which is why I felt the ethical obligation to report activity that I believed to be suspicious,” wrote the Jackson Family Dentistry owner Pako Major on the practice’s website. Wisconsin state authorities suspended Charmoli’s dental license in February 2021, pending disciplinary action. Charmoli was first licensed in 1986.",News/US news, Dentist found guilty of damaging patients’ teeth to boost profits,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/wisconsin-dentist-guilty-damaging-patients-teeth-boost-profits
3/17/2022,"Blerta Basholli’s award-winning debut feature is a film about honey and also about ajvar, a sweet dish from the former Yugoslavia made from aubergines and red peppers. But the film tastes fierce and sharp, like black coffee. It is based on the true story of Fahrije Hoti, a Kosovan woman whose husband went missing during the Balkan wars of the 90s, and so just to stay alive and provide for her children, she formed a women-only collective with all the other war widows (or presumed widows, longing for definitive news of what Serb forces did with their missing husbands) making honey and other delicacies to sell. But the film shows her facing brutal misogyny and violence from the men in her village who feel she is getting above herself. (The drama comes with a closing disclaimer emphasising that some of it is fictional, I suspect to pre-empt lawsuits.) Albanian-born Kosovan actress Yllka Gashi is excellent as Fahrije herself, a woman who started this business at least partly to manage or exorcise her grief: the hive in their garden was set up by her husband. This is her way of staying close to his memory; she remembers how instinctive his touch was with the bees and how he never got stung. Fahrije, on the other hand, is always getting stung, and this is partly why she switches largely to ajvar; each sting is a reminder. There is a marvellous scene in which Fahrije’s young son is thoughtfully combing his hair in front of the mirror, with some adolescent stirrings of vanity, perhaps. Watching him, Fahrije suddenly smiles, with transparent love and pain, and without needing to be told we can see she thinks he resembles his father. Her own father-in-law Haxhi (a great performance from veteran Kosovan actor and musician Çun Lajçi) is a glowering figure, dealing with agony and grief in his own way, but gradually coming to value Fahrije. This is a richly intelligent drama, in which every word and every shot counts.

3/17/2022,"Remember that night in Paris? This same March week back in 2016, Eddie Jones’s England went there with the grand slam on the line. Of course they won it, beating France 31-21 thanks to fine tries from Danny Care, Dan Cole and Anthony Watson. Afterwards, James Haskell and Chris Robshaw were walking around the Stade de France in custom-made shirts with the number six-and-a-half on the back (a sly and affectionate dig at their coach after he told them they couldn’t play seven), while the Vunipola brothers belted out Backstreet Boys covers in the dressing room. It was the start of a party that stretched long into the next morning. Looking back, it is still the happiest night the team have had since Jones took over. In that first year or so, he approached England’s rugby like a breeze blowing away fog. His ruthlessness made for a stark contrast with the muddled thinking his predecessor, Stuart Lancaster, had got bogged down in during the last year of his tenure as head coach. Lancaster and his assistant coaches were still trying to figure out who was in their best XV after they had been knocked out of the 2015 World Cup. They were going back and forth over who should start at fly-half and in the midfield for that last, dead pool game against Uruguay. Jones thought George Ford was his best fly-half so picked him there, he wanted Owen Farrell in his team, too, so he put him at centre. He didn’t believe Robshaw was the right man to play on the open-side so he moved him and brought back Haskell. He didn’t think Robshaw was the right man to be captain either; he wanted what he called a bit more “mongrel”, so recalled Dylan Hartley. He had clear ideas about the team’s style of play and strategy. He wanted what he called a traditionally English approach, with an emphasis on a strong set piece. He stopped England from worrying about anything apart from winning the next game. Jones had the knack of making a complicated game simple. Read back his assessment of Lancaster’s mistakes in one of his last columns for the Daily Mail: “They went away from what they had practised for most of the year and that breeds confusion amongst the players. If you don’t have clarity, you have a problem. “Yes, they had an injury to Jonathan Joseph but they should have had someone similar to fill his shoes. You need a second-string guy who can play the same way, without having to change the direction of the whole team. They switched it all around again at half-time against Australia and everything just looked a little bit confused.” It was crisp, clear and grounded in simple principles. You wonder what that Eddie Jones would make of this Eddie Jones and what would he say about England now if he still had that column in the Mail. Would he ask why the captaincy is being passed around between Tom Curry, Courtney Lawes and Farrell when the man who sets the standards, Maro Itoje, is frozen out because he may or may not (it depends if you go on Jones’s last book or what he said about it afterwards) be too “inward-looking” to do it? Would he ask why if England’s forwards played so well against Ireland when Itoje and Lawes were packing down together at lock England don’t play them there every week? Would he wonder why if England still want to build a midfield around the mighty Manu Tuilagi when he is fit, they’ve also been picking the radically different midfield pairing of Henry Slade and Elliot Daly when he’s not? Would he look through all the players who have been discarded over the years because they had the wrong attitude and decide that two or three or four or more of them (Billy Vunipola, say, or Ollie Lawrence), could, just like Hartley and Haskell, still do a job if the coach only had a different approach to his man-management? Would he question why Max Malins has been binned from this last match against France after playing every minute of the tournament? Would he look at this England team and wonder what style of rugby they are supposed to be playing? Would he ask what their defining characteristics are? Would he wonder why, after finishing fifth in the Six Nations last year and getting stuck in mid-table again this, England seem to have moved so far away from that first principle of winning the next game and why there is so much talk about work in progress and what they’ll be doing this time next year? Jones would say the decisions he made then, and the way he had the team playing in that first year, were the product of a particular time and place, when he was fresh to the job and the players were driven by the make amends for their awful performance in the World Cup. Last year he decided many of the players who got to the World Cup final in 2019 had lost that drive and he needed to rebuild the team, work he’s still at. But it’s beginning to feel like England are living on the promise of what they’ll do tomorrow. Or the year after. Supporting them has become a question of faith that they’ll come right when it counts most. “I have always seen trust as a bank where you make deposits and withdrawals,” Jones has said. “You’ve got to avoid making too many withdrawals and concentrate on building your deposits.” He has drawn a lot in the past few weeks. There’s still credit there. They paid some back against Ireland last Saturday. But they still lost and he, and his team, could sure use another top-up in Paris on Saturday.",Sport/Sport,What would the old Eddie Jones say about today's Eddie Jones and England? | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/16/what-would-old-eddie-jones-say-england-rugby-union
3/17/2022,"And so the boys are back in town. Michael, Trevor and Franklin, the sociopathic trio that lit up the gaming scene nine years ago, have been made over for the 2020s with this crisp new reworking of Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The game’s violent narrative of shifting loyalties and doomed machismo felt wild and edgy back in 2013, so how does it fare in the modern era? The good news is, the overhauled visuals definitely give the game new zest and freshness. You can play in either 4K at 30 frames-per-second or in a performance mode that lowers the resolution but bumps up the frame rate to 60, giving wonderful fluidity to car chases, swooping helicopter rides and mass shootouts. The DualSense controller features on PlayStation 5 are very good too: improved driving feedback via the analogue triggers makes the game’s cumbersome handling a little easier to, well, handle. It’s been quite a joy to rediscover this alternate-reality California; to see the sun drop behind the downtown skyscrapers, or to hit Senora as dawn splashes orange-yellow light across the burning desert. What the vast upshift in resolution can’t hide is the fact that GTA V is a game originally designed for consoles that are now two generations out of date. The character models and facial details look positively archaic compared with, say, Horizon Forbidden West, and the building architecture too seems almost quaint in its stylised blockiness. Compare it with 2018’s Red Dead Redemption 2 and you can see just how far Rockstar has come in its building of intricate next-gen worlds. In many ways, however, the design of the world itself has not been been bettered in the decade since it arrived. The size of San Andreas, the sheer variety of landscapes and the diversity of actions and activities is still incredible – Cyberpunk 2077 may look better, but it doesn’t let you play golf or tennis, or go on day trips on a bike, or set up incredibly complex car or helicopter stunts. Los Santos is a vast playground, a gangster Fortnite – a factor underlined by the massive community that still gathers in GTA Online (which is where we find this new version’s only totally new content – Hao’s Special Works, which lets you unlock faster cars and new tasks). Less showy, but no less important is the fact that everything runs faster. The interminable load times of the original game have been considerably reduced and GTA Online is now accessible from the start, with a much better opening few hours that teach you as you go. So is it worth buying? If you’ve never owned GTA V before (perhaps unlikely, given its insane sales figures) then yes, definitely – the game is a crazy, irresponsible, messed-up experience with awesome set-piece moments alongside its bloodstained sacks of problematic content. Weirdly, the subtle-as-a-Trident-missile satire on contemporary culture, featuring conspiracy-laden rightwing news channels and dudebro billionaires, still feels relevant, even if it was made in the pre-Trump, pre-TikTok, pre-crypto era. If you played it back in the day, but want to test your new console’s technical capabilities or try all the stuff that’s been added to GTA Online, then it’s certainly worth a look. Sadly, you can’t play cross-platform or cross-generation (although you can import your saves from previous editions), so you’re going to have to rely on friends also forking out for the new version if you want to get together for a few heists (which are, as ever, a blast). In 2022, GTA V is something of an ageing prize fighter: sleek and brutal, but with aches and wrinkles that just can’t be ignored. Whatever the case, it remains a landmark game – at once flawed, repulsive, incredible and hilarious. To be cruising these streets again, the radio blasting, the neon shimmering, is to be reminded of how this series shook up the whole idea of what it means to exist inside a game. It is still king, even if the crown is now weighing heavy.",Arts/Games,GTA V is back for a new generation – how will it fare in the 2020s?,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/16/gta-v-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-rockstar
3/17/2022,"The government has proposed to set air quality limits that would allow twice as much small-particle pollution in England as the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends as an upper limit, and that would not be met for almost 20 years. The new target is to reduce levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, to 10 micrograms per cubic metre by 2040, in contrast to WHO guidelines, updated last September, that say concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic metre on average over a year. The government said the proposal would reduce exposure to fine particulates – the air pollutant most harmful to human health – by more than a third compared with 2018 levels in England. However, campaigners said the measure was inadequate and would continue to leave millions of people exposed to dangerously dirty air. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter, Ella, died of air pollution in 2013, told the Guardian: “It is appalling. It is so disappointing. The government is not taking this seriously, as a public health crisis. They are completely disregarding what the coroner said [in the case of Ella’s death], that no child should suffer and die like my daughter.” Requirements to clean up England’s rivers have also been dropped, in a range of new proposals set out on Wednesday under the Environment Act, which was passed last year and requires ministers to set out legally binding targets on air quality, water, waste and biodiversity. In addition to the air pollution targets for England, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it would: Reduce nutrient pollution in water in England, with phosphorus in treated sewage to be cut by 80% by 2037, and nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment from agriculture to be reduced by 40% by 2037. Halt the decline in species by 2030 and increase species abundance by 10% by 2042, creating or restoring more than 500,000 hectares of wildlife-rich habitat outside protected sites by 2042. Halve residual waste produced by 2042, from 560kg per person in 2019; Improve the marine environment by ensuring 70% of “designated features” in marine-protected areas are in favourable condition by 2042. Increase tree canopy and woodland cover from 14% of England to 17.5% by 2050. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said: “These proposed targets are intended to set a clear, long-term plan for nature’s recovery. In a post-EU era we now have the freedom to move towards a system that focuses on nature’s recovery, as well as its preservation, and which places more emphasis on science and less emphasis on legal process. The change in approach will help us in the pursuit of the targets we are setting under the Environment Act.” Campaigners said the air and water quality measures, in particular, fell far short of what was needed. The government will now consult on the targets, with a view to making them legally binding towards the end of this year. Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Legally binding targets are urgently needed to clean up Britain’s dirty air. But these proposals are too weak, too slow, and fall a long way short of WHO guidelines. Strong action is essential to end the air pollution scandal that causes tens of thousands of premature deaths every year.” After public outcry over the high volumes of sewage that water companies are pouring into UK rivers, first revealed by a Guardian investigation, the government had been expected to put in place more stringent requirements on water quality. However, plans for a target for all English rivers to be in good health were dropped and the new proposals only cover limited forms of pollution, from agriculture and in sewage treatment. Richard Benwell, the chief executive of the charity Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “It’s right to set stringent targets to reduce pollution from particular sectors, but doing that while neglecting to set a long-term target for the actual quality of our water is totally topsy-turvy. The targets proposed for farmers and water companies miss major sources of pollution, and they’re measured on the basis of modelling. All this adds up to a situation where, in future, water targets could apparently be met while the real state of our rivers continues to decline.” Ruth Chambers, of the Greener UK coalition, added: “The targets on offer are a decent start, but it’s hard to see them making the necessary changes at the necessary speed. Genuine ambition would see targets for protected habitats and resource consumption, and with shorter deadlines. We cannot wait 15 years or longer to see if there’s an improvement.” The government also set out a green paper on nature, affirming that the UK’s wildlife and natural environment should continue to be protected, with a target of 30% of the UK’s land to be conserved or managed in a way that prioritises nature by 2030. Some farmers have suggested that environmental targets should be eased amid rising food prices, which could increase further as a result of the war in Ukraine. Vicki Hird, the head of farming at the campaigning coalition Sustain, said: “The UK can’t hope to improve its food security if our soil and land is exhausted, water courses polluted and nature depleted. Biodiversity is an essential part of our food system, so Sustain welcomes proposals for new legally binding targets to protect and nurture it. But farming is not finding an easy path to do this in an ever harsher market. “We urge the government to go further and faster in helping all farmers to embrace new nature-friendly, climate-boosting farming approaches, such as organic, agroforestry and diverse mixed farming and cropping, which can deliver healthy food alongside richer nature and carbon storage.”",News/Environment,Proposed air pollution limit in England is twice as high as WHO recommends,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/proposed-air-pollution-limit-england-environment-act

3/17/2022,"Most of Britain’s top companies now have at least one minority ethnic board member, the government-backed Parker review, set up to improve the diversity of UK boards, said on Wednesday. Improving boardroom diversity has become a hot topic for policymakers and investors in recent years, as many believe it helps address social inequalities and leads to better decision-making and performance over time. “Our December 2021 target of every FTSE 100 company having at least one board director from a minority ethnic background has very nearly been met,” said Sir John Parker, who chairs the committee. “We have also secured commitments from many of the outstanding companies which mean it is likely that circa 97% of current FTSE 100 companies will comply with the target by the middle of the year.” Last year, the number of FTSE 100 companies to meet the voluntary target rose to 89 from 74, and now a further five have done so. Three have committed to do so and are in the advanced stages of recruiting. Of the three companies yet to commit, the defence firm Meggitt is in the process of being acquired and will delist, and the Russian steel and mining company Evraz is about to exit the FTSE 100. The third is Dechra Pharmaceuticals. Among the FTSE 250 of medium-sized firms, 128 companies now meet the target ahead of an end-2024 deadline, it added. The targets for both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 were set in 2017. However, many companies are still failing to bring through diversity in executive roles, with only six FTSE 100 CEOs from a minority ethnic background, and 16 at companies on the FTSE 250. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “While there is still more to do, today’s findings demonstrate the great strides being made – particularly at FTSE 100 level – to increase ethnic diversity on boards, as more of Britain’s biggest companies recognise the business case for diversifying their teams so that they better reflect the society we live in.”",News/Business,Almost all UK’s top firms have at least one minority ethnic board member,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/almost-all-uks-top-firms-have-at-least-one-ethnic-minority-board-member
3/17/2022,"The insurance market Lloyd’s of London has issued the largest fine in its 336-year history after a member firm mishandled a bullying and harassment case and hosted an inappropriate “Boys’ Night Out” event for staff. Lloyd’s announced on Wednesday that it had fined Atrium Underwriters more than £1m due to “serious failures” by the firm, which was shown to have tolerated discrimination, harassment and bullying over a number of years. One of the charges related to “a systematic campaign of bullying” against a junior staffer by a male employee whose behaviour was well known at the firm, including by senior managers who failed to take adequate steps to address the problem. Atrium was also charged for “sanctioning and tolerating” an annual “Boys’ Night Out” where some male employees – including two senior executives – took part in inappropriate initiation games and heavy drinking, and made sexual comments about female colleagues that Lloyd’s said were both “discriminatory and harassing” to members of staff. “Some of this conduct was led, participated in and condoned by the two senior managers in attendance,” Lloyd’s said. The parties took place annually for a number of years until 2018. In relation to the bullying case, which took place during the same period, Atrium also failed to protect the junior staff member or the employee who complained. The employee was told to keep quiet about the case. Instead, Atrium negotiated a settlement package with the bullying employee and allowed him to resign rather than face any repercussions. Lloyd’s said this was done in part to avoid bad publicity that could harm the business, which employs about 205 staff. Atrium was subsequently charged for failing to notify Lloyd’s about the misconduct, which breached the insurance market’s bylaws. Lloyd’s enforcement board said the £1m fine, which is the largest it has ever imposed, reflected both “how unacceptable these circumstances were, and the seriousness with which Lloyd’s is treating this issue”. Atrium would have been fined £1.5m, but Lloyd’s slashed the penalty by nearly a third after the underwriter agreed to a settlement early on in the investigation. Atrium will also pay £562,713 to cover Lloyd’s administrative costs. Lloyd’s chief executive, John Neal, said: “We are deeply disappointed by the behaviour highlighted by this case and I want to be clear that discrimination, harassment and bullying have no place at Lloyd’s. The robust action we have taken today, including the largest fine ever imposed by the Lloyd’s enforcement board, shows that we will not tolerate poor conduct in our market.” The enforcement board said Atrium had previously had a “good disciplinary record” and had since updated its policies in regards to disciplinary issues, whistleblowing, diversity and inclusion, as well as training for senior managers. “Lloyd’s expects all participants in the market to meet the highest standards of professionalism and we are continuing to use our powers to intervene when needed,” Neal added. Atrium’s non-executive chairman, Christopher Stooke, apologised and said the underwriter accepted the insurance market’s ruling. “With deep regret, it is clear that Atrium failed to live up to its values and serious errors were made when handling these matters. We are sorry for the hurt that this caused and how difficult this been for those affected. “The behaviour outlined in the notice of censure has no place in our business or our industry, and we recognise that we must go further to ensure that this situation is never allowed to happen again.”",News/Business,Lloyd’s of London fines Atrium more than £1m for failing to tackle bullying,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/lloyds-largest-ever-fine-atrium-failing-tackle-bullying
