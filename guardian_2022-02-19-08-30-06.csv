2/19/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has angrily denied that Liverpool’s defeat of Internazionale showed he would have an advantage with five substitutes in the Premier League, and insisted attitude was key to winning at San Siro. The Liverpool manager’s 59th-minute introduction of Jordan Henderson, Luis Díaz and Naby Keïta helped turn the Champions League last-16 first leg on Wednesday. Roberto Firmino, a half-time replacement for the injured Diogo Jota, opened the scoring and James Milner was also introduced to help protect the eventual 2-0 lead. The demonstration of Liverpool’s strength in depth would not have been possible, Klopp insisted, without the determination of every player to fight against the Italian champions.  “The potential of the boys was not the key for the win at Inter, the key for it was the attitude we showed and the spirit we created on the pitch – that made the difference,” he said. “You have to fight and not think about how good we could be. We are not the Harlem Globetrotters. My opinion is clear: top squad, best I ever had, but it is more important what kind of mood is in the team because you don’t win a Champions League away game against Inter Milan because you are good. You win it because you want it with all you have and that’s what we did.” Klopp has been a leading advocate of the five-substitutes rule being reintroduced to the Premier League, in line with other major European leagues, on the basis it would ease the increased demands on players. He therefore took exception to an online report that claimed the Inter game demonstrated a club with Liverpool’s resources would gain an advantage over other Premier League teams with five substitutions available. “Honestly, for people to suggest it is an advantage tactically has nothing to do with it [his argument],” he said. “Absolutely nothing. It’s absolutely not true that it gives us an advantage. I can’t believe it is still discussed like this. It is the reason why in this country it is still not five subs. In pretty much all the other countries it is the case. It doesn’t make Bayern 20 points ahead of other teams or in Italy all of a sudden the better teams are running away with it. They are not. It is a very tight competition. In this country we hide behind the fact that: ‘It helps them, I can’t see how it helps us.’ “Look at Crystal Palace and the offensive players they have. They could change all three in each game. Five subs is a must-have for the future. It should be now already but at least for the future because we have to make sure we give the players opportunity to save energy. Because they cannot do it on the pitch we have to do it like this. Nobody thinks it’s an advantage from a tactical point of view. A few people think: ‘That’s why Klopp wants five subs, because he can bring these guys on.’ It has nothing to do with that.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp angrily rejects claim that five substitutes rule favours Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/jurgen-klopp-angrily-rejects-claim-that-five-substitutes-rule-favours-liverpool
2/19/2022,"Boris Johnson will tell fellow western leaders that only overwhelming solidarity in the face of Russian aggression can avert a devastating conflict in Ukraine, as he flies to the Munich security summit on Saturday. The prime minister will call on allies to “speak with one voice,” as he prepares to deliver a speech at the annual gathering, against the backdrop of mounting anxiety about Moscow’s intentions.  Events on the ground in Ukraine were moving at ominous speed on Friday, with Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country announcing they planned to evacuate about 700,000 people to Russia from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). On Friday evening the Foreign Office announced the British embassy in Kyiv will “temporarily” relocate to Lviv in the west of Ukraine. Russia has said Ukraine is committing “genocide” in the eastern Donbas – a claim flatly dismissed by Kyiv. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Kyiv had been acting with restraint despite provocative heavy shelling from separatist-controlled areas in recent days. In another sign of the growing tensions, a car bomb exploded in the rebel-held city of Donetsk on Friday afternoon. Nobody was hurt in the blast, which took place outside the separatist-controlled administration building. Late on Friday, a gas pipeline near Luhansk caught fire after “a powerful explosion”, Russian news agencies reported. A second blast hit the city about 40 minutes later, the agencies said. The explosions follow multiple warnings by Johnson and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, among others, that Russia could use “false flag” incidents as a pretext to justify a military attack on Ukraine. In recent days, western allies have rejected claims that Russia is withdrawing troops from Ukraine’s border, and raised concerns about shelling by Russian-backed separatists, saying Moscow may be hoping to provoke retaliation to justify military action. Johnson has discussed the crisis with a series of western leaders in recent days and will hold face-to-face meetings with allies in Munich on Saturday. In remarks released by Downing Street before his trip, Johnson said: “There is still a chance to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, but it will require an overwhelming display of western solidarity beyond anything we have seen in recent history. Allies need to speak with one voice to stress to President Putin the high price he will pay for any further Russian invasion of Ukraine. “That is the message I will take to Munich today as we redouble our efforts to prevent a grave miscalculation which would devastate Ukraine, Russia and the rest of Europe.” The government has drawn up a package of sanctions ready to be applied to Russia in the event of an escalation in the conflict. The UK is regularly accused of providing a welcome home for the assets of wealthy Russians connected to the Kremlin. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announced on Thursday that she was ending tier 1 “golden” investor visas, which allowed rich foreigners to apply for citizenship, as part of a “renewed crackdown on fraud & illicit finance” – a move widely seen as closing an entry route used by Russian oligarchs. Western officials hinted on Friday that sanctions could be launched against Russia in the event of a cyber, paramilitary or other non-conventional attack against Ukraine ordered by the Kremlin. Although a conventional military attack is still considered possible “with very little notice”, western officials are also concerned about a possible escalation of the conflict by Russian separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region or further cyber-attacks on Ukraine, following the targeting of banks and government earlier this week. An official said the simplest scenario for triggering economic sanctions would be that “missiles might start firing, tanks start coming across the border”. But they added, “there are other scenarios, very plausible ones, under which the kinds of events we’ve seen over the last 48 hours continue to increase in frequency and intensity, that you see more cyber-attacks, that you see a really big escalation of cyber-attacks against the government of Ukraine. And in that situation, the reality is, it would be more difficult to call exactly when a line had been crossed.” The topic of what conflict situation would lead to the triggering of economic sanctions against Russia has been under active discussions between the US, EU and UK. It “cannot only be if there are missiles or tanks or whatever, we may need to judge response in a more complex situation,” the official added. Analysts believe the next 48 hours are likely to be critical. All the signs suggest Russia is moving inexorably towards some kind of military offensive against Ukraine, a view shared by London and Washington. Putin is personally presiding over nuclear military drills on Saturday.",News/World news,Boris Johnson calls on west to ‘speak with one voice’ on Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/boris-johnson-calls-on-west-to-speak-with-one-voice-on-ukraine-crisis
2/19/2022,"Nearly four weeks have passed since Arsenal last played at the Emirates and there will not be many fond memories of that occasion. They toiled against Burnley and, in keeping with current fashion, ended with 10 men. Fine margins like this are supposed to matter when you are fighting for the top four: Sean Dyche’s side had only kept one away clean sheet in the league all season so it was surprising that they held out for a point in relative comfort. Arsenal were sixth then, just as they are now, but the picture is markedly different. The scales have tipped in their favour. A win at Molineux in their only game of the intervening period helped but the shortcomings of those around them have done just as much to define the mood. Since the draw with Burnley, the two teams above them and the pair below have played a total of 10 games and amassed 12 points. Manchester United, West Ham, Tottenham and Wolves remain squarely in the Champions League race but, despite barely kicking a ball for a month, Arsenal find themselves in the box seat.  They have three games in hand on United and West Ham, who are four and two points ahead of them respectively. Brentford are Saturday’s visitors and it feels a long time since, in the opening match of the campaign, a Covid-hit Arsenal were pummelled in west London with Ivan Toney claiming: “I don’t see them winning anything any time soon.” The Bees’ striker may technically be right, but given Arsenal’s past half-decade Mikel Arteta would be perfectly entitled to go along with Arsène Wenger’s pronouncement in 2012 that fourth place would count as a “trophy”. Arsenal looked weak that night at Brentford Community Stadium, cowering under a barrage of set pieces and direct balls. It seemed a familiar tale but they have become a side with backbone and Arteta agrees that his players are mentally tougher than six months ago. “Defeats are a big part of that mental toughness,” he said. “They prepare you, they make you tougher. [The team] understand the suffering you go through when you lose a football match and you have critics, when everybody is questioning you. You have to fight against that situation: that is what creates mental toughness as well.” Arteta wants Arsenal to be punchy, as long as they stay within acceptable limits. That, in itself, has caused plenty of discussion since Gabriel Martinelli’s unusual sending-off at Wolves. It was their fourth red card in six games across all competitions and the 15th of the manager’s 26-month reign. Arsenal are not a dirty side; more one prone to fleeting lapses of judgment that are natural in a young squad that probably needs to operate near the edge to compete. The theories about refereeing bias and conspiracies circulating among sections of the fanbase are nonsensical, even if the consistency of top-flight officials has patently been imperfect, but Arteta is canny enough to know a them-against-us mindset can work in Arsenal’s favour. “One hundred per cent,” he said when asked whether a bunker mentality would bring his squad closer together. “I want the team to feel they have the tools and the right mindset to face anything in front of us. Whether it’s through injuries, bad decisions, through whatever way it comes, the team has to be prepared; that mental toughness is something you have to work on every single day.” One element of context against Brentford, before any new controversies come into play, is the fact Arsenal have little wriggle room where squad depth is concerned. If anyone had to be suspended for a match at this point Martinelli was probably the best candidate, simply because Emile Smith Rowe is a more than satisfactory replacement on the left flank. The deputy option would be a step down in virtually any other position and there is a sense that, despite their favourable standing and the excellence of their first-choice side, the season will stand or fall on keeping players available. It is likely someone will need to step up from the fringes and Arteta still holds hope that Nicolas Pépé, who finished 2020-21 with a bang but has played 24 minutes in the Premier League since 18 October, can be the difference-maker Unai Emery thought he had purchased in 2019. “Since he has come back from Afcon I think I have seen a different Nico,” claimed Arteta, who has made similar pronouncements in the past. “He had a brilliant end of the season last year. He can replicate that. We need him at his best because everybody is going to contribute. We are a really short squad at the moment and hopefully he has understood that we want to play him.” Brentford, desperate for a win to fend off the threat of a relegation battle, will be rugged opponents. “We know the stage of the season we are at and what the aim is,” Arteta said. Arsenal may have been able to watch top-four rivals smooth their path in recent weeks, but their tight-knit unit now has to prove its worth.",Sport/Football,Arteta senses Arsenal have backbone to stand tall in battle for top four,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/arteta-senses-arsenal-have-backbone-to-stand-tall-in-battle-for-top-four
2/19/2022,"Pep Guardiola says he never “started a fire” within Manchester City over the failed summer bid to buy Harry Kane from Tottenham. The champions host Spurs in Saturday’s late game when the centre-forward is expected to start for Antonio Conte’s team. Guardiola had targeted Kane as his preferred No 9 but insisted there was no complaint when the club could not prise him from Tottenham.  “I was never in my 11- or 12-year career disappointed in what the club I manage cannot do in the transfer market,” he said. “And I never created a fire here because I represent the club and the club is always beyond myself by far. When we have some talks and cannot agree, we do it internally. We tried [for Kane] but it was far away [from] being done because Tottenham were clear this is not going to happen. And when they say this two, three, four times, it’s over.” Despite missing out on a proven goalscorer, City sit nine points clear of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League, having played one more match. Guardiola admits the lack of a focal point in attack caused him uncertainty going into the campaign. “Now you can say: ‘Harry Kane didn’t come and everything is going well,’” he said. “But at the time I didn’t know it. We lost to Spurs [in the season opener] and Leicester in the Community Shield. And I don’t know what will happen in the next few weeks. The club gave me players and I’m always delighted – and it’s then what we can do together. Maybe if we had a proper striker we would play with a striker but with the players we have we have to adapt. “I know they [the club] do the best for me. When we lose we are sad but nobody is pointing fingers saying: ‘Your fault, your fault, your fault.’ We don’t do that. That’s why I’m happy here. At other clubs when you lose it’s: ‘What’s the problem?’” Guardiola also reflected on his error in his first Premier League meeting with Conte in December 2016. He switched to a three-man defence to mirror the Italian’s Chelsea formation. “We played three at the back, we lost 3-1,” he said. “What a decision I made.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola has no complaints over City’s failure to sign Harry Kane,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/pep-guardiola-has-no-complaints-over-citys-failure-to-sign-harry-kane
