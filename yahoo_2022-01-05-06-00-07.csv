1/5/2022,"Some Capitol police have complained that Sergeant Harry Dunn has made January 6 ""all about race."" Dunn tearfully recounted being called the N-word during a July testimony before the January 6 committee. Some officers' outspokenness about Trump has revealed other divisions within the Capitol police. In the wake of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, members of the police force tasked with guarding the building remain divided along lines of both race and politics. According to a report from The New York Times, some officers have grown weary of Capitol Police Sergeant Harry Dunn's prominent role as an advocate for the Capitol Police, complaining that by talking about the racism he endured on that day, he is making it ""all about race."" Dunn, according to the report, grew increasingly despondent after the attack, choosing to eat lunch alone in his car. He began talking more to the media, giving an anonymous interview to BuzzFeed days after the attack where he recounted crying ""is this America?"" in the Capitol rotunda. He eventually was cleared to speak more to the press, sitting for interviews with ABC News, CNN, and The New York Times. But some in the Capitol police force, which is mostly white, told The Times that they were uneasy with Dunn's increasingly public-facing role, given that the two officers who died after the attack were white. But Dunn said they were only focusing on part of what he'd discussed, and that he also sought to defend the bravery of the entire force. Dunn's outspokenness also prompted a fellow officer, Sergeant Aquilino Gonell, to begin speaking out as well. Recently, Gonell gave an interview to NPR where he condemned former Vice President Mike Pence's minimization of the attack as ""pathetic"" and ""a disgrace."" Dunn and Gonell later went on to testify before the House select committee investigating January 6, where Dunn recounted being called the N word by protestors. ""Well, I voted for Joe Biden. Does my vote not count? Am I nobody?"" Dunn said he told a crowd of rioters after one claimed that ""nobody voted for Joe Biden."" ""You hear that, guys, this n----- voted for Joe Biden!"" said a woman in a pink ""MAGA"" shirt, per Dunn's testimony. ""Boo! Fucking n-----!"" the crowd chanted. —Andrew Feinberg (@AndrewFeinberg) July 27, 2021 Some officers also told the New York Times that ahead of January 6, they didn't trust their colleagues to stay in line if former President Donald Trump lost but refused to leave office, and that they openly questioned whether fellow officers would ""turn their guns"" on them if they ""tried to stand in Trump's way."" Gonell also said that he wondered aloud last month ""how many officers were questioning whether they were willing to risk their lives should Trump ever summon his followers to the Capitol again."" The wife of one of the Capitol police officers, named only as ""Nicole,"" said that the police force's leadership deserves more blame than Trump, since her husband was sent into battle ""without so much as a helmet.""

1/5/2022,"A prosecutor said Monday he'll ask the Justice Department to review the case of two people charged in the shootings of two police officers at a northern Illinois hotel, and also asked federal prosecutors to pursue a death sentence, CBS Chicago reports. Darius Sullivan and Xandria Harris are charged with fatally shooting Bradley police Sgt. Marlene Rittmanic, 49, and critically wounding her partner, Officer Tyler Bailey, 27, late Wednesday. Prosecutors said Sullivan likely killed Rittmanic with her own service weapon as she begged for her life. Illinois is not a death penalty state, but the U.S. Attorney General can authorize the filing of a petition to seek the death penalty in a federal murder case under certain circumstances, Kankakee County State's Attorney Jim Rowe said during a bond hearing for Xandria Harris, 26, of Bradley in Kankakee County Circuit Court. ""I will be submitting an official request to the U.S. Attorney General for the Central District of Illinois and to the U.S. Attorney General to review the first degree murder case pending against Darius Sullivan and Xandria Harris for federal murder charges, and pursue a federal sentence of death against both defendants,"" Rowe said. The State's Attorney will also seek life sentences for both Sullivan and Harris as the existing state-level charges proceed, Rowe said. Judge Kathy Bradshaw Elliott granted a request to deny Harris bail, telling Harris: ""You are a real threat to the community."" Sullivan, 25, of Bourbonnais was arrested Friday at a home in North Manchester, Indiana, police said. CBS Chicago reports that prosecutors said that Rittmanic and Bailey had been called to the hotel for a complaint about barking dogs that had been left in a guest's car. Bailey ran the license plate of the car with the barking dogs, and found it belonged to Harris, prosecutors said. Rittmanic and Bailey went upstairs to room 308 with the intention of issuing a ticket for a local noise ordinance violation against Harris because of the barking dogs, and to arrest Sullivan on outstanding warrants, prosecutors said. The officers first knocked on the door of room 308, but there was no answer. When officers knocked again, Bailey announced it was the police, and said they needed to address the complaint about the dogs. Harris, who was pregnant at the time, said from behind the door that she would be coming out of the room, prosecutors said. Finally, after 14 minutes, Harris opened the door to the hotel room, prosecutors said. She tied to squeeze past the door and close it to prevent officers from arresting Sullivan – who was also in the room, prosecutors said. As Bailey and Rittmanic kept asking Harris to stop blocking the door, Sullivan came from around the room holding a 9mm handgun with a drum clip, prosecutors said. Sullivan shot Bailey in the head, and then fired a first shot at Rittmanic as she tried to get out of his range, prosecutors said. Sullivan then chased Rittmanic down the hallway and pinned her up against a door, prosecutors said. His gun became jammed at that point, and he began trying to unjam his own gun with his left hand while also trying to disarm Rittmanic with the other, prosecutors said. Amid the struggle, Harris walked down the hallway and told Sullivan to ""cock the gun."" Sullivan went on to get a hold of Rittmanic's gun, prosecutors said. Sullivan and Harris then stood over Rittmanic as she lay on the floor – already having been shot once. By this point, Harris was holding Sullivan's gun, while Sullivan had Rittmanic's duty weapon in hand, prosecutors said. Sullivan then fired two shots at Rittmanic from what was believed to be her own weapon – while Harris handed some keys to Sullivan and told him he had to go, prosecutors said. Sullivan then fired the final fatal shots at Rittmanic, prosecutors said. ""Sgt. Rittmanic was pleading with them just to leave, you don't have to do this, please just go, please don't, she was desperately pleading for her life,"" prosecutors said. Rittmanic died that evening. Bradley remained in critical condition Monday. The case will go before a Kankakee County grand jury on January 22. The next court date for Harris is January 27 when she will be arraigned. In Wabash, Indiana, meanwhile, Sullivan is fighting extradition to Illinois. Rowe said he will start the process of asking Indiana's governor to sign a warrant to have Sullivan extradited to Kankakee County. On Saturday, Bradley police issued an alert through a Facebook post of fake GoFundMe accounts using Rittmanic's name. The family is not using any online crowdfunding sources, according to the statement. Illinois State Police released a statement Monday on behalf of Rittmanic's family: ""To her – the job was about making her community safe for everyone, she believed – and stated, 'just because you can, doesn't mean you should.' Meaning – if you have statutory grounds to arrest a person, tow their car, or fine them, doesn't mean you should."" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

1/5/2022,"Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez was a full-on Florida woman over the long holiday weekend and got burned for it (and we’re not talking about the sun). The New York congresswoman was first spotted Thursday enjoying a drink with her boyfriend Riley Roberts at Doraku Sushi in Miami Beach, the National Review reported. AOC, as she is known, got slammed on social media for being a hypocrite as she staunchly supports mask mandates in her home state and wasn’t wearing one in the pic an anonymous onlooker took. “Welcome to Florida, AOC!” tweeted Gov. Ron DeSantis’ official account with a screenshot. After the subsequent backlash, the 32 year old pol responded on social media to her haters: “If Republicans are mad they can’t date me, they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet,” she tweeted on Friday, referring to Roberts’ beach sandals. “Ya creepy weirdos.” In Florida that same day, the CDC reported more than 75,900 new cases of COVID-19. The Bronx native added fuel to the Twitter dumpster fire when video came out of her partying (again, maskless) Sunday at the Palace Bar’s famed drag brunch (again outdoors) in South Beach. AOC was also seen hugging fellow attendee Broadway icon Billy Porter, also bare faced at the packed, raucous bash. AOC was spotted partying in a bar maskless in the great free state of Florida. Absolute hypocrite pic.twitter.com/5lPEtPTnib — Libs of Tik Tok (@libsoftiktok) January 2, 2022 To note: There are no mask mandates in place in the state of Florida, despite the spike in COVID-19 cases. “AOC is STILL lounging it up in Florida, in large crowds and maskless. This time at a Drag Queen bar in Miami,” summed up right wing commentator Brendon Leslie. “Rules for thee, but not for me.’ AOC did not comment on social media regarding that event and her Instagram contains zero pictures of her fabulous vacation down south. But she did get some support from local Dem activists, Our Revolution’s Twitter account with the handle @Rev305: “While it’s been an absolute riot to watch folks (plus the DeSantis troll farm) lose their minds to see AOC exist, the rampant homophobia in the replies & quote tweets has been disgusting & disappointing,” read Monday’s post. “We support our LGBTQ friends & families and implore you all to as well.”",U.S./Miami Herald,AOC gets slammed (again) for partying maskless at this drag brunch in Miami Beach,https://news.yahoo.com/aoc-gets-slammed-again-partying-190257159.html
