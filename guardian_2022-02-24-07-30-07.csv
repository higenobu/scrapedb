2/24/2022,"Labour will seek to “reimagine the role of government” as a partner to the private sector and take advantage of the opportunities of Brexit, Keir Starmer will say in a speech on the economy. Setting out his blueprint for future growth, the Labour leader will name six principles for the economy under a Labour government, starting with valuing the role of private companies as a partner to the state.  He will also lay into Rishi Sunak saying the Conservatives have “introduced 15 tax rises, increasing taxes more than any other Chancellor in half a century”. Speaking in Huddersfield on Thursday, Starmer will say that after 12 years of Conservative government, the “days of economic fatalism are over” as he seeks to inject a note of optimism about the future of the economy under a Labour government. “With Labour, Britain will once again grow,” he will say. “And from the proceeds of that growth we will build a new economy and a new Britain, one based on security, prosperity and respect for all.” The Labour leader will also stress his backing for British business saying: “Britain cannot rise to the great challenges of the day without the innovation of business.” He will say: “A political party without a clear plan for making sure businesses are successful and growing … which doesn’t want them to do well and make a profit … has no hope of being a successful government.” His comments will be seen as an attempt to draw a further line under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, who was viewed with suspicion by many big business interests because of his support for nationalising some sectors. Starmer’s support for the government partnering with companies is likely to dismay critics on the left of the party, while his focus on the opportunities of Brexit is likely to frustrate staunch remainers. He received a sceptical response from Gaya Sriskanthan, co-chair of Momentum, the socialist group set up under Corbyn’s leadership. Sriskanthan said: “The public aren’t stupid. They know that pushing more growth, when growth benefits only those at the top, misses the mark. “Fixing it requires taxing the richest, taking on corporate interests and bringing key industries into public ownership - all policies popular with the British public. The Keir Starmer of 2020 recognised this, and was elected leader by the Labour membership as a result. The Keir Starmer of 2022 should follow suit.” His other focal points for the economy include: putting money back in people’s pockets; revitalising the places that once powered Britain; ending the era of insecure employment; and driving up productivity and wages. Starmer has been touring the country in recent weeks as he seeks to turn the conversation on to the cost of living and improving people’s lives after drawing a dividing line with the Tories over the Partygate scandal. The party’s strategy is for Starmer to keep his focus on issues such as tax and the cost of living to keep the heat on Tory divisions, as well as put Sunak in the spotlight given his ambitions to succeed Johnson as leader.",News/Politics,Starmer: Labour will partner with private sector and take advantage of Brexit,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/starmer-labour-will-partner-with-private-sector-and-take-advantage-of-brexit
2/24/2022,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will say he wants to cut taxes “sustainably” and downgrade the role played by the state as an engine of growth, in a landmark speech that aims to quell concern among Tory backbenchers about the tax burden rising to its highest level in 70 years. Spelling out a personal philosophy on Thursday in his first major speech since Downing Street scandals opened the door for a change of leadership at the top of the Conservative party, Sunak will say only a market economy, driven by private sector spending, will create the dynamism needed to maintain sustainable growth.  Governments should set the conditions for businesses and households to thrive, but otherwise should take a back seat, he will argue. “I firmly believe in lower taxes,” he will say in the Mais lecture, an annual event at Bayes business school that chancellors have used in the past to outline their overarching doctrine. A rise in national insurance in April and tax rises on businesses next year will push the overall level of tax to about 35.5% of GDP by the end of the parliament – its highest level since 1948. Though still lower than France, at more than 40%, and Germany at 39%, several Tory MPs have complained that the rise in taxes will undermine the party’s economic credibility at a time when households face an unprecedented squeeze on living standards. Sunak has battled several cabinet colleagues in recent months to restrain public spending, most recently rejecting health secretary Sajid Javid’s demand that billions of pounds be allocated to maintain free Covid-19 testing. While some MPs are expected to interpret his comments as a rebuff to Boris Johnson’s aim to ramp up government spending to level up the regions and improve public services, Sunak will point to a rise in public sector investment to its highest sustained level as a proportion of GDP since the 1970s, as proof that he takes a balanced view of the public finances. “The most powerful case for the dynamic market economy is that it brings economic freedom and prosperity,” Sunak will say. “And the best expression of that freedom is for all of us to be able to make decisions about how to save, invest or use the money we earn. “The marginal pound our country produces is far better spent by individuals and businesses than government.” In 1984 Nigel Lawson used the Mais lecture to spell out his belief that personal financial freedom and free markets were the route to sustainable growth. Sunak will echo these comments, saying: “As a machine for innovation and growth the free market is positively correlated with almost everything we imagine is desirable for humanity: higher living standards, greater wellbeing, longer lives lived in greater leisure, freedom and peace.” Adding: “Capital. People. Ideas. Three priorities to deliver higher productivity, tied with one golden thread: that what government does is far less important than creating the conditions for private businesses and individuals to thrive.” But in a warning to the right of the Conservative party, Sunak will dismiss the claim “tax cuts always pay for themselves”, describing it as “flippant”. He will challenge the idea that taxes should be cut even when that would leave spending budgets unfunded, saying: “I am disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that ‘tax cuts always pay for themselves’. They do not. “Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make difficult and often unpopular arguments elsewhere.” Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Sunak’s comments showed he was wedded to outdated free market ideology that mistakenly focused on cutting public expenditure as a route to economic growth. “If the Tories had matched Labour’s record on growth in government, businesses would have grown faster and people would have had higher incomes, boosting the public finances. “It is because the Conservatives are the party of low growth, that they are now the party of high tax.”",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak to say he wants to cut taxes ‘sustainably’ in landmark speech,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/rishi-sunak-to-say-he-wants-to-cut-taxes-sustainably-in-landmark-speech
2/24/2022,"One of the most aggressive criminal investigations against Donald Trump appears to be running into the sand after the two leading prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney’s office investigating the former president’s finances resigned. The inquiry by Manhattan prosecutors into the operations of Trump and the Trump Organization has been among the most dangerous of the many legal perils facing him. The investigation, which began in August 2018 under the former district attorney Cyrus Vance and continued under incumbent Alvin Bragg, has dug ever deeper into alleged discrepancies in the value of the family’s assets in an effort to show a pattern of fraudulent behavior.  According to the New York Times, the two top prosecutors on the case, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, quit the proceedings amid signs that the move on Trump is stalling as it reaches a make-or-break moment. The Manhattan district attorney’s office confirmed to the Guardian that Dunne and Pomerantz had resigned. They said in a statement that they were “grateful for their service”. The statement also insisted that the investigation into Trump finances was “ongoing”. The newspaper reports that a grand jury convened under the Manhattan investigation as the first step towards indicting the former president has gone silent for the past month, with no witnesses called before it. Anonymous sources told the Times that Bragg, who took over the investigation when he began as DA in January, had indicated that he was uncertain about taking the case to the next level. Whatever Bragg decides to do in the coming days and weeks, it is clear that his office has been under mounting pressure recently as the inquiry reached a critical stage. Prosecutors were aware that the clock is running down as the present grand jury’s term comes to an end in April. It was always going to be a tough call whether or not to pursue Trump all the way to court. As a criminal proceeding, the standard of proof is high – not only would Trump have to be found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt” but prosecutors would have to show that he willfully committed the crime – hard to do in cases of alleged financial fraud. Should the criminal investigation of Trump and his family business collapse, that still leaves the civil investigation that is being conducted by the New York state attorney general, Letitia James. For several months the two cases have been run in tandem, with the prosecutorial teams working closely together. In January James opened a window on what the two teams of prosecutors had come up with when she alleged that Trump and his family business had “falsely and fraudulently” valued multiple assets. They included golf clubs, hotels and real estate holdings which James alleged were either inflated in value to attract loans or undervalued to reduce the company’s tax burden. Trump and his lawyers have consistently denied any wrongdoing, and decried the parallel probes against him as a politically motivated witch-hunt. Both Bragg and James are Democrats, while Trump arguably remains effective leader of the Republican party. The news that the criminal investigation might be running into difficulties is the first piece of potentially good news for Trump in several weeks relating to the many legal threats he is facing. In recent days he has been battered by a succession of dire developments on multiple fronts. Last week his longtime accounting firm broke off relations with the Trump Organization saying that a decade of financial statements it had approved were no longer reliable. Days later a New York judge ruled that Trump and two of his children – Donald Jr and Ivanka – had to testify under subpoena in the James investigation. With regard to on-going investigations into his role in the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, which are also gathering pace, the US supreme court delivered Trump a blow last month. It allowed White House documents which Trump had been trying to block to be turned over to the House committee investigating the events of that day. In addition to the James investigation, Trump faces several other potentially serious legal actions. He is being sued for defamation by the journalist E Jean Carroll who has alleged that he sexually attacked her in the 1990s; a federal judge this week sounded dismissive of attempts by Trump’s legal team to counter-sue Carroll. The former president is also the subject of a grand jury in Georgia which is looking into whether he criminally violated election laws when he urged the state’s chief elections administrator to “find” him 11,780 – one more than would have secured him victory.",News/US news,Key inquiry into Trump’s finances in jeopardy as two prosecutors resign,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/donald-trump-new-york-investigation-prosecutors-resign
2/24/2022,"Where did that come from? Manchester United had laboured sorely, the errors and the looseness coming from a variety of players. Atlético Madrid appeared happy and comfortable with a 1-0 scoreline and it was easy to think that this was set to be another Champions League misstep from United, who have won only two knockout ties since their run to the final in 2011. Ralf Rangnick’s players had created next to nothing, although they were better in the second half after a torrid opening period when João Félix’s lovely header had been scant reward for Atlético. And then it happened.  Rangnick had introduced the 19-year-old winger, Anthony Elanga, in the 75th minute and, with pretty much his first involvement, he scored the goal that turned this tie upside down, breathing hope back into his team. It was Bruno Fernandes who picked the pass – finally, after a hugely difficult evening – and, when Reinildo Mandava, the Atlético central defender, gambled and lost, stretching in for the interception and missing the ball, Elanga was away. The finish was nerveless. After Premier League goals against Brentford and Leeds, this was the moment when Elanga announced himself on the most glittering stage. There would still be time for Antoine Griezmann, on as a substitute, to rattle the crossbar but this had turned into United’s night. And that of Elanga. It was an evening for cojones, to quote Fred, the United midfielder, and one of those evenings that shuddered with significance at every turn. The tone was set by the raucous welcome that the home support afforded the Atlético team bus; flares lit, songs belted out. “Vuela Atleti” read the slogan on the massive tifo that was unfurled before kick-off. Fly Atleti. Maybe it was the rarity value of United, as much as anything else. The club that considers itself to be European royalty has not exactly been a force in the Champions League knockout rounds of late; their record overshadowed and then some during the last decade by what Simeone has achieved at Atlético. This is Atlético’s ninth straight season in Europe’s elite competition, their eighth appearance in the knockout phase and, in five of those, they have reached at least the quarter-finals. On what was one of the most high-profile games of Rangnick’s career – given his lack of experience in the Champions League – his selection decisions were always going to be scrutinised. The big one was to give Victor Lindelöf the starting nod at right-back, which felt risky. Could Rangnick get his players to show the needed intensity at the first whistle? The short answer was no. United were all over the place in the opening minutes and the path to Atlético’s breakthough goal was extremely well lit. There was the needless concession of an early corner by Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes giving the ball away three times in what felt like the blink of an eye and David de Gea scuffing a clearance. The nerves jangled loudly. Lindelöf had to bail out Fernandes, jumping into a brave block to keep out a José María Giménez shot. The goal came after Lindelöf had cleared from a corner. Atlético worked it to Renan Lodi and his whipped cross from the left was a seductive invitation for Félix to throw himself at the ball. Which he did, the diving header a moment of the highest quality, all hang time and perfect body shape. It kissed the inside of the near post and went in. Maguire was the nearest United defender and he was not very near. United tried to dig out a foothold by simply keeping possession. They were not going anywhere with it but it did not seem to matter. Anything to distil a few dregs of confidence. But the rest of the first half continued to be scarred by United surrendering the ball, with numerous players culpable. It was mainly because Atlético rushed players around it at the right moments and also cut off United’s passing lanes. Where were the options before the interval? United looked swamped. The only mercy for Rangnick following an abject first 45 minutes was that the damage was not heavier. It would have been had Sime Vrsaljko converted another excellent Lodi cross at the far post after Atlético had almost walked in up the left. Instead, Vrsaljko’s header hit Lindelöf and ricocheted against the woodwork and away. It shaped up as an ordeal for Cristiano Ronaldo. Whenever he was on or even near the ball, the boos dripped with venom. He has hurt Atlético so many times in the past that their supporters do not care to remember and how they loved it when he remonstrated with the referee, arguing for fouls, the frustration etched into every pore. United’s first-half output in creative terms was derisory and the hope from their side was that they could not possibly remain as shapeless after the break. Even so, there continued to be moments that made the travelling support shudder. Fernandes ballooned a cross intended for Paul Pogba; Marcus Rashford did likewise with a pot shot from distance. He had nothing on, a theme of the evening, so he tried his luck – and perhaps wished he had not. It was niggly, fouls prominent, with United struggling to legitimately suppress the twinkle toes of Félix. And yet, despite it all, Rangnick’s team retained a puncher’s chance. If only they could fashion just one clear opening. Rangnick trusted in his 4-3-3, making like-for-like substitutes, including Nemanja Matic for the ineffective Pogba. He also swapped both of his full-backs but it was the introduction of Elanga that would make the difference.",Sport/Football,Anthony Elanga punishes Atlético with late equaliser for Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/23/atletico-madrid-manchester-united-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report
2/24/2022,"Liverpool blew away Leeds to such an extent at Anfield that Pep Guardiola may have been able to feel their breath on the back of his neck in Manchester. City’s comfortable 12-point lead at the top of the Premier League is a distant memory and Jürgen Klopp’s “pain in the ass” are closing in. Klopp celebrated an emphatic rout of Leeds with six punches in front of the Kop: one for each goal that his rampant team swept past the ridiculously exposed Illan Meslier. Mohamed Salah scored two penalties, Sadio Mané struck twice, Joël Matip converted a fine goal and Virgil van Dijk joined his defensive partner on the scoresheet in stoppage time. Liverpool sent out a statement of intent with their game in hand on the Premier League leaders.  Liverpool’s hunger was evident from the start as Fabinho and the recalled Curtis Jones snapped into tackles while Luis Díaz swept down the left. So too was Leeds’ defensive vulnerability, although that was also unsurprising given an injury list that forced Marcelo Bielsa to deploy Luke Ayling as a makeshift centre-half and switch Stuart Dallas to right-back. Salah, Díaz and Mané revelled in the spaces that opened up in the visitors’ uncertain backline. Only four minutes had elapsed when Mané released the Colombia international in space and, with the ball seemingly glued to his right foot, he waltzed inside two white shirts before curling for the far corner. Díaz’s goalbound drive struck Mané on the back and deflected harmlessly wide, but Leeds would not be reprieved for long. On the front foot, and brave as always in possession, Bielsa’s side initially caused Liverpool problems. They were simply unable to retain the ball long enough to threaten seriously. Daniel James dispossessed Alisson inside the Liverpool penalty area but, having fallen in the challenge, he was unable to convert into an empty net before Joël Matip cleared to spare his goalkeeper’s blushes. James again lost his footing when played in behind the Liverpool defence by Mateusz Klich. By that stage, however, Leeds were chasing the game. Liverpool were awarded their first penalty when Jones’s quick free-kick to Fabinho caught the visitors asleep. Andy Robertson received possession on the left and drilled in a first-time cross that struck Dallas’s outstretched right arm. The referee Michael Oliver had no hesitation in awarding a spot-kick and Salah sent Meslier the wrong way to score his 18th league goal of the season. Leeds thought they had levelled from a superb team move that flowed from back to front through Dallas, Klich, James and Rodrigo before Jack Harrison centred for Raphinha to convert at the back post. Their celebrations were curtailed by a correct offside call against Raphinha and, moments later, Leeds’ night deteriorated further. Matip strolled out from the back, as he was invited to do all night, before finding Salah and darting into the area. Salah returned an exquisite pass between the legs of Junior Firpo for Matip to clip in a fine first goal of the season. Liverpool needed no assistance to confirm their superiority but were awarded a second penalty when Ayling was adjudged to have clipped Mané as he raced through on goal. The Leeds’ captain had a reasonable case that Mané caught him while cutting in front, but, once VAR confirmed contact had been made in the area, Oliver’s initial decision was upheld. Salah went the same way with his penalty and Meslier went the right way on this occasion, but did not get near the Egypt international’s effort as it flew over him. It was the 53rd goal Leeds had conceded in the Premier League this season. In the entirety of last season they conceded 54. Leeds were in danger of unravelling as the interval approached. Heads dropped, simple passes went astray and their defensive structure vanished. Fabinho should have made it four but side-footed wide when Trent Alexander-Arnold’s free-kick landed at his feet in front of goal. Salah almost claimed his hat-trick when played through by Alexander-Arnold’s brilliant instinctive pass but his chip over Meslier was hooked off the line by Firpo. Salah was naturally desperate for his hat-trick and angered whenever the chance passed him by. One attempt, curled to the far corner having cut inside Firpo, was saved by Meslier. Another was swept high into the Kop following unselfish work from Jones who, with only the keeper to beat, squared for his insatiable teammate. Jones departed to a deserved standing ovation as James Milner was introduced against his boyhood club for the 801st appearance of his outstanding career. Liverpool added a fourth in style. Salah found Jordan Henderson with an exquisite return ball to the substitute, who crossed first-time for Mané to sweep an unstoppable finish into the roof of Meslier’s net. Another flowing move brought the fifth. Henderson and Milner combined to release Divock Origi on the left and, despite Meslier’s best efforts to save at the substitute’s feet, the ball broke for Mané to tap his second into an empty net. There was still time for Van Dijk to add a sixth with a free header from Robertson’s corner.",Sport/Football,Salah and Mané double up in Liverpool’s trouncing of threadbare Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/23/liverpool-leeds-united-premier-league-match-report
2/24/2022,"In their seventh league game of 2022 Crystal Palace cavorted to their first win of the calendar year, two late Wilfried Zaha goals adding gloss to an ultimately emphatic victory over a Watford side whose defensive issues were repeatedly exposed, often voluntarily. It is hard to blame Roy Hodgson for the failings of a team that so many other coaches have also failed to inspire, but there was certainly nothing in this game to make anyone at Palace regret no longer having him in their dugout as, its defending at one first-half corner apart, their side appeared both better coached and better motivated, strong in defence, vibrant in attack and ruthless in exposing their hosts’ weaknesses.  Saturday’s victory over Aston Villa had applied the defibrillator paddles to the Hornets’ battle against relegation, which in losing so limply to Brighton in their previous home game they appeared to have all but surrendered. The starting XI may have been unchanged from the weekend but the atmosphere was transformed, with the home fans feeling sufficiently positive to give the returning Will Hughes, back at the club he left in some acrimony last summer, a generous ovation before kick-off. Hughes was one of four changes made by Patrick Vieira to the team that lost to Chelsea, and after a bright start for the visitors it was another, Conor Gallagher, who had the first chance and a third, Jean-Philippe Mateta, who scored the opening goal, while the last, Jack Butland, stood largely untested at the other end. In the eighth minute Hassane Kamara’s miserable attempt to deal with Zaha’s cross from the left fell to Gallagher inside the six-yard box but the defender managed to get a redemptive toe to the ball before the Palace midfielder could force it home, then in the 15th Samir’s poor attempt to deal with Gallagher’s cross from the right ran to Mateta, whose shot held little danger before it deflected off Kiko Femenía. There was, as this suggests, an air of impending calamity that hung like a fog over the home defence. Shortly afterwards Samir provided another example, turning into Mateta and losing the ball only for Craig Cathcart to come across to slow the striker and help win it back again. By then Watford were level. Roused by the opener the following 10 minutes were their best of the opening half and it took only three of them to score, Moussa Sissoko thundering home a header from Femenía’s corner. In the following minutes Emmanuel Dennis and Joshua King both missed presentable headed chances, but in time Watford’s forward momentum faded while the air of defensive calamity did not. Following a Nathaniel Clyne cross Ben Foster saved with his legs from Michael Olise’s low shot, and then three minutes before the break the home side inexplicably ignored Gallagher as he loitered on the edge of the area as the ball was worked down the left, and when he was finally found by Clyne’s volleyed cross Kamara wildly rushed at him. Gallagher’s sublime first touch rendered the defender irrelevant, and his second sent the ball into the top corner of the net. Early in the second half Watford took off King, whose impersonation of a top-flight penalty-area goal-poacher has grown increasingly unconvincing as the season has progressed and was well controlled by the excellent Joachim Andersen, shifting Dennis to the centre with Cucho Hernández introduced on the left. It did little to reinvigorate their attack, and it took another 20 minutes for therm to create a chance, Cathcart flicking Imran Louza’s free-kick to Dennis, who stretched to nudge the ball wide. Palace did not always dominate possession, but as a rule they looked surer in defence and more threatening, if not exactly a constant menace, in attack, and might have extended their lead in the 52nd minute when Mateta exchanged passes with Zaha before running into the left side of the penalty area, from where instead of squaring to Olise he attempted a shot that rolled along the byline and out for a throw-in. Watford became increasingly desperate in their search for an equaliser, and it was Palace who eventually profited. In the 85th minute the substitute Andre Ayew chipped a cross to Zaha, who cleverly shifted it away from Femenia before lashing a low shot past Foster. There was still time for Zaha, this time played into space on the left, to cut inside before bending a shot into the far corner from the edge of the area.",Sport/Football,Wilfried Zaha’s late double for Crystal Palace hits Watford’s survival bid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/23/watford-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
2/24/2022,"Since the millennium, reality TV has undergone a slow but steady shift – away from the pseudo-sociological experiment and towards the “dinner party descends into total chaos” genre. This latter-day variant is engineered to achieve a single goal: create a situation in which a group of people argue savagely (and usually drunkenly) over an extremely large table, until at least one person storms out, and everyone else sits there looking awkward. (Masters of the manoeuvre include: Made in Chelsea, Married at First Sight, and the Real Housewives franchise.) On the face of it, the dinner-chaos format doesn’t seem the ideal vehicle for We Are Black and British (BBC Two), a two-parter that aims to examine the problems faced by Black people in the UK today, and to brainstorm potential solutions. Motivated, in part, by 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests, the show invites six Black Britons with divergent opinions on race, society and politics to live together in a Cotswolds country pile for 10 days. There, they are encouraged to engage in a series of crackingly tense debates, which routinely erupt into full-blown rows over dinner every evening.  And yet, these arguments are a world away from the squawking, self-involved drama that tends to act as reality-TV rocket fuel. Structured via a series of questions, each introduced by a different participant – “Should stop and search be stopped?”; “When Black kids fail, why do schools get the blame?” – most of the discussions are nuanced and insightful. In fact, We Are Black and British can comfortably claim to be the most intelligent reality TV show in recent memory. This is largely thanks to the participants, who all come across as thoughtful, articulate and engaging. Only two of them seem to have arrived with a fully formed worldview: Birmingham City University professor Kehinde Andrews, who describes himself as a Black radical who wants to defund the police, and 23-year-old political commentator Dominique Samuels, who doesn’t believe in systemic racism and enters the house proclaiming how proud she is to be British – with a slogan T-shirt to match. Everyone else – rapper Mista Strange, NHS doctor Raphael Olaiya, security guard and mother of two Michelle White, and property and litigation contractor Lin Mei – seems to possess a patchwork of opinions that don’t conform to any easily digestible agenda. That means group debates are often shaped by fast-moving logic and critical thinking rather than set-in-stone values. A discussion about the relationship between the police and the Black community is empathic, wide-ranging – and also deeply ambivalent. There is no right or wrong perspective here: everyone makes compelling points and equal numbers of viewers might come away convinced by Kehinde’s stance or by Lin’s. That is not to say that all of the conversations go in edifying directions. When Mista Strange wants to discuss how difficult it is for Black people to come out as gay, a highly uncomfortable chat about Christianity follows. This, in turn, is derailed by Lin and Dominique, who decide to grill the rapper about the “transgender agenda” supposedly being introduced into primary schools, in what seems like a particularly unpleasant example of whataboutery. That is really the only moment when you feel as if you’re in the Other Place. The spectre of social media debate is ever-present in We Are Black and British – but largely as a positive contrast. Twitter is where people who already know what they think about everything shout about it: this show makes room for deeply held beliefs as well as uncertainty. Its emphasis is on listening to the human being sitting next to you, and giving them a hug when they’re upset – even though you might find their political views repellent. In fact, by the end, the group dynamic is so heartening that it’s discombobulating to discover – via some light Googling – that a few participants have clearly been cast in the show precisely because they are expert in this kind of social media discourse. In a couple of cases, their online presences feel like case studies in how social media has evolved to breed division – and a reminder of how the internet can warp your impression of a person entirely. If you remain blissfully ignorant of that background, We Are Black and British is a masterclass in how to have divisive discussions in an uplifting, constructive way. And yet the show’s most memorable moments come when nobody is arguing: when Michelle breaks down in tears at the memory of her son being arrested for carrying the penknife he needs for work, or when Lin explains how her mixed-race background means she was subjected to racist abuse at family functions. There may be a questionable moral dimension to this: while the show never feels exploitative, it still asks its contributors to make themselves vulnerable by revealing distressing experiences of racism – essentially turning Black people’s pain into entertainment. But it would be difficult to make such a powerful programme about race without that emotional element. And, crucially, it also provides a sense of urgency to their discussions, underlining how imperative it is that Britain changes the way it treats its Black citizens. Something – everyone seems to agree – that is not up for debate.",Arts/Television & radio,We Are Black and British review – the most intelligent reality TV show in recent memory,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/23/we-are-black-and-british-review-the-most-intelligent-reality-tv-show-in-recent-memory
2/24/2022,"Sometimes the stars align, even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day and occasionally Eddie Jones’s views on team selection match up with those of the England masses. On Thursday night the latest indications were that by selecting a midfield combination of Marcus Smith, Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade, Thursday morning’s team announcement is set to be one of those occasions. The curveball move would have been to pick Tuilagi on the wing – as was the case against Australia in November – or leaving him on the bench but barring a late change of heart, Jones is likely to give the public what they want. For, given the options available to him, a 10-12-13 combination of Smith, Tuilagi and Slade is the most logical choice - a midfield trio providing the backbone of a lineup to quicken the pace en route to Twickenham.  To date that midfield trio have appeared together only in glimpses, including eight minutes in the victory over South Africa before Tuilagi went off with a hamstring injury, having already scored the opening try. But with 15 Tests left before the World Cup campaign begins, now is the time for Jones to unleash this perfectly-balanced combination which could wreak havoc at France 2023, the elephant in the room that is a fit-again Owen Farrell notwithstanding. It is a combination that marries Smith’s electricity at fly-half with the gainline power of Tuilagi and the abundant class of Slade as a second playmaking option. It would be so well received that supporters would not quibble as to which way round Tuilagi and Slade are selected, provided they occupy the same midfield. The theory goes that Tuilagi would link with Smith the way that Andre Esterhuizen does at Harlequins, punching holes in the Wales defence to give the fly-half the front-foot ball and space with which to work his magic. Smith and Slade dovetailed wonderfully against the Springboks despite Tuilagi’s early withdrawal so the prospect of those two working in harness with the fit-again 30-year-old is a mouthwatering one. Indeed, with the exception of Anthony Watson and perhaps Jonny May - though he has struggled for form this season - Thursday’s selection will largely reflect the New England Jones wants to take with him to the World Cup. Courtney Lawes is back available, another significant reinforcement, and there is a sense that the pieces of the puzzle are slowly but surely coming together. Jones’s other big selection calls come at No 8 with neither Sam Simmonds nor Alex Dombrandt truly seizing their opportunity in the opening two rounds of the Six Nations and between Nick Isiekwe and Charlie Ewels in the second row with question marks still persisting over the identity of Maro Itoje’s long-term partner. Jones will also decide whether to return Lawes to the captaincy – the expectation is that he will – provided he is fit enough to start and whether Ben Youngs wins his record-breaking 115th England cap from the start or the bench, given Harry Randall’s impressive performance against Italy. “I’ve got so much respect for the bloke,” said Youngs’ Leicester teammate Ellis Genge. “I can’t describe it. The stuff he’s sacrificed to achieve what he’s achieved in rugby, and what he gave up, which most people would take an arm off for, like staying at home for the Lions tours to support his brother and his family. I love him to bits, he’s a great guy. “For someone to do it 115 times, the weekend all being well, then play 200-odd times for his club as well, that’s more than 300 senior games, not bearing in mind the amateur game… he’s just so much fun to be around.” Meanwhile, Louis Rees-Zammit has been dropped from the Wales side to face England in a surprise move by Wayne Pivac, who announces his starting XV on Thursday. The 21-year-old wing has struggled for form and Josh Adams has been declared fit to start at Twickenham but the decision to omit Rees-Zammit, who is likely to feature for Gloucester instead this weekend, is a shock nonetheless given the manner in which he lit up last year’s Six Nations.",Sport/Sport,Manu Tuilagi expected to power up England’s electric Smith-Slade axis,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/manu-tuilagi-expected-to-power-up-englands-electric-smith-slade-axis
2/24/2022,"England earned a win over Germany for the second time in 27 attempts, to win the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup after late goals from Chelsea’s Millie Bright and Fran Kirby took the game beyond the visitors. With draws against Canada and Spain, England top the standings in the friendly tournament based on goals scored, after finishing level on five points with Spain.  Ellen White opened proceedings in front of 13,463 fans to join Bobby Charlton on 49 goals for England and to move within four goals of Wayne Rooney’s record. Her effort was cancelled out by Lina Magull’s powerful free-kick in the first half, but Bright’s poached effort on the rebound after a mazy run and strike from Lauren Hemp ensured England took three points and Kirby added the cherry on top of the win with a blistering goal on the counter in added time. The England manager, Sarina Wiegman, had said it did not matter who was scoring for England, as long as they were scoring, but centre-back Bright’s volley was their solo goal of the tournament before this game. There have been plenty of positives from the performances despite the lack of goals, with chances created aplenty and the defensive struggles suffered under Phil Neville look to be being ironed out. Against a depleted Germany, with 12 regular squad members unable to be called up due to injury or Covid, Alex Greenwood and Bright were partnered in defence, Chelsea’s Jess Carter was shifted to left-back and Lucy Bronze was favoured, familiarly, on the right. Behind them, Manchester City’s Ellie Roebuck was given the opportunity to attempt to win back her No 1 shirt, making her first start under Wiegman. Almost instantly England’s greatest threat, the fearless winger Hemp, went to work on the left, causing problems for the Bayern Munich defender Maximiliane Rall, but the breakthrough, 15 minutes in, would come from a more tried and tested source. Georgia Stanway, playing as a No 10, neatly played in Kirby but her shot was intercepted by the defender Jana Feldkamp who passed the ball straight back into the feet of Kirby. The Chelsea forward sent White through the middle and she calmly slotted past Merle Frohms. It is impossible to write eight-time European Cup winners out regardless of key absentees such as Alex Popp, Melanie Leupolz, Dzsenifer Marozsán and Almuth Schult but it would take a moment of brilliance to break through England’s new steely backline. Magull’s free kick, courtesy of Greenwood’s foul on Lea Schüller just outside the box, was just that, smacking down off the underside of the bar and in. If there was any deflation at having conceded a second goal under Wiegman, there was consolation to be taken in the quality of the two strikes shipped in the past six days – a far cry from the scrappy and chaotic conceded under the previous manager. Changes were made at half-time in both of England’s storm-swept Arnold Clark Cup games but here, in kinder climes, the Dutch manager did not ring the changes as readily – bar an enforced one in the 34th minute, with Rachel Daly coming on for the injured Carter. This tournament has very much been a chance for Wiegman and her staff to test partnerships, the versatility of players and formations, but perhaps this was the time to see how the closest first-choice starting XI available to her would cope in a competitive matchday scenario. Hemp again provided the brightest moment for England after the break, whizzing through the middle before hesitating just long enough for a number of German shirts to swarm around her and cut of any opening. With England struggling in the final third again, though, Stanway would make way for the Arsenal winger Nikita Parris just past the hour mark, shifting Kirby more central. The impact was instant, with Parris injecting energy on the wing and the world-class Kirby far more effective shifted closer to White. Unwilling to be outdone by the Lionesses record goal-scorer, in the 84th minute, with England in the ascendency, a sweeping run from Hemp ended with her shot deflecting off Feldkamp into the path of Bright who fired in to give England the lead. There was further cause for celebration when Kirby raced away, after a headed clearance from Bright, three minutes into six minutes of added time, and her shot squeezed past Frohms to confirm a first win against Germany on home soil.",Sport/Football,Bright and Kirby push England past Germany to secure Arnold Clark Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/23/england-women-germany-arnold-clark-cup-match-report
2/24/2022,"If there were ever fears of Burnley’s clash with Spurs being an example of “After the Lord’s Mayor Show” for the Clarets, their own leader Ben Mee ensured the procession continued. The Burnley captain spent the game flinging himself around to stop Spurs scoring before heading the winning goal to earn his side a second successive victory to boost their survival hopes. Prior to his goal, Mee had dived across his own goal to head away a Dejan Kulusevski shot targeting the bottom corner. The captain is the beating heart of the club after more than 10 years at Turf Moor, a man on a mission to ensure he does not end his anniversary season as a Championship player, as shown by his chest pumping celebrations.  Mee should have doubled the lead at the same back post he had previously been so clinical at, this time from a corner as he poked a shot goal, receiving it back to volley across the area to a waiting Jay Rodriguez who was only able to lift the ball over from six yards out, not that it mattered as Spurs had no answer in the closing stages. The swirling wind and rain implied perfect conditions for Burnley to build on their win at Brighton but it was Spurs that started the brightest, buoyed by defeating leaders Manchester City. Within a minute of the whistle Harry Kane found himself in space on the right-hand side of the area, giving him the time and space to send in a dangerous, low cross which deflected off the outside of James Tarkowski’s boot into the side-netting, though many inside the ground feared it had gone in. There was a pace and energy rarely seen from Burnley this season; Spurs’ defence did not enjoy being put under pressure, giving away a needless corner while trying to pass it around in their own area, while Ben Davies did not welcome the physicality of cult-hero-in-the-making Wout Weghorst, much to the crowd’s enjoyment. It was a night made for longer studs as the weather saw the ball hold up in gusts and players slip repeatedly in soaking conditions. Burnley enjoyed great spells of possession without the ability to find a way through the Spurs midfield block, forcing to waste the ball with a direct pass aimed at Weghorst which never came to anything. Not that Spurs fared much better as they struggled to find any space behind the trademarked Burnley back four, who diligently went about their business as the English centre-back pairing of Tarkowski and captain Ben Mee kept England captain Kane quiet in front of the watching England manager Gareth Southgate. When Spurs did finally force Mee out of position, Emerson Royal was gifted space on the right wing, only to waste it by cutting inside before swinging his left boot to send a shot high and wide from the edge of the box, ensuring Spurs ended the opening 45 minutes without testing Nick Pope. That changed quickly after the break as Mee scythed down a marauding Son Heung-min on the right wing. The South Korean peeled himself off the turf to swing in a free-kick for Kane to attack with vigour, only for the striker to see his header cannon off the crossbar inches above Pope’s outstretched hand It was that moment that created urgency within Spurs after a slow opening half. Son looked more eager to run at Burnley’s defenders, forcing them to backtrack at speed on the squelching surface. There was more space to exploit for Spurs and almost two perfect opportunities to open the scoring, only to see Erik Pieters and Mee intervene at the last second. Pope finally had to make a save in the 64th minute as the ball crisscrossed the box until Emerson Royal laid it off to Ben Davies to have a prod at goal but the goalkeeper threw out a left fist to divert the shot wide. Hugo Lloris, too, suffered a rude awakening after a long night of keeping the rain out of his eyes, as Rodriguez finally received the service he demands but his powerful downward from a perfect Dwight McNeill cross was palmed to safety by the Spurs goalkeeper. He was not able to do anything minutes later as Mee held off the challenge of Cristian Romero to head a deep free-kick to the back post across the goal to give Burnley the lead.x",Sport/Football,Ben Mee’s header sinks Tottenham and throws Burnley another lifeline,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/23/burnley-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
2/24/2022,"The award-winning singer George Ezra has been confirmed as the first act for the Queen’s jubilee event the Platinum Party at the Palace, celebrating the monarch’s 70 years on the throne. The 4 June concert will have an in-person audience of 10,000, half of which will be members of the public from a ticket ballot, the BBC reported, to be awarded in pairs.  The Queen, 95, reached 70 years on the throne on 6 February. This year will see a four-day UK bank holiday weekend from 2 to 5 June alongside a slate of celebratory events. “I can’t begin to tell you how excited I am to be part of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee concert, what an incredible honour to be asked,” 28-year-old singer said in a statement, adding he will “bring pop and roll to the palace.” The party will be formed of three stages and feature projections across the face of the palace. The event will feature a lineup of global pop and rock artists, opera singers and a full live orchestra. People can apply for the free ticket ballot online until 23 March. “The remaining tickets will be made available to charitable organisations including those who work in support of young people, the military, the environment and those who supported communities during the pandemic,” a palace statement reads. The Queen’s diamond jubilee in 2012 featured artists including Elton John, Brian May, Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue. Meanwhile, the Queen – who tested positive for Covid on Sunday – held her weekly audience with the prime minister over the phone despite her illness. “Her majesty did speak to the prime minister this evening,” a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said. It came after the monarch cancelled virtual events on Tuesday as she continued to suffer from mild cold-like symptoms of the virus. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, told MPs in parliament on Monday that the Queen’s positive test was a reminder that the virus “has not gone away”.",News/UK news,George Ezra to play Queen’s platinum jubilee party,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/23/george-ezra-to-play-queens-platinum-jubilee-party
