3/14/2022,"While Black women are twice as likely to be infertile than white women, an additional barrier when seeking assistance reproducing — egg and sperm donor shortages — is now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 11 percent of women of reproductive age in the U.S. have faced reproductive problems. Although Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show the national birth rate is higher among Black women than White women, NIH research also shows married Black women have almost twice the odds of infertility as married white women. According to the International Fertility Law Group, reproductive conditions such as fibroids, endometriosis, PCOS also disproportionally impact Black women and could lead to infertility. Michigan journalist Rhonda Spencer knew she would have problems conceiving when she married Jamal. So the couple looked into in vitro fertilization, known as IVF, but Rhonda later found out that she would also need an egg donor. Then Rhonda and Jamal hit another stumbling block in their attempt to start a family. While males can face sperm reproduction issues and infertility too, research shows that hormonal and structural problems could make it hard to conceive even with assisted reproductive technology, leading to the need for donor replacements. “Then we find out that here in West Michigan, there are no Black donors available for us,” Rhonda told 13 On Your Side, the local ABC affiliate, where she worked as a producer. “As a Black woman, I want to have a Black child. It was a hurdle that I hadn’t even thought about would be an issue, and to find out that there were none, not one, was very shocking to me and heartbreaking.” Experts say Black sperm and egg donor shortages have existed since the late 1980s. Still, the absence of young professionals and college students in metro areas because of COVID-19 restrictions and modified work settings have made recruitment a greater challenge. Once accepted, a sperm donor must return once or twice a month for six months, the International Fertility Law Group said. Egg donors have to go through at least three months of screenings. They must self-inject hormones and medications on a strict schedule for weeks, the fertility group said. Officials at the fertility center in Grand Rapids, where Rhonda lives, said just 5 percent out of 1,000 egg donor applicants were Black over three years. Even at the nation’s largest sperm banks, there is a low quantity of Black sperm available, the Wall Street Journal reported. According to the WSJ, during one week in February, four out of the 242 available sperm donors at California Cryobank said they were Black, and 18 of 360 donors at Fairfax Cryobank, based in Fairfax, Va., identified as Black. California Cryobank Medical Director Dr. Jaime Shamonki said they “cannot replenish the catalog fast enough to meet demand.” Shamonki said the sperm bank is now looking for ways to recruit more Black donors. Sperm donors are screened based on their genetics such as height, weight and medical and psychological history. They must pass infectious-disease testing, a criminal-background check and semen analysis. Sperm donors must be attending college or have a college degree. Some sperm banks allow donors to substitute professional experience for a college degree. Egg donors must pass psychological and medical screenings, including testing for the sickle anemia trait, which is more prevalent in Black people. Experts have also found Black donor shortages in the U.K. Dr. Stacey Edwards-Dunn, founder of Fertility for Colored Girls, said a stigma about fertility in the Black community stalls treatment. It starts with the misconception that Black women are fertile, which is rooted in slavery. “Much of this comes from breeding myths during slavery around our ability to be able to give birth,” Edwards-Dunn said. “But the reality is, these myths are incorrect. So it begins with how we have been socialized and educated around our own reproductive health and our Black bodies.” Edwards-Dunn said Black women and couples mistrust medical professionals, also triggered by past abuse and disregard for Black people in the medical and science field. In part, most IVF marketing and research have not included Black women or Black families. Edwards-Dunn and other fertility advocates said fertility care providers need cultural sensitivity and diversity training to check their hidden biases. There is also a lack of Black professionals in the field. “Something I hear from Black women and couples is they want the doctor and team to partner up with them in their treatment — not to look down on them or talk at them,” Edwards-Dunn said. “They want someone to walk with them on their journeys.” 13 On Your Side reported that four women immediately reached out to the Grand Rapids fertility center inquiring about egg donation when Rhonda and Jamal’s story aired last March. However, it is unclear if the couple have been able to conceive since then. Aisha Jenkins, a 46-year-old project manager in Washington, D.C., said she opted for sperm donors with Egyptian and Indian ancestry when she ran into issues finding Black sperm. “I knew there were other colors in the spectrum that would give me a brown child,” Jenkins told the WSJ. Some families who run out of options or are not in the financial position to afford IVF have turned to private donors for assistance. Numerous Facebook pages are dedicated to egg and sperm donations. Health experts, however, warn against private sperm donation because of the lack of screenings. The COVID-19 pandemic, on the other hand, has brought health care disparities to the forefront, highlighted through the Black Lives Matter movement, where there have been calls for health equity.",Health/Atlanta Black Star,‘I Want a Black Child’: Black Sperm and Egg Donors Shortage Creates Stumbling Block for Black Women Already Facing Infertility Disparity,https://news.yahoo.com/want-black-child-black-sperm-213000106.html
3/14/2022,"A Maryland county is investigating racialized threats made against Black middle school students by white students on social media. Law enforcement found images on Instagram and Snapchat that featured three young people holding what appears to be firearms, and captions that suggested the group wanted to kill Black students at the school. According to the Frederick News Post, on the morning of Wednesday, March 9, deputies from the Frederick County Sheriff’s Office and several school resource officers were notified by a parent of disturbing posts on social media that apparently were created to intimidate Black students at the school. FCSO immediately communicated with the public by posting on Facebook updates on their investigation surrounding the posts, saying that the department “takes all related racial, religious, and ethnic incidents seriously and will follow established protocols and laws to investigate each incident and will pursue criminal charges as appropriate.” The sheriff’s office maintained that this incident was a “top priority” for them. Once it was determined that there was no “immediate active threat inside the school,” deputies “continued with its criminal investigation,” and identified three white eighth graders as the suspects involved in the incident. After speaking with the students and their parents and/or guardians, officers conducted a sweep of their bedrooms, located the firearms that were depicted in the pictures, and determined that some of them “were fake” but one was real. As a part of the investigation, the students relinquished their cellphones to the deputies, allowing them to “forensically downloaded the phones, and the contents are currently under review.” Information initially gathered from scanning the phones was the approximate period around when the shots were taken. It was determined that over the last two months, January and February, the kids shot the flicks and had only recently decided to post them. The FCSO arrested the trio accused of being responsible for the posts, but because they are minors their names have been withheld from the public. On Thursday, March 10, the Frederick County Sheriff’s Office and the Frederick County Public Schools conducted a joint press conference to update the community about the racialized threats. Sheriff Chuck Jenkins took the podium during the press conference and assured those watching of the importance of every citizen living in the town. “Middleton is a very close-knit community,” he said. “It is too strong of a community to allow this to divide us. We can’t and we won’t tolerate these types of threats, messages that disrupt or create fear in our community.” “Let me be very clear … the students responsible are going to face some serious consequences.” The sheriff said that a lot of misinformation is being shared on social media and asked students and parents to refrain from posting about “the threats.” He also asked them not to identify the students (victims or perpetrators) by name on social media. Lt. Jason Deater shared that three students will be charged with a hate crime because they targeted African-Americans, “motivated in whole or in part by the group’s race.” One student will be charged with possession of a firearm by a minor because his gun was real. He said that the investigation is continuing, and they are receiving messages from Black students that the three boys reached out to directly to intimidate. Dr. Eric Louérs-Phillips, the executive director of public affairs for the school district, also spoke and said, “Racism in FCPS is unacceptable and the hate speech directed to the Black community is unacceptable.” “We know that there was no immediate threat,” he continued. “The posting of those images and the language found in those images caused harm. They caused students and staff and families of our students to feel unsafe.” The day after the press conference, the community rallied. On Friday, March 11, NBC News 4 reports, about one hundred people gathered in support of the African-American families impacted by the threats. One Black student said it was “honestly shocking that someone would post that, especially at a school like this. Usually, we are all unified.” A white student standing next to him said that he hopes that as a community they “can stay together” and one day look back and “laugh” at the incident. The sheriff’s office posted a notice about the protest on Facebook post, saying, “Expect a heavy delay around Middletown Middle School this morning as parents rally in support of recent events.” White parents immediately jumped to the comments to upbraid the department as soft-pedaling the motive behind the demonstration. One comment read, “We are supporting our african american friends, neighbors, loved ones and rallying together to show support for our community.” Onother said, “Very poor choice of words. Not ‘supporting’ recent events. How about ‘not tolerating racism?’”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘Going to Face Some Serious Consequences’: Three Maryland Eighth Graders Accused of Brandishing Guns and Threatening Black Students on Social Media Are Charged with Hate Crimes,https://news.yahoo.com/going-face-serious-consequences-three-183000057.html
