4/6/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and penalizing sanctions against Moscow have roiled financial markets and wreaked havoc on global supply chains. And JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon thinks the worst is yet to come. Dimon warned in his closely-read annual letter to shareholders on Monday that Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine is expected to meaningfully slow the U.S. and global economy. JPMorgan economists predict consequences from the war and resulting sanctions against Russia will reduce the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 12.5% by the middle of this year. The potential spillover effects have also led the bank to cut its forecast for the rest of Europe, with their GDP projections now at an annual rate of 2% in 2022, compared to the pace of 4.5% economists had expected just six weeks ago. Meanwhile, JPMorgan estimates the U.S. economy will advance roughly 2.5%, compared to the institution’s initial forecast of 3% — but Dimon cautioned in the letter that forecasts were based upon a “fairly static view” of the war. “We do not know what its outcome ultimately will be, but the hostilities in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already having a substantial economic impact,” said Dimon, adding that “many more” sanctions could be added and spur further unpredictability. “Along with the unpredictability of war itself and the uncertainty surrounding global commodity supply chains, this makes for a potentially explosive situation,” he added. Moreover, Dimon also warned the bank itself is positioned to lose as much as $1 billion over time in the first-ever comment JPMorgan has made over its potential losses from the war. Although the major bank said it is not worried about its direct exposure to Russia, the institution is concerned about the “secondary and collateral effects” the crisis and sanctions pose on so many companies and countries. Dimon did not elaborate on an exact time frame or how the estimate was calculated, but a spokesperson for JPMorgan told Yahoo Finance the $1 billion loss could be related to potential distressed assets impacted by the war. The bank earned $48.3 billion in profit on revenue of $125.3 billion last year. “America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes,” he wrote. “We should prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” The conflict in Eastern Europe is only one of several headwinds clouding the global economic picture, according to Dimon. The “confluence” of the war, the stimulus-fueled recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks quickly moving ahead to raise interest rates and the reversal of quantitative easing “may dramatically increase the risks ahead,” he said. “We are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly polarized U.S. election, mounting inflation, a war in Ukraine and dramatic economic sanctions against Russia,” Dimon wrote. “While all this turmoil has serious ramifications on our company, its effect on the world — with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order — is far more important.” — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/6/2022,"There are a multiple headwinds buffeting the markets right now, pushing stocks, bonds, and commodities in various directions. Between stubbornly high inflation, the war in Ukraine, the persistence of COVID, and even the developing instability in Chinese real estate, the possible shocks that can hit the market are enough to make any investor’s head spin. They are also a strong inducement to start taking a defensive stance on an investment portfolio. At least, that’s the bottom line from Morgan Stanley’s chief investment officer and US equity strategist Mike Wilson. Looking at the markets, and drawing conclusions, Wilson comes down to a cautious take, saying, “We remain bearish on the S&P 500 index from a risk reward standpoint, particularly after the recent rally. Our year end base case target of 4400 is 4% below current levels. At the stock level, we continue to recommend investors look for stable cash flow generating companies in defensive sectors."" This is a clear recipe for investors to follow, and will lead us quite naturally to two recent stock recommendations from Morgan Stanley’s analysts – for reliable dividend payers with attractive growth prospects. We ran both names through TipRanks’ database to see what other Wall Street’s analysts have to say about them. Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) We’ll start with a stock in one of the market’s perennial dividend champion leagues, REIT. These companies, real estate investment trusts, acquire, own, operate, and manage real properties of all sorts – residential, multi-family, commercial, retail, industrial – as well as investing in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Of interest here to defensive-minded investors, REITs are required by governmental regulators to return a high percentage of profits directly to shareholders – and dividends are a common mode of compliance. As a result, REITs are known for offering dividends that are both high-yield and highly reliable. Metro Detroit-based Agree Realty focuses on owning, developing, and leasing commercial properties for major retailers. The company boasts over 1,400 properties in its portfolio, totaling 29 million square feet and leased out to such major names as Autozone, Costco, Aldi, Best Buy, Walmart, and Sherwin-Williams. In its most recent reported quarter, 4Q21, Agree showed strength on several key metrics. The company’s top line revenue – derived primarily from property rents – came in at $91.4 million, for the eighth consecutive sequential increase. Year-over-year, the top line was up 28%. The company’s core funds from operations (FFO) was reported at 92 cents per share, while net income came out to 44 cents per share. These metrics grew by 10% and 5% y/y, respectively. For a defensive investor, the key point to note in ADC was the dividend. ADC pays out its dividend monthly, at 22.7 cents per common share. This annualizes to $2.72 per common share, and yields 4%. While there are higher dividends out there, what makes Agree stand out is its reliability – this company has a kept up its payments, consistently, since it went public back in 1994. Covering ADC for Morgan Stanley, analyst Ronald Kamdem opens his comments on the stock by pointing out the high quality of Agree’s tenants, an important differentiator for a REIT. ""Agree Realty Corporation has the highest quality portfolio among triple net REITs and a large runway for growth. ADC partners with industry-leading and growing retail tenants to provide them 1) growth capital through sale leasebacks and 2) development capabilities, where ADC builds new stores for the retailer. The growth opportunity and the defensive characteristics of the business remains underappreciated, we think. Indeed, during the post-COVID period, the multiple premium to peers has derated from +46% to +3%. Thus, we see a compelling entry point for this high cash flow, low capex, and defensive business,"" Kamdem opined. To this end, Kamdem initiated coverage on ADC shares with an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating and $75 price target. The figure implies 12.5% upside from current levels. (To watch Kamdem’s track record, click here) Morgan Stanley is hardly the only firm to rate this REIT highly; the stock has 11 recent reviews and they include 9 Buys that overbalance 2 Holds. The shares are priced at $66.66, with an average target of $75.86 indicating ~14% one-year upside potential. (See ADC stock forecast on TipRanks) AT&T, Inc. (T) The second dividend stock we’ll look at needs no introduction. AT&T is blessed with one of the world’s most recognizable corporate brands, and a long history in the essential telecom sector. In its modern incarnation, AT&T provides landline telephone services, broadband internet through fiber-optic and wireless networks, and is heavily involved in rolling out 5G in the US. AT&T boasts a market cap of $173 billion, and approximately $170 billion in annual revenues. In recent months, AT&T made an interesting divestment move. The company acquired TimeWarner in 2018, but earlier this year announced that it is spinning off its interest in the acquisition (now called WarnerMedia) to shareholders, as part of a merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. This merger will create a new entertainment company, Warner Bros. Discovery, and AT&T shareholders will each receive 0.24 shares of the new company for every share of AT&T stock owned. In conjunction with the stock spinoff, AT&T has also declared a stock dividend, to be payable in May. The dividend was set at 27.75 cents per common share, or $1.11 annualized, and yields 4.63%. The dividend is supported by AT&T’s substantial free cash flow, which was reported in 4Q21 as $8.7 billion, and for the full year of 2021 as $26.8 billion. Just as important is the reliability of the dividend; AT&T has demonstrated a long-term commitment to keeping up the payments, and has not missed a quarterly dividend since the payments were initiated 38 years ago in 1984. Analyst Simon Flannery, covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, recently attended an AT&T investor day, and wrote of the event, “We were encouraged with the improved visibility into free cash flow generation and EBITDA growth over the next couple of years. AT&T is one of the best values in our coverage universe with a pro forma dividend yield of over [4%], a double digit free cash flow yield, and a pro forma P/E multiple of just 7x on newly issued guidance... We believe the stock could see incremental investor interest after the spin is complete.” Based on the above, Flannery rates AT&T shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a price target of $28 to suggest an upside of ~16% in the next 12 months. (To watch Flannery’s track record, click here) All in all, the analyst consensus rating here is a Moderate Buy, based on 14 reviews which include 8 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average price target of $29.69 implies an upside of ~23% from the $24.18 current trading price.

4/6/2022,"Laurence Kotlikoff, the brash Boston University economics professor and Social Security expert, doesn’t mince words. “We Americans are financially quite sick,” he writes in his new book, “Money Magic: An Economist's Secrets to More Money, Less Risk, and a Better Life” before listing all the financial gaffes we Americans make in our lifetimes. “As a group, we undersave, underinsure, under diversify, pay for bad investment advice, rely on dying early, retire too soon, take Social Security at the first chance, free far too little trapped equity, borrow to invest in stocks, convince ourselves that stocks are safe long-term, live house poor,” he writes. Marriage, divorce, college, and other lifestyle decisions we make irk him as well. But it’s a lack of savings — especially for retirement — that really gets under his skin. “Most workers are saving bubkes,” he writes. “Half of today’s working families risk a major living-standard decline in retirement. The share would drop roughly in half were all workers to retire two years later.” So, he offers his retirement advice in his book, which comes with a title that is a bit of a wink. It’s not abracadabra. “It’s lifetime budgeting,” he told Yahoo Money. “It's the economics approach to financial planning … [it’s] not asking what you would like to spend, but here's what you can spend.” Here’s what else he had to say in a conversation with Yahoo Money. Laurence Kotlikoff: “The financial industry steers people looking for retirement planning advice into a fantasyland. Advisors ask them, how much would they like to spend in retirement? My answer is a billion dollars a day. Then they ask them how much are you saving? ‘Not so much. Okay Let's put you into these high-yield funds.’ Your probability of success of not running out of money is higher. And your probability of success of failing is small –that really means the probability of starving to death. So where you have financial planners kind of basically putting together a plan where the probability of starving to death is small. That doesn't sound like particularly good planning. A lot of people are just not planning for it. They leave it to somebody else. They're assuming that Uncle Sam and their employer are taking care of them. Then they are surprised when they hit retirement and find that they may not have enough money. Second, there are lots of people that are not saving in 401(k)s, or are in 401(k) plans and aren't participating enough. They're not even putting in enough to get an employer match. Taking advantage of the employer match is possibly the simplest money magic trick in the book. The average matching contribution to an employee’s retirement plan is over 4% of their pay. Yet a quarter of the workers eligible for this free money don’t participate in their employer’s plan. Let me proclaim this no-brainer: If your employer offers to give you money for free, take it. In my opinion, the whole 401k retirement account experiment in this country has failed. Yes. They retire too early thinking they're okay without really looking at it carefully. The median wealth of Baby Boomers retiring is about $144,000, which is about three years of median spending, in a retirement that could last 35 or 40 years in some cases. So most boomers are retiring with too little money by a long shot for a retirement. That money could last longer if they worked longer. I think retirement for most people is financial suicide. It's a decision to take the longest vacation of your life. At least 32% of employers don't sponsor retirement account plans, period. And they're employing a good chunk of Americans. And then we have a lot of people who have just got more pressing needs. They've got to pay for daycare. They've got to pay for the mortgage. They just don't feel they can contribute. They take Social Security too early at a much lower benefit. We have about 6% of people waiting until 70 to take their retirement benefit. My estimate is that about 85% should be waiting until 70 to take the benefit, when it’s 76% higher adjusted for inflation versus taking it at age 62. That way, you're going to have more of your resources in an inflation-protected form. And then you've got this insurance if you keep living to a hundred. You've got this much bigger number year after year coming to you. If you're disabled, and you can't work, and you don't have anything else, you're going to have to take it early, but there's lots of people that aren't and are taking it as soon as they can. I know a lot of people that have student loans at the same time are investing in stocks. It's a crazy thing to do. That was one of the things I am trying to get across in the book. So what they've done in effect is borrow money to invest in the stock market. If you put less in the stock market, and you pay off that student loan, now you're getting probably a 5%, maybe 7% return. Same with mortgages. Because of mortgage interest rate differentials, mortgages are financial losers. They’re not nearly as bad as credit card balances, student loans, or payday loans, whose interest rates are far higher, but they’re still something to be avoided when possible. Paying off household debts, starting with the highest interest-rate debts, is your best investment. It’s entirely safe and it provides you a for-sure, above-market yield. Work on your financial health now, so you can spend your money ‘til the end. That’s the object. And if you've made a lot of money, if you're rich, you don't want to put it in the stock market. The stock market could drop 50%. It has. Kerry is a Senior Columnist and Senior Reporter at Yahoo Money.

4/6/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus has revoked the contract for a third A350 ordered by Qatar Airways after the Gulf carrier rejected delivery in an ongoing dispute over damage to the surface of the long-haul jets, two people familiar with the matter said. The number of A350s grounded by the airline in the dispute over exposed and damaged lightning protection has reached 23, bringing the value of compensation sought by the carrier to slightly over $1 billion, they said. Neither company had any immediate comment. The two sides have wrangled for more than a year over accelerated surface damage that the airline says raises questions over the safety of the planes, with Qatar's regulator grounding jets as the problem appears. Airbus, backed by its own regulator, has denied any safety problems and responded to Qatar's refusal to take any more A350s until the problem is resolved by revoking deals for undelivered A350s, one by one, and axing a separate contract for A321neos. Qatar will on Thursday ask a UK judge to extend a temporary order freezing the decision to cancel the A321neo order pending a final hearing on the A350 case, expected later this year. Bloomberg News reported earlier that Airbus planned to delay a planned increase in A350 production because of the combined impact of the Ukraine war and the Qatar dispute.

4/6/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The recent rebound in equity markets will prove short-lived, one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears said on Monday, advising investors to seek refuge in bonds as economic growth slows. Most Read from Bloomberg A 30-Year-Old Crypto Billionaire Wants to Give His Fortune Away China Finds New Virus Subtype as Daily Cases Exceed 13,000 Elon Musk Takes 9.2% Stake in Twitter After Hinting at Shake-Up Ukraine Update: More Talks Possible Even as Bucha Outrage Grows Ukraine Update: Kyiv Warns Russia Is Adding Troops in Moldova “The bear market rally is over,” Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “That leaves us more constructive on bonds than stocks over the near term as growth concerns take center stage – hence our doubling down on a defensive bias.” Wilson’s thesis is that the economy is heading for a sharp slowdown, due to a “payback in demand from last year’s fiscal stimulus, demand destruction from high prices, food and energy price spikes from the war that serve as a tax, and inventory builds that have now caught up to demand.” This less forgiving macroeconomic backdrop will become increasingly harder for investors to ignore, as it eats away at corporate profits. Despite concerns that the war raging in Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions targeting one of the bedrocks of global commodity supply will exacerbate record inflationary pressures, U.S. and European equities rebounded last month, paring their quarterly losses. Wilson and his team had advised investors to sell the rally, arguing that it lacks legs. The bearish view contrasts sharply with JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s team, which has been persistently calling for more upside to equities, saying growth concerns are overblown. “Geopolitics remains a wild card, but we do not see equities fundamental risk-reward to be as bearish as it is currently fashionable to portray,” JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. While Morgan Stanley’s Wilson doubled down on his recommendation for defensive stocks, Matejka and his colleagues said traditional defensives “should not have legs to a bounce beyond the geopolitical dislocation,” advising an underweight position. At the start of the year, Wilson had the lowest year-end target for the S&P 500 index out of all the equity strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. He had similarly bearish views in 2021, which he later acknowledged were “wrong,” amid a brisk rally that pushed the main U.S. benchmark to successive records.

4/6/2022,"All eyes are on AT&T's (T) WarnerMedia spinoff with Discovery (DISCA). ""This is going to be the most exciting story in the sector for the next few years,"" Jessica Reif, research analyst at Bank of America, confidently told Yahoo Finance. The telecom giant revealed it will issue a special dividend to shareholders on April 5 when they can decide whether to own just AT&T, the soon-to-be Warner Bros. Discovery, or both. AT&T's WarnerMedia will represent 71% of Warner Bros. Discover, and its shareholders will receive an estimated 0.24 shares of the new joint venture for each share of AT&T that they own once the transaction closes. WarnerBros. Discovery, which is set to trade on the Nasdaq (^IXIC) under the ticker symbol ""WBD,"" will be run by Discovery CEO David Zaslav, with Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels serving as the new company's CFO. On Tuesday, it was revealed that WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar will depart once the merger closes, according to an internal memo. Kilar, who co-founded Hulu, was appointed by AT&T to run WarnerMedia in April 2020. ""With the pending transaction with Discovery nearing close, now is the right time to share with each of you that I will be departing this amazing company,"" Kilar wrote. ""There are many feelings one could have in a moment like this, but for me there are none bigger, or more lasting, than the feelings of gratitude and love that I have for this team, this company, and this mission. I’ve never been more fulfilled professionally. I’ve never been happier professionally,"" he continued. This is probably going to be the broadest offering the market has yet to see...
Jessica Reif, Bank of America Research Analyst Bank of America's Reif, who previously wrote that ""the combination of these highly complementary assets, has the potential to create a global media powerhouse,"" further explained how the new entity will disrupt the market. ""If you step back, this is probably going to be the broadest offering the market has yet to see,"" Reif stated, emphasizing the immense advertising potential that could result, in addition to the company's ability to optimize content spend, increase marketing efficiency and reduce churn. The analyst referenced the elevated scripted content of WarnerMedia's HBO — from cultural success Game of Thrones to the more recent phenomenon Mare of Easttown — along with Discovery's quirky, cult-favorite programs, such as Dr. Pimple Popper and 90 Day Fiancé. ""[HBO Max] is at the very beginning of its growth curve,"" Reif continued, noting the streaming service has been ""on fire,"" despite increased competition in the space. HBO Max (along with ESPN+ and Paramount+) attracted the highest year-over-year increases in downloads last month, according to a new Bank of America note, citing Sensor Tower data. The platform, which registered 9 million downloads in March (+142% Y/Y), likely benefitted ""from its generally strong content offering, additional markets vs. the year ago period as well as new/recent releases including: West Side Story, Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty, The Tourist, and Minx,"" Bank of America said. As investors begin to shift focus away from subscriber growth, Reif predicted that business operations and profitability will be key variables for shareholders moving forward. ""'Is this a real business?' 'Can you make money?' Can you offset the declines in the legacy business?'"" the analyst said, reiterating her belief that Warner Bros. Discovery has ""the best set of assets"" to not only help offset declines in the secular business but also expand ""into the next growth curves of streaming."" Still, execution remains a top challenge amid new management and restructuring woes, although Reif said she expects that the company will ""thoughtfully"" answer and respond to potential problems in due time. Overall, Reif believes that Zaslav ""will be the industry leader,"" replacing the void left by former Disney CEO (DIS) Bob Iger's departure. ""[Zaslav] has a proven track record,"" she continued, noting that the executive will be able to handle increased competition as other services begin to ramp up content production and build their individual brands and libraries.

4/6/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Cyclical shares tied to the U.S. economy’s health including banks, homebuilders and transports are struggling against the broader stock market, a telltale sign that investors remain hesitant to pour money into riskier corners of the market, according to BTIG, a U.S. brokerage firm. Most Read from Bloomberg A 30-Year-Old Crypto Billionaire Wants to Give His Fortune Away Elon Musk Takes 9.2% Stake in Twitter After Hinting at Shake-Up Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy to Address UN Body; Signal from China China Finds New Virus Subtype as Daily Cases Exceed 13,000 U.S. Switchblade Drones for Ukraine Will Include Tank Killers The S&P 500 Index has rebounded 8% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. But sectors perceived as safer such as utilities and real estate have outperformed their cyclical counterparts this year, raising questions about the durability of the benchmark index’s latest rally as investors remain concerned about the trajectory of the global economy. In a note to clients called “Trouble Brewing Under The Hood,” BTIG said it maintains a cautious view broadly on U.S. equities. “The late March rally broke the market’s downside momentum, but hasn’t thus far done enough to reverse it,” Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG, told clients. “The magnitude and velocity caused many bulls to declare the low is in, and while that could certainly be the case, when we look under the surface, the market is giving a pretty cautious message.” The recent rally in utilities and REITs has occurred alongside a surge in Treasury yields. Last week, a key part of the yield curve inverted, with the U.S. two-year yield exceeding the 10-year for the first time since 2019. That has triggered worries of an eventual recession. Investors who are hungry for yield tend to pour money into utilities and real estate in times of uncertainty because they typically pay higher dividends and have steady cash flow. Banks, however, have struggled during yield curve inversions since it can hinder their net interest margins since they’d be borrowing money at higher rates. Read: Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says ‘Bear Market Rally’ Is Now Over In addition, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which has climbed 4% in the past month, is testing support against the S&P 500 and is threatening to turn in a downtrend, Krinsky pointed out. Chip stocks, used in several hot areas of growth from data centers to artificial intelligence, were swept up in this year’s tech rout amid concerns over rising interest rates and supply shortages, but they have showed signs of demand recently. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has shed 14% in 2022. To be sure, strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. think growth concerns are overblown and have called for more upside to stocks. BTIG’s cautious view on equities comes as Morgan Stanley said the recent rebound in the stock market will prove short-lived.

4/6/2022,"If mortgage rates continue on their current trajectory, some experts predict 30-year fixed rates could hit 5% within the next month or so. Whenever rates hit this benchmark, one thing is clear: Though a 5% mortgage rate is still considered historically low, it would signify the highest level for rates in about the last decade. “While rates got very close, reaching as high as 4.94% in November 2018, they did not reach 5%, according to data from Freddie Mac,” says Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.

4/6/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. signaled its highest profit since 2008 as Russia’s war in Ukraine upended global commodity markets. Most Read from Bloomberg A 30-Year-Old Crypto Billionaire Wants to Give His Fortune Away U.S. Drones for Ukraine Will Include Latest Tank Killers Elon Musk Takes 9.2% Stake in Twitter After Hinting at Shake-Up Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy to Address UN Body; China Holds Talks China Finds New Virus Subtype as Daily Cases Exceed 13,000 Exxon’s announcement that first-quarter results may have reached almost $11 billion augurs booming profits across the oil industry as trade sanctions, shipping disruptions and surging demand strain supply lines. The windfall doesn’t come without risks, however. Key Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives demanded Exxon and peers Chevron Corp., Shell Plc and BP Plc immediately halt dividends and share buybacks until the war’s conclusion, and scolded them for “profiteering off the crisis in Ukraine.” Political leaders are under pressure to alleviate sky-high energy prices and the specter of shortages. U.S. President Joe Biden last week pleaded with the industry to reinvest profits in new wells to help plug the supply gap from shunned Russian crude. At the same time, he warned of punishing financial penalties for companies slow-walking projects involving federally owned oil prospects. The lawmakers faulted Exxon and the other three oil explorers of collectively spending $44 billion on buybacks and payouts last year and planning to shell out another $32 billion in 2022, according to a letter was signed by House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn B. Maloney and Environment Subcommittee Chair Ro Khanna. Exxon “is charging outrageous gas prices while seeing record profits,” Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a Facebook post. “We should tax Big Oil’s windfall profits and return that money to the working people of this country.” Exxon said Monday that first-quarter results may have been as much as $2 billion higher than earnings during the final three months of 2021, when the company raked in $8.8 billion, according to a filing. Crude’s Rally Surging oil prices were the main driver, with natural gas and fatter refining margins also contributing. International crude futures touched a 14-year high of almost $140 a barrel during the quarter. Separately, Exxon formally approved the $10 billion Yellowtail development off the coast of Guyana after receiving government and regulatory approvals. The project is the fourth and largest in an area known as the Stabroek Block, and is expected to pump about 250,000 barrels a day starting in 2025. Exxon also disclosed that exiting the Sakhalin-1 oil development in Russia’s Far East may trigger a writedown of as much as $4 billion. The company recently pledged to quit Russia due to international sanctions and what the company’s Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods described as the nation’s “needless destruction” in Ukraine. Exxon shares were little changed at $82.99 at 2:57 p.m. in New York. (Updates with Senator Ed Markey’s comments in sixth paragraph.)

4/6/2022,"A quick look at the charts shows just how volatile this year has been for markets. It looks something like a carpenter’s saw, with a jagged-toothed pattern, trending down and then back up. The key to the pattern is, volatility has increased this year. Uncertainty is rising, and it’s getting more and more difficult to predict where the stock market will go. What the retail investor needs is a clear signal, some sign writ large and easy-to-read, to point the way forward. We can start with the insiders. These are corporate officers, whose positions put them in place to know what’s going on behind the scenes with their companies . This is vital knowledge, that investors can use to inform their own trading. The Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, from TipRanks, makes the patterns of insider buying easily accessible. Combine that with some of the other frequently used signals – the consensus view of Wall Street’s analysts, the average upside potential, and you can quickly locate the stocks that have a clear bullish story. So let’s get started. We’ve pulled up the details on two stocks that show a combination of strong insider buying and plenty of love from Wall Street. DoubleVerify Holdings (DV) If there’s one thing that the corona pandemic crisis proved, it’s the ongoing need for digital security. DoubleVerify has known that for a decade or more – the company specializes in creating trust in digital advertising through a combination of fraud identification and brand reputation building. The company was a pioneer in digital ad verification, and today provides a wide range of media authentication services for customers in a variety of businesses, including financial services, telecom, retail, automotive, travel, and pharmaceuticals. While DoubleVerify has been in business since 2008, it only went public last year. The company held an IPO in April of 2021, a successful launch of more than 13.33 million share into the public domain. The initial price rage was expected at $24 to $27; the stock opened at $35, and closed its first day at $36. DV raised approximately $360 million in new capital through the IPO. In the past few years, DoubleVerify has taken frequent steps to boost its footprint through smart acquisition and partnership moves. In October of 2018, DoubleVerify announced a partnership with Twitter, for the authentication of video ads. That partnership was expanded in August of last year, when DV teamed up with the Twitter company MoPub to provide fraud detection, protection, and reporting. MoPub handles ad requests between advertisers and more than 1.5 billion addressable users worldwide. Following that, in September of last year, DoubleVerify partnered with TikTok to measure viewability and invalid traffic. DV will offer advertisers on TikTok a range of services, including data validation and campaign optimization. And on the heels of the coup, DV in November 2021 completed an agreement to acquire the contextual targeting platform OpenSlate in a cash and stock transaction valued at nearly $150 million. All of this has had a predictable impact on DV’s financial results. In 4Q21, the most recent reported, the company showed $105.5 million at the top line, a company record and up 35% year-over-year. DV has reported 4 quarterly results since its IPO, and showed sequential revenue gains in the last three of them. For the full year, DV reported a 36% y/y gain in revenue, to reach $332.7 million. On the insider front, DV's CEO Mark Zagorski made the most recent ‘informative buy.’ He picked up over 19,800 shares, paying over $508K for them. Covering DV for JMP Securities, analyst Andrew Boone is also bullish. He writes: “With difficult comps across digital advertising and macro risks growing, we believe DoubleVerify has a highly defensible business as it charges based on impressions (not on ad spend or pricing) and has multiple near-term catalysts ahead as TikTok continues to ramp, Twitter comes online in 1H22, and it cross-sells OpenSlate across its 1K+ advertiser partners."" ""This as we believe its opportunity is underestimated (without including its ability to offer performance-enhancing products like Authentic Attention and Custom Contextual) as 61% of its 176 client wins in 2021 were greenfield while 58% of the top 700 advertisers do not work with DoubleVerify at year-end,"" the analyst added. To this end, Boone puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on DoubleVerify’s shares. His price target of $41 implies an upside of ~54% for the year ahead. (To watch Boone’s track record, click here) Overall, the 8 recent analyst reviews on this stock break down to 6 Buys and 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. DV shares are priced at $26.55 and the $33.75 average price target suggests ~27% one-year upside potential from that level. (See DV stock forecast on TipRanks) LCI Industries (LCII) Next up, LCI Industries, is a major name in the RV niche. This is another niche that greatly benefited from the COVID crisis, as people went looking for recreational activities that would work in tandem with smaller groups and social distancing. RVing, getting to the outdoors in a self-contained unit, fit the bill, and LCI Industries has seen its revenues grow steadily since bottoming out in the second quarter of 2020. The company earned those revenues through the manufacture of RV’s and accessories. On its own, and through its subsidiaries, LCI Industries offers RV steel chassis and components, as well as the interior fittings for beds, kitchens, seating, lighting – if it goes in an RV, this company can produce it. LCII also has its hands in the light truck accessory, utility, and trailer line; the recreational marine niche; and even in the passenger railway industry. By the numbers, LCII sees approximately $4.47 billion in annual sales, and has generated a 22% 5-year revenue CAGR. Earnings have also grown fast, at 16% annual CAGR over the past 5 years. The $1.2 billion that LCII reported in 4Q21 was a company record, and up a robust 55% year-over-year. Diluted EPS came in at $3.22, for 69% y/y growth. This solid performance backs up the company’s common share dividend, which was declared in February at 90 cents and paid on March 25. With an annualized rate of $3.60, the dividend yields 3.3%. This company’s insiders have not been shy recently about picking up shares. In the last few days, there have been two million-dollar buys from corporate officers. First, Jason Lippert, President and CEO, spend just over $1 million to buy 9,265 shares. And second, James Gero of the Board of Directors, spend $1.055 million to buy 10,000 shares. Company officers are not the only bulls here. 5-star analyst Michael Swartz, from Truist, sees this firm in a solid position going forward, writing: “We believe that LCII offers limited earnings downside risk from here given the favorable pricing/cost dynamic that should hold for the better part of 2022, more diversified business mix (~50% of sales from motorized RV, marine, aftermarket and other industries), potential content/mix benefit from the unfolding trade-up dynamic discussed above, organic share gains stemming from supply chain disruption, improving aftermarket profitability and the annualized contribution from acquisitions completed during 2021 (+$320mm in consolidated sales)."" ""Based on our updated RV industry shipment estimates for 2022/2023 (+1%/-10%), we believe LCII can AT LEAST maintain 2022 sales levels into 2023,” Swartz summed up. These comments support Swartz’s Buy rating on the stock, and his $165 price target indicates potential for 52% upside going forward. (To watch Swartz’s track record, click here) While this industrial company has slipped under the radar somewhat, and only picked up 3 analyst reviews recently, they all agree that the stock is a Buy, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $108.54 and their $160.67 average price target implies a 48% one-year upside potential.

4/6/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of the shell company taking Donald Trump’s media venture public extended their selloff after a report that a pair of key executives resigned and Elon Musk bought a sizable stake in social-media competitor Twitter Inc. Most Read from Bloomberg A 30-Year-Old Crypto Billionaire Wants to Give His Fortune Away Elon Musk Takes 9.2% Stake in Twitter After Hinting at Shake-Up U.S. Drones for Ukraine Will Include Latest Tank Killers Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy to Address UN Body; China Holds Talks China Finds New Virus Subtype as Daily Cases Exceed 13,000 Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special-purpose acquisition company merging with Trump Media & Technology Group, fell 10% Monday to extend a losing streak for a seventh-straight day as downloads of the Truth Social app dry up. The decline was triggered by a Reuters report that Truth Social’s chiefs of technology and product development Josh Adams and Billy Boozer have resigned and as Musk became Twitter’s largest shareholder. Shares of the SPAC have lost 21% since March 24. Monday’s drop marks the latest disappointment for investors betting that the former president could create a media company rivaling the likes of Twitter and Facebook. More than four million shares were traded and warrants for the SPAC slipped 13% to $14.15. Details surrounding Trump’s media venture have been scarce, but the rollout of Truth Social has been plagued by snags as users were told they couldn’t sign up and others received error messages. Despite being available for more than a month, hundreds of thousands of users who were able to download the app are still on a waiting list without access to its full functionality and the app is not yet available to Android users. Downloads of Truth Social have declined 95% to less than 8,000 per day from an initial boom of 170,000 when it launched in February, according to research firm Apptopia. Representatives for Trump Media & Technology Group and Digital World didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg News emails requesting a comment. Musk’s stake in Twitter comes after he polled his followers on the social media website last month, asking whether the platform adheres to the principles of free speech. After more than 70% said no, the billionaire chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. asked whether a new platform was needed, adding that he was giving serious thought to starting his own. The aim of Trump Media & Technology group is to rival “the liberal media consortium and fight back against the ‘Big Tech’ companies of Silicon Valley,” according to an October statement. Short sellers have seen more than $106 million in mark-to-market gains since shares popped after Truth Social’s debut, according to data compiled by financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Retail traders weren’t as quick to snap up shares of Digital World, with it ranking just 18th among the most bought assets on Fidelity’s platform. The buying lagged the demand for Twitter, which was the top buy in Monday’s session and the biggest percentage gainer in the S&P 500, rising 27%. On Thursday, Digital World hit yet another snag, saying it was unable to file its form 10-K annual report with the SEC within the prescribed time period.

4/6/2022,"Hertz (HTZ) is turning up the wattage on its push to have a mostly electric rental car fleet. The company said Monday it will purchase 65,000 electric vehicles from upstart Tesla rival Polestar. Mostly consisting of the sporty Polestar 2 sedan, the purchases will occur over five years. Availability is slated to begin in the spring in Europe and later this year in North America and Australia. “Today’s partnership with Polestar further builds on our ambition to become a leading participant in the modern mobility ecosystem and doing so as an environmentally-forward company. By working with EV industry leaders like Polestar, we can help accelerate the adoption of electrification while providing renters, corporate customers and rideshare partners a premium EV product, exceptional experience and lower carbon footprint,"" Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said. The Polestar deal comes hot on the heels of one inked late last year with Tesla. Hertz said in October it had ordered 100,000 Tesla Model 3s, expected to be delivered late in 2022. The company is anticipating renting out 50,000 of those cars to Uber to support its network. ""So we are starting a great relationship with Tesla. We are also ready to partner with many other manufacturers to extend our lead in the adoptions of electric vehicles,"" former Hertz interim CEO Mark Fields said on Yahoo Finance Live in November. The EV focus by Hertz will be crucial to keeping investors engaged in its turnaround story under new CEO Scherr, who started on Feb. 28 after spending decades at Goldman Sachs in top executive positions. Hertz returned to public markets in early November following a much publicized bankruptcy, after raising $1.3 billion in IPO. Hertz sold 44.52 million shares at $29 each. It had expected to sell 37.1 million shares in a range of $25 to $29, per its prospectus. The pricing valued Hertz — which exited a high-profile bankruptcy in June — at $13.7 billion. Shares are currently trading around $21, giving it a market cap of more than $9 billion. To be sure, the deal is another win for Polestar, which is in the process of merging with a SPAC dubbed Gores Guggenheim. Polestar is expected to debut on public markets in the second quarter of 2022. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

4/6/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A hawkish Federal Reserve, high inflation, war and pestilence are among the reasons to doubt the U.S. stock market rebound. Technical studies suggest such naysayers risk missing out on a run to a record high.

Some view that as a harbinger of an economic downturn that will hurt stocks. While bear markets tend to follow eventually after some inversions, there are “strong returns from the point of yield curve inversion to the eventual stock market top,” wrote Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at Evercore ISI. He was referring to last week’s climb in the U.S. two-year yield above the 10-year for the first time since 2019. Wall Street strategists remain divided on whether the S&P 500 index is in a bear market rally -- and, if so, how long it will last. The gauge is up about 9% from a low hit after Russia invaded Ukraine, leaving it about 5% off its record from early January. The charts below track some key technical trends. Dodging the Bear The S&P 500 index undid a so-called bearish head and shoulders pattern by rallying past an early February high of 4,595 -- part of the right shoulder in the chart. This technical study suggests a target of around 5,200 is feasible, which would top the early January record close of just over 4,796. If, in fact, that January all-time high remains intact, it “would mark the first stock market peak prior to inversion in 40 years,” Emanuel said. NYSE Composite Last week, 80% of the roughly 2,000 constituents of the NYSE Composite Index -- which spans all common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange -- traded above their 20-day averages. That’s happened 56 times in the last decade, and over the subsequent 100 days after these occurrences, the gauge climbed an average 6%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tech Jump The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is also flashing some positive signals. In mid-March, it rallied more than 10% over four trading sessions. Four-day gains of at least 10% are rare, occurring 12 times in the last two decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Over the subsequent 100 days, the index returned an average of 8%.

4/6/2022,"(Reuters) -The Russian rouble rose on Monday, reversing earlier losses, and the MOEX benchmark stock index climbed to levels last seen before Russia sent thousands of troops into Ukraine, as markets awaited a new round of talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Investors were watching developments around what Russia calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine that started on Feb. 24, as well as risks of new western sanctions against Moscow on top of unprecedented penalties already imposed. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that a new round of sanctions targeting Russia was needed. ""Developments around Ukraine after the weekend again increase the degree of confrontation with the western countries,"" Rosbank analysts said in a note. At 1152 GMT, the rouble was 0.8% stronger against the dollar at 83.25, reversing earlier losses but still weaker than its strongest level since Feb. 23 of 80.3325 hit on Friday. To the euro, the rouble was up 1.8% to trade at 91.33, moving further away from an all-time low of nearly 132.42 it reached in Moscow trade on March 10. ""Russia and Ukraine talks are set to continue this week. Despite a threat of fresh sanctions, we expect the rouble to remain stable and trade at around current levels amid capital control measures,"" Alfa Bank said in a note. In recent weeks, the rouble got a boost from capital controls as well as from President Vladimir Putin's demand that European consumers of Russian natural gas pay for it in roubles. But Europe vowed to stay united against Moscow's demand, as the threat of an imminent supply halt eased. The rouble was expected to stay within a range of 80-90 to the dollar in the next two weeks, Promsvyazbank analysts said in a note. The market was also scrutinising Russia's ability to continue servicing its foreign debt. On Monday, Russia is due to pay $552 million on maturing 2022 Eurobond and $84 million in a coupon payout on 2042 Eurobond. In the stock market, jittery trading continued, but nearly all blue chips were in the black after the market reopened last week following a near month-long hiatus. The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 1.4% to 1,047.7 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was up 0.3% at 2,769.2 points after hitting its highest level since Feb. 22 of 2,835.46. Finam brokerage said in a note it expected the MOEX index to keep on climbing towards a target of around 3,080 points.

4/6/2022,"(Reuters) - Steel baron Vladimir Lisin, listed by Forbes magazine as Russia's third richest man, told Kommersant newspaper on Tuesday that Moscow's plans to charge roubles for its exports would undermine country's position on global markets. He also criticized the proposed delisting of Russian companies' depositary receipts from foreign exchanges, saying this would increase risks and undermine the rights of shareholders. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered that natural gas, exported mostly to Europe, be paid for in roubles instead of foreign currency following sweeping Western sanctions over Ukraine. European capitals have rejected the demand, which Germany said amounted to ""blackmail"". Some politicians, including the speaker of the lower house of parliament Vyacheslav Volodin, suggested Russia should sell oil, grain, metals, fertiliser, coal and timber for roubles on global markets where it is profitable. ""For decades we've been fighting for export markets... We've been developing relations with thousands of clients in 70 countries. It's hard to imagine what would convince our buyers to switch to settlements in roubles and incur currency risks,"" Lisin told the newspaper. ""Logistics problems have already complicated delivery of goods. Switching to payments in roubles will just throw us out of international markets."" Last month Lisin told employees at steelmaker NLMK, of which he is the chairman and main shareholder, that lives lost in Ukraine were a tragedy that was hard to justify, and called for a peaceful diplomatic resolution to the conflict. Lisin said in a letter to staff that was posted on social networks by an employee that the company and its board hoped the conflict would be resolved soon.

Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index (PCE) rose 6.4% in February, accelerating from a 6.1% increase in January. It represented the fastest rate of inflation since 1982. The number of S&P 500 companies citing ""inflation"" on earnings calls has hit its highest level in 10 years, says FactSet. Meanwhile, oil prices have come off their highs of around $140 a barrel seen at the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, but remain uncomfortably high above $100. Gas prices continue to be above $4 a gallon nationwide for regular unleaded, which is beginning to weigh on consumer confidence and retail store visits. As prices have climbed throughout the economy, the Federal Reserve has begun to hike interest rates to cool things down. The pace of rate hikes may be quicker than most market participants expect, as seen in the harsh reaction to stock prices Tuesday amid hawkish commentary from influential Fed Governor Lael Brainard. “Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks,” Brainard said at a conference Tuesday. “The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.” As for Bridgewater's Dalio — whose new post on YouTube titled ""Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order"" is nearing an impressive 10 million views (perhaps underscoring the concerns many folks have about the global economy and inflation at this juncture) — he thinks we could be entering a period of stagflation given the volatile backdrop. ""I think that most likely what we're going to have is a period of stagflation. And then you have to understand how to build a portfolio that's balanced for that kind of an environment,"" Dalio said. Stagflation can be defined as a period of slow economic growth, increased joblessness and rising inflation. Added Dalio, ""we are beginning a paradigm shift.""

4/6/2022,"Last year was marked by strong GDP and corporate earnings growth as the economy reopened and the workforce got back to work post-lockdowns. Stocks rose, too, reaching record highs by year’s end. That all crashed to a halt this past January. This year got started with a steady drop across the main equities indexes, especially on the tech-heavy NASDAQ. The markets troughed, deep in correction territory, in mid-March. Since then they have rebounded, and the stock market losses have moderated. Year-to-date, the S&P is down ~5%, while the NASDAQ is down ~9%. Against this backdrop, we’ve opened up the TipRanks database to find three stocks that may bear a close look in 2Q22. According to the analyst community, these are all Strong Buy equities with upside potentials starting at 50% and lifting off from there. Let’s check in with the Street’s analysts and see what else should bring these stocks to investors’ attention. ESS Tech (GWH) We’ll start with ESS Tech, a company working on modes of long-duration energy storage. This is an emerging field, given an impetus by a number tailwinds that include green tech, grid stabilization, and electric vehicles. ESS Tech focuses on the development, production, and installation of iron flow batteries, a new technology that promises to avoid the drawbacks of traditional chemical batteries, such as short life cycles, charge reduction problems, overheating, fire hazards, and corrosive chemicals. Among the specific advantages of ESS’s iron flow system, are a 20 to 25 year life cycles, encompassing more than 20,000 charging cycles without degradation of function, flexible energy storage of 4 to 12 hours, and applications in electric grid stabilization. ESS was founded in 2011, and since then has become a leader in long-duration battery tech. The company was the first such firm to enter the public markets in the US, through a SPAC transaction last autumn. In October of 2021, ESS merged with ACON S2 Acquisition, gaining approximately $308 million in gross capital from the deal. The GWH ticker started trading on October 11 and peaked above $28 the next day. Since then, shares in ESS have fallen steadily and the stock is down 80% from the peak value. In February, ESS released its financial results for 4Q21 and full year 2021. The release includes the quarter in which ESS went public. While the company does not yet have a revenue stream to report, it did have two important operational updates that bode well for future income. First, ESS reported that it added 54,000 square feet of factory space to its Wilsonville, Oregon production facility during the quarter. For the year as a whole, ESS doubled its factory footprint to 200,000 square feet. In the second operational update, one with more direct bearing on future receivables, ESS reported that its shipment forecast for 2022 is 100% booked. 5-star analyst Joseph Osha, from investment firm Guggenheim, has taken a look ‘under the hood’ at ESS, and sees plenty of potential here for future growth. “We think that ESS has a credible path to success, and we also believe that the timing is right for the market to potentially embrace a long-duration storage technology... As is the case with other new storage technology equities, the market is assigning a significant discount to ESS’s future prospects. We agree that skepticism is warranted, but in ESS’ case we believe the discount is excessive,"" Osha opined. These comments support Osha’s Buy rating on the stock, and his $10 price target implies an upside of ~78% in the next 12 months. (To watch Osha’s track record, click here) Overall, ESS has 6 recent reviews, including 5 Buys and 1 Hold, making its analyst consensus view a Strong Buy. The $12.50 average price target suggests the stock has 122% upside potential from its share price of $5.63. (See ESS stock forecast on TipRanks) Bioventus (BVS) Next up is Bioventus, an innovative healthcare company. Bioventus is focused on active healing, with a line of products that relieve bone and joint pain, offer restorative therapies, or give surgical solutions. The overall aim of Bioventus is to reduce the need for difficult orthopedic surgeries, and delay or simplify those procedures. The company’s products include an ultrasound bone healing system, Exogen; several osteoarthritis pain relievers; and orthobiologic products designed to make orthopedic surgeries less invasive and easier to recover from. In the final quarter of 2021, Bioventus announced a major expansion of its manufacturing facilities. The expansion is to a new location in Memphis, Tennessee, and will involve transferring 116 employees to a newer, larger facility. Bioventus plans to remain at the new location for at least 5 years, during which it plans to add up to 40 new positions. The move is scheduled to begin during 2H22. In March of this year, Bioventus announced that the FDA had given 510(k) clearance to the company’s StimRouter. This product is a neuromodulation system, used to treat chronic pain originating in peripheral nerves exclusive of craniofacial pains. The device uses external electric fields and is considered minimally invasive. Bioventus went public just over one year ago, and in 2021 saw its revenue increase from $81 million in Q1 to $130 million in Q4. The company’s growth caught the eye of Craig-Hallum analyst Alexander Nowak, who writes: “We see a tremendous opportunity to cross sell against the core products and leverage existing infrastructure to generate stronger growth, higher margins and a path to >$3 in earnings per share."" ""With BVS becoming an orthopedic commercialization powerhouse, a stock valued ~50% below its peers and a clear path to exceptional five-year fundamentals, we see substantial upside to shares,"" the analyst summed up. Nowak’s comments back up his Buy rating, and his $30 price target indicates the stock has potential for 120% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Nowak’s track record, click here) The Strong Buy consensus rating on BVS is based on 4 analyst reviews that include 3 to Buy and 1 to Hold. The shares are selling for $13.63 and have a one-year upside of ~58% based on an average price target of $21.50. (See BVS stock forecast on TipRanks) Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) The last stock we're looking at is Global Blood Therapeutics, a biomedical research company working on new treatments for the amelioration of sickle cell disease (SCD). This blood condition is genetically based and is highly dangerous, having been connected to both chronic severe pain and reduced life expectancy. GBT is currently in the advantageous position of having an approved drug on the market, as well as a full pipeline of viable drug candidates in clinical trials. The company’s approved drug is voxeletor, branded as Oxbryta, which saw sales reach $56.1 million in 4Q21. This was up from $41.3 million in the year-ago quarter, a 35% gain. In a recent update on Oxbryta, dated February 16, GBT announced that the drug had been approved by the European Commission for treatment of patients ages 12 and up with hemolytic anemia due to sickle cell disease. The approval makes Oxbryta marketable in all EU member nations, plus the non-EU states of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The company is pursuing separate approval in the UK. Turning to the pipeline, GBT has several ongoing trials of voxeletor, aimed at expanding the label indications of the drug. The company also has an ongoing Phase 3 trial of another drug candidate, inclacumab, which is intended as a treatment for SCD pain crisis events. Covering GBT for Wedbush, analyst Andreas Argyrides reminds investors that there are considerable gains in store for GBT in 2022. Argyrides rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $71 price target implies an upside of ~98% on the one-year time horizon. (To watch Argyrides’ track record, click here) Baking his stance, the analyst writes: ""At the end of 2021, Global Blood reported sequential +8% growth in Oxbryta sales as well as the addition of ~100 new prescribers bringing the total number of unique U.S. prescribers to ~2,000 since launch. Despite likely flat revenue growth in Q1:22, we anticipate more robust growth in H2:22 as the Company anticipates achieving broad payer coverage for SCD patients 4-<12 yo by mid-2022. Since the Company recently obtained EU approval for patients 12 yo+ in February 2022, we expect EU revenue to ramp up in 2023 as Management gains access and reimbursement in different countries."" Overall, this stock has no fewer than 13 recent analyst reviews, and they break down 11 to 2 in favor of Buy over Hold, to give GBT a Strong Buy rating. The stock’s $63.92 average price target implies an upside of 78% from the $35.91 current trading price.

4/6/2022,"As a result, we’ve seen the performance of gold rise to nearly unprecedented levels, but is the precious metal still the place to go for safe-haven investing? Gold’s reputation as a safe space to store wealth during times of economic downturns remains unscathed as the commodity continues to outperform other markets in the wake of the recent inflation-driven cost of living squeezes being experienced around the world. As we can see from the value of gold over the past five years, the commodity has continually rallied in the wake of wider market uncertainty. Although it experienced a similar dip that was felt across the market as the extent of the Covid-19 pandemic became fully known, gold’s recovery was so strong that the asset soared to new all-time highs by the summer of 2020. Although the asset’s momentum has tapered off in the months that have followed, news of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted more investors to take their money out of traditional stocks and fiat currencies and instead align it with the precious metal. Compared to just five years ago, the price of gold has grown by some 55.11% in spite of a highly volatile stock market in the wake of factors amounting to inflation, the pandemic, and geopolitical tensions. Does gold’s recent performance indicate that the asset is the safest place for investors to turn to as the stock market continues to reel from widespread uncertainty? Let’s take a deeper look at what to expect from the archetypal safe haven commodity: Despite the value of gold climbing to within $30 USD of its all-time high in the immediate aftermath, Warren Buffett has warned against investors looking to sell off their stocks in order to sit on their liquidity or to invest in assets like gold or bitcoin in response to the outbreak of war. Buffett firmly believes that the best way to navigate these times of uncertainty is to invest in businesses to build wealth over time. The world-renowned investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO told CNBC that he had no interest in selling his stocks. “If stocks are cheaper, I’ll be more likely to be buying them,” Buffett explained. “You’re going to invest your money in something over time. The one thing you could be quite sure of is if we went into some very major war, the value of money would go down. “I mean, that’s happened in virtually every war that I’m aware of,” he added. “So the last thing you’d want to do is hold money during a war.” Despite Buffett’s confidence that investing in stocks will provide more growth potential over time, the recent rise of inflation rates has negatively impacted stocks and shares around the world. The subsequent sell-offs for these stocks have presented the market with a fresh problem that wasn’t present during the 2014 invasion of Ukraine. With this in mind, holding wealth in gold may still be a good choice for investors whilst markets continue to suffer from volatility. Bitcoin has long been heralded as ‘digital gold’ due to its functionality as a more agile store of wealth. After all, BTC can be stored in blockchain wallets and sent and received all around the world almost instantly. Although it’s seen some exceptional growth during its relatively short lifespan, BTC has struggled in the wake of record-breaking inflation rates – owing to mass investor sell-offs prompted by the cost of living squeeze. Despite bitcoin’s reputation as a safe haven asset, the cryptocurrency’s well-documented volatility has led to more investors choosing to opt-out of holding the asset during market downturns. Maxim Manturov, head of investment advice at Freedom Finance Europe, has suggested that the future of bitcoin remains bright as adoption opportunities for the asset continue to grow. “Cryptocurrency is currently one of the most attractive alternatives to investing in stocks, bonds, and commodities. Cryptocurrencies are generally highly volatile, which means investors can generate high returns. Yet, with volatility come greater risks,” Manturov noted. “You no longer need a crypto wallet in order to trade cryptocurrencies. In 2021, large funds have started rolling out ETFs with direct or indirect links to crypto assets. Some of the largest and most popular Crypto ETFs include ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).” Today, cryptocurrencies like BTC carry plenty of potential, and their respective ETFs are set to open up unprecedented investing opportunities without the need for investors to immerse themselves into the crypto landscape. Although this may point to a bright future for bitcoin, gold’s outperformance in 2022 ensures that it remains a relatively safe bet during these jittery times for global markets. Until we see more confidence returning, it’s likely that bullion will remain a tried and tested safe haven asset.

4/6/2022,"More than 100 Activision Blizzard employees participated in a virtual walkout Monday as the Santa Monica video game studio joined a growing wave of companies lifting COVID-19 vaccination requirements while pressing workers to return to the office. Employees at the studio best known for its ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Call of Duty"" franchises who participated in the work stoppage took the day as an unpaid walkout day. Some joined a Zoom call that was a virtual protest gathering and spoke out on social media. The walkout came in response to the company announcing Thursday that it would no longer require employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to work in the office, according to an email from Chief Administrative Officer Brian Bulatao that was shared by employees and subsequently posted on Twitter. The email cited businesses and indoor venues across the U.S lifting their vaccine requirements and said it was “important to align our site protocols with local guidance.” Major companies such as Adidas, Starbucks and Intel have rescinded their vaccine mandates for workers in recent months after the Supreme Court in January struck down the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-testing rule for businesses with at least 100 workers. In California, a bill proposed by the Assembly that would have required all employees and independent contractors to be inoculated against COVID-19 as a condition of employment was shelved March 29. Even United Airlines, which implemented the airline industry’s first vaccination requirement for its employees in August and moved 2,200 employees with vaccine exemptions to unpaid leave or alternate roles, is allowing unvaccinated workers to return to their old posts. Activision Blizzard’s announcement “came as a shock to everybody,” said Ada-Claire Cripps, a senior software engineer with Battle.net and online products at Blizzard. Cripps said she and other employees had already been dissatisfied by the company’s previous position on returning to the office, which suggested that all workers would eventually work in person by default unless they applied for an exemption. “We’ve been able to do our jobs without needing to be physically present in the office, so this idea that we do need to be there, it seems a little unfounded,” Cripps said. With the added removal of the vaccine mandate and a spouse at home in an at-risk category for COVID, Cripps said she’s even more reluctant to return to the office. “I don’t want to have to go into a workplace where I don’t know who I can trust to not get me sick,” she said. An Activision Blizzard spokesperson denied that the company was planning to require all employees to eventually return to the office and said that a majority of employees are operating under a voluntary return-to-office policy. “When employees return to the office, as well as what their remote vs. in-person scheduling will look like, will vary by business unit and role,” the spokesperson said. Workers say they’re frustrated by the lack of clarity over how their return to the office will be handled, as well as why some employees can continue working remotely while others cannot. Andrew Carl, a senior systems designer at Blizzard’s Albany, N.Y., office, formerly known at Vicarious Visions, described the process to request an exemption from returning to the office as “onerous and doesn’t seem to be applied equally.” Carl said several co-workers who worked in quality assurance departments were told they could not continue working remotely, and others were told they must have a diagnosed medical condition to ask for an exemption from returning to the office. A Better ABK, a worker organizing group at Activision Blizzard, announced plans Friday to hold a worker walkout, listing demands to reverse the decision to lift the vaccine requirement, offer remote work as a permanent solution and allow individual employees to decide whether to work in the office or from home. Shortly after the walkout was announced, Bulatao sent out another email clarifying that though the companywide vaccine mandate had been lifted, individual studios and locations could still implement vaccine requirements for workers for the entire office. A company spokesperson confirmed the Blizzard office in Irvine as well as quality assurance offices in Louisiana, Minnesota and Texas would still require employees to be inoculated against COVID-19 to work in person. Workers are still demanding that the vaccine mandate be reimplemented across the company and that Activision have an “open and equitable” return-to-office policy. “What we want to do is make sure everybody is as safe as possible and further be protected by vaccination and testing,” Cripps said. Anthony Santella, a professor of health administration policy at the University of New Haven, said he was concerned with the “all-or-nothing” approach some companies are taking to COVID-19 safety measures. Though COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are dipping in parts of the country, increased travel in the summer months and emerging variants make lifting safety measures premature, he said. Some mitigation measures such as the daily symptom reporting and the physical social distancing requirement some companies still have in place could be eased, Santella said, but “vaccination requirements, to me that’s a non-starter.” Walkouts at Activision Blizzard have become almost a regular occurrence in the last year as a flurry of news reports detailed allegations of sexual misconduct and discrimination. Workers sought to remove Chief Executive Bobby Kotick after the Wall Street Journal reported that he was aware of but failed to report to the board several alleged sexual misconduct incidents. Employees also walked out in protest of the layoff of several quality assurance workers at the company’s Raven Software studio in Wisconsin. “There have been multiple walkouts at Activision in the past year due to management’s refusal to put the safety and protection of its workers over profits,” said Beth Allen, a spokesperson for Communications Workers of America, a nationwide union that has been assisting with organizing efforts among workers at Activision Blizzard.

4/6/2022,"By Nupur Anand and Chris Thomas MUMBAI (Reuters) -India's largest private lender HDFC Bank is buying its biggest shareholder in a $40 billion deal, the country's biggest ever, creating a financial services titan to better tap rising demand for credit. HDFC Bank's deal with housing finance firm HDFC Ltd, which owns about 21% of the lender, will build on its 68 million customers and expand its home loan portfolio significantly while also opening up the scope for larger loans. It will also help HDFC Bank shrink the gap with state-run lender and bigger rival State Bank of India while boosting competition in the home loan space as people step up purchases with pandemic woes receding. The deal will be beneficial for both companies but particularly HDFC Ltd, said Asutosh Mishra, research analyst at Ashika Stock Broking. ""(HDFC Ltd) was competing with the likes of State Bank of India in a competitive home loan market, leading to pressure on margins due to disadvantages to its cost of funds,"" he said. Following a 2018 crisis in the non-banking finance sector that shook India's financial system, the central bank issued guidelines in November allowing well-run large shadow lenders to be converted into banks. HDFC Bank shares closed 10% higher on Monday, giving the firm a market value of 9.18 trillion rupees ($121.66 billion), while HDFC Ltd surged 9.3% to a valuation of 4.85 trillion rupees. HDFC Ltd shareholders will receive 42 shares of the bank for 25 shares held, giving them ownership of 41% of HDFC Bank, which will become a full-fledged public company as the housing finance company's stake in the lender will be cancelled in the deal. Foreign ownership will account for 65-67% of the merged company, giving foreign investors scope to buy up to a further 8%, something that had also helped lift the share price, said Siddharth Purohit, fund manager at InvesQ Investment Advisors. ""The value of HDFC Ltd is $60 billion. If you strip off the portion of their holding in us, it comes to $40 billion and that's the value of the deal,"" HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan, who will head the combined company, told reporters at a press conference. That would mark the largest banking sector M&A globally since April 2007, according to Refinitiv data. BIGGER BALANCE SHEET HDFC Bank is currently a largely retail-focused operation but the $237 billion balance sheet of the combined company will allow it to underwrite larger ticket loans, including those for infrastructure. The merger, which is expected to complete in the second or third quarter of the financial year starting in April 2023, would expand HDFC Bank's loan book by 40% and the combined company's market value will rise to about $160 billion at current prices, Jefferies said in a note. HDFC Ltd Chairman Deepak Parekh said HDFC Bank has written to the central bank asking for additional time to meet certain regulatory requirements such as revised Cash Reserve Ratio and Statutory Liquidity Ratio norms following the merger. The lender has also sought clarity on whether certain subsidiaries would have to be divested where there is an overlap in the businesses of the two companies. J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Citi were among financial advisers to HDFC Bank for the deal, while Credit Suisse, Kotak Securities and Jefferies were among advisers to HDFC Ltd.
