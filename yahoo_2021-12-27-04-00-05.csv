12/27/2021,"Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones issued a ""warning"" to former President Donald Trump, calling him either ""ignorant"" or ""evil"" for encouraging people to take the coronavirus vaccine. The infamous extremist talking head made the comments during his InfoWars show on 25 December. ""This is an emergency Christmas Day warning to President Trump. You are either completely ignorant about the so called 'vaccine' gene therapy that you helped ram through with operation warp speed, or you are one of the most evil men who has ever lived,"" Mr Jones said. In the past, Mr Jones has been a staunch — but not unquestioning — supporter of Mr Trump. Mr Jones allegedly helped secure funding for the ""Stop the Steal"" Rally that eventually mutated into the January 6 Capitol riot. The conspiracy theorist's change of tune apparently was driven by recent statements Mr Trump made praising the coronavirus vaccine and encouraging conservatives not only to take the shot, but to celebrate it and see it as a conservative victory. ""What you told Candace Owens is nothing but a raft of dirty lies,"" Mr Jones said on his show. Mr Jones was referencing Mr Trump's interview with right wing provocateur Ms Owens. During the talk, Ms Owens — an anti-vaxxer — attempted to insinuate that the coronavirus vaccines do not work because more people have died from Covid-19 since Joe Biden took office and since the vaccines became available. Mr Trump cut her off and immediately derailed her argument, insisting that the vaccines did work, and that the people who were becoming ill and dying were unvaccinated. “Oh no, the vaccines work, but... the ones who get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don’t take the vaccine. But it’s still their choice. And if you take the vaccine, you’re protected,"" Mr Trump said. ""Look, the results of the vaccine are very good, and if you do get it, it’s a very minor form. People aren’t dying when they take the vaccine.” Mr Trump has long been a proponent of the vaccine, and sees it as a crowning achievement of his administration. During a speaking tour earlier this month, Mr Trump encouraged the overwhelmingly conservative audience to be proud of the vaccine. ""I think this would have been the Spanish Flu of 1917,"" Mr Trump told the crowd, who booed him upon learning he had taken a booster shot. ""This was going to ravage the country, far beyond what it is right now. Take credit for it."" Ms Owens suggested that Mr Trump — who regularly had access to briefings detailing findings from top scientists responding to the pandemic — was only pro-vaccine because he was ""too old"" to find the same obscure websites she uses for her ""independent research."" “People oftentimes forget that, like, how old Trump is,” she said. “He comes from a generation—I’ve seen other people that are older have the exact same perspective, like, they came from a time before TV, before internet, before being able to conduct their independent research. And everything that they read in a newspaper that was pitched to them, they believed that that was a reality.” Despite Ms Owen's best efforts to ease the cognitive dissonance her viewers experienced due to Mr Trump's vaccine support, the real explanation for the former president's position likely has nothing to do with his age and everything to do with his pride. Following the speaking tour where Mr Trump acknowledged that he had taken a booster shot, The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman asked the former president's team why he wasn't playing ball with the broader GOP's anti-vaxx talking points. She was handed a hand-written note bearing the former president's signature. ""Must tell the truth — and very proud to have produced the 3 vaccines so quickly,"" the note said. ""Millions of lives saved worldwide. Best wishes Donald.""",Politics/The Independent,Alex Jones says Trump is either ignorant or ‘one of the most evil men who ever lived’ in Christmas Day message,https://news.yahoo.com/alex-jones-says-trump-either-173308863.html
12/27/2021,"BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania church with a 221-year history held its final service and is scheduled to close at the end of the year because of declining membership and attendance. The First Presbyterian Church of Bellefonte, which is nearly as old as the borough itself, held the final scheduled service on Christmas Eve after having welcomed generations of families over the course of more than two centuries. “There’s just such a love among this congregation. We’ve all known each other so long and we know each other’s foibles,” church elder Candace Dannaker told the Centre Daily Times. “I’ll miss our personality, our laughter and our joy in just being together. And, of course, the faith aspect of sharing that with other like-minded people.” The church was established in 1800 by the same men who founded Bellefonte in 1795 at a time when there were only 16 states and counted among its members two former Pennsylvania governors. The church met at the courthouse for almost two decades and then in a stone edifice; the current structure was built shortly after the Civil War. Dannaker estimated the church had about 40 members before the pandemic, a number that is down to about 25, and had no in-person worship from March 2020 until Easter Sunday. When Dannaker joined 34 years ago, she said, there were about 200 people in attendance then. Pam Benson, 77, a member for 73 years, said that when she was born during World War II, many businesses were closed Sunday and few events were scheduled. She also believes that fewer parents have insisted that their children attend services and that churches haven't always been competitive in recruiting new members. “It was so different. It was just what you did. Unless you were really sick, it was just what you did,” Benson said. “It’s just change, it’s progression. It’s what happens. Not that I like it, but it is what it is.” The 15,000-square-foot church is scheduled to close for the last time Dec. 31. Dannaker said the future of the building hasn't been determined. Video of the final service posted on the church's Facebook site included references to “the pain of saying goodbye to one another"" but a reminder that “challenges aren’t anything new to humanity"" and saying the Christmas message of hope “is just as timely and essential today as it was 2,000 years ago.” Before the final hymn, members lit and raised candles to these words: “And the light has splintered the darkness. And hope is ours once more. And this light does call us forward, remembering the past, and walking confidently into the future. And now go in the peace of Christ.”",U.S./Associated Press,'Go in peace': US church founded in 1800 holds last service,https://news.yahoo.com/peace-us-church-founded-1800-155717157.html
12/27/2021,"Rep. Lauren Boebert said Kyle Rittenhouse has ""bigger intentions"" than to pursue a congressional internship. Her remarks come as several Republican lawmakers in addition to herself offered Rittenhouse an internship. Rittenhouse was fully acquitted of fatally shooting two men and injuring a third during civil unrest in the aftermath of the Jacob Blake shooting. Rep. Lauren Boebert said Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old who was fully acquitted for fatally shooting two men and injuring a third, has ""bigger intentions"" than becoming an intern for a congressional lawmaker. Rittenhouse was charged with fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and injuring Gaige Grosskreutz on the evening of August 25, 2020, amid civil unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. He was also charged with recklessly endangering two other men. Rittenhouse pleaded not guilty to all charges and took the witness stand in his own defense, testifying that he shot the men because they attacked him first. For months during his contentious trial, a slew of right-wing lawmakers and other conservatives painted Rittenhouse as a hero. After he was found not guilty, several Republican members of Congress— including Boebert and others like Reps. Matt Gaetz, Madison Cawthorn, and Paul Gosar — have offered Rittenhouse internships in their offices. Speaking on right-wing commentator Sebastian Gorka's ""America First"" podcast, Boebert suggested that Rittenhouse has far bigger plans than just a congressional internship. ""You know, he's gonna come out and visit some of us, but I think he has bigger intentions than being an intern in Congress,"" Boebert told Gorka. Rittenhouse has previously stated he has no interest in politics and intends to turn down any internship offers. ""I do not plan on accepting any internships,"" he said in on a NewsNation interview. ""I don't want to get involved in politics at all. I know nothing about it, and thank everybody for their support. But I'm good, thank you."" Instead, he said, he plans to take classes at Arizona State University and study nursing. Despite Rittenhouse's lack of interest in political involvement, the 18-year-old has become acquainted with and spent time with Republican lawmakers, including Boebert, one-on-one. In the interview with Gorka, Boebert said Rittenhouse had praised her for suggesting she participate in an arm wrestling match with Rep. Cawthorn to determine which one of them gets Rittenhouse as an intern. Former President Donald Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in November that Rittenhouse had asked to visit him ""because he was a fan."" ""Kyle, I got to know him a little bit,"" Trump said. ""He called. He wanted to know if he could come over and say hello because he was a fan."" Last month, CNN reported that Trump hosted Rittenhouse and his mom at his Palm Beach, Florida, resort.
