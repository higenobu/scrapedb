4/24/2022,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk on Sunday threw some uncertainty into his plans for a takeover of social media platform Twitter by posting a message that said he was “moving on”. Musk is famed for his enigmatic messages on Twitter, which he often uses to attack people, post insults or simply make jokes. The exact meaning of the latest cryptic message was unclear, as it simply said: “Moving on …”. But the post was made after a dramatic week where Musk, the richest man in the world, secured $46.5bn in financing to fund a possible hostile bid for Twitter, including $21bn of his own money. The funding commitments were outlined in a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk already owns 9.2% of the social media platform and announced a $54.20-per-share bid last week. Musk’s offer is viewed as a hostile bid because it bypasses the company’s board. Twitter has also launched a so-called poison pill defense, aimed at blocking Musk from building a stake bigger than 15%. Musk has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and has made clear he believes Twitter is not giving enough freedom to its millions of users. In a letter to the Twitter board he said that the platform “needs to be transformed as a private company”. He has flagged changes he might bring to the company, including introducing an edit button for tweets.",News/Technology,Puzzle over Elon Musk Twitter plan after cryptic ‘moving on’ tweet,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/24/elon-musk-twitter-message-moving-on
4/24/2022,"The NHS is paying £2bn a year to private hospitals to care for mental health patients because it does not have enough of its own beds, the Guardian can reveal. The independent sector receives about 13.5% of the £14.8bn the NHS in England spends on mental health, a dramatic rise since 2005 when it was paid £951m. Nine out of every 10 of the 10,123 mental health beds run by private operators are occupied by NHS patients. The NHS’s increasing reliance on independent care providers comes despite some health service bosses’ concerns that there are persistent – and sometimes fatal – problems with the quality and safety of care at many of the mental health units they run. Those fears, which are shared by NHS psychiatrists, mental health nurses and charities, are borne out by reports of inspections undertaken by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Figures it has provided to the Guardian show that 71 different psychiatric facilities run by non-NHS providers looking after adults or under-18s were found to be “inadequate” since the start of 2017 – more than one in four of the total of 269 such units. According to the latest research by leading the health market analysts LaingBuisson, independent mental health providers receive £1.964bn a year for treating NHS patients. They have gained a dominant role as the NHS has reduced its own stock of mental health beds despite rising demand for residential psychiatric care. The disclosure that the NHS in England is handing independent operators such a massive sum of money prompted Dave Munday, the lead professional officer for the Mental Health Nurses Association, to denounce “the scandalous privatisation of services that people who are most vulnerable rely on to survive”. Paul Farmer, the chief executive of Mind, said the “dangerous gradual reduction” in NHS beds over recent years had left it worryingly dependent on the private sector. “While this use of private care providers is itself not concerning, the fact that some patients are being transferred to private providers halfway across the country, or indeed providers who have been deemed by the CQC to be delivering inadequate standards of care, is incredibly worrying, particularly as some of these referrals seem to have led to tragic and fatal consequences,” said Farmer, who chaired NHS England’s mental health taskforce in 2015. LaingBuisson’s research also shows that: Independent mental health care providers now make 91% of their income from the NHS. Their typical profit margins are 15%-20%. A majority of inpatient care for under-18s is now outsourced, with independent operators looking after 55% of all the children and young people who are hospitalised. Non-NHS providers earn £316m a year for treating children and young people. Overall, the four biggest operators – the for-profit firms Cygnet Health Care, the Priory Group and Elysium Healthcare and the charity St Andrew’s Healthcare – receive £1.356bn – two-thirds of the nearly £2bn total. That reflects that between them they run 182 hospitals containing 6,700 (66%) of the independent sector’s total of 10,123 mental health beds. In another sign of their dominant role, the quartet have almost 40% of all England’s secure mental health beds, reserved for the most unwell patients. While private sector beds increased from 9,291 in 2010 to 10,123 in 2021, the number of mental health beds in the NHS dropped from 23,447 to 17,610 – a fall of 5,837. The NHS watchdog gave 10 of the 71 “inadequate” hospitals its lowest rating twice when, on return visits, CQC inspectors found that urgent improvements they had ordered to improve the care of people with conditions such as psychosis and bipolar disorder had not been made, with patients still exposed to danger. Dr Andrew Molodynski, the British Medical Association’s mental health policy lead, said: “The government’s persistent underfunding of NHS services and failure to address mental health bed shortages has led to a worry over-reliance on private providers, many of which have been responsible for a catalogue of patient safety failings, placing very vulnerable patients at increased risk of inadequate care or, in worst cases, self-harm and suicide.” The big four non-NHS operators said staffing problems were hampering their efforts to always provide the best possible care for patients with challenging and often complex illnesses, and that only small numbers of their facilities had been rated inadequate. A Priory spokesperson said: “Priory works in partnership with the NHS and the availability off independent mental health services enables the NHS to give very unwell patients immediate access to treatment which they often lack suitable facilities, or capacity, to offer themselves, and to free up much-needed NHS A&E beds occupied by patients in need of specialist mental health treatment.” A Cygnet spokesperson said the safety and wellbeing of service users was its “absolute priority”, adding that 82% of its facilities were rated “good” or “outstanding” by regulators. Elysium said it was proud to provide care to people at “the most vulnerable point in their lives”. It added: “While we take great pride in the leading-edge care and therapies we deliver across our hospitals, we never cease from striving to learn and improve.” Jess Lievesley, the chief executive of St Andrew’s, said that while five of the nine services it runs had been rated “good” by the CQC, three had been rated “requires improvement” and one as “inadequate”. “This is not a level of service that we are satisfied with and we’ve been restructuring our charity over the last few years to drive an improvement in the quality of care we provide,” she said. That included cutting the number of beds it operates by a third and investing more in community mental health services. An NHS England spokesperson said: “The NHS has been clear that we expect all services to provide safe and high-quality care and to deliver on our commitments in their contracts, irrespective of whether they are NHS or independent sector-led.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/24/2022,"February 2020, Britain’s restaurants were reeling. EU-based staff had been sent scurrying home by Brexit, no longer keen to work in a country that gave every impression of not wanting them. The price of imported ingredients was rising, thanks to increased bureaucracy and a weakened pound. Still, restaurateurs told themselves, at least things could hardly get worse. Enter coronavirus. At times over the past two years the pandemic has looked like it may be an extinction level event for hospitality. All the things initially blamed for the spread of coronavirus – touching, breathing, close quarters with other people – were just the sorts of things that went on in restaurants. They were blamed for not shutting soon enough, despite inadequate government assurances of financial support. Then they were blamed for not reopening fast enough, before being propelled by Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” scheme. After that, they were admonished for reopening too fast, when that measure proved at best premature and at worst foolish in the face of rising case numbers. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and the stomach rumble louder. Two years on from the first lockdown, after experiencing a world without restaurants, we know what we were missing. Even if you don’t go to restaurants often, you’ll have experienced the tingle of appreciation at being out in the world again, in elegant sociable surroundings, eating food prepared, served and washed up by others. Like the Pompidou Centre for buildings, Covid made the inner workings of restaurants clear. Nobody can feign ignorance about the money, stress and labour that goes into eating out. This new world comes with new rules. Some of the high-profile closures will be mourned more than others. Tears will flow more freely for Hix than branches of Café Rouge, or Wahlburgers, the latter the actor Mark Wahlberg’s attempt at creating a Covent Garden tourist trap, which barely got going before travel to London stopped and it did, too. “People aren’t coming back to central London five days a week, and I don’t know when tourists will be back,” says Nick Garston, an agent who specialises in restaurant properties. “But the market returned to normal remarkably fast. The big new factor is outdoor space. It’s key to what people are looking for. Before, operators might have turned their nose up at a bit of pavement with a few tables, but now they’ll try to make it work.” While there were deals to be had during the depths of the pandemic, so far landlords have been reluctant to kick out tenants, even those who have fallen behind on the rent. Bigger agents are reluctant to write down their whole portfolio, while independents mostly recognise the strains restaurants have been under. “If you evict someone, you have a period where you’re not collecting rent and then you have to market the property. You need to do the analysis.” The recent wave of high-profile new cafes in the capital – Deco, Lighthaus, Cecilia, Norman’s – is partly born from a desire to offer a more casual and flexible experience than the traditional three courses. It also lends itself naturally to all-day dining and all-day revenues. Even Gunpowder, contemporary Indian restaurants in London better known for fiery lamb cutlets, is experimenting with breakfast. Dishoom was prescient. “I think, post-pandemic, people are excited about a heightened dining experience,” says Jeremy Chan, the head chef of St James’s two-Michelin-starred Ikoyi. “People are happy to spend on quality. We do 50 covers at £250 a head. The high earners have saved so much over the past few years they’re ready to splash out.” “We have seen the return of the business lunch in a big way,” says Russell Norman of Brutto in Clerkenwell. “If you can afford the time and the expense of dining with a colleague or a client – particularly if you have a work expense account – then it seems people are doing that again after a fall, even pre-Covid. It’s very heartening to see a bottle of wine and a few negronis on most of our lunch tables.” The sommeliers agree. “Thursday is the new Friday,” says Joshua Castle, head sommelier at London’s Noble Rot. “There has been a huge uptick of interest in champagne. We thought people would have recalibrated their understanding of markups after so long at home, but it hasn’t happened. Drinkers are trading up and spending more.” “Technology has become part of the customer experience now,” says Mital Morar, the founder of the Manchester-based retail and hospitality operation the Store Group. “Covid forced us to move things along so quickly and it’s now embedded in what people expect.” The Sunday app, launched by the founders of the Big Mamma group, has experienced rapid take-up. QR codes are here to stay, at least in casual chains, because they save the staff time – five minutes per table adds up in a busy restaurant – and thereby save the owners money. The return to dining out has made diners more appreciative of the flourishes restaurants offer beyond the food and drink. “People are loving service,” says Molly Steemson, head of wine at Sessions Arts Club in east London. “All the thoughtful things you don’t get at home – glassware and oyster forks and cutlery.” “We’ve noticed that people weren’t travelling so far to dine out,” says Mary-Ellen McTague, of Campagna at the Creameries. “Pre-pandemic, people were coming from the wider Greater Manchester/Cheshire area, but that just stopped. We had to completely change our business from a tasting menu setup, to being a neighbourhood restaurant serving accessible dishes,” she says. “We have the same ingredients and quality, but totally different delivery.” At the other end of the scale, some have gone the other way, following Marco Pierre White’s rule of putting up prices in tough times. Before the pandemic, asking customers to book with a credit card could lead to much clutching of pearls. Now it’s the norm, at least at popular inner-city restaurants. “People are much more committed to their bookings,” says François O’Neill of Maison François in St James’s. “I think they have a greater understanding of how tough things have been for restaurants and the impact of last-minute cancellations or no-shows.” Out of London, the opposite can apply. “Spontaneous dining seems to be back,” says Cecilia Gillies, of Number Eight in Sevenoaks. “Following lockdowns, and having to book months in advance, people are enjoying their freedom and supporting local businesses. We have seen our walk-ins increase dramatically.” “I’ve noticed most people being very considerate and giving people space and room to pass,” says Jeremy Lee, chef-proprietor at Soho’s Quo Vadis. “There is consideration for those who still choose to wear masks. Cleaning is still a priority.” With restrictions lifted, some customers are sticking to masks while others couldn’t fling them off fast enough. Some are happy to be rammed in again cheek by jowl while others crave space. Sharing plates have become a more radical suggestion, especially among people who are not in a couple. Some customers are assiduously hand-sanitising, others are back to soap and water (we hope). “Post-pandemic dining seems to be about contradictions,” says Jacob Kenedy of Bocca di Lupo in central London. “Some customers want staff to wear masks, others are offended by them. Some want to be close and noisy, others want distance and quiet. All seem to want one more drink than before.” “After the VAT and business rates increase in April, prices will be more expensive,” says Hussein Ahmed of Viewpoint Accountants, which specialises in hospitality businesses. “This isn’t the restaurant taking the piss but the reality of increased food and drink costs, staff and overheads. If you want to keep going to your favourite restaurant, be prepared to pay more.” “Staffing remains a huge problem,” says Nick Garston. “Not just because of the pandemic, but Brexit, too.” The situation might not be as acute as it was during the reopening phase, when Omicron stalked hospitality, but the structural problems remain. For restaurateurs, this means they will have to pay their staff more; costs that will be passed on to consumers. “We found it hard to get chefs of the right calibre,” says Victor Garvey of Sola in Soho. “You can’t just give these jobs to someone who worked in a pub. But we are getting there, and we are busier than ever.” Eat now; you never know when you might not be able to again.",Lifestyle/Food,The new rules for post-pandemic restaurants,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/24/the-new-rules-for-post-pandemic-restaurants
4/24/2022,"Awinning blend of pop melodies and shoegaze textures defines the sound of Brisbane’s Harriette Pilbeam – AKA Hatchie. Songs such as the superb opener here, Lights On, join the (admittedly quite distant) dots between the Cocteau Twins and All Saints; Quicksand and This Enchanted are both blessed with huge choruses. While her influences are not hard to spot – Sky Ferreira, La Roux (on the title track particularly), Mazzy Star, Carly Rae Jepsen – they are configured in imaginative and distinctive new combinations, with lush production care of Jorge Elbrecht. In that respect, at least, Pilbeam’s second album feels like a logical progression from her 2019 debut, Keepsake, a minor success in her home country. Where Giving the World Away sees a great leap forward, however, is with its lyrics. The enforced solitude of lengthy Covid lockdowns gave Pilbeam plenty of time to contemplate and process issues around self-esteem and self-image, which she had long struggled with. Her newfound confidence is reflected in the likes of Take My Hand, with its reassuring refrain of “you don’t have to change”, and it imbues her glossy songs with warmth and intimacy.",Arts/Music,Hatchie: Giving the World Away review – newfound confidence,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/24/hatchie-giving-the-world-away-review
4/24/2022,"“Ithought she would be safe at Chadwick Lodge,” said Natasha Darbon, recalling how she felt in April 2019 when her 19-year-old daughter, Brooke Martin, was admitted to the mental health hospital in Milton Keynes. Eight weeks later, Brooke took her own life. “I thought she would be well looked-after, would recover and be able to get on with her life. I can’t get over that,” Darbon said. The jury at the inquest found that Brooke’s death could have been prevented and that the private healthcare provider Elysium Healthcare, which ran the hospital, did not properly manage her risk of suicide. It also found that serious failures of risk assessment, communication and the setting of observation levels contributed to her death. Elysium accepted that had she been placed on 24-hour observations, Brooke would not have died. Brooke, who was autistic, wanted to become a vet. Darbon remembers her as “very caring, thoughtful and sensitive.” But she was also troubled. She had a history of self-harm and suicide and had first come under the care of NHS child and adolescent mental health services at the age of 12. In 2018 she was repeatedly sectioned under the Mental Health Act because of her escalating self-harm and suicide attempts. After a spell in an NHS facility in Surrey she moved to Chadwick Lodge, which specialises in treating personality disorders. After a few weeks there, Brooke was doing well and staff were pleased with her progress. She was due to move to Hope House, a separate unit at the hospital, to start more specialist therapy for emotionally unstable personality disorder, and was keen to make the switch. But then the teenager’s mental health deteriorated again. On 5 June 2019 she tried to kill herself. Five days later she was seen twice that evening secretly handling potential ligatures, but no appropriate action was taken. A few minutes later she was found unresponsive in her room. She received CPR but died the next day in Milton Keynes university hospital. After hearing the evidence about the care Brooke received in her final days, Tom Osborne, the coroner at the inquest, took the unusual step of issuing a prevention of future deaths notice – a legal warning that details changes that must be made to stop other people dying in the same circumstances. He sent it to Sajid Javid, the health secretary, and to Elysium Healthcare, as the owner of Chadwick Lodge. It set out the detailed criticisms that the jury had made of Elysium’s interaction with Brooke after her attempt to take her own life on 5 June. They cited the hospital’s failures to communicate information regarding Brooke’s suicide attempt, to search her room after she was found handling potential ligatures on the night she died, and to place Brooke on constant observations afterwards. “[Handling potential ligatures] would and should have resulted in a full risk assessment and search of her room, that would have resulted in an increase in her level of observations to 1:1 observations,” the jury concluded. “Brooke Martin, if constantly observed or other safety measures put in place, would not have been able to tie the ligature that caused her death and would not therefore have died on 11 June 2019.” Paul Martin, Brooke’s grandfather, said: “What happened was so fundamental in error, negligence, that it defies logic. How could a company that is supposed to care for vulnerable people be so negligent?” Brooke is not the only inpatient to have died at an Elysium mental health facility. The charity Inquest represents six other families with loved ones who have died since 2016 while in its care. The inquest into the death of 16-year-old Nadia Shah in an Elysium unit in Hertfordshire in 2019 found similar failings to Brooke’s case: delayed observation and access to ligatures – a dangerous combination. Nadia’s death was due to “misadventure, contributed to by the inadequate care at the Potters Bar clinic”, the jury said. Elysium Healthcare said it had sent its deepest condolences to Brooke’s family and friends over “this tragic incident”. It reiterated what it said when the inquest concluded last July, which was that after her death it had immediately taken “significant steps” to improve patient safety at Chadwick Lodge. It also pledged to reflect and “implement where required … further learning as a result of the inquest … [to] ensure that our policies and procedures are as effective and as responsive as they can be in the provision of care for highly vulnerable people.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/24/2022,"The UK’s flagship scheme for welcoming Ukrainians has been called “heartless and inhumane” after visa officials demanded a six-month-old baby undergo security scans 800 miles from her home before she is allowed to fly to Britain. Olga Kolisnyk applied five weeks ago to take her two children – Illia, 11, and baby, Maria – to the UK from their home in war-torn Kharkiv but the process has been tied up in red tape. Kolisnyk, a university professor, was initially told by UK officials that her infant daughter would be allowed to travel as she had been added to her mother’s Ukrainian passport. But two days later she was informed by visa officials in Sheffield that this would no longer be acceptable – and that Maria would have to undergo biometric scans 800 miles away in Warsaw before they would be able to fly to Britain. The demand was criticised as “a scandal” on Sunday as the Guardian revealed further examples of UK bureaucracy preventing Ukrainians from fleeing to safety. They include: Families who applied nearly five weeks ago but are still waiting for UK visas, despite the government’s promise to approve them within 48 hours. At least 14 cases, involving nine adults and five children, where visas have been approved but the applicants have not been informed. One family of a five-year-old boy were waiting in Kharkiv while missiles fell because they had not been told that they had permission to fly to Britain. An 11-year-old boy was waiting so long his passport expired – so UK officials required him to start the process again and travel to Warsaw to undergo biometric scans. Only 6,600 Ukrainians have arrived in Britain in the five weeks since the Homes for Ukraine scheme launched, about 10% of the number of applicants. The government says it has stepped up the processing of visas in recent days and claims that some applicants are choosing to stay in neighbouring countries so they can return to Ukraine quicker. But leading charities, including the Refugee Council and British Red Cross, have said the bureaucracy involved was “causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians”. Kate Larmer, who co-founded a group that has matched dozens of Ukrainians with families in Surrey, said the UK was failing those in desperate need: “It’s a scandal. We have families who could’ve moved to safety a long time ago.” Speaking from a village outside Kharkiv, the subject of heavy Russian bombing again last weekend, Kolisnyk said she was in fear for their lives. She said: “While I’m still in Ukraine I will not feel safe. I hear somewhere not far from us the noise of bombing and I’m worrying about my family and especially my children. My only wish is to get visas for me and my son and for Maria – that’s my only wish.” Kolisnyk, 38, who taught economics at Kharkiv’s national university of radio electronics before the war, said she was terrified to make the day-long journey to Warsaw without any assurance that the visas would be approved and face having to make an 800-mile return journey into Ukraine. She said: “I worried that I’m going to Poland to Vac [Visa Application Centre] and that at the end they will just refuse and then what will I do? It’s my biggest fear. “It’s very, very stressful because of this uncertainty. I don’t know how long we will wait. I would like to say that I want the UK to make this process more easy, especially if people want to travel with small children like my daughter.” Kolisnyk and her children are living with relatives in a small house outside Kharkiv, which borders the region where Vladimir Putin’s forces launched a new offensive last week. Her sponsors are Andy Le Roux, a church pastor, and his wife, Kate Le Roux, in Odiham, Hampshire. “It’s just heartless and so inhumane,” said Kate Le Roux, a biomedical scientist. Le Roux, 45, said she had been reduced to tears after “rude” government officials refused to clarify the matter and even suggested the family should seek refuge in a country with better weather than Britain. A government spokesperson said: “In response to Putin’s barbaric invasion we have launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. In just five weeks, over 56,000 visas have been issued so people can rebuild their lives in the UK through the Ukraine family scheme and Homes for Ukraine. “Our Ukraine schemes have reached a turning point, thanks to the changes we’ve made to the streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms, and boosting staff. Around 3,500 applications have been processed a day in the last few days, enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.”",News/World news,‘Inhumane’ Homes for Ukraine scheme requests security scans for baby girl,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/inhumane-uk-homes-for-ukraine-scheme-security-scans-for-baby-girl
4/24/2022,"Tyson Fury sauntered into a plush conference room at Wembley Stadium, ripped off his shirt, placed his WBC world heavyweight champion belt on the table, sat down, smiled and began talking in a near unbroken stream of words for the next 30 minutes. He compared himself to a T-Rex who was also the greatest heavyweight boxer who has ever lived – while stressing that he was “just an average Joe”. Fury quoted Clark Gable and spun yarns about fairytales and legends. He pondered the emptiness of vast wealth but reiterated that he “came from fuck all”. The Gypsy King claimed to “feel like a dolphin in water” while fighting in the ring but described again the darkness that had engulfed him when, lost and bereft, he came close to taking his own life. Late on Saturday night a light sheen of sweat lined his face as if in reminder that, less than an hour before, he had retained his world title against Dillian Whyte in front of a crowd of 94,000. Fury had stopped Whyte with a withering uppercut in the sixth round but he had since been to the dressing room of his vanquished opponent to “give Dillian a kiss and a cuddle.” There were times, at the post-fight press conference, when it sounded as if Fury was in the midst of delivering a free-flowing eulogy for his own career. He reflected on each stage without much prompting. “I ain’t no world champion,” Fury insisted. “I’m a legend. I’m the best heavyweight there’s ever been. There ain’t ever been anyone that could beat me. I have a 6 foot 9 frame, 270 pounds of weight, can move like a middleweight, can hit like a thunderstorm, can take a punch like … anybody else.” Those last two anonymous words, said with wry acknowledgement of his own vulnerability, were preceded by a pause. But then Fury was up and running again. “I’ve got balls like King Kong, the heart of a lion and the mindset of the Wizard of Oz.” He grinned like a slightly demented wizard and then nodded. “It was a very special night. What a way to top it all off.” No one, it seems, really believes Fury will be able to give up boxing. Earlier this week he had said: “Boxing is my life. There is nothing else.” But he again suggested on Saturday that he might finally walk away. “I’ve done everything asked of me. I’ve done more promotion, more interviews than anybody. I’ve had me brains knocked out. I’ve been put down, rocked and cut. I’ve had tough fights and boxed all over the world. How much blood can you get out of a stone?” Of course professional boxing is about blood-money more than anything else and, in beating Whyte, Fury made a staggering $33,640,500 (£26,192,306). He would earn far more if he fights the winner of the rematch between Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk, who holds the IBF, WBA and WBO belts, in a unification showdown. “There’s a lot money to be earned,” Fury agreed, “but I come from fuck all, I come from nothing. It’s never been about money. I know a lot of people with big money, but none of them are happy. It’s not even been about belts or legacies for me. It’s not been about anything but punching a … face right in on the night. That’s all it’s ever been about.” Fury is addicted to the razzmatazz of boxing, he is also impressively serious about his fighting craft. He loves to learn and improve and he paid tribute to his American trainer Sugarhill Steward who began working with him two-and-a-half years ago. Since then, Fury has knocked out Deontay Wilder twice and stopped Whyte. Turning to Steward, who had also removed his shirt in solidarity, Fury said: “Years ago, I used to jib and jab, touch and slide. But you’ve made me the biggest puncher in the heavyweight division, by a mile.” He then explained how they had changed his technique. “Sugahill made me feel like a rank novice. He made me feel like a complete piece of shit – and terrible as a boxer. He took the undefeated, lineal heavyweight champion of the world [and broke him down]. He’s the only man who can make me feel like a bum, like I’ve never had a fight. But it takes a special man to go back to brass tacks and start again. We took a lot of time and trouble over the last few years. Just practise, practise, practise, long-range punching, use the jab off the shoulder. “The one punch that kept catching [Whyte] was the check hook. We practised it on the pads … bang bang … bang, bang. When I caught the Body Snatcher [as Whyte calls himself] with a left hook to the body I went: ‘You’re hurt, Body-Snatcher, ain’t you?’ And he went [Fury produces a wheezing imitation of Whyte]: ‘Yeah.’ So am I getting better? Hell, yeah.” Considering Whyte’s limited role in the extravaganza on Saturday Fury said: “He tried to make it rough, fair play to him. But he was trying to wrestle with a dinosaur. I’m like a T-Rex in there.” Fury grinned. “I was on fire tonight. I really enjoyed myself. I feel at home in that ring, I feel like a dolphin in water. It’s what I was born to do because I was always meant to be heavyweight champion of the world. I’m now going to become the second heavyweight in history after Rocky Marciano to retire undefeated.” A Ukrainian journalist, sharing the disbelief that the Gypsy King is about to abdicate, asked Fury if he would prefer to fight Usyk or Joshua. After praising his rivals, Fury rocked back in his chair: “Like Clark Gable would say: “I just don’t give a damn who wins …” He thanked his promoter Frank Warren who “brought me back from the brink of death and believed in me and gave me a big contract to box again [in 2018] … I’m just a normal lucky man, an average Joe, and I’ve proved that anything’s possible. It doesn’t matter where you are, how dark the place you’re in. It doesn’t get any darker than when you’re committing suicide and I was there. To lose all that weight, 10 stone, and to get mentally well again, to regain the crown jewels … it’s been a fantastic career. “I think this is it. This might be the final curtain for The Gypsy King. What a way to go out.” That simple word of “might” lingered as Fury said a cheerful farewell. The extraordinary show is, almost certainly, not quite over. We watched him leave and felt vaguely dazzled by the familiar realisation that, amid all his flaws and contradictions, there is no one else quite like Tyson Fury – in boxing or even in life itself.",Sport/Sport,‘I’m just an average Joe’: He may deny it but there is no one like Tyson Fury,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/24/im-just-an-average-joe-but-there-is-no-one-quite-like-tyson-fury-boxing

His message: that the scandal involving the purchase of tens of thousands of erectile dysfunction tablets by President Jair Bolsonaro’s defense ministry was an intolerable affront. “Carnival is politics too,” said Silva, a 43-year-old psychologist for Brazil’s health service, as he prepared to spend the day denouncing Bolsonaro’s “completely fascist” government by disguising himself as a packet of 50mg impotence pills. Silva was not the only one with politics on his mind this week as bacchanalia gripped Rio’s streets for the first time since February 2020. With a bruising electoral battle for Brazil’s soul less than six months away, many saw carnival as a chance to vent their spleen at Brazil’s far-right president, who retains a ferociously loyal support base but is repudiated by more than half of voters. Loud cries of “Bolsonaro out!” erupted at Rio’s Sambadrome on Friday night as the city’s top samba schools held their first processions since the coronavirus pandemic began. The president’s son, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, was stalked and taunted by angry revellers while trying to watch the parades while a banner demanding his father’s removal was unfurled from one of the stands. Spectators in one of the Sambadrome’s exclusive “luxury boxes” shouted insults about Bolsonaro’s main presidential rival, the former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. But on the working-class terraces and at the roaming street parties known as blocos there was support for Lula. “I feel hopeful because I believe democracy must prevail over authoritarianism – and there’s only one candidate who can achieve this and it’s Lula,” said Angelo Morse, 43, who woke up at 4.30am on Thursday to join a bloco called What a Lovely Wetland. Morse, an educator who claimed to be a distant relative of the North American inventor Samuel FB Morse, came to carnival wearing an alligator costume designed to protest at Bolsonaro’s handling of a Covid outbreak, which has left more than 660,000 Brazilians dead. “President Bolsonaro is a moron and said that if you got vaccinated you’d turn into an alligator,” he said by way of explanation as the square around him filled with inebriated partygoers dressed as pirates, devils, nuns, superheroes, sea creatures and, in one case, a bottle of Heinz Yellow Mustard. One carried a portrait showing Bolsonaro spewing a river of green sewage. On a nearby lawn, the art director Maria Estephania spoke despondently about the social, cultural and economic decline she believed had played out since Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election victory. “We fucked ourselves” by electing Bolsonaro, Estephania, 34, said with a sigh, as she took a break from partying at Liquid Loves, a bloco inspired by the work of the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman. Estephania’s outfit – a scarlet cape plastered with stickers promoting Lula and Marcelo Freixo, a leftist ally she hopes will be elected Rio’s next governor – identified an alternative future. “It’s an election year and we need to reaffirm our values, which bear no relation to those of the political group which currently holds power,” Estephania said. “Our values have absolutely nothing to do with Bolsonaro.” Not everybody wanted to talk politics as carnival returned after a two-year Covid hiatus. At a bloco outside Rio’s Museum of Tomorrow, Eduardo Faria, a portly motorbike courier in a turquoise tutu, busied himself filling a penis-shaped water-pistol with mineral water. “I’m just here to have fun! No politics please!” the 39-year-old giggled. “It’s carnival!” Farther west in Vila Mimosa, Rio’s red light district, another raucous procession was about to begin, led by sex workers and samba musicians. The most modestly dressed partygoer was Everson Almeida, a former seminarist wearing the black cassock he used before ditching plans to join the priesthood. A sticker beneath his clerical collar declared: “Bolsonaro out!” “He’s a sore on our society,” said Almeida, 29, who balked at Bolsonaro’s portrayal of himself as a God-fearing Christian. “Christ came to deliver a message of shelter and inclusion, not segregation, selfishness and conflict.” As the drummers warmed up, Almeida voiced confidence that the Bolsonaro era was entering its final chapter, with Lula leading in the polls. “God willing [he’s finished],” he said, pointing heavenwards. “And this must be what He wants.”",News/World news,‘Carnival is politics’: revellers bring anti-Bolsonaro sentiment to Rio’s streets ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/carnival-is-politics-revellers-bring-anti-bolsonaro-sentiment-to-rios-streets
4/24/2022,"In front of a record crowd for a Red Roses home match of 15,836, England extended their record unbeaten run to 22 with an emphatic victory over Ireland. Even before kick-off the end result was assured. The only challenge England faced was entertaining their fans with a show-stopping performance. In truth, they were only 50% successful. The first half was a difficult watch. One hopes that anyone not yet converted to the women’s game didn’t turn off at the interval. England conceded nine penalties and made eight handling errors across a disjointed 40 minutes and would have been punished had they played against a better resourced team. Ireland deserve credit for turning it into a scrap, but they arrived in Leicester with a mere 282 Test caps among the match-day squad, six less than England’s bench, and were never going to be anything more than a spanner in the works. England spent most of the first half camped inside Ireland’s 22 but did little with their time there. Two mauled tries from lineouts - scored by Lark Davies and Sarah Bern on two and 17 minutes respectively - was all they had to show for their dominance in territory and possession. One spark came from Helena Rowland who was largely a spectator at full-back. She collected a high kick under pressure, beat several tackles with quick steps and burst through two more to make 20 metres. Emily Scarratt, playing her 100th Test, was too eager when cleaning up and gave away a penalty, encapsulating England’s ill-discipline at the breakdown in the opening period. England were ready for the second half early, a tell-tale sign of a rollocking during the interval. Whatever coach Simon Middleton said worked as Marlie Packer completed a slick move in the corner two minutes after the restart. Scarratt made her first successful shot at goal to extend her record England points tally to 655. Ireland’s minuscule hope evaporated when Dorothy Wall was shown yellow for a high tackle on Jess Breach. With a player advantage, Davies scored her second by burrowing from close range. The floodgates opened on 50 minutes when Lydia Thompson capped off a superb first-phase try from a lineout that included a delicious skip-pass from Rowland. Thompson still had work to do but made it look easy, sliding in for her 42nd try in her 52nd match. Poppy Cleall was next on the scorer’s sheet, winning her collision five metres out from the line. Rowland was again heavily involved in the build up before a rumbling maul off a lineout took it close. England’s bench titled the contest further in their favour. A fresh front row kept winning scrum penalties that Zoe Harrison kept nudging into touch. Another lineout maul on the hour dragged replacement Hannah Botterman over. Cleall had another courtesy of a dominant scrum under the Irish posts when she simply had to pick the ball up and fall over the line. Scarratt’s conversion raised the half-century. The last 15 minutes were a procession. Ellie Kildunne scored two stunners from range in either corner and Thompson bagged her brace to complete the 11-try rout. Scarratt was substituted after a head collision with Sene Naoupu that saw the Ireland centre sent off, though she did return before the close. England’s imperious march continues thanks to a brutal second-half display. They’ll be more concerned, though, with what occurred in the first 40 minutes as they prepare for a grand slam finish in France next weekend.",Sport/Sport,England women overwhelm Ireland after change of gear at the break,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/24/england-ireland-womens-six-nations-match-report
4/24/2022,"In 2019, Steven McRae snapped his achilles tendon mid-show. After surgery and intensive rehab he returned to the stage earlier this season and tonight was performing a signature role in Frederick Ashton’s Rhapsody: a bravura showpiece that tests speed, virtuosity, and certainly the strength of one’s achilles.Before that finale, however, two more Ashton works make a triple bill by the Royal Ballet’s founding choreographer. Ashton’s dance is full of playfulness: unexpected combinations, changes of direction, descriptive details in the hands – even in a serious piece such as A Month in the Country, inspired by an Ivan Turgenev play and the standout of the evening. The wonderful, soulful Laura Morera is Petrovna, the listless young wife of an older husband in 19th-century Russia, whose heart leaps at the arrival of her son’s tutor (Vadim Muntagirov), the hopeful spark that makes her glow. Trickily, Petrovna’s ward (Meaghan Grace Hinkis) is infatuated with him also. The emotions of each pas de deux are beautifully delineated, Muntagirov essentially the canvas on which the women project their fantasies of love and escape, while trapped by gender and circumstance like the caged bird in Julia Trevelyan Oman’s grand sepia set. Emotions are on hold in 1948’s fabulously retro Scènes de Ballet, a chic piece of mid-century modern set to Stravinsky, with precisely ruled geometry, pizzicato steps and a touch of melodrama in its sharp gestures. Reece Clarke holds the stage with charismatic stillness and Yasmine Naghdi is so crisp, bright and efficient there’s not a jot of energy wasted. In this and Rhapsody, the ensemble could have been tighter – the choreography demands specificity. In Rhapsody, the corps provide contrast to the daredevil effervescence of the leading man – originally Mikhail Baryshnikov. More recently, McRae has owned this role, exuding confidence and delightful cockiness, darting squirrel-like across the stage as if saying, “Oh this? This is nothing!” It’s a more tentative dancer we meet this time, with a deep knowledge of his body’s incredible capabilities and vulnerabilities. As he gathers pace, he throws himself more fully into it, attacking a chain of revoltades like a warrior. But we see a series of challenges, not pure exaltation that sets the stage alight. It’s not a Hollywood ending, but the next step in a determined dancer’s ongoing journey. At the Royal Opera House, London, until 2 May.",Arts/Stage,Royal Ballet triple bill review – daredevil effervescence and virtuosity,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/24/royal-ballet-triple-bill-review-frederick-ashton-steven-mcrae
