3/21/2022,"Tara is a waitress supporting her widowed mother, alcoholic sister and adored niece with her nugatory wages. Jambo is a 37-year-old man with “mental health” having a birthday pint in the pub and trying to fathom his impoverished life. Hannah is part of a hardworking couple whose zero-hours contract and toddler militate against them finding new accommodation when they are summarily evicted from their one-room home. Gary is the leaseholder of a stall in a market about to be redeveloped who is plunged back into the memories of the slum clearance that broke his mother and his childhood. They form the first four stories in Skint (BBC Four), a series of seven 15-minute monologues (four broadcast this week, three next), overseen by Lisa McGee (the creator and writer of Derry Girls) and the award-winning actor and film-maker Peter Mullan. It follows in the footsteps of the acclaimed CripTales, Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle and Snatches: Moments from Women’s Lives, which used the same form to break down weighty issues (disability, institutionalised racism and endemic sexism, respectively) into individual aspects and examine them in the round. As a television project, it is heartening. The monologues are written and directed by people with direct personal experience of poverty. (For example, the novelist Kerry Hudson, the author of Lowborn, a clear-eyed memoir of her deprived childhood, is the writer of Hannah’s tale of homelessness.) The series’ rubric was to cast and commission as many new faces as possible, creating those all-important first footholds and credits. While some episodes are better than others, it is a uniformly strong lineup: never dull, always vivid and never descending into mere agitprop. They all feel like real glimpses into real lives, providing windows on to realities that are too infrequently (and inaccurately) depicted in drama. The underprivileged and disfranchised appear often in documentaries, of course, but rarely escape a framing as zoological specimens. Skint opens with a piece written by McGee, with Saoirse-Monica Jackson turning the keen edge of madness she brings to Derry Girls to equally fine use as Tara. It is a role that is much closer to tragedy than comedy – which is not to say it is without laughs, black though they are. We meet Tara dressing in borrowed finery as she rails against a customer’s rudeness earlier that day. We begin to understand that this rudeness imperils not just her livelihood, but also the security of those who depend on her. She is as bound by her responsibilities and worries (“how to manage money we just don’t have”) as the customer is … well, I won’t spoil the first twist. She sees almost too clearly to bear how circumscribed her life is, just as her father’s was before her. She says his first question to the doctor, after being diagnosed with cancer, was: “How long will I be able to work?” “I don’t think that’s a question you should have to ask,” says Tara, furiously, opening up the world of generational poverty with a line of dialogue. The lack of any margin of error in poverty and the lack of protection and control over life that it brings are frequent themes, probably best conveyed in the two standout episodes of this week’s batch. No Grasses, No Nonces has a blistering Michael Socha, as Jambo, delivering a monologue filled with rage, despair and bewilderment. The episode, written by Byron Vincent, details and dramatises how the lack of all kinds of resources results in and compounds the effects of sexual abuse, toxic masculinity and grief. It shows how people are left – in their hundreds of thousands – walking around with shattered souls. Gabriel Gbadamosi’s Regeneration takes a more lyrical approach to the scars left by early horrors, dipping in and out of poetry, patois, prose and different periods of time, to no less powerful effect. Gary Beadle plays Gary, simmering with impotent rage, piecing together the fragments of memory and hoping that the one piece of advice his mother left him will be enough to protect him from the uncaring, indifferent powers that be this time round. Next week’s batch comprises The Taking of Balgrayhill Street (written and directed by James Price, with Mullan as a man struggling with pride, shame, nosy neighbours and the need to visit a food bank), Unicorn (by Rachel Trezise, with Tamara Brabon as a young woman being pushed further into poverty by a community-service sentence), and Heart of Glass (written and directed by the novelist Jenni Fagan, with Isis Hainsworth giving an astonishing performance as Mia, a fierce, fragile, hopelessly vulnerable young woman who has left care). They round out an unflinching examination of modern poverty.

3/21/2022,"Boris Johnson will chair a meeting on how to increase the UK’s nuclear power output on Monday, as he prepares to publish his energy security strategy this month amid soaring prices. The prime minister will discuss domestic nuclear projects with leaders from the nuclear industry at a roundtable meeting at Downing Street, No 10 said. Johnson is expected to publish the government’s energy security strategy later in March, against a backdrop of rocketing energy bills, which were already creating a cost of living crisis even before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine led ministers to pledge to phase out Russian energy. The UK generated less than half (43%) of its electricity from renewable sources in 2020, and gas-fired power plants still play a significant role, with Britain reliant on gas for heating as well as electricity. Nuclear power plants currently provide about a sixth of the UK’s electricity. Johnson has previously announced that he intends to remove fossil fuels from UK electricity generation by 2035, and has also argued that the country should invest in more domestic nuclear and renewable energy in order to become more self-sufficient. No 10 officials said topics expected to be discussed at the roundtable meeting include how government and industry can work together to remove barriers and progress future nuclear projects in the UK more quickly and cheaply. Downing Street added that nuclear power is a “safe, clean and reliable energy source”.Last November, the government agreed to invest in a new generation of mini-nuclear reactors, being developed by engineering firm Rolls-Royce. Ministers hope that these small modular reactors, or SMRs, will be quicker and cheaper to build than traditional large-scale nuclear reactors – such as the Hinkley Point C project – which pose considerable construction risks and are often beset by spiralling costs and delays. Johnson told Conservative members at the party’s spring conference in Blackpool over the weekend that the government was going to place some “big bets on nuclear power”, including backing SMRs and larger projects. However, some environmental experts have raised concerns over how to safely dispose of nuclear waste after the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Labour has said it supports building more nuclear sites, and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves called on Sunday for ministers to “get on with the investment in new nuclear”, as well as renewable energy.Johnson is also due to meet executives from the wind sector in the coming days as he looks to bolster domestic energy sources from all available quarters.",News/Business,PM to chair roundtable on boosting UK’s nuclear power output,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output
3/21/2022,"Labour has urged the business secretary to launch legal action against P&O Ferries over its “scandalous” decision to sack 800 workers without warning, which the party said is a criminal offence. Shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, deputy leader Angela Rayner and shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds have written to Kwasi Kwarteng, asking if he will begin proceedings for what they called the “scandalous action” of the ferry company. Under section 193 of the Trade Union Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, employers who want to make more than 100 people redundant have a duty to notify the business secretary of their plans, before giving notice to the workers. The employer is also required to do so at least 45 days before the dismissals. P&O Ferries sacked 800 staff on Thursday, planning to replace them with cheaper agency workers. It has emerged that ministers were informed in advance about the mass redundancies. In their letter to Kwarteng, the Labour MPs wrote: “An employer who fails to provide that notification is committing a criminal offence, and liable to an unlimited fine. It is for you, as secretary of state, to launch that action.” They asked: “Will you be commencing criminal proceedings against P&O Ferries, as well as individual directors and managers as permitted under law? If not, could you explain why?” Labour added: “If an exploitative employer can escape without any consequences for this egregious action, it will give the green light to bad bosses across the country.” Kwarteng wrote to P&O Ferries on Friday, outlining the government’s “anger and disappointment” over the way the company had handled the redundancies. He asked the ferry company a series of questions about why it had failed to follow processes expected of employers dismissing a large number of staff. Kwarteng has given the company until 5pm on Tuesday 22 March to respond before deciding whether to make a formal complaint to the prosecuting authority. Labour and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) are calling on all MPs to back the opposition motion to ban “fire and rehire”, the practice where staff are let go, only to be re-employed on worse terms and conditions. Labour is expected to force an emergency vote on the issue in parliament on Monday. A Commons bill that would have banned the practice was blocked by ministers last October. The government said at the time it opposed such actions, but believed legislation was the wrong way to respond. The TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, called on MPs from all parties to “do the right thing” and support Labour’s motion. “P&O ferries and its owner DP World have acted without shame. We can’t let them off the hook,” she said. “Rogue employers need to know they can’t get away with treating workers like disposable labour.” The TUC has called on ministers to use the growing scandal as a catalyst to improve workers’ rights, by bringing forward an employment bill. O’Grady called on the company to immediately reinstate all sacked staff, without any loss of pay. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, criticised the treatment of workers by the ferry company. “What we are seeing is appalling, the way that they have treated their workers, it is awful, it is wrong,” Sunak said told the BBC on Sunday.He added ministers were examining the company’s actions and whether they complied with regulations on dismissing workers. Employment lawyers reacted with surprise to the company’s move to sack 800 crew out of the blue, and said P&O Ferries may have broken several laws, potentially leaving it open to claims of unfair dismissal. Over the weekend, angry protests were held at ports across the UK. Trade union leaders and politicians joined sacked P&O Ferries workers in Dover, Hull, Liverpool and Larne amid growing rage over the company’s decision, with more protests planned for the coming days, including outside parliament on Monday. On Sunday, P&O warned customers that its services would be “unable to run for the next few days”. The company said it was “advising travellers of alternative arrangements” for its cross-Channel and Irish Sea routes. A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said it had taken the decision to make the staff redundant “as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options”, after it made a £100m loss. “Ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn’t survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies,” they said.",News/Politics,Labour urges Kwasi Kwarteng to launch legal action against P&O Ferries,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/20/labour-urges-kwasi-kwarteng-to-launch-legal-action-against-po-ferries
