3/4/2022,"Australian cricket great Rod Marsh has died, aged 74. The former wicketkeeper suffered a heart attack in Queensland last week and died in Adelaide on Friday. He played the first of his 96 Tests for Australia in 1970 and came to be regarded as one of his country’s greatest players. Marsh called time on his playing career in 1984, hanging up his gloves with what was then a world record of 355 dismissals. After retiring as a player, he oversaw the nation’s cricket academy and later became a selector. Tributes quickly began to pour in for the “legend of a cricketer”. “Sad day with the passing of the great Rod Marsh. His saying, ‘cricket is a simple game made complicated’ still resonates with me. Rod will be missed, thoughts are with his family,” former men’s Test player David Hussey wrote on Twitter. “So sad to hear the news of the passing of Rod Marsh... what a legend of a cricketer, a great bloke who made everyone feel welcome in this great game,” former women’s national team captain Lisa Sthalekar wrote.

3/4/2022,"Museums don’t typically employ crowdsourcing to assemble their exhibitions, but when it came to curating a Carla Zampatti show, Lisa Havilah knew it was the answer. “There was a gap in Carla’s archives when we began sourcing garments from the 60s, 70s and 80s, so we decided to reach out to women across Australia to find work from her early collections,” says Havilah, the chief executive of Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum. Born in Italy, Carla Zampatti was a unique figure in Australian fashion. In a turbulent industry, the designer built an empire over more than half a century, before her death in 2021. The Powerhouse exhibition will be the first major retrospective of her work globally. More than 60 garments from the Zampatti archive and other collections will be on show, along with up to 40 garments and objects selected from public submissions. “Carla’s pieces have been significant in the lives of so many women, often passed down from generation to generation, so we decided to invite people who have loved and collected them to see their garments in the exhibition,” Havilah says. Rare jumpsuits and evening wear from the 1960s and 70s are among the items the Powerhouse is seeking, along with Zampatti-designed Ford Laser cars and “Carla” perfume, key rings and scarves. “I’ve already had so many women reach out to me on Instagram and direct message me about contributing,” says Powerhouse trustee Kellie Hush, who was a close friend of the designer. “One woman in the southern highlands said she had a massive collection, another woman sent me a picture of her in her wedding dress from the 80s and someone else has reached out with a bikini.” People wishing to submit garments are asked to do so by email, including images and details of the pieces such as their location, general condition and any personal stories attached to them. “Our curator will assess the work, then if a piece is accepted, we will cover all the costs of transport and treat it as the very precious object it is,” Havilah says. “We will also invite people to include a story about what it’s meant to them … and we hope to expand our own Carla Zampatti collection through acquiring some garments as well.” Havilah began developing the exhibition with Zampatti in 2019, after she was appointed as the chief executive of the Powerhouse. “We started talking about what work was available from her own collection, but we also talked about telling her broader story in the community,” she says. “Carla cared so much about cultural diversity and the role of the arts in our lives, and she was an active philanthropist and businesswoman.” Since the designer’s death, the Powerhouse has been working closely with her family and fashion business on the show.

The Powerhouse is currently seeking garment submissions for the exhibition.",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘Significant in the lives of so many women’: Carla Zampatti retrospective crowdsources a legacy,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/04/significant-in-the-lives-of-so-many-women-carla-zampatti-retrospective-crowdsources-a-legacy
