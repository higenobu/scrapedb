4/15/2022,"The first animal to be buried in an elaborate grave at Casa Rosa, the oldest pet cemetery in Italy, was a beloved chicken belonging to the sons of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Word of its existence soon spread among the Italian elite, and before long the cemetery was hosting the remains of cats and dogs owned by the country’s former royals and a variety of other VIP pets, including hamsters, rabbits, pigeons and lions belonging to politicians, magistrates and film directors. The French actor, Brigitte Bardot, who was in Rome in the 1950s to film Il Disprezzo (Contempt), also laid her dog, Michael, to rest at Casa Rosa, tucked away in a quiet spot in the Portuense area of the Italian capital. Today, the cemetery hosts about 1,000 graves, each with headstones featuring a photo of the pet, tender inscriptions and surrounded by flowers, figurines or teddy bears. As demand for a dignified resting place for domestic animals grows, authorities in Rome’s administrative region, Lazio, are seeking to replicate it . Casa Rosa was founded by Antonio Molon – a vet who took care of Mussolini’s Great Danes – in 1922, the year the dictator took power. The cemetery, an area of land next to the Molon family home, is now run by his son, Luigi. “At that time, they sold coloured baby chickens at trade fairs, it was an old custom,” said Luigi Molon. “There were these three chicks [that Mussolini bought], two died straight away and one became a playmate for his sons. After a while, she died too and Mussolini, knowing that my dad had a piece of land, asked if the chicken could be buried there – somewhere his sons could visit, leave a flower and recall happy times.” Although cemeteries akin to Casa Rosa exist in other regions of Italy, in Lazio there is no specific law that permits them. Casa Rosa operates thanks to a licence granted by the council in Rome, last renewed in 1984, and because it has land suitable for burying animals. So unless a pet owner has a patch of land, say a back garden, deemed appropriate, then they have no choice but to have the animal cremated. “For example, if there’s an underground aquifer, you can’t bury your animals as you would pollute everything,” said Molon. “We are the only ones with a licence.” Some of those who miss out on a coveted spot for their pets at Casa Rosa end up seeking burial plots beyond Lazio. But that could be about to change. Regional politicians with the Five Star Movement are working on a proposal that would allow the creation of cemeteries dedicated to the burial of domestic animals. The goal is to guarantee respectable burials while ensuring animals are interred in a secure and controlled way. “This means the remains of the animals will no longer be disposed of as waste, reducing the risk of polluting aquifers due to unauthorised burials and of spreading disease in the event of remains being thrown into rubbish bins,” the politicians said in a statement. “It would be a civilised law, one that we owe to ourselves and, above all, to our four-legged friends in order not to break the bond that was created in life.” Molon said the law was needed, adding he was overwhelmed by demand, mainly from the well-heeled faction of Lazio’s society. “They are in immense pain and have no sense of time, sometimes calling at 2am, but what can I do? I can’t come and collect the dog at that hour,” he said. “Some people live alone and previously you might have put such a strong bond with an animal down to that, but nowadays pets really are an important component of a family.” Generally, burial plots at Casa Rosa are rented for five years, although many pet owners choose to renew, visiting regularly to tend to the grave and leave flowers. “Some come every day,” said Molon. “It’s as if they’re taking their pet for a walk.” Greta, a lion, has been there since 1988. Close by is Duchessa, a cat who died in 2008. On her tombstone is a message that reads: “In our hearts and minds forever”. The most opulent grave belongs to Dreys, a dog whose remains are covered with a black marble grave ledger that cost €12,000, while perhaps the most unusual animal buried at Casa Rosa is a tortoise called Ruga. Molon said Mussolini’s granddaughter, Alessandra, visited the cemetery up until a few years ago, even if the chicken’s plot is no longer there. While Molon, who has two dogs, fully understands the affection owners have for their pets, he acknowledges that some of his customers are perhaps “a little extreme”. “They don’t know the difference between reality and fantasy … they prefer to speak to a dog rather than a human being because the dog doesn’t talk back.” He said he is passionate about his job, even if some people “turn their noses up” at it. “I love animals… but I also love people.”",News/World news,Casa Rosa: inside Italy’s oldest pet cemetery ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/casa-rosa-where-benito-bardot-and-italy-elite-lay-their-pets-to-rest
4/15/2022,"In the opening scenes of Pelin Esmer’s heartwarming documentary, the sublime and the quotidian are beautifully intertwined. The tranquil sight of a group of older women enjoying a seaside dip is juxtaposed with a striking view of the Roman amphitheatre overlooking the deep blue ocean. Unassuming in appearance, the women quickly transform into thespians, taking over the ancient site and making it a rehearsal space for an amateur production of King Lear. Coming from an impoverished rural background, this unlikely peasant-women theatre troupe brings the magic of Shakespeare to remote Turkish villages where even the basic staple of drinking-water is nonexistent. Their performances often take place on school playgrounds, and are rudimentary in terms of costuming and staging. Wearing their own clothes, the women give Shakespeare a regional otherworldliness. And alongside the evident communal pleasure inspired by such events, the off-stage interactions between the performers and the villagers are equally fascinating. Zeynep, who plays Lear, confides her youthful hope of becoming a nurse, which was was quickly quashed by her father’s order that she must stick to raising goats. Performing has ignited a transformative sense of confidence in Zeynep, however. And the young girl she confides in has her own dream of teaching, though her future seems uncertain. The film’s freewheeling structure makes for a great intimacy with its subjects but it doesn’t help the viewer with the physical orientation of events, especially not those unfamiliar with the local geography. However, though modest in terms of visuals and scope, Queen Lear is an endearing ode to the collective power of art and a subtle call for gender equality in Turkey.  Queen Lear is available on 18 April on True Story.",Arts/Film,Queen Lear review – all-female acting troupe do a village Shakespeare,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/queen-lear-review-ode-to-the-collective-power-of-art-turkey
4/15/2022,"The battle to buy Chelsea is down to three candidates after the consortium led by the Ricketts family withdrew from the running on Friday. In a statement the group said: “The Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert Group has decided, after careful consideration, not to submit a final bid for Chelsea F.C. In the process of finalising their proposal, it became increasingly clear that certain issues could not be addressed given the unusual dynamics around the sales process. We have great admiration for Chelsea and its fans, and we wish the new owners well.” Chelsea fans have opposed the bid in significant numbers over historical accusations of Islamophobia, including with a protest at Stamford Bridge. The Ricketts family has said it “rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms” and sources said supporter opposition was not behind the withdrawal and that the move came because the consortium’s three partners could not agree on the structure of the bid. The Ricketts had partnered with the hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin and Rock Entertainment Group, which is headed by Dan Gilbert, who is worth an estimated $31bn (£23.7bn). The Ricketts said they had planned to add Karan Bilimoria, a Tory peer, Chelsea fan and the founder of Cobra Beer, to the board. Final offers to buy Chelsea had to be submitted on Thursday and a preferred bidder could be selected next week. Those remaining in contention are a consortium led by the co-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly; a consortium fronted by Sir Martin Broughton and Sebastian Coe that has received backing from the owners of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, Josh Harris and David Blitzer; and a bid led by the Boston Celtics’ co-owner Steve Pagliuca. The merits of each offer are being assessed by Roman Abramovich and Chelsea’s board, and Raine, the American bank handling the sale, will take a preferred bidder to the UK government for approval.",Sport/Football,Chelsea takeover: Ricketts family’s consortium withdraws from race,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/chelsea-takeover-ricketts-family-consortium-withdraws-from-race
4/15/2022,"The unprecedented wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats from European capitals – now close to 400 – is not just a symbolic, if reversible, act of revulsion at the war crimes for which Russia stands accused. It is part of a decades long battle to police the dividing line between espionage and diplomacy, one in which the west of late has been accused of too often ignoring a resurgence in Russia’s clandestine activities, either because of an excessive focus on domestic terrorism, or excessive reliance on intercepts. Sir John Sawers, the former head of M16, last year said he suspected the west was picking up only 10% of Russia’s espionage. The current scale of the exodus of alleged Russian spies – probably the largest single set of such expulsions in history according to the distinguished former French diplomat François Heisbourg – may also raise questions about why the west came to indulge so many Russian “diplomats” working on European soil. By Friday, among the EU member states, only Malta, Cyprus and Hungary had so far declined to send any Russian “diplomats” packing. Heisbourg insisted there was a clear and valid distinction between a diplomat and a spy, and those being expelled from Europe will not be chosen at random but because there is evidence they are in breach of the Vienna convention, the code that governs legitimate diplomacy. As well as spying this could also involve spreading disinformation on social media. “If you spend your time sending Twitter messages insulting the government of the host nation, if you follow the ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy undertaken by Chinese diplomats, that can fall under that definition of making you persona non grata,” said Heisbourg. Heisbourg said there was an art to expulsions. “Self-evidently, it is easier to keep track of the spy that you do know rather than the spy you don’t know. Once you know of their existence, they become useful counter-intelligence. If you don’t know who they are you have a problem.” He recalled that during the so-called Farewell affair in the 1980s a KGB defector, Vladimir Vetrov, gave almost 4,000 secret documents to the DST, the French internal secret service, showing how Russia had penetrated the west to steal its technology. Vetrov also provided a list of 250 intelligence officers stationed under legal cover in embassies around the world. It was only following Vetrov’s arrest in Moscow that France, acting on the dossiers Vetrov provided, acted to expel 40 diplomats, two journalists and five commercial officials. Heisbourg had a role in handling the case and recalled: “Even then, it was useful to keep some names back so we had an A list and a B list that we kept in reserve in case the Russians should take countervailing action. We made it known to the Russians that if they did a tit for tat, they would get hit again many times bigger.” Since the 1980s Heisbourg said he had little doubt that the proportion of spies operating inside the Russian diplomatic service was higher than for most countries. It raises questions, for instance, why 290 Russian diplomats will still be operating in neutral Austria even after the foreign ministry, following days of hesitation, expelled four diplomats. By way of comparison, Austria has about 30 diplomats operating in Moscow. It is true large countries have larger embassies – a prime example is the US embassy in Baghdad – and some of the Russian diplomats in Vienna – possibly 100 – are attached to the many UN institutions in Austria, such as the UN nuclear watchdog the IAEA. But the imbalance of Russian and Austrian interest in one another’s countries is, at best, striking. Poland too may, in retrospect, be wondering why after expelling 45 diplomats on 23 March, it had ever granted diplomatic status to so many Russians in the first place. Stanisław Żaryn, spokesperson for the minister for the special services coordinator, has justified the expulsions by saying “we are neutralising the Russian special services network in our country”, adding that half the expelled diplomats were direct employees of the Russian secret service and half were involved in hostile influence operations. “Russia uses diplomacy not to remain in contact with partners, but to push false claims and false propaganda statements against the west,” Żaryn said. In total, the 45 Russians being thrown out represent about half the Russian diplomatic staff in Warsaw. Poland also saw the expulsions as a preventive measure. The risk of espionage had risen with the sudden influx of Ukrainians into Poland, potential fertile ground for Russia to stir dissent, recruit agents or pick up information from refugees about military movements. Russia, Żaryn claimed, was intent on “creating hostility within Poland towards Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia”. Poland is now seizing disused old Russian embassy buildings in Warsaw. Two other countries at the forefront of providing heavy arms to Ukraine – Slovakia and the Czech Republic – have also recently been on the espionage front line with Moscow. On 30 March, Bratislava expelled 35 diplomats, one of the largest single expulsions in the current wave. Only a fortnight before on 14 March Slovakia detained four people suspected of spying for Moscow, and expelled three Russian diplomats in response. Russia had paid the suspects “tens of thousands of euros” for sensitive or classified information. The quality of that information is disputed, but one of the two men charged was pro-rector and the head of the security and defence department at the Armed Forces Academy in the northern town of Liptovsky Mikulas. It has been reported there was evidence of contacts with four officers working for Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency dating to 2013. One of them was Lt Col Sergey Solomasov, a GRU spy. Slovak intelligence filmed Solomasov smoking and talking in a park with Bohuš Garbár, a contributor to a now closed conspiracy website Hlavné Správy. On the video he tells Garbár: “Moscow has decided that you will be a ‘hunter’ for two types of people: those who love Russia and would like to cooperate, who want money, and have confidential information. The second group are your acquaintances who may or may not be thinking about working for Russia. I need political information and communication between countries, within Nato and the EU.” The lines may not be purist Ian Fleming prose, but in an era of technology based espionage, they show spies still depend on a mundane individual’s avarice and mendacity. The Czechs also have reason to doubt the bona fides of Russian diplomat. In 2014 a mysterious but massive explosion occurred at a couple of remote Czech weapons warehouses, including one in Vrbětice close to the border with Slovakia that led to two deaths. At the time Ukraine had been in the market for weapons to fight Russia in Donbas. It was not clear if the cause of the explosions was sabotage or incompetence, and the case went cold. But then investigations by the British police, as well as the open-source investigative news outlet Bellingcat, revealed the identity of two suspected GRU agents. The two were Ruslan Boshirov (real name Anatoliy Chepiga) and Alexander Petrov (Alexander Mishkin). These exact same aliases had been allegedly given by two Russians who had visited a hotel near Vrbětice just before the 2014 explosion. Intelligence sources suggested that the planned arms shipments belonged to EMCO, a firm owned by the Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev, who was poisoned in an upscale Sofia restaurant in April 2015, just months after the explosion in the Czech Republic. An investigation in 2019 by Bellingcat asserted that another senior GRU officer, Denis Sergeev (aka “Sergey Fedotov”), was in Bulgaria at the time of Gebrev’s poisoning, which he survived. Sergeev is also alleged to have been in the UK around the time of the the novichok poisoning attacks on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. None of this activity, the Czechs concluded, would have occurred without the knowledge of the Russian state. In April last year the then Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš ordered the expulsion of 18 Russian diplomats, asserting GRU Unit 29155 had been behind the destruction of the weapons. Russia retaliated by expelling 20 Czechs, only for the Czechs to increase the expulsions to 60 so equalising the size of the two countries’ diplomatic missions. It was one of the largest single expulsions of Russian diplomats since Ronald Reagan threw out 80 diplomats in 1986 at the height of the cold war. Prague has often been described as a hub for Russian espionage activity across Europe, but no longer. Not surprisingly after the diplomatic carnage of 2021, the Czechs have this spring only expelled one Russian diplomat. In the same vein, Heisbourg said, most European countries are not critical of the British failure to expel diplomats in the wake of “the Bucha massacre”. After throwing out 29 Russian diplomats in the wake of the Skripal poisoning in 2019, Russia’s London embassy is relatively clean, and the UK is anyway reluctant to take a step that would see yet more of its Russian-speaking envoys – a precious resource – sent home from Moscow. But the contrast between the UK and European response has been striking. After the war crimes in Bucha were revealed Germany expelled 40 Russian diplomats, France 35, Spain 25, Slovenia 33, Italy – which had thrown out two Russian spies in 2021 – selected a further 30. France for mysterious reasons then threw out a further six diplomats. Lithuania decided to expel Alexey Isakov, the Russian ambassador himself. As a farewell present someone dyed the lake in front of the embassy blood red. Some, such as Belgium (expelled 21) and the Netherlands (17) took action before news of the Bucha massacre started to circulate. Others agonised. Luxembourg expelled only one Russian, but since there were only three Russian diplomats, it was more than symbolic. A strong theme has been less that the diplomats were spies, but that they were agents of division and disinformation. The German foreign ministry for instance declared 40 persona non grata in the Russian embassy because “they have worked against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society, day after day here in Germany”. Spain simply said the 25 represented a threat to the interests and security of their country. Other European countries have justified the expulsions on grounds of parity. The Slovenian foreign ministry for instance cited article 11 of the Vienna convention. That article confers the receiving state the right to require the foreign diplomatic mission or consular post to keep the size of its mission within reasonable and normal limits. So Slovenia aligned the size of Russia diplomatic mission with its own in Moscow. Since Slovenia has only eight diplomats in Moscow, 33 of the 41 Russian embassy staff in Slovenia have been asked to leave the country. For good measure it has demanded Moscow pay compensation for a Russia missile damaging its mission in Kharkiv. There have also been some curiosities. Austria’s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, said at the beginning of last week he opposed expulsions and insisted Austria needed its eyes and ears. “We do not expel in bulk,” he said grandly, adding the lack of coordination across Europe was regrettable. But by Thursday he executed an inelegant U-turn. One possible reason for the volte face was the re-emergence of stories recalling how Austria’s scandal ridden Federal Agency for State Protection and Counterterrorism (BVT) had been excluded from European intelligence sharing for a while because it was considered deeply compromised. Another curio has been Sweden. Neighbouring Denmark identified 15 Russian intelligence officers to throw out. The Swedish Security Service (Säpo) last year informed its foreign ministry that one in three Russian representatives in Sweden was in reality a spy, meaning 11 or 12 Russians working in the 35-strong embassy were spies, yet only three were expelled. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, has been one of many to ask what was holding Sweden back. Foreign ministries are reluctant to expel, unless the evidence is overwhelming. Diplomats naturally believe in their profession and so regard experts in situ with first hand contacts as vital to conveying accurate information about their host country back to their capital. They also reduce the risks of misunderstandings. This benign take on the value of diplomacy with Russian is becoming a minority view. Even in neutral Ireland, there has been a change in perspective about the 31 Russian diplomats operating in the country. Some of it goes back to 2015 when the Russian embassy in Dublin received planning permission to put new buildings on its 2 hectare (5 acre) site including a large underground building, labelled on the planning application as for storage and plant use. It took a special meeting of the Irish government in March 2020 to reinterpret what was about to be constructed, and to revoke planning permission. Keir Giles, senior consultant to the Chatham House Russia programme, explained: “Spies do not always operate in the country in which they are based. They once operated from a base in Chamonix, for instance, and there was clear risk Ireland was to be their spying headquarters for its European operations. They may have needed somewhere after so many had been thrown out [of the UK] following Skripal. The problem is Russia deters by operating in an asymmetrical way. You either respond in kind or you back down. We throw out spies and they throw out diplomats.” For instance when eight Russian diplomats attached to Nato headquarters in Brussels were thrown out in October 2021, Russia did not just reciprocate, it shut down its whole Nato mission and shut down the Nato information office in Moscow. Meetings of the Nato-Russia Council, the main consultation body between Moscow and the west, were postponed. Now with every day the estrangement seems to grow more profound. Visa requirements become tougher. More than 600 of 800 surveyed western companies have announced they are curtailing activities in Russia beyond what is required by international sanctions, according to a survey by Yale Management. Free media is disappearing, and VPN sites blocked, forcing the west and Russia deeper into their separate information bubbles. Germany will eventually wean itself off Russian energy permanently, curtailing a whole network of business, institutional and cultural links that have developed since the 1970s. Few think that it is a decoupling that can be reversed for decades to come.",News/World news,Spy games: expulsion of diplomats shines light on Russian espionage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/spy-russian-diplomats-europe-espionage-ukraine
4/15/2022,"The server’s end-of-dinner offer at Lisboeta had all the hallmarks of the chef. “Nuno would love you to try the pork-fat custard with a port caramel,” he said, in a manner that suggested chef-patron Nuno Mendes, the kind-eyed disrupter of Portuguese food in Britain, had left me no real option. I did not want the pork-fat custard. I wasn’t entirely sure, earlier in the meal, that I wanted the razor clam and blood sausage on toast – it tasted like musky armpit – but in both cases I found myself nodding in acceptance, because Mendes’ restaurants are always a wild and educational ride. He has become famous and loved in the British food scene over the past decade for a shaggy, avuncular charm that masks a fervent mischief in his cooking, plus a noble urge to chivvy Britain past the piri piri and pastel de nata approach to Portugal. If Mendes did crack one day and simply dish up spicy chicken, croquettes and octopus, he would probably be richer than God, yet instead he persists with the likes of cured, room-temperature slivers of amberjack topped with orange and onion, or wild mushrooms in egg-yolk bread sauce alongside plates of pungent sheep’s cheese from Serra da Arrábida. And lest everything, to the British palate anyway, be a little wobbly and unstructured, there is Coombeshead Farm bread with vivid-pink, whipped pork fat to mop one’s plate. Each dish at Lisboeta comes with a story from each server about their mother or grandmother or great aunt who cooked this very egg-yolk sauce or lamb chanfana stew every Sunday, because Mendes has created a slice of deeply personal Portugal here, and the staff can’t help themselves. So as you begin the chanfana - a dark bowl of lamb shoulder slow-cooked in red wine with turnip tops and chunks of bread – they approach to recount tales of their childhood. The emotion is sort of exhausting, but Grace Jones and the Clash were playing loudly in the bathroom, so I hid in there occasionally. On a Monday night, in mid-spring, Lisboeta was jam-packed, because wherever Mendes goes, the food crowd follows. He was once the chef at Chiltern Firehouse, a sort of celebrity safari park, which I always thought was a peculiar fit, because Mendes really cared about cooking and the clientele cared only about staring at each other’s table and hoping to seeing Romeo Beckham or Lindsay Lohan. Mendes was bringing the intensity of Ferran Adrià – whom he cites as an influence – and his clientele were pushing salad leaves around the plate while uploading toilet selfies. Mendes then opened Viajante, where diners first saw his real passion for showcasing Portugal, but with Japanese, Iberian and South American influences. Later, at Mãos, he offered an intense, three-hour, seasonal tasting menu to only 16 people at a time. Lisboeta, by comparison, feels like a breezier, more down-to-earth space. It isn’t remotely cheap: that very delicious, deeply satisfying lamb stew is £44, to serve two, although a single hungry person could easily demolish it; a side of charlotte potatoes is a further £6. A delightful, crumbly Goan-spiced pork pie is as big as a baby’s palm and comes in at £3 a mouthful. However, as rents and bills increase in restaurants, I am growing inured to dishes being stretched, styled and described to feel much larger than they are once you remove the leaves and garnish. At Lisboeta, there are hits and misses, but I certainly left more learned on authentic Portuguese dining. Do I like the wobbly, porky, milky, egg yolk custard on a bed of blood-red port caramel? Not especially. It tastes precisely as it sounds: like a bacony Bird’s trifle. But do I support Mendes’ indefatigable urge to serve it? Yes, I do. With all my heart. It’s tough out there for mavericks right now, and we have to applaud them. Even if the bacalhau à brás – confit cod with caramelised onion and potato – tastes the same as one of those 1980s cod portions that we boiled in bags. Despite all these things, Lisboeta is an intimate, gently challenging attempt to bring the vibrant traditions of Portugal to UK palates, with Mendes at the helm offering his typical twinkly-eyed tricks. There are much worse places to order a white port and tonic and half a dozen pork pies as you watch the London food scene waltz past. The service is charming and prompt, the music is great and Mendes will most likely be behind the pass, because it’s beyond doubt that, when it comes to his restaurants, he cares deeply. His pork custard will most definitely be cited on end-of-2022 restaurant round-ups. And rightfully so. It was unforgettable.  Lisboeta, 30 Charlotte Street, London W1, 020-3830 9888.

4/15/2022,"City on Fire by Don Winslow (HarperCollins, £20)This first book in a projected trilogy about warring mobster families is set in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1986. The Italians and the Irish have carved up the city, existing in relative harmony while controlling the trucking industry and the docks. The author makes overt comparisons with the Iliad, and modern-day Helen of Troy Pam provides a convenient excuse for a bunch of men trapped in a cycle of violence to embark on a disastrous feud, although this time it’s due to a drunken grope rather than divine intervention. In the middle of it all is docker Danny Ryan, his dreams of escape stymied by his family connection to the Murphy clan, for whom he occasionally works; Danny now finds himself embroiled in the conflict. Winslow’s previous “Cartel” trilogy is an astonishing achievement that will be hard to beat, but on the strength of this immersive and humane tale of fate, free will, loyalty and betrayal, his new series will rank alongside it. A Tidy Ending by Joanna Cannon (Borough, £16.99)Cannon uses her chosen milieu – the suburban street where curtains twitch, the chintzy cheeriness of the old folk’s home, quotidian tragedies and buried truths – to explore the inner lives of outsiders. In her third novel, 43-year-old Linda takes centre stage: a socially awkward mixture of naive and sly, she was already the odd-girl-out at school when her piano teacher father’s inappropriate behaviour towards young students meant she and her mother had to leave town, and she has never come to terms with what happened. Her adult life is an endless round of cleaning, cooking and stints in a charity shop. While husband Terry spends his free time in front of the television, she dreams over the upmarket catalogues that arrive for the house’s previous occupant, Rebecca, whom she decides to find and befriend. Meanwhile, neighbourhood gossip is in overdrive because local girls have been going missing. Compellingly creepy, with precisely observed characterisation, A Tidy Ending combines pathos with lovely flashes of humour and a wholly unexpected ending. Say Her Name by Dreda Say Mitchell and Ryan Carter (Thomas & Mercer, £8.99)Adopted as an eight-year-old by Cherry and Carlton “Sugar” McNeil, Eva, a woman of dual heritage, decides to track down her birth parents after Cherry’s death and her suspension, on spurious grounds, from her work as a hospital doctor. Eva’s white father, a rich businessman, is easily found – although he may not be all that he seems and she, still emotionally raw, is gullible – but her mother proves more elusive. Ex-police officer Sugar seems to know more than he is letting on and is evasive when asked why he left the force. Eva’s journey takes her back to 1994 and the disappearance – barely acknowledged by the police, let alone the media – of four Black women … Mystery novels can be good vehicles for examining social issues and Mitchell and Carter do an excellent job, providing an engrossing narrative as well as a heartfelt and eloquent exploration of the iniquities of racial bias in cases where women go missing. Miss Aldridge Regrets by Louise Hare (HQ, £14.99)Lena Aldridge, narrator of Hare’s second novel, is also of dual heritage, and the person missing from her life is her white mother, who left her to be brought up by her impecunious musician father. In 1936, Lena is singing in a seedy nightspot in London’s Soho when its owner – also the cheating husband of her best friend – is murdered; she decides to take up an out-of-the-blue offer of a first-class ticket on the Queen Mary and a role in a Broadway show. Lena may have her secrets – not only has she disposed of evidence from the murder, but she, is also “passing” for white – but when she becomes involved with the wealthy, dysfunctional Abernathy family and people start dying, she realises that there might be more to her lucky break than she’d imagined. Short, unnecessary sections in “murderer’s italics” are an irritant, but the conflicted, appealing heroine and Christie-type mystery make this an engrossing read. Three Assassins by Kotaro Isaka, translated by Sam Malissa (Harvill Secker, £14.99)First published in Japan in 2004, Three Assassins is, in many respects, an odd book. Suzuki is seeking revenge for the deliberate hit-and-run killing of his wife by the “idiot son” of the leader of Fräulein, a criminal organisation so comprehensive in the evil it does that, he notes, “the more that’s revealed to him the more improbable it all seems”.

Spurs will almost definitely dispatch a Brighton side that embarrassed Arsenal last time out so to keep pace they simply have to beat Southampton. Fortunately they face a Saints side without a win in five matches so if Arsenal show up and play with an ounce of positivity then Ralph Hasenhüttl’s usual forward-thinking approach should allow for plenty of chances. Chances that have so often gone unfinished this season however. Southampton have hope to end their poor run with Arsenal’s profligate nature only likely to improve once the transfer window opens.

4/15/2022,"For the past couple of years, I’ve been working with researchers in northern Greece who are farming metal. In a remote, beautiful field, high in the Pindus mountains in Epirus, they are experimenting with a trio of shrubs known to scientists as “hyperaccumulators”: plants which have evolved the capacity to thrive in naturally metal-rich soils that are toxic to most other kinds of life. They do this by drawing the metal out of the ground and storing it in their leaves and stems, where it can be harvested like any other crop. As well as providing a source for rare metals – in this case nickel, although hyperaccumulators have been found for zinc, aluminium, cadmium and many other metals, including gold – these plants actively benefit the earth by remediating the soil, making it suitable for growing other crops, and by sequestering carbon in their roots. One day, they might supplant more destructive and polluting forms of mining. The three plants being tested in Greece – part of a network of research plots across Europe – are endemic to the region. Alyssum murale, which grows in low bushes topped by bunches of yellow flowers, is native to Albania and northern Greece; Leptoplax emarginata – taller and spindlier, with clusters of green leaves and white petals – is found only in Greece; and Bornmuellera tymphaea, the most efficient of the three, which straggles across the ground in a dense layer of white blossom, is found only on the slopes of the Pindus (its name comes from Mount Tymfi, one of the highest peaks of the range). What I have come to understand about these plants is that, by virtue of their evolutionary history and their close association with the soil, climate and wider ecosystem in which they have emerged, they embody a certain kind of knowledge: an understanding and accommodation with the places they have found themselves in. Humans have sought out deposits of rare metals for thousands of years, and developed ever-more violent ways of accessing them, but these plants have been around far longer, and have found more equitable and regenerative ways of doing much the same thing. Perhaps we have something to learn from them. Hyperaccumulators are far from being the only non-humans that we might learn from, as scientific research in recent decades has shown us. Take slime moulds: strange, unicellular creatures somewhere between fungi and amoebae, which turn out to be very good at solving some very hard mathematical problems. Researchers at Lanzhou University in China have shown that Physarum polycephalum, a particularly lively slime mould, can solve the “travelling salesman” problem – a test for finding the shortest route between multiple cities – faster and more efficiently than any supercomputer humans have devised. Cows, sheep, dogs and other animals have been shown to predict earthquakes in advance of tremors which register on seismographs. Squids and octopuses, we have learned, spread their neurons out through their bodies in ways that allow their limbs, and perhaps other faculties, to act independently of a centrally controlling mind. Spiders store information in their webs, using them as a kind of extended cognition: a mind outside the body entirely. A new conception of intelligence is emerging from scientific research: rather than human intelligence being unique or the peak of some graduated curve, there appear to be many different kinds of intelligence with their own strengths, competencies and suitabilities. We’re also discovering all kinds of abilities which suggest whole worlds of being and awareness among non-humans we were previously unaware of. Plants, it turns out, hear and remember. In one experiment, they demonstrated the ability to respond with chemical defences to the particular sound of caterpillars munching on their leaves, even when it came from a tape recorder. In another, mimosa plants – which curl their leaves up when disturbed – learned to ignore being dropped a short distance when it proved harmless, and to react in the same way when tested days or weeks later, having in some way internalised this experience. Meanwhile, beneath the forest floor, we have become privy to the commerce and conversations of trees as they trade nutrients and information between families and species through the networks of fungi which connect their roots, in ways we are only just beginning to understand. These, too, are kinds of intelligence: and among other things, they are the way other species have learned to survive life-threatening events. In the struggle to mitigate and adapt to climate breakdown – and all the other entangled crises we face – we are starting to recognise that other ways of knowing and acting on the world, from indigenous knowledge systems to changes in our own consumption and patterns of life, are vital to surviving and thriving on a hotter, wetter and more conflicted planet. We know too that this survival is dependent not only on our own abilities and inventions, but on the survival of the other species we share the planet with. The collapse of biodiversity which is already occurring makes it harder for us to hold back the collapse of whole ecosystems on which we too depend: for the pollination of crops, for disease resistance, for safe and sufficient food, for protection from fires and other natural disasters. We will flourish together, or not at all. The deep knowledge that is possessed by animals, plants and others – their intelligence, we should begin to say – is another reason why we must preserve and protect them. But more than this: we should be listening to them, learning from them and working with them. The hyperaccumulator plants, for example, show us there are other ways of getting what we need from the planet; they also remind us that there are limits to what we should extract, as to turn them into another agroindustrial resource like soya beans or palm oil would be just as damaging. The knowledge that there are other ways of being intelligent on this planet should force us to reassess the centrality and usefulness of our own. Other worlds are not only possible, they have been growing around us all along.

4/15/2022,"Corsets, bustles, satins and ruffles: the Gilded Age’s fashion comeback could soon be complete after American Vogue announced it as this year’s theme for New York’s Met Gala. This season’s flirtation with the corset trend is an experiment few are yet to try in earnest, but we could be eating our words next month after the Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, invited A-listers to arrive at fashion’s biggest night “embodying the grandeur – and perhaps the dichotomy – of Gilded Age New York”. During the Gilded Age, a time of rapid economic growth in the US from the 1870s to the 1900s, society queens poured themselves into extravagantly embellished and corseted couture gowns. As “Regencycore” breaks free from being a TikTok trend to go truly mainstream – aided in part by two big-budget television programmes – society’s finest are set to bring it into the 21st century. Julian Fellowes’s recent HBO series The Gilded Age mesmerised viewers with spectacularly grand costumes, for which actor Louisa Jacobson admitted to having to take “corset breaks”. Our fixation with Bridgerton’s bodicing is being catered for in retail – Asos reports that it has sold, on average, three corsets every minute this year – while #Regencycore has had 32.9m views on TikTok. Television programmes aside, it is uncertain why the period, in which a select few became unimaginably rich through rapid technological advancement, has had such a resurgence. But aesthetically, the theme makes perfect sense in a post-Covid world, according to the author and Central Saint Martins fashion lecturer Harriet Worsley. “It’s a real celebration of glamour; it’s incredibly positive,” she said. Such a “nostalgic return to womanly extremes” is a timely antidote, she added, “after everyone’s been living in their ‘straight up and down’ pyjamas, people want to look sexy after all this undersexed androgyny.” Perhaps the ultimate transformation from baggy joggers to pin-up was Billie Eilish’s internet-breaking Vogue cover last summer. But Patricia Maeda, the director of womenswear at trend forecasting agency Fashion Snoops, believes the Met Gala will aid the corset in entering the mainstream – making it part of the fashion landscape in the way skinny jeans have been. “Compared with other red carpets such as the Oscars, Golden Globes, etc, the Met Gala reigns supreme in terms of fashion influence,” she said. “Clearly there is a lot of research that goes into deciding the theme for the exhibit and its relevance within the fashion industry.” On the fashion shopping app Lyst, where searches for corsets have risen by 85% over the last three months, these searches are most often combined with the words “lace”, “leather” and “black” – suggesting they are currently eveningwear. Maeda believes there will be “new iterations of the corset, featuring softer fabrics and flexible boning” without all the usual constraints, thus offering a broader appeal. Hybrid versions are expected for autumn, with “Fendi shirts that incorporate structured boning, and coats and blazers with corset details from Dior and Versace”. A corset that optimises a woman’s form, rather than subjugates it, is a welcome development. Some have criticised the Gilded Age theme, with the fashion influencer Bryanboy tweeting “Golden glamour in times of war, let them eat cake”. However, Maeda believes the point is to illustrate that “fashion can always provide us an escapist outlet to break free from our current reality, whether through Regency period style or a glamorous red carpet event”.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Gilded Age corsets poised to make the next fashion breakthrough,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/15/gilded-age-corsets-poised-to-make-the-next-fashion-breakthrough
4/15/2022,"‘Why is everyone struggling in New York?” Hannah Hovarth asks in season one of HBO’s coming-of-age comedy-drama Girls. Back in 2012, it was a question that – to fans and the many journalists who gave the show rave reviews – felt very fresh. Lena Dunham’s look at the trials and tribulations that come with adulthood in the Big Apple – which launched 10 years ago today – wasn’t the first of its kind. But while shows such as Sex and the City – and its all-Black counterpart Girlfriends – had explored similar ground 10 years earlier, there was something about Girls that felt different. “If Sex in the City is the celebration of a post-90s feminism that celebrates money, consumption, sex and over-the-top feminity, Girls is the rejection of that,” says Jorie Lagerwey, professor of english, drama and film at University College Dublin and author of Horrible White People; Gender, Genre and Television’s Precarious Whiteness. It was an unflinching portrayal of millennial life that sought to uncover what lay beneath the veneer of the American dream. The recession of 2008 betrayed a generation of people and so, where Carrie Bradshaw masked her romantic issues with copious cocktails and $500 Manolo Blahniks, Dunham chose a more radical approach by foregoing masks all together. It embraced the warts-and-all truths of a specific generation of women. In the opening episode, we saw Dunham’s character of Hannah – a budding writer in between unpaid internships – on the point of getting cut off from her parents, despite believing herself to be the “voice of a generation”. It’s one of the many pieces of whip-smart cringe comedy, delusions of grandeur and intensity that litter the show. You aren’t supposed to like these ladies, but you are supposed to see the worst parts of you in them. After years of only men being allowed to be flawed, churlish protagonists – Tony Soprano and Walter White spring to mind – having four Girls in this realm felt revolutionary. “It was a watershed moment,” says Lagerway. “Women got to be gross, unlikable and miserable and mean to each other.” Or at least a very specific demographic of women did. One of the key objections that came to be levelled at Girls is that Dunham’s New York was essentially monoethnic – save for a few Black and brown people who played bit roles as service industry workers. Where white women felt seen, other women found the show uncomfortably blinkered. As people explored Dunham’s career, they found that she was the child of well-connected members of New York’s liberal elite – art curators Laurie Simmons and Carroll Dunham – and came to see the show’s story as one of privilege, wealth and nepotism. “I remember being very angry,” says Zeba Blay, author of Carefree Black Girls – so angry, she even started a podcast to address it. She wasn’t alone. There was a growing prominent chorus of women of colour who went on Twitter to air their grievances of being ignored and overlooked. This provoked heated reactions from those who championed the show as a revolutionary force for alternative present-day white feminism. Liz Arfin, a writer on the first season of the show, sarcastically tweeted (but has since deleted the post): “What really bothered me most about [the movie] Precious was that there was no representation of ME.” One infamous Twitter spat involved Caitlin Moran. “Did you address the complete and utter lack of people of colour in Girls in your interview? I sure hope so,” said one tweeter to Moran, who had interviewed Dunham. “Nope and I couldn’t give a shit about it!” she replied in a tweet that has also been deleted. One of the things that worked against Girls was its timing, given that it came at a precarious time for race relations. It aired two months after the murder of Trayvon Martin in February of that year – a tragedy that brought racial tensions in the US into sharper focus, leading to an increase in people exploring how whiteness presented in all aspects of life. In that context, Girls felt to some like an unabashed display of white privilege that was too much to stomach. As a result, it became one of the first intellectual playgrounds of cultural criticism of its kind. As Lagerwey points out: “2012 was the beginning of serious discussions about visibility and intersectionality.” To look back on the show is to be confronted by an important time capsule. In many ways, its central characters of Hannah, Jessa, Marnie and Jemima are young “Karens” in the making – before we had a catch-all name for that kind of white woman. They might consider themselves to be upstanding socially liberal young women, changing the fabric of society simply by their existence, but they are utterly entitled people who utilise their privilege for personal gain. The self-awareness that Dunham’s script shows in terms of other facets of these characters’ awfulness suggests there is knowingness at work here. But it nonetheless serves as a period snapshot of the unthinking clumsiness of white privilege and its pervasive nature. “Girls – like Sex and the City – is a genuinely fascinating portrait of a moment in time that will never exist again,” says Blay. With the benefit of hindsight, there is also another question worth asking: would it even have been a good idea for Dunham to write from a Black or ethnic minority perspective? Some commentators think not. “In retrospect, there’s nothing worse than a white writer who tries to write Black characters, and doesn’t have the range to truly understand them,” says Blay. “It always feels as if they’re projecting their interpretations of race on them.” Dunham writing Donald Glover into season two as her Black Republican boyfriend – and the accusations of being a ham-fisted attempt at diversity it caused – is a good example. Looking back 10 years later, it’s hard not to wonder whether the conversation that erupted around the lack of diversity in Girls has also had an important long-term consequence: putting diversity at the forefront of discussion on TV. The critique of the series’ whiteness started a public conversation that continues to this day, one that has helped to carve out space for diverse storytelling, given the increase in shows that gave voice to non-white creators that followed. While Girls shouldn’t be credited for their success, the debate it prompted may have helped the likes of Issa Rae’s Insecure and Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You make it to TV. Had the show been called White Girls, perhaps Dunham would have been able to control the narrative surrounding the show much sooner and it’s been intimated that that these characters living extremely non-diverse lives in one of the world’s most diverse cities was a deliberate way of making them seem dreadful. But, as show creator Jenny Konner stated, she was blindsided by the severity of the criticism. “I knew [the lack of diversity] would be an issue, but I didn’t think the criticism would be at the level it was,” she told The Hollywood Reporter in 2017. “Or that the conversation about race would turn into a conversation about racism,” added Dunham. To Dunham’s credit, her perspectives on race developed off screen over the years – even if it did take multiple controversies and apology cycles to get there – and she appeared to mirror her changing outlooks on screen too. As the show reached its final season, there was a tone of self-awareness that had been missing in the show’s earlier seasons. As Shoshanna says in season six, when she abruptly breaks away from her friends: “We cannot be in the same room without one of us making it completely and entirely about ourselves.” It’s just one of many moments of brilliance that Girls was littered with. Take the polarising, but defining episode One Man’s Trash episode in season 2, where Hannah embarks on a weekend long affair with a recently separated, older doctor played by Patrick Wilson. Or the season six episode America Bitch, which tackled sexual harrasment. Time rightfully called the episode “groundbreaking” adding “For better or worse, Girls is still like nothing else on television.” And, it’s worth noting one sad consequence of the debate around the series’ depiction of ethnicity: it will have robbed many potential viewers of the joy of Girls’ best moments. It hasn’t escaped Blay that lots of those who criticised the show never watched it – having been put off by the negativity surrounding it. “It’s a shame,” she says. “Because there are seasons and episodes of that show that are truly brilliant.” Ironically, in the end, Girls was overshadowed, off screen, by the exact thing it was cleverly exploring: self-centredness.",Arts/Television & radio,"Groundbreaking brilliance – or offensive display of white privilege?

4/15/2022,"The phrase ‘erotic thriller’ immediately conjures up all manner of evocative thoughts and images. Two-word titles emblazoned in a vaguely threatening red font. Michael Douglas being Michael Douglas-y. R ratings in the US, a 15 certificate (or 18 if things get really spicy) in the UK. The work of Adrian Lyne. Yuppies. A massive, preposterous third act twist. Cocaine. Boiled bunnies. Sharon Stone. Excruciating viewing experiences on the sofa with your parents. Emerging in the early 80s with American Gigolo and Body Heat before reaching its imperial phase towards the end of the decade when Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal and Basic Instinct were straddling the box office, the genre’s lurid smooshing together of sex and violence proved impossibly seductive for audiences. Of course, it couldn’t last and, as the 90s gave way to the new millennium, the erotic thriller slowly became a direct-to-video punchline, hoovering up Razzies instead of box office receipts. Now, bar the odd valiant but doomed attempt to revive it, the genre seems to be all but dead. Dead – but not entirely forgotten. In recent weeks, coinciding with the release of one of those doomed, valiant revivals – the Lyne-directed, Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas-starring Deep Water – as well as the 30th anniversary of Basic Instinct, therehas been a flurry of interest in the erotic thriller. Exhibit A – discovered alongside a silk blindfold and a pair of bloodstained handcuffs – is the latest season of Karina Longworth’s terrific Hollywood history podcast You Must Remember This. Titled Erotic 80s, it covers the broader sweep of adult films that emerged in that decade, though Longworth’s introduction makes it clear that at the centre of this eruption of steaminess is the erotic thriller. As ever, she smartly contextualises the moviemaking within the wider cultural and political headwinds of the era: sexual liberation, second-wave feminism, consumerism, the Moral Majority. A follow-up season, Erotic 90s, will follow later this year. You Must Remember This is not the only place where the erotic thriller has been re-examined of late. Over at Vulture, they recently published an exhaustive season of erotic thriller coverage, featuring everything from ‘state of the genre’ essays to interviews with genre’s great and not so good (Swimfan, anyone?). So why the sudden fascination? The answer you suspect can be found in the state of modern cinema, ruled over by family friendly franchises, squeezing out the mid-budget movie (of which the erotic thriller once was a key component) in the process. (Streaming, less beholden to self-censorship, has shown some eagerness to reboot the erotic thriller, but faces its own challenges with the genre.) As a result, Longworth notes, “sex has all but disappeared from mainstream American movies, most of which would pass the sexual standard set by the strict censorship of the Production Code of the 1930s.” In this climate, perhaps it’s understandable that some audiences are seeking something a little more … adult. Still, this isn’t to unnecessarily lionise the erotic thriller which, as well as quite often being just plain daft, had some elements that, in the age of #MeToo, look pretty unsavoury: the unswervingly male gaze; the portrayals of virtually any sexually liberated woman as a maneater; the frequent ‘gay panic’ undertones; the absence of anyone who wasn’t white (though there would at least be some correction in later years with a rise of black erotic thrillers). And that’s not to overlook some of the troubling stuff on set too: Stone, for example, has said that her ‘crossed legs’ scene from Basic Instinct, perhaps the most famous moment in any erotic thriller, was filmed without her consent. But that doesn’t mean Hollywood can’t build a better erotic thriller today, one that chimes with the times. It just needs to get over its inbuilt prudishness. As ever, TV seems to be leading the way in that regard, with a thoroughly progressive attitude to sex (one that, in contrast to the 80s and 90s, means that we’re as likely to show male nudity as female) in shows like Euphoria and Normal People. It’s even got perhaps the most obvious descendant of the genre in the form of Netflix smash hit You. Still, it’s on the big screen – in full eye-popping Technicolor – that the erotic thriller truly belongs. Come on cinema, you know you want to.

4/15/2022,"Rancorous couples who can’t stand the sight of each other are common among the parading figures of Pina Bausch’s dance theatre. But in one of her earliest creations, from 1975, she retold the story of the devoted Orpheus, expressly forbidden from looking at Eurydice as he leads her out of the underworld. Not performed in Wuppertal for almost 30 years – and more recently seen in Paris Opera Ballet’s repertoire – it has returned to Bausch’s home town in a production of piercing sadness that will also visit the Gluck festival in Fürth. In her second dance opera set to Gluck’s music (after Iphigenie auf Tauris, 1974), she distilled a balletic language to match the noble simplicity of the composer’s reform operas: lucidly emotional, never needlessly embellished movement where fouettés are as absent as coloratura. Using a German libretto, Bausch stripped the opera of its jolly overture and rejected the joyous ending. Orpheus was a musician who could make trees dance but Rolf Borzik’s set design for the first of the four acts is dominated by the long brittle branches of an uprooted tree. On the opposite side of the stage is Eurydice, in her wedding dress, frozen in time and watching her own funeral procession. The corps, with dancers dressed in black suits or chiffon, are first seen in a tangle of serpentine poses, slowly uniting through anguished port de bras, lapping like waves and introducing a motif of shielding their gaze. Bausch represented each of the three principals – the third is the Amor character – through both a dancer and a singer. This run has cross-cast the part of Orpheus, sung (as is traditional) by a mezzo-soprano on some nights and, when I went, sung by a countertenor, Valer Sabadus, and danced by Naomi Brito who is transgender. The pair are superbly attuned, whether performing side by side or separated when Sabadus embraces the bride before Brito begins an impassioned solo or, most powerfully, when Brito slams to the floor as Sabadus twice cries Eurydice’s name. When Sabadus places his hands on one of the set’s mirrors, there are shades of Jean Marais’s superstar-poet in Orphée. That film’s appropriation of Apollinaire’s line “the bird sings with its fingers” resounds, too, through dancers’ delicate hand gestures. Brito is magnetic as an Orpheus driven by pain more than pluck, the anguish heightened by Sabadus who makes even recitative seem ethereal. The melancholia is only fleetingly leavened, most effectively by dancer Emily Castelli’s insouciant Amor, characterising youth (sung by Anna Christin Sayn). A trio of apron-clad dancers representing Cerberus, the triple-headed Hades hound, raise a smile in the second act but they are soon menacing the stage with jagged jumps, as relentlessly cruel as any of Bausch’s tormentors. The Furies are anxiously fastidious figures, restricting the freedom of the stage by tying up the space with string. The contrast between their dance and that of the Blessed Spirits, both evocatively played by Wuppertal’s symphony orchestra, is diminished by a lengthy scene change between the second and third acts but Bausch’s brilliantly lit Elysian Fields is a peach dream, elegant backbends complementing the soothing flutes. If they lack a drilled precision, the corps brings a wonderful sense of balm though Bausch sours the scene with a ring of voyeurs. Soprano Naroa Intxausti excels as Eurydice, paired with dancer Luiza Braz Batista whose most affecting solo comes when the singing stops. In Josephine Ann Endicott’s restaging, under the musical direction of Michael Hofstetter and with the haunting chorus of the Wuppertaler Bühnen in the balcony, to live and love is to dance. As both Eurydices are laid to rest, Brito’s supple movement ceases and all of Orpheus’s pain is contained in a motionless body.

4/15/2022,"He was only on screen for a matter of minutes but the character he brought to life – the Star Wars bounty hunter Boba Fett – achieved cult status. From May the 4th – a nod to the franchise’s saying “May the force be with you” – fans will be able to bid for memorabilia collected by Jeremy Bulloch, the late British actor who played the character in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Among the more than 1,000 items on offer is a lifesize Boba Fett statue, estimated at between £8,000 and £12,000, that Bulloch modelled for in the 1990s and stored in his attic for almost 30 years. There is also footage that appears to show test-filming of Ewoks, the furry creatures that help the rebels in Return of the Jedi, which is expected to fetch up to £5,000, and a replica Boba Fett helmet (estimate £600-£800) that Bulloch sometimes wore for interviews. The auction follows Bulloch’s death in 2020 at the age of 75 from complications relating to Parkinson’s disease. Part of the proceeds from the auction will go to the charity Parkinson’s UK. His widow, Maureen Bulloch, said that as well as collecting souvenirs from when the films were made in the early 1980s, her husband amassed memorabilia from fans when attending Star Wars conventions. “Jeremy loved and appreciated every single item,” she said. The sale is being held by East Bristol Auctions, who on the same date last year auctioned off hundreds of items collected by the Bristolian Dave Prowse, who played Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. A Darth Vader helmet sold then for £2,200, more than five times the top estimate, and a signed picture of Alec Guinness in his Obi-Wan Kenobi robes was snapped up for £3,100, treble what was anticipated. One of the curiosities being auctioned this time is a picture from Carrie Fisher to Bulloch reading: “Jeremy – thanks for the nite of hot monkey love.” The story behind the joke has been lost in the mists of time, but the item is estimated at between £500 and £800. The auctioneer Andrew Stowe said: “Jeremy was quite clearly an avid collector – he didn’t just star in the films, he enjoyed them as much as any other fan. “Not only that but he was regarded as one of the most approachable and friendly actors, so fans adored him – and he amassed many gifts wherever he appeared. His collection is remarkable, and completely unique.”",Arts/Film,Bounty of Boba Fett actor’s Star Wars collection to go on auction,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/15/boba-fett-actor-jeremy-bulloch-star-wars-collection-auction
