3/15/2022,"STORY: The Ukrainian military on Monday released video of what it said were its soldiers battling Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv as the Russian invasion creeped closer to the country's capital. Monday morning, residents were stunned when a Russian bombardment shattered an apartment block and demolished buses, killing at least two. WITNESS, YUVGENY GUZENKO, SAYING: “One person was gone. It was an old man, around seventy. Then emergency services arrived, they tried to save another injured female, but she was also dead.” Ukraine reported more air strikes on an airport in the west, in addition to heavy shelling on the outskirts of Kyiv and attacks in the southern town of Mykolayiv, where Ukraine’s forces have mounted a counterattack. In this Kyiv auto-repair shop, the mechanics are repairing and refitting weapons captured from Russian vehicles, so that they can be turned against the invaders. AUTO REPAIR SHOP WORKER, OLEKSANDR FEDCHENKO: “We collected a team of welders, engineers. We gave them drafts, we familiarized ourselves with the drafts. We made a prototype model and it worked."" The embattled nation's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted to social media that one of Russia's war aims was to destroy Ukraine's economy. “Economic suppression against Ukraine is one of the war’s goals against us today. We have to resist this as well. Save our economy, save our people. That is why the government has been asked to work out details on how to restore small and medium business…” But in the midst of the conflict, both sides on Monday participated in what the Ukrainian representative called ""hard"" negotiations. The Russian invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation,” is the largest ground war in Europe since 1945 and has created some 2.8 million refugees. Russia continues to deny targeting civilians, saying its mission is to demilitarize and “deNazify” Ukraine, which Ukraine and Western allies call a baseless pretext for war. Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of war crimes Monday, comparing the Kremlin to the Nazis they have said they seek to eradicate. “Russian troops continue to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine, erasing any difference with their Nazi predecessors 80 years ago: cities and villages destroyed to the ground, mass graves, terror against civilians in the occupied territories, abduction and killing of representatives of local authorities, activists, and journalists.” Talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials will continue on Tuesday.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Refugees reach 2.8 mln as Russia strikes hit west Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/refugees-reach-2-8-mln-235049716.html
3/15/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Fugitive financier Jho Low, the alleged mastermind of the 1MDB scandal, stole $1.42 billion from three bond transactions that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. arranged for the Malaysian wealth fund, an FBI agent who traced the funds testified.

In addition to his testimony about Low, he told the jury that former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak reaped $756 million of the $6.5 billion raised in the bond offerings, while his stepson, Riza Aziz, pocketed $238 million. Ng, the only Goldman banker to go on trial over the epic looting of sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd, was charged with conspiring with Low and his former boss Tim Leissner in the massive fraud. Leissner, who pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government, spent more than a week on the stand as the star prosecution witness against Ng. Low is not in custody and remains a fugitive. Prosecutors have long alleged that Low paid bribes to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to facilitate the deals, but Van Dorn’s testimony was the first time the U.S. has detailed how those involved in the 1MDB deals were paid and how much they received.

He said Khadem al-Qubaisi, a former managing director of Abu Dhabi’s state-owned International Petroleum Investment Co., which guaranteed the 1MDB transactions, received $472.8 million. He also described another Abu Dhabi official who worked with the IPIC’s subsidiary and received $76.6 million. He said Aziz invested at least $60 million of his 1MDB money to produce “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Aziz was a friend of Low’s, the prosecutors said. Matthew Schwartz, a lawyer for Aziz, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on the testimony. Aziz twice before settled Justice Department lawsuits over his role in the 1MDB scandal. In 2017, his Red Granite Inc. production company agreed to pay $60 million to settle U.S. claims that “Wolf” was financed with stolen 1MDB money. In 2020, he resolved a separate government suit by agreeing to drop claims to tens of millions of dollar in U.S. and U.K. real estate without admitting wrongdoing. Ng got $35.1 million from two of the three bond transactions, while Leissner received $73.4 million during the scheme, Van Dorn testified. At the time of his 2018 plea, Leissner agreed to forfeit just $43.7 million which the U.S. said was the money he earned in the scheme. It’s unclear why Leissner is forfeiting a lesser amount. Ng’s defense team, which has been trying to suggest that Leissner is getting a favorable deal, tried to ask Van Dorn about the former banker’s forfeiture, but the judge barred questions about the it. Read more: Leissner’s Many Confessions Threaten Case Against Goldman Banker One of Ng’s lawyers, Jacob Kaplan, questioned Van Dorn about how Leissner collected an additional $39.7 million which went from Low’s accounts into an entity under the control of Leissner’s ex-wife Judy Chan Leissner, suggesting that the government had also given Leissner a break on these funds. Van Dorn said it was because his chart was based on certain transactions which occurred during the time frame of the three 1MDB bond transactions and that he’d only included money directly traceable back to Goldman Sachs’s funding of the three deals. Najib was convicted in Malaysia and sentenced to 12 years in prison and is appealing. A spokesman for Najib didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment on Van Dorn’s testimony. Meanwhile, Al-Qubaisi was sentenced in Abu Dhabi in 2019 to serve 15 years in prison and ordered along with the other IPIC executive, to repay $336 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. The case is U.S. v. Low Taek Jho, 18-cr-538, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).
