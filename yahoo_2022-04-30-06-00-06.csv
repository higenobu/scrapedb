4/30/2022,"The U.S. government faced a potential nuclear crisis in the fall of 2020, when Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, fearing that then President Donald Trump would order the U.S. military to strike China, plotted to thwart any such a directive with a scheme that one prominent Republican lawyer likened to “‘The Caine Mutiny’ with plutonium.” At a special taping of Yahoo News’ “Skullduggery” podcast on the legal perils Trump is now facing, the New York litigator, George Conway, who was once offered a top job in Trump’s Justice Department, invoked the classic 1954 film about a mutiny aboard a U.S. Navy vessel. The podcast was taped Thursday at the Politics & Prose bookstore in Washington, D.C., with Conway and the Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carol Leonnig on the panel. All three, to varying degrees, expressed skepticism as to whether Trump will ultimately be indicted for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election — despite the substantial evidence that he and his allies mounted a pressure campaign in Congress and with state officials to achieve that aim. “I think many of — maybe all — these cases, lead nowhere,” Woodward said. “And if the Justice Department, the federal government, indicts Trump, they solidify Trump as the 2024 Republican candidate for president.” Woodward argued that there are graver and more pressing issues that Congress and media should be grappling with, most urgently the prospect that a “crazy” president could on his own trigger a nuclear war. “It's less important that Donald Trump be prosecuted than that … we should perform the operation of the 25th Amendment,” he said, referring to the constitutional provision that authorizes the Cabinet, with the consent of the vice president, to declare a sitting president unfit for office. The country faced such a potential crisis in 2020, when Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, according to reporting by Woodward and his co-author, Robert Costa, in their book “Peril,” feared that an unstable Trump was about to order a nuclear hit on China. “My God, the Chinese thought we were going to attack them before the 2020 election,” Woodward said. “General Milley and people in the Pentagon were — and not just disturbed, were apoplectic about it, and apoplectic about Trump and his mental state.” At that point, Milley directed military commanders to refuse to carry out such an order from Trump unless they had also heard directly from the general. Milley met with the rest of the Joint Chiefs and secured firm commitments that they would serially resign, in order to stop Trump initiating a nuclear war. “I mean, we’re depending on people in uniform to basically say, ‘If I push this button, it’s gonna be a war crime,’ and to basically disobey orders from the president of the United States,” Conway said. “It’s 'The Caine Mutiny’ with plutonium,” he added. “It’s a huge problem not solved and is ticking away out there,” Woodward said. Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump’s top White House aides, has been a frequent target of the former president because of his stinging criticisms of his wife’s longtime boss on Twitter, cable news shows and podcasts. (Conway was offered the job of overseeing the civil division of the Justice Department under Trump, but turned it down after concluding — as he commented during a “Skullduggery"" appearance in 2018 — that the Trump administration had become a “s*** show in a dumpster fire.”) On Thursday, at about the time of the “Skullduggery” taping, Conway mocked a rally that the former president was holding in Nebraska on behalf of Charles Herbster, a candidate for governor, who has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment. “It’s a Make America Grope Again Rally,” Conway tweeted. That prompted an attack against Conway from Trump. “He’s mentally ill, a very sick man. I don’t know what Kellyanne did to him, but it must have been really bad. She has totally destroyed this guy—his mind is completely shot!” Trump said in a statement released by Save America, his political organization.",Politics/Yahoo News,"Woodward pushes 25th Amendment, says a 'crazy' president could trigger nuclear war",https://news.yahoo.com/woodward-pushes-25th-amendment-says-a-crazy-president-could-trigger-nuclear-war-181154513.html
4/30/2022,"Two blasts have been reported in a Russian border city, the latest in a series of attacks on key sites within Russia's borders, two eyewitnesses have reported. The blasts were heard in the southern part of the Belgorod. It was not immediately clear what caused them and whether there were any casualties or damage. Russia has in recent days reported what it says are a series of attacks by Ukrainian forces in Belgorod and other southern regions which border Ukraine, and has warned that such attacks raise a risk of significant escalation. On Wednesday the Russian government said an ammunition depot in the south of the country had been attacked by Ukraine. Read more: Ukraine war: Russia warns UK it could launch military strikes on British soil The governor of the region of Wednesday's attack said no civilians had been injured. Ukraine has not directly accepted responsibility but has described the incidents as payback and ""karma"" for Russia, nine weeks after it invaded its neighbour. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said it was natural that Russian regions where fuel and weapons are stored were learning about ""demilitarisation"" but did not claim responsibility for the attack. The use of that word was a pointed reference to Moscow's stated objective for the nine-week-old war in Ukraine, which it calls a special military operation to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. ""If you (Russians) decide to massively attack another country, massively kill everyone there, massively crush peaceful people with tanks, and use warehouses in your regions to enable the killings, then sooner or later the debts will have to be repaid,"" Podolyak said. He added it was not possible to ""sit out"" the Russian invasion. ""And therefore, the disarmament of the Belgorod and Voronezh killers' warehouses is an absolutely natural process. Karma is a cruel thing,"" he said. Earlier this month, Russia accused Ukraine of attacking a fuel depot in Belgorod with helicopters, which a top Kyiv security official denied, and opening fire on several villages in the province.

There have also been reports of attempted attacks on the Ukraine border region of Kursk and in the city of Voronezh. The fact Ukraine now appears to be capable of striking Russia will cause further headaches for Moscow, which convinced its population the war would be won quickly. The UK has backed up Ukraine's right to attack Russian soil with junior defence minister James Heappey saying on Tuesday it was ""completely legitimate"" for Kyiv to launch the strikes. He added that the weapons the West - including the UK - is giving to Ukraine ""have the range to be used over the border"" into Russia. The continued supply of western made weapons to Ukraine has infuriated the Kremlin. On Monday, Russian defence minister Sergei Lavrov said there was a ""real danger"" of the conflict slipping into a third world war, and said Russia viewed Nato as being “in essence” engaged in a proxy war as sovereign nations are supplying Ukraine with weapons.",World/Yahoo News UK,Two 'powerful blasts' rock Russian city near Ukraine border,https://news.yahoo.com/blasts-rock-russian-city-near-ukraine-border-181645544.html
