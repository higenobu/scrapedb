4/16/2022,"It’s strange that the silly but mostly tolerable horror Choose or Die was an acquisition rather than a homegrown Netflix original given how much it seems algorithmically modeled for the notoriously formula-obsessed platform. It stars Asa Butterfield, an in-house star thanks to the success of Sex Education. It’s contemporary-set but baked in 80s nostalgia, something that also inspires the aesthetic of the aforementioned comedy series as well as the entirety of long-running hit Stranger Things. It also focuses on a cursed video game, making it a close cousin to the streamer’s interactive Black Mirror hit Bandersnatch. It’s a film destined to live its days in the “if you like” container. It’ll probably fare well there as fans of the above might find just about enough here to play with although they might, like me, be a little surprised at just how nasty this quickie horror is, made with closer attention to the gore quotient than any level of creativity. It’s part of the cursed tech subgenre that expanded after the success of Gore Verbinski’s surprisingly effective remake of Ringu, later retitled The Ring. It led to more similarly plotted J-horror remakes, such as One Missed Call, Pulse and Shutter, and then also a string of US copycats, like Feardotcom, Unfriended and Stay Alive, a 2006 flop that saw a group of teens playing a deadly video game. We’re in similar, yet mildly more proficient, territory here with the discovery of a dusty 80s game called CURS>R (the film’s original title), that coerces players into making genuine life-or-death decisions. It’s found by 80s-obsessive Isaac (Butterfield), compelled by the idea that the $125,000 prize money might still lay unclaimed and further seduced by the recorded voice of Freddy Krueger himself, Robert Englund, at the end of the hotline. His friend, and object of affection, Kayla (relative newcomer Iola Evans) is less convinced but living on the breadline has her willing to take a chance, struggling to get by on a measly cleaner’s wage. And so it begins. What’s vaguely refreshing about this admittedly rather ho-hum set-up is that Kayla isn’t the hands-on-hips scold she might have been in another more cliche version of this story but the one who boots up the game herself to play. She’s as tech-savvy as Isaac and the film’s main, plot-propelling protagonist. The first encounter with the game sees Kayla playing in an empty diner, forced to watch a flirty waitress eat glass in front of her. It’s a bracingly nasty scene, automatically cluing us into the torture porn-adjacent territory we’re in, far from what we might have expected (there’s a whiff of the far superior Escape Room films here which exist firmly in the world of PG-13). But while the gore is impressively visceral and well-realised, the rest of it is a few steps behind. It’s an overwhelmingly British film, shot in London with local actors (there’s a bookending appearance from Eddie Marsan while soap stalwart Angela Griffin also pops up), that’s bizarrely set in an unnamed US city, forcing everyone into, at times laughably shoddy, Ay-meh-reek-uhn accents. It’s a baffling misstep, clearly made for commercial reasons, that adds a layer of amateurishness to what’s otherwise a solidly directed first feature for Brit Toby Meakins. He doesn’t quite take enough advantage of his reality-shifting game sequences (the Englund voice cameo serves to remind us just how wild Wes Craven made those nightmares way back when) but it’s a cut above the average Netflix genre guff. The script, from TV writer Simon Allen, acts as mostly just pedestrian framework for the game scenes, which thankfully do arrive quite often. The specifics of the plot make little to no real sense, even in the moment, but that won’t much matter to the sleepover crowd, who’ll be too distracted by the nasty noise of it all. Don’t understand how a malevolent curse ties to game code? Who cares, here’s a teenager eating his arm! In a choice between coherence and cruelty, it’s an easy win.

4/16/2022,"As rabbis and members of the British Jewish community, we are utterly appalled by the government’s inhumane plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for offshore processing. Such a policy flies in the face of Jewish values, and would be a cruel, moral failure to those in urgent need of protections. It is particularly disturbing that such plans have been announced shortly before our community celebrates Passover, a festival where Jews recall our journey to safety from Egypt. As we prepare to read the story of Exodus, it is deeply unsettling that the government is seeking to deprive the opportunity of freedom to those fleeing modern-day tyrants. Such proposals also bring to mind unpleasant memories of the overseas internment of Jewish refugees in the second world war. This policy was a grave error: we urge the government to learn from this historic mistake, uphold international refugee law and ensure all those seeking safety in the UK are treated with dignity and respect. If the government is serious about preventing small boat crossings, it should act to introduce safe and accessible routes to sanctuary in the UK. Seeking to replicate Australia’s disastrous offshoring system in Rwanda, a country frequently condemned for its appalling human rights record, would be a terrible abdication of responsibility. We urge the government to instead stand up, fulfil its moral duty, and protect, not punish, those fleeing conflict and persecution.Dr Edie Friedman Executive director, the Jewish Council for Racial Equality, Rabbi David Mason Muswell Hill synagogue, Rabbi Dr Jackie Tabick Reform Judaism, Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg Senior rabbi, Masorti Judaism, Rabbi Alexandra Wright Senior rabbi, Liberal Jewish synagogue",News/World news,Plans to offshore asylum seekers to Rwanda are cruel and disturbing | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/plans-to-offshore-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda-are-cruel-and-disturbing
4/16/2022,"Hugh Grant is leading a renewed attempt to prove phone hacking took place at the Sun, even as Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper continues to maintain no illegality took place there. The actor has followed Paul Gascoigne and Sienna Miller in bringing a so-called “Sun-only” phone-hacking claim, specifically alleging that illegality took place at the daily tabloid in the 2000s. Rebekah Brooks, the current chief executive of Murdoch’s News UK business, was editor of the Sun during the period in question. Murdoch’s News UK company has already paid out millions of pounds to settle claims from the likes of Miller and Gascoigne about the alleged activities of Sun journalists, ensuring the accusations are not heard at trial. “I suspect it is to some degree damage limitation,” said Nathan Sparkes, the chief executive of Hacked Off, which campaigns for tougher press regulation. “In the case of the Sun it is most likely because they are trying to avoid a full-blown court case in which lots of other details could emerge, which they don’t want coming up.” More such cases are expected in future, presenting a growing headache for Murdoch’s business as it attempts to move on from the phone-hacking era and instead focus on the imminent launch of its Piers Morgan-fronted news channel, talkTV. Morgan has himself faced ongoing accusations – which he strenuously denies – that he must have known about the practice while editor of the Daily Mirror in the 2000s. Hugh Grant’s case is awkward for News UK because the company has always said its illegal activity took place exclusively at the News of the World, the Sunday outlet it closed down in 2011 after 168 years. This has left the Sun in the unusual position of maintaining that it did not hack phones, while at the same time choosing to pay out enormous sums in damages and legal fees – albeit without any admission of wrongdoing – to people who claim otherwise. The ongoing cost of the legal action has hit the value of the Sun as a business and left it nursing enormous financial losses. The company recently failed in an attempt to shut down the ongoing legal process that makes it relatively easy for alleged phone-hacking victims to bring claims. With thousands more potential victims waiting in the wings, the legal action relating to phone hacking could now stretch into a third decade – potentially adding to the hundreds of millions of pounds that have already been paid out by Murdoch’s company. Among the individuals who have brought fresh phone-hacking claims against the company in recent weeks are the government minister Zac Goldsmith, his mother, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, the football manager Alan Pardew, the former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, the Spice Girl Mel B, Atomic Kitten’s Liz McClarnon, the actors Gillian Anderson and Kate Winslet, the boxer Joe Calzaghe and the Steps singer Lisa Scott-Lee. Grant, who settled a phone-hacking case against the News of the World in 2012, is unusual in being one of a relatively small group of people who can bring a separate claim specifically against the Sun. In a complicated legal arrangement, the still-publishing Sun and the defunct News of the World are owned by the same parent company, which means it can settle cases against the latter on the condition that victims cannot bring a separate claim against the former. But individuals who secured some of the first phone-hacking settlements in the early 2010s – such as Grant – were not asked to agree to such terms. This allows them to file a second case against the Sun. Reach, the current owner of the Daily Mirror, is also facing lengthy and ongoing legal claims for historical phone-hacking offences at its tabloid newspapers. Prince Harry also has a case working its way through the courts alleging wrongdoing at the Sun, the News of the World and the publisher of the Mirror. Sparkes, whose organisation is pushing for a public inquiry into the relationship between the media and the police, said: “The background of hacking is not only the practice itself but also the cover-up and the culture that enabled it to happen. It may have happened a long time ago but there’s no evidence the culture has fundamentally changed.” News UK has been approached for comment.",News/Media,Hugh Grant brings phone-hacking claim against the Sun,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/15/hugh-grant-brings-phone-hacking-claim-against-the-sun
4/16/2022,"In a city of innovation and a country considered the Silicon Valley of Europe, it was James Maddison who electrified Leicester City’s path to a first European semi-final, his equaliser sparking a comeback victory on a memorable night in Eindhoven, but he was not the only one to impress. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, the homegrown midfielder who spent last season on loan at Luton, was name-checked by the PSV manager, Roger Schmidt, as Leicester’s outstanding talent and the full-back Ricardo Pereira slotted in the winning goal two minutes from time to tee up a Europa Conference League tie against Roma. Then there was Wesley Fofana, whose performance was so typically peerless, quietly hoovering up in defence and pouring cold water on PSV attacks, it has become the norm. But it would be wrong to gloss over Fofana’s abundant class. The defender, who turned 21 at the end of last year, returned to first-team action only last month in the previous round, scoring at Rennes after seven months of rehabilitation from a broken leg and damaged ankle ligaments, some of which he spent building strength in the sandpit at Leicester’s sprawling 185-acre Seagrave training base. Fofana used his pace to get teammates out of trouble and plays with a maturity that belies his years. After Philipp Max got in down the left flank, Fofana rushed in to extinguish the danger before dragging his teammates up the pitch, and seconds before Maddison equalised he curtailed a PSV attack. On the hour, he cleanly raked the ball clear of Cody Gakpo and earlier ate up ground to block Eran Zahavi’s route to goal. The good news for Leicester is that Fofana, who harbours ambitions to play for France, recently signed a new five-year contract. “His anticipation as a defender is top – he just has an in-built brain for the game, his reading of the game is great,” said Brendan Rodgers. “With all due respect, he has no respect in terms of [when he is] on the field. He defends forward, he is aggressive and in my experience working with world-class players, they have got great human qualities outside of the field but when they’re on there, they’re super-aggressive and that’s exactly what he is.” After the game, the Leicester chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, who took in the game alongside his brother and vice-chairman, Apichet, and the director of football, Jon Rudkin, made his way to the dressing room to congratulate the players. Maddison reserved special praise for Fofana, who is fasting as he observes Ramadan. “I said to him at the end: ‘It takes a big heart to do that, that lung-busting run back on the counterattack, to put in the challenge, win the foul, all while he’s fasting; he deserves credit for that,” Maddison said. “He hasn’t eaten or drank all day, played a full 90 minutes … he was letting us attack, shutting down counterattacks.” Rodgers praised his players for not resorting to “playing frightened football” when they trailed and no one embodied that better than Fofana, who exhibited composure in a frenetic game alongside his sidekick Jonny Evans, another player welcomed back from injury. Maddison put in the kind of performance that will surely edge him closer to an England recall and his 14th goal of the season means Harry Kane and Tammy Abraham are the only Englishmen to have outscored him this campaign. At a time when the former key Leicester pillar Harry Maguire is enduring a rough ride at Manchester United, Fofana continues to exude calm. His performances for Saint-Étienne against Neymar and Kylian Mbappé in the French Cup convinced Leicester to make their move and the £30m they paid 18 months ago, which Rodgers predicted would prove a bargain, is beginning to look a real snip. “He is unbelievable,” the Leicester manager said. “He is a very, very talented young player. You think again, he hasn’t eaten all day … it was only midway through the game that he started to get some food on. He is a phenomenal talent and one that will go right to the very top of the game.”",Sport/Football,‘He is unbelievable’: cool Fofana fires Leicester’s hopes while fasting,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/wesley-fofana-fires-leicester-hopes-while-fasting-rodgers
4/16/2022,"After decades struggling with failing sewage infrastructure, the majority-Black city of Mount Vernon, New York, is getting a significant funding package aimed at preventing unsanitary backups in homes and stopping pollution from leaking into local rivers. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, announced on Friday that the state will dedicate $150m toward projects that include repairing and replacing the city’s collapsing sewage pipes. Some of the funding is set aside for families affected by the sewage failures. It would also help bring the city into compliance with federal court orders to stop raw sewage from pouring into the Bronx and Hutchinson rivers, which flow south into New York City’s Bronx borough, as the Guardian reported last year. “In too many communities of color like Mount Vernon, critical water infrastructure has been left to fall into disrepair, but today we are setting an example for the nation by advancing environmental justice, improving quality of life for residents, and addressing decades of disinvestment,” Hochul said in a statement. Mount Vernon, which is in Westchester county and just a 30-minute train ride from Grand Central Station in Manhattan, is one of America’s most extreme examples of what happens when infrastructure problems fester. The city sits atop a century-old network of wastewater pipes meant for a population much smaller than today’s 74,000 residents. Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard previously told the Guardian that the city has lacked the funding to revamp its infrastructure and has treated its sewage pipes like a “hot potato passed from administration to administration”. This city has far more Black residents – and far lower household incomes – than the rest of Westchester county. The Biden administration has pointed to such communities as places that would benefit from huge investments in infrastructure. Maintenance problems in Mount Vernon began to spiral out of control in recent years. By 2020, when Patterson-Howard took office, at least 1,000 families were at risk of sewage backups in their houses, and pipes were collapsing all over town – faster than the city’s sewer crew could keep up. The federal government and the state had also sued the city, ordering it to figure out how to stop sewage from polluting local waterways. Officials in town estimated that overhauling the sewers might require between $100m and $200m – a sum they said the city could not meet on its own. Mount Vernon’s public works commissioner, Damani Bush, previously said reporting by the Guardian had “set fire” to the case, helping unite stakeholders interested in solving the sanitation problems. Patterson-Howard worked with environmental authorities and lawmakers to secure the new funding for her city’s wastewater network. “Rebuilding our infrastructure is critical to the economic, social and physical health of the community,” she said in a statement. The initiative also sets aside $7m to fix one of the city’s most visible emergencies, located along the densely populated Third Street corridor. With pipes buried too deep to reach with run-of-the-mill municipal equipment, this pain-point in the city’s network no longer allows sewage to flow. The city placed a bypass pump the size of a small car in the middle of the busy street, to force human waste through the pipes. The fix was meant to be temporary. More than a year later, it’s still pumping. A pilot program will launch as part of a new initiative that will let some households get resiliency upgrades to their pipes. Several residents in Mount Vernon told the Guardian that their basements or garages flood with foul-smelling sludge during rainy weather. The city has previously received smaller funding packages to address its sanitation problems, including a $10m grant earlier this year to target river pollution.",News/US news,Majority-Black city gets $150m to fix sewage crisis from New York state,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/15/mount-vernon-sewage-funding-majority-black-city-new-york
4/16/2022,"Mira Calix, who has died unexpectedly aged 52, was a composer, electronic musician and installation artist who started out working for indie record labels and organising club nights in the experimental hinterland of the 1990s rave scene. From the moment she arrived in the UK from South Africa in 1991 (then known as Chantal Passamonte), she was making connections and changes in the music world. In 1996, she released her first record, the EP Ilanga, for Warp Records, becoming one of the first female artists to sign to the label. She came to prominence in 2003 when the London Sinfonietta premiered her work Nunu at the Royal Festival Hall, as part of the Warp Works/20th-Century Masters concert, a collaboration that was pivotal for her and the record label in expanding beyond electronica. From then on Calix was unconstrained by medium, creating work in sculpture, spoken word and conceptual art as well as musical composition and performance. Nunu – for which Calix used the sounds of insects both recorded and live on stage as part of the performance – was her first commissioned piece for orchestra. She went on to produce work in theatre and opera, including the multimedia opera Elephant and Castle (2007) in collaboration with the composer Tansy Davies (and libretto by Blake Morrison), for the Aldeburgh festival, and Dead Wedding, a remaking of the Orpheus myth with puppetry, commissioned by Opera North for the 2007 Manchester international festival. For the Sydney festival in 2015, she created the installation Inside There Falls, a vast, rustling paper maze providing an immersive experience of music, voice and dance, and in 2017 she composed scores for Royal Shakespeare Company productions of Julius Caesar and Coriolanus. With each commission or collaboration she made intellectually rigorous, politicised yet accessible works that reached large audiences. Perhaps her biggest audience came with her 2018 Armistice Day sound art piece accompanying Tom Piper’s Beyond the Deepening Shadow installation at the Tower of London, in which thousands of flames were lit in the moat. It was a complex composition centred on a choral piece, a setting of a poem by the war poet Mary Borden, illustrating the fragile and ephemeral nature of social and political alliances. However, Calix never left her roots in underground club culture, and continued to DJ around the world, while releasing records filled with echoes from her early years in London’s more far-out nightspots and also grappling with the newest club sounds. Her last album, absent origin, was released at the end of 2021. Calix was born and grew up in Durban, the daughter of Gabriele and Riccarda Passamonte. Hers was a liberal middle-class family with English and Italian heritage, and she grew up learning ballet and immersed in jazz and classical music – she credited her Zulu childminder with sparking her political engagement. She moved to London to study photography, escaping a culture that had been stifled by apartheid and international sanctions. Her favourite music at the time was the experimental indie rock of Spacemen 3 and “shoegaze” bands, and by 1993 she found work as a press officer for the indie label 4AD. She was also immersed in the electronic music scene, working behind the counter of the Ambient Soho record shop in Berwick Street, booking acts for the chillout room of the psychedelic rave night Megatripolis and putting on squat parties in Brixton. She became part of the Telepathic Fish collective, who put on 14-hour ambient sessions; her earliest DJ gigs were under the name “Chantal Telepathic Fish”. In 1994 she became the press officer at Warp Records, and began a relationship with the label that would last for the rest of her life. When her first tracks were released in 1996, there was no career plan to be a musician – she considered herself a DJ – and it would be two years until her next single, and another two after that before she made an album. But that album, One on One (2000), was an extraordinary work, and marked the arrival of a serious creative force. Sadly, in the then overwhelmingly male world of electronica she did not get the kudos of her Warp contemporaries Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Boards of Canada and Autechre, with some fans accusing her of not making her own music (she was married at the time to Autechre’s Sean Booth – they later separated). The album Skimskitta followed in 2003 and Eyes Set Against the Sun in 2007. After the Sinfonietta collaboration in 2003, Calix began to branch out. She had toured with Radiohead in 2000 and continued to DJ, but she also built installations in tunnels and churches – exploring what it meant to be a body hearing, seeing and feeling in those spaces. For Opera North, with United Visual Artists, she created Chorus (2009), an audio-visual installation of light- and sound-emitting pendulums, presented first at the Howard Assembly Room, Leeds, and then at Durham Cathedral. Nothing Is Set in Stone, for the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London, was an interactive sound sculpture at Fairlop Waters park in Ilford. It took the form of an egg-shaped cluster of “singing stones” (activated by the presence of people) whose emanating music gave instant delight and evoked ancient mystery. Calix’s fluency in explaining her ideas and the same easy geniality that had allowed her to network so fast on arriving in London made her adept at navigating the art world. Her records and artworks buzzed with the pleasure principle, and she could often be found dancing at shows. Her final album was both joyous and full of righteous anger, and showed her as creatively invigorated as she had ever been. She is survived by her partner, the visual artist Andy Holden, her mother Gabriele and her sister, Genevieve.

4/16/2022,"Ukraine has said it is bracing itself for revenge attacks from Russia after the “significant and symbolic” sinking of Russia’s flagship cruiser, the Moskva. The government in Kyiv said it had destroyed the giant missile cruiser during a combat operation against Russian vessels in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The boat’s ammunition deck exploded after it was hit by two Neptune anti-ship missiles, the government said. According to Lithuania’s foreign minister, Arvydas Anušauskas, the cruiser sent out a distress call. By 1.14am local time (2314 BST) on Thursday the Moskva was lying on its side and about half an hour later “all the electricity went out,” he posted on Facebook. From 2am a Turkish ship managed to rescue 54 sailors. An hour later Turkey and Romania confirmed the ship had “completely sunk”. Ukrainian officials said stormy weather stopped Russian boats from carrying out an evacuation, adding: “Nature was on our side.” The Kremlin has not given any details on possible casualties among the 510 crew of the Moskva, and has not released any photographs of the stricken ship. An article published by the Tass state-run news agency initially claimed the “entire crew” had been evacuated. It was later edited to remove the word “entire”. One unconfirmed Ukrainian report said 14 sailors including the chief of Moskva’s medical service were taken to the Crimean port of Sevastopol. The fate of the other 494 was unknown, it said. If they are confirmed to have drowned it would amount to the largest number of deaths of Russian servicemen in a single incident since the second world war. Pavel Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian interior ministry adviser who has a popular Telegram channel, posted a photo of the Moskva’s captain, Anton Kuprin. Kuprin was killed during the explosion and fire on the ship, Gerashchenko claimed. It was Kuprin who gave the order for the Moskva to shell Snake Island in the Black Sea during the first hours of Moscow’s invasion. Its Ukrainian defenders refused to surrender and said: “Russian warship ‘go fuck yourself’” – a slogan that has become a national meme. Ukrainians on Friday celebrated the ship’s demise. The defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, trolled his Russian counterparts by tweeting a photo of a scuba diver and a giant turtle. “A ‘flagship’ Russian warship is a worthy diving site,” he wrote, adding: “Will definitely visit the wreck after our victory in the war.” A ""flagship"" russian warship is a worthy diving site. We have one more diving spot in the Black Sea now. Will definitely visit the wreck after our victory in the war.BTW, I already have 300 scuba dives pic.twitter.com/q2Buc51qeI Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern security and defence forces, said the sinking had dealt a blow to Vladimir Putin’s “imperial ambitions”. She added: “We understand that attacks will increase. The enemy will try to retaliate. It will increase rocket strikes and artillery shelling.” Russia has said it is investigating what caused the Moskva to sink. Its defence ministry has promised to bomb targets in Kyiv in response to what it said were “terrorist and sabotage” attacks on its territory carried out by Ukraine’s “nationalist regime”. On Friday Moscow said it had struck a plant that made and repaired Ukrainian missiles, including anti-ship missiles, on the outskirts of the city. On Russian television, hosts and pundits came perilously close to admitting that the loss of the cruiser was the result of an enemy attack as opposed to the result of an accident onboard. They also talked in vehement terms about wiping out “Ukraine-ness”. “Just the fact there is an attack on our territory is casus belli, an absolute cause for war. A real war, no fooling around,” said the Russian film director and former MP Vladimir Bortko, on the popular 60 Minutes talkshow on state-run television. The special operation, as he was reminded Russia’s war is called, “ended tonight”. When asked if he was speaking about the Moskva, he said: “The Moscow cruiser is absolutely a cause for war. One hundred per cent. It’s our flagship. There’s nothing to think about. We need an answer.” On Telegram, prominent Russian officials sought to downplay the loss of a ship valued by Forbes at $750m (£575m). “The Moscow cruiser is a year older than me,” wrote Margarita Simonyan, the head of the state propaganda channel RT. Andrei Medvedev, a deputy in the Moscow city parliament and a Russian state news journalist, paraphrased the Russian imperial field marshal Mikhail Kutuzov by writing: “The loss of [the] Moscow does not mean that Russia is lost.” In a long post, he told his 70,000 subscribers on Telegram that the cruiser may indeed have been struck by a western missile with help from Nato and that the incident should be investigated. “We are not fighting Ukraine, but Nato,” he wrote. “Strikes against our forces are made with the aid of Nato systems. And often with their weapons.” Like others, he added that the ship was old. “The Moskva, with all due respect, was not a young cruiser,” he wrote. Ukraine says it has damaged or sunk eight Russian ships and boats, reducing Russia’s capacity to attack the south of Ukraine and the port city of Odesa. It said about 20,000 Russian soldiers and officers had been killed since the beginning of Putin’s military operation on 24 February. In an intelligence update on Friday, the UK’s defence ministry said the Moskva “served a key role as a command vessel and air defence node”. Moscow was now likely to review its “maritime posture” in the Black Sea, it said. The Soviet-era boat had been through an extensive refit, only returning to service last year, it added. The last time Russia lost its flagship cruiser was in 1904, when the imperial vessel Petropavlovsk went down in the tsar’s war with Japan. Ukrainian officials acknowledge the sinking of the Moskva does not mean Russia is beaten. But they see it as a signal event. Russia, meanwhile, has used long-range Tupolev bombers for the first time to attack the besieged port city of Mariupol, Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, said on Friday. Russia had not managed to fully control the port city, he added, despite a six-week siege.",News/World news,Ukraine braces for revenge attacks from Russia after Moskva sinking,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/ukraine-braces-revenge-attacks-russia-moskva-sinking
4/16/2022,"There are seven weeks to go until the first Test against New Zealand at Lord’s and English cricket is without a permanent chair, a managing director of men’s cricket, a head coach, a selector and now a captain. Things may start to move quickly on the managing director front in the coming days, but it is still a remarkable leadership vacuum.Joe Root’s decision to step down on Good Friday was much like Alastair Cook’s five years ago; a race having been run and the eventual realisation that a fresh voice was required in the dressing room. Similarly, the news was broken via official channels despite both men sharing it with teammates in advance, with the lack of a leak underlining the regard in which they were held. There was also, like Cook, a stated desire from Root to still give everything to the cause. The 31-year-old may have had shortcomings as a leader and a tactician, all the while working with a talent pool shrunk by English cricket’s lurch towards the white ball formats and during a global pandemic. But his personal form over the past 12 months has been celestial and his lack of ego is such that his replacement - most likely Ben Stokes - will get a selfless, trustworthy senior player in the ranks who is unlikely to brood or cause disruption. The timing of Root’s departure comes at the end of a week in which candidates for the director of men’s cricket job were interviewed. Rob Key is looking the likely choice now that Durham’s Marcus North has withdrawn for family reasons. Andrew Strauss is leading the process and is the type to keep a tight lid on things – he sprung a surprise in 2015 when Jason Gillespie was heavily touted to become head coach, only for Trevor Bayliss to emerge from the blue – but talks with Key are believed to be at an advanced stage.Did Root know which way the wind was blowing here? Certainly Key, in his role as a Sky pundit, was critical of his leadership after the team’s 4-0 pasting in Australia, pinning the team’s strategic errors and “negative mindset” on the captain and asking how he had survived a cull that saw Ashley Giles, Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe removed. Opinions can change upon taking a role and assessing the landscape more closely, but it would have been a tricky appraisal from which to row back. More light may be shed on this soon, but the word from teammates is that Root made the decision solely on his terms. At the end of the recent 1-0 defeat in the Caribbean, and with adrenaline still pumping, he had re-asserted his “passion” to continue in the role and spoke of “big strides forward” having been taken on the trip. Clearly it took time away from the pressure cooker – and the need to always think and talk positively – to come to a more logical conclusion.When considering the nature of the 10-wicket defeat in Grenada last month it was hard to see any other outcome, as after the Ashes, only a series win could have prevented this outcome. Instead, one of the enduring images was of Root on the balcony in St George’s, hands covering a haunted face, after Ben Foakes was witlessly run out during the defining collapse on day three. Having spent that morning utterly powerless to prevent Joshua Da Silva’s century turning the match in favour of West Indies, he looked like a captain out of ideas. Not that it was all bad. The dream of being an Ashes-winning captain may have been evaporated in Melbourne by an unlikely executioner in Scott Boland, but away wins in Sri Lanka (twice) and South Africa, as well as strong home form until last summer, mean Root should not be damned by a run of one win from his final 17 Tests in charge. That solitary victory over India at Headingley last August was also a record 27th in the job (even if this also comes down to time served and is only one more than the number of defeats). Overall, he has been an unimpeachable ambassador for the English game. But the pandemic threw up a hugely challenging schedule and there was also the sense that however much Root’s bat glowed, his teams lacked any meaningful identity. Perhaps this was hard to establish in parallel with Eoin Morgan’s limited overs juggernaut – a setup with such a defined philosophy that even when 16 players were lost to Covid outbreak last summer, little changed - or simply impossible given the dearth of Test-quality players coming through the system. Root was also a conflict-averse character and one who often chose not to own tricky decisions publicly, such that still we don’t know whether the recent call to leave out Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad – an extraction that Morgan performed unflinchingly in 2015 – was something he fully agreed with or not. Given that personalities seldom change, he needed a forthright coach alongside him but instead got two similarly amiable facilitators in Bayliss and Silverwood. Who steps up? Everything points to Stokes, even if this will place a greater burden on him as an all-format all-rounder. Jonny Bairstow is the only other batter in the team guaranteed a spot, but seldom gets mentioned as captaincy material, while talk of Broad is not without merit but falls apart when considering a summer of seven Test matches that will challenge all the seamers, not least those well into their 30s. Perhaps Moeen Ali should be talked out of Test retirement and return to captain from No7, like a modern day Ray Illingworth. Really, English cricket’s leadership reshuffle should start with the position of chair, and then work its way down from there. But if we have learned anything from a horror year that ended with a raft of sackings and now Root’s resignation, the road to recovery will be a long one regardless of who is in charge.",Sport/Sport,Joe Root’s sad but inevitable departure leaves England with huge gaps at the top | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/15/joe-roots-sad-but-inevitable-departure-leaves-england-with-huge-gaps-at-the-top
4/16/2022,"Question: can this Manchester United season become any worse? Answer: almost certainly given the nadirs Ralf Rangnick’s team keep experiencing, the latest coming in the stupefying loss at Everton. Rangnick has won eight of his 17 Premier League games in charge: the lowest percentage (47%) by any manager. At the moment, then, his hiring has failed and, thus, do not write Norwich off despite the Canaries bottom-place status.

4/16/2022,"Jewish residents in a central Israeli city have formed an armed group they say is for self-defence, after a string of Palestinian attacks across the country sparked fears of a new wave of internal violence. The mixed city of Lod, near Tel Aviv, became the focal point of communal bloodshed that flared in Israel last year, with the government and police struggling to control clashes between Arabs and Jews. “Until now, I haven’t personally seen the need to carry a weapon but there are friends who have weapons, certainly. There is weaponry, doctors and medics,” said Michael Lichtenstein, who terms himself the “security coordinator” of the group. More than 50 volunteers serve in the group, based in Ramat Elyashiv, a Jewish area of the city that is a stronghold of rightwing religious nationalists. Lod residents say they have yet to see the group on the streets. But according to its organiser, volunteers are already active in deterring alleged harassment of Jewish children by Arab youths, albeit without the use of guns. Arab residents of the city see the new group as a militia that could target them, accusing the mayor of Lod, Yair Revivo, of backing its establishment. To some on the Israeli far right, the potentially volatile development should be welcomed as boosting the police. “The obligation and right of a citizen to defend himself takes priority and I have a problem with anyone who thinks these people are criminals,” said the Knesset member Simcha Rothman, of the Religious Zionism opposition party, who has moved to Lod temporarily from his settlement in the occupied West Bank to, in his words, bolster a Jewish community threatened by Arabs. Last month, after the bloodiest attack in greater Tel Aviv in years, Israel’s hard-right prime minister called on citizens with gun licences to arm themselves. “What is expected of you, Israeli citizens? Vigilance and responsibility,” Naftali Bennett said in a video statement. “Whoever has a gun licence, this is the time to carry it.” There has been a dramatic rise in applications for gun licences in Israel, according to the local Channel 12 television news. In the wake of the attacks, Israeli troops have responded with deadly raids across the West Bank that are causing the deaths of civilians as well as militants and, critics say, adding fuel to the fire. Lod, notorious for crime and gun violence among a minority of its Arab residents, offers a microcosm of how Arab-Jewish tensions are again rising across Israel, and not only in the occupied Palestinian territories. As Rothman’s relocation shows, the conflict in the West Bank is being imported into Israel proper by the same hardcore religious Jewish nationalists who are fuelling tensions in the area Israel captured in 1967. For Lichtenstein and hardline nationalists, Israel’s future is at stake. “It worries me that [Arabs] aren’t afraid of the police, that the police don’t collect their weapons and that the army has lost its deterrence,” he said. Chen Masika, a history teacher who supports Lichtenstein’s efforts, said the two sides had entered a battle in which the very existence of Jews in Lod and throughout Israel was at stake. “They want everything, not just Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. Leaders of Lod’s Arabs, as well as leftwing Jewish Israeli observers, say the formation of militias can only help push the city to a fresh explosion of violence. “How can we live together if their goal is to deter us from Jews and to frighten us?” asked Fada Shehada, an Arab city councillor. Last year, the city’s streets resembled a war zone, with Arabs and Jews attacked, Muslim graves vandalised and synagogues torched. Lod’s Arab community are the descendants of Palestinians who stayed in the country after the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, when an estimated 700,000 others were expelled or fled. While life was once relatively calm in Lod, known as Lydda in Arabic, today both Arab and Jewish residents say the Israeli police do not do enough to protect them. Lichtenstein, who served for more than 10 years in the Israeli army, some of that as a logistics officer, said his new force would use weapons only in accordance with the law. Its backers say the group is in regular contact with the police. Mayor Revivo’s office and that of the internal security minister, Omer Bar-Lev, did not respond to queries for this article. The armed force was being primed to protect Jewish residents precisely because there could be a fresh oubreak of violence, Lichtenstein said. “I know that if events break out all at once the police won’t reach me in the first hours so my preparedness is for the first hours until the police come. The issue is what do I do to safeguard my neighbourhood and the families that live there?” The Lod security volunteer group had distinct vests and hats, Lichtenstein said. A resident coming out of a mosque who said he was a close relative of Musa Hassouna, an Arab Lod resident who was shot dead last year, said he expected further violence and, pointing towards a nearby Jewish neighbourhood, added: “Because of the settlers”. Meanwhile, Lod’s Jewish residents recall an overwhelmed police force last year failing to respond to their calls for help. They say police have since improved but fear they are still not up to the challenge. Meirav Cohen, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in a mixed building, welcomed Jewish residents organising themselves for self-defence. “There is no choice. We don’t want to be where we were a year ago,” she said. Eran Nissan, the head of the leftwing Israeli group Mehazkim, said the formation of militias in Lod reflected the fact that Israel was at a very dangerous juncture, especially in light of the current escalation. “When you arm a society, it’s very hard to disarm it,” he said.",News/World news,Israeli city’s Jewish residents form armed ‘self-defence’ group,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/israeli-city-jewish-residents-form-armed-self-defence-group
4/16/2022,"As Russian media and officials struggled on Friday to explain the sinking of the country’s Black Sea flagship, it was clear that the loss of the cruiser and an untold number of its estimated 510 crew was a blow to Vladimir Putin’s war plans and his military’s prestige. From the beginning, the Russian government tried to play down what had happened. At first its defence ministry claimed an accident had caused a fire onboard. Then the ministry said the damage had been contained and the ship was being towed to port in Sevastopol. Finally, late on Thursday, the ministry announced that the ship had sunk in “stormy seas”. But even as commentators on state TV tried to spin the loss of the Moskva as a temporary setback, Russians could understand that something serious had taken place. Andrei Medvedev, a journalist at the state-run broadcaster VGTRK and a deputy for the Moscow city council, wrote: “The Moskva cruiser is a bad story. Both from a reputational and a military point of view. But is it a catastrophe? No.” The scale of the loss is yet to be seen. Ukraine claims it struck the Moskva with a Neptune anti-ship missile. No pictures of the Moskva or its crew have been published in Russian media since the ship was damaged. Some western reports suggest just dozens of the estimated 500 crew-members were rescued as the ship went down. Russia has not published any official information about the number of sailors who died. So unlikely was the loss of the ship in Moscow’s eyes that in 2020 Orthodox Christian officials said it had been designated to carry a piece of the “true cross,” a relic from the wooden cross on which Jesus Christ is said to have been crucified. At the very least it will strike yet another blow at the image of the Russian military as a professional force carrying out what the Kremlin calls a “special operation” on the territory of Ukraine. The ship’s sinking was “in sharp contrast with the image of a successfully modernised army promoted by Russian officials and state-owned media, and with the self-confidence with which Russia embarked on this war,” wrote Alexander Baunov, a political analyst. The loss of the cruiser may not make a crucial difference in Russia’s war plans. The Russian fleet will continue to blockade Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea, although it appears that the flotilla has moved further from the coastline in order to prevent another attack. Some less plausible scenarios, such as a Russian amphibious landing near Odesa, appear even more remote now. Meanwhile, the fighting on the ground continues. Russian pundits claimed that the sinking of the ship was a distraction from Russia’s creeping gains in cities such as Mariupol, where Moscow claims Ukrainian marines have surrendered. The Russian army is pivoting toward an offensive in Ukraine’s east, promising a new chapter in the war that will rely far more on trenches and heavy artillery than the previous months. But the scale of the losses onboard the Moskva will doubtless shock the Russian public, which has been told repeatedly, like Putin, that the war in Ukraine is going to plan. The sinking is just the latest indication that the conflict will not end soon.",News/World news,Loss of Moskva strikes serious blow to Russian military’s prestige,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/loss-of-moskva-strikes-serious-blow-to-russian-militarys-prestige
