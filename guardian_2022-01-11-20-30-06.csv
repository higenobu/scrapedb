1/11/2022,"Around the holidays last year, when I’d been fielding lots of deep questions at bedtime about sickness and health and Zoom school and “pods,” I wrote my daughter an email, though she could not yet read: Scratching your back just now before bed, you sleepily asked, Mama, do you know anyone in the family who’s bold? I was like yes! You’re bold. And you said I am? And I said yes, you’re brave. And you said no no, like has no HAIR, mama.  The first email I sent her, she was two. I’d texted a friend one day that, apropos of nothing, my daughter had started referring to people she loved – her aunt, her grandma, her friend at the playground – as “my little darling.” My friend wrote back, “You gotta find a way to remember that. Email her!” And I thought: Yes, in an age when the prospect of buying a physical scrapbook and getting out the glue stick and photo corners is about as realistic as my making it through the day without crushed Goldfish in my hair, I can send an email. So I opened up a new account and dashed off a note to my pint-sized Holly Golightly. And I keep dashing off notes, because the lift is pretty low; it’s one way to manage the morass of digital ephemera I collect on my children every day; and, like nearly every parent before me, I feel an inexplicable urge to preserve in amber the moments of childhood that are too charming to be forgotten. And it’s an urge that’s been documented for centuries. “The design of this little book is to supply a want, though perhaps an unknown one to many,” begins the preface of Baby’s Record: A Twofold Gift for Mothers and Children, published in 1889. “Most persons regret that the little items of babyhood, so interesting, to the parents at least, pass into oblivion.” What do I not want to pass into oblivion? Here’s a note from me, on the occasion of the morning of my 36th birthday: You tromped in, looked at me v closely, and said, Mama, I know it’s your birthday but you still look like you’re the same height. You still look just like you’re 35. Here’s another from my husband, sent – I realized when looking at the date – just a few hours before I started contractions with her little sister: Your mama told me that after you brushed your teeth this evening, she walked into your bathroom to find you brushing your nose, quite seriously, with an electric toothbrush. She said you shouldn’t brush your nose and you replied “Why not?” And she didn’t have a good answer. “Baby books are full of minutiae, capturing all sorts of stuff that doesn’t get recorded otherwise,” Russell Johnson told me when I reached him on Zoom. “There are gems throughout.” Johnson is a curator at the UCLA Library Special Collections. Through donations, and searching on eBay, he’s built up the university’s baby book collection to its current 1,900 volumes. The collection spans from 1872 – around when infant mortality started improving, but also when people started caring more about babyhood as a life stage – to the mid-twentieth century. So we’re in the 150th year, give or take, of chronicling baby lives in some way. The alleged purpose of these keepsakes has evolved over the years, Johnson explained. Well-to-do families of yore often used their pages to list gifts given to their babies. As scientific medicine grew and pediatrics was formalized as a specialty, mothers were encouraged to document metrics: height, weight, all the things we measure today at doctors’ visits. More recent books, whether those are physical or virtual, allow room for photos of sonograms, or hashtags. But all babybooks remain at heart an in-between document – part biography, part scrapbook; part data, part personal – that often says more about the chronicler than it does the chronicled. Take this mother in 1906, who wrote in one baby book from the archives: Five weeks have passed since I was born, Quite uneventful thus far each morn, But Today I go to Auntie I’s, A trip quite long for a girl my size. If my friend told me she’d been filling out a baby book in rhyming couplets five weeks post-partum, and from the POV of her baby, I’d scurry over with a magnum of wine and the phone number of my therapist. And no one – baby, mother, or century-removed observer – will ever care much about the fact that this baby visited her aunt at five weeks’ old. But the effort it must have taken! The love this mother must have felt, as she memorialized the monotony and wonder of the early days of parenthood – that’s what this entry is about. Only one friend of ours isn’t documenting her kids’ childhoods with emails or digital journal entries or iPhone notes. Her husband is fearful of big tech companies, rightly pointing out that he doesn’t want Google having a record of who his daughter is before she is of an age to understand and consent. I hear that. But I’m not sure raging against the machine in this particular way will protect my children from the ills of big tech, save for keeping secret that my daughter will be advertising target #1 for a new-to-market nose brush. As for how my millennial friends and I are evolving the practice of baby chronicling, my hope is that what the medium lacks in physicality, it makes up for in honesty. Photos are taken and preserved because they project some desirable image of the family. Metrics become irrelevant the moment they’re jotted down. Instead, these letters are time capsules, little intimate tidbits and clues of who my child will become, sent off to that future self, from who I once was. Johnson is often asked why people would ever give their beloved baby books away, such that they find their way to him. “Kids might not be that interested,” he said – underscoring that we parents write for us, even if we think we’re writing for them; that we leave behind a chronicle of our own lives, even as we think we’re leaving behind one of theirs. “I would hope that when you give these emails to your children, one thing they will be fascinated at is how interested you were in them.” My infant son has started to do something at bedtime. Right before I put him down, he’ll gaze up at me and start cooing, like a little dove, his eyes big and round in the dark. He’ll do it for a solid minute or so before exhaustion overpowers him, at which point he’ll stick his second finger in his mouth, turn his head to the side, and fall asleep. Years into the future, will he care that he once did this? Probably not. But I wrote a quick email to him about it this morning. Because yes, I’m interested, interested in every moment.

1/11/2022,"Iwas fortunate to play a small part in a new study, just published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, which shows that the Earth broke yet another heat record last year. Twenty-three scientists from around the world teamed up to analyze thousands of temperature measurements taken throughout the world’s oceans. The measurements, taken at least 2,000 meters (about 6,500ft) deep and spread across the globe, paint a clear picture: the Earth is warming, humans are the culprit, and the warming will continue indefinitely until we collectively take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  We used measurements from the oceans because they are absorbing the vast majority of the heat associated with global warming. In fact, more than 90% of global warming heat ends up in the oceans. I like to say that “global warming is really ocean warming”. If you want to know how fast climate change is happening, the answer is in the oceans. But this paper was not merely an academic exercise. It has tremendous consequences to society and biodiversity on the planet. As oceans warm, they threaten sea life and the many food chains that originate in the sea. Warmer ocean waters make storms more severe. Cyclones and hurricanes become more powerful; rains fall harder, which increases flooding; storms surges are more dangerous; and sea levels rise (one of the major causes of rising sea levels is the expansion of water as it heats). How much did the world’s oceans warm in 2021 compared with the previous year? Well, our data shows that oceans heated by about 14 zettajoules (a zettajoule is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules of energy). This is a mind-bending number, so it may help to use analogies. This is the equivalent of 440bn toasters running 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Another way to think about this is that the oceans have absorbed heat equivalent to seven Hiroshima atomic bombs detonating each second, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I have plotted the ocean heat, measured since the late 1950s, and the clear, persistent rise over the past three to four decades is unmistakable evidence of an Earth that is out of balance. The oceans are vast, and you need many measurements spread out across the planet to get a good sense of what is happening to the oceans as a whole. This study used hi-tech temperature sensors on autonomous buoys that rise and fall in the ocean waters as they make measurements. These sensors then send the data to laboratories around the world for analysis. In addition, we deployed high-quality temperature sensors from ships, temperatures from stationary buoys, and even strapped sensors to animals so we could measure temperatures from the water they traveled through. Our research was enabled by thousands of in-field researchers who are obtaining and processing the raw data. Without their contribution, studies like this would not be possible. We discovered that the temperatures are not rising uniformly across the planet. We found the fastest warming in the Atlantic, Indian and northern Pacific Oceans. In our work we also explore the question of why this pattern is emerging the way it is. Using climate model simulations, we directly tie various features of the ocean to human emissions of industrial pollution and greenhouse gases. These findings suggest that a similar pattern is likely to persist into the coming decades. The information we used is absolutely crucial for understanding the planet. You could say that we took the Earth’s temperature – and the Earth’s fever is getting worse. I asked my colleague Alexey Mishonov, a research scientist at the University of Maryland, about the implications of these findings. “Our results demonstrated that ocean warming is extensively penetrating deeper layers of the ocean,” Dr Mishonov said. “The resulting increase of the ocean heat content cannot be adequately assessed without real measurements. We need to continue our field missions and collect these data.” My new year’s resolution is to help the planet cool down. It’s getting hot in here and there is no sign things are going to change anytime soon. Collectively, we certainly have the technology to reduce greenhouse gases, but we have never really shown the will.

1/11/2022,"A pair of “distinguished” dog-breeders were ordered to pay £400,000 by a judge for forcing animals to keep getting pregnant over at least six years. The married couple, Karl and Victoria Shellard, set up the unlicensed business called “PosherBulls” at their country home selling pups for up to £20,000 a time, Cardiff crown court heard.  The couple forced breeding bitches to deliver more than one litter a year – breaking animals welfare laws, the court heard. They bred at least 67 litters over six years – with one dog named Coco delivering six litters within a four-year period. Karl, 43, and Victoria Shellard, 40, were both fined £19,000 and were ordered to pay back £372,531 – or face two years in prison. They were also ordered to pay court costs of £43,775. The pair made up to £372,000 selling bulldog puppies to customers through ads on a website and social media – and have more than £1m in assets. The court heard the pair were repeatedly told to apply for a licence from Vale of Glamorgan council but ignored the authorities. The prosecutor, Tim Evans, said the Shellards claimed to be “experienced breeders” and “leaders in distinguished bulldogs of all colours”. Karl Shellard claimed he had not sent off the licence application because they were trying to sell their home and would need to change the address. He admitted practising dog breeding for six years despite not having a licence. Victoria Shellard said they would sell puppies for anything between £1,500 and £20,000. The pair admitted back to back breeding – where dogs had delivered more than one litter in a 12-month period. The court heard the crimes took place between 2014 and 2020 – with information on C-sections showing 43 litters had been delivered in just one year. An investigation revealed the Shellards attempted to avoid authorities by using “co-ownership contracts” where they paid others to officially own or house the dogs. The pair pleaded guilty to breeding dogs without a licence and nine counts of failing to ensure the needs of a protected animal for which they were responsible. Investigations under the Proceeds of Crime Act revealed they made £372,531 illegally but had available assets of £1,041,714. Heath Edwards, defending, said the business became “nationally and internationally recognised” for the quality of the dogs which were “healthy and of unquestionable pedigree”. Judge David Wynn Morgan said: “You were running a puppy farm and doing it to make money, and you made a great deal of money indeed. “You could have run an extremely profitable business if you were properly registered but you’re going to pay the price for that folly.” The couple have three months to pay or receive 24 months in prison.",News/World news,"Dog breeders ordered to pay £400,000 for animal welfare offences",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/dog-breeders-ordered-to-pay-400000-for-animal-welfare-offences
1/11/2022,"Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has said troops from a Russian-led military bloc will begin their withdrawal from the country within two days. Tokayev asked for assistance from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) last week to help him regain control, after unrest that left at least 164 people dead.  The deployment, swiftly agreed to by the alliance, led to speculation that it could be used to create a permanent Russian foothold in Kazakhstan. However, Tokayev insisted the withdrawal would begin this week and would be completed within 10 days. “The main mission of the CSTO peacekeeping forces has been successfully completed,” he said, in an address to Kazakhstan’s parliament. Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the troops would withdraw according to the requested timetable. “It is fully and completely the prerogative of the country which forwarded this request to the CSTO … It is their analysis, and we have no right to intervene in it,” he told reporters. Tokayev ordered a ruthless crackdown last week after protests over rising fuel prices were taken over by violent groups, who attacked government buildings and briefly seized the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city. He has described those involved as “terrorists” with shadowy foreign backers. The interior ministry said on Tuesday that 9,900 people had been detained in the aftermath of the violence. With the authorities back in control of the country, Tokayev made a range of announcements in an address to Kazakhstan’s parliament on Tuesday aimed at mollifying public discontent with the ruling elites. Tokayev noted that “a layer of wealthy people even by international standards” had appeared in Kazakhstan during the reign of his predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled the country from 1991 to 2019 and handpicked Tokayev as his successor. Nazarbayev, 81, has remained absent from public view since the protests began, and Tokayev removed him from his position as head of the national security council last week. The extreme wealth accumulated by many of his family members and allies has contributed to the mood of protest in the country. Tokayev said these wealthy people, as well as profitable companies, would have to contribute to a new national fund, named For the People of Kazakhstan, which he planned to set up. “I believe that the time has come for them to give what is due to the people of Kazakhstan and to help the people on a systematic and regular basis,” he told parliament. Tokayev ordered the government to draw up a list of companies who would be required to contribute. Also on Tuesday, Tokayev nominated Alikhan Smailov as prime minister. Smailov was previously first deputy prime minister in the cabinet, which Tokayev dismissed last week. As well as personnel changes, authorities last week arrested the security services chief, Karim Masimov, a longstanding regime insider and former prime minister. His arrest, on suspicion of treason, has increased speculation that regime infighting was at least partly behind the violence of last week.",News/World news,"Kazakhstan: Russian-led military bloc to start withdrawing troops, says president",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/kazakhstan-russian-led-military-bloc-to-start-withdrawing-troops-says-president
1/11/2022,"In a phone interview with Fox News Digital on Saturday, Mike Pompeo revealed that he lost in excess of 90lb (41kg) over the past six months after making wholesale lifestyle changes following his exit from the Trump administration last year. The interview came after photos of a slimmed-down Pompeo emerged over the weekend, renewing speculation that the former secretary of state is seriously considering a 2024 presidential run.  Pompeo – whose diminished profile in his regular Fox News appearances was not lost on the channel’s dedicated viewers – went out of his way to point out that he lost the weight himself, through self-guided workouts and more disciplined dietary habits and not with surgery or help from any fitness professionals. There’s certainly no denying Pompeo’s physical transformation. But his claims that he lost the weight through minor diet and exercise changes have created controversy among nutritionists and fitness industry professionals – none of whom believe such dramatic weight loss would be possible without major life changes. “Ninety [pounds] in six [months] is unbelievable,” one fitness expert alleged in the Kansas City Star, “especially for his age.” The 58-year-old claimed he lost the weight because he “stopped eating carbs to a large extent”, and “tried to eat smaller portions”. Pompeo says he built a gym in the basement of his home and outfitted it with some dumbbells and an elliptical machine. “I tried to get down there five, six times a week and stay at it for a half-hour or so,” he told the Post. “And that was nothing scientific. There was no trainer, there was no dietician. It was just me.” Away from the job now he says he now opts for healthier options like egg whites and turkey bacon instead of pumpkin pancakes during family trips to Ihop. Pompeo insists he’s paring down for his health, not a presidential run. But unlike ex-New Jersey governor Chris Christie (who shed 100lb in a year after Lap-Band surgery) or New York City mayor Eric Adams (who flaunts his vegan diet), Pompeo – in his two interviews on the subject – seems intent on making the point that his fitness journey was the product of good ol’ fashion manly-man bootstrapping. There’d be little reason to doubt Pompeo if he weren’t also a historically unreliable narrator who has mislead the public on everything from his administration’s support of the US’s controversial Afghan exit strategy to the Saudi government’s role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi to the overly lavish gifts he received from foreign dignitaries. Not only being cagey about his own weight loss, but he’s making his results sound attainable. “Now from a stress standpoint, he no longer has to work for Trump, so that may be something that allows him access to a helluva lot less stress so he doesn’t keep weight on because of that,” said Milo Bryant, a 30-year fitness veteran and author of the forthcoming book Unstoppable After 40, who’s never had a client come close to Pompeo’s alleged fat burn rate. Pompeo isn’t the first politician to pimp their fitness. George HW Bush, a passionate runner, made regular use of an Air Force One treadmill during long international flights. Bill Clinton turned to street jogging after undergoing quadruple bypass surgery. Mike Huckabee moved to address his health after a chair collapsed under him in a cabinet meeting and he received a type-2 diabetes diagnosis. The erstwhile Republican presidential candidate lost 100lb, but unlike Pompeo acknowledged it was through a drastic diet change and long-distance running. “I would love to know the totality of what [Pompeo] did,” said Bryant. “For someone to lose 90 pounds in six months, you’re talking 15 pounds a month on average. No research shows it’s healthy to lose two and four pounds per week. Four times four is 16 pounds. It’s possible that it could happen, but I don’t see it happening by only working out 30 minutes a day.”",News/US news,Mike Pompeo says he lost over 90lb – but experts are skeptical about his fitness journey,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/mike-pompeo-weight-loss-diet-exercise-experts
1/11/2022,"Joe Biden has styled himself as a defender of democracy but, critics say, is setting the worst possible example with his choice of envoy to Athens. The US president nominated George Tsunis, a hotel developer and Democratic donor with no diplomatic experience, as US ambassador to Greece.  When Tsunis seeks confirmation at a Senate foreign relations committee hearing on Wednesday, he will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the train wreck that was his last appearance there eight years ago. On that occasion Tsunis was Barack Obama’s nominee for ambassador to Norway. Bumbling and ill-prepared, he admitted that he had never been to Norway and referred to the country as having a president when, as a constitutional monarchy, it does not. Tsunis also claimed that Norway’s Progress party was among “fringe elements” that “spew their hatred” and was criticized by Norway’s government. In fact, the Progress party was part of the governing coalition. The hapless nominee withdrew from consideration after causing dismay among Norwegian Americans and earning ridicule on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 and Comedy Central’s The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Now he is getting a do-over that, critics maintain, he does not deserve. Brett Bruen, who was global engagement director of the Obama White House and recalls Tsunis’s first foray as a “debacle” in which he was “torn to shreds” by Senator John McCain, said: “The notion that he gets a second chance just utterly shocks me because in serious circles of international affairs he’s a punchline.” “So why in the world would you send someone to a significant country like Greece – at a dangerous time – to represent us there who in the eyes of most foreign policy hands can’t keep some fundamental facts straight and does not deserve to be ambassador to Ulaanbaatar, let alone Athens?” A lawyer, developer and philanthropist, Tsunis has donated to both Democrats and Republicans, including more than $1.3m to Obama in 2012. His nomination for the post in Greece maintains a controversial American practice of naming political donors with little or no diplomatic experience as ambassadors. There is said to be disappointment in the state department that Biden, who promised to elevate career diplomats, has chosen a majority of political appointees in his first year in office. Bruen, now president the public affairs agency Global Situation Room, added: “Tsunis is likely the worst nominee that Biden has put forward and there’s some stiff competition because Biden has ignored the advice and the concerns of those with diplomatic experience, saying now is not the time to be doling out party favors to your donors. “We need to have serious seasoned leadership in our embassies overseas. The whole nomination process reeks of backroom deals and favor trading but this is what Biden said he was going to clean up.” Last month, when Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, admitted on Twitter that he would rather be serving in government than tweeting, Bruen replied: “Something’s seriously wrong with Biden’s selection process when those with absolutely no diplomatic experience are leading large embassies and seasoned ambassadors are sitting on the sidelines, ready to serve …” Tsunis, a Greek American born in Queens, New York, founded Chartwell Hotels and chairs the Battery Park City Authority, which manages a 92-acre planned development on Manhattan’s lower west side. The White House has defended his nomination, noting that Tsunis is fluent in Greek, involved in Greek American organizations and has travelled to Greece many times.An administration official said: “We believe Mr Tsunis is well-suited for this position and the Senate should confirm quickly so he can get started on the important work to be done.” But Chas Freeman, a retired career diplomat and former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told the Reuters news agency last year: “Aside from his Greek heritage, there is no reason to believe he is any more qualified to represent the United States in Athens than he was in Oslo. “Our embassy in Athens should not be treated as a sinecure to be purchased in return for campaign contributions or as a training ground for novice diplomats, still less incompetent amateurs.” Biden pledged to rebuild the state department and help diplomacy recover from the turmoil of Donald Trump’s presidency. But Senate Republicans have stalled the confirmation process in an effort to extract policy and personnel concessions from the White House, leaving many crucial posts unfilled. Wednesday’s Senate hearing will also consider the nominations of Amy Gutmann to be ambassador to Germany, Donald Blome to be ambassador to Pakistan, Christopher Hill to be ambassador to Serbia and former senator Joseph Donnelly to be ambassador to the Holy See. When the questioning begins, Tsunis will be under considerable pressure to avoid the stumbles that made his first hearing in 2014 a subject of widespread mockery. Dennis Jett, a professor at the Penn State School of International Affairs in Pennsylvania, said: “It was the most pathetic hearing performance I’ve ever seen. He couldn’t even answer a softball asking what would American businessmen do in Norway? “And then the fact that he didn’t know anything about the Norwegian government, didn’t know anything about the political parties involved, which McCain pointed out. It was just awful. I think his qualifications are laughable. “Somehow we in the United States have this impression that anybody who’s a successful money-grubbing businessman can be a first-class ambassador or an acceptable ambassador. It’s laughable. It’s been demonstrated over and over again that these people don’t know anything about government.” Jett, a former US ambassador to Mozambique and Peru and author of the book American Ambassadors, shares concerns over the diplomatic positions being subject to a pay-to-play system. “We’re the only country in the world that has an open market for selling the title of ambassador,” he added.",News/US news,‘He’s a punchline’: ‘laughable’ pick for Greece envoy puts pressure on Biden,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/joe-biden-george-tsunis-greece-ambassador
1/11/2022,"David Sassoli, the president of the European parliament whose final political intervention had been to oppose the building of walls on the EU’s borders, has been praised for his kindness following his death at the age of 65. The former journalist, whose three-year term as speaker of the chamber was due to end next week, had been admitted to hospital in Aviano, in his native Italy, on Boxing Day following a “dysfunction of his immune system”. He died at 1.15am on Tuesday.  In an address posted on social media three days before being hospitalised, Sassoli, a centre-left Italian Democrat, had spoken of his hope for the year to come but lamented the construction of walls that “block people who seek shelter”, in an apparent reference to the plight of refugees stuck between Poland and Belarus. “Our challenge is to build a new world that respects people and nature and believes in a new economy based not just on the profits for the few but on well being for all,” Sassoli had said.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, tweeted in Italian: “I am deeply saddened by the death of a great European and Italian. Sassoli was a passionate journalist, an extraordinary president of the European parliament and above all a dear friend. My thoughts go out to his family. Rest in peace, dear David.” Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, described Sassoli, who had first been elected to the European parliament in 2009, as “a man of the institutions, a profound pro-European”. Frans Timmermans, the European Commission vice-president, tweeted: “David Sassoli, EP president and dear friend, has died. I’m at a loss for words. His kindness was an inspiration to all who knew him. My heartfelt sympathies to his family and all his loved ones. Addio amico mio.” Sassoli had been in hospital since 26 Decemberwith “a serious complication due to a dysfunction of the immune system”. The former television newsreader had struggled with ill-health since being taken to hospital in Strasbourg in September where he had been treated for a severe case of pneumonia caused by legionella. “David Sassoli passed away at 1.15am on 11 January at the CRO in Aviano, Italy, where he was hospitalized,” his spokesperson Roberto Cuillo tweeted. He is survived by his wife, Alessandra, an architect, and two children, Giulio and Livia. Born in Florence, Sassoli had started his journalistic career on local newspapers before joining the staff of Il Giorno, for whom he reported from Rome. He moved to the Italian national television broadcaster RAI in 1992, where he would become a nationally known anchor presenting the main evening news. He was tempted into politics by Walter Veltroni, a former mayor of Rome who became the first leader of the Democratic party when it was formed in 2007. Between 2009 to 2014, Sassoli was the party’s head of delegation in the European parliament before becoming the surprise compromise choice for president of the chamber in 2019 following a division of the big EU institutional jobs in the wake of that year’s elections. Sassoli was a member of the chamber’s Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second-biggest grouping after the centre-right European People’s party (EPP). MEPs are expected to hold the first round of voting for his successor next week. Roberta Metsola, a Maltese member of the EPP who is set to replace Sassoli, tweeted: “I am heartbroken.

1/11/2022,"Dan Smith doesn’t know how to switch off. In the decade or so that he has been the creative heart, and frontman, of the band Bastille, he has thought about music constantly. There was a two-week period over Christmas and new year where he thought he had managed not to. Then he went to a double bill at the cinema. “I got the whole way through the first film and three-quarters of the way through the second film before I had to leave, sing into my phone in the corridor awkwardly, and then come back in,” he says. “If I have a song idea that pops into my head, I have to get it down. It will eat away at me if I forget it, or it’s just on loop in my head.”  This may be testament to Smith’s catchy hooks. Since the release of Bastille’s first album, it has been a decade of No 1s, award nominations and sell-out tours. Commercial success was swift, although critical acclaim followed more slowly. A fourth album, Give Me the Future, is released next month. Yet, despite this objective success, sitting in the control room of Bastille’s studio with his ankle resting on his knee, Smith says he has a “very low opinion” of himself. “I can’t really explain it,” he says. “I think there’s dissonance in my head between what we’ve achieved and how I’m perceived, and the reality in my head.” Smith, 35, is impossible not to like. We speak twice, first over Zoom before Christmas when he is isolating with Covid at home, then in the unassuming studio building, tucked behind a car showroom in south London. After greeting me, he is away, chatting freely about parties with his university friends for New Year’s Eve, “hangxiety”, insomnia, diets and how much he loved spending Christmas with his family (especially his young nephews), often interrupting himself with overlapping tangents, his broad hand gestures to emphasise points. He is affable, funny – and touchingly hospitable (“I’m sorry if you think I’m trying to drown you,” he says after offering to get me water for a fourth time). When he talks about the pressures of being in a band – touring, criticism, fame, performance anxiety, onstage panic attacks – he does so with humour and an explicit caveat about how privileged he is to do what he does. With his fastidious modesty and painstaking self-awareness, he is very much the millennial frontman. “I’ve never been good at trying to pretend to be like this slick, rock star frontman, because it’s not what I ever wanted to be,” he says. “I see other artists who are so good at that – and it’s a skill in itself – but it’s just not one that I’m that interested in.” Smith isn’t keen on interviews or photoshoots (“Just to warn you, I have no control over my face,” he says, deadpan, approaching the photographer). He seems at ease today, although he tells me his university friends still find it hilarious that someone as introverted as him is the lead singer of a mainstream band. Smith grew up in south London with his lawyer parents and sister. He had a happy childhood, he says, but he was a self-conscious child and never dreamed of a musical career. “Just the idea of standing up in front of people and doing anything, let alone playing music, was so far from anything I could imagine wanting to do.” As a teenager, Smith wrote songs on his piano and laptop in his bedroom, but kept them to himself. Then, at university, friends encouraged him to join a talent contest (he was runner up). Pub gigs and open mic nights followed, but he experienced severe stage fright. “I was so nervous. I was such a wreck,” he says. “I used to drink quite a lot before going on, which was not conducive with having to hit a loop pedal and keep time with yourself. It was a nightmare.” In 2010, after finishing university, Smith formed Bastille with Chris Wood, Kyle Simmons and Will Farquarson. The band released an EP independently and built up a loyal following, touring the country in borrowed cars. The band’s first album, Bad Blood, was written in Smith’s bedroom and produced with a friend. “It couldn’t really have been more DIY if it tried,” he says. Even when they signed a record deal he never thought they would be successful. “We were never hyped; we weren’t being told we were going to be successful. So it was news to us. It was news to our record label, and to everyone!” But when Bad Blood was released in 2013 it debuted at No 1 in the UK albums chart and became the biggest-selling digital album of that year. Its anthemic earworm, Pompeii, went platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. Critics hated it. “It was rinsed!” Smith says, laughing. “It’s such a cliche, but you can hear 100 nice things and you remember the one that’s not. It’s such a human thing. And maybe it’s an anxious-person thing to fixate on the negative.” Critics were kinder to later albums Wild World (another UK No 1) and Doom Days (which peaked at No 4 in the UK), and in 2015 the band were nominated for a Grammy. But this intense, sudden rise to fame “freaked out” the fame-averse Smith, who is happy with the fact that many people have heard Bastille’s music, but have no idea what he looks like. “I was hugely self-deprecating as a defence mechanism,” he says. “I was always such a huge pessimist. We all worked so hard on the band at the beginning – and continue to – because we loved it. But I’ve always been expecting it to fall apart at any moment. I think that’s why I never think too far in the future.” Smith has a complicated relationship with his appearance, partly, he thinks, from being overweight as a teenager. “I was big through the end of childhood and through quite a lot of university,” he says. “I’m really aware of not wanting to imply that anyone shouldn’t want to be big. But I remember being just really self-conscious and wanting to look different.” Before his third year at university, he went travelling in Thailand and caught a virus. He lost his appetite and the weight fell off. When he returned home he started eating more healthily and exercised more. That summer, his weight dropped six stone. “When I lost loads of weight and suddenly just looked like a different person, it’s quite a … I think for anyone that’s gone through quite a big, radical physical transformation it can be a fair thing to get your head around.” He doesn’t want people to think this was a magical or aspirational transformation. “It didn’t suddenly instil me with loads of confidence,” he says. “For a long time, I still identified as a bigger guy, and still do to this day.” Smith says he has never felt pressure from the music industry to change his weight, but his body dysmorphia meant the constant exposure to seeing his own face – in videos, photographs or artwork – has been tricky to navigate. “It’s a bizarre line of work in which you are constantly confronted by your own image,” he says. “It’s not fun – and it doesn’t feel particularly healthy. “I think a lot of people suffer from different versions of body dysmorphia,” he says. “We all have the version of ourselves that we see in our own heads and often that’s so different from the version of who we are through other people’s eyes.” It makes being on stage uncomfortable. “For someone who has body image issues, it’s complicated getting up on stage every night in front of lots of people, when your instinct is to hide away,” Smith says. “Sometimes it’s not a problem, sometimes it is.” Smith has never needed to drink before getting on stage to perform with Bastille, but it is still a nerve-racking, isolating experience even with his bandmates beside him. “It’s really up in the air as to whether or not I’ll have a good show or not because I get really nervous,” he says. “I have this really unhelpful thing where I go pitch deaf on stage – so I can hear noise, but can’t place anything – and then I become really self-conscious about not singing in tune, because you can’t hear what’s going on. “I remember playing at Alexandra Palace [in north London] – which should have been such an amazing moment – and two songs in I just lost it and went completely pitch deaf and the whole gig for me was then this mad, terrifying rollercoaster of just trying to get through it. I hear myself saying this and it’s just a real shame.” Performing, in other words, is what he has to do to fulfil his passion of writing, recording and working with other creative people. He wishes he could enjoy it, and is honoured that fans come to see him, but his stage fright is “essentially a form of a panic attack”. Bastille’s fourth album leans heavily into Smith’s fondness for sci-fi (he talks fervently about the films Brazil, Minority Report and Ghost in the Shell, and the writers Philip K Dick and Margaret Atwood). He made his directorial debut for the music video to No Bad Days, exploring themes of resurrecting loved ones through technology. The song was inspired by Smith’s aunt, who died of cancer a few years ago. “She happened to live in a state in Australia where they just legalised assisted dying and she was one of the first people to go down that path,” he says. He was able to travel to see her before she died. “To me, she’s amazing for having taken that decision and was so amazingly generous at helping guide all the people around her that she loved through this incredibly difficult situation.” In the past 10 years, Smith has rarely taken time off. Even during lockdown last year he didn’t slow down, spending his days finishing the latest album, running an online film club and volunteering at food banks and vaccination centres. In the evenings he wrote more music, like he did as a student (“which I loved”). And when he’s not with Bastille, Smith is collaborating with others and enjoying being “a small part in this much bigger thing”. He has written songs for artists (including Yungblud, Lizzo and Haim); scored films (his latest is the upcoming From Devil’s Breath, a short film produced by Leonardo DiCaprio), and worked with other musicians through Bastille’s record label and studio, One Eyed Jack, which the band set up to offer a free space for other (often emerging) artists to use. He is also co-hosting a BBC Sounds podcast with books enthusiast Simon Savidge, Turn Up for the Books, out this week, and is working on a full-blown musical with two of his friends. What does he do to switch off? Marathons, naturally. Doesn’t he worry about burnout? “Massively!” Smith says. “But I think because we started in a place where I was involved with every single bit, and was determined to not leave that, I’ve just stayed involved in everything to the point where it can be consuming. I think, at points, I’ve just taken on way too much.” With all the success that Bastille has experienced, has his “brutal critical narrative” quietened down? “I think there’s a small part of me that’s really, really conditioned to think that way,” he says. “But I think I’ve seen some of that negativity beaten out of me by the fact that it’s 10 years on, and we’re still allowed to do this stuff.” And as long as he’s able to keep doing it, he is happy. “Recording has always been the thing I do for fun,” he says. “The studio is the bit I love. Touring and all the other things that come with being in a band are just a side point to making songs, writing songs and creating something out of nothing. Which, for me and my basic little brain, is really satisfying.” Give Me the Future is released on EMI on 4 February. Bastille tour the UK in March and April. The Turn Up for the Books podcast is on BBC Sounds from 12 January.",Arts/Music,"‘I’ve been expecting things to fall apart at any moment’: Dan Smith on 10 years of body dysmorphia, burnout and Bastille",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/11/ive-been-expecting-things-to-fall-apart-at-any-moment-dan-smith-on-10-years-of-body-dysmorphia-burnout-and-bastille
