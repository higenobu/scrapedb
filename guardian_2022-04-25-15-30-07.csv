4/25/2022,"It may not come naturally to you but many businesses are open to haggling, so do not rule it out. They want to make a sale, even if the profit margin is slightly lower, so a displayed price tag isn’t necessarily the final price. No contract has been formed until money has changed hands. The worst that can happen from haggling is being told no by a salesperson. Earlier this year, Which? surveyed broadband customers found the ones who had haggled had saved an average of £85 a year – a discount of 20%. The saving was even bigger for people who have a combined broadband and TV package: £128 a year on average. Jenny Ross, the Which? Money editor, says that in its online shopping research it found people could sometimes obtain discounts of up to 20% from popular retailers just by asking for a better price on the company’s online chat function. She adds: “You could save money on your next holiday, too, by haggling with your travel agent or calling your hotel directly instead of settling for the price online. This could result in a discount, free upgrade or even a bottle of champagne on arrival.” Have as much information as possible at your fingertips when you start your negotiation. For example, look at competitors’ prices using comparison websites such as Google Shopping, Kelkoo and PriceRunner. Michelle Bailey, who writes the Time and Pence blog, haggled £600 off the price of new windows and doors by speaking to several firms and seeing what prices they charged. Or Goren, the editor of the Cord Busters blog, says: “Before you call, write down two numbers – the maximum you’re willing to pay and the lowest you’re willing to pay. These numbers should guide your haggling.” He advises that if you stay focused and within the limits you have set, you are more likely to win. Have the cost in mind but also consider what you could also accept. Could the company throw in something that would make the deal better for you? Batteries? Sofa cushions? A couple of extra contract months? However, Claire Stitt of the website Stapo’s thrifty life hacks says you should think about what you actually want and need. “There’s no point in a phone contract with 500 text messages a month if you usually only send 10,” she says. A haggled deal is a win-win. The trader gets a sale they might otherwise not have made, and you get a good price. Try to show the trader the beneficial impact the sale could have in future. Shilpa Panchmatia is a retired entrepreneur, teaching people how to grow their business. When booking a hotel deal for a conference, she pointed out that she would be bulk-booking rooms every month for a whole year and got the manager to waive the room hire charge. “The secret was to show the [manager] the bigger picture and how he would benefit,” she says. Think about bulk-booking rooms for an overnight stay for a wedding, for example – a venue might offer a discount in return for having a guaranteed number of rooms booked. Try going to a store during its quiet time, when no one is under pressure to move you on. If you are buying a car, go to the showroom towards the end of the month, possibly on the last Thursday. Becky Derbyshire, who runs the Lifestyle Blogger UK website, recently haggled on her Ford Fiesta. She says the salespeople are often desperate to hit monthly targets, so may well lower prices. Polly Arrowsmith has haggled for years, including with companies such as Harrods and Prada. Her successful negotiations include getting hundreds of pounds off a dishwasher and furniture. Many of her wins have come from knowing when the sales are coming, so she knows retailers will be ready to reduce their margins. Be cool, calm, polite and assertive. Say that you are a cash buyer or can pay today, to show that you are serious. Importantly, make sure you start the haggling process with the person who has the authority to make deals. Keep it good-humoured. People are more open to persuasion if you make them feel good rather than trying to beat them down in price. Make them want to help you. If it’s a no or you can’t get the desired discount, accept gracefully, thanking the person you are talking to for their consideration. At some point you may be back to haggle on something else. Often if you threaten to leave a company when a contract or subscription comes to an end you will be made an offer to stay. Don’t just accept it – look at what offers are available for new customers and request one for being a loyal customer. Insurers are now banned from quoting policyholders a higher price to renew their home or motor insurance than they would offer a new customer. But that does not mean that what you are being offered is the cheapest price. So tell your provider about the comparison site prices that they must beat. If you need to complain about a service, such as problems with your broadband, request a discount as well as redress. I did this recently and got six months’ fees refunded, a free year’s upgrade and a wifi booster. Shops are typically charged 1-4% of the transaction value when you pay for something with a credit or debit card. Although traders may have to pay for putting cash into a bank, it may be a lower cost, so it is worth offering as part of your conversation. Brad Burton is a motivational business speaker who founded Network Central, a business networking organisation. He says it can be far easier to haggle with smaller businesses because they have the flexibility that comes from a smaller chain of command and are often hungrier for the sale. “When it comes to negotiation, offering immediate or short payment terms is always a good starting point to help any cashflow problems,” he says. “Don’t make unreasonable offers. Understand that any business has to make a profit and that they are offering a product or service you want and/or need – so be respectful.”",Lifestyle/Money,"How to haggle for the best deal, from broadband to travel",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/25/how-to-haggle-best-deal-broadband-travel-lower-price
4/25/2022,"Mornings are the worst time for Fayness Alpha. Her children wail from hunger most often when they wake up, she says. Alpha was 15 when she first arrived at Dzaleka – a refugee camp in Dowa, 40km from Malawi’s capital Lilongwe – having been forced from her home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by bandit attacks. A decade later, she is married with three children. But, like thousands of others, she is unable to find work in the camp or to leave, rendering her dependent on rations provided by the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP). But the WFP – underfunded and facing pressure from other emergencies – “re-evaluated” the needs of the camp’s inhabitants. Alpha was among hundreds who found themselves removed from the list for receiving monthly food supplies. Many say this has left them destitute. “My husband and I are jobless and depend on rations to survive. Ever since we were taken off the list, life has been very hard and we’re just surviving on the grace of God,” says Alpha. “Life is complicated now, and as you can see my children are crying because of hunger. We’re living a difficult and painful life.” She has appealed to WFP staff to reconsider her situation. The UN conducted a household “vulnerability profiling exercise” of 10,846 refugee and asylum-seeker households in Dzaleka in 2020. Ranking households by income and need, it determined that 678 had found alternative livelihoods, making them food secure. But many of those who found themselves removed say they are baffled as to why. Dzaleka was established 25 years ago in response to an increase in the number of people fleeing genocide and wars in Burundi, Rwanda and DRC. With an initial capacity for 10,000 people, the camp now houses about 50,000. Malawi is again seeing new arrivals of people pushed by conflicts, civil unrest and political and economic instability across the region. About 600 people came after being displaced by Mozambique’s floods in February. Paul Turnbull, WFP director for Malawi, says the growing number of people in the camp is stretching resources. “In the current economic context, especially with the conflict in Ukraine, funding is very difficult. “WFP appreciates the support it gets from its funding partners to provide food assistance to refugees in Malawi and elsewhere. The number of refugees in Dzaleka camp has more than doubled since 2013. With limited access to business opportunities, WFP assistance is the primary source of food for most people. Alternative sources of livelihoods in the camp have also been affected by the pandemic,” he says. More than half of those removed from the list have appealed to the WFP, including Elie Zagabe, 37, who escaped from war in DRC 16 years ago. He enrolled for community learning and eventually found a job helping out in a primary school. But he earns a minimum amount and believes his family’s food rations have been taken away because of a mistake. “I lost my position [on the list] because the two children are seriously sick. Last two weeks, the second-born was very sick and admitted at Dowa clinic with pneumonia. I think this is because of the cold here at the camp. I was with the child at the hospital while my wife was taking care of the other child at home. “The people who were doing the survey didn’t approach me. I found them at my neighbour’s place and I told them to reach my home but they said since they had seen me we could interact right there.” He says others he knows on the same salary have stayed on the list, and his attempt to appeal against the decision has been in vain. “I’m living in a desperate situation. We sometimes spend the night without food. My children cry of hunger and I have nowhere to turn to. We might die of hunger,” he says. Of the 325 households who appealed, WFP says 103 are eligible to be “reprofiled” using the same vulnerability questionnaire used in 2020, although this does not guarantee being reinstated on the list.

4/25/2022,"The Museum: A Short History of Crisis and Resilience was a book born out of the pandemic. Originally conceived in early 2020 as a look at the current state of museums and where they were headed in the future, the project took on a new meaning – and a new trajectory – as the coronavirus swept across the globe. “Like a lot of people, I started to think back to the 1918 flu epidemic,” author Samuel Redman said to the Guardian. “I was surprised to learn that not many people had written about how that pandemic had impacted museums. As Covid continued to spread, I just couldn’t stop thinking about how museums had dealt with crisis moments in the past and how that would inform the current crisis and problems they’d face in the future.” What emerged from that moment is a slender, taut work of scholarship that explores how museums have responded to crises both external and internal, beginning with the massive 1865 fire at the Smithsonian. In addition to the Smithsonian fire and the Spanish flu, Redman also looks at cataclysms like the Great Depression, the second world war, the coronavirus and the national protests following the death of George Floyd, as well as more existential crises like the culture wars of the 1980s and 90s and museums’ own legacies as agents of colonialism and exploitation. Across the sweep of these various pivot points, The Museum distills the core values and unique contributions that have allowed this institution to stay vital – and relatively consistent – throughout decades of transformation. For Redman, emergencies are the perfect moment to name these elusive qualities, as they are times when museums are forced to confront basic questions about their priorities, their core constituencies and their essential tasks. “During crises, museums ask questions about power and who gets to determine what stories are told or foregrounded, who gets to determine how those things are exhibited, framed, and talked about,” he said. “One of the reasons I became so interested in crisis is because these periods make acute questions about what museums should be. They suddenly go from being abstract questions to being very concrete and real.” When it comes to these pivot points, not all are of the same usefulness. Redman judges that the Smithsonian fire and the Great Depression instigated fundamental changes in how museums operate, whereas the 1918 pandemic and the 1970s art strike – a New York–based artists’ movement against racism, sexism and the Vietnam war – failed to inspire much lasting change or self-reflection. Overall, Redman judges that museums have done relatively well in meeting crisis moments, proving to be very resilient institutions that have stood the test of time while other fixtures of 19th-century life have long been forgotten. One of the fascinating insights of The Museum is that as museums have become more long-lived institutions in American cultural life, their crises have become more existential and inward-focused. In earlier eras, the crises that predominated among museums tended to be the likes of fires that destroyed buildings and priceless artifacts, or wars and economic upheaval that shuttered society and sapped its resources. But as society transformed, with museums proliferating and developing an institutionalized status as purveyors of truth, they began to confront different kinds of crises altogether, injecting large doses of politics and culture wars into their operations. Redman exemplifies these new sorts of existential emergencies with the attempted Smithsonian exhibition of the Enola Gay, the infamous plane that dropped an atomic weapon on Hiroshima. Planned for 1995, the 50th anniversary of the bombing, the exhibition was originally conceived to contextualize the Enola Gay with a frank admission of the horror and tragedy that it brought, including photographs of victims of the atomic bomb that were enlarged and displayed to seem as though they were staring into the faces of museum-goers. However, the debate around what the Los Angeles Times called the “most controversial exhibit ever staged” became so acrimonious that the exhibit only emerged in radically truncated form, a meek display of the fuselage of the Enola Gay, and nothing more. Looking back on this disappointing episode, Redman concludes that museums that “leaned into” such culture war controversies, using them to “more deeply consider their role in society” and “seek ways to thoughtfully take on difficult subjects”, tended to emerge from the 80s and 90s more powerful and resilient. Whereas the early chapters of The Museum read as more scholarly and informational, as Redman moves up through the arts strike of the 70s, the culture wars that closed out last century, and the new challenges of the past two decades, the book takes on a tone that pleasingly blends scholarship with Redman’s personal voice. Although he largely writes with a historian’s distanced, impartial prose, Redman does become more assertive as he moves closer to the moments of the present day, seemingly more comfortable airing his own opinion. Discussing protests following the death of George Floyd, as well as the riot at the Capitol following the incendiary speech given by Donald Trump, his frustration is apparent, and he challenges museums to reckon with their own pasts and seize their destiny as truth-purveyors for the communities around them. In order to do this, museums must jump into national debates while they are going on, and on that score Redman expects much improvement. “There’s a lot of room for critique,” he told me, “and I hope that museums continue to foreground questions about race and racism in their collections. I hope this doesn’t turn out to be a single episode but rather is a longer and more continued practice of dealing with questions of racism. There has been resistance to making these statements permanent. I hope there’s a larger re-examination of museums’ priorities.” Redman added that, in addition to considering questions of systemic racism, “it’s important for museums to foreground LGBT history in the face of bills like the ‘don’t say gay’ bill in Florida.” Perhaps more than anything, The Museum demonstrates that crises come in multiple, often unexpected forms, and that past is not necessarily indicative of future. Knowing that, what pivot points does Redman think lie in wait for museums? “It could be anything,” he said. “The Spanish flu was so forgotten in museum memory, because there was so much else going on at that time. So that meant that, when Covid emerged, we weren’t really thinking about, what if there’s another major pandemic? We can see some crises around the corner, but we can’t fully anticipate what challenges lie waiting for us. Future crises really could be anything, and that, I hope, is one of the points that this book makes clear.” The Museum: A Short History of Crisis and Resilience Hardcover is released on 3 May",Arts/Books,The art of resilience: how the museum has endured through crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/25/the-museum-samuel-redman-book-covid-coronavirus
4/25/2022,"Sometimes, when she reaches the sanctuary of her hotel room after 24 hours on duty, Suzanne Watkins finds herself laughing uncontrollably. This has happened in South Korea, Guam, Japan and Ireland – all since last November when, on her 60th birthday, she passed her flight attendant training. “I knew the only way I could explore the world economically was to get paid to fly,” she says. “And I knew I had to do it at 60, because I didn’t want to do it at 70.” Watkins works long-haul at short notice, with an ad hoc schedule. The lifestyle would horrify some, but she says she feels “most at peace with myself when I am a stranger in a strange land and I am wandering”. So she has given up her rented apartment, downsized and squeezed everything she owns into a 5ft by 10ft storage unit. “And that’s all I have,” she says. “It’s exciting, not knowing where I’m going, what I’m going to do.” She stays with friends and family when she is not travelling. After Watkins and her husband divorced in 2008, she always knew where she was going. She raised their daughter, then 14, and son, eight, as a single parent in Sebastopol, California. “Economically, I scrambled. I had three minimum-wage jobs.” These included working in a toy shop and planning travel for non-profit school organisations. Life settled into a necessary pattern. “You drive to the office, you sit at a computer all day, you go home, sleep, and do it all over again.” Watkins was still in this mode in 2018, when she was taken to ER with a life-threatening sepsis infection. “They had to remove half my intestines. It made me realise that I’m mortal,” she says. “Sometimes that’s what it takes.” After the surgery, Watkins recovered at home, and for the first time in a decade her relentless working rhythm was put on pause. “I saw things I had never even seen in my own home before – noticing the lamp on the ceiling, or the birds outside. I had never taken the time.” One day, in this frame of mind, she was listening to the radio. Entrepreneur Chip Conley was talking about his new project: Modern Elder Academy, which is billed as a “midlife wisdom school”, in Baja California, Mexico. Watkins applied for a scholarship. “As a single mom, it was the only way I could do it.” She was still wearing her post-surgery colostomy bag when she went to the MEA campus in February 2018 for a week of “transformational workshops and active listening … I felt like I was taking a big deep breath in for the first time, and then just letting it out,” Watkins says. She had had an unsettled, anxious childhood. She loved looking through National Geographic magazine, which was always on the coffee table, but her parents “were not travellers in any way, shape or form”, though the family moved a dozen times. Watkins sent off for brochures about places but never went, and drew pictures of aeroplanes. At university, she studied geography. Once she got to Modern Elder Academy, she realised she needed to find a job that involved travel. When the pandemic shut the skies in 2020, Watkins read of flight attendants being laid off. Counterintuitively, her own plans grew wings. She applied to be a flight attendant, and graduated after five weeks of training. “I don’t want to have any regrets on my deathbed. So I wake up every morning and I say, ‘If today was my last day, would I be OK?’, and I say ‘Yes’.” Before her illness, she says, “I was complacent. And complacency and old age – it doesn’t work. It’s not uplifting. I think it’s important as an older adult to keep pushing the limits. Don’t think of your life linearly.” She opens out her hands. “Think of it as continuing to unfold. And you can have surprises and joy.” Her children, too, appreciate her differently. “I think they saw me as afraid, not a risk-taker, when they were younger. Now they’ve seen me go through a lot of transformation. I can finally be a role model for them to show that it’s OK to follow your heart.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I trained to be a flight attendant – it’s the only way I could explore the world’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/25/a-new-start-after-60-i-trained-to-be-a-flight-attendant-its-the-only-way-i-could-explore-the-world

4/25/2022,"Amazon workers in New York will go to the polls again as labor activists push to unionize a second facility in the US following their surprise recent victory over the tech giant. About 1,500 eligible workers at an LDJ5 Amazon sorting center in Staten Island, New York, begin voting in a union election on Monday, in a process that will continue through 29 April. Ballot-counting starts on 2 May. Amazon has aggressively opposed unionization among its workforce, which totals about 1.1 million people in the US alone. The fight comes as workers at other major corporations including Starbucks are fighting to unionize. Amazon has spent millions hiring union avoidance consultants. Amazon Labor Union (ALU) organizers have alleged harassment and intimidation from management. The company is vigorously contesting its first loss and has accused ALU of using “objectionable, coercive, and misleading behavior”, to convince workers to support them. Among other objections, Amazon claims the vote should be overturned because ALU “intentionally created hostile confrontations” and offered marijuana to workers in an “impermissible grant of support” for workers’ votes, according to filings obtained by the New York Times. The sorting center is right across the street from the JFK8 warehouse where workers won a historic first union election at Amazon in the US on 1 April. It is the second union election petition filed by the ALU, an independent group of current and former Amazon workers with no affiliation with established labor unions and led by the former Amazon worker Chris Smalls.

Ahead of the election, ALU hosted a rally featuring speeches from Senator Bernie Sanders and union leaders, including the AFA-CWA international president, Sara Nelson, and Sean O’Brien, president of the powerful Teamsters International, which is also pushing to unionize Amazon. ALU organizers who work at LDJ5 have said they experienced similar anti-union efforts by Amazon, and have filed multiple unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. “This employer has been engaging in sustained unlawful union busting. Amazon has violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by forcing employees to attend captive audience meetings, disciplining organizers for protected union activities, and prohibiting the union from displaying its banner in the break rooms,” said Seth Goldstein, a pro bono attorney representing the ALU. The union has joined with the American Federation of Teachers and New York State United Teachers in filing a complaint with the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, alleging that Amazon’s anti-union efforts are in violation of the provisions of the New York state Excelsior Jobs Program, and pushing for Amazon to pay back $400m in tax breaks they received through the program.",News/Technology,Amazon labor organizers push for second union victory in New York,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/25/amazon-union-labor-organizers-new-york
4/25/2022,"Lockdown was, among other things, a sudden collective experiment in volume control. Sound waves from the regular rush-hour thrum of cities usually penetrate more than a kilometre below the Earth’s surface. When Covid-19 forced humans inside, seismologists noticed the muzak of their subterranean instruments was quieted. The ancient rock of our planet came closer to the silence that it had known for nearly all of the first 4bn years of its existence. And the relative stillness was felt on the surface, too. People noticed voices from beyond the human world a little more readily, and those voices felt less need to shout to be heard. Scientists in San Francisco discovered that the city’s sparrows reverted to softer and lower pitched songs of a kind not heard since the invention of the freeway. Biology professor David George Haskell’s often wonderful book is all about listening to those kinds of lost frequencies. It is a sort of rigorous scientific update on that 1960s imperative to “tune in and turn on”: a reminder that the narrow aural spectrum on which most of us operate, and the ways in which human life is led, blocks out the planet’s great, orchestral richness. Haskell’s previous acclaimed book, The Forest Unseen, was a thrillingly curious investigation of the life of one square metre of ancient Tennessee woodland. This new volume gives you the experience of closing your eyes in such a space and having your senses flooded with the background cacophony. It took our sun a good while, Haskell argues, to work out the means of filling the planet with sound. Eventually it discovered the cymbal crash of life. A microphone in a muted laboratory can pick up the sounds of colonies of bacteria. When these are amplified and played back to the bacterial cultures they grow at an accelerated rate, detecting the noise through cell walls. No one knows how or why. Bacteria had this ultimate chill-out playlist to itself for nearly 2bn years. The first sea creatures were voiceless. The evolutionary quirk that set life on the road to hearing was a “tiny wiggly hair”, a cilium on a cell membrane that allowed organisms to “hear” eddies and changes in water flow that might help them to locate food. Haskell traces, beautifully and brilliantly, the stages from that development to the wonders of human and animal hearing – all the infinite serial interactions between communication and reception. “When we marvel at springtime birdsong, or the vigour of chorusing insects and frogs on a summer evening,” he writes, “we are immersed in the wondrous legacy of the ciliary hair.” Crickets and their ancient relatives were among the prime movers in this evolutionary soundscape. In immersing himself in the mechanics and music of insect song, Haskell transports his reader to imagine the first instruments and notation: he examines the fossil tracery of prototype grasshopper wings, preserved in Permian rock, which clearly reveal the shift from a flat surface to one with an unusual ridge, the gene genie mutation that allowed the insect to create and amplify its sawing sound. Such discoveries lead Haskell to all sorts of places: the development of echolocation, the “hearing feet” of certain species, the insatiable human need to recreate and delight in Caliban’s isle “full of noises”, and the ways in which technology – from antler-horn pipes to reed instruments to digital soundtracks – has often advanced in creating through rhythm and music. The earliest ears of all species were on high alert for novelty – just like teenagers hungry for the newest beats. Some corners of the animal world are richer with this kind of innovation than others. Humpback whales, Haskell writes, concentrate their hit factory in “an innovation zone” off the coast of Australia, where new calls are developed and tested. Once established, the latest humpback songs will have spread throughout the oceans within a few months. Tragically, evidence suggests, this natural wonder has met with brutal interference in recent years: the calls of whales and dolphins can get lost in the “sonic fog” produced by container ships’ engines. Mating and distress calls go unheard. And oil prospectors’ sonic surveys, producing underwater decibel explosions every minute, are thought to have forced whales – enormously sensitive hearing creatures – out of the ocean to escape the torture. Human noise pollution is everywhere on land and Haskell’s investigation into natural sound often takes on the tone of a valedictory lament. He goes in search of wild places – forests at dawn, riverbanks at evening – where the diversity of bird and insect noise is at its overwhelming richest, and contrasts them with the eerie silent springs of pesticide-scoured agrarian landscapes. The ambition to tell the history of our planet through description of sound is given a profound urgency by these chapters. Meanwhile, the sense of what is being lost is revealed in how even the thesaurus of Haskell’s descriptive language struggles to keep up with the nuance and variety of the musical world. You often sense him, as he attempts to convey in words what he is hearing, in the position of Keats: no match for the nightingale.

4/25/2022,"“Terrible compliment” should be an oxymoron. It’s not. I’ve had some absolute corkers. I recently attended a party in a fancy jumpsuit and heels. Someone, with all the kindness in the world, said to me: “You look ever so comfy.” COMFY? I’m grinning through burning arches of agony, bunched toes smooshed into pointed tip-ends. Shoulders stretched back and torso pulled long. I can’t rub my itchy eyes for fear of smearing the slap I’ve caked on. And to top it all off, it’s a jumpsuit with under-Spanx, so I’m holding in about three pints of wee because every trip to the loo is as exhausting as putting up and taking down a family-size tent. Comfy? FML. The same night I overheard someone’s weightlifting described as “heartwarming”. That’s what you say about a cup of tea or a video of a tiger nuzzling a chick. Not to a woman who can deadlift 120kg. That’s heavier than an off-season Arnold Schwarzenegger. Or two and a half Keira Knightleys. What’s made you all fuzzy about that? Why is it so hard to get this right? I wondered if we could blame the recent lockdowns for this social-skill atrophy but I worry it’s always been confusing. I’ve spent a lifetime computing all the ways my body weight and type have been noticed. “Hench” I managed to delight in, eventually, and I even relished a recent “jacked”. I’m still working on a neutral response to “solid”, “sturdy”, “heavy”, “hefty” etc. But know that, even if your heart is full of love when you mention someone’s weight change, your comment is implicitly fatphobic at worst and unhelpful at best. And surely we’re past that now. Elton John once taught us that sorry seems to be the hardest word. But these days I’m afraid it’s been usurped by the absolute hellscape that is any variation of: “You look nice.” Jessica Fostekew is a comedian, actor and writer",Opinion/Opinion,My party outfit was so fancy I couldn’t even use the toilet.

4/25/2022,"Almost half a million UK pensioners living overseas will be left out of pocket by up to £5,600 this year after being excluded from this month’s annual state pension increase. They include the 103-year-old second world war veteran Albert Johnson, one of the last remaining survivors of the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, and his 95-year-old wife, Mary, who are originally from Lincolnshire and now live in Beechboro, Western Australia. They are receiving UK state pensions that are a fraction of what they would get if they had stayed in the UK or moved to one of a list of other countries. The couple are among 492,000 older Britons living abroad who are losing out as a result of the UK’s “frozen pensions” policy. These people’s basic state pensions do not increase every year, as happens in the UK, but stay at the level they were on the date the individual moved away if they had already retired, or became entitled to the payment if they were already living overseas. On 11 April, all UK state pensions and most state benefits went up by 3.1%. As a result, the basic state pension rose by £4.25 to £141.85 a week, while the full new state pension went up by £5.55 to £185.15 a week. This will give UK pensioners a little more protection from the rising cost of living but the 492,000 Britons who emigrated or retired to countries such as Australia, Canada and South Africa will not get a penny extra. Some of the oldest “frozen pensioners” are receiving payments of only £30 to £40 a week, which never go up. For example, a single pensioner who retired in late 1982 after having made the full contributions would be getting £32.85 a week, or £1,708 a year, if their pension was frozen then. If they had stayed in Britain they would now be getting £141.85 a week, or £7,376 a year. The End Frozen Pensions campaign, run by the International Consortium of British Pensioners, says: “Although we welcome the rise in UK pensions, we are hugely disappointed that the UK government is continuing to treat British citizens living in an arbitrary list of countries unfairly.” The UK state pension is payable overseas but it is not “uprated” annually unless there is a legal requirement to do so – for example, where there is a relevant reciprocal social security agreement in place. There are more than 100 countries worldwide where the UK basic state pension is not uprated each year. In addition to the three mentioned previously, they include New Zealand, Thailand and India, plus British overseas territories such as the Falkland Islands. The Johnsons believe the UK government’s policy on this issue is unfair, particularly as Albert gave “six and a half of the best years of my life [to] serving my country”. In 1939, Albert – then aged 20 – was called up for military service, and at the start of 1940 he and a group of other soldiers were sent to France. He was evacuated from Dunkirk and later spent three years fighting in Burma (now Myanmar), during which time he contracted malaria and dysentery. He and Mary met after the second world war when he went to work on the same farm as her. The couple moved to Australia in 1967, when Albert was in his late 40s. His pension was set when he applied for the UK state pension in 1984, when he turned 65, and was awarded 81% of the full entitlement. He receives about £28 a week, while Mary’s pension is approximately £17 a week (their pensions are paid into their bank account monthly – he receives A$199.75 (£113.82) Australian dollars a month, while she receives 119.61 dollars). They also receive a fortnightly payment from the Australian government’s Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which they qualified for because of Albert’s war service. In a similar situation is Patricia Coulthard, who is 100 and relocated to Australia to be closer to her children during her retirement. She receives a pension that is frozen at £46 a week. “I am now nearly 101 years old and, having been born in Britain and served as a nurse in world war two, it saddens me to think the UK government does not believe I am entitled to the same support as other British pensioners living overseas,” she says The Department for Work and Pensions says there is information on Gov.uk about what the effect of going abroad will be on your entitlement to the UK state pension. It adds: “The government’s policy on the uprating of the UK state pension for recipients living overseas is a longstanding one of more than 70 years, and we continue to uprate state pensions overseas where there is a legal requirement to do so.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Frozen pensions: Dunkirk veteran among those losing up to £5,600",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/25/frozen-pensions-dunkirk-veteran-among-those-losing-up-to-5600

4/25/2022,"The Echo Show 15 is Amazon’s biggest Alexa smart display and is designed to be a command centre or digital noticeboard for all the family. It is considerable larger than the rest of Amazon’s Echo Show devices, which were recently given a motorised screen and small desk-ready displays. The Echo Show 15 – which costs £239.99 ($249.99/A$399) – dwarfs them, with its huge 15.6in screen looking more like a picture frame than a piece of technology. That illusion is furthered by its wall-mountable form – it is designed to be hung in a central place like the digital equivalent of the pinboards common to kitchens of homes of the 1980s, and can be mounted in landscape or portrait orientation. It can be bought with a stand for £30 more if you would rather not screw 2.2kg of technology into your wall. The 1080p touchscreen is bright and crisp when viewed at arm’s reach. Its two 1.6in speakers are loud and clear for Alexa’s voice or watching video but only average for music lacking in bass, sounding closer to the budget Echo Dot than the beefier Echo Show 10. It has buttons on the top for volume, muting the microphones and camera, plus a physical privacy shutter for the camera. For the most part it works just like Amazon’s other Alexa smart displays. It answers questions, sets timers, controls smart home devices and shows feeds from Ring doorbells or other compatible cameras. It can also display your photos from Amazon Photos or Facebook, either alongside other content or on their own like a huge digital photo frame, which looks great. Unlike its siblings, the Show 15 can display more than one thing at once, supporting multiple widgets on its home screen alongside the usual time, information and photo display. Widgets can include a yellow sticky note for leaving messages, shared to-do lists, calendars, the weather, Amazon Music controls, recipe ideas and smart home controls. The concept is great but the widgets are a little sluggish in use and lack variety in their size, shape and placement. There needs to be more of them, and I’d like a larger smart home control widget and to be able to put the largest calendar widget at the bottom of the screen, not in the middle. It is a good start but they have some way to go to be a killer feature. Video feeds from security cameras can stream in a floating picture-in-picture window so that you can see who is at the door while doing something else, such as following a recipe, which is handy. The big screen lends itself to being a kitchen TV but only Amazon Prime Video and Netflix have native apps that you can access via voice, such as asking for the latest Bond movie. For everything else you have to use the built-in Silk browser to view them like you would on a laptop. It is a clunky affair but YouTube, BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and All4 work well enough with voice control of play and pause once you have the right video loaded. Some, such as BT Sport, don’t respond to voice controls, while Disney+ will not work in the browser at all. You can play music from Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer or Spotify as well as BBC Sounds and various other radio stations through TuneIn. The Show 15 can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker from your phone or tablet or connected to a third-party speaker. The 5-megapixel camera can recognise the face of the person standing in front of it using Amazon’s new “Visual ID”, which then shows personalised content such as a specific calendar, music account and so on without you having to directly interact with the display or Alexa. It works well, greeting you with the name and a little picture of the person it has recognised, so you can see whose account the information is coming from. The camera can be used for video calls to other Echo Show devices, contacts with the Alexa app or through Skype. It works well enough but can be a bit sluggish to start a call and you can’t currently use Zoom or any other service in the UK yet. You can use it like a security camera, too, viewing its live feed through the Alexa app on your phone. The Echo Show 15 is generally repairable and will receive security updates for at least four years after the device is discontinued. It contains 99% recycled aluminium plus at least 35% recycled plastic. Amazon has also pledged to offset the electricity used by Echo devices with renewable energy. The company offers trade-in and recycling schemes. The Amazon Echo Show 15 costs £239.99 ($249.99/A$399) or £269.98 ($279.98/A$448.95) with a stand. The stand can be bought separately for £29.99. For comparison, the Echo Show 5 costs £44.99, the Echo Show 8 costs £119.99 and Echo Show 10 costs £239.99, while Google’s Nest Hub Max costs £219 and the Nest Hub costs £89.99. The Echo Show 15 is a good smart display with a lot of potential to be a really great one. There is nothing else quite like it on the market, with that big 15.6in screen, picture-frame surround and wall-mounting or stand options. But Amazon has yet to really take advantage of its size, with only a few limited widget and multitasking options. It feels as if it could do so much more as the central digital hub of a home. Alexa responds quickly and does everything it can on Amazon’s smaller displays. The face recognition works well as a way of showing you personalised content without having to directly interact with it. If you want a really big Alexa smart display for the kitchen, the Echo Show 15 is it, priced the same as Amazon’s smaller 10in motorised version. But it isn’t quite the revolution it promises just yet. Pros: Alexa, huge screen, widgets, wall or stand options, face and voice recognition, video calls, Prime Video or Netflix apps, BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and All4 through browser, contains recycled materials. Cons: expensive, speakers not as good as standard Echo, limited widget options, no Zoom in the UK yet, native video and music services are limited to a handful of big ones, browser access to video sites is clunky.

4/25/2022,"Q I am thinking about buying my first house in Cambridge where I currently live. The market here is out of control and I am on my own. This means that with savings and a mortgage I can’t really afford anything decent. Fortunately I have nice friends who would help me by putting some cash towards the deposit. For them, it would be a long-term investment, and either I will repay them at some point in the future or they will get their money back when I sell the house, according to the percentage they put in. For instance, I would put £250,000 and they would contribute £100,000. I would be the only one living in the house and I wouldn’t pay any rent to them (as I said, they are nice friends). They already own their house. The thing we don’t understand is the stamp duty. The examples I found are for married or separated couples or friends living together. My understanding is that, with me being me a first-time buyer, I shouldn’t pay any stamp duty, but it is not clear how much they would pay.GB A If your friends just give you the £100,000 but don’t insist on being registered as joint owners with you at the Land Registry the stamp duty land tax (SDLT) position is pretty straightforward. As a sole first-time buyer you would qualify for 0% SDLT on the first £300,000 of the purchase price and – if the total is less than £500,000 – 5% on the amount over £300,000. So your SDLT bill would be £2,500. However, I am hoping for their sakes that your friends are nice but risk averse when it comes to investing money. It would be financial folly simply to hand over a large lump sum without having any security that they will get it back. The easiest way to get this would be for you and your friends to buy the house jointly as tenants in common so that you each own a distinct share in the property. The downside of this low-risk approach is that you wouldn’t get first-time buyer relief from SDLT because it’s only available if all joint purchasers are first-time buyers and your friends aren’t. And because your friends already own property, you would have to pay SDLT at the higher rates which are 3% on the first £125,000 of the consideration (purchase price), 5% on the next £125,000 then 8% on the remaining £100,000 of the proposed purchase price of £350,000. This would be a total bill of £18,000.  Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

4/25/2022,"In 2019, Ikea announced it had developed curtains that it claimed could “break down common indoor air pollutants”. The secret, it said, was the fabric’s special coating. “What if we could use textiles to clean the air?” asked Ikea’s product developer, Mauricio Affonso, in a promotional video for the “Gunrid” curtains. After explaining that the coating was a photocatalyst (“similar to photosynthesis, found in nature”), Affonso is shown gazing up at the gauzy curtains while uplifting music plays. “It’s amazing to work on something that can give people the opportunity to live a healthier life at home.”Puzzled by these claims – how could a mineral coating clean the air? – Avicenn, a French environmental nonprofit organisation, investigated. Independent laboratory tests of the Gunrid textile reported that samples contained tiny particles of titanium dioxide (TiO2) – a substance not normally toxic but which can be possibly carcinogenic if inhaled, and potentially in other forms – which supposedly gives “self-cleaning” properties to things such as paint and windows when exposed to sunlight. These tiny particles, or nanoparticles, are at the forefront of materials science. Nanoparticles come in all shapes – spheres, cubes, fibres or sheets – but the crucial thing is their size: they are smaller than 100 nanometres (a human hair is approximately 80,000nm thick). Many nanoparticles exist in nature. Nano-hairs make a gecko’s feet sticky, and nano-proteins make a spider’s silk strong. But they can be manufactured, and because they are so small, they have special properties that make them attractive across a range of endeavours – not just to companies such as Ikea. In medicine, they can transport cancer drugs directly into tumour cells, and nanosilver is used to coat medical breathing tubes and bandages. Nanos could direct pesticides to parts of a plant, or release nutrients from fertilisers in a more controlled manner. They also have more mundane uses. Synthetic nanos are added to cosmetics and food. Nanosilver is used in textiles, where it is claimed to give antibacterial properties to plasters, gym leggings, yoga mats and period pants. But scientists such as those at Avicenn are concerned that when these household items get washed, recycled or thrown away, synthetic nanos are released into the environment – making their way into the soil and sea in ways that are still not understood. Some scientists believe nanoparticles could pose an even greater threat than microplastics. Synthetic nano particles of plastic have been found in the ocean and in ice on both poles. Nanoparticles from socks and sunscreen have been found to pollute water, and certain nanos have been shown to negatively affect marine wildlife including fish and crustaceans. As with antibiotics, resistance to antimicrobial nanosilver can develop – silver-tolerant soil bacteria have now been found. Little is known even about where nanoparticles are, let alone their effects on the environment. As they are so tiny, most experiments are conducted in labs, and it can be hard to pin down where they are applied. “The main problem with these substances is that we cannot measure them – we know they are there but they’re so tiny they’re difficult to detect, which is why you don’t hear as much about them,” says Nick Voulvoulis, professor of environmental technology at Imperial College London. He worries about the uncontrolled use of nanos in consumer products. “If nanos are used properly in applications that are useful or beneficial, that’s justified, but if they are used anywhere and everywhere because they have certain properties, that’s crazy.” Synthetic nanoparticles are not inherently harmful. Like their natural cousins, many are metal-based, but they can be made of any substance. Crucially, unlike chemical compounds, they cannot be dissolved. Their tiny size gives them, paradoxically, an enormous surface area, which makes them behave differently to “non-nano” versions of the same material. It can make them more mobile, more reactive – and potentially more toxic, depending on shape, size, type, how a substance is released into the environment and its concentration. And released into the environment they are, on a massive scale. According to Avicenn, the release of nanos is most likely during manufacture or disposal, but it can also happen when items are washed – which is known to occur with fabrics containing nanosilver. Sewage systems cannot trap them and they end up in the ocean: the OECD says even advanced wastewater-treatment plants cannot deal with nanoparticles. From a health perspective, inhalation is the most harmful route of exposure to nanos such as TiO2 for factory workers and consumers. Avicenn’s tests concluded that the average particle size was 4.9nm, and all 300 particles analysed were below the official nano threshold of 100nm. Ikea insisted its own tests showed the TiO2 particles were “properly bound to the fabric” and “pose no risk” to customers, and said it took workers’ safety extremely seriously. The firm has not referred to them as nanoparticles, and said that once integrated into textile surfaces there was “no good standard method to measure the particle size distribution of a material”, acknowledging that EU definitions of nanomaterials were under review. “We recognise that the tests and measurements of nano-particles are complex, especially for materials containing particles that tend to form agglomerates,” it said. As for Ikea’s curtains shedding TiO2 nanoparticles when washed or discarded, Ikea said it was “confident that the treatment is properly bound to the fabric, and therefore we do not see a risk of inhaling the treatment”, but acknowledged that “as with any textile, parts of the textile can come off during use or washing”. Many nanos do not persist for long in the environment. However, because they are consistently being discharged, levels remain fairly constant. “Nanos are ‘pseudo-persistent’ because they degrade quite quickly but they keep entering the environment,” Voulvoulis says. His main concern is whether nanos become carriers for other compounds, a subject of scientific debate. In 2009, Spanish scientists suggested nanos could bind to and transport toxic pollutants, and possibly be toxic themselves by generating reactive free radicals. If other toxic pollutants “latch on” to nanos’ surfaces, they argued, marine plants and animals could absorb them more easily. Other scientists suggest the opposite: that organic matter in sewage coat nanoparticles, rendering them less active. And others fear nanos could trigger “toxic cocktail” effects – making them more harmful in combination than individual substances would be separately. So far, synthetic nanomaterials are relatively dispersed in the sea, and unlikely to significantly affect marine animals, says Dr Tobias Lammel of Gothenberg University, who has studied copper nanos. But he warns: “It’s possible that the concentration of some manufactured nanomaterials in the marine environment will increase … It is important to keep an eye on this.” Given the huge question marks, Avicenn wants more stringent regulations on nanos, and more caution in product design. “Companies are eager to sell innovative and fancy products, but they must thoroughly assess their benefits-risks balance at each step of the life-cycle of the products,” says Mathilde Detcheverry, Avicenn’s policy manager. From August, the EU will ban use of TiO2 nanos in food (where it is called E171) and the European Commission recently announced that 12 nanomaterials would soon be prohibited in cosmetics. Detcheverry says: “As scientific knowledge about the environmental and health impacts of engineered nanos such as silver and titanium dioxide advances, we need to make sure nanos are only allowed for specific and essential uses in order to minimise any adverse effects at the source and [ensure they are] not released uncontrollably.” Two years after the release of Ikea’s Gunrid curtains, Avicenn tried to buy more for further tests, but they had been withdrawn from sale. Ikea told the Guardian that Gunrid remained “safe to use as a traditional curtain” but it was withdrawn because “the functionality was not as effective as expected”. If that’s true – for example, that despite TiO2 having proven photocatalytic properties and being used in self-cleaning and air-purifying products, its efficacy on curtains could be localised and not powerful – then at the very least Ikea’s experience suggests nanoparticles’ benefits may not outweigh the potential and frequently unknown risks, Detcheverry says. “Nanoparticles are often promoted as silver bullets against pollution or bacteria,” she says, “but we must make sure that the cure is not worse than the disease.” Gunrid was just one product of many thousands that use nanoparticles. As Ikea’s Affonso says in the video: “What’s so great about Gunrid is that this technology could be applied to any textile.”",News/Environment,"Nano state: tiny and now everywhere, how big a problem are nanoparticles?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/nano-state-tiny-and-now-everywhere-how-big-a-problem-are-nanoparticles
4/25/2022,"Hello, and welcome to the new First Edition newsletter from the Guardian. I’m Archie Bland, the editor, and I’ll be writing to you at 7am on weekdays along with assistant editor Nimo Omer. We want this email to help make sense of the world you wake up to – with a wrap of the headlines, a pick of fantastic reads, and a deep dive on one essential subject. We’ll have lots more to say as we introduce you to the newsletter, and we’d love to hear what you think – just reply to this email. But today we’d better get on with it, because we’re starting with a big story: Emmanuel Macron has defeated the radical right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen to win a second term as president of France. For this first edition of First Edition, we’ll try to explain why Macron’s victory is important – but comes with serious caveats for anyone concerned about the rise of the radical right. First, here are the rest of the headlines. Ukraine | US secretary of state Antony Blinken said American diplomats would begin to return to Ukraine as he detailed a new package of military financing and ammunition sales worth $465m. Blinken and secretary of defence Lloyd Austin met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Sunday. Politics | Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has dismissed as “sexism and misogyny” a Mail on Sunday report claiming unnamed Tories believed she had adopted “Basic Instinct” tactics by crossing and uncrossing her legs to distract Boris Johnson in parliament. Health | The NHS is paying £2bn a year to private hospitals to cover a shortfall in beds for mental health patients, a Guardian investigation has found. Nine out of 10 mental health beds run by private operators are occupied by NHS patients. Social media | Twitter began negotiations with Tesla CEO Elon Musk after shareholders pushed the company to consider his $43bn takeover offer. Sources said that the company was not certain to accept his bid. Antarctica | Two crew members on a polar research ship are to become the first same-sex couple to get married in the British Antarctic Territory. Eric Bourne and Stephen Carpenter, who have been together 20 years, hope to be married by the boat’s captain today – weather allowing. In the end, Emmanuel Macron’s victory for his centrist party La République En Marche was comfortable: he took 58.5% of the vote against 41.5% for Marine Le Pen. (The latest results are here.) Turnout dropped, with abstentions at a record level of 28%, and his margin of victory has halved from 2017, when he beat Le Pen by 66% to 33%. He sought to frame his victory as one of national unity, saying: “I’m not the candidate of one camp any more, but the president of all of us.” Meanwhile, leftist groups protested on the streets about Le Pen’s score and Macron’s re-election alike. Considering that not long ago there were real fears of success for Le Pen’s attempt to cast herself and her far-right National Rally party as the true representatives of economically vulnerable voters, Macron’s win is a genuine achievement. “It is historic,” said the Guardian’s Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis. “It’s the first time in 20 years a French president has won a second term – voters here like to punish leaders at the ballot box.” And yet, Angelique said, “it was meant to be a foregone conclusion. He argued that he had successes in office, such as lowering unemployment and handling the economy during the pandemic, but it is certainly true that he came to power five years ago and told people, ‘I will make sure that nobody ever has a reason to vote for the extremes again’. And here we are. She has significantly increased her vote.” The result is “in the short-term really a relief”, Cas Mudde, a political scientist at the university of Georgia in the US and leading expert on populism and the radical right, told me last night. “But in the long-term, it is kicking the can down the road.” Here are some of the key reasons for optimism and pessimism for opponents of the far right this morning. Reasons to be cheerful 1. Macron won a decisive victory Heading into the crucial parliamentary elections that will dictate Macron’s ability to govern, “the big question becomes, will he be able to deliver a coherent majority through which he will be able to govern for the next five years,” Mujtaba Rahman, Europe director of the Eurasia Group consultancy, told First Edition assistant editor Nimo Omer last night. Rahman said Macron’s margin appears to be big enough “to give him and his allies a tremendous amount of momentum”. Of course, there will be many who think that Macron would be a better president with a serious influence from the left in parliament – and the radical left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose first-round supporters did their bit to keep Le Pen out and broke for Macron by a three to one margin, is urging voters to make him prime minister in June. But Rahman argues that Macron’s margin shows that “it’s wrong to suggest this is a presidency by default … there is a very large demographic of French voters that do proactively support him”. 2. The far right is divided While Le Pen has brought National Rally to a new high, and her far right rival Éric Zemmour won almost 2.5m votes in the first round, those successes may mask serious divisions. There is a contradiction between Le Pen’s successes in courting more mainstream voters with her focus on pocketbook issues and the more explicit nationalism of some of her allies. “There is tremendous competition on the far right,” said Rahman. “My suspicion is that that will ultimately mean they are less competitive than they could otherwise be.” 3. Le Pen is flawed – with no standout successor Zemmour noted last night that this is “the eighth time that defeat strikes the Le Pen name” – also referring to Marine’s father Jean-Marie. “Just objectively, she made an advance,” said Mudde. “But it looks as if the margin against her became bigger after the debate, and there will be those on her side who argue ‘we as a party are strong, but she’s not able to bring us beyond this point’ … I think as long as she is leader, the party will not be fully mainstreamed.” Reasons for concern 1. Le Pen’s ‘de-demonisation’ strategy One of the key planks of Le Pen’s approach was to talk less about her most extreme positions, on issues from immigration to banning Muslims from wearing headscarves in public – and to present herself instead as a friendly figure focused on the cost of living. It nearly worked. “Le Pen has given the far-right its highest ever vote in a presidential election,” said Angelique. The result is part of a gradual progression, not a one-off. “The fact she has risen over the mark of 40% shows she has managed to lower the nation’s fear of her.” One measure of that success: in September, a poll found her the 11th most popular political figure in France. A few weeks ago, she was second. (Edouard Philippe, former prime minister under Macron, was top.) 2. Younger voters are more open to the extreme right The most worrying feature of this election, said Mudde, is the age distribution of support: in the first round, “Macron appears to have survived because of older voters,” and data released by Ipsos on the run-off suggested that while 18-24 year olds did turn towards Macron, almost half of 25-49 year olds backed Le Pen. Some 71 per cent of over 70s backed Macron. This gets at a familiar story: across Europe, younger voters are turning away from a mainstream they believe has failed them, and reaching for “anti-system” parties of various stripes. “That is a reflection of the way economic reforms are being implemented at the expense of the younger,” Mudde said. “I am very, very sceptical Macron is going to change that.” 3. The old parties have collapsed – and Macron is a one-man band For Mudde, the big problem with the way we tend to think about elections with far-right candidates is exactly that framing – a “disproportionate fascination”. “It focuses on the minority, not the majority,” he said. “The more important story is what is happening at the heart of liberal democracy.” The traditional parties of left and right have collapsed from 56% of votes in the first round in 2012 to just 6% this year. “It is a stunning death on the national stage,” said Angelique. “Locally and regionally they’re still strong – but it creates a dangerous situation about what comes next.” Macron’s party La République En Marche, meanwhile, “is a machine built around one man, set up for him with his initials, EM. There’s no obvious person to take over… Literally the minute he wins, the battle begins in this devastated political landscape to try to find out who or what will come in five years’ time.” Mudde agrees. “The traditional parties have been replaced not by a party, but by a man – a man who cannot run again. That is where the real story is.” “I think France has bought itself five more years,” he said. “Calling it a hollow victory would be too harsh. It is very important. But it comes with significant red flags.” Read more on the French election This piece by Angelique explains the contrast between Macron’s economic successes and the voters who feel their lives are getting worse. Jon Henley sets out the key issues facing Macron in his second term, from the war in Ukraine to his limited personal support. Kim Willsher looks at the prospects of civil war on the radical right if Le Pen steps back. Last week, Owen Jones argued that only politicians who recognise that we live in “an age of grievance and fury driven by stagnating living conditions and justifiable pessimism” will be able to finally see off the likes of Le Pen. After the debate, French political scientist Philippe Marlière wrote that Macron helped Le Pen’s “de-demonisation” strategy by focusing on policy details in the debate instead of emphasising her far-right status.

4/25/2022,"In the long, narrow basement underneath Litsey 20, a school in Ivano-Frankivsk, western Ukraine, Serhiy Korneliyevych Hamchuk stands before a row of women and lays a Kalashnikov assault rifle down on the desk in front of him. The 10 women, aged between 18 and 51, watch attentively as Hamchuk demonstrates how to load ammunition into the gun’s magazine, sliding the bullets into place one after another with his thumb. “Dobre,” he says. “Good. Who wants to try?” The concrete walls of Litsey 20, one of the largest schools in Ivano-Frankivsk, are normally filled with the chatter of more than 1,200 students aged between six and 18. But with in-person teaching banned across Ukraine because of the war, the school is providing a different sort of education. At the end of March, the mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk, one of the largest cities in western Ukraine, announced that shooting ranges at five schools in the city – normally used by pupils in the Ukrainian equivalent of the Combined Cadet Force – would be reopened in order to teach civilians how to use firearms. Although open to all, the courses are primarily aimed at women. “There are other institutions where men can train, but these are special courses organised for women,” Ruslan Martsinkiv, the city’s mayor, says. “Women have to be ready to protect themselves and their families.” The first lesson was held on 31 March, the day Ukrainian forces liberated Bucha, a suburb north-west of the capital, Kyiv. In the days that followed, as reports of war crimes committed by Russian soldiers circulated in the media and on Telegram channels – of the killing of civilians with their hands tied behind their backs, of rape, torture and looting – thousands of women rushed to sign up. Over the first weekend, more than 3,700 women enrolled, with 800 men also registering their interest. In the weeks since, thousands more have signed up, and there is now a waitlist of more than 6,300 women who want to learn how to shoot. For 51-year-old Natalia Anoshina, the idea that she might want to know how to handle a rifle was one she had never considered. But after hearing about the atrocities in Bucha, when her 18-year-old daughter suggested they sign up, she agreed. “It’s a nightmare, it’s just horrific. My mind can’t process this information, this dread,” she says of the events outside Kyiv. Dressed in a grey hoodie, jeans and purple Crocs, Natalia watches while her daughter, Anya, lies propped up on her elbows on the shooting range, and cocks the air rifle tucked into her shoulder to load it with a pellet. “It makes you look at things with a different perspective,” she says. “These are the things that lead you to some unexpected decisions. Now, anything could help you, like this shooting course.” Hamchuk, a former colonel in the Ukrainian army, is more forthright. “Taking into consideration what is happening around Kyiv, I think everyone should hold a gun and defend our country,” he says, disassembling the Kalashnikov with a clatter. The shooting lessons, available every weekday in Litsey 20 and the four other schools in the city, are split into two parts: the basics of handling a Kalashnikov, and target practice on the shooting range with an air rifle. Those attending are not issued with guns afterwards, but, Martsinkiv says, “the main point is to learn how to use it, so they are ready to use it”, if and when the time comes. “There is no fighting in Ivano-Frankivsk at the moment, but if war comes here it will be a different situation – we’ve seen what happened in Bucha and Irpin,” Martsinkiv adds. “Women need to be ready, it’s the task of the present day, the task of war.” As they take it in turns to shoot a cup off a chair, the women chat and laugh. But they become sombre when they discuss what motivated them to attend. Galina, a plumbing saleswoman from Ivano-Frankivsk, signed up for the sessions as soon as they were announced because she thinks that knowing how to handle a weapon is a useful skill in wartime. The events in Bucha, she says, were a painful confirmation that she had made the right decision. “You need to know these skills and have the possibility to defend yourself in the future. I have a son and a husband who are in the army. But I need it for myself, in case of an emergency,” she says. “It would be better if I don’t ever need to, but at least I will know how to use it. What else can we do? It’s just the state of life now.” Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:",News/Global development,‘Women need to be ready’: the Ukrainian city where mums and daughters are learning to shoot,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/25/women-need-to-be-ready-the-ukrainian-city-where-mums-and-daughters-are-learning-to-shoot
