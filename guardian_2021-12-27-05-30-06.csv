12/27/2021,"Labour has claimed ministers are risking the emergence of other Covid variants like Omicron by thwarting a bid by poorer countries to manufacture their own vaccines. The British government has “actively blocked countries in Africa and across the developing world from making their own vaccines” by opposing a waiver on intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines, the party says.  Rich countries are divided over the proposal for a temporary waiver, first floated last year by India and South Africa. While the US, Australia and New Zealand have backed the idea, the UK, European Union and Switzerland are opposed. Gareth Thomas, the shadow trade minister, has written to Penny Mordaunt accusing Boris Johnson’s administration of helping to prevent a move that would increase vaccination in deprived nations and reduce the risk of further mutations. “I’m writing to ask why the government is continuing to block solutions to the Covid pandemic, given the severity of the crisis affecting the NHS and the economy caused by rapidly escalating levels of Omicron cases?”, he wrote to Mordaunt, the trade policy minister. “The people of our country will not be safe from new variants of Covid until global solutions are in place, levels of vaccination worldwide are significantly higher and levels of infections across the developing world are lower. An [intellectual property rights] waiver is important to achieving this.” More than 100 countries, Pope Francis, UN experts, global civil society organisations such as Medecins Sans Frontières and human rights lawyers have backed India and South Africa’s plea for a temporary waiver from key elements of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) Agreement, which helps pharmaceutical companies to exploit new drugs they produce. Negotiations, overseen by the World Trade Organization (WTO), have made little progress. Earlier this month the government reiterated its opposition to the plan. It told the Trips council that it was one of the countries that are “convinced … that a Trips waiver proposal would not increase the number of vaccines reaching peoples arms” and, if implemented, would pose “risks … for this and future pandemics” by stifling pharmaceutical innovation. A UK government spokesperson confirmed that it did not support a waiver. “The UK has engaged in discussions on intellectual property (IP) and a possible Trips waiver at the WTO, and we will continue to do so constructively. A fit for purpose IP system has been crucial in supporting the rapid development of new vaccines, and a waiver would risk undermining the framework’s ability to do this and could disincentivise future research and development investment,” they said. “The UK has been a world leader in ensuring developing countries can access vaccines through our investment in Oxford/AstraZeneca, early support to the Covax scheme [to provide vaccines to poorer countries] and commitment to donating vaccines,” they added.",News/UK news,Labour claims UK ministers risking emergence of new Covid variants,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/26/labour-claims-uk-ministers-risking-emergence-of-new-covid-variants
12/27/2021,"One in four Britons do not believe that the NHS can care for them properly, new research into the public’s attitude to the health service reveals. When asked “how confident are you, if at all, in the NHS’s ability to give you the care you need?”, a quarter (26%) said they were not confident.  While only 15% thought the NHS was not coping well with treating coronavirus patients, many more – 41% – believed that it was not coping well with providing other services. Experts said that increasingly long delays for operations and GP appointments, Covid’s disruption to normal NHS services and longstanding staff shortages were likely to blame for the widespread lack of confidence in the health service’s ability to provide timely and effective medical treatment. Sally Warren, the director of policy at the King’s Fund health thinktank, said that the pandemic had added to the pressure already being felt in the NHS and forced it to prioritise who received care. “The impact of this reprioritisation has been clear for all to see through regular reports of NHS services struggling to cope. Once again this is at the forefront of many people’s minds as the Omicron variant brings back the threat of services being overwhelmed,” said Warren. “But it’s not just media reports that change people’s perceptions of the health service, and many people have personal experience of struggling to access their GP or being stuck on a hospital waiting list,” she added. The findings by the pollsters Ipsos Mori are based on questions it asked 1,032 adults aged 18 to 75 across Britain between 16 and 18 December. When the 41% who thought the NHS was not coping well with providing non-Covid care were asked who they held responsible, 48% said the government, 18% blamed patients and 8% identified the general public as the culprits. The survey also found that people who were on a waiting list for routine hospital care themselves or who have had a relative on one were more likely to be “not confident” in the NHS’s ability to provide care. Labour said the findings showed the effects of persistent and unaddressed staff shortages. “The pandemic has put enormous pressures on the NHS. But the health service went into the pandemic hugely understaffed with patients already waiting too long for care. With record waiting lists, 100,000 NHS staff shortages and 112,000 vacancies in social care in 2019, the Tories left our health service criminally ill-equipped for Covid,” said Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary. “None of this is the fault of our heroic health and social care workers, who are getting Britain through this pandemic. For our NHS to be able to provide the care patients expect the workforce needs to be properly valued, strengthened and provided with modern equipment and technology to ensure patients receive quality care quicker,” he added. The pandemic – which led to the widespread suspension of normal NHS care and has seen England’s waiting list soar from 4.4 million to 5.8 million – appears to have undermined the public’s faith in its ability to give them the care they need. In the research, 37% of those questioned said they had less confidence that the NHS could give them the care they need since the pandemic while just 21% said they had more confidence. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals in England, said the huge pressures the service was under were being felt by patients. “The NHS has just been through the toughest two years in its history, and is being severely tested on multiple fronts. “The public know the health service is pulling out all the stops to provide the care people need. A large majority are confident in the NHS’s ability to deliver that care. It’s understandable, given the scale of the pressures, that some will be worried,” Hopson said. He cited the Omicron variant, the record backlog of those waiting for surgery – which NHS leaders admit will take years to clear – and huge demand for A&E as examples of the growing strain. Kate Duxbury, Ipsos Mori’s joint research director, said: “Overall, the public still think the NHS has the ability to give them the care they need, though this has been impacted by the pandemic and there are signs it will come under increasing pressure as more people find themselves waiting for NHS care.” A Department of Health and Social care spokesperson declined to respond directly to the findings. But a spokesperson said: “While the pandemic has put enormous pressures on the NHS and caused waiting lists to grow, the NHS is delivering the biggest vaccination rollout in history and more than 32 million people have been given their vital booster jab. “Our record investment in the NHS includes an extra £2bn this year and £8bn over the next three years to cut waiting times and deliver an extra 9m checks, scans and operations ensuring patients get the treatment they need sooner. “The NHS is also deploying more efficient, innovative ways of working, including opening new surgical hubs and at least 100 community diagnostic centres by 2025 to make getting checked quicker and more convenient.”",News/Society,"One in four Britons ‘not confident NHS can care for them’, survey reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/26/one-in-four-briton-not-confident-nhs-can-care-for-them-survey-reveals
12/27/2021,"This was some way for Romelu Lukaku to reintroduce himself. He returned to from an ankle injury in style, coolly heading in before running half the pitch to earn a stoppage-time penalty at Aston Villa to help Chelsea earned a much-needed victory. Thomas Tuchel certainly tested the give in the turf here – bouncing up and down in frustration as Chelsea trailed to a first-half own goal by Reece James – but by close of play he could count himself happy, a first league win in three matches ensuring his side move level with Liverpool, who have a game in hand, and can still spy leaders Manchester City on an afternoon when those below them in the table gathered speed.  In the absence of Steven Gerrard, who had to watch from home after testing positive for coronavirus, it was down to his assistants, Gary McAllister and Michael Beale, to conduct Villa’s rhythm. Villa did not lack any early momentum, Ollie Watkins harrying and cutting out James’s pass within a matter of seconds and Tuchel was soon contorting on the touchline as Christian Pulisic – whose manager had warned he was “fighting for confidence” in the No 9 role he again started in – laboured to press the impressive Douglas Luiz. Villa were lively, Chelsea very much second best. Thiago Silva had to stay alert to prevent Watkins squaring for Danny Ings at the back post and then Ings had a shot blocked by Silva after Matty Cash juggled the ball forward from halfway. Tuchel, hands clasped together, looked a little concerned. Douglas Luiz angled an exquisite half-volleyed pass over the Chelsea defence for Watkins to gallop on to, only for Trevor Chalobah to make a smart block. Mason Mount did rattle the crossbar, his overcooked right-footed cross from the left prompting Emiliano Martínez to hastily backpedal but Villa deservedly took the lead as the half-hour mark approached, albeit via a player in luminous yellow. Matt Targett sent in a flat, first-time cross from the left and James inadvertently glanced the ball on and it whistled over the unsuspecting Édouard Mendy, who no doubt had flashbacks to West Ham’s winner earlier this month. Chelsea were disjointed and unconvincing going forward, but then Cash dangled a lifeline. The Villa full-back was caught the wrong side of Callum Hudson-Odoi and crudely clipped at his heels. Cash knew he had no grounds for complaint and Jorginho nonchalantly sent Martínez the wrong way from the penalty spot. Villa fashioned a couple more openings before the interval – Ings dallied after latching on to a cute outside-of-the-boot pass by the relentless Watkins, moments later Chalobah denied the striker a clean shot at goal – but they were overpowered following Lukaku’s half-time introduction. Lukaku provided Chelsea a welcome focal point and hauled Chelsea into the lead within 11 minutes of entering. Villa did not heed the warning signs. Mount sent in a cross from the right, which eluded the forehead of the lurking Lukaku by a matter of millimetres, but soon after Chelsea activated a different line of attack. Hudson-Odoi, out on the left flank, cut on to his right foot and curled an inviting cross into the box. Lukaku was unperturbed by Tyrone Mings’s feeble attempts to make life difficult and glanced a header into the far corner. Tuchel calmly clenched his fist and Lukaku wheeled away in celebration. For all of Villa’s early gusto, they seemed to run out of steam. Even Watkins had fallen a little bit flat. The midfielder Morgan Sanson, making his first start since April, was replaced by Anwar El Ghazi with 15 minutes to play, by which point Bertrand Traoré and Carney Chukwuemeka had already been welcomed on to the field. Mount missed a wonderful chance to extend Chelsea’s advantage, screwing wide with the goal gaping after taking the ball past Martínez, but Jorginho swelled the scoreline in stoppage time.",Sport/Football,Romelu Lukaku’s late arrival powers Chelsea to victory over Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/aston-villa-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
12/27/2021,"Tony Williams, an old school friend of mine, who has died aged 80 after complications from Alzheimer’s disease, was a record producer, the founder of Spotlite Records and a pioneer of the appreciation of early modern jazz. Born in Enfield, north London, he was the younger son of Pip (nee Fortuna) and Ronald Williams, a teacher. Tony attended Glendale grammar school in Wood Green. He left in his mid-teens, after becoming inspired by recordings of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, and the pursuit of bebop and modern jazz became a consuming passion. He fuelled this passion working at HMV and with kindred spirits at Dobell’s record shop in Charing Cross Road. This led to a discography of Charlie Parker that established Tony as an authority on the man and his music.  In the pre-internet world of the 1950s, it would not have been easy to research the somewhat esoteric world of bebop, and it is a tribute to Tony that he did. I was impressed when I heard he had played chess with Gillespie in 1961, backstage at the Gaumont State theatre in Kilburn. In 1963 I joined Tony to meet Ben Webster at the Tally Ho pub in Kentish Town, when Webster was in London with a touring band. It was evident that Tony was at home in this rarefied world. At this time, he was living with his French wife Francine (nee Mouleux), whom he married in 1963, and their young son, Laurence, in Winchmore Hill, later moving to Harlow, Essex. Tony established a rapport with Ross Russell in California, the record producer who founded Dial Records in the 40s, under which label Parker had made some of his most important recordings. Russell offered him the rights to the Dial originals, which had almost fallen into obscurity. This was the impetus for Tony to create Spotlite Records. The name came from a New York club associated with Parker. Interest in bebop was at a low point then and this friendship with Tony encouraged Russell to complete his definitive biography of Parker, Bird Lives. When Clint Eastwood made his film Bird, his studio contacted Tony for guidance on Parker’s music. Spotlite’s launch in 1968 was based on the “Charlie Parker on Dial” recordings. After the success of the Parker reissues, Tony set out to France to find Parker’s widow, Chan, in order to give her some of the proceeds. The 70s and 80s were good years for Spotlite, with a growing catalogue of CDs and cassettes as well as LPs. Tony’s networking led to some remarkable musicians enjoying hospitality at his and Francine’s Harlow home, including Joe Albany, Cecil Payne, Al Haig, JR Monterose and Red Rodney. Tony also built on numerous other friendships, and recording sessions took place with leading British musicians including Don Rendell, Pete King, Brian Dee, Elaine Delmar and many others. After his marriage ended in divorce, Tony met Stephanie Coward, with whom he had a son, Gabriel. Stephanie died in 2019. Tony is survived by Laurence and Gabriel.",Arts/Music,Tony Williams obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/26/tony-williams-obituary
12/27/2021,"There is something about this time of year that demands a good, solid adaptation of a literary classic. Right on cue, here is Around the World in 80 Days (BBC One) for the entire family to enjoy. After the past two years, the prospect of watching adventurers gallivant all over the planet, on a whim, seems almost too cruel to contemplate. No pricey PCR tests, no threat of a country ending up on the red list at the last minute, no prospect of cancellation due to circumstances beyond anyone’s control? Those global circumnavigators didn’t know how good they had it in 1872.  That should mean there is more pleasure in quite literally watching the world go by, even if it takes a while to get going. After hearing of a new railway while dining at his private members’ club, Phileas Fogg (David Tennant, with moustache) accepts a bet that he can be the first man to travel around the globe in 80 days. Off he goes, gathering up companions as if this is a 19th-century Doctor Who and getting himself into historical scrapes. Tennant promised a “romp” from this updated version of Jules Verne’s novel, and it certainly is lively. This is big television in the vein of His Dark Materials (and its gorgeous opening credits seem to have taken some inspiration from that series, as well as from Game of Thrones). The prolific composer Hans Zimmer has written the score, alongside Christian Lundberg. Naturally, given its source material, it zips around the planet. This is a multinational production, showing off its many locations, and a second season has been confirmed before the first has even aired. Clearly, there is great confidence in it. It is justified, largely. Fogg is a dour, troubled rich man, ambling around in the trappings of his vast and mysterious wealth. He sulks in his mansion, he sulks in his club. He has a touch of the Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos about him; the spectre of a wealthy man who needs a frivolous and history-making journey to feel alive again is familiar. His ardour for the “balloon contraption” is his equivalent of the modern enthusiasm for the space rocket. In the book, Fogg is fastidious and precise, but Tennant’s Fogg is more of a clumsy blunderer, at least to start with. Here, the charisma is shared among the three main characters, rather than hogged by Tennant alone. Detective Fix, Verne’s Scotland Yard policeman, has morphed into Abigail “Fix” Fortescue, a plucky gal reporter with a weekly column to fill and an unwilling subject – Fogg – about whom she has to write. The Crown’s Leonie Benesch (she played Prince Philip’s sister) portrays her with guts and gumption, as a woman trying to break into a man’s world and make a name for herself against the odds. And why not? The book remains as it ever was, even if purists may grumble, and the character doesn’t seem crowbarred in. The fact that she is a likable journalist may require more of an imaginative leap for some, however. Completing the trio is Ibrahim Koma as Fogg’s valet, Passepartout, whose story shares near-equal billing with Fogg’s in the first episode, via the addition of an emotional fraternal reunion and a revolutionary subplot. Koma brings a lot of charm to his Passepartout, despite setting him up as a bit of a romantic cad. Although they have not had a lot of time to establish themselves as a three-piece quite yet, it looks as if they will not have any trouble carrying the show together. Around the World in 80 Days does suffer from a touch of first-episode syndrome, though. It has to set the scene and build its world – and it takes its time to do so. It isn’t until the white cliffs of Dover begin to recede behind Fogg, Passepartout and Miss Fix that it starts to feel as if it is going somewhere worth your time and investment. By the halfway point, I was keen for the travelling to start and the adventures to begin; British television is not lacking in period dramas about posh people, so the least they could do is chuck in a bit of pleasant scenery and swashbuckling, to hurry along the wagers made in private members’ clubs over boiled beef and spotted dick. However, as I say, this is big television, an eight-part series, and it has plenty of time to unfurl and reveal its charms. I am looking forward to seeing where they go next, in every sense.",Arts/Television & radio, Around the World in 80 Days review – David Tennant channels a Victorian Jeff Bezos,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/26/around-the-world-in-80-days-review-david-tennant-channels-a-victorian-jeff-bezos
