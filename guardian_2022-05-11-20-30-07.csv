5/11/2022,"Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east, amid warnings from a senior US military official that neither side can win in the present circumstances. Despite claims from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counteroffensives around Kharkiv and elsewhere were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. “The Russians aren’t winning, and the Ukrainians aren’t winning, and we’re at a bit of a stalemate here,” said Lt Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, who gave evidence of Tuesday alongside Avril Haines, the US national intelligence director, to the Senate armed forces committee. The warning was delivered as the Russian military claimed its forces had advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging to securing control of the Donbas region. Tetiana Apatchenko, a spokesperson for the 92nd Separate Mechanised Brigade, the main Ukrainian force in the area, confirmed that Ukrainian troops had in recent days recaptured the settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske, in a pocket north of Kharkiv. President Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Tuesday that he had “good news” from Kharkiv. “The occupiers are gradually being pushed away,” he said. “I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders.” The tenuous nature of the advances, however, was highlighted by the head of the Kharkiv regional state administration, Oleg Synegubov, who conceded that while the four villages had been retaken fierce battles were still raging. Russia and Ukraine have made inflated claims regarding their successes with assessments emerging in recent weeks from western defence and intelligence officials often painting a more subdued picture. On Wednesday, the latest update from the UK’s Ministry of Defence pinpointed the continuing struggle for Zmiinyi Island as increasingly crucial for Russian efforts to dominate the Black Sea. The MoD said: “Fighting continues at Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, with Russia repeatedly trying to reinforce its exposed garrison located there. “Ukraine has successfully struck Russian air defences and resupply vessels with Bayraktar drones. Russia’s resupply vessels have minimum protection in the western Black Sea, following the Russian navy’s retreat to Crimea after the loss of the Moskva. “Russia’s current efforts to augment its forces on Zmiinyi Island offer Ukraine more opportunities to engage Russian troops and attrit materiel. “If Russia consolidates its position on Zmiinyi Island with strategic air defence and coastal defence cruise missiles, they could dominate the north-western Black Sea.” Recent aerial images from the island following Ukrainian drone attacks showed columns of smoke from Russian positions. A Russian landing craft hit close to the island over the weekend appeared to have been involved in efforts to reinforce Russian troops there. Graphically underlining the grim nature of the fighting, the press service of the Azov brigade – a Ukrainian unit that has historical far-right affiliations – which is trapped by Russian forces inside the Azovstal steel mill in Mauripol released images of wounded soldiers, many missing limbs and being cared for in unsanitary conditions. Warnings of a “prolonged war” not least from Avril Haines in her testimony to Senate members, has come amid a mounting recognition in western capitals that both Moscow and Kyiv are increasingly bound by more maximalist war aims, making a negotiated end to the fighting complicated. With many analysts viewing any backdown by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over the refocused Russian campaign in the south and east of the country as political suicide, Kyiv appeared to be insisting that its war aims now included regaining territory lost during 2014. In an interview with the Financial Times, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine initially believed victory would be the withdrawal of Russian troops to positions they occupied before the invasion. “Now if we are strong enough on the military front, and we win the battle for Donbas, which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war, of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories.”",News/World news,"Russian invasion in eastern Ukraine heading for stalemate, says US official",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-forces-pushing-back-russia-troops-in-kharkiv

5/11/2022,"Arsenal have held talks over a summer move for Gabriel Jesus and the Manchester City forward is giving serious consideration to the transfer, his agent has said. Jesus has another year on his contract at City but refused last month to commit his future to the club and Marcelo Pettinati spoke on Wednesday about his client’s future. “We had talks with Arsenal about Gabriel Jesus,” the agent said. “We like the project – it’s a possibility we’re discussing. There are six more clubs interested in Gabriel. He’s focused on the final games with Man City; we’ll see.” Jesus has been with City since 2017 and a move to Arsenal could suit both parties. The forwards Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah are out of contract at the Emirates this summer and there is a strong chance both will leave, although the club are particularly keen to extend Nketiah’s deal. Jesus has started 19 of City’s Premier League games this season, scoring eight times, and started both legs of their Champions League semi-final defeat by Real Madrid, having been used sparingly in the tournament before then. He scored four times against Watford last month and was asked after whether he would like to start more regularly. “It’s not just me, it’s [all] the players,” he said.",Sport/Football,"Gabriel Jesus wanted by Arsenal and likes the project, forward’s agent says",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/gabriel-jesus-wanted-by-arsenal-and-likes-the-project-agent-says
5/11/2022,"In its Derbyshire homeland, they maintain that this gloriously nutty, sticky confection is a pudding. In truth – and as has been noted by others – it’s a tart whether you fill it with the traditional baked custard or with the almond paste that has become more familiar due to the efforts of a certain Mr Kipling. Whatever you call it, it’s irresistible. Prep 15 minChill 30 min+Cook 1 hr 30 minMakes 1 x 23cm tart For the pastry140g plain flour, plus extra to sprinkleA pinch of salt85g cold butter, plus extra to greaseCold water For the frangipane110g butter110g caster sugar2 eggs, beaten110g ground almonds25g plain flour½ tsp baking powderZest of ½ lemon25g flaked almonds, to top For the compote (or use 100g low-sugar raspberry jam)250g raspberries (fresh or frozen)25-35g caster sugar, depending on sweetness of toothJuice of ½ lemon Puff pastry, which these days is more often used with the custard filling, appears in most older recipes, but I think a sturdy shortcrust works better, especially with the denser frangipane in my version. You could buy it, but it’s not hard to make yourself and the results are much nicer. If using shop-bought, start at step 3. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl, then grate in the cold butter. Rub this in with your fingertips until the flour looks like damp sand, then very gradually stir in just enough cold water to bring everything together into a coherent, but not sticky dough. (Alternatively, use a food processor, but be careful not to overwork the mix.) Wrap the dough in a clean tea towel or greaseproof paper, so it doesn’t dry out, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, grease an approximately 23cm tart tin (it’s always better to go for something slightly too small than too large) and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it’s large enough to line the tin. Carefully lift it in, then top with baking paper and weigh this down with baking beans, dried pulses, rice or whatever you use in such situations, making sure they come right up the sides. Trim off any excess, then bake for about 15 minutes, until golden. Meanwhile, make the compote, if using. Put the berries in a small pan with the sugar and lemon juice, and bring to a boil over a medium heat. Turn down the heat slightly and leave to simmer for about 12 minutes, and making sure it doesn’t catch, until the mix has thickened to a loose, jam-like consistency. Take off the heat and leave to cool slightly. Once the base is golden, carefully remove the baking beans and paper, remembering that they will be hot, and put the tart case back into the oven for another couple of minutes, until it feels dry and biscuity in the middle, and taking care not to let the sides burn. Set aside to cool while you make the frangipane; if you plan on baking the tart immediately, leave the oven on. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl or food mixer, and beat until well mixed and fluffy. Beat in the eggs a little at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl between each addition, so nothing gets left behind. Gently fold in the almonds, flour, baking powder, lemon zest and a pinch of salt. Spread the compote or jam over the base of the tart and spoon the frangipane on top, being careful not to knock any more air out of it than you have to, especially when you level out the surface. Bake for about 25 minutes, until golden and well risen; scatter over the flaked almonds for the last five minutes of baking time. Remove and leave to cool slightly, or completely, before slicing and serving. I don’t think this tart needs icing – it’s sweet enough already – but if you must, mix 300g icing sugar with just enough cold water to make a thickish paste (about three tablespoons should do it). Spread this on top of the cooled tart and leave to set. If you go down this route, I’d scatter on the flaked almonds afterwards, rather than in step 8, though Mr Kipling fans may wish to substitute glacé cherries.

5/11/2022,"What if you never had to type in a password again? Imagine. An international day of celebration. Children dancing in the streets. Soldiers laying down their arms and hugging tearfully across the battlefield. Or, at least, a mild improvement in your daily life. That’s what Apple, Google and Microsoft are offering, with a fairly rare triple announcement that the three tech giants are all adopting the Fido standard and ushering in a passwordless future. The standard replaces usernames and passwords with ‘passkeys’, log-in information stored directly on your device and only uploaded to the website when matched with biometric authentication like a selfie or fingerprint. From Apple’s announcement: Users will sign in through the same action that they take multiple times each day to unlock their devices, such as a simple verification of their fingerprint or face, or a device PIN. This new approach protects against phishing and sign-in will be radically more secure when compared to passwords and legacy multi-factor technologies such as one-time passcodes sent over SMS. The three companies will roll out Fido support “over the course of the coming year”. The Fido2 standard is actually already public, and some companies support it already, largely for internal authentication. But the standard has long lacked the final step necessary for ubiquity: making it easy to get started. That’s what this latest announcement is about. With the help of the platform owners, users will be able to sync their Fido “passkeys”, without needing to log in fresh on each new device. That takes it from a service that is nice addition to passwords, to one that can be fully used to replace them. Ease of use is only part of the reason for the switch. Passkeys, secured with biometric identification on your phone, are faster than manually entering passwords, but if you use a password manager (and you should use a password manager) you’ll be able to enter passwords and login to most websites at the tap of a (fingerprint sensing) button anyway. But the bigger reason is that passwords suck. They suck because of how they are used in practice: people make short, easy-to-guess passwords, and then re-use them across the internet. For many users, the more important a website is, the more likely the password is to be short and easy-to-guess, because while you may tolerate entering a long, secure password once or twice, you won’t bother doing it several times a day. And the ways we’ve tried to fix passwords … also suck. Requirements to add complexity to passwords, in an attempt to make it harder to break them by brute force, are notoriously infuriating, and frequently inept at securing the actual outcome they’re seeking: if “P@ssword1” is a valid password but “doubloon prorogue tunnel” (to offer a passphrase randomly generated by my password manager just now) isn’t, you’ve just reduced the security of someone’s account. Two-factor authentication, which asks you to link a second “factor” to your account – such as a phone number which gets texted, or another device, which you use to approve the login – has its own problems. The most popular forms of two-factor authentication all involve the use of one-time passcodes, either texted to you or generated by an app on your phone or computer. And those one-time passcodes are just as open to phishing as a conventional password, albeit with a shorter expiration date if they’re successfully stolen. And so, if the Fido thing takes off, the world should get slightly more secure, slightly less frustrating and slightly smoother to move through. What will it look like for you? Probably not that different in practice. One day, you’ll be making an account on a website and just … won’t be asked for a password. You might not even notice it happens. But rest assured: the children will be dancing in the streets anyway.

5/11/2022,"Bob Dylan’s largest-ever sculpture, of a railway freight carriage, has been unveiled on a French vineyard. The monumental piece, entitled Rail Car, is built from about seven tonnes of iron and installed on train tracks at Château La Coste in Provence. Exposed to the elements, it features motifs of ladders, wheels and tools. Dylan said the artwork “represents perception and reality at the same time … all the iron is recontextualised to represent peace, serenity and stillness.” He heralded the work’s “enormous energy … It represents the illusions of a journey rather than the contemplation of one.” Rail Car continues Dylan’s sculptural artworks in welded metal that were first shown publicly in 2013, with a set of iron gates entitled Mood Swings that were exhibited at London’s Halcyon Gallery. Other metal works include Portal, an iron archway created for a casino in Maryland. Another gate piece was bought for $84,375 by the US state department in 2019, to install in its embassy in Mozambique – the high expenditure was criticised, with an official at the department describing the purchase as “excessive”. Railways are a repeated feature of Dylan’s painting, and he wrote about them in his memoir, Chronicles: Volume One: “I’d seen and heard trains from my earliest childhood days and the sight and sound of them always made me feel secure. The big boxcars, the iron ore cars, freight cars, passenger trains, Pullman cars. There was no place you could go in my home town without at least some part of the day having to stop at intersections and wait for the long trains to pass.” Iron, too, has a link with Dylan’s past. “I’ve been around iron all my life, ever since I was a kid,” he said in 2013. “I was born and raised in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day.” Railway imagery appears in songs such as 1979’s Slow Train, as a symbol for impending change and judgment, and 1962’s Train A-Travelin’: “There’s an iron train a-travelin’ / that’s been a-rollin’ through the years / With a firebox of hatred and a furnace full of fears / If you ever heard its sound or seen its blood-red broken frame / Then you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my name.” Rail Car joins another high-profile project away from music for the 80-year-old songwriter this year: in November he will publish The Philosophy of Modern Song, a 60-strong essay collection celebrating songs by musicians including Elvis Costello, Hank Williams and Nina Simone. Dylan is awaiting progress with a lawsuit filed against him by a woman who accuses him of sexually abusing her when she was 12 years old, in 1965. In January, Dylan’s lawyers vigorously rejected her claims, calling the lawsuit “a brazen shakedown … false, malicious, reckless and defamatory”. He also sold his catalogue of recordings to Sony Music Entertainment earlier this year, in a deal believed to be worth as much as $200m. He had previously sold his songwriting rights to Universal in 2020, for a rumoured $400m.",Arts/Music,"Bob Dylan unveils his largest-ever sculpture, of a railway freight car",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/11/bob-dylan-unveils-his-largest-ever-sculpture-of-a-railway-freight-car
5/11/2022,"ITV has warned that it expects an advertising slump over the coming months because of “macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty” and the absence of a major commercial event such as last year’s European football championship. The broadcaster lauded a “robust” start to the year, having grown TV and digital advertising revenues by a healthy 16% year-on-year to £468m in the first three months. It remains on track to launch its free, ad-funded service ITVX – its new streaming master brand that will replace the ITV Hub and paid-for ITV Hub+ brands and also draw on content from BritBox – in the final quarter. ITV reiterated that the streaming service would help it achieve a goal of £750m in digital ad income annually by 2026, reducing its dependence on traditional TV advertising. The broadcaster grew total external revenues – including income from its in-house ITV Studios operation, which makes shows including Coronation Street, Hell’s Kitchen and Love Island – by 18% to £834m for the first quarter. However, the company said it narrowly missed its forecast of 10% total advertising growth for April, hitting 9% instead. May is expected to be down 8% year-on-year, with June off 15%, with the second quarter overall dropping 6% year-on-year. ITV slightly beat the consensus forecast from analysts of an 8% ad slump in the second quarter. The broadcaster said the strong start to the year means that overall ad revenue in the first half will be up 5% year- on-year, and 7% compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. “As expected, advertising comparatives get much tougher in the second quarter and third quarter against the Euro football championships in 2021 and we are mindful of the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty,” the company said. ITV’s share price, which is down more than 40% over the past year, crept up 1% after the release of the trading update. The broadcaster said its total streaming hours dropped 7%, or 20m hours, to 247m in the first quarter. It added that while streaming on its platforms grew 8% in the quarter, total streaming had been affected by a decision to make fewer of its shows available on other platforms. “ITV has taken the strategic decision to reduce the availability of pre-transmission drama drops and box sets outside of its own streaming services, such as on Sky and Virgin, where we cannot serve and monetise dynamic advertising,” the company said. “Therefore, this decision does not reduce existing revenues. Over time and with the launch of ITVX we anticipate that we will see this viewing move to ITV’s streaming services and be more effectively monetised.”",News/Business,ITV warns of ad slump but is on track with new streaming brand launch,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/itv-warns-of-ad-slump-but-is-on-track-with-new-streaming-brand-launch
5/11/2022,"This moment was always going to come. Due to her failing health, Queen Elizabeth II was not present at yesterday’s state opening of parliament – arguably her most important ceremonial performance in the calendar year. Last night’s palace press release explaining that Prince Charles would stand in for his mother follows a pattern of recent similar announcements, the subtext of which is clear: the Queen is not well enough to fulfil the role expected of her. Mounting health problems have plagued the Queen since she unexpectedly pulled out of last year’s Remembrance Sunday service having sprained her back. Her difficulties with physical mobility have persisted and she has described publicly how her Covid-19 infection in February left her “tired and exhausted”. Looking ahead to a busy summer of platinum jubilee events, one wonders whether she will be well enough to join in the celebrations. The British monarchy has to face up to some difficult questions as to what comes next. The word “abdication” has been taboo in the House of Windsor ever since Edward VIII gave up his role as king in 1936 to marry the woman he loved. Indeed, his dereliction of duty exists in direct contrast with the public image the Queen has carefully crafted as the nation’s leading public servant over more than 70 years. Other European royal families have embraced abdication as a positive way of passing on the responsibilities of monarchy to the next generation. In the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, abdication has meant reinvention. The older generation has been allowed to peacefully retire; the young have taken over and given their monarchies a much-needed burst of energy and imagination. In Britain the situation has been different. Rather than abdicate, the Queen had sought to gently retreat from her public duties. Over the past decade, honours investitures, royal tours and other parts of the monarch’s routine have been delegated to members of her family. Now the Queen’s withdrawal from public life has been hastened by medical problems, and the Prince of Wales finds himself regent in all but name. On Tuesday in a packed House of Lords, Prince Charles was flanked by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and his eldest son and heir, the Duke of Cambridge, as he read out the Queen’s speech. Through this choreography there was a clear emphasis on dynastic continuity. The sovereign was symbolically (if not physically) present, not only through her kin, but also through the large imperial state crown that was perched on a small table in front of Prince Charles. It was also clear what the monarchy will look like without the Queen: the focus of the “slimmed down” monarchy will be the direct line of succession. This annual speech is not actually written by the Queen or a member of her family. Rather, it is prepared by government officials and sets out the current administration’s legislative agenda for the next parliamentary session. There were few surprises in terms of content, with an emphasis on post-Covid economic recovery, the government’s “levelling up” programme and its constitutional plans now the UK has left the European Union. Prince Charles did exactly what was required of him. He carefully read out the government’s agenda for the year ahead in just less than nine minutes. He did not stop or falter. There were almost certainly things contained in the speech that he disagrees with – for example, it was notably light on plans for the UK’s climate strategy. But as constitutional monarch he cannot and must not contest government policy. This requirement to bite one’s tongue has been difficult for the Prince of Wales and he has sometimes resorted to backdoor channels in order to put pressure on government officials to support issues that matter to him. Fortunately for the heir to the throne, the issue closest to his heart – the need to live in harmony with the natural world – now commands deep, consensual support among public and politicians alike. Indeed, Prince Charles has enjoyed something of a return to popularity over the past five years, not least because of his image as the environmentalist king-in-waiting. We can be sure that his passion for the natural world will be the defining theme of his reign when the time comes for him to succeed his mother as monarch. The climate crisis is not going away. The main risk here is that fringe politicians on the right successfully challenge the current government’s plans to achieve net zero carbon emissions, at which point the issue of climate strategy becomes politically contentious and therefore something royalty must not discuss. In the meantime, we can expect to see more and more of Prince Charles and less and less of the Queen, as one reign steadily draws to a close and a new reign begins.

5/11/2022,"California officials are deciding the fate of a controversial desalination plant planned along the state’s southern coast, in a vote that comes as the American west is battling an increasingly perilous drought that is starving the region of water resources. After more than a decade of debate about the project, the California coastal commission on Thursday will vote on a proposal for a $1.4bn desalination plant in Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles. As the west grows hotter and drier, states such as California are increasingly seeing water supplies grow scarce. The state is facing its third year of crippling drought, with shortages spurring strict restrictions. Rising heat will mean more water is needed to sustain people, ecosystems, and the state’s thirsty agricultural sector. Desalination plants, which convert seawater into potable water, have long been considered a possible solution, as residents, developers, and policymakers look to capture the water crashing against the California shores. The Huntington Beach plant has prominent backers, including the state’s governor, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Chamber of Commerce, and a slew of other state and local officials. But experts say siphoning water from the sea isn’t a simple answer to a complex and burgeoning crisis. Desalination plants require large amounts of energy to turn salt water into fresh water and have a significant impact on marine life. Critics of the Huntington Beach project have also argued that for all its costs, the plant wouldn’t actually make water more accessible or affordable to the Californians who need it most. “Desalination is intuitively appealing to the person on the street or your average policy maker,” said Dr Gregory Pierce, director of the human right to water solutions lab at University of California, Los Angeles. “But in this case, it is going to make the water rich, richer.” If approved, the Huntington Beach plant would be California’s 13th, and one of the largest in the nation. The facility proposed by project development company Poseidon Water would pump in roughly 106m gallons (401m litres) of seawater each day, converting it to roughly 50m gallons of potable water. What’s leftover – a thick salty brine – would be released back in the ocean. If approved, the construction on the plant is scheduled for as early as 2023 and it can be up and running three years later. Poseidon says the project will have an impact on declining water levels across the state, though the water will only be supplied locally in Orange county. “[The region] will not be pulling water from the Colorado River or northern California, which means that communities to the east of us and the north of us will be able to benefit from this project,” said Jessica Jones, a spokesperson for the company. “It really impacts the entire west. With the drought situation we are in, and that we will continue to face for years and years, it is so important that we look to new supplies” she said. Along with a new source of water, proponents of the project claim it will be a financial boon to the region, bringing in billions in revenue to Orange county and thousands of jobs. The company has committed to purchasing carbon offsets and investing in efforts like reforestation credits to counteract energy use, which Jones says will also be supplied by renewables. Skeptics, however, have questioned the company’s commitment – and ability – to mitigate the environmental impact from the project expected by experts. Along with seawater, desalination plants suck small creatures into the system. Although the company will utilize screens with 1 millimeter mesh to limit the impact on animals, scientists at the Coastal Commission reviewing the proposal estimate the plant would still kill creatures such as fish larvae and plankton, “resulting in substantial losses of marine ecosystem productivity”. Critics have also raised concerns over the plant’s location. Concentrated in an area of industrial development, the facility would be situated on a partially remediated Superfund site, near a wastewater treatment plant, a former oil tank farm, and what was once a dump. Construction could spread contaminants from those sources into nearby disadvantaged communities, carried east by the coastal winds, critics warned. Beyond these concerns, some researchers have cautioned that the project would not benefit those most impacted by California’s water woes. Pierce, the UCLA professor, and a team of researchers studied the proposal in 2019. They concluded that the plant is located in an area of the state that’s not hurting for high-quality, reliable water, but the project would make drinking water less affordable for disadvantaged households in Orange county. “Proponents have vaguely asserted that there will be equity benefits from this plant but haven’t provided any evidence of what that means,” he added. Instead, according to his team’s research, the large cost of the project would raise overall water prices in the region, hurting those who already struggle the most to pay their water bill. Jones, the Poseidon spokesperson, said that while the project may push water rates higher, a local fixed rate could become more affordable than other sources in the dry decades to come. California’s coastal commission, however, estimates that the cost of the project for low-income Orange county residents would be significant. Water rate hikes would “disproportionately impact millions of low-income residents throughout Orange county water district’s service area, the majority of which are people of color”, the commission wrote in its report. “We already know that this thing is not going to make water cheaper and it is not even reliable,” said Andrea León-Grossmann, director of climate action at Azul, a grassroots organization that works with Latino communities to protect the coast from industrialization, noting that previous plants produced less water than promised and can be compromised by oil spills, red tides, and natural disasters. As part of the coalition against Poseidon, Azul and others submitted a 153-page report outlining issues to the coastal commission. Along with higher costs, León-Grossmann said her organization is concerned about plant emissions adding pollution to areas already facing stark disparities; increased dead zones, or areas in the ocean where plants and animals are unable to survive and perish in high numbers; and the threats from sea level rise, tsunamis, and earthquakes, all of which could put the plant – and those who live near it – in greater jeopardy. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has urged the commission to greenlight the project despite the criticism, arguing the drought emergency requires urgent answers. “This administration is committed to ensuring the sustainability of California’s water supply with an all-of-the above strategy, and that includes desalination,” a spokesperson for the governor said in statement. “The governor has supported this project for years and made clear that not approving this project would be a setback, while also encouraging accountability and environmental justice measures. Regions across California must continue to innovate on local projects as climate change makes our state’s water supply more unpredictable.” Last month, Newsom was even more direct when talking about the desalination project with the Bay Area News Group editorial board, calling a vote against it a “big mistake”. “We need more tools in the damn tool kit,” he said, adding: “Be tough. Be fair though. Don’t be ideological.” Pierce argued he’d “make a big distinction between this particular plant and every desalination conversation elsewhere in California”. “This is a backup supply for those who want to keep using water the ways we have used water,” he said. He argued that Orange county residents would benefit more from increased investments in recycling and stormwater to groundwater recapture than from the plant. León-Grossmann, too, said there are still plenty of other options on the table. “We are still flushing toilets with drinking water,” she said, adding that building codes and retrofitting could make homes and businesses more water efficient. “Just plugging the leaks could create more water than the desal plant can create.” Desalination shouldn’t be seen as the simple solution, but rather the last resort, she argued. “It is just not necessary,” León-Grossmann said. “We are not saying never – we are just saying not right now.”",News/Environment,Solution or hazard?

There’s a lovely scene in which the “quiet girl” of the title, 10-year-old Cáit (played by newcomer Catherine Clinch), is reading Heidi before bedtime, and this movie, for all its darkness and suppressed pain, has the solidity, clarity and storytelling gusto of that old-fashioned Alpine children’s tale – about the little girl sent away to live in a beautiful place with her grandfather. The setting, as we can just about work out from the car registration plates, is the early 80s, in County Wexford, Ireland, where Irish is mostly spoken (subtitled in English for the UK). Cáit is a withdrawn little kid, one of many siblings, always wandering off on her own over the farmland: the opening shot of her is a deception of sorts, hinting at a chilling destiny. Cáit is often wide-eyed, silent and watchful, to the irritation of her exhausted and now once-again heavily pregnant mother (Kate Nic Chonaonaigh) and her thuggish, abusive and hungover dad (Michael Patric). Naturally without telling Cáit or being mindful of her feelings in any way, her parents decide they need a break from looking after her and pack the girl off for the summer to her mother’s cousin Eibhlín (Carrie Crowley) and her taciturn farmer husband Seán (Andrew Bennett), whose vastly more prosperous and better-run smallholding infuriates Cáit’s sullen dad when he drives up in his car to drop her off. He can hardly summon the good manners to make conversation before getting back in his car to drive back home and in his boorish haste, he has a lapse of memory which is to have serious consequences for Cáit’s new life. Crowley and Bennett give heart-wrenchingly excellent performances as the unhappy, childless couple who have taken Cáit in: particularly Crowley as Eibhlín, a well-bred, intelligent, elegant woman who is brightly engaged with the child as no one has ever been in her life. But Cáit is quick to understand that they have a “secret”, which her sneering father already seems to know about. As this long, hot summer progresses with the endlessness of childhood, Kate McCullough’s superb cinematography and Emma Lowney’s production design create a magically beautiful new world for Cáit to feel at once threatened and exalted by: almost every shot is a vividly composed, painterly gem. Above all, there is a mysterious artificial rainwater pond in surrounding woodland which Eibhlín says has supernatural powers. A vinegary tang of black comedy and cynicism is provided by neighbour Úna (a terrific performance from Joan Sheehy) who looks after Cáit one afternoon and brutally tells the girl all about what her foster parents aren’t telling her – and Bairéad cleverly allows you to suspect that Eibhlín wanted Úna to shoulder the awful burden of revealing this. Cáit’s quietness is perhaps the quietness of an abuse victim, or perhaps the quietness of a clever person who knows that not talking is the way to survive. As Seán tells her: “Many’s the person missed the opportunity to say nothing.” And when Cáit returns home, it is her failure to obey this golden rule, and blurting out the phrase “nothing happened”, which is to cause a new stab of pain. In another kind of movie, a lazier kind, all this stillness and rural beauty, seen by an enigmatically silent child who is accustomed to vanishing invisibly into the landscape, would be the ominous foretaste of something horrible or violent to come just before the final credits. But The Quiet Girl is doing something gentler than this, as well as realer and truer. It is a jewel.  The Quiet Girl is released on 13 May in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.",Arts/Film,The Quiet Girl review – deeply moving tale of rural Ireland already feels like a classic,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/11/the-quiet-girl-review-beauty-and-pain-in-rural-ireland
