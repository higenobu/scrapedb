3/21/2022,"Victoria’s opposition has backflipped on its pledge to scrap the Andrews government’s mental health levy, saying the revenue is now a necessary part of the state’s finances. Announced in last year’s state budget, the mental health and wellbeing levy on big businesses is forecast to raise $843m each year to fund mental health services. The levy, which began in January, was a recommendation of the royal commission into Victoria’s mental health system. On Monday evening, the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, conceded he had changed his intention to axe the levy due the revenue it creates. “It is highly difficult for us to remove these taxes when the budget has been screwed by the Labor party to the extent that it has,” Guy said. “The blowouts in a number of major projects, alone, could have paid for the entirety of the mental health budget in one year.” But the deputy premier and mental health minister, James Merlino, seized on the development and claimed the opposition had been “spooked” by the South Australian election, which delivered a landslide victory for Labor on Saturday. In South Australia, Labor ran a campaign on the issue of health funding and ambulance ramping. Merlino said the opposition understood it could not “go to an election talking about cuts to health”. “They’ve come out today, they’re claiming that they’re not going to cut $3.7bn in mental health funding, yet that is exactly what they’re going to do,” Merlino said. “That’s their form when they’re in government.” The opposition had previously argued that mental health reform should be funded with existing revenue. In February, when asked if he could “categorically” confirm the mental health levy would be scrapped if the Coalition won the state election, Guy replied: “Yes.” On Monday, the shadow treasurer, David Davis, said the “mental health levy will remain”. “We did oppose it at the time but the bill is now legislated, it’s now through,” Davis told reporters on Monday. “We accept that the levy is there now … it’s part of the costs of funding our system.” Under the levy, businesses paying taxable wages of $10m or more in Victoria pay a 0.5% surcharge on them. This rises to 1% for businesses paying wages over $100m. For the transition period – 1 January until 30 June – the respective annual thresholds are $5m and $50m. The levy was designed to fund the Victoria’s government’s spend on mental health reform – estimated to provide $3.7bn over the four years to 2026 – announced in the wake of the royal commission. The scathing report found the state’s mental health system was “crisis-driven” and not designed to support people living with mental illness or psychological distress. The levy backtrack comes a week after the state’s opposition said it would support the government’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 – which it opposed during the 2018 election. Emma Kealy, opposition spokesperson for mental health, said if Victoria did not hire more mental health workers it would “never see the end of the impacts of the Covid pandemic”. “Labor failed to develop and to train mental health workers in the state of Victoria,” she said. “As a result, children can’t get the support they need when they need it. And they’re turning up to emergency departments in droves.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Last month, the opposition vowed to offer incentives to attract more health workers within its first 100 days in office if it wins the November election. The incentive scheme would include financial support to train more workers at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, relocation packages to attract international workers, and additional internship and student placements for psychologists and psychiatrists to expedite their transition into the field.",News/Australia news,Matthew Guy drops plan to scrap Victorian mental health levy on big businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/matthew-guy-drops-plan-to-scrap-victorian-mental-health-levy-on-big-businesses
3/21/2022,"Unusually high temperatures in both Antarctica and the Arctic in recent days have shocked researchers, who warn that extremes will become more common as a result of the climate crisis. Concordia station, high on the Antarctic Plateau, hit a record temperature of -11.8C on Friday, more than 40C warmer than seasonal norms. Vostok station registered a temperature of -17.7C, beating its record by 15C. At the same time, some stations near the north pole reached 30C above normal, with records broken in Norway and unusually warm temperatures recorded in Greenland and the Russian archipelago of Franz Josef Land. The Antarctic continent as a whole on Friday was about 4.8C warmer compared to a baseline temperature between 1979 and 2000, the Associated Press reported. On the same day, the Arctic as a whole was 3.3C warmer than the 1979 to 2000 average. “Both of these weather events are related to the poleward transport of heat and moisture,” said Dr Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at Colorado State University, on Twitter. Alex Sen Gupta, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said strong winds coming from Australia were contributing to the unusual temperatures in Antarctica. “We have had a combination of strong weather systems over the Southern Ocean to the south of Australia that aligned to produce very strong polewards winds stretching from Australia to eastern Antarctica.” An atmospheric river was also a major contributing factor to the high temperatures in the eastern Antarctic, according to Prof Julie Arblaster, a climate researcher at Monash University. “These are rivers of moisture in the air that bring warm and moist air to certain locations, and there was a really significant one occurring in that region over Antarctica.” The moist air has trapped heat over the continent, resulting in the warm surface temperatures. The remarkably intense atmospheric river continues to pump and diffuse moisture across the East Antarctic plateau. pic.twitter.com/VfwPGfwE1F “Right now we’ve got the lowest sea ice extent on record in Antarctica,” Arblaster said. “A lot of the sea ice around Antarctica that might be there normally close to the continent is now ocean. It would be really interesting to understand if there’s any connection between the low Antarctic sea ice extent and these warm temperatures.” The heat in eastern Antarctica was an “extraordinary event”, Arblaster said. “These are temperature anomalies of between 15 to 40C.” Gupta said: “It looks like large parts of eastern Antarctica reached over 20C warmer than normal. Warming started on the 15th [March] and still persists.” Prof Matt King, who leads the Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science, said a lack of longterm temperature records made the heatwave difficult to contextualise historically. “The first of the precise temperature records start in the late 1950s, so it’s really hard to work out what’s remarkable and what’s not,” King said. But, he warned, the impact of the climate crisis meant events like these would be a “view to the future. Sometime down the track, depending on what we do with our carbon emissions, we might see these types of temperatures much more regularly.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the Arctic, temperatures have increased by nearly 1C in the past decade, with Northern Siberia and the Canadian Arctic warming three times faster than the rest of the world. A record temperature of 38C was recorded in the Russian Arctic during an Arctic heatwave in the 2020 northern hemisphere summer. “This weather event is an example of atmospheric warming above the ice shelves,” said Prof Andrew Mackintosh, head of the school of earth, atmosphere and environment at Monash University. In Antarctica, the heat “would have to persist for a fairly long period of time to make a substantial difference”, he said. The main concern is a weakening of ice shelves, extensions of ice sheets that float over the ocean. They play an important role in restraining inland ice. “Once we lose ice shelves, grounded ice that sits inland would flow out faster … go to the ocean and cause sea level rise,” Mackintosh said. King agreed, saying there had been indicators in recent days of potential surface melt and snow softening along the eastern Antarctic coastline. “In some ways, the future of Antarctica will look like the future of the Arctic, where we’ve had many degrees of warming there over the last 50 years or so,” he said. There has been a sharp drop in Arctic sea ice this month at Svalbard, which has experienced anomalously high temperatures. Last year, researchers found that sea ice across much of the Arctic was thinning twice as quickly as previously thought. The last fully intact ice shelf in the Canadian Arctic collapsed in 2020 as a result of rising temperatures. The melting of ice results in a vicious cycle: a greater area of dark water is exposed, learning to increased absorption of the sun’s energy, which then causes more warming.",News/Environment,Extremes of 40C above normal: what’s causing ‘extraordinary’ heating in polar regions?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/21/extremes-of-40c-above-normal-whats-causing-extraordinary-heating-in-polar-regions
3/21/2022,"In the late 1920s and early 1930s, two sleepy corners of Essex woke up to the modern world. Czech footwear giant Tomáš Baťa’s model town rose from nothing in the East Tilbury marshes: a workers’ community with everything a short walk from the front doors of its flat-roofed houses, from the shoe factory to the football pitch, the ballroom to the cinema. Window manufacturer Francis Crittall, meanwhile, had just turned “a cluster of rural cottages” into Silver End, a similar model village outside Braintree. Today, with the fashion industry’s production now centred in east Asia, the tattered Bata shoe factory is listed, though its communal buildings are defunct. Silver End’s art deco villas have fared better, as restoration-worthy trophy properties. Wanting an alternative take on Essex’s modernism, in 2019 Southend’s Focal Point Gallery invited the Chinese artist Cui Jie to visit these sites. Cui has made a name for herself as a chronicler of modern Chinese experience, exploring the swiftly shifting urban landscape in Beijing, Hong Kong and her home city, Shanghai, in layered, impressionistic paintings. Prevented from returning to the UK when the pandemic hit, she found, in Shanghai, an unexpected point of comparison: the Caoyang New Village of 1951. Although conceived as part of Mao’s very different communist economic vision, like the Essex developments this artisan textile workers’ housing project was all-inclusive, with a cinema, mall, hospital, school and plenty of green space. And as with Essex, its vision of communal life collapsed as industrial conditions changed. It was less the architecture that interested Cui, however, than “the elements that are nowhere to be found today: who used to live there, the communal lifestyle and intimacy between people. Unlike buildings, traces of life can easily fade away.” A number of her works explore how communities’ aspirations and ideology are shaped by our surroundings. In drawings, Caoyang’s social realist public statues – including weavers with arms raised like conquering divinities – merge with edifices from the Bata estate. Elsewhere, Bata and Caoyang’s cinemas blend. Although western and Chinese movies were poles apart politically, she points out “they were both ritual spaces where the public is to be collectively entranced. We can clearly see the aesthetic function of the statues: they reveal the ideal state of trance.” Other works explore how our collective inner life is changing now. In a night scene, Harlow town hall is overshadowed by a broadcast mast and enveloped in a densely woven black grid that suggests the web of our digital era, where human relationships are monetised by social media. While the workers’ villages conjure a bygone flowering of integrated living, Cui also wants us to consider what lessons should be learned from past mistakes. “Collectivism is worthy of reconsideration,” she says, “but the blueprints behind these practices also call for critiques. Endless industrialisation entails ecological crises. We need to rethink the relationship between us and nature.” The connections between us, the built environment and nature start to erupt in paintings that, unusually for Cui, depict people. In her series Ground Invading Figures, villagers appear in comfortable intimacy with hands and knees touching. Yet the backgrounds are outlined and highlighted, so they butt into these self-contained groups. While recalling maps or aerial shots or architects’ plans, for Cui these segments also “pertain to nature, the omnipresent sky, forests or even air, and appear in the form of an ecological crisis”. What usually goes overlooked is rendered bright, outsized and hard to ignore, “devouring the edges” of the human subjects. Silver End Village, 2021Cui Jie explores commonalities between purpose-built workers’ villages in Essex and Caoyang New Village in Shanghai. “To maximise profit, [British] factories moved to places where both lands and human resources were cheaper – east Asia for example,” she says. “Caoyang New Village declined with China’s move from a planned economy to market economy in the 1980s. This kind of communal life is long gone, and memories of it are fading away.” Basildon, 2021 (main picture)Cui’s new paintings take in modernist visions across Essex, including the shops in Basildon nestled beneath a long-gone, curving overhang. Suspended in abstract space, buildings appear like apparitions or, as she puts it, “unreachable utopian dreams”. Silver End Village and Caoyang Sculpture, 2021“The drawings emphasise a statue of a female spinning worker wearing an apron, holding cotton flowers high in her right hand and fabrics in her left,” says Cui. “In the Caoyang New Village, many residents were female textile workers and the statue was placed by the entrance to the communal park. Now it’s removed.” Ground Invading Figure #50, 2022A series of paintings depicts the villages’ first inhabitants, while bringing the background into focus in a way that’s intentionally jarring. Figures were inspired by early Caoyang publicity shots, and Cui’s research into daily life in Essex included old films and photography of sports events and dances. New Model Village is at Focal Point Gallery, Southend-on-Sea, until 12 June.",Arts/Art and design,"Cui Jie: ‘This kind of communal life is long gone, and memories of it are fading away’",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/21/cui-jie-this-kind-of-communal-life-is-long-gone-and-memories-of-it-are-fading-away
3/21/2022,"The sanatorium makes for a wonderful crucible: an enclosed space inside which the events of a novel can play out. Thomas Mann used the heightened sensibilities of a group of confined tuberculosis patients in his 1924 masterpiece, The Magic Mountain. In it, our hero, Hans Castorp, goes to visit a consumptive cousin at a sanatorium in Davos. He ends up staying for seven years, engaging in metaphysical jousting with a host of other residents – each of whom represents a different approach to the great philosophical questions of the age – and falling in love with the alluring Clawdia Chauchat. The novel ends with Castorp going off to fight (and, we presume, die) in the first world war. AE Ellis was the pen name of the playwright Derek Lindsay, an enigmatic figure who produced one great, celebrated novel, The Rack, in 1958 and then, aside from a couple of largely forgotten plays, disappeared from view. The Rack was described by Graham Greene as rising like a “monument above the cemeteries of literature”. It is a novel in complex dialogue with Mann’s The Magic Mountain, and, to my mind at least, equally masterful. I reread The Rack with the weight of my second bout of Covid still heavy on my chest: there is now an extraordinary and dreadful resonance in a book that charts, perhaps better than anything else I’ve read, the tortuous paths of illness. Paul Davenant is our strangely blank hero. He was orphaned as a small child (like Castorp in The Magic Mountain, like Lindsay himself) and brought up by an uncle. He was an infantry officer in the second world war and then attended Cambridge. Now 27, he is one of a group of TB patients brought to Brisset, a fictional sanatorium town in the Alps, by an international students’ organisation. Les Alpes is the name of the sanatorium in which the students will be treated, part of a pan-European charitable effort that sees them lodged alongside private patients (without enjoying the same benefits). Davenant is the oldest and most sickly of the British students. While the others see it as an opportunity for an extended holiday, showing as they do few symptoms, and happy to be able to step into a world without obligations, Davenant is soon subjected to a host of what the sanatorium’s three doctors – Vernet, Bruneau and Florian – refer to as “tortures”. The description of the so-called cures to which, until relatively recently, TB patients were subjected is like something out of the middle ages. The rack of the title is in part a reference to these treatments, and partly a description of the existential pangs that the patient endures. TB at this time was incurable – the best Davenant can hope for is, as one of the doctors puts it, “to obtain some compromise with the bug that will enable you to live with it on fairly amicable terms”. He is given a pneumothorax, in which the lungs are collapsed and kept artificially compressed by the regular injection of air into the chest cavity. Davenant is soon left wondering if “it would be better if he killed himself now, voluntarily, before the machine of hygiene swabbed him out of life with antiseptic and hypodermic”. Into this world, in which the students obsess over their illnesses, discussing Shakespeare and Voltaire, Nietzsche and Molière, comes Michèle Duchesne, a 17-year-old girl with a “slender, boyish figure”. She’s referred to by one of the patients as “le petit gosse” – the little kid. Davenant falls utterly, unsettlingly in love with her. The second half of the novel is a warped, sometimes hallucinogenic love story, where we can’t help but feel that part of Davenant’s investment in Michèle is an attempt to capture some lost element of his own youth. The Rack is not an easy read, particularly now, but it is a vital one, a novel of big ideas with a febrile, twisted sentimentality at its heart. It asks us to consider what makes life worth living, and what, in the end, we would be prepared to die for.

3/21/2022,"Just in time for Mother’s Day comes this absolute heartwarmer from the American journalist turned documentary maker Sian-Pierre Regis, about ageism, pensioner poverty and the gig economy, but mostly about his brilliant, wonderful mother. It begins in Boston, when Liverpool-born Rebecca Danigelis is suddenly fired from her live-in housekeeping manager job at a fancy hotel, where she has worked for decades. The 75-year-old is handed two weeks’ pay and an eviction notice to vacate the apartment at the top of the hotel, where she raised her two sons as a single mother. Regis, a 32-year-old freelance journalist, begins filming. His early recordings on iPhone capture his mother’s total despair. She has $600 in the bank, having cashed her savings to put him through college. No one is replying to her job applications. She feels invisible – though she’s anything but, with her platinum white hair pinned into a chic updo and immaculate makeup. As her son says, she’s a woman of “grit, sass and determination”. At her lowest point, he asks her to write a bucket list of things she could never do because she was always working. He raises $60,000 on Kickstarter and together they tick off her list. At this point, Duty Free begins to feel ever so slightly gimmicky, as the pair set off to “milk a cow” and “skydive in Hawaii”. But Regis teases out the emotional stories behind his mother’s list. When she tells him that she wants to take a hip-hop dance lesson, he’s surprised. But Danigelis explains that, as the white mother of bi-racial sons (Regis’s dad is black), she wants to share the feeling she has seen in him when listening to hip-hop. And he doesn’t go easy on his mother in some of the scenes shot in Liverpool, while visiting her daughter from her first marriage, who was raised by her sister. It makes for one or two emotionally difficult scenes. But the overwhelming feeling here is the pure pleasure of watching a seventysomething woman, who has felt invisible and discarded, be seen by so many: interviewed on US daytime TV; her story going viral and acquiring tens of thousands of adoring fans on Instagram; having the time of her life.

3/21/2022,"Saudi Arabia has grand plans to become a powerhouse in the world of eSports and gaming. The kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund – a $500bn entity chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – announced a new gaming company in January 2022 with the intention of staking its claim in the booming industry. The Savvy Gaming Group went on to purchase ESL Gaming – one of the largest independent eSport entities in the world – from Sweden-based Modern Times Group in an all-cash transaction of $1.05bn. It also purchased FACEIT, one of the biggest tournament organizers in eSports, for $500m, and later merged the two entities to form the ESL FACEIT Group. “ESL and FACEIT have both been fundamental to the incredible growth of eSports and competitive gaming globally, with over 30 years combined in the industry,” the newly-formed ESL FACEIT Group said in a press release. “Together, they will form a new driving force in the fast-growing but fragmented eSports landscape at a critical time in the evolution of the industry.” Weeks later, Saudi launched a new billion-dollar initiative to transform the kingdom into a leading digital entertainment hub. The initiative, aptly named Ignite, is expected to fund the development of new games, as well as infrastructure for gaming studios and arenas. The kingdom also revealed plans to establish a big budget games studio in Neom, the proposed futuristic $500bn mega city in the Saudi desert. The studio, which is expected to produce and distribute games by a major publisher, would be the first of its kind in the Middle East. Saudi’s latest investments in gaming come on the heels of the kingdom’s acquisition of Japanese game company SNK in 2020, and its $3bn investment in shares of game companies such as Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard, and Take-Two Interactive Software. Gaming has grown tremendously in popularity across the Middle East and North Africa region. Gaming consumption in the kingdom is projected to reach $6.8bn by 2030, according to the Boston Consulting Group, an entity that has worked closely with the Saudi crown prince to enhance his image. By zeroing in on the burgeoning eSports market, Saudi Arabia has added a new layer to its soft power strategy in an attempt to polish its public image on the international stage. The process is known as sportswashing, a term popularized by Amnesty International to describe the use of sports by oppressive governments to legitimize their regimes and distract from their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia’s strategic investment in sports and entertainment events dates back to November 2016 when Mohammed bin Salman ordered the kingdom’s General Sports Authority to set up a fund to bolster sports activity in the country. The objectives of the fund were to diversify the kingdom’s investments as part of Vision 2030, a proposal intended to reduce Saudi’s dependence on oil. Since then, Saudi Arabia has transformed into a global hub for sports events, having signed a 10-year, $650m deal for a Formula One motor racing event, invested millions in a Saudi International golf event, established a long-term partnership with WWE and hosted some of the biggest boxing showdowns in recent memory. The kingdom has also hired the Boston Consulting Group to help lobby its interest in hosting a World Cup event in the not-so-distant future. Last year, a group led by Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund purchased Newcastle United. It is arguably one of the kingdom’s most significant investments, as it offered Saudi Arabia an influential position in English football, as well as an international platform to upgrade its public image and distract from its recent abuses, including the infamous assassination of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its devastating war in Yemen that caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and its crackdown on intellectuals, reformers, and women’s rights activists. And while the kingdom has managed to make strides in its eSports ambitions, it has also faced opposition from critics uncomfortable with its entry into the industry. In July 2020, Riot Games’ League of Legends European Championship withdrew from its partnership with Neom less than a day after first announcing the deal. The decision was taken after fans threatened to boycott the league over the Saudis’ anti-LGBTQ+ laws. Other Gulf states also faced backlash as they attempted to pivot to eSports. Last month, Ubisoft moved its Rainbow Six Siege eSports tournament from the UAE after 13,000 fans signed a petition that called the decision “insulting to our identity.” It is also possible that Saudi Arabia may face renewed scrutiny for its sportswashing tactics in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Over the past few weeks, various international sports organizations and governing bodies have imposed sanctions on Russia and its athletes as a direct result of the war. This has, in turn, led to a revival in the discussion about how other authoritarian regimes have weaponized sports for political gain. Nonetheless, it is more than likely that Saudi Arabia will continue to forge ahead with its ambitious sportswashing strategy, expanding its scope of influence to not only include traditional sports and entertainment but digital space and its endless potential, as well.

3/21/2022,"The Donmar Warehouse in London is to stage a “searing” dystopian play in which a teenage jury hold their elders to account for crimes against the climate. The Trials, written by British playwright Dawn King (Foxfinder), is set in a near future in which a radical green government is in power and must manage scarce resources. The Donmar’s artistic director, Michael Longhurst, who has dubbed the courtroom drama “12 Angry Young People”, described it as a punchy, galvanising and “quite shocking” play which changed his perception of the world. The cast of jurors is to be found as part of an engagement programme with local community organisations in London and will give a dozen new actors the opportunity to make their stage debut at the Donmar. Longhurst said he was committed to discovering the next generation of acting talent, in particular those “who don’t have the standard routes into the industry”. The Trials, which was nominated for the Susan Smith Blackburn prize and is currently being staged in a different production at Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus in Germany, will receive its UK premiere at the Donmar in August. In King’s play, a jury of 12– to 17-year-olds struggle with the responsibility of weighing up the fate of three adult defendants. That trio will be played by well-established theatre actors. The production, directed by Natalie Abrahami, will be hard-hitting yet hopeful, said Longhurst, and explore “what we can do practically” in an age of climate emergency. The Donmar, which last year appointed Zoë Svendsen as its climate dramaturg, is like many theatres striving to reduce its carbon footprint. Recent renovations to the building, at a site once used as a brewery and banana-ripening warehouse in Covent Garden, has led to improved ventilation and environmental sustainability. The Trials is part of a new Donmar season that includes, in June, the European premiere of A Doll’s House, Part 2 by American dramatist Lucas Hnath which is set 15 years after Ibsen’s classic. Longhurst said it was audacious of Hnath to propose: “Do you know what this revolutionary masterpiece needs? A sequel!” Ibsen’s play famously ends with Nora slamming the door on her marriage; Hnath’s followup, directed by James Macdonald, opens with a knock at the door. “It’s like a series of showdowns as Nora has to face the people in her family household that she left – and they are not necessarily happy to see her,” said Longhurst. “The play forces Nora to weigh the choices that she made.” Nora will be played by Noma Dumezweni who starred as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in the West End and on Broadway. This marks Dumezweni’s first return to the London stage since that success, after recently working in television (including The Undoing) and film (she is in Disney’s new version of The Little Mermaid, slated for release next year). Dumezweni is also featured in a forthcoming photographic exhibition at the theatre, We. Black Women curated by Joan Iyiola, for which actors – including Sheila Atim and Naomie Harris – have interviewed their unsung heroes. The Band’s Visit, a “delicate and emotional” Israel-based musical adapted from the 2007 film of the same name, will also receive its European premiere at the Donmar this autumn. David Yazbek and Itamar Moses’ musical triumphed on Broadway where it won 10 Tony awards in 2018. Longhurst will direct the new production himself. “Our USP is intimacy,” he said of the 251-seat venue he has run since 2019, “and it’s so unusual to be so close to a musical.” In September, the Donmar will collaborate with Tara theatre to stage Silence, adapted from Kavita Puri’s Partition Voices: Untold British Stories. The production will mark 75 years since the partition of India and draw on the testimonies of people who experienced life under the rule of the British Raj. Puri’s book has been adapted by four writers – Sonali Bhattacharyya, Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, Ishy Din and Alexandra Wood – in order to tell what Longhurst called a “story of division with a collective act of storytelling”. Abdul Shayek, artistic director of Tara theatre, added: “As Britain holds up a mirror to its colonial history that has shaped our present day reality, many of us are asking questions of our past and who we are.” Silence, said Shayek, “will try to capture the unbiased documentation of the stories in Kavita’s book and the very real need to recognise that this is our shared history, a British story regardless of the colour of your skin”. The production will run at both the Donmar and Tara theatre in Earlsfield, south-west London.",Arts/Stage,New season at London’s Donmar to include ‘shocking’ play on climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/21/new-season-london-donmar-shocking-play-climate-crisis
3/21/2022,"The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has conceded that his team and seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton are not in contention for the Formula One world championship after the season’s opening race in Bahrain. Hamilton has acknowledged that the team have no quick fix for the fundamental problem afflicting their car as they struggle to get the best out of it in the season’s initial meetings. The somewhat shocking admission from the previously all-conquering Mercedes squad who have won the last eight consecutive constructors’ championships and seven of the last eight drivers’ titles comes after their competitive position in this season’s F1 field was confirmed in Bahrain, with Mercedes some way off the pace of Ferrari and Red Bull. Ferrari took a superb one-two victory with Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz in the race on Sunday. Hamilton and his teammate George Russell were third and fourth, but in positions that flattered to deceive. They took the places after both the Red Bulls of reigning champion Max Verstappen and Sergio Pérez suffered fuel system-related retirements late in the race. Up until that point the position of both Mercedes cars had been fifth and sixth. Moreover they were well off the pace of the two leading teams. At just over mid-distance the four front-runners had over a 15-second advantage over both Mercedes’, with Leclerc in front, a full 30-seconds up on Hamilton. Mercedes had been fully aware they were struggling, their car suffering from the downforce stalling-related problem known as porpoising. With the evidence from Bahrain, Wolff acknowledged that until they solve the issue they are currently in no position to mount a challenge. “If you look at the pecking order today it seems a very long shot to even think about being in contention for any of the championships,” he said. “Realistically when you are third on the road you can’t think about winning it.” Hamilton, who has been positive despite the setbacks his team faces, was clear that the problems will not be solved before the following meeting in Saudi Arabia next weekend, noting that the issues cannot be addressed merely by adjusting the setup of the car. “I’m hoping for the next race we manage to find some improvements,” he said. “But it’s a fundamental issue that’s going to take a little bit longer to fix.” He was, however, pleased with theway his Mercedes team had reacted to their setbacks. The team have previously shown fortitude and dedication to fight back against a strong Ferrari in 2017 and 2018, ultimately taking victory and last season were resilient in forcing the title fight to the wire against Red Bull and still securing the constructors’ championship despite Hamilton’s disappointment in losing the drivers’ title. “Given that we have been faced with these challenges which we were not expecting, no one’s been down during this phase where we’ve been struggling,” Hamilton said. “Everyone’s stayed positive, everyone’s just kept their head down and kept working. No one’s moaned and that’s great to see.” Wolff said it was up to the team to “regain land, centimetre by centimetre”, in what will clearly be a drawn-out fightback and that they could not simply throw parts at the car until they had solved the main issue with the porpoising. Optimism remains however that when they do so they will be able to be very competitive, as Wolff was expectant they could “unleash the performance that we hope to be in the car”. Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner said he believed his team and driver Verstappen would recover from their disappointment to come back, buoyed by the pace they showed before the mechanical failures in Bahrain. “Maxi is obviously disappointed but he’s pragmatic,” he said. “It’s a long year and he knows we’ve got a good car. We’ll understand this issue, get on top of it, and come back next weekend.

3/21/2022,"Down an unassuming street on the outskirts of Warsaw, among a series of warehouses, a hostel has been set up to host non-Ukrainian refugees among the nearly two million who have fled to Poland since the Russian invasion. In the entrance hallway is a poster with messages from recent Afghan guests: “Thank you to Poland,” reads one. “People don’t think about the fact that there are non-Ukrainian refugees from Ukraine and there are for sure some people who are afraid,” said Marianna Ossolińska, who is managing the hostel, an initiative of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia. “That’s why this hostel was created because we couldn’t accommodate or host people anywhere else. We have the entire world here,” she said, of the many nationalities. “It’s harder to find a place for single men and people are sometimes probably more willing to take mothers and children,” she said. “Most of our guests arrive very tired, they need a quiet place to rest and feel safe. Then they can start to think about what they will do next. I get the feeling that many of them have no idea.” Guests, Ossolińska said, typically stay for about three days while they plan their next steps. There have been no issues so far, but Ossolińska prefers that the location is not publicised due to safety concerns for guests, most of whom are not Ukrainian. In recent weeks it was reported that Polish far-right nationalists attacked groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern refugees who had crossed the Ukrainian border. Mustafa*, 24, from Algeria, is a current guest. A business student in Kharkiv, he fled to Poland and came to the hostel three days ago after running out of money and not having anywhere else to go. “I applied to the business school here. I want to stay if I can find somewhere [to live],” he said, “I wouldn’t go back to Algeria, it’s very corrupt. I don’t even have a thought to go back.” Mustafa is unsure about his immigration status. “I don’t want to be illegal. I called the Algerian embassy and they said it’s OK to stay here,” he said. Mustafa hopes to remain in Warsaw if he can find a job and enrol at a university in the capital. Yusup, 25, is originally from Turkmenistan and has lived in Ukraine for the past 10 years. A day before the Russian invasion he submitted his final documents for citizenship, which now feels like a dream. He arrived at the hostel with his Ukrainian wife after hearing through friends that it was a safe place. “We decided to come and ask if they had a space and the volunteers were so kind and they offered us a room,” he said. Arslan*, 29, also from Turkmenistan, and his Ukrainian wife, Daria, 25, also found the hostel through friends. Arslan does not wish to give his real name because he is worried for his family in Turkmenistan. “It’s not a good situation there,” he said. Arslan trained as a general surgeon in Ukraine and had learned to speak the language. The couple now hope to travel to Germany. Olga, 28, a Ukrainian from the Donbas region, arrived with a large group of friends from Turkmenistan who sought refuge in the hostel. “Since 2014 me and my family have known war, killing and what it is to die,” she said. While the hostel’s doors are open to everyone, Agnieszka Karol, 45, a Polish volunteer, said it was an important safe space for those who might not otherwise find accommodation. “Not every Polish family is ready to accept someone who is not of Ukrainian origin,” she said. “There are two women with children who arrived this morning who are Ukrainian nationals but are Roma so it also might be difficult to find a place for them.” Ossolińska, like many Polish citizens who have stepped up in response to the crisis, juggles volunteering with a full-time job. “I don’t know anyone who is looking at what is happening and is doing nothing,” she said. * Names have been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘We have the entire world here’: Polish hostel taking in foreigners from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/21/poland-ukraine-refugees-entire-world-hostel-everyone-welcome
3/21/2022,"Kimberley Kitching’s husband has, during her funeral service, criticised a “cantankerous cabal” over its treatment of the late Victorian senator. Family, friends, and state and federal politicians from both sides of politics gathered at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne on Monday to farewell the Labor senator who died suddenly on 10 March of a suspected heart attack. She was 52. Her husband, Andrew Landeryou, told mourners they married in the same cathedral two decades ago. “It feels like yesterday looking down on a grey Derby Day that I saw her walking in,” he said. “Her customary 45 minutes late, looking absolutely radiant, and as she did the sun streamed down directly on her as she stepped toward our married life.” Landeryou said when Kitching died there was, inside her car, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne she bought for a dinner party planned for that evening and a pie from a bakery she knew he liked. “It’s a poignant reminder to me of her thoughtfulness, that even when she had a lot on her mind, other than call me, I think it was the last thing she did,” he said. Some supporters have appeared to draw links between Kitching’s sudden death and political issues she was facing, including her preselection ahead of the upcoming federal election and allegations she had been bullied and ostracised by senior Labor members. Landeryou made reference to the “unpleasantness” she had faced. “The simple truth of it is that Kimberley’s political and moral judgment was vastly superior to the small number who opposed her internally,” he said. “And of course, there’s a lot I could say about the unpleasantness of a cantankerous cabal – not all of them in parliament – that was aimed at Kimba, and the intensity of it did baffle and hurt her. “But I hope it’s sufficient to say she deserved so very much better. The truth is the vast majority of the Labor family were welcoming and supportive and encouraging and admiring of Kimberley and they told her so often.” He said he did not blame “any one person, or any one meeting, or any campaign of unpleasantness” for her death, describing it as “God’s will”. “Her friends and ferociously loyal staff are angry about how she was treated, of course they are, and I have no quarrel with them about that. They know what they saw with their own eyes,” he said. “If I am angry with anyone, I am angry with myself, I am angry I wasn’t driving her around that busy day as I often did, I am angry I didn’t meddle enough in her health, I’m angry I failed and failed again to persuade her to slow down, I’m angry I couldn’t and didn’t protect her from menace and I fear I attracted some.” Former Labor leader Bill Shorten, one of Kitching’s closest friends and who was instrumental in her securing her Senate position in 2016, urged the party to “channel their grief” into winning the upcoming federal election. “She understood – in the marrow of her bones – that the people who count on Labor count, above all, on Labor government,” Shorten said. “So I know if she were here with us still all her energy and activism and enthusiasm and the powerful force of her personality would have been dedicated to a Labor victory in May.” Shorten said her office put nearly 12,000 questions on notice to the federal government this parliamentary term and ferociously scrutinised its ministers during estimates, which he described as akin to Kitching “running out onto the MCG”. He said she was instrumental in Australia adopting Magnitsky-style laws and stood up for the people of Ukraine, China’s Muslim Uyghurs, the Tibetans and the pro-democracy activists of Hong Kong. Shorten said Kitching helped rescue 30 people from Afghanistan after the Taliban took control last August, including a Hazara woman named Roya, who was present at the funeral service. Kitching’s father, William Kitching, said his daughter was a bright student and a lover of literature and languages – she spoke five including Latin. He said she made a difference through “respectful, not vengeful, public discourse”. “Today we honour Kim’s good life and trust that our present sense of almost paralysing grief and deep melancholia will be gradually banished by joyful memories of an engaging woman and daughter whom we knew so well,” Kitching said. A statement from the Dalai Lama, who Kitching met in 2017, was read at the beginning of the service, as was a statement from the Senate president, Slade Brockman, who described her as “tough, determined and forensic – occasionally fiery”. “The Senate will be poorer without her,” Brockman’s statement read. The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, the deputy leader, Richard Marles, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, the former premier Steve Bracks and senior Coalition figures including former prime minister Tony Abbott, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, the defence minister, Peter Dutton, the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, the government’s Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, and the Victorian Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, attended the service. Senators Kristina Keneally, Penny Wong and Katy Gallagher, who were named in media reports as having allegedly “ostracised” Kitching, were also in attendance, as was the Melbourne lord mayor, Sally Capp, the Victorian state secretary of the CFMEU, John Setka, the Health Workers Union secretary, Diana Asmar, and Sky News’ Peta Credlin and Andrew Bolt.

3/21/2022,"Abloodied man empties his wallet to his creditor while being mercilessly attacked by an unprovoked assailant. This is the plight of Ukraine, which recently made a scheduled interest payment to private lenders as tanks rolled over its land and missiles struck its cities. Even before Vladimir Putin started bombing apartment blocks and maternity hospitals, Ukraine was Europe’s poorest country as measured by GDP per capita – significantly poorer than Albania. Yet this war-ravaged country is saddled with unsustainable debt – and as the piles of rubble grow, so do the repayments. That’s debt for Ukraine, but profits for western hedge funds. War, for some, is the ultimate money-spinner. Since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 – triggering a conflict in the east that had claimed thousands of lives before the current invasion – Ukraine has been forced to borrow $61bn (£46bn) from external lenders, according to calculations by the Jubilee Debt Campaign; a small sliver has been paid off, but what remains represents about a third of the country’s total economy. Ukraine was due to cough up $7.3bn this year alone – more than its annual education budget. For a rich country blessed with peace, that would be manageable, but Ukrainians are poorer today than when the Soviet Union collapsed three decades ago. At least $100bn worth of damage has already been inflicted to infrastructure – from roads to bridges, hospitals to schools – and, as you read this, that figure only mounts. Yet almost all of the financial assistance being given to Ukraine is in the form of loans. Precious funds will be diverted from rebuilding a shattered country, instead filling the coffers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and private bondholders. That’s why Ukrainian civil society organisations have launched a petition demanding Ukraine’s debt is cancelled. They note, too, that much of the supposed assistance given to the country has been accompanied by strict conditions: the IMF calls it “economic restructuring”, but it’s more honestly described as the imposition of free-market dogma, resulting, for instance, in a 650% surge in household gas prices since 2014. “Previous governments had two options: either to fairly tax the fat cats and bring them out of the shadows, or to borrow from the IMF and others,” Ukrainian economist Oleksandr Kravchuk told me. “They chose the latter.” The Jubilee Debt Campaign has taken up this demand and begun to lobby MPs in Britain. Like millions of us, executive director Heidi Chow had that gnawing, helpless sense of “we’ve got to do something”. For some, that manifested itself in the demand for a no-fly zone. But in practice, she tells me, that’s a “shoot Russian military aircraft out of the sky” zone, which could easily escalate into nuclear war. In contrast, this is a tangible and hugely impactful proposal with no risk of military escalation. So why hasn’t this commonsense demand been taken up by the powerful? In part, perhaps, it’s because Ukraine’s own government hasn’t officially called for it, although some high-ranking officials have. “They were quite keen before the war to pay debts and push forward their standing in Europe and the world,” suggests Chow. Applying for any form of debt relief is a complicated and drawn-out process. Any fears that their ability to borrow and their global reputation may be damaged clearly need alleviating. Yet the grisly fact is that as yet more loans are granted – even though now without conditions – vast profits are to be made. Ukrainian bonds are trading at about 25 cents in a dollar, and so if repayments continue, hedge funds and banks are set to make profits of more than 300%. That the profit margins of the already obscenely rich are being inflated by the bloody slaughter of civilians should surely be a cause of universal revulsion – and sufficient impetus to action. But if the IMF and World Bank cancel Ukraine’s debt, critics may ask, doesn’t that mean less money in the pot to lend to other poorer countries? But there’s a straightforward solution: richer countries, like our own, should contribute more to make up the shortfall. There is a precedent of sorts – the G20’s debt service suspension initiative suspended or cancelled nearly $11bn of poorer countries’ external debt because of Covid-19. If a pandemic is reason enough to write off debt, surely a war of aggression is too. When this all ends – hopefully in failure for Putin – then Ukraine will need a modern-day Marshall plan, made up of grants, not a reconstruction financed by loans. In terms of the current moment, as the Jubilee Debt Campaign suggests, there should be a mechanism to automatically suspend debt repayments for countries suffering severe external shocks. Ukraine is in the midst of existential crisis – as the Ukrainian social scientist Volodymyr Ishchenko told me: “Personally, it feels like the country in which I was born may simply disappear.” A country battered and bruised by war needs space to breathe. That’s in our power: cancel the debt.

3/21/2022,"Liverpool may have been under full strength but even in defeat it was a test emphatically passed by Steve Cooper’s burgeoning Nottingham Forest side. The hosts displayed impressive defensive discipline and shape to keep Liverpool out for 78 minutes, and arguably should have had a penalty soon after conceding. They almost certainly would have been awarded a spot-kick had Ryan Yates altered his direction slightly and aimed to draw more significant contact from Alisson, the kind of trick pulled so often by Premier League forwards for the benefit of the video assistant referee. The VAR decision to rule Diogo Jota onside for the winner was also very tight. Forest caused Jürgen Klopp’s men problems and had the chances to win the match outright but a lack of ruthlessness with the opportunities they created left Cooper’s side to ponder a couple of marginal decisions that could easily have gone the other way. As Joe Worrall said, Forest went “toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world”. Plenty of positives to take from that. Luke McLaughlin Match report: Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool Manchester City v Liverpool Chelsea v Crystal Palace The ties to be played at Wembley on 16/17 April. Eberechi Eze’s fine first season at Crystal Palace was soundtracked by the fond, paternal shouts of Ray Lewington, who seemed in some games to be present purely for the purpose of in-game coaching Palace’s left-sided attacker. Hopefully Lewington had a Sunday off to shout fondly at his television screen as Eze produced a fine, bold, effective display in the 4-0 FA Cup defeat of Everton. This was significant: Eze’s second start against Premier League opponents since May 2021; an assertive showing after a season struggling with the aftershocks of an achilles injury; and more simply a reminder of what an excellent player he is, so easy on the ball, so progressive in his movement and passing. Palace have a core of high-grade attacking players. Eze against Everton was a reminder that he might just end up the best of that group. Mainly he is just a rare pleasure to watch. Barney Ronay Match report: Crystal Palace 4-0 Everton Bukayo Saka made a point of telling the referee, Robert Madley, he needed more protection after feeling he had received rough treatment during Arsenal’s win at Aston Villa, but he was given short shrift by Steven Gerrard when his concerns were fed through. “It’s part of the game,” Gerrard said. “The last time I checked, it wasn’t a no-contact sport. I think tackles are allowed, physicality is allowed. He’s a good player, an outstanding talent. I love him. But he can’t complain about that side of it, that’s football. I’m sitting here now with screws in my hips. I’ve had about 16 operations. I’m struggling to go to the gym at the moment. That’s all on the back of earning a living in English football. He’ll learn and he’ll learn quick.” In fairness to Saka, he routinely gets up, dusts himself down and carries on; Gerrard was right that Villa had done little wrong, despite rancour over a fair tackle by Tyrone Mings, and the sense was that the England forward was expressing a longer-term frustration. Nick Ames Match report: Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal Whatever madness ensued at Molineux, Wolves allowed themselves to wobble, self-destructing in the wake of Raúl Jiménez’s controversial sending off. It was a decision that stung Bruno Lage but more so his players. Wolves were chasing a third goal that would surely have put the game to bed but Leeds exposed their frailty to devastating effect and Lage was critical of his team’s mentality, accusing his players of being too concerned about the injured Stuart Dallas; they wilted under pressure. Friday night was the first time they have conceded three goals this season. “We created a lot of chances to score more goals and this is how we need to grow up, we need to kill the game,” said the Wolves head coach. “It happened against Manchester United at home [when they conceded a late winner in August] and it’s happened again. These are the little things and we need to grow up as a team.” Ben Fisher Match report: Wolves 2-3 Leeds At times it may have looked simple for Chelsea but Thomas Tuchel begged to disagree. According to the visiting manager, beating Middlesbrough 2-0 to reach the FA Cup semi finals took a “huge effort” from his players. It involved Tuchel adjusting his formation to 4-1-4-1 in order to combat Chris Wilder’s clever pressing game and, as Boro’s manager pointed out, the Championship side were never overrun by opponents who could afford to lose £900,000 a week under Roman Abramovich’s out-going ownership. If such losses explain why Chelsea’s sale may not be that straightforward they also highlight the excellence of the job Wilder has done on an infinitely tighter budget since succeeding Neil Warnock in November. After beating Manchester United and Tottenham in earlier rounds Boro can now concentrate on securing a play-off place. They and Wilder would grace the Premier League. Louise Taylor Match report: Middlesbrough 0-2 Chelsea Two years ago, Manchester City scored 10 against Ipswich Town to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. This season, in a 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to West Ham, a team that has already achieved its best-ever WSL points tally, Joe Sheehan’s team showed how far they has come. “We’re such a young squad,” said Ipswich forward Natasha Jones. “Looking back two years ago, we played Man City and they beat us 10-0. We just know we’ve done that little bit better. Look at the scoreline: we’ve played our hearts out, we’ve given everything on the pitch, so we’re really happy with that. It was a great atmosphere and great to be involved in that.” Jones works 40 hours a week as a personal trainer. An impressive 10 players are on professional contracts and the club has some of the best talent in the country. With a top-level academy licence, the signs of progress keep coming. “They’re in the middle of the WSL table and yes, there was a difference there, but we know we can keep on closing that gap.” Suzanne Wrack Match report: Ipswich 0-1 West Ham Coventry United’s fairytale journey from being within eight minutes of going into administration to reaching an FA Cup quarter-final was ended by four goals from 14-time FA Cup winners Arsenal. The resilience of Jay Bradford’s players was on show at Meadow Park as they held the Women’s Champions League quarter-finalists at bay for 38 minutes before Stina Blackstenius opened the scoring. The gap between the WSL leaders Arsenal and the Championship’s bottom side is a big one, but a sturdy first half should give Coventry plenty of positives as they look to climb off the bottom after suffering a 10-point deduction for their financial difficulties at Christmas. The team have clawed back five points since then and sit nine points behind Watford – the team they face on the last game of the season. Suzanne Wrack Match report: Arsenal 4-0 Coventry It was a surprise to see Jan Bednarek omitted from the Southampton lineup for the FA Cup visit of Manchester City – and indeed the match day squad. Had the first-choice centre-back picked up an injury? It turned out it was something else, as Ralph Hassenhüttl would explain after the 4-1 loss. “Bednarek has a big game for Poland next week and it seemed to me he is not 100% with his mind for us here today,” the manager said. “I didn’t want to take the risk that he doesn’t make the last step to hurt himself.” It is certainly a big game for Poland. Bednarek’s team will face either Sweden or the Czech Republic on Tuesday week in a play-off for the World Cup finals. Hasenhüttl did not sound overly pleased with Bednarek and maybe it was because his replacement, Jack Stephens, had an uncomfortable afternoon, making errors, including a bad one for Raheem Sterling’s opening goal. David Hytner Match report: Southampton 1-4 Manchester City After the final international break of the season, Leicester could suddenly have so much competition for places that, with three games in hand on the teams in seventh and eighth place whom they trail by nine points, they could set themselves up for a barnstorming finish in the Premier League and continue chasing glory in Europe. With PSV Eindhoven to come in the quarter-final of the Europa Conference League and Jamie Vardy, Jonny Evans, Timothy Castagne and Wes Fofana all nearing full fitness – and none of the current top four left to play in the league – Leicester could benefit from the opposite sense of momentum that cost them in the past two seasons. Peter Lansley Match report: Leicester 2-1 Brentford “You would never see West Ham being a top-four side,” said David Moyes after his team’s attempt at Champions League qualification suffered probably a terminal blow in Sunday’s 3-1 loss against Spurs. “I am a bit annoyed that I am getting asked it, but also I’m quite pleased because it’s telling me we were seen as a side that was getting seen for top four. It should be put as – how well have West Ham done to stay in the race until the last part of season.” Defeatism or realism from Moyes? Surely it was the latter: he is correct that West Ham have been punching above their weight, and his attempt to manage expectation is entirely understandable. It was also predictable that there would be a hangover from Thursday’s memorable Europa League win against Sevilla. Happily for the Hammers, they would get the best of both worlds if they can win the Europa League, booking themselves a place in next season’s Champions League via a different route. Luke McLaughlin Match report: Tottenham 3-1 West Ham",Sport/Football,Premier League and FA Cup: 10 talking points from the weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/21/premier-league-and-fa-cup-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend
3/21/2022,"Let’s start with Ange Capuozzo’s break, one step, two steps, a swerve, a curve, a burst, 10, 20, 30, 40m and more past one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine flailing Welsh defenders. You knew Capuozzo must be good just from the look of him when he came off the bench to make his debut against Scotland the previous week –a man that small and pretty must have something about him to get ahead in Test rugby – but it’s been startling to watch him this past fortnight, when he has scored two tries and set up one of the greatest, and most famous, in the history of the competition. Even in Cardiff, 400 miles away from the Stade de France and four hours before kick-off in the grand slam match, there was a French flavour to the championship. They know all about Capuozzo down in France’s second division. He qualified for Italy through his father but he was born, raised, and plays in Grenoble (for now; he is moving to Toulouse next season). In England, where the Premiership is ring‑fenced, that kind of promotion has become almost unthinkable, but in France it is not nearly so rare. Capuozzo is not the only player who has stepped up to Test rugby from the second division in recent years. France’s full-back, Melvyn Jaminet, was playing there last season, so was the man from whom he took over, Anthony Bouthier, the season before that. The scrum‑half Léo Coly, who won his France first call-up at the start of the tournament, still is. Which speaks to the strength in depth of French rugby, yes, and the open-mindedness of their coaches, but also to the way in which winning the 2023 World Cup has become a national project for the French, one that has pulled in every last one of France’s 1,900-odd clubs. It is as if the next great player could come from anywhere. On Saturday night Fabien Galthié even made a point of explicitly thanking them all for their support. He said: “We share this moment with all the French clubs, we are aware of the people who are behind us, and sharing this with them makes sense of what we do.” Right now, it feels as if France’s 23 have the weight of their nation behind them. It’s no wonder they were shoving England backwards in the scrums. There’s an irresistible momentum to French rugby, a sense that after 10 years of bickering, all the people involved in the sport – the federation, the amateur and professional clubs, the players, and the fans – are all pulling in the same direction. General De Gaulle said it was hard to govern a country that has more than 200 kinds of cheese, and the FFR president, Bernard Laporte, will tell you it’s almost as hard to manage a federation that has the best part of 2,000 amateur clubs, who all have a vote in how the game should be run. And that is before you factor in relations with the 30 professional sides in the National Rugby League, who run the Top 14, which is the most lucrative, and gruelling, league in the world. There have been times, such as the match at Twickenham in 2020 when France were forced to do without so many of their best Test players because of a row about their availability, when it has been close to impossible. For years, it felt like this jigsaw would never come together. But it has, piece by piece. It started with the Joueur Issus des Filières de Formation regulations, from 2016, just before Laporte was elected for his first term as president. They cut back the number of overseas players in the league by forcing the clubs to keep an average of at least 16 homegrown players in their squad across the season. After that, there were the negotiations over the financial compensation paid out to the clubs when they send their players for international duty. They worked out so well that, right now, France are able to name a training squad of 42 players, and hold on to 28 of them even when their clubs have matches in the fallow weeks. At the same time, there has been huge investment in their youth setup, which led to the back‑to‑back titles in the World Under-20 Championship, and their national programme, which is of course run by Laporte’s old friend Galthié. The two of them were coach and captain of the team that lost to England in the semi-finals of the 2003 World Cup and they still have each other’s backs now. When Laporte was fighting a re-election battle in 2020, Galthié said he would consider his position if he did not win the vote. In return Galthié has been given almost everything he has asked for, including what has grown into the strongest coaching unit in Test rugby. Incredible as it sounds, there was a time, not long ago, when France employed only two assistant coaches: one for the backs, one for the forwards. Now they have an army of them. Raphaël Ibañez handles the man-management and Shaun Edwards marshals the defence, Laurent Labit runs the attack, William Servat does the scrummaging and Karim Ghezal the lineouts, Vlok Cilliers oversees the kicking, the former referee Jérôme Garcès works on their discipline, and the renowned trainer Thibault Giroud does the strength and conditioning. Which means that this golden generation of young players are stepping into the best-run coaching setup in the sport. That combination put 40 points on the All Blacks in the autumn, don’t forget, and now they have won the grand slam, too, there is only one step left – the World Cup in 18 months’ time.",Sport/Sport,French rugby in perfect harmony 18 months before home World Cup | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/21/french-rugby-in-perfect-harmony-18-months-before-home-world-cup
3/21/2022,"According to Robert Pattinson, the most important accessory on the new batsuit was not the batarang, the bat lasso or the bat grapple, but a Velcro flap that allowed him to pee when needed. No such easy escape, though, for audiences of The Batman, who must display superhuman willpower and gird their loins for its 176-minute runtime. Given that it joins No Time to Die (163 minutes) and Avengers Endgame (181 minutes) in the ranks of recent blockbusters dicing with the bladder-busting three-hour limit, is it time we reinstated that staple of another era of maximalist cinema: the intermission? It feels like a relic of a more civilised epoch. But, with more franchises than ever happy to take their sweet time, the intermission would be a welcome opportunity to hit the WC, as well as loosen the legs and buttocks and avail ourselves of refreshments, while musing with fellow cinemagoers on the semantics of grunge in The Batman. Elongated runtimes have become so common that many franchises, such as Avengers, The Hobbit and It, started breaking up unified stories into multiple parts anyway – effectively enforcing months-long intermissions. So why not make it official and, once a film tops the 150-minute mark, give us all a break? However, the death of the intermission has actually been much exaggerated: it still survives in Iceland, Switzerland, Egypt, Turkey and, of course, India, where movies contain so many volcanic emotions that a break to let everyone cool off is practically a public health measure. They have made the occasional return in showcase screenings of latter-day Hollywood film, to enhance the old-timey mood – as with Peter Jackson’s King Kong (187 minutes) or Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight (187 minutes) – or simply out of mercy in the case of the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League (242 minutes). But essentially, at some point, some Hollywood analyst decided that a 10-minute hiatus was incompatible with the “pack ’em in, six shows a day” production line of the modern multiplex. Gandhi, in 1982, is often cited as the last major western film to feature an intermission. This would be fitting as this multi-Oscar-winner was a holdover – in a world leaning into the streamlined blockbuster machines ushered in by Spielberg, Lucas et al – from the old-style, sprawling epics that parted their productions midway as surely as Charlton Heston did the Red Sea. Originally, intermissions were a legacy of theatre and opera, though in early cinema they had a technical justification: giving the projectionist time to change the very big reels. But in the 1950s and 1960s they became part of the deluxe theatrical experience the studios laid on for widescreen epics such as The Ten Commandments, Lawrence of Arabia and the original West Side Story, in an effort to entice viewers back from the young pretender, TV. These behemoths were first wheeled out at “roadshow” screenings in major cities, often with the full trimmings: overtures, entr’actes and intermissions that allowed weary punters to hit the concession stalls and get a Coke to see them through another two hours of warring gangs, endless desert treks or Egyptian plagues. But 21st-century cinema now faces its own existential threat: streaming. No one’s going to pretend that bringing back intermissions would suddenly reverse the post-pandemic malaise of movie theatres in the face of Netflix, Disney+ and others. However, especially compared with the degraded home viewing experience, interrupted by social media every 30 seconds, they might help bolster the status of cinema-going as a prestige event. Over the last decade, it feels as if the movies have tried every gimmick – from 3D to Imax to immersive, Secret Cinema-type masquerades – to rejuvenate the night-out experience, but these all come at a premium. Intermissions could lend a sense of occasion and ceremony to today’s cold-eyed franchise lineup and subtly link back to a more genteel era of film-making. This would come at no extra cost – and indeed the extended pause would help boost the snack sales that already deliver the fattest profit margins. They might even help blockbusters lift their game. It’s a regular complaint of the CGI era that story – frequently retro-fitted around VFX sequences – takes second place. Under the yoke of those long runtimes, a kind of digital fatigue often sets in, where you’re suddenly unable to distinguish one muddy monster smackdown from another. If intermissions were a regular feature, it might force studios to think more about structure again – to carefully modulate the rhythm of their screenplay around the pause, and see what cliffhanger, or other dramatic effect, they could spirit up. Lawrence of Arabia, with Peter O’Toole and his Arab chums having the bit between their teeth, hits the intermission on a chastening note from Claude Rains: “He’s riding the whirlwind! Let’s hope that we’re not.” In Seven Samurai, some villagers are beginning to think they can beat the bandits without all this extra help, but Takashi Shimura takes them to task right before half-time: “This is the nature of war: by protecting others, you save yourself.” This is the intermission working smartly: as an introspective inflection point, a minor fall before the major lift. With the Snap, when Thanos seemingly irreversibly finger-clicks half the universe’s population out of existence, Marvel managed a true coup de théâtre to close Avengers: Infinity War – and what a marvellous intermission it would have made if Endgame had followed immediately. But that kind of poise feels like a rarity for their formulaic Lycra-fests. In truth, though, the return of the intermissions seems about as likely as Batman smoking a bong. But maybe, just hypothetically, we can float a gentlemen’s agreement with Hollywood: if you’re going to insist on stretching out comic-book juvenilia to Tolstoy proportions, how about doing the decent thing and letting us take our time too?",Arts/Film,Blockbuster or bladderburster?

3/21/2022,"Today’s puzzles require you to roll up your sleeves and wrestle with a square piece of paper. Because this is the best way to become brilliant at a maths. Or so concludes a recent study by developmental psychologists at Surrey, Toronto and Maryland universities. The report – a meta-analysis that combined the results of 29 separate studies involving almost 4,000 children – says that activities that train spatial reasoning like paper folding, building with blocks, and solving three-dimensional puzzles are by far the most effective way for young people to raise their maths performance. “When children learn the relationship between space and shapes through tangible physical tools such as puzzles, their mathematics performance improves,” says Dr Katie Gilligan-Lee of the University of Surrey, a co-author of the report. “We found that spatial training with physical 3D materials led to bigger gains than computer-based training or workbook activities. So physically holding, rotating, turning and combining objects with your hands is much more effective than using a mouse to do spatial computer games.” In fact, spatial reasoning training is more effective than maths mastery classes, summer school, chess clubs, getting older kids to help younger ones, and other parental and school interventions. Yet fiddling about with physical puzzles is a neglected part of educational practice and policy. Dr Gilligan-Lee thinks that increasing spatial training in the classroom could dramatically improve mathematics outcomes in the UK, which lags behind its international competitors at STEM skills. “This is particularly true given that people find spatial activities and puzzles to be engaging, fun, and importantly they are perceived to be non-academic.” Now to today’s tasks. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. There is something incredibly satisfying about connecting directly with an object, unmediated by writing on paper or thinking in abstractions. Note: For all the puzzles you require a square sheet of paper. For the final puzzles you may require a hole punch or sharp object. 1. The triangle fold Fold a square paper in such a way that fold lines (and possibly an edge) mark an equilateral triangle. (Compass and ruler not allowed!) 2. The 3D shape Can you fold a square sheet of paper so that it makes a closed 3D shape, with no overlaps, gaps or extraneous flaps of paper? You cannot, for example, fold the square to make a cube since you will create an overlap or extra flaps. Hole punch puzzles For each of the next puzzles, you must take a square piece of paper and fold it, using as many folds as is needed, so that if you punch a single hole through the folded paper you will match the image when the paper is fully unfolded. 3. The X 4. The diagonal 5. The ring 6. A hole punch in the head I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. Please discuss your favourite physical puzzles below the line.

3/21/2022,"Women would be as much as $118,000 better off in retirement if subsidies were increased to make childcare more affordable, according to new research by Industry Super Australia (ISA). ISA said the move would help close the gap between men and women, who retire with an average of a third less super than men because of time spent out of the workforce with children, and boost Australia’s total superannuation savings by $35bn by 2050. Until recently, the government subsidised up to 85% of childcare costs for lower income households, but the payment declines at the steep rate of one percentage point for every $3,000 a family earns over $70,000 a year. According to research by the Grattan Institute, this dramatic fall in the subsidy discourages women with small children from working more than three days a week. For ISA’s new report, accounting firm Deloitte modelled the effect of boosting the childcare subsidy from 85% to 95% for low-income households and flattening the taper rate at which it is reduced as income rises. Deloitte’s modelling found that a woman earning the median wage would have $118,000 more in super by retirement if the changes allowed her to work five days a week rather than two. A woman in the same situation who was part of a low-income couple would be $69,000 better off. The change would also reduce dependence on pensions and increase the income tax take by $2.1bn a year by 2050, according to the report. “Making childcare more affordable will boost retirement savings, slash the gender super gap and drive down future pension costs,” said ISA’s director of advocacy, Georgia Brumby. “More affordable childcare combined with paying super on parental leave will make sure mums are not left behind when they have children,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report is the second in a series by ISA tackling the retirement income gap. Last year it recommended paying super on parental leave. ISA said there was still much work to be done, with many other factors contributing to women leaving the workforce with less in super than men. These include lower participation in the workforce by women than men, lower pay in female-dominated industries, the gender pay gap, employers that won’t give flexibility to accommodate caring responsibility, discrimination in hiring and pay rise decisions and women being expected to do unpaid caring work. Additional drivers will be examined in future reports, ISA said.",News/Australia news,"More affordable childcare would boost women’s retirement savings, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/more-affordable-childcare-would-boost-womens-retirement-savings-report-says
3/21/2022,"Universities must stop accepting funding from fossil fuel companies to conduct climate research, even if the research is aimed at developing green and low-carbon technology, an influential group of distinguished academics has said. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, the Nasa data scientist Peter Kalmus, and prominent US climate scientist Michael Mann are among close to 500 academics from the US and the UK who have written an open letter addressed to all university leaders in the two countries, calling on them to reject all funding from fossil fuel companies. Accepting money from fossil fuel companies represented “an inherent conflict of interest” and could “taint” essential research and “compromise” academic freedom, they wrote. For the companies, it was a chance to “greenwash” their reputations and skew the findings of research in a way favourable to them. The letter draws a comparison to the tobacco industry and its disinformation campaigns, noting that numerous public heath and research institutions reject tobacco funding for these reasons and calling on fossil fuel cash to be treated similarly. “Universities and the research they produce are vital to delivering a rapid, just transition away from fossil fuels. However, such efforts are undermined by fossil fuel industry funding. Academics should not be forced to choose between researching climate solutions and inadvertently aiding corporate greenwashing,” the signatories wrote. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, told the Guardian: “This sort of funding has been used to compromise leading academic institutions. It’s a two-for for polluters: they purchase the imprimatur of these institutions and their presumed authority and objectivity, while funding research that often translates into advocacy for false solutions and ‘kick the can down the road’ prescriptions like massive carbon capture, which is unproven at scale, and geoengineering, which is downright dangerous. That is entirely the wrong path forward.” Genevieve Guenther, founder and director of the End Climate Silence campaign, and an affiliate at the New School university in New York, said: “Funding research enables oil and gas companies to ground their promotional statements in enough truth to give substance to the green shadows in which they hide their most polluting and deadly activities. We must remove fossil-energy interests from our institutions so that our children can have a chance at a liveable future.” Universities have been under pressure from their students and some academics for several years to divest their investments, such as pension funds and endowments, away from fossil fuels, and many have done so. However, this is the first major call from senior academics for them to go further and cut all research ties with fossil fuel companies. There is no clear estimate for how much money universities accept from fossil fuel companies, as most do not publish their sources. An investigation for the Observer last year found UK universities alone had taken at least £89m from oil companies in the previous four years. Some scientists disagree with the letter. James Hansen, former chief scientist at Nasa and one of the first scientists to warn governments of the impending climate crisis, told the Guardian: “It’s the wrong focus, causing young people to waste their energy on unproductive activities, while they actually have the potential to lead a solution.” Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said it was reasonable for universities to accept funding from fossil fuel companies if those businesses showed genuine commitment to transforming themselves. “Fossil fuel companies that are genuinely committed to the transition [to a low-carbon economy], including net zero emissions, can and should receive help from university researchers, particularly with the development of technologies for carbon capture and storage, renewables and emissions reductions. However, universities should be careful about accepting funding directly or indirectly from oil, gas and coal companies that are not genuinely committed to the clean energy transition and which are attempting to greenwash their reputations.” A spokesperson for Imperial College London, which the Observer found last year had accepted £54m from oil companies since 2017, said: “Decarbonisation is our top priority when working with energy companies. This goal requires a radical shift in industrial systems, technologies and business models in the energy sector. We are using our influence and expertise to accelerate this transition and actively engage with energy companies to push them to meet the Paris Agreement targets. We will monitor progress and only continue to work with companies who demonstrate commitment and credible action to achieving these targets.” Some academics argue that fossil fuel funding is needed to develop the technologies necessary for a low-carbon economy, and that if western universities reject such funding it will be accepted in other countries around the world. Guenther disagreed: “It’s a myth that fossil-energy companies are spending large sums to aid the green transition. According to the IEA’s 2021 World Energy Investment report, a mere 1% of fossil-energy companies’ capital expenditure is devoted to research, development or deployment of technologies that either abate or do not produce greenhouse gas emissions.” At the end of this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish the third part of its comprehensive review of climate science, examining the potential ways of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This will include technology such as renewable energy and nuclear power, and novel ideas such as sucking carbon dioxide out of the air. The report will throw the spotlight on the potential technological solutions to the climate crisis, which will require tens or hundreds of billions of pounds in funding to be brought to market and deployed widely around the world. Jason Hickel, an economic anthropologist who is signatory to the letter, said the funding should come from governments. “The US and UK are among the richest countries on Earth, and their governments enjoy total monetary sovereignty. They have the capacity to finance the necessary research many times over, at the touch of a button. Most of the major innovations and public projects that have changed history over the past century have relied on public funding for research,” said Hickel, who is professor of environmental science at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a fellow of the LSE. The letter did not specify whether companies with interests in fossil fuels amid a broader portfolio should be included in the ban. Ilana Cohen, a Harvard student who led the organisation of the letter, said it was directed at the top 200 fossil fuel companies. Cohen said the organisers had confined the call to US and UK universities for now as these are where many fossil fuel companies are concentrating their funding, but that it could be widened in future to a global effort.",News/Science,"Universities must reject fossil fuel cash for climate research, say academics",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/21/universities-must-reject-fossil-fuel-cash-for-climate-research-say-academics
3/21/2022,"When you have faulty goods or receive poor service, it can be really hard to get redress. Companies fob you off, you don’t know your rights or you get sent from pillar to post. Follow these tips to get what you deserve. Always put your complaint in writing. Email is easiest but you can also send it by post. The risk of being pushed from pillar to post is reduced, and you won’t have to repeat yourself if you need to contact the company again because it will have the details on record. You can keep rewriting before clicking the send button on an email so the risk of losing your temper is reduced and you can make sure you haven’t forgotten anything. Most importantly, though, you have a record of what has been said and when it was said. You may need to take the matter further, for instance, by going to an alternative dispute resolution provider (usually an ombudsman) or making a claim through the small claims court. Phone calls will not give you the evidence you will need if you pursue these avenues. If the company has made it difficult for you to contact it, get the email address of the chief executive; you can do this for free at ceoemail.com. The chief executive may not respond personally (although some do) but your message should escalate the matter and get your complaint noticed and dealt with. Before you raise a complaint, check that you are being objective and that there are grounds for a formal complaint. Complaining about a sales assistant’s clothing would be subjective and inappropriate. But if the assistant threw down and damaged the item you were collecting, complaining about that would be reasonable. However frustrated you may feel, ranting to customer services will not help. You are far more likely to succeed by remaining polite and non-threatening. You do not need to be able to quote lots of legalese but demonstrating that you know your rights means you are less likely to be fobbed off. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, you are entitled to goods that are free from defects, of satisfactory quality, match the description and last a reasonable length of time. When you are paying for services, they must be carried out with reasonable skill and care. If your item turns out to be in breach of any of the act within 30 days from purchase, you are entitled to a full refund. After this time you can receive a replacement or repair. Within the first 30 days you will need to prove the problem was there at the point of purchase. But in reality this is rarely questioned. You need a proof of purchase, which doesn’t have to be a receipt. A bank or loyalty card statement would also work as proof. If your purchase breaches any of the CRA requirements, then if you have to send back the item the trader is liable for the postage costs. Contrary to popular belief, you are not entitled to a full refund because you changed your mind. However, the law is different for purchases bought online. Under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, you have a 14-day cooling-off period from when you receive them. Your contract is always with the company to which you paid the money. So, if your parcel is late or lost, do not contact the courier to complain; contact the retailer instead. For late items, you are entitled to a refund of any extra costs you paid as a result of the lateness. If the courier damages anything, including your property, it is still the retailer who is responsible for putting the matter right, so address your complaints to it. Give the company a timescale by which it has to respond. With an email, five working days is fine as there is no need to factor in time for your complaint to arrive. For letters, you may need to give a little longer. It may be that the company needs longer to investigate. However, it should get back to you before the deadline to tell you when you can expect to hear from it again. A good sentence to end your email with is: “Should I not receive a satisfactory response I will not hesitate in taking the matter further. This will include but not be limited to …” This could be sharing your experience on social media and various forums or engaging with an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider or the small claims court. As soon as any deadline has passed, if you have not had a response send a follow-up email outlining further action you will be taking. Companies often say that the most difficult thing about dealing with complaints is not knowing what the customer wants them to do to put things right. Make it easy for people to understand what you want and how to give it to you by stating what it is in your letter. Is it a full refund? A repair? An apology? An explanation for poor service? Whatever it is, be clear in your request. Thinking about this will also help you to decide whether you are satisfied with any remedy you are offered. If you do not receive a satisfactory response you have a couple of choices. If the company you are complaining to is a member of an ADR scheme, you can take your complaint to the relevant provider. Some schemes are mandatory for certain sectors such as telecoms (Communication Ombudsman or CISAS, the Communication & Internet Services Adjudication Scheme), energy (Energy Ombudsman) and finance (Financial Ombudsman Service). Non-statutory schemes (so traders do not have to join) include the Motor Ombudsman, whose members include vehicle manufacturers, warranty product providers, franchised dealers, independent garages, networks and bodyshops. The Dispute Resolution Ombudsman runs the Furniture & Home Improvement Ombudsman and the Rail Ombudsman. All the schemes are listed on the website of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. You can take your issue to the relevant body eight weeks after you first complained or once you have received a deadlock letter from the company. The company is bound by its decision, whereas you are not. If the company is not a member of an ADR scheme or you don’t like the decision, then the small claims court is an option. To show the company you are serious in your intention, send a “letter/email before action” outlining that you intend to take it to court. List the costs, including the court fees. Go to the small claims court websites for England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, fill out everything, right up to payment, take a screenshot and attach it to an email to the chief executive.",Lifestyle/Money,How to complain effectively – and get results,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/21/how-complain-effectively-get-results-clear-informed-reasonable
3/21/2022,"To say this unmissable, deeply depressing book – about exactly how Britain pimps itself to the world’s dirtiest money – is timely is to miss author Oliver Bullough’s point. The fact is the stories that he tells, sordid tales of a nation flogging its real estate and its services and its football clubs and its good name to the shadiest and highest bidder, no questions asked, have been hiding in plain sight for decades. It has just seemed in no government’s interest to notice them. Bullough himself has long been shouting from the bullet-proof penthouses about these tales. Alongside his 2018 book Moneyland – a quest into that Narnia of libel laws and tax havens and old-school-tie discretion that makes London so attractive to extortionists – he organised “kleptocrat tours” of the capital, his equivalent of Hollywood Hills rubber-necking, bus trips around Knightsbridge and Mayfair pointing out the mansions where the cronies of the world’s worst dictators and biggest tax dodgers hide their billions. It took even Bullough a while, though, to nail the exact bent-double relationship that many among the elite of this country’s lawmakers and bankers and lawyers and accountants have adopted toward this global kleptocracy. The rouble dropped when he was approached by an American academic and asked to explain what the British government did to protect the nation against money laundering. Which agencies had the most teeth, which prosecutors won the most cases, which politicians were most vocal, where could he find the paper trails? Bullough had to explain that unlike in the United States, where there were well-funded federal bureaux and tenacious homeland security investigators and high-profile cases of launderers brought to justice, in Britain there were very few of these things. Eventually, in response to his interlocutor’s bafflement, he blurted: “We’re not a policeman, like you guys, we’re a butler, the butler to the world… If someone is rich, whether they are Chinese or Russian or whatever, and they need something done, or something hidden, or something bought, then Britain sorts that out for them… – that’s what a butler does.” The American asked him another question: “How long has this been going on?” and Bullough again found himself answering without hesitation: “It started in the 1950s. We needed a new business model after America took over as the world’s superpower, and this is what we found.” He dates the shift to the Suez crisis in 1956, the year that Britain’s imperial apparatus finally collapsed, and the establishment cast around for another source of wealth to keep it in the style to which it had long become accustomed. The philosophy of the new venture went by the name of “light touch regulation”. The unmatched financial and legal infrastructure that had allowed the UK to conquer a quarter of the world was quietly repurposed to do the bidding of individuals from dubious regimes that it had sometimes fostered, and others who had seized control of their nation’s resources and needed a place to hide what they creamed off. Bullough begins by showing how old colonialists found a new niche in recreating the further-flung outposts of empire – the self-governing protectorates of the British Virgin Islands, the Caymans, Gibraltar – as looters’ havens. They used crafty expertise to create the small print of shell companies and financial instruments that allowed multimillionaires and global corporations to avoid doing the thing they liked least – pay taxes. Successive UK governments, while occasionally handwringing about closing those loopholes, were, he shows, complicit in this practice, working on that time-honoured imperial principle: well, if we don’t do it, someone else will. Over time our biggest growth industry, the new source of the City’s wealth and power, was as 10% fixers for fraudsters and worse. “In Britain,” Bullough argues, “butlering is almost invariably regarded as a source of jobs and wealth because it is seen from the butler’s perspective rather than that of their clients’ or their victims’… It makes a good comedy when Jeeves outsmarts the village bobby or Bertie Wooster gets away with a scam because his chum is the local magistrate, but this is not the way to run a financial system.” Inevitably, several of the minutely researched case studies he analyses involve Russia and Ukraine. One of the most bleakly instructive is the Ministry of Defence’s decision, in 2014, to sell for £53m the former London Underground station at Brompton Road near Harrods to a man named Dmitry Firtash, whom the US government had been seeking to extradite on racketeering charges. Firtash had made his billions as a middleman between the Kremlin and the Russian oil giant Gazprom, and has consistently been forced to deny association with the FBI’s most-wanted Ukrainian-born mobster Semyon Mogilevich. In Britain, however, with the cross-bench assistance of MPs he had set up the British Ukrainian Society in 2007 and given £6m to Cambridge University to fund a course in Ukrainian studies. After the invasion of Crimea he was invited in to advise the Foreign Office. “I tried to persuade them that imposing sanctions against Russia was a bad idea,” he told a Russian news agency. In this context, and in the context of many other stories that Bullough tells, Boris Johnson’s determination to delay the report of the intelligence and security committee into compromising Russian activity in the UK, and then dismiss it as the work of “Islington Remainers”, looks ever more alarming. The report highlighted, Bullough quotes, how “the inherent tension between the government’s prosperity agenda and the need to protect national security has been played out across Whitehall departments…” We are, partly as a result of Bullough’s digging, likely to hear a good deal more about that “prosperity agenda” in the coming months and years.

3/21/2022,"Kiri Pritchard-McLean made her name with consciousness-raising comedy drawing on her own experiences – of sexism in the comedy industry, of volunteering with disadvantaged kids. Her latest, Home Truths, is a less campaigning affair, about her relationship with, and return to, her native Wales. There’s some terrific stuff here, but I did miss the purposefulness of those previous offerings, that potent mix of personal insight and political edge. A pivot to social commentary – Pritchard-McLean latterly addresses anti-racism and transgender rights – doesn’t quite fill the gap. The show is at its best when its chronicle of our host’s life in north Wales dovetails with an account of that country’s vexed cultural politics. On the one hand, we learn about Pritchard-McLean’s contested claim on Welshness, because she didn’t grow up speaking the language. On the other, she tells us about “the Welsh knot”, by which generations of children were beaten out of their linguistic patrimony – and (there’s a funny punchline to this one) the relative seniority of the Welsh flag and poo emojis. She’s interesting, too, on the symmetries between the forces that first repelled her from, then attracted her back to, Anglesey. Before we get there, there’s backstory, about the 35-year-old’s childhood, bullied – for opposite reasons – at her private primary and state secondary schools. There is also, in a show that’s 20 minutes too long, extraneous material about her experiences in sex-ed and home economics class, and a few routines too many about how fat she supposedly is. The last of these is co-opted to make the point, at the end of a section on racism and “the trans debate” (a phrase she hates), about how hard it is to look at ourselves in the mirror – but how necessary, in a country with a skewed sense of its own moral probity. This routine, lacking the flavour of lived experience that characterised her earlier campaigning comedy, can feel sermonising, and its arguments tendentious. I left respecting Pritchard-McLean’s call-to-arms on behalf of Britain’s abused minorities – among whose number her own people recently counted – while regretting how crudely it’s grafted on to the comedy.

3/21/2022,"Kenneth Branagh has ventured bravely into contested territory with this deeply personal film, set at the outbreak of the Troubles in the city of his birth. So divisions are inevitable, with those who deplore it as a travesty of political reality ranged against others who recognise their own stories in it, or simply like it for what it is: a portrait of an ordinary childhood upended by extraordinary communal violence. There’s no pretence here to offer a political overview. Part of the film’s strength is the way it holds the focus at the level of a small boy’s understanding, so the betrayals seem inexplicable, the threat only ever half seen. As long as nine-year-old Buddy (played by Jude Hill) can go to the cinema with his granny to see thrilling new technicolour releases – which cast a romantic glow over his imagination that resists the sombre palette of the film itself – everything is more or less right in his world. This is how childhood is; it’s how children have always been able to survive the most terrible circumstances. If Jamie Dornan and Caitríona Balfe seem implausibly glamorous, it’s because that’s how Buddy sees them; if Ciarán Hinds’s roguish Pop seems impossibly erudite, it’s because anyone who can do maths homework seems like a genius to a small child who can’t. Branagh knew he was opening himself up to charges of sentimentality, and reviewers have duly obliged, but it’s a lazy position. The film is not about blue remembered hills but grey remembered streets: in its palette, its pacing and the rigour of its perspective, it earns the emotion it calls from us. It might big up the quaint values of working-class family and community, unfashionably pitting old-fashioned neighbourhood policing against the growing lawlessness of the street in one comic scene of Buddy getting his comeuppance. But there’s a bigger reality, written across the clenched, scored face of Judi Dench’s Granny, or overheard through the parentheses of doors and windows in snippets of adult conversation (“The police won’t protect us. We have to do it ourselves”). In 98 tightly edited minutes (beautifully shot by Haris Zambarloukos) it reveals a depressed, monochrome city, where the women struggle to put chips on the table, and the men are forced overseas to find work; where a spittle-flecked preacher showers vitriol on the heads of his congregation; where neighbours who look out for a small boy are quick to crab about his mother, and there’s no future for friendship between children from different faiths. Above all it’s a film about migration: about all that is lost when political circumstances make home impossible. “When we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind,” wrote the Pakistani novelist Mohsin Hamid, of another continent in another era. Buddy and his parents leave Pop in the cemetery and Granny standing alone in the street muttering, “Go, and don’t look back.” It’s sad, for sure, but through the strength of its performances, its eye for the pratfalls of childhood, its grasp of the tragic absurdity of communal strife, it avoids being simply sentimental. At this new moment of loss and mass displacement, Belfast deserves to be taken very seriously indeed.",Arts/Film,Why Belfast should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/21/why-belfast-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/21/2022,"Only a vibrant, rebellious town like Marseille could do it: stand up to bourgeois Lyon, Bordeaux and even Paris, the established gourmet destinations, and imagine a new and different French menu, one that fits our time and forges a path forward. This southern port city is a lot cheaper and sunnier than Paris, but until recently had no fine dining scene – all the good food was eaten at home or in a pizzeria. But over the past five to 10 years, lots of young cooks with diverse food heritages have moved to Marseille to open restaurants and create something new. Local, traditional chefs reacted to the “invasion” and gentrification by reaffirming their approach, with a newfound quality and creativity. Combine the energy of the new chefs with the passion and knowledge of the more traditional ones, and suddenly there is much better food all across town. In Marseille, most of us are migrants, and here, more than anywhere else in France, food is memory, power, and freedom of speech – an easy way to create connections between us all. Now, Michelin is finally showering stars across the city, on Alexandre Mazzia (born in Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Coline Faulquier (from Burgundy) at Restaurant Signature. And rightly so. But most of the city’s gems remain off the guides’ radars, and are inexpensive. Affordable, creative and inclusive, with influences from all corners of the world and many thriving female chefs – that is Marseille’s incredible food scene, and the culinary future of France. I spent the past two years eating my way across my home town to meet the pioneers of this delicious revolution, and wrote a book about it: Marseille Cuisine Le Monde. Here, I invite some of them to your table. Lilian grew up in a lakeside village near Zürich, came to Marseille in 2017 and chose to open her fish and vegetarian restaurant Limmat where no Marseillais would have dared: on the steep steps running from Cours Julien towards Noailles. “I like Marseille for its diversity, joyous atmosphere, laid-back people, rich culture and history, and I adore the sea, the sun, the sky, the light,” she says. “The food scene here is blooming! The cuisine is young, more and more political, committed to sustainability, and I really enjoy the fact that we are many female chefs.” One of her favourite spots is Brûlerie Möka, for “high-quality coffee de terroir with a conscience, a cosy atmosphere and a passionate team”. Marseille is where coffee first arrived in France, and here barista Iris Michalon has created an ethical and sustainable coffee place next to her roastery in the Boulevard Chave area. Lilian also likes La Fabriquerie in Saint-Victor, next to Les Catalans beach. “Two chefs and a sommelier prepare the best picnic to take away.” Hugues moved from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to a suburb of Paris at the age of nine, later attending a French culinary school and training in Michelin-star restaurants. His first restaurant in Marseille was in the Noailles district, AKA the “belly of Marseille”, which he moved to the glamorous Maison Montgrand hotel, though he is about to leave there. Hugues’s unique style is French mixed with his Congolese roots and inspired by his ongoing research into west African dishes and ingredients. Recently, Hugues and his wife, Mathilde, opened Libala, an African street-food canteen where gourmets stop for dishes such as sweet potato waffles with cumin, or pulled beef on brioche with coriander. “Marseille is like a village and we love that,” says Hugues. “It’s perfect for a young couple with a baby and lots of projects. The surrounding energy makes you think everything is possible.” They like to shop at Tam-Ky, a cult Asian-African grocery in the town centre run by 10 Vietnamese siblings with strong Marseille accents. The family arrived in France in 1979 and the children grew up in the earthy northern districts of Marseille. “It’s our favourite food shop,” says Hugues, “where we buy all the ingredients from my childhood. Try the niébé beans. We cook our falafels with them at Libala.” They also recommend Oh Faon!, “a new adventure in cake-land”. There, Jérôme Raffaelli and Kevin Yau wanted to create vegan pastries that everybody would crave, and they succeeded. “Try their sticky mango cake, made with coconut mousse, mochi, mango puree and coconut crumble.” “I love this agitated and colourful harbour because it’s a true Mediterranean city,” says Marie Dijon, one of Marseille’s homegrown, up-and-coming talents. After working in several trendy kitchens around town, she opened her own spot, Caterine, mid-pandemic with two girlfriends. It’s near the new foodie street, Boulevard Chave, where she grew up. To ensure that the fantastic food is affordable, they spend money only on ingredients and kitchen staff – there are no waiting staff. You order food at the counter, pick it up when it’s ready, eat, and then clean your table. But the mix of flavours in your mouth is insane. Marie’s values are shared by other female chefs in the city, such as Laëtitia Visse at meat-focused restaurant La Femme du Boucher, Noémie Lebocey at Les Eaux de Mars, Sarah Chougnet-Strudel at Regain and Charlotte Baldaquin at Les Grandes Tables de la Criee. They all adhere to sustainable practices, zero waste, and sourcing from local urban farms – which all have a social impact in Marseille. And they have no problem shaking up their grandmothers’ recipes. “Marseille’s culinary scene was really behind until new chefs with an identity as strong as the city chose to come here,” says Marie. Her top tip: “Sunday in Les Goudes [a seaside neighbourhood near the Calanques] is a must-do. Go early by bus, bike or boat, but don’t drive. Walk to Cap Croisette, “the end of the world”, swim, stare at the beautiful scenery and Maïre island, and then go eat fresh fish at L’Auberge du Corsaire Chez Paul, where tables are spread on the little old harbour. Book your table ahead, and be patient. For more fish options, try Le Grand Bar des Goudes, Restaurant Tabi on the city coast road, or Chez Madie – Les Galinettes at the Old Port. Marseille hosts a couscous festival, Kouss-Kouss, in late August each year, when dozens of restaurants create a special couscous for the occasion, whether their usual cuisine is north African or not. The best couscous in Marseille, though, is at Le Femina chez Kachetel. Founded by a family of Algerian berbers from the Kabylia region, it celebrated its 100-year anniversary last year. It’s right in the middle of Noailles, and Mustapha knows everything and everyone. His couscous stands out because it is made with barley, not wheat. Mustapha recommends Pastels World: “In Noailles we all talk a lot, including with the newcomers like L’Idéal and La Mercerie. When someone opens a restaurant, they come to eat here or I go to eat at theirs. These new restaurateurs have developed Noailles’ potential and are attracting a wider clientele to our streets. Among them are a very nice, hard-working young couple, Sonia and Raphaël, who cook Senegalese pastels – half-moon pastries filled with spiced fish or meat.” Lebanese chef Najla trained as a film director; her husband Serje Banna is a chatty Armenian-Lebanese former DJ who now does front of house. They moved here from Beirut seven years ago. “Marseille is like a mirror image of Beirut on the other side of the Med,” says Najla. “It has a piece of everybody’s home, and the word ‘tranquille’ [chill], used all day by the Marseillais, sums it up. It’s a city that haunts you, sticks to your skin and heart. You either love it or you hate it.” Najla’s cuisine at Mouné is a modern take on flamboyant Lebanese food culture, Ottolenghi style. Located between rue Sainte and rue Vauban, it’s perfect for a night out, with post-dinner drinks at nearby Bar Gaspard. The couple recommend La Poissonnerie du Golfe, the oldest fish shop in town, where they source all the fish for their restaurant. “It’s tiny, smaller than your living room, and owned by two female fishmongers, Laurence Ciccarelli and her niece, Justine. The fish and seafood are super-fresh, seasonal and tasty. Try their oysters and sea urchins, or things you’ve never eaten before.”",Lifestyle/Travel,Mouthwatering Marseille: a taste of France’s f revolution,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/21/mouthwatering-marseille-france-culinary-revolution
3/21/2022,"The first song I remember hearingCan’t Buy Me Love by the Beatles. My brother and sister are a lot older than me – 17 years – and my brother was a massive Beatles fan, so I grew up in the 80s to a lot of 60s and 70s music. I remember finding the video to Yellow Submarine very scary. The first single I boughtChris Evans had a competition when he was still a local DJ on BBC Radio London in the early 90s, where you had to phone up and answer some sort of stupid question. I won a copy of Opposites Attract by Paula Abdul on 7in single, and they posted it to me. The song that’s my karaoke go-toI did The Beautiful Ones by Prince for the pilot of Lip Sync Battle on Channel 5, which was a bit niche. I was at Prince’s last ever London concert at Koko in London. I’m a big fan. The song I inexplicably know every lyric toCareless Whisper by George Michael. He grew up in the same part of north London as me, so I’d often drive past his house. His dad used to own a Greek restaurant in Edgware. The best song to play at a partyWhen I was young, you’d always hear Slam by Onyx. If people don’t dance to that, it’s not a party. The last song I streamedI’ve recently got into Ozzy Osbourne, so The Wizard by Black Sabbath. People think he’s a bit weird, but that’s thanks to nearly wiping out his immune system with copious amounts of drugs. Why else would you bite the heads off of bats and doves at record company meetings? So – interesting fellow. The song I secretly like but tell everyone I hateWhen Will I Be Famous? by Bros. You’d never admit to that publicly. All the girls fancied them at school, but that recent Bros documentary was like Spinal Tap mixed with The Office. The best song to have sex toRocket Man by Elton John. It says so many things about the sexual act itself. It’s quite short, though, so you might have to put it on repeat! The song I wish I’d writtenAll I Want for Christmas by Mariah Carey. I worked for Mariah Carey when I was doing my media degree. One of my mates from uni got me a job at Wembley and I ended up taking her bags to the car. Then years later, I sold out the same venue. The song I can’t help singingBohemian Rhapsody by Queen.

3/21/2022,"Mary Dickins had been a spectator at poetry nights before and knew “the poetry clap”. She mimes a polite tapping of fingers. But when she made her debut as a performer at the age of 62 at the legendary Bang Said the Gun night in south London, “it was so anarchic and wild – like nothing I had seen before”. The audience stamped feet, shook shakers. “It felt transformative. I thought: ‘I’ve got to have more of this.’” Even though Dickins says she “constantly has impostor syndrome – I always feel that I’m going to be found out”, becoming a performance poet has given her a place on a stage of her own making. All her life she has written, mostly without being seen or heard. Her mother died when she was nine, and, after she went into a care home at 13, Dickins’ writing “stayed in notebooks”. “Never really took it anywhere,” she says (she has a habit of eliding the personal pronoun, as if she might be an impostor in her own sentences). But really, she says, a lot of her adult life has been about getting over childhood shyness. At university in north London – she studied education – she met her husband of 40 years, but in three years of seminars she did not utter a word. Some of this is a legacy of her years at a children’s home in Kent, she says. “It gave me a sense of what it’s like to be othered.” And it exacerbated her sense that she “never fitted in anywhere. There was always something different about me.” Dickins left that home, The Hollies, at 16, went briefly to art school and then embarked on what she calls her “chequered career”. For 10 years she travelled, from the Isles of Scilly to Israel, working as she went. “Restaurants, chambermaid in hotels, pickle factory, biscuit factory … I was a kind of vagabond,” she says. In her mid-20s, she returned to England to start her degree. “I thought it was time to start being sensible,” she says. After she graduated, she discovered that she loved working with people with learning disabilities. She became an expert – or, as she puts it, a “so-called expert” – in inclusive education. “That was my niche,” she says. She published books, and returned to the University of North London as a senior lecturer in early childhood studies. Even when her two children were young, she kept writing. “You can be cleaning the toilet and writing in your head,” she says. She joined local writing groups, and attended an Arvon course on comedy and poetry. Since her debut at Bang Said the Gun, Dickins, 72, has been a finalist in the Poetry Rivals National Slam, published a volume of verse, Happiness FM, and guested at the Poetry Takeaway van. Although she came back to England to be sensible, Dickins now sees that in adulthood she has been “giving myself permission to be silly. The sillier I allow myself to be, the better the writing is.” Her observations are humorous and poignant. “Words can be very soothing,” she says. “Putting things into words and giving your emotions shape is an important part of coming to terms with the things that happen in life.” Recently Dickins has acquired a different perspective on her heritage. Her parents moved to London from India in 1948, and she thinks her sense of injustice was already there in the family house: “There was a lot of mixed heritage that was not acknowledged.” When she was five, she discovered a portrait hidden in a wardrobe, but her mother took it away. Only when a cousin circulated photographs 15 years ago did Dickins realise that the dark-skinned man she had taken for a servant was her grandfather, “a tremendous man”, chess grandmaster, army captain and surgeon who ran free clinics. “I thought: ‘I know who I am now. I get so much from this guy that I’ve not been allowed to know about.” Does she still feel like an outsider? “I think I’ve made it into a virtue. I celebrate the fact that I don’t fit into a box. Finally! Have to wait till you’re 72 to feel confident!” she says. “But I have a sense of who I am and I’m proud of it. I wouldn’t be anyone else now – and it took me a long time to say that.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I became a performance poet at 62 – and finally I have a sense of who I am’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/21/a-new-start-after-60-i-became-a-performance-poet-at-62-and-finally-i-have-a-sense-of-who-i-am
3/21/2022,"“Are the bunkers in Albania still working?” my 11-year-old asked on hearing the news that Russia had invaded Ukraine. “Some,” I said. “Why?” “In case there is a war in Europe, and we need to find shelter,” he replied. I was his age one of the last times we “practised war” at school. At that time, all the bunkers worked, not only some – indeed they were one of the few things to still “work” in communist Albania. Once or twice a year an alarm would ring and we would rush out of our classrooms into the nearest shelter: a long, dark, underground tunnel that, legend had it, stretched all the way to the border with Yugoslavia – though nobody dared to venture more than a couple of hundred metres inside. When the cold war was over, the hundreds of thousands of bunkers built to allegedly protect people from the threat of nuclear war acquired a variety of new uses: from toilets in the wild to habitats for bats, from underground cafes to secret sites for lovers. It was a powerful symbol that the conflict between what we in Albania called the “imperialist west” and the “revisionist east” was now consigned to the past. When I was growing up, the perpetual threat of war was the condition for securing a perpetual peace at home: the kind of peace in which all dissent is suppressed and people have little choice but to comply. Over the course of the 20th century, my country progressively cut ties with the rest of the world. The more isolated it became, the more paranoid its political elites grew, the tighter their grip became on those who dared to disagree. This experience has been on my mind as I followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; I have become somewhat sceptical of the view that an extensive range of sanctions, which cuts off Russians from the rest of the world, will serve to delegitimise the Kremlin in their eyes. It has been impossible to not think about our own “war practice” as I’ve watched the chilling images of innocent Ukrainian citizens crowded in bunkers of the past, sheltering from bombs that must have seemed like an abstract, immaterial threat until they were not. Like us, they are the chess pieces in a fatal game of great power politics. But only some will be fortunate enough to survive until the next round. For many, the end of hostilities will be akin to the kind of peace mentioned by the philosopher Immanuel Kant in Toward Perpetual Peace, one of the most famous anti-war texts of the European Enlightenment: the perpetual peace of the graveyard. Written in 1795, at the height of the French revolutionary wars, Kant’s essay was heavily influenced by the French author Charles-Irénée Castel, abbé de Saint-Pierre. In 1712, shortly before the treaty of Utrecht, which inaugurated the era of great power politics that is alas still very much with us, Saint-Pierre advocated the creation of a European union of states that would include Russia. Both Saint-Pierre and Kant knew that a politics based on the balance of powers would never be able to produce a lasting peace. Future trade wars, civil wars and wars between states could hardly be avoided without the guarantee of a genuinely inclusive federation of states, where “the weakest would have enough security that the most powerful of the great powers would be unable to harm them”. The world might have looked very different if those projects had been pursued. Today, confronted by the realities of contemporary Europe, where Germany has decided to reverse a decades-long defence policy to ramp up its military spending, where Sweden and Finland contemplate accelerated accession to Nato, and where the prospect of nuclear war haunts even an 11-year-old born in London, they have a distinctively utopian ring. Where does one find hope? One misleading way to think about hope is as an attitude that sits somewhere between a desire and belief: a desire for a certain outcome and a belief that the outcome will be favourable. In that sense, to be hopeful means to observe the world and find evidence that the course of events supports a generally optimistic outlook. But when confronted with the brutality and destruction of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, it is difficult not to conclude, as Tolstoy does in War and Peace, that “the higher the human intellect goes in discovering more and more purposes, the more obvious it becomes that the ultimate purpose is beyond comprehension”. As we all struggle and fail to read the mind and purposes of Vladimir Putin, fear replaces rationality, the Leviathan unleashes its power, and all hope seems lost. But there is a different perspective from which to think about hope. Hope is needed most exactly when the world looks hopeless. For Kant, hope is not something you find in the world, it is a categorical imperative. We can retreat from each other or we can envisage political projects that are genuinely inclusive: a departure from the status quo, from the world of spheres of influence and boundaries that protect existing military and economic interests. Which of these attitudes prevails at any given point depends on the expectations we have for each other, on whether we see one another as targets to destroy or fellow humans with whom to engage. The European project of a cosmopolitan federation of states, including Russia, is discussed in the opening pages of War and Peace. “Perpetual peace is possible,” Tolstoy’s Pierre Bezukhov says, “but not by a balance of political power.” Tolstoy teaches us that even in the midst of fatal conflict, some confidence in the humanity of the enemy must remain. When hostilities degenerate into a war of extermination, Kant argues, all justice is destroyed and perpetual peace turns into “the vast burial ground of the human race”. In this world, no bunkers can be of any help. The greater the terror of war, the more pressing the moral duty to hope.

3/21/2022,"Apple’s cut-price iPhone is back and has been upgraded for 2022, with a faster chip and 5G making it an even better bargain than before. The third-generation iPhone SE costs £419 ($429/A$719) and is the cheapest smartphone Apple sells, priced to compete with myriad mid-range Android devices. On the face of it, the iPhone SE doesn’t look that tempting a proposition. There are cheaper smartphones available and it only comes with 64GB of storage. The 4.7in LCD display is bright, but cramped and markedly less crisp and vibrant than competitors. It is basically the same as the previous version from 2020 on the outside, which already looked extremely dated. But while the phone may look decidedly old school on the outside, internally it is anything but. It has Apple’s latest A15 chip, which is the fastest on the block and the same one in the top of the line iPhone 13 Pro. The phone is extremely responsive in use and will continue to be so for years. It runs the latest version of iOS and all the apps and games you might want, except Fortnite. It has 5G, wifi 6, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging, water resistance and all the things you’d expect of a modern phone in 2022. Battery life is average for a modern smartphone, lasting in the region of 30 hours between charges with the screen on for about four hours using various messaging services and apps, and two hours of 5G. That’s a couple of hours longer than its predecessor but miles behind the 46-hour iPhone 13. Use more 4G or 5G mobile data than wifi and battery life will be shorter but the iPhone SE should generally last about a day of use as long as you’re not gaming for long sessions. Screen: 4.7in Retina HD (LCD) (326ppi) Processor: Apple A15 Bionic RAM: 4GB Storage: 64, 128 or 256GB Operating system: iOS 15.4 Camera: 12MP rear camera with OIS, 7MP front-facing camera Connectivity: 5G, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, and GPS Water resistance: IP67 (1m up to 30 minutes) Dimensions: 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3mm Weight: 144g The iPhone SE has a single 12-megapixel camera on its back. It produces very good images in decent light with good colour balance, detail and dynamic range. Even in dull indoor settings it does admirably, but it lacks Apple’s night mode so images shot in the evening are dark and grainy by comparison. It shoots solid video too, particularly at this price point, while its selfie camera is similarly decent in good light but weak at night. Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the iPhone SE’s battery but it can be replaced for £49. You should expect it to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. Out-of-warranty screen replacements cost £146.44. The previous iPhone SE 2020 was awarded six out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit. The phone contains 91% recycled rare earth metals, 100% recycled tungsten and at least 35% recycled plastic in various components, plus 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main board. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. The Apple iPhone SE 2022 costs from £419 ($429/A$719) with 64GB of storage, £469 ($479/A$799) with 128GB or £569 ($579/A$969) with 256GB. For comparison, the iPhone 13 mini costs £679, the iPhone 13 costs £779, the OnePlus Nord 2 costs £369, the Samsung Galaxy A53 costs £399, the Fairphone 4 costs £499 and the Google Pixel 6 costs £599. The iPhone SE is one of the best bargains in modern smartphones. It is not the flashiest or most feature-rich but it offers more bang for buck for longer than any other. It has an almost vintage design, lacks the MagSafe charging and accessory system, Face ID and other niceties of Apple’s more expensive models, but is otherwise a solid phone. At £419 it is Apple’s cheapest model, competing with mid-range devices from Samsung and myriad Chinese phone companies, many of which offer bigger, better screens, more cameras and greater storage. But unlike its rivals, it has Apple’s top chip, 5G, the latest version of iOS and will, crucially, be supported for a very long time with software and security updates – it should be safe to use for seven years or more. When even the best competition at this price tops out at only four years of updates, the iPhone SE will last longer than any other mid-range phone. And because it is an iPhone, it benefits from a huge ecosystem of third-party accessories, plus you can get it fixed if you break it and the battery can be replaced when it wears out. The starting 64GB of storage will be enough if you store your photos in the cloud and don’t download lots of games and movies. That makes the iPhone SE the best new smartphone for people who don’t really care about phones – it gets the job done and will last as long as possible. Pros: lowest-cost new iPhone, about seven years of software support, A15 chip, 5G, wireless charging, decent single-lens camera, top performance, easy to handle, water resistance, Touch ID, amazing value. Cons: battery life could be better, no headphone socket, no zoom camera, no Face ID, dated design, very slow charging, no MagSafe.

3/21/2022,"Last year I bought an iPad Pro from the Apple website. After six months of use I noticed that the frame had warped substantially, so I took it to the Apple store in London’s Covent Garden. The staff declared that the problem must have been caused by accidental damage and insisted that I pay a £350 out-of-warranty charge to replace it. I reluctantly paid up, and took the new iPad home, but within two days noticed that it, too, had developed a slight warp. The next day a thick band developed down the middle of the screen, making the iPad unusable. Back I went to the store – well within the 14-day timeframe Apple insists on – and was again told that this must be accidental damage. By now, very fed up, I contacted Apple’s customer support, which led me to understand that the shop would replace the iPad without further cost. But this was later refused. During the course of the conversations, Apple staff suggested that the bend might be the result, among other things, of the iPad being carried in a backpack. Ours has remained at home for the duration, and the second one was carried home in its box, and again didn’t leave the house. I have paid more than £1,000 and no longer have a working iPad. Interestingly, we have two other iPads in the house, one of which is 10 years old, and both are fine, suggesting to me that there is a design fault with this model, rather than anything we are doing. I also understand that I am not the only person to experience this. PD, Oxford In 2019 Apple was forced to admit that its latest iPad Pros were bending or warping very slightly, owing to the way the tablets were being manufactured. It followed a host of complaints from owners. Apple claimed, at the time, that this was not a defect. A similar problem also affected some iPhones warping when carried in people’s pockets, and the problem has since become known as “Bendgate”. Your letter, and a quick look online, suggest that the issue is ongoing. The company put out a directive on the subject in 2019 in which it invited customers whose iPads have deviated more than 0.4mm to contact it. I asked Apple about your case and, after initially saying that it would not be able to help you, it had a last-minute change of heart and says it will now replace your device. It says the first iPad you bought had been found to be out of warranty because the damage had been caused by you. It didn’t address the fact that its replacement had also failed. “On this occasion, Apple is offering to replace the iPad due to incorrect information given about the 14-day return policy, which does not apply for replacement devices,” it says. This suggests that those who pay its out-of-warranty fees, in return for a replacement, have no comeback if that item fails as well. Personally, I don’t think that position would stand up in court, but it wouldn’t be the first time Apple took such a stance. In 2016 the company was forced into a big U-turn after Guardian Money highlighted how the company was “bricking” iPhone 6s (ie, rendering them as technologically useful as a brick) if they had been repaired by a third party. This, in part, prompted the “right to repair” movement that has since taken off, and which Apple has resisted all the way.

3/21/2022,"Q I’m an older first-time buyer and intend to get a mortgage on a property that is worth no more than £110,000. The mortgage period is 15 years and I have a 15% deposit. As I’m new to buying, I’m confused about fixed-term mortgages. Am I correct in thinking that, in theory, if I were to remortgage after a, say, two- to three-year fixed rate, the loan-to-value rate will have gone down, as I will have paid off some of my mortgage and the house presumably would have risen in value and therefore my mortgage payments would be a little less?RH A You are right in thinking that after two to three years of a repayment mortgage, you will have paid off some of the mortgage loan, so the percentage of the value of your home which the mortgage makes up will have gone down (assuming that the value is the same or greater than when you bought the property). This is the case with any repayment mortgage, not only fixed-rate loans. In the early years of a repayment mortgage it is true that most of the monthly mortgage payment is used to pay interest but a modest amount is also used to pay back the original loan. The percentage of the loan paid off at the end of the year can be a measly 1% at the end of the first year but will be more like 5% at the end of year three. Unless the interest rate changes, the monthly mortgage payments won’t change, so reducing the loan to value doesn’t reduce the monthly payments. But it can if you remortgage at the end of your fixed rate because you will find that the lower the loan-to-value, the better the interest rate that is offered. For example, with a variable tracker mortgage at HSBC, an 80% mortgage has an interest rate of 1.74%, while a mortgage of 90% of the value of a property has a rate of 1.84%. It’s a similar story with fixed-rate deals.  Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

Almost 19% of people aged 15 to 24 had anxiety and 14% had depression in 2020-21, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ latest National Health Survey released on Monday. Those figures steadily declined as people got older, and by the time Australians hit 75, just over 7% had anxiety and the same percentage had depression. Patrick McGorry, the executive director of youth mental health organisation Orygen and professor of youth mental health at the University of Melbourne, said a “perfect storm” hit people when they were young. “Every disorder” from anxiety and depression to eating disorders surged from puberty to peak when people were in their 20s, he said. “It’s a combination of biology and socioeconomic factors.” People were becoming adults, dealing with moving out of home, finding their identities, trying to start a career and finding an intimate partner. “There’s huge developmental stress, and the body and brain are still developing in a physical sense,” McGorry said. “And [there are] headwinds like pandemics, climate change, world wars, and the wealth transfer … from young people to baby boomers. They can’t buy houses and they’re under a lot of financial stress.” On top of all that, McGorry said, younger people were “too grown up for the child services and too early stage for the adult services”. He said Headspace – where he is a founding board member – had developed a blueprint to overcome that issue but it needed funding to be expanded. He is hopeful that whoever wins the May election will come up with the money. “I feel like I’m pushing on an open door,” he said. The ABS found 10.7% of adults were daily smokers; for those aged 18 to 24 it was 8.3%. While 83.3% of the younger age group had never smoked, 21.7% had tried vaping compared to just under 10% of adults overall. It was the first time the ABS surveyed people’s vaping habits. Laura Bajurny, an Alcohol and Drug Foundation spokesperson, said young people could easily get both nicotine and non-nicotine vapes online, that both were harmful, and that they were being aggressively marketed. “Social media marketing around vaping has been really aggressive and targeted at young people,” she said. The ABS survey also found one in four Australians drinks too much. About one in three men drinks more than 10 standard drinks a week, compared to about one in five women. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning People in the 18 to 24 age bracket were less likely than the average to have consumed more than ten drinks in the past week, but more likely to have consumed five or more on any day at least once a month. That’s consistent with “heavy episodic drinking”, Bajurny said. “The tragedy is that kind of heavy alcohol consumption is connected to some of the most common causes of death for young people – accidents and injuries including drownings, motor vehicle crashes. “We know that alcohol consumption is the second leading modifiable risk factor for suicide and self-harm in men.” It also found almost eight in 10 Australians have a long-term health condition. The conditions listed include cancer, diabetes and asthma, as well as short or longsightedness, hay fever and allergies. Of the 78.6% of people reporting a condition in 2020-21, about half had a chronic condition. The data was collected differently for the 2020-21 year, and cannot be compared to previous years, the ABS said. Youth mental health help is available from Headspace.

3/21/2022,"Former NSW deputy premier John Barilaro withdrew from public life and was “considering self-harm” after a series of YouTube videos by the comedian Jordan Shanks, a former adviser has told a court. Monday marked the first day of Barilaro’s trial against tech giant Google over videos posted by Shanks under the nom de plume FriendlyJordies in September and October 2020. Barilaro sued both Shanks and Google, the owner of YouTube, over the two videos titled bruz and Secret Dictatorship, claiming they were “vile and racist” and brought him into “public disrepute, odium, ridicule and contempt”. The claim against Shanks was settled in November last year, with Shanks apologising for any hurt caused, editing parts of two videos and paying legal costs but not damages. However the case against Google continued. During the hearing Barilaro’s former deputy chief of staff, Jeff McCormack, told the court the then member for Monaro had gone from being an “incredibly social” person with an “infectious energy and enthusiasm” to becoming withdrawn, including attempting to disguise himself while in public. McCormack told the court that he had been the one to show Barilaro the two videos at the centre of the case, and witnessed him becoming “very upset”. “Having known and worked so closely with John for the past 10 years you could see he was physically and emotionally very challenged by the videos,” he said. McCormack told the court Barilaro had received numerous threats following the publication of the videos, including to his family. “Having been a pollie for a while I think John was used to copping a bit of flack on the internet but I think that some of the comments, in particular the ones around his [family], were the ones he approached me [about] with real concern,” he said. Sitting in the courtroom, Barilaro wiped away tears as McCormack described the emotional toll he said the videos had on him. McCormack told the court that he had been with Barilaro on “several occasions” when he had been approached by members of the public making reference to the videos at the centre of the defamation case. He said the “confrontations” included people “making racist comments accusing him of corruption in front of his family, in front of his friends, in front of his children”. “It was extremely confronting because they were very aggressive in their nature,” he said. “I’ve worked in politics for a number of years on some pretty hotly contested campaigns; this was probably the most vile and aggressive confrontations I’ve witnessed.” McCormack said that after the second video was published in October 2020, Barilaro was considering resigning from parliament, and discussed self-harm. “John was basically at the physical point where he was considering self-harm and discussing resignation from his role and basically the video had gone beyond the pale,” he said. “He was very emotional during that conversation.” Google had initially sought to rely on defences of qualified privilege and honest opinion in publishing the two videos. But days out from the trial, the tech firm dropped the majority of its defences, bar the new public interest defence, which can only apply to publications made after 1 July, 2021, when the new Defamation Act came into force. Barilaro’s lawyers say the withdrawal of the other defences means the case is largely a matter of damages. On Monday Barilaro’s barrister, Sue Chrysanthou SC, told the court the videos led to him being “driven out of public office”. “The hate messages he received, people approaching him on the street, the harassment he felt and the hurt that caused him was instrumental in his decision to leave politics in October last year,” she said. Chrysanthou told the court the former deputy premier would seek aggravated damages “at the top of the range” against Google for what she described as its “extreme” conduct in publishing “offensive material” by Shanks. This included “terrible allegations” made against his lawyers by Shanks following the settlement that were “plainly absurd”, she said. “The only rational conclusion to be drawn is a motive on behalf of Google to waste my client’s time and money, or otherwise put pressure on him to settle the case, because he as an individual is confronted with a gargantuan company,” she said. “My client should have had a judgement against Google seven months ago [but its actions] caused my client to expend hundreds of thousands of dollars in this case as an individual against a company worth billions and billions.” Monday’s hearing also saw character witnesses for Barilaro, including the Canberra Raiders NRL coach Ricky Stuart. Stuart told the court he had known Barilaro for about 20 years, describing him as a “caring person” who was “very generous in his time”. “I know John can find himself talking to the prime minister [and being] at ease and very comfortable and or be at a pub in Queanbeyan making people around him feel very comfortable,” he said. “I’ve seen this first hand. I talk about John caring for people, this is where I’ve seen it first hand.” The trial continues.",News/Australia news,"John Barilaro ‘considered self-harm’ after FriendlyJordies YouTube videos, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/john-barilaro-considered-self-harm-after-friendlyjordies-youtube-videos-court-hears
3/21/2022,"Residents of the northern Ukrainian town of Novoselytsya should seek shelter after shelling caused an ammonia leak at a nearby chemical factory, an official said, as intense fighting with Russian forces in the area continues. According to an update from the Sumy regional military administration, the site of the Sumykhimprom plant, which produces fertilisers, was shelled at 3.55am on Monday morning. “As a result of the shelling 1 tank with ammonia was damaged,” Ukraine’s state emergency services said in an update on its Telegram account, adding that as of 5am there was a slight leakage of ammonia. Rescue workers were fixing a damaged pipeline and an employee at the plant was reportedly injured. О 07:49 аварію по викиду аміаку у м.

He said the area within a 2.5km radius around the plant was hazardous, adding that residents should seek refuge in shelters and basements for protection while describing ammonia as a “colourless gas with a pungent suffocating odour”. “Ammonia is lighter than air, therefore shelters, basements and lower floors should be used for protection,” Zhyvytsky said in a Telegram message. He added that emergency crews were at the scene and prevailing winds meant the nearby city of Sumy – with a prewar population of about 250,000 – was not under immediate threat. According to Sumykhimprom’s website the facility produces a range of chemical fertilisers. Sumy, about 350km (220 miles) east of Kyiv, has experienced weeks of heavy fighting. In recent days the Russian government has intensified propaganda and disinformation efforts alleging Ukraine is preparing to use improvised chemical weapons and has been developing a clandestine weapon of mass destruction programme. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed late Sunday that “nationalists” had “mined” ammonia and chlorine storage facilities at Sumykhimprom “with the aim of mass poisoning of residents of the Sumy region, in case of entry into the city of units of the Russian Armed Forces”. Russia has repeatedly denied helping Syria use chemical weapons in multiple attacks against its own citizens during the country’s 11-year-old civil war. Moscow has also denied using chemical weapons against Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny as well as ex Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.",News/World news,Ukrainian town told to shelter after shelling causes ammonia leak at chemical factory,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/ukrainian-town-told-to-shelter-after-shelling-causes-ammonia-leak-at-chemical-factory
3/21/2022,"Greetings from me, Warren Murray, on this Monday morning. Ukraine has defied a Russian military deadline that passed early this morning for Ukrainian forces to surrender the city of Mariupol. Many of the city’s 400,000 residents remain trapped with little if any food, water or power. Joe Biden will visit Poland on Friday, the White House has announced overnight. Shelling of Kyiv has continued, with at least four people killed when homes and the Retroville shopping district were hit, according to the state emergency service. Biden is due in Brussels on Thursday for Ukraine crisis talks with Nato allies, G7 leaders and EU leaders. The next day he will meet in Warsaw with Andrzej Duda, the president of Poland, Ukraine’s western neighbour where authorities say more than 2 million war refugees have arrived. Today, the US president will host a call about Ukraine with President Emmanuel Macron of France; the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz; the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi; and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told CNN on Sunday that a failure to end the war by negotiations could lead to “world war three” and he will be hoping that this week’s Nato summit in Brussels will provide him with more support. The Saudi state oil company Aramco has said it will increase its production of oil to meet rising global demand – raising hopes of an easing of soaring pump prices in western countries. From Taiwan, Helen Taylor writes how an article by a prominent Shanghai scholar academic that urged Beijing to cut ties with Putin’s regime received more than a million views before its website was blocked in China and the author was denounced.

Doctors identified lack of time with patients, workforce shortages, relentless workloads and heavy administrative burdens as the main reasons people receiving care could be exposed to risk. “The evidence shows that, after you’ve already made 25 to 35 decisions about patients’ health on a particular day, as a GP the risk of making a bad decision goes up,” said Dr Kieran Sharrock, deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee. A campaign called Rebuild General Practice is calling for urgent action to improve GP services and is backed by Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary. Tahbaz in Tehran hotel – Morad Tahbaz, who was left behind when Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were allowed to return home to the UK, has been taken from Evin prison to a hotel in Tehran after representations by the British and American governments, the Foreign Office has said. The department added it was lobbying the Iranian authorities to allow him to return to his Tehran home immediately as the Iranian government had previously pledged. His family said he launched a hunger strike in protest at being taken back to prison, which the Iranian government said was only to have an ankle tag fitted. The family have accused the Foreign Office of abandoning Tahbaz in order to secure the others’ release. Scotland’s policing lesson – It is a “moral imperative and operational necessity” for police forces across the UK to demonstrate no tolerance for misogyny, racism and discrimination within their ranks and across wider society, the head of Police Scotland, writing exclusively for the Guardian, has said. Iain Livingstone added that voices of survivors of sexual violence are “vital” in making improvements. Livingstone ordered an independent review in October after an industrial tribunal found evidence of a “sexist culture” in Scotland’s armed police. Another independent public inquiry is under way into the death in 2015 of Sheku Bayoh who was restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Khan: adopt Grenfell findings – Ministers have “failed to complete a single recommendation” from the first phase of the Grenfell Tower fire inquiries, Sadiq Khan has said. Recommendations made in October 2019 included regular inspections of lifts in residential high-rises; sharing of floorplans and cladding materials with fire and rescue services; and creation of national guidelines for evacuations. No deadline had been provided by the government for when these measures would come in, according to the London mayor’s office, whereas it said the London fire brigade (LFB) had completed 26 out of 29 recommendations. Khan said the government and the housing and building industries must act now, rather than wait for the inquiry’s phase 2 report – the hearings for which start on Monday. A housing department spokesperson said Khan’s claim was “unfounded … The government is making progress towards implementing the Grenfell Tower inquiry’s phase 1 recommendations.” Covid reboost – The NHS in England will start giving a second Covid booster today to five million over-75s, care home residents and immunocompromised people. They will be contacted by the NHS and be able to book an appointment online or by calling 119. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended the top-up. Cases of Covid are rising again, with 90,349 recorded on Friday across the UK, according to official figures, more than double the 39,000 seen on 1 March. The true number is higher: the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 20 people in England had Covid in the week up to 12 March. The number of people in UK hospitals with Covid had risen to 14,671 by last Thursday. Pamela Moses, a Black Lives Matter activist, was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote.

3/21/2022,"We live, thanks to the coronavirus, in the age of the Zoom interview. But not this time. Ken Croke does not want to be on camera so the words “Ken’s iPhone XR” appear on a black background instead. Nor does he disclose where he lives or where he is speaking from today. Croke has good reason to be discreet. The 56-year-old is online to talk about his new book, Riding with Evil, which chronicles how he became the first federal agent to go undercover and infiltrate the Pagan Motorcycle Club, a white supremacist gang. The memoir describes how Croke created a fake identity, won the bikers’ confidence, secretly recorded their meetings, witnessed their violent crimes and even spent several days in jail on a gun arrest. Over two years his cover was never blown, though some members were suspicious of his true motivations. The daring operation paid off with more than 20 Pagans arrested on charges including racketeering, murder conspiracy, extortion, drug trafficking, assault and weapons violations, leading to combined prison sentences of more than a hundred years. But some have since been released and the gang is far from finished. “They put two contracts out on me shortly after the case and they were investigated,” says Croke, a retired assistant director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). “I’m under the umbrella of ATF: they are constantly monitoring and checking and enquiring and following through on any threats or information related to threats. “Some years ago people who did these types of investigations would go into hiding – literally they would move away – but in this day and age you can’t hide. Would they want to do harm to me? They could. I’m very self aware of my environment. I always keep an eye out, but I’m not living my life looking over my shoulder.” Croke began his career in 1990 in Los Angeles, where he infiltrated street gangs and busted drug and gun rings. Over 25 years, he took part in more than a thousand undercover operations including gang, drug and firearms trafficking cases. Married with three young daughters, he was a supervisor who seemed to be cruising to a quiet suburban retirement. But when a tip about criminal motorcycle gangs came in to the Boston ATF field office in 2008, the experienced Croke was brought in to check out sources and information. Then came a chance encounter with an associate of the Pagans. “One thing led to another,” as he puts it, and he was on the case. The Pagans are one of America’s most notorious motorcycle gangs along with the Hells Angels, Mongols and Outlaws. Dave Wedge, a journalist who co-authored the book, adds in the same Zoom call: “A lot of these other biker clubs have mainstream members who may have jobs and they’re good members of society. “That doesn’t really seem to be the case with the Pagans. They’re mostly all outlaws and pretty much everyone that I researched for this book all had felony records. They are definitely a very violent organised crime syndicate.” Croke gradually earned the trust of the Pagans and became a fully patched member of their chapter in Long Island, New York. He earned the nickname “Slam” after he forcefully subdued a man during a brawl bar. Rarely seeing his family, he had to adapt to a volatile, unpredictable lifestyle where he might be ordered to commit violence or even kill at any moment. He writes: “Every day living with those guys was a mindfuck, especially when I was a prospect [a prospective member]. Every day I woke up, I wondered what sort of shit was going to happen. Would I have to jump into a barroom brawl? Would I be faced with a pile of coke and a choice? What sort of dumb shit would they ask me to do? I always had to expect the unexpected and could never let my guard down. It was a stressful way to live and my brain was working overtime.” Croke adds via Zoom: “There’s no planning this out, there’s no script, there is no ‘Oh, today I’m going to do this.’ I can honestly tell you that never did a day go according to plan. The days that nothing happened were just as unsettling because you never knew. You just go there one day and it’s like, ‘OK, this is what’s going to happen, this is what we’re going to do,’ and the next thing you know, you’re off on this completely different tangent doing something totally different.” On one occasion Croke received a call from a gang member who was unexpectedly and ominously close by and wanted to meet. He scrambled to dress appropriately, drive to a restaurant and play it cool. When Croke went to the toilets, the man followed him to reveal that he had brought a bomb. Croke managed to turn it in to law enforcement while convincing the gang that it had been used to blow up a boat. Another night, at a Pagan dive bar, Croke saw members of the gang attack a man who had shown “disrespect”. He writes: “As Hogman pounded him, I pretended to join in. I threw glancing blows off the side of his head and shoulder, but really I was punching the cement. My hand got bloodied up pretty good.” When Hogman lifted his huge leg to stomp on the man’s head, which could have broken his neck, Croke swung his own leg in the way. Croke points out: “There’s certain things that I can’t do. There’s certain things that I can’t be a part of. There’s certain things that I will have to stop. There was a night we went to kill somebody; we were going to stab this person and throw them off a roof. That can’t happen and so how am I going to get out of that? “There’s a time when we drove to a house to kill or seriously injure this man. It’s like, ‘OK, I cannot participate in this and I can’t allow it to happen. So what am I going to do to stop it?’ There’s a skill that goes to it, a coordination, but there’s also dumb luck. When we got to that house, if this person was there, we were going to have to come out of role and stop it, which would have ended the investigation.” Croke soon realised that white supremacy was a big part of Pagan culture. “They weren’t burning crosses, but the racism many spewed was persistent, blatant, and strong,” he writes. At first it was uncomfortable to be around, though over time he learned to detach and ignore it. But are there moral dilemmas around how far to go to preserve the cover story? He says now: “The loyalty within the organisation is a big part of it. You have to be a peer, you have to appear to be loyal because the brotherhood within this organisation is more important than your family or anything else. It’s the highest part of how they view things and so you have to play that part and you can’t violate that. “You have to go along with these things knowing that at any moment it could be too far and there are limits. There’s legally things that I could not do and I would have to stop it. There’s also morally things: they’re a white supremacist group and I was not going to participate in a lot of their white supremacy activities.” But spending so much time with the Pagans, did he glimpse humanity beneath the hatred and come to understand why they had fallen into the moral abyss? Did he even come to like some of them in spite of himself? “Some were entertaining to be around; they weren’t evil all the time. They view everyone who’s not one of them as a subculture and so everywhere they go, that’s their thought: you’re not one of us, you’re less than. They call them ‘civilians’ and that kind of thing. “But there were some others that I despised much more, the ones who were most violent, the ones that were just sick in what they did and the lack of regard for people. I know friends of mine who have done this and some have been conflicted for different reasons but I was not one of them.” Once the case wrapped, Croke was required by ATF to see a psychiatrist to make sure had not gone to the “dark side” or become sympathetic to the Pagans’ causes or actions. But the operation had also taken a toll on his family life. He returned home to a big hug from his wife, Ang (also an ATF agent), and daughters. But then he saw how their lives had moved on and Ang was now “like a single mother”. They decided to start their relationship over and begin “dating” again. Croke is now a security consultant for a global corporation. Wedge, 51, whose previous books include Hunting Whitey and The Last Days of John Lennon, reflects from Boston: “The work Ken did reverberates today. There’s a lot of cases that continue to come out in New York, Massachusetts and other jurisdictions where some of the people that were involved in the case Ken did may have had links. “The value of what Ken did defies explanation but the true value is the knowledge going forward for all these other law enforcement agents that are going to be investigating these types of cases. They have a resident expert now that knows this gang better than anyone.” Riding with Evil is out now",Arts/Books,‘They put two contracts out on me’: going undercover with the Pagan Motorcycle Club,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/21/riding-with-evil-ken-croke-pagan-motorcycle-club
3/21/2022,"Part of a ceremonial approach to the great circle of Stonehenge and a spot nearby where ancient hunter-gatherers shared feasts with the first British farmers have been saved from the threat of modern agriculture. The areas are to be restored as chalk grassland, which will benefit flora and fauna, including wild flowers, butterflies and hares, with the aim that they will eventually be opened to the public. One of the areas includes a stretch of the Avenue, a route that runs 1.5 miles from the banks of the River Avon to the main Stonehenge circle. If and when the new section is opened after restoration work, it will give modern visitors a better feel of what the approach to the circle must have been like for pilgrims thousands of years ago. The second acquisition is land that includes a Neolithic feasting pit at Coneybury, almost a mile south-east of the circle and close to another henge, built about 2,700BC, a little before Stonehenge. Bones of cattle raised by the early farmers and deer caught by hunter-gatherers were found in the pit, suggesting it was a place where the two groups gathered and shared food. The acquisition of the two sites by the National Trust, a total of about 170 hectares (420 acres), means that six monuments, including the stretch of the Avenue, the Coneybury pit and henge, have been removed from Historic England’s at-risk register. The conservation charity already looks after the final stretch of the Avenue just before it reaches the circle, but the acquisition means it will care for the whole of the route north of the A303. Nick Snashall, the trust’s archaeologist for the Stonehenge and Avebury world heritage site, said the areas would be returned to chalk grassland and, in the future, there could be further digs there and, hopefully, public access. She said both sites had in recent years been used for arable farming, with wheat the main crop, and had been damaged by ploughing. “Arable farming can be hugely damaging to archaeology, year after year erasing more and more of the story of the people who built and used the monuments in this landscape,” she said. “It’s fantastic news that we’ve been able to take the single most important step in protecting these sites in decades, by bringing this additional land into our care. By returning them to species-rich chalk grassland we’re both making a home for nature, and ensuring the stories this landscape holds will be here for everyone to discover and enjoy long into the future.” More than 80% of the UK’s chalk grassland has been lost since the second world war, with about half of the remaining grassland in Wiltshire. The National Trust cares for more than 800 hectares of the landscape surrounding the Stonehenge monument and, over the past 20 years, has carried out one of the largest grassland reversion programmes in Europe. It is now home to brown hares, skylarks and Adonis blue butterflies, as well as wildflowers such as sainfoin, cowslip and prickly poppy. Rebecca Burton, the regional director at the National Trust, said: “We have been working for years to revert more of the Stonehenge world heritage site to chalk grassland which, as well as protecting the archaeology, will allow nature to thrive. It will mean people will be able to experience a landscape that would have been more familiar to the builders of Stonehenge.” Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “Some of these sites close to Stonehenge were vulnerable to continued arable cultivation, including part of the Avenue.

But the remarkable images posted to social media over the past week feature alligators, not humans – seeming to confirm a Tennessee university study that said crocodilians like to have fun too. A picture posted to the Alligators of Florida Facebook page by Sandra Raymon Harrison showed an alligator in south the Big Cypress preserve with a football in its jaws. How the reptile came across the ball, and whether it had any playmates, was not specified. Commentators worried that the alligator had the ball stuck in its mouth were assured by experts who pointed out the massive force of the creature’s bite could pop the ball in a heartbeat. The second playful gator was captured in a short video clip posted to the website of Jacksonville’s ActionNewsJax TV, swimming in hot pursuit of a remote-controlled boat. The images were shot by a producer from the station who filmed a neighbor launching the vessel and noticed the alligator swimming along in pursuit. The animated alligator changes speed and direction several times as the boat zips before it. Both episodes appear to bear out the research of University of Tennessee Knoxville animal behavior expert Vladimir Dinets, whose 2015 study, Play Behaviour in Crocodilians, noted such behavior was not uncommon. “Social play by crocodilians is almost never reported but this doesn’t mean that it is particularly rare,” Dinets wrote, after spending more than 3,000 hours observing crocodilians in the wild and captivity. He witnessed alligators at play with river otters in Big Cypress and detailed the story of a crocodile in Costa Rica that bonded with its rescuer. “Play behavior included swimming together, rushing at [him] with an open mouth in mock charges, sneaking on him from behind as if to startle him, and accepting being caressed, hugged, rotated in the water and kissed on the snout,” he wrote. According to a Science Daily report accompanying the study, the results “show[ed] a softer side of the intimidating creatures – one that includes romping around with river otters and people”. A third recent episode of Florida alligators potentially at play, however, had to be discounted. A video posted to Facebook of an apparently friendly 20ft alligator named Grandpappy leading a 6ft reptile across a Lakeland golf course ended with the smaller of the two being eaten.",News/US news,Alligators just want to have fun: Florida images may show predators at play,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/21/alligators-florida-predators-play
3/21/2022,"Our police services across the UK are under intense scrutiny. The onus is on us to nurture trust and legitimacy by demonstrating no tolerance for misogyny, racism and discrimination within policing and across society. Equally, ensuring an effective and professional policing response for victims and communities is a prerequisite for public confidence. Two recent reports from Sir Michael Barber and Sir Tom Winsor both called for structural, cultural and operational reform of policing in England and Wales, as referred to in last week’s Guardian editorial. But when discussing policing reform in Britain, it is important to consider the experiences of Police Scotland. Nine years ago, 10 policing organisations in Scotland merged into a single national police service of about 23,000 people, the second largest in the UK, serving a third of Britain’s land mass and communities in villages, towns, islands and cities. Establishing a reformed service has been enormously challenging and we did not get everything right. However, much progress has been made. Under our structure, we have strengthened operational competence and provided direct access to all policing capabilities for every citizen. More than 520 murders and homicides have been committed in Scotland since 2013. Only two are currently unsolved. Our safety and security operation for last November’s Cop26 resulted in no significant violence, disorder or injury and relatively few arrests. The climate change summit, along with our approach to policing during the pandemic, demonstrated our core duty and responsibility to enable the public to make their voices heard – and independent reviewing has largely concluded Police Scotland did so in line with our commitment to put human rights at the heart of all we do. Last month, I announced Police Scotland will become the first service in the world to train and equip all operational officers with Naloxone, a life-saving overdose first aid nasal-spray, on a national basis, reflecting our broad mission to improve the safety and wellbeing of communities as enshrined in the law establishing Police Scotland. Tests remain: operational failings, or when we don’t live up to our values, are rightly subject to critical review and require persistent leadership, focus and action. We must face up to the cultural challenges of UK policing as a whole, of other sectors and organisations, and of wider society. That’s been underlined by reports including Dame Elish Angiolini’s review of police complaints and individual cases such as Rhona Malone’s employment tribunal, describing unacceptable behaviours. There is a moral imperative and operational necessity for policing to lead change to improve the experiences of all our communities, including our own officers and staff. Words and good intent are not enough. There must be action; practical, firm, progressive, visible action. Structural simplicity and stability can help drive progress: our response to serious offending has been transformed under reform but we continue to listen so we can do better, our resolve to tackle violence against women and girls being a clear example. Last year, I was grateful to meet survivors to hear directly about their experiences of the criminal justice system. The voices and perspectives of survivors and groups such as Rape Crisis Scotland are vital and help us to improve our response to rape and sexual offending. Every year since reform we have returned more than £200m to the public purse while providing better, more efficient policing. This remains an achievement and a challenge – especially given that serving increasingly complex community needs requires significant investment. Digitally enabled offending such as online child sexual abuse and fraud continue to grow at a very high rate, underlining that online policing is frontline policing. We must build the workforce and tools to keep people safe in public, private and virtual spaces. It is wrong to view community policing and specialist capability as competing imperatives – they complement each other and both are essential to build public confidence. Confidence to come forward. Confidence you will be treated fairly, with compassion and respect. Confidence our response will be professional and thorough. Reform has enabled clearer communication, leadership and accountability – key when driving change. Last October, our That Guy public awareness campaign asked men to challenge their own and each other’s behaviours and attitudes towards women. This was an important message for Scottish society, including for us in policing – as individuals and as a service. A verification scheme, established to reassure women approached by lone officers, also reflected the onus on policing to accept responsibility for addressing public concerns. Policing in Scotland is realistic about the challenges ahead but confident in the progress made and optimistic we can build on it. I am encouraged by the consistently strong levels of public confidence reported in our own research, and by the recent Scottish government household survey which found 87% of respondents trusted the police. The key assessment I apply is whether our communities and people are safer and better served now than they would have been had reform not taken place - not only for the threats of today but those of tomorrow. The answer is yes. As we continue our own development, our offer is to share the insight and value that Scotland’s hard-earned lessons can provide to improve policing for communities across the UK.

3/21/2022,"Bewley’s Cafe on Grafton Street has been a Dublin institution ever since it opened almost 100 years ago. Such is the public’s affection for the grand three-story period cafe that each threatened closure is met with an outpouring of nostalgic horror. But now the building is facing an existential threat of a different kind over a plan to sell the six large stained glass windows in the main coffee hall in a dispute over rent. Long considered the jewel in the coffee hall’s crown, they were designed in 1927 by Harry Clarke, who is regarded as one of Ireland’s leading symbolist artists and the country’s finest ever stained glass window artist. The six windows illustrate the four orders of architecture showing Doric, Corinthian, Ionic and Composite columns adorned and topped by vases of flowers with two other decorative glassworks added to a second wall in a commission by the original Bewley-family owner. The question as to whether they are windows or decorative panels, which can be removed altogether, is now at the centre of a high court battle – with the commercial tenants arguing that they are movable artworks, not windows. RGRE, owned by Irish developer Johnny Ronan, and the building owners have rejected the argument and are in court seeking a declaration to give legal effect to their argument that the windows are an integral part of the structure that cannot be removed or sold separately. The dispute appears to be one of the strangest to have emerged in the wake of the pandemic, which crushed many in the hospitality sector. But it has its roots in a longer-term issue in Ireland over “upward” rent reviews built into contracts between commercial tenants and landlords. As a tenant, Bewley’s was required to pay €1.4m (£1.18m) a year, the result of a series of upward rent reviews, and last year asked for this to be reduced to €300,000 or 10% of sales if higher. Bewley’s also proposed selling the windows, valued at €1m, to a parent company to cover some of the rent going forward, arguing the windows were not windows, but decorative panels and therefore “movable chattels”. To protect the heritage, Bewley’s proposed that the parent company would then donate the windows to the state, enraging the owner further. RGRE has rejected their arguments. In court papers, Rory Williams, the chief executive of RGRE, said the company would “not dream” of removing the windows and insisted they were part of the structure of the premises. Bewley’s, he said, “cannot try to sell us what we already own”. His company claimed that the “seemingly altruistic gesture” to sell and then donate the windows to the state would essentially leave the taxpayer out of pocket as donations of heritage items attract a tax credit of 80%. RGRE is now seeking a court declaration that the Harry Clarke windows were part of the structure and cannot be removed, sold or donated to the state. Over several days, witnesses were cross examined on hinges, brass hopper mechanisms, sashes and the question of whether Harry Clarke would have overseen the joinery work relating to the structures or not. Expert witnesses were questioned about the weathering of the windows, about the smoke and odours, smells and air from a food area and the genesis of the stained glass artwork. Was it the case that clear glass was originally swapped for the Harry Clarke panels or were there originally two layers of windows? At one stage, the barrister quipped that the case reminded him of a Christmas cracker joke: when is a window not a window? When it’s ajar. “In this case, it’s ‘when is a window not a window? When it’s an objet d’art’,” he said. Mr Justice McDonald told the court he had not been in Bewley’s for 40 years but two weeks ago paid visit to help him make his assessment. After closing submissions were made in the case on Wednesday, McDonald has reserved his judgement while he ponders whether Harry Clarke’s stained glass windows are windows or not.",News/World news,When is a window not a window?

3/21/2022,"More than 80% of GPs believe that patients are being put at risk when they come into their surgery for an appointment, a new survey shows. A poll of 1,395 GPs found only 13% said their practice was safe for patients all the time. Meanwhile, 85% expressed concerns about patient safety, with 2% saying patients were “rarely” safe, 22% saying they were safe “some of the time” and 61% saying they were safe “most of the time”. Asked if they thought the risk to patient safety was increasing in their surgery, 70% said it was. Family doctors identified lack of time with patients, workforce shortages, relentless workloads and heavy administrative burdens as the main reasons people receiving care could be exposed to risk. The survey, which was self-selecting, also found that: 91% said more GPs would help improve the state of general practices. 84% have had anxiety, stress or depression over the past year linked to their job. 31% know a colleague who was physically abused by a patient in the last year. 24% know of a member of general practice staff who has taken their own life due to work pressures. “The evidence shows that, after you’ve already made 25 to 35 decisions about patients’ health on a particular day, that as a GP the risk of making a bad decision goes up,” said Dr Kieran Sharrock, a GP in Lincolnshire and the deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee. “That could be prescribing an ineffective medicine for a patient, or making a referral to hospital for them when it’s not needed or, worse than that, not making a referral when it is needed. For example, we miss a red flag sign of cancer because we are overloaded already with decisions.” Sharrock is one of the leading lights in a new campaign, called “Rebuild General Practice”, which is calling for urgent action to improve GP services. Patients are waiting longer than before to get an appointment as surgeries struggle with a shortage of both GPs and other staff such as receptionists, practice nurses, pharmacists and mental health support workers. Asked why they thought patients’ safety was at risk, 86% of the GPs surveyed in England, Scotland and Wales mentioned not having enough time to fulfil patients’ needs. Others cited the widespread shortage of GPs (77%), having too many patients to look after (66%), and too few staff (63%). Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, who is backing the campaign, said: “The workforce crisis is the biggest issue facing the NHS. We can forget fixing the backlog unless we urgently come up with a plan to train enough doctors for the future and, crucially, retain the ones we’ve got.” In 2015 Hunt pledged to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020. He acknowledged that he missed that target because more retired early than joined. Boris Johnson promised in the 2019 general election to boost the GP workforce by 6,000 by 2024-25. However, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has admitted that that pledge will not be delivered either. A continuing high rate of early retirement means that the number of full-time GPs is still falling. Over half either agreed (29%) or strongly agreed (24%) that working as a GP is incompatible with a healthy family life, while just 24% would recommend general practice as a career. “We are at a turning point for general practice. Workload has gone inexorably up and workforce has gone downwards, and if that continues, general practice will fail. It will be unsafe for patients and therefore the NHS will also fail because general practice is the bedrock of the NHS,” added Sharrock. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “There has been an increase of more than 1,600 GPs over the past two years. “Through the GP access plan, we have made £520m available to improve access and expand general practice capacity during the pandemic. This is in addition to £1.5bn announced in 2020 to create an additional 50m general practice appointments by 2024 by increasing and diversifying the workforce.”",News/Society,"Over 80% of UK GPs think patients are at risk in their surgery, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/21/80-per-cent-gps-patients-at-risk-surgery-survey
3/21/2022,"Punchdrunk, the company that has for 20 years enthralled theatregoers by exploding traditional dramatic form and setting performers and audiences loose into the same vast, detailed, labyrinthine spaces, is taking on what might be the biggest, most fundamental story of them all – and one, alas, with terrible resonance in this particular moment. It is the siege of Troy: the subject of Homer’s Iliad, the focus of many Greek tragedies and, in many ways, the literary war that has, over millennia, served as a proxy for thinking about other, more recent conflicts. The Burnt City will be the company’s first show on a large scale in the UK since 2013, when it turned an old sorting office near Paddington station in London into a flyblown old Hollywood for The Drowned Man, a version of Büchner’s Woyzeck. The company has, after two decades of finding different spaces in which to make work, acquired a permanent building of its own in Woolwich. “After being nomadic for all this time, we just missed London,” says Felix Barrett, Punchdrunk’s artistic director. The cavernous space, once part of the Royal Arsenal, is at 100,000 sq ft big enough for even this company’s wild ambition. Not that Punchdrunk hasn’t been busy. Its trademark shows – in which the audience, wearing masks, are at liberty to follow their own instincts through the performance space, picking up fragments of wordless narrative as they go – have become sensations elsewhere. At the moment the company has two productions of Sleep No More, a version of Macbeth, running concurrently in New York and Shanghai. Barrett has dipped into TV with The Third Day, an experimental drama starring Jude Law and Naomie Harris, and there have been partnerships with big brands. The commercially produced Sleep No More in New York has been both hugely popular (it has been running for a decade, give or take the pandemic) and, to some, a disappointment, with its add-on champagne tickets, bars and pricey restaurants. In the wake of #MeToo, there were also disturbing allegations by performers and ex-performers of episodes of sexual harassment by audience members. I’m assured that the company has instituted a raft of improved safety measures, including the audience being instructed to stay at a respectful distance from artists, an intimacy director to help them manage one-on-one performance moments, and alert buttons in some of the rooms. The last Punchdrunk show I saw was It Felt Like a Kiss in Manchester in 2009, as part of the city’s international festival, and it ended with me being terrified into a panicked sprint by a barely glimpsed performer apparently wielding a chainsaw. Afterwards, I found it hard to shake the feeling that the audience had been treated rather cheaply, even though I’d been excited by their early work, such as Faust in 2006 and The Masque of the Red Death a year later. Curiosity about Punchdrunk’s immersive approach to Greek tragedy is enough to tempt me back. Certainly, the immense space is shaping up to be thrilling, as becomes clear when its designers – longtime Punchdrunk collaborators Livi Vaughan and Bea Minns – show me around the set-in-progress. The huge warehouse is divided into two zones: Greece and Troy. To enter this world, the audience passes through a kind of liminal zone: a make-believe museum that, when the creators describe it to me, reminds me a bit of the 2019 Troy exhibition at the British Museum. It will contain objects resembling, for instance, Attic black-figure vases. “If people look carefully, they will see scenes represented on them that happen in the show later on,” says Vaughan – such as the killing of Agamemnon’s daughter, Iphigenia, sacrificed to ensure a fair wind for the Greek troops to Troy. As visitors pass through the exhibit, something will happen – a ritual of a sort – and the audience will be whirled into a different world. Turn one way and you’ll be in Mycenae, the city of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. The feel for this city is, as Vaughan says, “stark and epic and big”, with a classicising style that’s overlaid (because Punchdrunk never does things straightforwardly) with the aesthetic of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis – hints of 1920s art deco in a slightly sci-fi mode. Everywhere is brimming with details that might wash over you or might not, depending on what you pick up along the way, or what you know already. For example, there’s a metallic panel that depicts, if you have the eyes to see it, an eagle killing a pregnant hare, which is a portent described in the opening chorus of Agamemnon. Then Vaughan and Minns walk me through to Troy, where the feeling is instantly different. This part of the show, says Minns, is “much more bustling. There’s an atmosphere of decadence, of parties, of Weimar.” The level of detail is again almost bewildering. Later, Barrett tells me about the Japanese lanterns, for instance, that they’ve had made up – a nod to Yoshiwara, the nightclub in Lang’s Metropolis – with Linear B script written on them, but in the calligraphic style used for kanji. Finding someone who could render a text into the writing system of Mycenaean Crete was a task for their classical adviser, Emma Cole – who got the director of the scholarly institution the British School at Athens on the job. Vaughan and Minns take me up into a building and walk me through a series of rooms which, after a bit of prompting, I identify as spaces meant for, or perhaps recently vacated by, denizens of the Underworld’s prison of Tartarus: mythical characters such as Salmoneus, a king who insisted on being worshipped like a god and who imitated Zeus’s thunderbolts; or Ascalaphus, the guardian of Hades’ orchard, turned into a screech owl by the goddess Demeter after he revealed that Persephone, her daughter, had eaten a single pomegranate seed in the Underworld and was thus doomed to spend part of every year in that shadowy realm. No, neither of these characters are in Aeschylus’s Agamemnon or Euripides’ Hecuba, which are the core texts used by Barrett and choreographer and associate director Maxine Doyle; the layering-in of the realm of Hades is yet another palimpsest in what promises to be a dense and rich story. The show has been a long time in the making, Barrett tells me. It was back in 2010 that he and Doyle first thought about doing a version of the Trojan war story. But “we lost the building”, he says, “and we ended up doing The Drowned Man instead”. Doyle takes me back to basics to describe their approach to their chosen plays. “We take all of the characters of those texts, and the plot lines and the narrative beats. And we play with all of those to create something that’s almost like a set of film-script treatments for each character scene, and each character has about 11 or 12 scenes. Then we layer those stories on top of each other. We adhere very closely to the text, but we use it as a stimulus or a starting point to create an abstract language of dance and movement, and prop and gesture and action, and we take away the spoken word. And we focus much more on the sort of emotional and subtexts of pieces.” In so doing, they also draw on lots of other texts and research, which is also where Cole – a specialist in the reception of classical drama at Bristol University – comes in. “Just this morning, one of the dancers, who’s playing Apollo, asked me if I could give them any texts that feature Apollo and Artemis together,” Cole tells me, “because they wanted to look at the language that those two characters might have. Not just verbal, but how they engage with one another.” She gave them references from The Iliad and The Odyssey, and also told them about a tragedy about Niobe (“Lost, very sadly!”), whose children are killed by the arrow-wielding divine siblings. All along, says Barrett, Punchdrunk’s project has been about trying to hoick theatre out of the age-old formula in which “you go through the motions, you get the tickets, you sit down and wait for the curtain to come up, you’re physically inactive and only a small sliver of your brain is being used”. Their approach, “has been about trying to do the opposite of that, so it’s adrenaline-fuelled, the audience’s synapses are firing, they’re sensorily aware and actually having to make decisions about who they follow, or where they go, or what to avoid”. When The Burnt City opens, there will be a whole new generation of British theatregoers who haven’t seen the company’s large-scale work before; and a whole swathe of older audience members, starved of experiences by the various Covid confinements, who will doubtless be keen to give them another go. It will be intriguing to see whether the company can produce the frisson of freshness and excitement it did at the beginning of the century: whether the work still produces that feeling that Barrett lives for, that “the audience owns their show, and they’re alive in it”.

3/21/2022,"Ketanji Brown Jackson appears before the Senate judiciary committee on Monday, at the start of confirmation hearings that could see her become the first Black woman to sit on the US supreme court since it was founded more than two centuries ago. The hearings, scheduled to run for four days, are critical not just for their history-making potential. Whether Joe Biden succeeds in placing his nominee on the nation’s highest court, ideally with bipartisan backing, could help to make or break his presidency. Jackson, at 51, would be the second youngest member of the nine-person court after Amy Coney Barrett, should she survive the upcoming white-water ride. Though her appointment would leave the six to three rightwing balance of the court – she would replace fellow liberal-leaning Stephen Breyer – she could play a seminal role in shaping the country’s legal landscape for decades to come. Monday’s hearing will be devoted to opening statements from Jackson and from the committee’s 22 senators, who are evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Two days of questioning of the candidate will follow, with outside witnesses called on Thursday. A full vote of the Senate is expected to determine Jackson’s fate before a recess on 8 April. The White House will be hoping for a smooth and dignified confirmation process under the capable oversight of Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois, who chairs the select committee. But Democratic managers cannot be complacent about the chances of Jackson getting through. Critical to her chances of success will be whether any moderate Republicans can be lured to back her at a time when opposition senators supporting supreme court nominees has become increasingly rare. When Jackson was confirmed by the Senate for a seat in the US court of appeals for the DC circuit in June, three Republicans came on board: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. This time, though, Graham has indicated that he might be less amenable, suggesting Jackson mixes in radical leftwing circles. Should the Democrats fail to attract bipartisan support, then all eyes will turn to the most conservative Democratic senators – in particular Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has already scuppered much of Biden’s policy ambitions. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, and Vice-President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote, the Democrats cannot afford even a single defection if the vote goes on party lines. From the moment that Breyer announced his retirement in January, issues of race have been at the front and centre of the search for his successor. In nominating Jackson, Biden honoured the pledge he made during the 2020 presidential election campaign to pick a Black woman for the court. Biden’s vow “to make sure we get everyone represented”, made in the course of a televised debate with Donald Trump, was seen as pivotal in gaining him the support of Black voters. That in turn helped Biden secure his own nomination as Democratic presidential candidate and with it the presidency. Leading Republicans have attempted to use Biden’s selection of a Black woman as a stick with which to beat him. They have decried the decision as an “affirmative-action hire” and a product of “wokeness” – overlooking the fact that Ronald Reagan followed through on his 1980 promise to put a woman on the top court. Born in Washington, Jackson was brought up largely in Florida and legally trained at Harvard law school. She is unusual among candidates for the supreme court to have had experience as a public defender representing criminal defendants. She has sat on the federal bench since 2013, rising to the US appeals court for the DC circuit last year. That court has been labelled the “second highest court in the land” because so many supreme court justices have been plucked from there.",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson hearings begin – could Republicans sink her chances?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/21/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-confirmation-hearings

There must be action – practical, firm, progressive, visible action.” He adds that the “hard-earned lessons” from reforming Police Scotland – the second largest force in the UK – can provide insights for colleagues and communities elsewhere. Almost a decade after Scotland merged 10 policing organisations into a single national service, Livingstone acknowledges that the transition has been “enormously challenging” and “we did not get everything right”, but points to the force’s record on solving murder cases, the policing of the Cop26 climate summit and drug overdose prevention as evidence of how the restructuring has improved policing. Last week, two separate reviews led by Sir Michael Barber and Sir Tom Winsor argued that the 43 forces of England and Wales must operate as a unified network if they are to become fitter for purpose. They also recommended changes to training and skills. Policing culture remains under close scrutiny following the murder of Sarah Everard in March last year and evidence of institutional misogyny and racism at the Met that ultimately led to the resignation last month of the force’s commissioner, Cressida Dick. Livingstone refers to the “Don’t Be That Guy” public awareness campaign, launched last October, which called on men to interrogate their own and their peers’ behaviour towards women. “This was an important message for Scottish society, including for us in policing – as individuals and as a service.” Immediately after details emerged of Everard’s abduction by a serving police officer, Livingstone introduced a verification scheme to reassure women approached by a lone police officer – a measure, he writes, that reflected “the onus on policing to accept responsibility for addressing public concerns”. These moves were welcomed by campaigners, especially in the wake of other responses that appeared to emphasise the need for female victims to take responsibility for protecting themselves. “Operational failings, or when we don’t live up to our values, are rightly subject to critical review,” writes Livingstone. He ordered an independent review last October after an industrial tribunal found evidence of a “sexist culture” in Scotland’s armed police. Another independent public inquiry is currently under way into the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died in 2015 in police custody after he was restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife. “As we continue our own development,” he concludes, “our offer is to share the insight and value that Scotland’s hard-earned lessons can provide to improve policing for communities across the UK.”",News/UK news,"UK police must do more on misogyny and racism, says head of Scottish force",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/uk-police-must-do-more-on-misogyny-and-racism-says-head-of-scottish-force
3/21/2022,"Viewers are living in a golden age of TV, spoilt by more must-watch shows, films and live sport than at any time in broadcasting history, but the cost of getting it all has risen to £2,500 a year, leaving some entertainment fans wondering if they can afford the streaming revolution. The global streaming phenomenon has resulted in the launch of an unprecedented number of services, mostly paid-for – from Netflix and Amazon to Disney+ and tiers of ITV’s latest effort, ITVX – that compete alongside pay-TV providers such as Sky and BT and the licence fee-funded BBC for a share of household budgets that are being pushed to breaking point. With inflation running at a 30-year high, and already soaring energy prices being pushed higher by the war in Ukraine, the rising cost of everything from food to petrol is forcing households to tighten their belts. The TV and video services that saved the UK from lockdown boredom – Britons spent 40% of their waking hours stuck at home watching TV – are no longer being viewed as the sacrosanct household essentials they were at the height of the Covid pandemic, which fuelled a record rise in global subscribers. “The public perception has been that these services are cheap,” says Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis. “And they certainly were. But the cost is now quickly transitioning from what is for many an automatic and then forgotten regular discretionary spend, to a noticeable chunk leaving their account.” Viewers who can’t bear to miss out on the best TV on offer – from Premier League and Champions League football to dramas such as The Crown and Peaky Blinders, and blockbuster franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel – will have to find about £200 a month on average. Enders Analysis estimates that consumers have the opportunity to access 130,000 hours of content from streamers and video-on-demand offerings, compared with a comparatively measly 30,000 hours as recently as 2016. As the market has boomed, the cost, which includes the average monthly price of a broadband and phone package, has increased by almost a quarter in the last three years, from £2,040 in 2019. Ampere Analysis, which compiled the figures, says that the increase is mostly to do with the proliferation of new services as the streaming wars hit their peak. However, UK households are now also facing inflation-busting increases in their home broadband, phone and pay-TV packages of up to 10%. And the financial war of attrition initiated by Netflix offering a low-cost, binge-watching model to build global scale – then aped by all rivals – has become a hunt for sustainable profitability, with consumers paying the price. Last week, Netflix raised its prices in the UK and Ireland for the second time in two years, making for a 22% increase in the price of its most popular plan, which is now £10.99 a month, over that period. And last year Disney+ upped its cost by a third after adding more content for subscribers. Netflix says that price rises are the cost of funding its swelling content budget, which has risen from $7bn to $18bn annually in the last four years, as it fights to maintain its position as the world’s favourite streaming service. “The streaming market has been supported by debt-funded, loss-leading, loss-making models,” says Harrington. “Netflix entered the market and set a budget price and everyone has had to come in under that to compete. You had all these profitable content companies, pay-TV and linear-TV broadcasters who had to move into streaming, and it is not as profitable. Now they have to start looking at value, and customers are going to be continually asked to pay more until these things make real money.” The drive for revenue, and the squeeze on customers, was highlighted last week when Netflix began its long-expected crackdown on a huge subscriber perk: password sharing. Until now, Netflix has let password sharing run rampant as breakneck growth outweighed the need to crackdown on families and friends being able to watch Netflix for a few pounds. In a blogpost on Wednesday, Chengyi Long, director of product innovation at Netflix, said the practice was “impacting our ability to invest in great new TV and films for our members”. The company announced a trial in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru charging between £1 and £2.50 to allow subscribers to add people from outside their household to their account. The crackdown could add millions to Netflix’s bottom line. The research firm Magid has estimated that about a third of Netflix users share their password with someone else. Netflix’s decision also means, however, that many of those “borrowing” passwords will now have to decide if they want to add another cost to their monthly outgoings. “The pandemic was good if you were a subscription service,” says Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. “People were stuck at home and even those with their finances under pressure found home entertainment a must-have. But now there is a cost-of-living crunch on the horizon. With so many pay-TV and streaming products, I think we will see consumers seriously assessing their monthly outgoings. It will be about winning that battle to be seen as essential entertainment.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Golden age of streaming could cost viewers up to £2,500 a year",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/21/golden-age-of-streaming-could-cost-viewers-up-to-2500-a-year
3/21/2022,"A married couple have been left “broken” and in “shock” after being barred by the Home Office from being together for the birth of their first baby, due in the next few days. Farzana Miah, 23, who lives in Southall, is an Italian citizen who has been granted leave under the EU settlement scheme (EUSS) by the Home Office. She met Mohammed Mushraf, 27, after he came to the UK to study. The couple got married in west London in May 2021 and their child is due on 28 March. Mushraf applied for leave to remain as the partner of someone with EUSS. At the time of the application, the couple were in a relationship, but had had to repeatedly postpone their wedding plans due to the coronavirus pandemic. Officials confirmed that they also had to wait for the Home Office to confirm that their relationship was genuine before the marriage could go ahead. Mushraf received a certificate of application, which entitled him to work, study and rent a property while his application was being considered, on 3 July. It also stated that those in possession of this certificate could “travel in and out of the country without having to prove your status as your information will be checked automatically”. On that basis, the couple decided to travel to India last November to visit Mushraf’s family before the baby was born. But when Mushraf tried to board a plane back to the UK with his wife, he was told by immigration officials that he was being barred entry because he did not have the relevant documentation, such as a residence card. Officials said the certificate of application was not sufficient. Miah had to return to the UK alone. On 10 February, the Home Office refused his application, saying he had failed to provide sufficient evidence that he was a “durable partner” of his wife at the time of the application. Usually this evidence consists of both of the couple’s names on utility bills or rental agreements. However, because the couple are practising Muslims, they had not cohabited in advance of their marriage. Their lawyer, Naga Kandiah of MTC Solicitors, has lodged an urgent appeal that he hopes can be heard before the baby is born. “We are in a state of shock,” said Miah. “Had it not been for what was stated on the Home Office certificate of application about having the right to travel, we never would have travelled to India. I have begged the Home Office to let my husband be with me for the birth of my baby, but I don’t think we can melt their heart. Speaking from India, Mushraf said: “I feel broken. We have tried our best to be together, but I don’t know what else we can do. I want to be in the delivery room with my wife to support her but I’m helpless because of the Home Office.” Kandiah said: “This is a prime example of someone who was misled by the wording of their certificate. It has resulted in the separation of this family at, arguably, one of the most critical times in their lives, the birth of their first child.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “In line with the withdrawal agreement, someone applying to stay in the UK as a durable partner of an EU citizen will generally need to prove, with evidence, the relationship was durable by 31 December 2020 and is ongoing. Where an application is denied, the applicant has 14 days from date of decision to submit an appeal, or 28 if outside the UK.”",News/Politics,Home Office stops married couple being together for birth of first child,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/21/home-office-stops-married-couple-being-together-for-birth-of-first-child
3/21/2022,"It was tempting, sitting there in your shorts and thongs over the weekend, to think all was well with the world, and with football. Footy loves a ‘great story’ and the opening round was replete with them. We watched a young man who’s endured two bouts of chemotherapy kick a goal at the MCG. We welcomed back another who has had to retrain his neural pathways, and who recently admitted “I was a shell of the person I was”. We drank in the joy and lunacy of Joe Daniher. In Jason Horne-Francis and Nick Daicos, we saw the future. After two years of cardboard cut-outs and fake crowd noise, we were gifted heaving crowds and high scores. But we also saw the industry at its worst. On Thursday, Fox Sports’ Tom Morris was sacked for what he conceded were “disgusting and disgraceful” comments about a work colleague, after recording emerged of him using homophobic and sexist language in reference to her. In the time it took to walk the dog, he went from the high moral ground to a figure of national opprobrium. It was not a good day to be a bloke with a press pass. It was not a good day to be a woman in the media, or a woman who loves sport. There was schadenfreude. There were straw men galore. And there were no winners. Apparently it was incumbent on everyone who had written an article – or even published a tweet condemning Beveridge – to go 10 times as hard at Morris. Apparently, you had to pick a side. One football reporter issued a statement from the Notes section of his iPhone, hoping that Morris wouldn’t be ‘permanently cancelled’. There was a common lament, echoed in Nicole Hayes’s piece today: ‘where are the men’s voices here?’, ‘why, after reacting as though the Beveridge press conference was the worst atrocity ever committed, have you all suddenly gone silent?’ and ‘why, just like in Canberra, is it women doing all the heavy lifting?’ I am hardly in a position to preach from the puritanical pulpit on this. Few are. But as a bloke, it was an opportune time to shut up, to listen, and to learn something. Most of us could safely say we would never denigrate a work colleague like that. But the tone, if not the content, was familiar to any man who has ever gathered in a group and run with the pack. It was a tone that scores of women referenced in post after post, in article after article. It is a tone that emerges when the veneer of professionalism is removed. Many said they do not feel safe or fully supported working in this industry. They are women who find it difficult to trust the men they work alongside, who constantly have to prove they belong and who are regularly belittled online. Kelli Underwood, a colleague of Morris, said she felt “sick in the stomach”. For men following this story, there was utter astonishment, followed by a certain shame. For women, it came as no surprise at all. There was just a simmering fury. Compared to the dark old days, the industry really has come a long way on this issue. But it was miles behind to begin with. Even now, you really don’t have to look hard. It was comprehensively laid out in Michael Warner’s The Boys’ Club, a book which was dismissed by the men running the game, and pretty much ignored by most mainstream media outlets. It is still there in the TV coverage, which rewards and promotes several men whose mere presence still sits uneasily, particularly for women. It is there whenever Daisy Pearce does special comments – both in the online detritus and the way her fellow callers talk over her. It is there in the ubiquitous betting ads – which pretty much fund Fox Sports – and where the men are blithering imbeciles and the women are eye-rollers and style-crampers. But this is not really a footy issue. It is an issue in every workplace in Australia. It is an issue in our national parliament. Indeed, Morris’s employers handled this more decisively, and more convincingly, than many of our leaders in Canberra. His apology was a decent one, free of weasel words. It was a lesson to many other prominent football and political figures who have transgressed, and whose apologies often boil down to “if anyone was offended … ”. On the ABC over the weekend, Underwood expressed surprise at how swiftly this was dealt with. She half expected Morris to be given a few weeks off, and quickly and quietly welcomed back into the club. For years in football, it was hard to know where the line was when it came to be being sacked. Well, the line is clear now. Maybe things will change this time. They sure as hell need to.",Sport/Sport,"The Tom Morris story made men feel utter astonishment, followed by a certain shame",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/the-tom-morris-story-made-men-feel-utter-astonishment-followed-by-a-certain-shame
