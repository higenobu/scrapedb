1/3/2022,"
 At a time when Democrats and Republicans can agree on little, they find themselves in rare consensus in Wisconsin: Seemingly everyone there wants Sen. Ron Johnson (R) to run for a third term. Democrats view him as vulnerable, pointing to provocative comments on the coronavirus, 2020 election, racial justice protests and more, and are eager for him to take another crack at the Senate. Republicans see in Johnson a battle-tested incumbent who has twice proven his mettle in a key swing state. Should Johnson run, whichever side is right about him would have a leg up in Wisconsin's hyper competitive Senate race, where a victory could be key to controlling the entire upper chamber, which is currently split 50-50. ""I think you will find almost every Republican in Wisconsin and outside of Wisconsin wanting Ron Johnson to run because of what's at stake, and that's the majority of the Senate for Republicans,"" said Brandon Scholz, a GOP operative in the state. ""If he doesn't run, that makes it more difficult."" ""Ron Johnson is what you get when QAnon and the Tea Party have a baby. And I hope that he does run. His candidacy makes the race far more competitive for Democrats,"" Wisconsin Democratic consultant Ben Nuckels added. ""If Republicans want to see him run, I'll agree with them on that."" Johnson first made a name for himself in 2010 when he ran as a political outsider and was left for dead by the GOP before upsetting then-Sen. Russ Feingold (D), a titan in Wisconsin politics who served three terms in the Senate. Johnson was similarly written off in a 2016 rematch with Feingold only to win a second term by 3 points. Along the way, Johnson established a reputation as a staunch conservative with a knack for making scientific claims with which few experts would agree, including in 2010 when he said sunspots were more likely to contribute to climate change than human behavior. More recently, Johnson promoted in early December the debunked theory that ""mouthwash has been proven to kill the coronavirus."" In comments to Fox News last Monday, he asked ""what's the point"" of vaccines if fully vaccinated individuals can still catch COVID-19, though the shots' chief goal is preventing hospitalizations and deaths - which they overwhelmingly do. He was also a staunch supporter of an audit of the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin, though he conceded in surreptitiously recorded audio that there was no foul play. Johnson in March also praised rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 as people who ""love this country,"" though he said he would have been concerned if ""those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters."" Those comments have made Johnson a lightning rod in the Senate and foreshadow a bare-knuckle brawl if he chooses to run - but conversations with a dozen politicos from both parties still showed an eagerness for him to top Wisconsin's ballot in November. ""One of the reasons that Ron Johnson is so tantalizing for Democrats is because he's probably the only candidate that could make this race a more than 4- or 5-point race. He could be just flushed out,"" said Wisconsin Democratic strategist Scot Ross. ""I think other undefined Republicans, it might be tighter just because they're not known in the way Ron Johnson is."" Of all the issues surrounding Johnson, Democrats predict that his comments on the coronavirus are the lowest hanging fruit for them. ""It's unbelievable the things that he says when it comes to denying science and really putting people at serious risk of death,"" Ross said. ""That's the thing that really is going to define a lot of what happens with him."" Johnson has kept political observers in suspense, saying recently he would decide whether to run ""shortly."" Still, he continues to fundraise, finishing September with $2.3 million in the bank, and makes frequent appearances on Fox News, hinting he could break a past promise to only serve two terms. Democrats' eagerness to take on Johnson runs against conventional wisdom that campaigning for an open seat is typically easier than challenging an incumbent. However, Democrats suggest Johnson's remarks make him unpalatable to voters in a purple state. In a Marquette Law School poll released in November, just 38 percent of voters said they'd vote to reelect him, while 52 percent said they'd prefer someone else. ""For an incumbent senator, any time you're under 50 percent, you're in danger territory,"" said Irene Lin, a veteran operative who's managing Democrat Tom Nelson's campaign. ""Clearly he has been a very polarizing figure. I think if you're a Democrat, you would definitely want to run against somebody like that."" Johnson's campaign did not respond to requests for comment from The Hill. But Republicans boast he won't go down easily and caution Democrats against being overly eager to run against him given his two upsets thus far. ""Democrats think they have Johnson as a very vulnerable incumbent because he's been outspoken on a lot of issues. That's fine. But they also think that Johnson isn't terribly strong, which he has proven over time is not the case,"" Scholz said. ""[H]e'll be a very strong campaigner,"" added Ben Voelkel, a former Johnson aide who is running for lieutenant governor. ""I'd be very happy to be on the same ticket with him."" Republicans note that Johnson enters 2022 with greater electoral chops than in either of his past two campaigns and argue regurgitating his comments is an insufficient and played out strategy for Democrats. ""Democrats have such a massive amount of misplaced hope here. At this point, Ron Johnson is basically running a heartbreak hotel for the Democrats every six years in Wisconsin,"" said one Wisconsin GOP operative. ""These are new shades of the same failed playbook,"" the person continued. ""They're trying to stuff a few new pages, and they're trying to scribble new things in the margins, but it's the same playbook, and it's failed twice."" Beyond Johnson's own bona fides, he would likely have full institutional support from the GOP - something he lacked in his previous races. ""We are hopeful and optimistic that Ron Johnson will run for reelection. If he does, he will have the full support of the NRSC,"" said Lizzie Letlow, the deputy communications director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which abruptly canceled an $800,000 pro-Johnson ad buy near the end of the 2016 campaign. Even some Democrats concede that Johnson won't be easy to topple in a state as narrowly divided as Wisconsin, particularly given the tailwinds Republicans are anticipated to enjoy. ""I do not underestimate Ron Johnson at all, because I think some Democrats think, 'oh, he's just so crazy. Of course, we'll beat him,' which we said about Trump too,"" said Lin, adding ""[H]e absolutely could prevail for a third term because we know the environment for Democrats."" While it's still unclear if Johnson will jump in the race, it is virtually guaranteed that Wisconsin's Senate race will be among the most hotly contested in the country next year. The state is among the swingiest in the nation, and any one race could decide who controls the Senate. But should Johnson jump in the race, Democrats are expected to go into hyper drive to knock him out. ""You never really know which state the Senate is going to come down to, but this remains the best pickup opportunity that we have, and it's a coin flip state,"" said one Wisconsin Democratic strategist. ""So, buckle up.""",Politics/The Hill,"Wisconsin Democrats, Republicans both want Ron Johnson to run",https://news.yahoo.com/wisconsin-democrats-republicans-both-want-110110743.html

1/3/2022,"Every Bitcoin user and miner is well-aware of the term Bitcoin halving and what it means to Bitcoin. The halving is the name for one of the most highly anticipated events in Bitcoin’s history. This event affects just how much Bitcoin is in circulation so it doesn’t increase exponentially. Let’s find out why there’s so much fuss about the Bitcoin halving, how it works and what will happen during the next halving sometime in the not so distant 2024. Simply put, a Bitcoin halving is the process of halving the rewards of mining Bitcoin after each set of 210,000 blocks is mined. By reducing the rewards of mining Bitcoin as more blocks are mined, a Bitcoin halving limits the supply of new coins, so prices could rise if demand remains strong. In other words, this is Bitcoin’s way of using a synthetic form of inflation that halves every four years until all Bitcoin is released and is in circulation. To help you understand halving, let’s explain how the coin is acquired. Bitcoin mining is the process where miners unearth BTC through digging into Bitcoin’s digital cave with specialised mining equipment as their virtual pickaxe. Bitcoin miners have to solve the network’s highly complex mathematical equations to complete the blocks that are added to Bitcoin’s blockchain. A block refers to a file that stores or keeps one megabyte worth of Bitcoin transactions. As more and more transactions are verified, Bitcoin’s network also increases in size. After successfully verifying transactions, which usually takes 10 minutes, miners will receive Bitcoin as their reward. Now, in the process called Bitcoin halving, the rewards earned by miners fall by half after a set of 210,000 blocks is mined or roughly every four years. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudo name), set an artificial limit on the number of Bitcoin that could ever be produced. That limit is 21 million Bitcoin and will be hit around the year 2040. At that point, miners will no longer be rewarded in Bitcoin for their efforts. Instead, rewards will likely take the form of transaction fees in much the same way credit card companies currently charge for transactions. There are some things surrounding a Bitcoin halving, and two of the most important are exactly why a Bitcoin halving occurs and the impact it will have on the value of BTC.  To answer the first, Bitcoin must halve in order to reduce the number of new Bitcoins being produced by the network. It cuts the supply in order to ensure the scarcity of Bitcoin while preventing extreme price inflation simultaneously.  The halving’s impact on block reward, on the other hand, tends to have long-term positive effects on the price of Bitcoin. There are a lot of theories as to why, but one common theory is simple supply and demand: If fewer Bitcoins are being produced, the newly increased scarcity automatically makes them more valuable. But this takes a bit of time to begin materialising. Most investors believe the value of Bitcoin will increase and it may achieve better growth between now and its fourth halving in 2024. This is based on its track record over the years and with the results from the first and second halving events. At both times before now, there were massive surges in the price of Bitcoin. The first halving in 2012 saw an increase in the price of Bitcoin from $12 to about $1,150 within a year. The second halving in 2016 saw a Bitcoin price to almost about $20,000, which eventually dropped to $3,200. Furthermore, there is no precise date for when the reward for mining a block will be cut in half. It depends on when the 210,000th block since the last event is mined. Considering that new Bitcoins are mined roughly every 10 minutes, the next halving is expected to happen sometime in early 2024, and a miner’s reward will drop to 3.125 BTC. Bitcoin investors or traders should keep in mind that a halving often comes with a sizable amount of instability and turmoil for cryptocurrency. A Bitcoin halving is a much-anticipated event that has been happening every four years, with the first one occurring in 2012. It’s part of the programming underlying the virtual currency to keep its total supply fixed.  The truth, however, is that no one can say that this is exactly what is going to happen after the halving and the weeks and months that follow, even though halving events have, historically, caused significant fluctuations in the price.  ",Business/Coin Rivet,What will happen during the next Bitcoin halving?,https://news.yahoo.com/happen-during-next-bitcoin-halving-100023336.html
1/3/2022,"By Miguel Pereira and Catarina Demony LISBON (Reuters) -Disconsolate passengers stuck on a cruise ship moored in Lisbon's port for five days due to a COVID-19 outbreak began disembarking early on Monday, focused on clearing the final hurdle of a negative test before boarding homebound flights. The AIDAnova, carrying 2,844 passengers and 1,353 crew, had docked in Portugal's capital on Wednesday. The ship was en route to the island of Madeira for New Year's Eve celebrations, but the cruise was cut short after COVID-19 was detected among the crew, 52 of whom tested positive between Wednesday and Friday. By Monday 68 positive cases, including a handful among the passengers, had been detected, port captain Diogo Vieira Branco told the Lusa news agency. The ship's German operator, Carnival Corp subsidiary AIDA Cruises, said all those infected had mild symptoms or none at all. All crew and guests over 12 had been fully vaccinated and been required to show a negative rapid antigen test before departure, it added. Passengers who had again tested negative in the past 48 hours started to disembark before dawn and were being transported by bus to the city's airport in an operation expected to last most of the day. ""We're living in this situation and it can always happen. Of course it's not nice, we imagined something else,"" one calm but disappointed passenger said as he disembarked. ""We all want this to end. We're going home,"" added another. AIDA Cruises said it adhered to ""comprehensive health and safety protocols"" on all its cruises. On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised people to avoid travelling on cruise ships regardless of their vaccination status.

1/3/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Hundreds of Ukrainian nationalists held a torchlight march in the capital of Kyiv to mark the birthday of Stepan Bandera, the leader of a rebel militia that fought alongside Nazi soldiers in World War II. The Sunday march came amid persistently high concerns over Russia's massing of troops near the Ukrainian border, which many believe could be a prelude to an invasion. A large sector of eastern Ukraine has been under the control of Russia-backed separatist rebels since 2014. “Today, when there is a war with the occupier at the front, and the struggle against the ‘fifth column’ continues in the rear, we remember and honor the memory of Stepan Bandera,” said Andriy Tarasenko, leader of the nationalist party Right Sector. Bandera was the leader of a Ukrainian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s, which included a rebel army that fought alongside the Nazis. Bandera’s supporters claim that they sided with the Nazis against the Soviet army in the belief that Adolf Hitler would grant independence to Ukraine. Jewish groups associate Bandera’s followers with the massacre of Jews.",World/Associated Press,Ukraine nationalists march to honor wartime partisan leader,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-nationalists-march-honor-wartime-184747872.html
