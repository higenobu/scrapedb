12/24/2021,"Doctors have made an urgent plea to keep Christmas celebrations small as scientists said mounting evidence that the Omicron variant of coronavirus is milder may not be enough to stop the NHS being overwhelmed. In the first government study of its kind, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found that the risk of being admitted to hospital is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared with those infected with Delta.  But the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned ministers that the new variant would have to be about 90% less severe for hospital admissions not to reach previous peak levels, “unless the wave peaks early for other reasons,” according to minutes published on Thursday. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, welcomed the UKHSA findings as “promising” but said cases were rising at an “extraordinary rate” and it was still “too early to determine next steps”. The Scottish government announced on Thursday that nightclubs would close for three weeks from 27 December, the latest in a series of Covid curbs introduced by the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK government has said no further measures in England will be announced before Christmas. Official data on Thursday showed there were 119,789 new Covid infections across the UK in the previous 24 hours – a record number – meaning more than 600,000 people will be in isolation on Christmas Day. A further 147 coronavirus deaths were recorded on Thursday, with daily deaths relatively stable. With millions of Britons now already with their Christmas companions or travelling to spend the weekend with family or friends, Dr Nick Scriven, a past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, told the Guardian: “I personally would advocate caution, especially as the Omicron variant seems so transmissible, even if only for a few days. “What I mean by this is doing lateral flow tests before any gatherings and perhaps limiting the numbers people mix with over the next few days. [And] if you are not fully vaccinated with a booster, I would be very cautious about mixing outside your family circle.” In a pointed reminder of revelations of rule-breaking get-togethers involving Downing Street last Christmas, Scriven, a senior doctor in Yorkshire, said: “We are really relying on people doing what experts suggest and not using politicians as role models.” Dr Andrew Goddard, the president of the Royal College of Physicians, acknowledged that while people may find it hard to avoid being in a large group, they should do so to help limit soaring sickness absence among NHS staff. “While we are all looking forward to time with loved ones this year, we need to think very carefully about the number of people we mix with over the next couple of weeks. That’s not a message people want to hear and not one that’s easy to deliver. But if we aren’t cautious, we risk the number of available health and care staff falling to very dangerous levels,” Goddard said. NHS England data released on Thursday showed that the number of health service staff days lost to Covid in England soared by 38% last week, to 124,855. Hospital bosses privately voiced deep unease that the sharp rise, coming on top of the service’s almost 100,000 vacancies, could hinder its ability to cope with a feared wave of hospitalisations driven by the new variant. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, declared that the NHS was “on a war footing”. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the service was facing “a double emergency” of a growing number of staff off sick at the same time as hospitalisations because of the virus were rising sharply. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, cautioned that despite Omicron being milder, the health service could still come under very serious pressure. “We still don’t have conclusive data in terms of what impact Omicron could have in terms of level of hospitalisations. We have some very early studies, but it’s a bit like trying to predict the result of a football game when you’re only a third of the way through”, he told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The leader of Britain’s family doctors also advised restraint in personal behaviour in the face of Delta and Omicron fuelling a new surge in Covid cases. “Even if vaccinated, it’s important that people behave cautiously while new cases remain high”, said Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs. As well as wearing a mask, washing their hands and practising social distancing, people should be prepared to isolate over Christmas if they test positive in order to not spread Covid to others, he added. According to the UKHSA research, people with Omicron are between 31% and 45% less likely to go to A&E compared with those with Delta, and 50% to 70% less likely to require admission to hospital. The early findings are consistent with analysis published on Wednesday by Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh. Lockdown-sceptic Conservatives have seized on the analysis as fresh evidence to support the idea that more restrictions are unnecessary. “It does look like it’s less severe,” said Mark Harper, the chair of the backbench Covid Recovery Group. “I just don’t buy the idea you’re going to have immense numbers of people in hospital, given that most people have been boosted now. You might want to have some guidance, but I can’t see much of a case for restrictions, to be honest.” Harper was among the 100 Conservative MPs who voted against the introduction of compulsory Covid passes this month. Boris Johnson has promised to recall parliament if he decides stricter rules are needed in the coming days, but he would be likely to face a fierce backlash from his own MPs, including in cabinet. One minister told the Guardian they believed the UKHSA analysis, together with “people’s self-control” and higher immunity from the booster campaign, supported the idea that “draconian” restrictions could be avoided.",News/Society,"Keep Christmas plans small to help NHS fight Omicron, doctors plead",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/keep-christmas-plans-small-to-help-nhs-fight-omicron-doctors-plead
12/24/2021,"The figure of Joan Didion has been inspiring writers for decades. Her lifestyle has been scrutinised and analysed until there was nothing left. Feminist figurehead for many, overprivileged white woman for others, few can argue, however, against the fact that her journalism, memoirs, and cultural and political commentary make her a unique chronicler of 20th-century culture. Her cult status transcended literature: she built such a specific and alluring brand (dubbed “70s California whimsy combined with New York intellect”) that her image landed on a fashion campaign at the age of 80. The publication, in 2015, of The Last Love Song, her biography by Tracy Daugherty, prompted renewed interest expressed in fascinating essays and profiles. Here is a selection:  Out of Bethelem: the radicalisation of Joan Didion (The New Yorker) The Elitist Allure of Joan Didion (The Atlantic) Complicated Fame (The New Republic) Interview by Hilton Als in 2006 (The Paris Review) Joan Didion on Keeping a Notebook (Brain Pickings) As promised, here are our favourite quotes. We tell ourselves stories in order to live. – The White Album (1979) Character – the willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life – is the source from which self-respect springs. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear. – Why I Write (essay originally published in the New York Times Book Review in 1976) To free us from the expectations of others, to give us back to ourselves – there lies the great, singular power of self-respect. – Self-respect: Its Source, Its Power (essay originally published in Vogue in 1961) You have to pick the places you don’t walk away from. – A Book of Common Prayer (1977) The fancy that extraterrestrial life is by definition of a higher order than our own is one that soothes all children, and many writers. – The White Album (1979) [O]ne of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty-one and even twenty-three is the conviction that nothing like this, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, has ever happened to anyone before. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) There’s a point when you go with what you’ve got. Or you don’t go. – a The Paris Review interview (1978) I did not always think he was right nor did he always think I was right but we were each the person the other trusted. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005), which explores grief following the death of her husband We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were. – On keeping a notebook, from Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) I know what the fear is. The fear is not for what is lost. What is lost is already in the wall. What is lost is already behind the locked door. The fear is for what is still to be lost. – Blue Nights (2011) There is no real way to deal with everything we lose. — Where I Was From (2003) We are imperfect mortal beings, aware of that mortality even as we push it away, failed by our very complication, so wired that when we mourn our losses we also mourn, for better or for worse, ourselves. As we were. As we are no longer. As we will one day not be at all. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) In time of trouble, I had been trained since childhood, read, learn, work it up, go to the literature. Information was control. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) I am still committed to the idea that the ability to think for one’s self depends upon one’s mastery of the language. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind’s door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) You get the sense that it’s possible simply to go through life noticing things and writing them down and that this is OK, it’s worth doing. That the seemingly insignificant things that most of us spend our days noticing are really significant, have meaning, and tell us something. – The Paris Review interview (2006). Los Angeles weather is the weather of catastrophe, of apocalypse, and, just as the reliably long and bitter winters of New England determine the way life is lived there, so the violence and the unpredictability of the Santa Ana affect the entire quality of life in Los Angeles, accentuate its impermanence, its unreliability. The wind shows us how close to the edge we are. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) New York was no mere city. It was instead an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) A place belongs forever to whoever claims it hardest, remembers it most obsessively, wrenches it from itself, shapes it, renders it, loves it so radically that he remakes it in his image. – The White Album (1979) I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I’m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave’s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that’s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.” – UC Riverside commencement address (1975). Which are your favourite Didion quotes or books?

12/24/2021,"Anti-vaccination protesters who attempted to serve spurious legal papers to the former England football captain Alan Shearer delivered the documents to the wrong house, it has emerged. The former Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers striker had encouraged people to get a Covid booster jab in a video promoted by the Premier League last week.  It’s been great having fans back in the stadium this season, and we all want it to remain that wayThe best way to protect ourselves and others is to get vaccinatedIf you live in the UK and are aged 18+, you can book online or go to a walk in site without an appointment 💪 pic.twitter.com/JXw7QjNNoW His stance prompted anti-vaccination protesters to film themselves on Wednesday outside an address near Newcastle that they believed to be his home. In the video shared on social media, three men and a woman gathered outside a gated property and after pressing an electronic buzzer, one of them posted documents into an external letterbox. Anti-vaccination activists routinely share templates of supposed legal documents that they then film themselves depositing. However, a person who lives locally and saw the footage told the PA news agency: “That’s an old address they have for him.” In the video, the man who posted the documents says: “Everyone is going to get this, every celebrity, sick of yous. Just causing more trouble for us, lies, all lying. “That’s the truth in that letterbox there, in Alan Shearer’s fucking house.” Northumbria police said it had no involvement in the incident. In response to the video, Shearer’s fellow Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter: “Wrong house, wrong cause, all kinds of wrong.” It is not the first time that anti-vaccine protesters have gone to the wrong location for a demonstration. In August, a group stormed what they thought was a major BBC building – unaware that the corporation had largely moved out in 2013. Rather than target the BBC’s news operation, which they held responsible for promoting Covid-19 vaccines, a handful of protesters gained access to Television Centre in west London, which is predominantly rented by ITV. In October, anti-jab demonstrators targeted the home of the TV and radio presenter Jeremy Vine and tried to serve what it called an “anti-vaxx writ” while he was out, instead handing it over to his wife. In the same month, protesters gathered for a demonstration at the home of the GP and broadcaster Dr Hilary Jones.",News/UK news,Anti-vaxxers serving ‘legal papers’ to Alan Shearer go to wrong address,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/anti-vaccine-protesters-alan-shearer-booster-jab-wrong-address
12/24/2021,"For Steven Bergwijn, it comes down to a single issue, which involves a question for Antonio Conte. Does the Tottenham manager intend to play him? If he does, then Bergwijn would be a happy man – as he was on Wednesday when Conte started him in the Carabao Cup quarter-final against West Ham. The Netherlands winger, who scored one and set up the other for Lucas Moura in Spurs’s 2-1 win, wants to succeed at the club. It is his priority. Not every player can make the step from the Eredivisie to the Premier League and Bergwijn wants to prove that he can do it, having moved from PSV Eindhoven for an initial €30m in January 2020.  It has been a struggle, Bergwijn’s attempts to find his groove not helped by injuries and the club changing the manager three times. The 24-year-old has five goals and nine assists from 63 appearances – not the return that he or anybody had hoped for. But if Conte cannot grant him his minutes for whatever reason – it is too hard to find the room; he does not rate him; he does not trust him – then Bergwijn wants to be allowed to leave in January. It is an open secret that Ajax would take him on loan with an obligation to buy – they tried and failed with a move for him last summer – and clubs from Italy, Spain and Germany have contacted Spurs in recent weeks to inquire about the situation. With the World Cup looming at the end of next year, Bergwijn – who has 16 caps – is under no illusions as to the importance of regular football and the signs, so far, under Conte have not been encouraging. Before the West Ham cup tie, Bergwijn had made two substitute appearances totalling 13 minutes across seven games. He was unavailable for one of them because of illness: the Europa Conference League match at Mura. Bergwijn’s previous start – under Nuno Espírito Santo – had been in the Carabao Cup win at Burnley on 27 October and, while it is lovely to play in the tournament, it is a long way from being enough. To repeat, it is all about the league. His situation is mirrored elsewhere in the Spurs squad – most notably with Joe Rodon, Harry Winks and Dele Alli – and it will provide a litmus test for the club’s managing director of football, Fabio Paratici, in the January transfer window. Conte wants to upgrade the squad, with his biggest wishes being a centre-half and a player for the right flank, and the starting point for Paratici is that sales will be vital to the size of the budget. Conte has always been aware of this. So what can Paratici generate to spark the renewal or, to ask the question a more pertinent way, to what extent can he persuade the chairman, Daniel Levy, to cut his losses in certain areas? Take Bergwijn. He is no longer worth €30m because of the deflationary effect of the pandemic and, more to the point, because he has scored five Spurs goals in two years. It is one thing for Levy to tell clubs to forget about a loan for the player because, as everybody knows, there is next to no value in that for Spurs. A loan with an obligation to buy means that the bulk of any money raised would not be immediately available, which is not ideal and, plainly, a straight sale would be preferable. But it stands to be about compromise, realism – and that takes in the fact buying clubs are working in the same market and under the same constraints. The former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino became frustrated in the summer of 2019 – his last at the club – when outgoing business was slow, with stalemates taking hold and some players sitting on their contracts, their appetite for the project not as great. The dynamics were heavier; things felt clogged. Those who know Paratici describe a pragmatist who will pay more for a player he deems essential. When he was at Juventus, he did so to secure the €100m purchase of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2018. Javier Ribalta, who worked alongside Paratici at the club from 2012 to 2017 as head of scouting, noted that when needs must “you cannot lose the player for a few million”. Paratici’s mentality, he said, was to “pay and move on”. It is no great leap to see the approach extending to the sale of players. Can Paratici un-Levy Levy? It could hold the key not only to Bergwijn’s future but Conte’s tenure at Spurs.",Sport/Football,January transfer success for Spurs will need Paratici to un-Levy Daniel Levy ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/january-transfer-success-for-spurs-will-need-paratici-to-un-levy-daniel-levy
12/24/2021,"An absence of deal-making is one reason why Flutter Entertainment, the £20bn gambling conglomerate that encompasses Paddy Power, Betfair, Sky Bet, PokerStars and more, has been one of the worst share price performers in the FTSE 100 index this year. The stock is down by a quarter. Investors had expected the liberalising US market, where Flutter looks well-placed with its FanDuel operation, to deliver the adrenaline rush of highly priced consolidation, but it never quite happened. Two US firms made tentative offers for Entain, the Ladbrokes and Coral operator that is also big stateside, but both pulled back. It may be that the leading global players will have to compete harder with each other in the US, which is a less exciting short-term investment prospect (though probably a better one for American punters).  Still, here comes Flutter with an opportunistic pre-Christmas deal to remind its shareholders that life isn’t all about US excitement. It is paying £1.62bn to buy Italian group Sisal, the country’s leading online gambling operator with a 12% share, which also has a large chain of betting shops and runs regulated lotteries in Italy, Morocco and Turkey. The purchase, says Flutter chief executive Peter Jackson, who loves his podium metaphors, will secure “a gold medal position” in a market that had been near the top of the target list. What he probably means is that it is tricky for outsiders to gain a decent online foothold in Italy because virtually all betting advertising is banned, a set-up that favours incumbents with shops. Naturally, Flutter is having to pay a pretty price – almost eight times Sisal’s expected pre-interest and pre-depreciation earnings of €248m (£211m) this year – but bagging the business before the current owner, private equity firm CVC, could float it looks a sound strategic play. The UK group will be able to inject its undoubtedly slick online expertise. What the purchase of Sisal does not do, one trusts, is signal that Flutter has ambitions to run the UK national lottery. Sisal is pitching for the job, but ownership by a leading UK bookie ought to bring disqualification. This newspaper’s recent revelation of how Sky Vegas, another Flutter operation, offered free “spins” to recovering addicts is fresh in the memory. You don’t get a medal for such mistakes. Keep online casino games and the lottery under separate roofs. Unsurprising Omicron finding of the day: regional infection data is roughly reflected in the decline in restaurant-going. So, within the national fall of 14 percentage points in the number of seated diners in the week ending 20 December, according to the flash figures used by the Office for National Statistics, London was down 18 points and Manchester by eight. The only slight source of consolation was that Manchester diners were (marginally) more numerous than in the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. But it’s not much to cling to. Rishi Sunak should still prepare to be more generous with his support package for the hospitality sector – £1bn may not cut it.",News/Business,It’s hard to fancy Flutter as the UK national lottery operator | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/23/flutter-sisal-takeover-national-lottery
12/24/2021,"Local authorities will be expected to offer “safe and appropriate” accommodation to thousands of people sleeping rough in England this winter, even where they have restricted eligibility because of immigration status, the government has confirmed. A ministerial letter sent this week instructs councils to offer accommodation and a Covid vaccination to people currently sleeping rough – and makes it clear this includes those living on the streets who have no recourse to public funds.  The move was welcomed by homeless charity Shelter, which said a number of asylum seekers were refused help by some authorities during lockdown last year because they were supposedly ineligible for homelessness assistance. Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said the letter “finally” clarified the law and gave councils a clear mandate to provide accommodation for everyone sleeping rough during the current wave of Omicron infections and cold winter weather. A government programme at the start of the pandemic had been designed to halt rough sleeping while the virus was circulating. “Despite the ‘Everyone In’ scheme helping thousands off the streets and undoubtedly saving lives at the start of the pandemic, not everyone was helped,” said Neate. “We know from our own services that overstretched councils were, and are, still turning some people away”. Earlier this year a court ruled in favour of a destitute former asylum seeker, Timon Ncube, who was refused accommodation by Brighton and Hove city council during the pandemic on the grounds that he was not eligible for homelessness help. The court said the council was lawfully able to help him during a public health emergency. Separately, new data mapping the scale of destitution among migrants during the pandemic has found that thousands of people slipped through the safety net provided by the Everyone In scheme during the first 14 months of the pandemic – often because they distrusted government and were afraid to ask for help. The data was compiled by the No Accommodation Network (NACCOM) whose 138 frontline member organisations support destitute asylum seekers, refugees and migrants with no recourse to public funds across the UK. 2,771 people approached NACCOM members due to homelessness between April 2020 and June 2021, despite unprecedented levels of emergency statutory provision during Covid-19. A group of NACCOM community researchers looked at the challenges for homeless migrants during the pandemic. “You are wrestling with need for shelter, but afraid to ask for support as you do not know who you can trust,” they wrote. The research found charities provided a vital help to people who fell through gaps in government support, including 1,886 with no recourse to public funds, 829 who were refused asylum and 564 with refugee status. Another 493 with no recourse to public funds included migrants from the European Economic Area. NACCOM members provided 413,089 nights of accommodation during this period. Bridget Young, NACCOM’s director, said: “No one should have to face homelessness and destitution at any time, but for thousands of people to struggle to access safe accommodation during the Covid-19 crisis, when there was emergency support in place, is truly shocking. “While the government’s emergency support for people experiencing homelessness during Covid-19 was needed and welcomed, our data shows that people still fell through the gaps because of their immigration status, and were put at much greater risk of harm from Covid-19 as a result.” Ewan Roberts of Asylum Link in Merseyside, which helps homeless asylum seekers and others with accommodation, said some of the people they work with are too frightened to access mainstream support. “Evictions resumed in September and are continuing despite the rise in Covid infections,” Roberts said. “We had a client ring late yesterday, in a real panic saying he was being evicted: with the Christmas shutdown in place he potentially will be street homeless and outside any mainstream service”. Lauren Scott, director of Refugees at Home which provides hosts to accommodate homeless asylum seekers, refugees and others, said that she believed the hostile environment was a barrier to people with precarious immigration status seeking support from the government during the pandemic. “Work needs to be done to build up relationships of trust. But it’s hard to establish these relationships while pushing hostile environment policies.” The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has been approached.",News/Society,Councils told to offer ‘safe and appropriate’ home to anyone sleeping rough,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/migrant-rough-sleepers-in-england-will-be-housed-over-winter-says-government
12/24/2021,"The jury in the manslaughter trial of former Minnesota police officer Kim Potter, who shot dead 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop in April 2021, has found her guilty. The former police officer, who is white, had maintained that she made a tragic mistake when she grabbed her gun, instead of her Taser, and shot Wright, who was Black, when he was pulled over while driving in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center.  But on Thursday the jury found Potter guilty of both of the charges she faced, of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter. Wright was killed while the trial was going on in nearby Minneapolis of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who was accused and later convicted of murdering George Floyd in May 2020, sparking the biggest anti-racism uprising in the US since the civil rights movement. Floyd’s death had become a symbol for the estimated hundreds of people killed by police in Minnesota and the wider US, and eventually for racially biased policing around the world. The sudden and violent killing of Wright in the middle of that trial ramped up tension and grieving in local communities. Unlike Chauvin’s drawn-out torture of Floyd as he died, Potter was seen on body-camera footage shocked and traumatized after killing Wright with a single shot. After shouting “Taser, Taser, Taser”, while she trained a new officer and was accompanied at the traffic stop by another officer, Potter fired at Wright, but it was her gun she was holding. She apologized while appearing on the stand as the final trial witness, testifying in her own defense, but prosecutors accused her of a “blunder of epic proportions” in Wright’s death and said a mistake was no defense, and that she was a highly-trained officer schooled in the use of both stun gun and firearm, and avoiding mix-ups. Prosecutor Erin Eldridge called Wright’s death “entirely preventable. Totally avoidable.” Potter’s attorney, Earl Gray, argued that Wright was to blame for trying to flee from police, after he tried to get back into the car to drive away as the rookie officer Potter was training was about to handcuff him. Wright’s killing prompted angry but non-violent protesters to gather in Brooklyn Center demanding justice. Demonstrator and mother Bethany Hemrich told the Guardian at the time: “They didn’t have to kill him. I feel like if it was a white person, they wouldn’t have shot him.”",News/US news,Kim Potter found guilty over killing of Daunte Wright,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/kim-potter-trial-guilty-verdict-daunte-wright

Coventry, second bottom of the second tier, confirmed the news hours after one player tweeted that they were heartbroken to discover they no longer had a job. The club’s website lists a squad of 21 players and coaches and other staff will also be affected.  “With regret the board of directors have instructed BK Plus Limited to assist with placing the company/club into creditors voluntary liquidation,” a club statement said. “At this point we cannot go into detail … We would like to thank everyone for the support over the last seven years. The club will keep you updated on developments of the club’s future.” The Coventry and Wales goalkeeper Olivia Clark tweeted: “I have no words. To come into work and to find out that you no longer have the job that you’ve always dreamed of is heartbreaking. Thanks for making me a professional footballer and for the best 2 seasons.” Her teammate Holly Chandler echoed those sentiments. “Sometimes life is filled with things outside your control!

Our priority right now is to gain as much information as possible to ensure we can provide the right support to those associated with the club.” The FA’s owners’ and directors’ test applies to Championship clubs. Under the governing bodies rules, Coventry’s results will be expunged if they cease to operate.
