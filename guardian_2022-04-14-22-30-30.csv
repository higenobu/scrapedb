4/14/2022,"Russia’s defence ministry said it was investigating what happened to its flagship cruiser Moskva after Ukraine said it had hit the vessel with an anti-ship missile, forcing its crew to abandon ship. The ministry denied reports the warship had sunk to the bottom of the Black Sea. It said the Moskva had “retained buoyancy”, with fires extinguished and the crew transferred to another vessel. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesperson, was unable to give the cause of the explosion on the warship, saying: “I can’t tell you anything. This is a topic for the ministry of defence.” Ukraine’s southern military command said on Thursday it struck the Moskva with a Neptune missile and that the ship had started sinking. Fire had erupted after the missile exploded, it said on Facebook. It added that four Russian ships that went to the Moskva’s rescue were hampered by stormy weather and by ammunition blowing up onboard. Unconfirmed reports suggested the missile cruiser had turned upside down and had started to sink. The apparent attack – 50 days after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine – represents a symbolic blow for the Kremlin. The Moskva was the pride of Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war in Ukraine. Rumours circulating in Moscow suggested Putin had refrained from launching a beach landing and attack on the Ukrainian port of Odesa because he wanted to preserve the Moskva from danger. Jubilant Ukrainians celebrated the ship’s apparent end on social media. The Moskva gained notoriety early in the war when the crew demanded the surrender of Ukrainian forces on Snake Island, prompting a riposte from border guards on the island: “Fuck you, Russian warship.” Not sure if y’all aware of this — that iconic “Russian warship, go fuck yourself” was initially addressed to the Moskva cruiser pic.twitter.com/vCk75OwV7a The phrase instantly became a symbol of national defiance, and is now a universal meme. It has appeared on a new national postage stamp as well as on checkpoints, shop windows, Ukrainian military vehicles and private cars. The Moskva, which has a crew of 510, was evacuated after ammunition caught fire, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. It declined to say what had caused the blaze. Commissioned in 1983, the ship was armed with 16 anti-ship Vulkan cruise missiles with a range of at least 440 miles (700km). According to reports, it also carried S-300 anti-air missiles, which are crucial to Russia’s air superiority over Crimea and Ukraine’s Kherson province, now occupied by Russian troops. Russian state media said all the crew were safe. Citing the defence ministry, it said arrangements were being made to tow the cruiser into port. So far no pictures of the damage have emerged. “The source of fire on the cruiser Moskva is localised. There is no open fire. Explosions of ammunition have been stopped,” the state news agency TASS quoted the defence ministry as saying. Maksym Marchenko, the Ukrainian governor of the region around Odesa, said the Moskva had been hit by two Ukrainian-made anti-ship cruise missiles. “Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage,” he said. “It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island.” Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, said: “It’s burning strongly, right now. And with this stormy sea, it is unknown whether they will be able to receive help.” In a tweet Arestovych joked that the warship had made a “negative ascent”, not far from Snake Island. He cited an interview with Putin in 2000, when Russia’s new president was asked what had happened to the Kursk submarine. Putin replied: “It sank”. The reported ship attack came hours after Ukraine’s allies sought to rally new support for the embattled country. On a visit with leaders from three other countries on Russia’s doorstep that fear they could next be in Moscow’s sights, the Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda said: “The fight for Europe’s future is happening here.” The Russian navy has launched cruise missiles into Ukraine and its activities in the Black Sea are crucial to supporting land operations in the south of the country, where it is battling to seize full control of the port of Mariupol. Russian forces have pulled back from some northern parts of Ukraine after suffering heavy losses and failing to take the capital, Kyiv. Ukraine and its western allies say Moscow is redeploying for a new offensive in the east. The Moskva had been leading a substantial Russian naval presence in the Black Sea, threatening Ukraine’s southern coast and its key ports. This has been one of the main focuses of the Kremlin’s military efforts, and is aimed at cutting off Ukraine’s access to sea and creating a land bridge from the Crimean peninsular to the Russian border. The news of the flagship’s damage overshadowed Russian claims of advances in Mariupol, where they have been battling the Ukrainian army since the early days of the invasion in some of the heaviest fighting of the war — at a horrific cost to civilians. Igor Konashenkov, the chief spokesperson of the Russian defence ministry, said on Wednesday that 1,026 troops from the Ukrainian 36th Marine Brigade had surrendered at a metals factory in the city. But Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, rejected the claim, telling Current Time TV: “The battle over the seaport is still ongoing today.”",News/World news,Russia denies Moskva has sunk after apparent Ukrainian missile strike,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/russia-moskva-ship-ukraine-black-sea
4/14/2022,"Coronavirus infections have fallen slightly in most of the UK, figures from the Office for National Statistics show, although experts analysing the data say it is too soon to say whether infections have passed their peak. The ONS data, which is based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, shows that in the week ending 9 April about 4.42 million people in the UK had Covid, about one in 15 people, down from one in 13 the week before. Infections fell in England and Scotland from one in 13 to one in 14 and one in 17 respectively, but remained roughly steady in Wales, where for the second week running about one in 13 people are thought to have had Covid. In Northern Ireland infections fell from about one in 16 to about one in 19 people. “Across most parts of the UK infections have thankfully begun to decrease. It is too early to say if we have passed the peak of infections, and infections overall remain high,” said Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey. “We will continue to carefully monitor the data moving forward.” While the data suggests overall the UK’s Covid levels have fallen from recent record highs, the situation varies, not only between but within countries. In England, infection levels have declined in the most recent week in the north-west, east of England, London, south-east and south-west. However, they have risen in the north-east, which now has the highest proportion of people testing positive, at 7.9%. In Yorkshire and the Humber, east Midlands and West Midlands the trend over the past week is unclear. Declines have been recorded in England across most age groups; however, the trend in the week ending 9 April was unclear for those in school years 7 to 11 and those aged 70 and over, with 7.2% of the latter thought to have had Covid in the most recent week, the highest level yet for that age group. According to recent hospital data, the number of Covid patients in hospital and admissions appear to have reached a peak in the UK, with signs that both may now be falling. However, levels remain high: on Wednesday there were 15,399 Covid patients in hospital in England alone, and experts say the very high Covid rates are causing major disruption in the NHS, including delaying attempts to reduce large backlogs of people requiring hospital care.",News/World news,"Covid cases down but too soon to tell if UK has passed peak, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/covid-cases-down-but-too-soon-to-tell-if-uk-has-passed-peak-say-experts
4/14/2022,"Could Devo have existed without the shootings at Kent State University, Ohio on 4 May 1970? Flashbleu Gerald Casale (vocals, bass, keyboards): I was a member of the student organisation that organised the protest against the expansion of the war in Vietnam into Cambodia. I knew two of the four students, Jeffrey Miller and Allison Krause, who were shot and killed by the National Guard. We saw it happen and we saw the Kent newspaper say “Students kill guardsmen”! We realised everything we’d been told was a big lie. We were already making music, but when you see something like that it changes you for ever. When I saw Devo at Knebworth in 1978, supporting Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Jefferson Starship and Genesis, docile, stoned hippy types suddenly became enraged and hurled missiles at the stage. Have you come across animosity on that scale since? bhunabhoy Mark Mothersbaugh (vocals, keyboards, guitar): We’d only played small clubs before, so we didn’t even have a crew. We set up our gear wearing blue work gear, ran to change into our yellow stage suits to perform, then changed into the blue overalls again to take the equipment down. The band before us ended their set waving a giant Confederate flag, which the crowd loved. Then we came on. Casale: The difference between UK and US electricity cycles meant our effects units made these hideous warbling sounds. People started throwing things but because the stage was so high they were missing us and hitting other people at the front. The crowd started fighting each other. We got to watch a display of De-Evolution [the band’s idea that mankind is de-evolving] where it looked like Planet of the Apes. We have faced that scale of animosity since and try to bend it to our advantage. Your appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1978 [performing a radical deconstruction of the Rolling Stones’ Satisfaction] is permanently etched on the minds of nearly everyone in America aged 15 to 30 at that time. Can you describe how your lives changed in the following weeks? JSpicoli Mothersbaugh: In Ohio, nobody would hire us because they just wanted bands playing Top 40 hits. Often after our first set we’d get paid to quit! So we had a lot of time to work out our aesthetic, with the yellow hazmat suits. Casale: We came to television fully formed. Overnight we went from a tiny club band to blowing up on the national stage. When Ronald Reagan was elected [in 1980], you commented: “America turns to a bad B-movie actor to solve all its problems – that’s even more Devo than we could have predicted!” How much more Devo do you think we’ve become since then? Has it all been decline? JPH1964 Casale: Of course. Now we’re seeing the obliteration of truth, which clearly serves the oligarchs, the billionaires and authoritarian rightwingers that want to pull the strings of power, because the population is confused and numb, and ready to do anything they tell them. It’s very Orwellian. In your classic 1979 album Duty Now for the Future you claim “the future’s gonna be maintenance free”. Are you disappointed with how it has worked out? judgefloyd Casale: That’s a line from Clockout, a song about toxic masculinity. The idea was that in the future women wouldn’t need men any more because they’d have too many sex toys … and, uh, it’s kinda true [laughter]. Famously, brothers in bands can be fractious with each other. How does it work when there are two sets of siblings? HenleyRegatta Casale: This was Mark and Bob 1 [Mothersbaugh] and myself and Bob 2 [Casale]. It worked like nuclear parity. Will your recording sessions with David Bowie ever see the light of day? BluesBuddah Casale: Bowie was supposed to produce Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!, but he had a complicated schedule so locked it on to Brian Eno. But then Bowie showed up in the studio [in Cologne]. Mothersbaugh: While we were setting the gear up, people were hanging around. [Dieter] Moebius and [Hans-Joachim] Roedelius, Holger Czukay. We all ended up jamming with Bowie and Eno, which was recorded on a two-track tape. Everything gets illuminated at some point, so it will probably come out. There seemed to have been tension between yourselves and Eno during the production of your first LP, resulting in a lessening of his influence. Would you consider asking Eno to remix the tapes now to present his vision of the album? David1 Motherbaugh: Brian was great to work with because he let us do what we wanted. I mean, Eno and Bowie would go back in the evening and add stuff to our songs, like Tibetan monkey chants, some of which we used but mostly we didn’t. But he never imposed it on us. Casale: The “tension” has become apocryphal. It wasn’t real tension. Brian was into his Zen period and we had come from Akron, Ohio, steeped in industrial brutalism. We didn’t want our songs to be pretty like he did, but we were never at loggerheads. We loved him. We’d love to hear him remix those songs now. That would be funny at this point. Is it true that you wrote a song using a washing machine as the rhythm section? CanMeckie Casale: I played guitar to my mother’s machine – it had this sorta kerchunk-kerchunk rhythm. Mothersbaugh: Before drum machines we’d write songs sitting in the car to the rhythm of the windshield wipers. Our first drummer, Jim Mothersbaugh, was a circuit bender and he invented the precursor to electronic drums. How did the Neil Young collaboration come about? Fruitcoverednails Mothersbaugh: The actor Dean Stockwell hired me to score an off-Broadway play for him – Dean had shot films for Neil and introduced him to Devo. Casale: Neil had our self-produced single. We met, Neil loved us and asked us to be in his Human Highway movie. We played Hey Hey, My My together. Mothersbaugh: Neil told us off for selling merch! He said: “Merch isn’t cool. It’s not part of rock’n’roll.” [Laughter] What’s the story about Johnny Rotten joining Devo? 1234Ramones Mothersbaugh: In winter 1978, we were sleeping on couches at a friend’s house. In Bob Casale’s room the windows had blown open and in the morning he was covered in a foot of snow. [Virgin Records boss] Richard Branson called and ask if we wanted to get together in Jamaica. Bob and I went to this hotel, where there was a pile of really strong marijuana. Richard waited until we got really stoned and told us that Johnny Rotten was in the next room and he wanted him to be the singer in Devo. I couldn’t stop laughing and told him it was the most absurd suggestion I’d ever heard. Later, Richard almost killed us. He took us to eat in the mountains and afterwards drove so fast the Jeep slid off the road and got stuck on a tree. We were in the back seat, Bob had landed on top of me and, as I looked down, it was a 100ft drop. Richard started laughing like a crazy ninny. Do you still play Mongoloid? MagnusPymHow do you feel about Mongoloid now? Bertchas Casale: Mongoloid is a politically incorrect term, but the song was attacking people who used it to put other people down. I think I probably wouldn’t write that song now, though. Mothersbaugh: We still play it. It’s one of our core songs, but in those days we were totally uncensored. In the song’s defence, we got dozens of letters from parents of children with Down’s syndrome, saying: “My child is so happy there’s a song about them and they love the song.” Have you seen the UK tribute band We Are Not Devo? How do you feel about such bands doing your music? Wearedevo Mothersbaugh: I listen to these bands and sometimes think: “Oh, we should have done that.” We went to a Polysics show in Tokyo – they do their own music and some homage stuff – and the kids were making hand gestures and intense movements like we wanted at our shows. We used to play easy-listening, instrumental loungecore versions of our songs before we went onstage – parodying ourselves, but people loved it. Warners refused to put it out so we released it ourselves and sold thousands. Mark said that while he had Covid-19 he suffered hallucinations and imagined a new work for Devo. Will we hear some new material? Agustina_argentina Mothersbaugh: When they were moving me around in intensive care, I got hit in the eye. I pulled the tube out of my throat and a guy holding me went: “Sedate him!” The next thing I knew I had these crazy dreams of performing on these inflatable objects five storeys high, with people watching us from below. It was a pretty good show! So new material … yes, of course. I feel like we’re at the halfway point of Devo. We’ve got another 50 years.

4/14/2022,"The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that the global inflationary shock caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine and the ongoing Covid pandemic will lead to lower economic growth this year and next. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said the Washington-based fund would downgrade its global growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 as a result of Vladimir Putin’s invasion pushing up the price of food, energy and other commodities around the world this year. “We are facing a crisis on top of a crisis,” she said in a speech before the IMF’s spring meeting next week. Saying that the world faced a “clear and present danger” from high inflation for the first time in many years, she added: “We will be projecting a further downgrade in global growth for both 2022 and 2023.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February sent shockwaves throughout the global economy, fuelling the highest rates of inflation in four decades in advanced economies amid concerns over oil and gas supplies. The two countries together provide 28% of global wheat exports, while Russia and Belarus supply 40% of potash, a crucial fertiliser. Grain and corn prices have soared as a consequence of the conflict, stoking concerns over the impact for poorer countries dependent on imports. Georgieva said the war was a “massive setback for the global recovery” from Covid, while warning the pandemic was far from over and continued to be a major risk for international trade and prosperity. In January, the IMF cut its global growth forecast to 4.4% for 2022 as the Omicron variant weighed on activity across the world, but the head of the fund said this would be scaled back further in new forecasts to be published in next week’s World Economic Outlook. “Since then, the outlook has deteriorated substantially, largely because of the war and its repercussions,” she said. “Inflation, financial tightening and frequent, wide ranging lockdowns in China – causing new bottlenecks in global supply chains – are also weighing on activity.” Chinese authorities last week put Shanghai into lockdown as part of a “zero Covid” strategy, aiming to slow the spread of the virus. However, repeated restrictions have led to factory shutdowns and backlogs of ships at Chinese ports, threatening to hit global trade and further add to already high inflation. The head of the IMF warned that countries which are net importers of food and fuel – in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe – risked the biggest growth downgrades. “Higher energy and food prices are adding to inflationary pressures, squeezing real incomes of households around the world,” she said.",News/Business,IMF to lower global growth forecasts due to Ukraine war and Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/imf-lower-global-growth-forecasts-ukraine-war-covid
4/14/2022,"The Queen will not attend the Easter Sunday service in Windsor after pulling out of several events in recent months because of mobility problems. Buckingham Palace said the Queen, who has experienced health problems recently, was not expected to attend the event on Sunday, although it is not known why. Last week Buckingham Palace announced that the monarch, 95, would not be attending the Maundy Thursday service at St George’s Chapel in Windsor. For the first time she was represented by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at what is considered an important fixture in the royal calendar. Prince Charles followed the ancient tradition of distributing Maundy money to those who have provided Christian service to elderly people, worked tirelessly during the pandemic or been a comfort to those in need, during the service at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The Queen is understood to be in good health but has some mobility problems. Last month she was escorted by her son the Duke of York into a memorial service for her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in her first major official engagement in six months. She has been increasingly delegating public appearances to other senior royals. As well as the Maundy service, Charles stood in for the Queen at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey last month. Thursday is the fifth time the Queen has not attended the Maundy service during her 70-year reign. The lord high almoner, the Rt Rev Michael Gresford Jones, the bishop of St Albans, represented the Queen in 1954, and six years later the Queen Mother stood in for her daughter, who had given birth to Andrew two months earlier. In 1964 the birth of the Earl of Wessex in March meant the Queen’s role was fulfilled by her aunt, Princess Mary, and in 1970, the Queen Mother distributed the Maundy money on behalf of the Queen who was on tour in New Zealand.",News/UK news,Queen expected to miss Easter Sunday service ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/queen-expected-to-miss-easter-sunday-service
4/14/2022,"A Cambridge University college spent £120,000 on its failed attempt to remove a memorial in its chapel to a 17th-century benefactor who had extensive involvement in the slave trade, it has emerged. Writing in the Guardian, Sonita Alleyne, the master of Jesus College, defended the decision to fight the case and criticised the “antiquated” church process that ended in defeat for the college. The disputed memorial was the subject of a three-day consistory court hearing in February, where the college was required to seek permission from the diocese of Ely to remove the plaque from the chapel wall, where it was deterring members of the community from worship, and relocate it elsewhere in the college. Alleyne, who is the first black master of an Oxbridge college, said that after research exposed the extent of Tobias Rustat’s 30-year involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, an overwhelming majority of fellows voted in favour of seeking permission to relocate the memorial. “This felt straightforward,” writes Alleyne. “From a moral point of view, Rustat’s activities helped finance the slave factories along the west African coast. It enabled ships to transport tens of thousands of enslaved women, children and men across the Middle Passage. And it led to these people being worked to death in the killing fields of the Caribbean and Americas.” Last month, however, the consistory court decided that opposition to the memorial was based on “a false narrative” about the scale of the financial rewards Rustat gained from slavery and ordered that the memorial should remain in the chapel. Jesus College has since decided against an appeal, but has called on the Church of England to find a better way of addressing issues of racial injustice and contested heritage. “There was no question, we had to fight this case,” said Alleyne. “In doing so, the college will have spent around £120,000 on an antiquated process that it had little choice but to follow, dominated by lawyers, and which is ill-designed for resolving sensitive matters of racial justice and contested heritage. The church must develop something better than this.” Throughout the process, Alleyne said, she felt Rustat’s memorial was given more weight than the 150,000 African people he helped traffic into slavery. “Having considered the judgment, I believe that this process is incapable of accounting for the lived experience of people of colour in Britain today.” She compared the Rustat dispute with opposition to the admission of female students to the university. “Just two generations ago, women students were admitted for the first time,” she said. “Opponents cited 483 years of male-only access among other vehement criticisms. Their arguments were proved to be untenable. Buildings were repurposed and new arrangements and traditions created. As a consequence, the college is fairer and far more academically exciting today.” She added: “I am proud to be master of an establishment like Jesus College. The quiet deliberation and conversation started by the fellows in May 2019 has not shied away from difficult subjects or this course of action. It is part of our walk towards fairness. It matters to Jesus College, and it ought to matter to the Church of England.” Many senior figures in the Church of England, including the archbishop of Canterbury, have expressed their support for Alleyne and the relocation of the memorial.",News/Education,"Cambridge college spent £120,000 in failed bid to remove slave trader plaque",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/14/cambridge-college-spent-120000-in-failed-bid-to-remove-slave-trader-plaque
4/14/2022,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has opened a series of civil rights investigations into state agencies in Louisiana to examine whether permits granted in the highly polluted industrial corridor, known locally as Cancer Alley, have violated Black citizens rights. The news, first reported by the New Orleans Advocate, marks further enforcement action taken by the federal agency in the region since the EPA administrator, Michael Regan, visited the area late last year. The civil rights inquiries will investigate Louisiana’s environment department (LDEQ) over a series of permits approved in both St John parish and St James parish and elsewhere in the region, where chronic air pollution in majority Black communities have led to a wave of activism and international attention. One investigation, targeted at the state’s health department, will examine whether the department violated the rights of Black residents and schoolchildren living near a neoprene facility in St John “by allegedly failing in its duty to provide parish residents with necessary information about health threats”, and whether the department failed to make recommendations to community members and local government over how to reduce exposure to pollution. The neoprene facility, operated by the Japanese chemicals firm Denka, is the only location in America to emit the pollutant chloroprene, listed by the EPA as a probable human carcinogen. Residential locations around the site, including an elementary school near the plant’s fence line, often record levels of chloroprene well above the EPA’s lifetime exposure guidance levels. The investigations will also examine permits related to a proposed gargantuan plastics site in the neighboring parish of St James, operated by the Taiwanese company Formosa, permitted to emit up to 15,400lb of the cancer-causing chemical ethylene oxide. That project has been placed on hold following a federal government review. The investigation will also examine permits for a proposed grain terminal in St John parish. The announcement prompted praise from environmental advocates and researchers who pushed the agency to investigate in a series of complaints arguing that the permitting processes are racially biased and fail to fully include feedback from community members. Robert Taylor, the president of the concerned citizens of St John told the Guardian: “We need this investigation from the perspective of racial injustice. It is so obvious what’s happening is discriminatory.” Darryl Malek-Wiley, a senior organizer with the Sierra Club, described the investigations as “a groundbreaking case looking at how LDEQ issues permits and doesn’t identify the impact on African American, low-income communities despite placing them a risk”. Malek-Wiley said he hoped the investigations would be completed with six months and said the EPA could financially sanction both agencies at the end of its investigation. A statement from LDEQ said that its permit process is “impartial and unbiased”. “LDEQ handles all issues with a fair and equitable approach. LDEQ will work with EPA to resolve this matter,” it said. The Louisiana health department’s general counsel, Steven Russo, said in a statement reported by the Advocate that the department had received the complaint and was “reviewing it closely”. A spokesman for Denka, Jim Harris, argued there were “no widespread elevated cancer rates in St John the Baptist compared with the state average”, pointing to Louisiana Tumor registry data over decades. Harris accused “environmental activist groups” of “manipulating data and collecting and analyzing it in non-scientific ways”. Recent studies have pointed to elevated cancer diagnosis in areas around the plant, and EPA data points to a cancer risk rate 50 times the national average in census tracts near the plant.",News/US news,EPA opens civil rights investigations over pollution in Cancer Alley,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/14/cancer-alley-louisiana-civil-rights-investigations-epa-pollution
4/14/2022,"This monologue, by a woman from the deep south of the US who thinks she is part wolf, takes in the stretch of her troubled life and ends with the Northridge earthquake of 1994. The play, small in itself, carries its own devastating and seismic power. Maxine (Clare Latham) has a series of flashbacks that take in her progression from an abused and feral girl, beaten by her father, abandoned by her mother and left to skin rabbits, into a woman embroiled in a drug cartel and capable of dead-eyed violence. “We ain’t never innocent, not even when we’re born,” she says. “We know iss all murder and lies from when we first open our eyes.” Latham’s performance is utterly arresting, never rushed despite the febrile story she tells. Her delivery carries an innocence alongside the graphic sex and violence, and she holds us breathless over the course of the play, which is performed straight through and gathers a compulsive momentum. Her story is partly an angered growl against the world’s iniquities but also a reclaiming of sorts – a need to describe her pain but also narrate the gleaming moments of love and joy. Ché Walker, writer and director, manages to make it intimate and epic and his script is rich and literary without being florid. Sheila Atim composes the music and with Bethany Gupwell’s lighting and John Leonard’s sound design, builds a strong atmosphere. Latham speaks from the nooks and crannies of Amy Jane Cook’s scorched-earth set, which has a crack running down its centre to prefigure the final earthquake. Her story takes in bigger world politics, from the Iran-Contra affair of the Reagan era to the 1992 Los Angeles riots sparked by the Rodney King video footage. None of this feels extraneous but feeds into Maxine’s life story and adds texture to its exploration of what it means to be a poor, white, disfranchised woman in the US. It is also a study of being a woman in a violent world and what this violence does to her humanity. Her sudden transformations into a wolf, which signal her rage but also her power, are left turns into magic realism that might have seemed strained but are mesmerising here. She has an animal femininity reminiscent of Angela Carter’s wolf women whose skins are licked off to reveal fur beneath, and there are also echoes of Clarissa Pinkola Estés’s Women Who Run With the Wolves. This fairytale element is combined with the grit and gore of the story’s southern gothic and together it creates a heady effect. If the lockdowns turned the monologue into an overfamiliar form, Wolf Cub remoulds it into something new, exciting and dangerous again.

4/14/2022,"Tens of thousands of unauthorised migrants who seek sanctuary in the UK will be flown more than 4,000 miles to Rwanda under a new set of immigration policies, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister insisted at a press conference that the African state, criticised last year by the UK for its human rights record, was one of the safest countries in the world. He also announced that the Royal Navy would take over patrolling the Channel to intercept small boats from France. Home Office insiders confirmed the plan was to give detainees a “one-way ticket” to the country and “encourage” them to establish new lives there. The home secretary, Priti Patel, visited the Rwandan capital, Kigali, on Thursday to sign what the two countries called an “economic development partnership”. The timing of the announcement has led to claims that Johnson is using the policy to deflect from becoming the first prime minister to be found guilty of a criminal charge while in office. Speaking at a press conference in Kent, Johnson said the scheme was needed to “save countless lives” from human trafficking by breaking the business model of traffickers. “The deal we have done [with Rwanda] is uncapped, and Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead. And let’s be clear, Rwanda is one of the safest countries in the world, globally recognised for its record of welcoming and integrating migrants,” he said. Asked about Rwanda’s poor human rights record – human rights groups have logged the torture of detainees – he said: “Rwanda has totally transformed. Over the last few decades it has totally transformed from what it was.” He said the Royal Navy would from Thursday take over “operational command” from Border Force in the Channel to ensure “no boat makes it to the UK undetected”. Johnson took aim at lawyers who might challenge the government’s proposals on behalf of recent arrivals. “If this country is seen as a soft touch for illegal migration by some of our partners, it is precisely because we have such a formidable army of politically motivated lawyers who for years have made it their business to thwart removals and frustrate the government,” he said. Johnson defended the cost of the Rwanda plan, which will include an initial payment of £120m, saying the asylum system was already costing £1.5bn a year and hotel costs would only increase. He said he wanted to make clear to people arriving on the Kent coast that they were better off taking legal routes, and the new plan would “over time prove a very considerable deterrent”. Asked about cost comparisons with putting people up in the Ritz, the prime minister said: “What’s happening already, the asylum system is already costing this country £1.5bn a year. The hotel costs are now £5m a day. You talk about the Ritz – they are now £5m a day, and it’s climbing. And unless we can beat the business model of the gangs, I’m afraid it will continue to climb.” It remains unclear whether only men will be sent to Rwanda; whether there will be a right of appeal; and whether cases will be initially processed in the UK, with only those deemed to be “economic migrants” removed from the country. It is anticipated that removals will initially be taken to a hostel in Kigali for processing. Hope House, in the Gasabo district of Kigali, is currently being used as accommodation for tourists, according to Rwandan government officials. The east African nation’s government is understood to be in negotiations to lease the property, which is privately owned, so that asylum seekers sent from the UK can stay there temporarily while their claims are processed.

4/14/2022,"Uefa’s disciplinary panel is set to launch an investigation into Wednesday night’s chaotic tunnel bust-up between Manchester City and Atlético Madrid. It comes as new footage emerged of the incident of players confronting each other as they left the pitch. Tempers flared in the last few minutes of the match at the Wanda Metropolitano as the Atlético players lost their heads, frustrated at what they perceived as City’s timewasting and gamesmanship. Footage from inside the tunnel – shown on TV – appeared to show Atlético’s defender Sime Vrsaljko hurling an object at City players and spitting at City staff – . That took place after Stefan Savic and Jack Grealish confronted each other as police rushed in to intervene. Fresh footage taken by fans as the players entered the tunnel also seems to show Kyle Walker pushing David Lora, the Atlético physio, before Vrsaljko confronts Walker and Liam Delap. City’s 18-year-old midfielder Roméo Lavia then says something to Vrsaljko. Uefa Control, Ethics, and Disciplinary Body will also examine what happened after Felipe committed the foul on Phil Foden for which he was sent off as City clung on for a goalless draw to reach the Champions League semi-finals with a 1-0 aggregate victory. Savic appeared to pull at Grealish’s hair – after being sworn at by the England international – and direct a butt at Raheem Sterling. Uefa is awaiting the referee’s report on the match but sources say it is examining footage and could launch an investigation into the incident in the next 48 hours. It is expected to appoint a disciplinary inspector once the relevant reports have arrived. It follows an investigation into similar scenes that marred the first leg of Bodø/Glimt’s Uefa Conference League quarter-final against Roma last Thursday. This week, Uefa provisionally suspended Bodø/Glimt’s head coach, Kjetil Knutsen, and the Roma goalkeeping coach, Nuno Santos, and they will miss Thursday’s return leg. Both men are under investigation for “conduct (which) is insulting or otherwise violates the basic rules of decent conduct” and face suspensions of up to five Uefa competition matches if found guilty. After Wednesday’s match Koke Resurrección, Atlético’s captain, accused City of “falling on the floor and wasting time” during the second half. “Lots of the time we get criticised for this situation, and now let’s see what people think of this,” he said. “You’ve seen it, you can express an opinion.” The City midfielder Rodri countered: “Everything is licit in football. We tried to play. It’s true that in the end, because of the quality of your opponent, we were boxed in and when there are five or 10 minutes left you play with that weapon [timewasting]. I am not in favour of doing it the rest of the time, but in the end sometimes it happens.” He added: “When that [the melee] happened, I tried to stay out of it; it’s my teammates and my ex-teammates and it is not at all pleasant for me.”",Sport/Football,Uefa looking at Atlético and Manchester City bust-ups as fresh footage emerges,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/uefa-atletico-madrid-manchester-city-tunnel-pitch-bust-ups-fresh-footage
4/14/2022,"Despite people being cooped up in their homes, coronavirus lockdowns did not lead to a baby boom in England and Wales, according to the latest data that shows a small decline in the conception rate for 2020. In 2020 there were 817,515 conceptions among women aged 15 to 44 years, a decrease for the sixth year in a row, albeit a smaller one than in previous years at 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics. James Tucker, the head of health and life events analysis at the ONS, said: “Although it may be expected that this would have led to a drop in births in 2021, provisional births data indicate that 2021 births actually increased, but that this varied over the year.” He said this was because the first half of 2021 had a decrease in births, all of which would have been conceived in 2020 when conceptions decreased, but the second half of 2021 had an increase in births, relating to conceptions at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021. This perhaps suggests that people deferred having a baby until after the initial shock of the pandemic. Conceptions data is not yet available for 2021, but the early data may indicate an increase in conceptions in the second year of the pandemic. The figures also show that the conception rate is increasing for women aged 30 to 34, who had a record high of 248,528 conceptions in 2020 – a rate of 123.9 per 1,000 women. In 2020, all age groups from 30 years and over showed an increase in conception rate, for the first time in several years. Conversely, conception rates among teenagers continued the decline that has been observed since 2007, falling to 13.1 conceptions per 1,000 women, from 15.8 in 2019. All age groups under 30 had declines in the conception rate, with the steepest fall among those under 20, potentially due to a government programme aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy launched in 2018. For the first time in recent years, London did not have the highest conception rate. A 2.7% decline meant it handed over the top spot to the north-west, followed by the West Midlands, pushing the capital, where the cost of living is the highest in the UK, into third place. Since 2009, London’s conception rate has declined by 15%. The proportion of conceptions leading to legal abortions increased for the sixth year in a row to reach a quarter. Researchers in demographics at the University of Southampton have predicted the pandemic may lower fertility rates for younger people without children because of the lack of socialising and the economic uncertainty. They suggested it may increase the likelihood of older, more stable parents having additional children. The impact of the pandemic on birthrates is difficult to predict because although baby booms are common after tragic events, for example the “baby boomer” generation born after the second world war, times of economic crisis, such as after the 2008 recession, are typically associated with baby busts because of tighter household finances and job losses.",News/UK news,First year of Covid pandemic did not lead to baby boom in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/covid-pandemic-not-baby-boom-england-wales
4/14/2022,"Germany has seized the world’s largest superyacht after “extensive investigations” determined that it is owned by the sister of the sanctioned the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov. The German federal police said on Thursday it had seized the $600m (£458m) Dilbar after weeks of painstaking financial investigative work exposed the yacht’s true ownership despite a complex web of “offshore concealment”. The vessel is flagged in the Cayman Islands and registered to a holding company in Malta – both tax havens favoured by the global ultra-rich to park their wealth. German authorities said they had determined the yacht was ultimately owned by Usmanov’s sister Gulbakhor Ismailova. Usmanov, a telecoms magnate who owns the £48m mansion Beechwood House in Highgate, London and the 16th-century Sutton Place estate in Surrey, was sanctioned by the UK last month. The billionaire, who has had significant interests in the English football clubs Arsenal and Everton, had already been sanctioned by the EU and the US. Ismailova and another of Usmanov’s sisters, Saodat Narzieva, have also been subjected to UK and EU sanctions. The UK government said Usmanov “indirectly transferred assets to Ismailova, including leaving his sister as the only beneficial owner of the yacht Dilbar”. The EU said he “transferred considerable assets to his sister Soadat Narzieva, including a single payment or gift of $3m. He also held 27 Swiss bank accounts, holding hundreds of millions of dollars, which can be linked to her brother.” At 15,917 tonnes, Dilbar is the world’s largest motor yacht by gross tonnage, and is typically crewed by 96 people, with space for 24 passengers in 12 suites. Designed by the British superyacht expert Andrew Winch, it boasts a 25-metre (82ft) indoor swimming pool (the world’s largest on a private boat), sauna and massage room, cinema – and two helipads. The 156-metre vessel, which is undergoing extensive repairs in Hamburg, Germany, was last month inspected by police. However, German authorities denied reports at the time that it had been seized. On Thursday, Germany’s Bundeskriminalamt police force tweeted that it had established the yacht was “subject to sanctions law and was able to be legally impounded in Hamburg”.

At the time of its launch, the Lürssen chief executive, Peter Lürssen, said: “Dilbar has the most advanced security technologies of any superyacht in the world.

4/14/2022,"British Airways has apologised after it refused to allow a Ukrainian family, including an eight-year-old girl, to board a flight to the UK despite them having all the correct travel documents. The family-of-three had fled their home in Kharkiv, which has endured some of the most intense Russian bombing, after waiting more than two weeks to be granted UK visas. They travelled 800 miles to Warsaw airport in Poland, where they were due to fly to London under the UK government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme. Vira Rybalchenko, 68, lost her passport in the evacuation but was assured by the British embassy that she would be allowed to travel because she had a paper copy of the document as well as a newly issued UK visa and a Ukrainian identity card. The family passed through airport security without a problem but minutes before they were due to board their flight Rybalchenko was wrongly told by BA staff that she could not leave without her original passport. BA admitted this was a mistake and issued an apology to the family after being contacted by the Guardian. It said: “We’re very sorry for the genuine error made by our team when trying to follow Home Office guidance and we’ve put measures in place to ensure this doesn’t happen again. We’re making contact with the family to apologise and will be providing a full refund of their tickets.” Rybalchenko’s daughter, Hanna Zakhovaieva, said: “This was a horrible experience and my mum was absolutely shocked. I couldn’t leave my mum in Poland because she doesn’t understand the language and doesn’t know anyone or have anywhere to stay.” Zakhovaieva, 37, said her eight-year-old daughter, Sofiia, was “very traumatised” by the war and speaks to her father, Konstantin, every day in Kharkiv to make sure “he is still alive”. The family had arrived at the airport at 6am with all of their belongings before the 8.25am flight to London Heathrow. Zakhovaieva, an accountant, said they were left “without explanation or apology” by BA staff after being wrongly refused permission to board. They eventually boarded an 8pm flight to London on LOT Polish Airlines after an employee at the Hungarian airline Wizz Air created a temporary travel document for Rybalchenko. Zakhovaieva said she saw another family being turned away by BA staff and that it may have happened to many more. “When we spoke to the visa centre at the airport they told us that the majority of the families will be in the same situation [regarding incomplete documents] and they were shocked that BA didn’t allow us to board even though we had a visa,” she said. “They said this is a massive issue that a lot of families will face.” BA declined to say how many other Ukrainian passengers had been wrongly turned away. Zakhovaieva, her daughter and mother are now living with their host family in Surrey, Kate Larmer and Charlie Boffin, who helped set up the group Farnham Homes for Ukraine to match strangers in the UK with Ukrainians fleeing the war. Tatyana Moskalenko, a Ukrainian living in Britain who helps run the group, said airlines should know that refugees were permitted to board flights as long as they had a valid visa. She said: “We’re currently helping 87 families [get to the UK] and every one of these families is missing documents, either because it was lost in the evacuation or the passport has expired. This is government guidance that they don’t need to have a valid passport to travel because they are refugees – it is sufficient if they have a visa.” BA has faced weeks of turmoil with scores of flight cancellations caused by IT failures and staff shortages.",News/Business,British Airways says sorry for refusing to let Ukrainian family board flight,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/british-airways-says-sorry-for-refusing-to-let-ukrainian-family-board-flight
4/14/2022,"Covid cases are on the rise in the north-eastern part of the US, as many Americans travel and gather together for spring break and religious holidays. The rise is being driven by BA.2, a subvariant of Omicron which is more transmissible than its sibling BA.1, and was responsible for an estimated 86% of new Covid-19 cases nationwide last week, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). With precautions having been relaxed in many places earlier this year, experts have been looking at whether BA.2 will lead to another surge. “This is what the beginning of surges have looked like” in the past, said Julia Raifman, assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health. The rise in cases is expected to result in disruptions to school and work as more people become ill. The US is now at “a key point to trigger action”, Raifman said. “If we take decisive action to reduce the transmission, then we will reduce case growth… and if we don’t, then we’re really leaving it to the virus to decide what’s next.” Case counts across the US remain comparatively low, and rates are still falling in several parts of the country. But the US overall is seeing a tick upward in numbers, with an average of 30,000 people testing positive in the US each day, compared with about 26,000 last week, according to the CDC. Washington DC, where the mayor, Muriel Bowser, and the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, each declared they’d contracted Covid cases last week, has one of the highest two-week average increase. Rhode Island, Maryland, Kansas, Oregon, New Jersey, Connecticut and New York all saw more than 60% increases. Philadelphia was the first city to reinstate its indoor mask mandate on Monday, in an attempt to stave off a rise in hospitalizations, which a University of Pennsylvania model predicts may rise in coming weeks. The city will also add requirements to show proof of vaccination if cases continue rising. The White House renewed its mask mandate for public transportation for another two weeks on Wednesday. Several universities across the US, including Columbia, American, Georgetown, George Washington, Johns Hopkins and Rice, are also returning to mask mandates on campus. US hospitalizations for Covid are at record low levels, however, with 74% of hospital beds currently in use for all causes across the country. But hospitalizations can be a lagging indicator, so it’s not clear yet whether BA.2 will hit the health system hard. Deaths are holding steady at slightly above 500 each day. Doctors hope that access to treatments, including monoclonal antibodies and antiviral medications for those who are most vulnerable, may stem a rise in Covid-related hospitalizations and death. But federal funding for these medications is running out, without a new deal in place yet. Only 1.5m of a planned 10m courses of the antiviral Paxlovid, for instance, have been delivered to states and territories. Hospitalizations and death aren’t the only severe outcomes – long Covid is also a real concern, Raifman said. Official case counts are also being affected by the prevalence of home testing and the lack of affordable testing for those without insurance, she added. “We’re really going backwards in our response, even as the virus remains with us.”",News/World news,"Covid cases rise in north-eastern US, driven by the BA.2 subvariant",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/ba2-variant-covid-cases-us-rise-north-east-omicron
4/14/2022,"Boris Johnson has dodged fresh questions over the future of his leadership after being fined by police for breaking Covid laws, as a former minister suggested he should consider his position. After a third Tory MP went public with their concerns, the prime minister stonewalled queries about whether he had lost the moral authority to lead the country and said he would comment further next week. Repeatedly pressed on what action would be taken against those who held parties in Downing Street in defiance of strict lockdown rules or whether he could face further fines, Johnson said people would have to wait until the House of Commons returned from its Easter break to hear his view. “I said quite a lot about this on, I think it was Tuesday,” the prime minister told journalists at a press conference in Flydd, Kent, where he was announcing plans to send most refugees who travel across the Channel in small boats to Rwanda for processing. “I’ll be saying more when I update parliament, as you can imagine, next week. You’ll probably have to wait until then for me to say more on that.” A second tranche of fixed penalty notices was issued by the Metropolitan police’s Operation Hillman team on Tuesday, with Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, each having to pay £50 for attending an illegal celebration for the prime minister’s birthday. Johnson’s allies have downplayed the seriousness of the breach, saying he was present only for nine minutes and that it was not a planned event. However, Johnson was challenged over whether he would resign if he was handed fresh fines by Scotland Yard. “I redirect you to what I said earlier on, I’m afraid that won’t give you any particular surprise,” the prime minister told the Guardian. “I said quite a lot about this earlier in the week. I think I should wait until parliament gets back to update parliament fully.” Johnson is likely to face a barrage of questions when he makes a statement to the Commons next week, including over the suggestion he may have misled parliament by assuring MPs on 1 December that “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. The date of the full publication of the Sue Gray report also remains unclear, given the Met’s ongoing investigation is preventing the senior civil servant put in charge of the Partygate inquiry from releasing details of the dozens of interviews and evidence gathered by her team. So far only a small number of Tory MPs have gone public with their concerns about the fines. Karen Bradley, the former Northern Ireland secretary, became the latest to heap pressure on Johnson. Speaking to her local news website, StokeonTrentLive, she said: “My constituents know that I have been clear that those that make the rules must not break them, whether intentionally or otherwise. The public are right to expect the highest standards of behaviour from their leaders. “I am proud of the British values of democracy, individual liberty, mutual respect, tolerance and the rule of law and have been privileged to promote those values around the world as an MP and during my time as a government minister. But we will lose the right to promote those values if we do not uphold them ourselves.” She added: “Whilst law-breaking in Downing Street is unforgivable, I am very aware that Europe is in a precarious position and that we all need to act responsibly so as to not make the situation worse. “I will spend the next few days consulting my constituents and will decide on what action to take after listening to them. But I do wish to make it clear that if I had been a minister found to have broken the laws that I passed, I would be tendering my resignation now.” Bradley follows the Conservative MPs Nigel Mills and Craig Whittaker in criticising Johnson for breaking Covid rules, as well as a justice minister, David Wolfson, who quit on Wednesday night. The home secretary, Priti Patel, who has been far more muted in her defence of the prime minister given her role covers law and order, gave her first public comments since the fines were issued. During a trip to Rwanda she said she would not “give a running commentary as there’s an investigation ongoing”, but that Johnson had “given a very thorough and fulsome apology and should be respected for that”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson refuses to say whether he will resign over Covid fines,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/14/boris-johnson-refuses-to-say-whether-he-will-resign-over-covid-fines
4/14/2022,"The Gambling Commission is to lay down tougher rules for the industry in Great Britain after becoming exasperated by the ongoing failure of online casinos and bookmakers to protect vulnerable people and addicts. In a major shift in emphasis, the regulator will start giving operators direct instructions on how to ensure that consumers aren’t harmed, taking a prescriptive approach, instead of leaving it up to them to decide how to do so. The Gambling Commission chief executive, Andrew Rhodes, said the regulator had been forced to act because firms were “not doing enough”, despite the imminent threat of a government review of gambling laws that could lead to stricter regulation. William Hill recently revealed that it had set aside £15m to cover potential costs arising from a review of its licence by the Gambling Commission. If the regulator were to fine the bookmaker that much, it would be the highest penalty ever levied against a British operator. Online casino 888, which is in the process of buying William Hill, was fined £9.4m last month over multiple failings that led to customers racking up huge losses during the depths of the Covid pandemic. Rhodes said the regulator’s more prescriptive approach would leave firms in no doubt about what they need to do to avoid facing more penalties, the volume of which has risen significantly in recent years. “Time and time again our enforcement cases show that some operators are still not doing enough to prevent gambling harm,” said Rhodes. “These new rules, developed following an extensive consultation, make our expectations even more explicit.” “We expect operators to identify and tackle gambling harms with fast, proportionate and effective action and we will not hesitate to take tough action on operators who fail to do so.” Under the new rules, bookies and online casinos will be required to monitor a specific range of indicators that a customer is suffering harm due to their gambling, flag worrying signs and take action quickly. They will also have to put in place measures to stop themselves marketing bonus offers for customers deemed to be at risk of gambling disorder. The Gambling Commission will expect them to provide regular evidence of their progress. It plans to issue guidance on how to comply in June, before the rules come into effect on 12 September. The Guardian has approached the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), the lobby group for the industry, for comment.",News/Society,Gambling firms in Great Britain to face tougher rules on preventing harm,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/gambling-commission-british-firms-tougher-rules-on-preventing-harm
4/14/2022,"Britain’s biggest banks say they expect a rise in the number of consumers struggling to repay credit cards and other loans amid growing concern over soaring living costs. Figures from the Bank of England show that high street lenders expect an increase in the number of defaults on unsecured lending and business loans over the three months to the end of June. The details from its quarterly “credit conditions” survey of the UK’s biggest banks and credit card providers showed expectations of an increase in demand for consumer borrowing in the months ahead. However, it also suggested lenders were not concerned about losses despite the anticipated rise in default rates. Paul Heywood, the chief data and analytics officer at Equifax UK, the consumer credit agency, said the figures reflected a worsening situation that had been developing for several months. “Significant portions of the UK population are falling into financial difficulty, with families at the lower end of the income scale being hardest hit. The pressures of the cost of living crisis are pushing up demand for credit, especially in the unsecured lending and credit card spaces, while the same inflationary pressures, along with rising interest rates, are quelling demand for discretionary borrowing,” he said. Official figures showed UK inflation soared to 7% in March, the highest rate since 1992, while economists have said the measure for the annual jump in the cost of living is likely to breach 9% this month, the highest since 1982, during Margaret Thatcher’s first government. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates when its monetary policy committee meets early next month, with the inflation rate now more than three times its official target of 2%. Although average wage growth has picked up in recent months, it is failing to keep pace with soaring inflation, and is expected to contribute to the biggest squeeze on household disposable income since records began in the 1950s. Wealthier households managed to save billions of pounds between them during the pandemic as lockdown kept people away from shops and stopped them taking overseas holidays. However, poorer families endured a bigger financial hit, and are expected to bear the brunt of the cost of living emergency this year. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at the financial platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said borrowing was likely get more difficult in the coming months. “Demand for loans and credit cards boomed at the start of this year. With inflation gathering momentum, and eye-watering price rises for many of the essentials, it has forced more of us to borrow to make ends meet.” Credit card borrowing jumped by £1.5bn in February to £59.5bn, the highest since records began in 1993, stoking concern that low-income households were turning to expensive forms of lending to cope with the rising cost of food, clothing and fuel. Economists have said the cost of living squeeze will drag down consumer spending later this year, weighing on the economic recovery from Covid. However, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Thursday indicated little reduction in appetite for spending so far. The ONS said UK credit and debit card spending showed a slight increase of 2 percentage points over the seven days to 4 April, including an increase in delayable and social spending.",News/Business,High street banks warn of rise in UK customers defaulting on loans,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/high-street-banks-warn-of-rise-in-uk-customers-defaulting-on-loans
4/14/2022,"It’s incredible what producers can get away with on reality TV if it is done under the guise of a “social experiment”. Ever since Big Brother’s early noughties launch, the term has been used to evade scrutiny, but as the genre’s offerings get more bizarre and difficult to defend, it’s a claim that’s increasingly made. Some of the most outrageous shows have justified their existence this way. We’ve seen pseudoscience rationalise the exploratory marriages of The Spouse House, which puts 14 singles into accelerated relationships for eight weeks in the hopes of leaving the mansion engaged. Married at First Sight described its gimmick of having couples meet for the first time at the altar as a “groundbreaking experiment”. And the supposed justification of Love Is Blind, which has taken the world by storm over the past few years? According to its description on Netflix, contestants talk to each other and even get engaged without ever seeing the other person, all in the name of a “social experiment”. It is all done in the name of drama, as opposed to enlightenment. Netflix’s new show takes it a step further – by meddling in pre-existing relationships. A more surreal series from the creators of Love Is Blind, The Ultimatum: Marry or Move on – which features the same presenting duo of Nick and Vanessa Lachey – is described as “a new social experiment that pushes relationships to the next level.” We follow six couples at a crossroads – one partner has issued an ultimatum, another is unsure about the future of their relationship. Over two months, the pairs will date people from the other couples (largely in front of their partners) to determine whether they will stay together or go their separate ways. Something about it feels particularly brazen. A lot of shows include soundbites from a TV psychologist or a panel of “experts” as part of the ruse, but The Ultimatum doesn’t even bother. In fact, it comes closer than any other series in being honest about its setup catering more to the audience than the couples. Not long into the first episode, Nick offers participants and viewers a don’t-try-this-at-home disclaimer: “Psychologists agree that an ultimatum is not a good way to get somebody else to do what you want.” Finally, some honesty! His wife, Vanessa, briefly counters this with the fact that an ultimatum worked for her when she levelled one at him and they subsequently broke up, dated other people, got back together and married. But it is still a mask-off moment, an admission of what we all know; the phrase “experiment” allows them to get away with an absolutely ludicrous premise, but the audience rarely buys into it as an explanation any more. The Ultimatum is not the first show to encourage contestants to ruin their relationships in the name of pop psychology. In 2019, Singletown took five UK couples and had them spend the summer dating as singletons, watching their other half’s shenanigans on-screen. US show Temptation Island has several couples agree to live with a group of singles of the opposite sex, in order to test the strength of their relationships – including frequent video rundowns of what their partner is getting up to. These shows are especially addictive because of the high stakes. Watching couples destroy their relationships leaves you asking, mouth agape: “Why?” The answer is the same as it is in much of reality TV; manipulation. In an interview with Bustle, Temptation Island’s showrunner Scott Jeffress said that couples often believe the quacks who assure them that the show will save their union. “Any couple that comes on and says, ‘There’s no way we’ll break up, we’re in love,’ I say, bring it on,” Jeffress said. “This is a way to really test the relationship. If you truly are a match, you’ll walk away together. Usually, they buy in and say: ‘We need to try it.’” Doing so can lead to devastating consequences. Before the second episode of The Ultimatum is over, there are already tears of regret and confessions from contestants that they should have thought twice. With all the bed-hopping and saliva-swapping, you can’t help but think contestants would have been better off looking into polyamory, as in the Channel 4 show Open House: The Great Sex Experiment. Across six episodes, couples hole up in a luxury retreat to explore whether having open relationships and sex with other people can strengthen their relationship. Its “experiment” credentials are strengthened by intimacy therapist Dr Lori Beth Bisbey, who provides support and advice on how to open relationships safely and healthily. Yet it still just feels like an excuse to watch people have threesomes on telly. Truly, the greatest trick the TV gods ever pulled was convincing couples to self-sabotage their relationships in the name of science. Even though couples might believe the shows have their best interests at heart, the rest of us do not. Producers need to realise something: “experiment” is a description of these shows that rings as true as Love Islanders saying they’re on the show to find that special someone.",Arts/Television & radio,Destroying relationships in science’s name: how reality TV ‘experiments’ wreck lives,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/14/destroying-relationships-in-sciences-name-how-reality-tv-experiments-wreck-lives
4/14/2022,"Manchester United were apparently put off by Antonio Conte’s style and short spells at his previous clubs but the Italian’s relentless nature is bringing the best out of Spurs – as a team and individuals – to put them in the driving seat for Champions League qualification. Since he arrived at Tottenham things have not always gone smoothly but the hard work on the training ground is paying off. They have won six of their past seven league games during a crucial spell. Spurs have scored more Premier League goals than any other team since the turn of the year and become less reliant on Harry Kane. Before Conte’s appointment, Spurs were bottom of the table when it came to ground covered. The key to all Conte’s work is making the squad fitter because without that his methods do not work. By all accounts he is working the players harder in training than his predecessor, Nuno Espírito Santo, to fit them into his preferred 3-4-3. When I was at Chelsea I would see Conte at the training ground and he was relentless with players as he tried to make the shape right and find areas for individuals to improve. Kane is thriving under Conte; in the league he has scored 12 goals this season and created another eight, with only one goal and one assist coming under Nuno. Like his teammates, Kane appears fitter, which has reinvigorated him after a long season when you factor in the Euros. His role has not necessarily changed because he has always liked to drop deep to make the most of his passing range, but now his teammates can keep going beyond him. It is no longer just Son Heung-min doing that, meaning Kane has greater options when he finds pockets of space. That takes the pressure off him, something reflected in his performances. Spurs’ most consistent forwards have been aided by the winter signing of Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus. He is the player they have been crying out for because Steven Bergwijn, Lucas Moura and Gareth Bale have tried to fill the role but failed to produce on a regular basis. The Sweden international has fitted in well and formed an understanding with Son and Kane to reach three goals and six assists in 11 league games. Whereas Tottenham’s rivals carried out limited January transfer business, Conte let four leave and although the club signed only Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur it has paid off. Kulusevski is young and they have options to buy for as little as €30m. It is part of the business model to buy a top player for a good price, like they did with Son, and gives them time to develop him into the player they want with two top individuals in Kane and Son alongside him. There are few better at bringing about immediate improvements out of players than Conte. Look at Romelu Lukaku: he took him to Internazionale after it was obvious the Belgian was not wanted at Manchester United and made him into a striker who scored 64 goals in two seasons and was sold for £97.5m. At Spurs, he has turned Matt Doherty from a player who could not get into matchday squads under José Mourinho into a major part of his system until injury at Aston Villa last Saturday ended Doherty’s season. In 2022, Doherty has two league goals and four assists and has looked to be back to the player he was at Wolves. Going out of the Europa Conference League and FA Cup will have helped Conte because he needed time on the training ground to make the squad used to his methods. Resting players for matches on a Thursday is useful but it does mean their training week will be disrupted because a different starting XI is put into shape. Fewer games to concentrate on is better because having a full week to overload the players to get them fit and sharp allows them to peak for one match. It enables them to build preparation into that game and means there can be no excuses, and you can see that coming through. At one point it did not look as if Conte would revitalise Spurs and he implied he was willing to leave after their defeat at Burnley in late February. Conte said “maybe I am not so good”, although he has plenty of evidence to the contrary. I do not know why he said it – maybe he wanted to put pressure on the club’s hierarchy – but it seems to have worked given that the football and results have been better since. It shows he knows how to push buttons on and off the pitch. Spurs have made themselves favourites for fourth spot. Manchester United are in terrible form, Arsenal have lost their past two games, to Crystal Palace and Brighton, and West Ham’s results have dipped while juggling the Premier League and Europa League. Spurs have a north London derby to come – a home game on 12 May – and I think they will secure Champions League qualification. Of the four managers vying for fourth place, Conte is the one I would want in my dressing room, without a doubt. Spurs have form in their favour and the stamina to complete the job, all thanks to Conte proving once again that his methods work.",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte is working his magic at Spurs and it all stems from fitness | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/antonio-conte-magic-spurs-fitness-favourites-fourth-place
4/14/2022,"Rightwing populist parties have a detrimental impact on climate policy, researchers have found for the first time, amid growing fears of a similar movement in the UK. The study, by the universities of Sussex and Warwick, looked at the policy of more than 25 countries over a period of more than a decade. Researchers created a climate policy index and compared it with a baseline of a centre-right government. They found the combined effect of the presence of a rightwing populist party in parliament and in government was associated with a reduction in the index of about 25% on average. But while rightwing populist parties had a negative impact on climate policy across the board, EU membership and proportional representation voting systems lessened the effect. The study’s authors, Dr Matthew Lockwood and Dr Ben Lockwood, wrote: “These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that in countries with proportional representation, where rightwing populist parties enter government they will do so as typically junior coalition partners with limited numbers of cabinet seats and a tendency not to prioritise portfolios relevant to climate policy. “By contrast, in countries with majoritarian electoral systems, when rightwing populist parties get into government, our finding is that they have a much greater influence on climate policy.” Examples of rightwing populists reversing climate policies include Donald Trump, who pulled the US out of the Paris agreement and gave support for coal. In Australia, Tony Abbott repealed that country’s carbon price. Matthew Lockwood, from the University of Sussex, said populist parties were a growing concern, owing to the cost of living crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war. “The thing about rightwing populist parties is they tend to be very reactive to crisis,” he said. “In Europe, a lot of that has been on immigration, and in the UK it has been Brexit. And these issues have gone off the boil a bit so the people who were pushing for Brexit are now in the net zero scrutiny group. It’s the same people reacting to a crisis but now pushing against climate action.” There are fears that the risk is greater in post-Brexit Britain if those who wish to delay climate action become a louder voice in government. Lockwood said: “The risk is bigger – Britain is outside the EU, we have the same sort of electoral system as places like Canada, Australia, [the] US. If a more climate-sceptic or hostile faction takes hold in the Conservative party, then that’s going to be a lot more damaging than if it happened to countries in Europe with proportional representation.” However, he believes that the UK will not necessarily end up in a similar position to other countries with right-wing populist governments. “There’s something about the history of the Conservative party that has made it more resistant to these views than the populists in Australia and US,” he said. “Look how many MPs are in the Conservative Environment Network – so I’m not saying it’s bound to happen, but we are at risk.” The Netherlands 2010 – the populist and climate-sceptic PVV party got its best ever electoral result and came in as a junior coalition partner in a centre-right led government. The scale and ambition of greenhouse gas emissions reduction and renewable energy targets set by the previous government were reduced, and a coal phaseout remained off the agenda. Norway 2013 – the populist Progress party entered a minority government. Previous centre-left coalition governments had had ambitious climate policy, but again targets for emissions reduction and renewables were reduced. The Progress party took over the ministry of petroleum and energy and issued new drilling licences for oil, including in the Arctic for the first time. Denmark 2015 – the centre-right Venstre party formed a minority government that had informal support from the populist Danish Peoples’ party, which got 21% of the vote, its best ever share. There was backsliding on emissions reduction and renewables targets, and the goal of phasing out coal set by the previous government was dropped. Poland 2015 – the populist PiS took power as the largest party in a coalition government. In its first term it was hostile to renewables, blocking onshore wind and opposing expansion of renewable energy targets at the EU level. It also blocked the 2050 carbon neutrality goal in the European Council. However, from 2019 the party changed position on renewables. Austria 2017 – the populist FPÖ came in as a junior partner in a centre-right led government. The FPÖ had little impact in the end but voted against Austria joining the Paris Agreement and against parliament declaring a climate emergency in 2019.",News/Environment,"Rightwing populist parties blight climate policy, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/14/rightwing-populist-parties-blight-climate-policy-study-finds
4/14/2022,"There are no-hitters. There are perfect games. And there’s the sort of virtuosity that Rōki Sasaki managed to conjure for two and a half unforgettable hours on Sunday afternoon at the Zozo Marine Stadium outside Tokyo. Sasaki, a right-handed flamethrower for the Chiba Lotte Marines of Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball, achieved one of his sport’s rarest feats when he retired the minimum 27 batters without allowing an opposing player to reach base in a 6-0 win over the Orix Buffaloes, racking up a record-tying 19 strikeouts in only 105 pitches. Even more remarkable: he’s still only 20 and grew up amid the wreckage of the 2011 tsunami after his house, and several family members, were swept away by the floodwaters. It was only the 16th perfect game in NPB history and the first in 28 years, but somehow that manages to undersell the grade of Sasaki’s masterpiece. There’s sabermetric-backed reason to believe that Sunday’s silencing of the defending Pacific League champions may well be the greatest game ever pitched. After coaxing a pair of groundouts to open the game, Sasaki whiffed two-time reigning Pacific League batting champion Masataka Yoshida for his first strikeout of the day. He then struck out the side in the second, third, fourth and fifth innings to set a record with 13 consecutive strikeouts, laying waste to the 64-year-old Japanese mark of nine. (No pitcher in Major League Baseball has ever fanned more than 10 in a row.) Sasaki continued to breeze through the Orix lineup into the later innings, overpowering hitters with a fastball that averaged nearly 100mph while keeping them guessing with a devastating low-90s splitter that drops off the table right as it reaches home plate. Every pitch called by catcher Kō Matsukawa, an 18-year-old fresh out of high school, the imperious Sasaki calmly whipped past the flailing Buffaloes. He struck out the side once more in the eighth and then, down to the last batter, Sasaki uncoiled his beanpole frame for the 105th and final time and fooled the reigning Pacific League home run king Yutaro Sugimoto with a diving forkball for his 19th strikeout, equalling the NPB single-game record and setting off a wild celebration near the pitcher’s mound. “This is the greatest,” a beaming Sasaki told Japan’s Kyodo news agency in the aftermath. “Honestly, I wasn’t thinking about the possibility [of a perfect game]. I figured it would be OK if I gave up a hit, so I just pitched and put my trust in Matsukawa right until the end.” Roki Sasaki attributes his historic perfect game to his 18-year-old catcher, Kou Matsukawa pic.twitter.com/qJgwCK3L1b It’s been some journey for Sasaki, whose father and grandparents were killed and house swept away in the Tōhoku tsunami that engulfed Japan’s north-east coast when he was in elementary school. It’s a tragedy that, understandably, has stayed with him. “It’s been 11 years but I cannot easily erase the agony and sadness I felt at the time,” Sasaki said last month. “I’ve been able to dedicate myself to baseball thanks to the support I’ve had. I only have the sense of gratitude to those who supported me.” Courted by scouts from at least 20 of Major League Baseball’s 30 teams during a headline-grabbing career at Ofunato High School, he opted to sign with the Marines, who selected him first overall in the October amateur draft ahead of the 2020 season. He didn’t make an appearance during his first year with the club while on “physical preparation” – a rarity for a No 1 pick that made him a target for critics – but went 3-2 with 68 strikeouts, 16 walks and a 2.27 earned run average in 11 appearances during his debut campaign last year. And now this: the first perfect game in NPB since Hiromi Makihara of the Yomiuri Giants on 18 May 1994. His sudden rise to international fame after Sunday’s contest – Sasaki’s name (#佐々木朗希) was trending on Twitter globally for several hours in the aftermath – comes at a moment when Japanese players are breaking through in the US mainstream like seldom before. This week Shohei Ohtani, the two-way LA Angels star with the once-in-a-century skillset who captured last year’s AL Most Valuable Player honors, became the first baseball player in nearly two decades to appear on the cover of Time magazine. And Seiya Suzuki, the longtime Hiroshima Toyo Carp outfielder who joined the Chicago Cubs on a five-year, $85m contract in March, is off to a historically torrid start in one of America’s biggest markets. Sasaki, who hails from the same Iwate Prefecture as Ohtani, will no doubt have US fans drooling in anticipation of whether he will follow suit. But thanks to the byzantine posting system in place between MLB and NPB, which effectively deters the world’s best players from coming to the US as soon as possible, they could be in for a long wait. Japanese players who sign with NPB clubs must accrue nine years of professional experience before they can sign as international free agents on the open market. A caveat to the system would allow Sasaki to come over as many as three years sooner, but he won’t be able to maximize his earnings until he turns 25 or finishes his sixth season in Japan. Bottom line: unless he’s willing to play for under fair market value, and that’s presuming the Marines oblige his request to be posted early, it’s unlikely his Major League Baseball debut will happen before 2027. But while MLB fans are left to daydream about the future, Sasaki is focused on what he can produce now. “The reality is slowly starting to sink in. I spent last night immersing myself in the experience,” he said on Monday. “That mark in history will always stand. A player is expected to perform throughout the season so I’m shifting gears and moving on.”",Sport/Sport,Rōki Sasaki: the 20-year-old tsunami survivor behind the greatest game ever pitched,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/roki-sasaki-perfect-game-japanese-pitcher
4/14/2022,"MPs and a human rights group have called on the UK government to repatriate a young British boy and his gravely ill mother from a detention camp in Syria, after doctors said she was at risk of dying and leaving the child orphaned. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was reviewing the case of Zaid* and his mother, Maryam* – who was injured in an explosion in Syria in 2019 and left with shrapnel in her head – “as a matter of priority”. However, despite multiple requests over several months to repatriate the family, no action has been taken. Maryam’s condition has continued to worsen and she is unlikely to survive without medical intervention, according to doctors. At least 30 British children remain in Syrian detention camps in dangerous and squalid conditions, despite warnings from MPs that there was “compelling evidence” that women and children had been trafficked. Most of the women and children in the camps were captured by Syrian Kurdish fighters, ground troops in the US-led coalition against the terror group, when fleeing IS territory after the fall of Baghouz in 2019. Al-Hawl and Roj camps in north-east Syria hold 60,000 people; half of those in detention are children aged 10 years or younger. According to Save the Children, at least 163 people died in the camps in 2021, 62 of whom were children. Last year, Danish intelligence confirmed that at least 30 children from the camps had been kidnapped and trafficked by IS, formerly known as Isis. A report out this week highlighted the worsening conditions inside the so-called “widow camps”, saying “children … have been found to be severely neglected, abused and forced to work, while mothers are at ‘breaking point’ psychologically.” The human rights charity Reprieve has been working on multiple cases of British children living in dangerous conditions in the camps, including that of Zaid, whose age cannot be given in order to protect his identity. Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, who visited the pair, said Maryam’s tent was recently set alight and Zaid was forced to drag his mother out to save them both. Arson is a common occurrence as IS followers try to break out of the camps, though there are also often accidents with stoves. The young boy now “sees fires everywhere”, and remains on constant alert, said Foa. “He refuses to play outside with other children as he is afraid that if he leaves his mother’s side, she might die.” Andrew Mitchell, Conservative MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on trafficked Britons in Syria, told the Guardian: “The government’s position is surely hard to fathom. Ministers are asking us to believe that this British woman who can barely walk is such a threat to national security that she cannot be brought back home for life-saving medical treatment with her young son. “Has the UK really become so fearful and so cruel? I urge the government not to risk making an orphan of a young British boy and bring this family home.” Last week, Germany repatriated 27 children and eight mothers from north-east Syria and in February, the Netherlands repatriated 11 children and five mothers. The UK has so far repatriated seven children but no women. The Foreign Office responded to a request for comment on Zaid’s case by saying: “There may be British children in internally displaced persons camps in Syria who are innocent victims of the conflict. Where we become aware of unaccompanied or orphaned British children in Syria, we will work to facilitate their return, subject to national security considerations.” This amounts to a policy of separating children from their mothers, argues APPG co-chair, Apsana Begum. “By choosing to separate British children from their mothers, the government is putting these women in a situation that no parent should ever have to face,” the Labour MP told the Guardian. “The fact that the government would adopt this brutish approach to tear British families apart shows everything that’s wrong with its counter-productive and unbearably callous policy towards British nationals in north-east Syria.” During the pandemic, eight children aged under five died within days of each other as humanitarian organisations’ access to the camps was reduced. Their deaths were linked to conditions such as heart failure, internal bleeding and severe malnutrition, and could have been treated. Although the government claims to assess each repatriation request on a case-by-case basis, letters with similar wording have been sent to British mothers refusing to assist them. “These letters suggest a blanket policy of offering to separate mothers from their children – something the government has previously said is wrong,” said Foa. “Any child psychologist would tell you this is incredibly damaging and the policy is also totally out of step with our international partners.” In a statement for the Guardian, Maryam’s family said: “The UK government can easily repatriate them and save their lives if they wanted. But instead, every day we expect a call telling us the worst has happened. We feel completely helpless and just want them home where we know they are safe.” Last month, more than 8,000 Reprieve supporters wrote to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, asking the government to repatriate Zaid and his mother so that she could receive the urgent medical care that she needs. * Names have been changed",News/Global development,MPs call for British child and ill mother to be returned to UK from Syrian camp,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/14/mps-call-for-british-child-and-ill-mother-to-be-returned-to-uk-from-syrian-camp

We agree that climate change is a big issue, but her solution to this – her solution to a lot of things – is to be independent from Westminster. She expressed herself well, but I don’t think it’s enough. She thinks Scottish independence will be a fresh start where we can create a better world. I’m a bit of a grumpy cynic: I think we should be trying to fix the system we’ve got. Emily One of the things I loved about chatting to her was that it wasn’t a conversation where each person had a portfolio of figures to cite. The amount of oil left in the North Sea varies according to what argument it’s being used for. She’s worried about the climate crisis, whereas I think there’s also significant fuel poverty in this country, which we could address better. Grace I’m of the opinion that the SNP is a populist party that will swing towards whatever will win it votes, and its policies are often more rightwing than people think. But she had some good points about its more socialist side, which I tend to ignore. Emily Our other big contention was Brexit: where the threshold should be. She thinks a referendum would have been less divisive if you made it at least 60:40 to pass. Which I don’t think is a good idea – it should be 50%.

4/14/2022,"After a virtual event in 2020 and a scaled-down festival last year, the 75th Cannes film festival has announced a lineup packed full of previous Palme d’Or winners and festival favourites for what it hopes will be a return to full capacity – and maximum buzz. New films from Ruben Östlund, Hirokazu Kore-eda , Cristian Mungiu, Michel Hazanavicius and the Dardenne brothers – all of whom have already triumphed at the festival – will play in competition. Meanwhile, Croisette favourites such as David Cronenberg, Claire Denis, Park Chan-wook and James Gray will also vie for the prize. No British directors have so far been announced as having films which will play in either the official competition selection or the sidebars. But at least one film is set in the UK: Silent Twins, which stars Letitia Wright and Tamara Lawrance as June and Jennifer Gibbons, twins from the only Black family in a small town in Wales in the 1970s who are sent to Broadmoor after a crime spree. Only three of the 21 directors with films in competition are female, meaning the festival is falling far short of the gender parity pledge it signed in 2018. The festival will open on a gory note, with a French remake of acclaimed Japanese zombie film One Cut of the Dead by the director of The Artist. Hazanavicius’s Final Cut stars Romain Duris, Bérénice Bejo and Bejo and Hazanavicius’s daughter, Simone. The horror theme continues with Crimes of the Future, Cronenberg’s visceral body-chopping sci-fi about the future of human evolution. Viggo Mortensen plays a notorious avant garde artist who, along with his partner (Léa Seydoux), “publicly showcases the metamorphosis of his organs in avant garde performances”. Kristen Stewart is an investigator from the National Organ Registry who makes an uncomfortable discovery. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Broker is set in a world in which infants can be placed in baby boxes and dropped off anonymously to be cared for by others, while in Decision to Leave, Park Chan-wook directs the story of a detective who falls for a mysterious widow. Cristian Mungiu, whose abortion drama 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days won the Palme d’Or in 2007 returns to the festival with RMN, a long-awaited multi-strand drama set in contemporary Romania. Two-time Palme d’Or winners Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne return with Tori and Lokita, about two African refugees whose friendship is tested when they settle in Belgium. Joe Alwyn and Margaret Qualley play a couple struggling to escape the Nicaraguan Revolution in The Stars at Noon, a romantic thriller from Claire Denis. Triangle of Sadness, the latest film from Force Majeure director Ruben Östlund is a social satire about a group of celebrity fashionistas shipwrecked on a desert island along with their yacht’s Marxist captain (Woody Harrelson) and crew. Two US directors have made the cut: James Gray, whose autobiographical drama Armageddon Time about his childhood in Queens stars Anne Hathaway, Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Strong; and Kelly Reichardt, back with her fourth collaboration with Michelle Williams. Showing Up is billed as a “sharply funny portrait of an artist on the verge of a career-changing exhibition”. Judd Hirsch co-stars. Out of competition, documentaries include Ethan Coen’s study of Jerry Lee Lewis and The Natural History of Destruction, the third film by Ukrainian film-maker Sergei Loznitsa dealing with the tragedies of 20th-century European history. Previously announced is a Tom Cruise career retrospective, as well as the premiere of the belated sequel Top Gun: Maverick. The film will premiere just over a week before it opens in the US. Cruise, who turns 60 shortly after the festival at the end of May, will discuss his 40-year career at an in-conversation audience on the Croisette. Cannes’ fond relationship with blockbusters hit a peak around seven years ago with the premiere of George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road, which won rave reviews before winning six Oscars the following spring. Miller’s follow-up to that film, Three Thousand Years of Longing, starring Tilda Swinton and Idris Elba, will also screen for the first time at the festival. Nine years ago, Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby opened Cannes, repeating the trick of Moulin Rouge in 2001. This year sees the stage set for the first screening of Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley biopic, starring Austin Butler as the singer and Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker. Notable firsts elsewhere in the lineup include Saim Sadiq’s Joyland, the first film from Pakistan to make the official selection, which plays in Un Certain Regard.

4/14/2022,"Moscow has said it will be forced to strengthen its defences in the Baltic if Finland and Sweden join Nato, including by deploying nuclear weapons, as the war in Ukraine entered its seventh week. The former president Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said on Thursday that Russia would bolster all its forces in the region if the two Nordic countries joined the US-led alliance. Finland and Sweden are deliberating whether to abandon decades of military non-alignment and join Nato, with the two Nordic countries’ leaders saying Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape”. Their accession to the alliance would more than double Russia’s land border with Nato members, Medvedev said. “Naturally, we will have to reinforce these borders” by bolstering ground, air and naval defences in the region, he said. Medvedev, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, explicitly raised the nuclear threat, saying Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would mean there could be “no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic: the balance must be restored”. Russia had “not taken such measures, and was not going to”, he said. “But if our hand is forced, well … take note it wasn’t us who proposed this.” Russia borders the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia, and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday that Finland, which shares a 1,300km (810-mile) border with Russia, was likely to decide on a Nato application “within weeks”, while her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said there was “no point delaying” the decision. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russian forces, which have pulled back from northern Ukraine after failing to take the capital, were “increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats”. The deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar said on Thursday that Russia was massing troops along the Russia-Ukraine border, in Belarus and in the breakaway Transdniestria region of Moldova, with the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia coming under missile attack. The US unveiled a new military aid package, including armoured personnel carriers and helicopters, saying it was seeking to provide Ukraine with weapons that would give them “more range and distance” before the anticipated attack. Moscow said on Thursday that its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, had been “seriously damaged” by an explosion that the defence ministry said was caused by ammunition detonating “as a result of a fire”. Ukraine said the cruiser had been hit by a missile. Although the defence ministry later said the fire had been put out, news of the loss overshadowed Russian claims of advances in the devastated southern port city of Mariupol, largely reduced to rubble by a brutal six-week bombardment that the local mayor has said killed more than 21,000 civilians. Russia claimed on Wednesday that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered in the city, adding later that the port was under its full control. But Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Thursday the battle over the seaport was “still ongoing today”. Mariupol is a key target in Moscow’s push to secure a land corridor between the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas and Crimea, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014, and its capture would allow the Kremlin’s military planners to redeploy vital resources farther east. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said nine humanitarian corridors had been agreed to evacuate civilians, including by private car, from Mariupol, Berdiansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar, on Thursday, with others in Luhansk expected to open if Russian forces stopped shelling. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Hague-based international criminal court, which deals with rights abuses, told reporters Ukraine had become a “crime scene”. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said on a visit to Bucha, where officials say more than 400 civilians died: “We’re here because we have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed.” Moscow has rejected all reports of atrocities, which Putin has dismissed as “fakes”. Russia’s invasion has so far driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, more than 4.6 million of whom have fled abroad. Western sanctions have triggered Russia’s worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, analysts say. More than 600 western companies have pulled out of country.",News/World news,Russia warns of nuclear weapons in Baltic if Sweden and Finland join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/russia-says-it-will-reinforce-borders-if-sweden-and-finland-join-nato

It features nothing more than a beat, a mournful piano figure, a weeping violin and the 21-year-old rapper’s voice, relating a blend of aggressive street-level reportage, stuff about his dealings with the police – of which more later – and suggestions that what he really wants is true love. It ends with him comparing himself to the biggest stars in the UK rap firmament, then considering his own commercial prospects. “I’m as hard as Stormzy and Dave, what a statement to make, but I say what I say and I mean it,” he offers. “But you will not agree and say I’m too in these streets and the act that I got I should clean it.” Then he adds a final, valedictory “fuck you”. You can see why he might respond that way: Digga D isn’t, at this point, at the platinum-selling level of Stormzy and Dave, but he’s doing pretty well for himself. A string of gold and silver singles; a previous mixtape, Made In the Pyrex, that got to No 3 in the album chart; enough clout to get big-name American rappers as guests on Noughty By Nature (B-Lovee drops a thrillingly raw-throated verse on What You Reckon, while Moneybagg Yo takes time out from releasing US chart-topping albums to appear on G Lock). Moreover, he has achieved this under extraordinary circumstances. In 2018, Digga D and the other members of drill group 1011 were subject to an unprecedented criminal behaviour order that prevents him from inciting violence, mentioning certain areas of London or making references to real-life people or incidents in his lyrics. The BBC documentary Defending Digga D showed the effects: a rapper on the phone to his lawyer, running through tracks line by line, trying to work out if saying “jump out, try and put him in a coffin” is going to put him back in jail. That said, the attention of the Met doesn’t seem to have altered Digga D’s approach much: even Noughty By Nature’s poppiest moment and solitary love song, Hold It Down, is couched in terms involving showing undying devotion through perjury and waiting until prison sentences are completed. He’s audibly a fan of 50 Cent: What You Reckon borrows its samples from his 2005 hit Best Friend; Hold It Down is based around 21 Questions; Pump 101’s title, beat and chorus are all derived from G-Unit’s Stunt 101. And if 50 Cent’s career tells you anything, it’s that the kind of trouble that would seem career-limiting in other lines of work can often have the opposite effect. 50 Cent, after all, went from being blackballed by the music business for writing the kind of rhymes that could get a person and their associates shot, to selling 30m albums. From the start of Noughty By Nature, you’re up to your neck in cheffings, shanks and the boring up of opps, albeit with a variety of names and locations bleeped out. Whether that will do anything to stem crime in London is a moot point, but it certainly lends interest. If you’re so inclined, this is not just music but a puzzle to be solved – albeit fairly easily, as you don’t have to look too hard on the internet to find out who and where he’s talking about. There is also a wilful blurring of the line that separates reality from telling gritty stories. “Everything you hear me rapping about is all facts, nothing’s fabricated / This shit you hear me rapping about is all cap, everything’s exaggerated,” runs the album’s intro. The lyrical viewpoint of Alter Ego alternates between Digga D the rapper and Digga D the “trap boy”, still immersed in gang life. The violence could be wearying but his undeniably brilliant flow – nimble but punchy – invests it with drama. As you might expect given his love of 50 Cent, there’s occasionally a hint of early 00s hip-hop lushness about the album’s sound, not least on the concluding Maverick Sabre feature Let It Go, and Digga is clearly trying to expand beyond drill to encompass trap and even pop balladry. This is sometimes to the album’s detriment. Its most thrilling moments come when it sticks fast to drill’s minimal and now distinctively British blueprint, rather than looking back towards the US. Musically, the best thing here may be Stuck In the Mud, an object lesson in making a little go a long way: there’s almost nothing to its sound beyond a beat and a weird, thin brass sample that weaves unsteadily around the rhythm track to unsettling effect – drill with its tempo slowed but the penetrating bass and eerie atmosphere remaining. It doesn’t undermine his abundant artistry to suggest that unsettling people is at the root of Digga D’s success. An authentic whiff of danger, of parent-scaring notoriety, is a rare and potentially valuable commodity in 21st-century pop and rock music. This is a world of media training, relatably matey demeanours and pains being taken to say the right thing, where a desire not to cause offence – nor provoke even the faux-outrage that fuels some sections of social media – rules supreme. Under the circumstances, why would he follow the suggestion to clean up his act? Nothing about Noughty By Nature suggests he needs to, and nothing about it suggests his current success won’t grow. Say She She – Forget Me NotDebut from Brooklyn trio on the reliably great Colemine label, a fabulous song infused with the wonky post-disco spirit of early 80s NYC.",Arts/Music,Digga D: Noughty By Nature review – UK drill figurehead has a flow for the ages,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/14/digga-d-noughty-by-nature-review-uk-drill
4/14/2022,"If you want to satirise a power figure or a political movement, you automatically reach for Shakespeare. Theatrical history is littered with examples. In 1937, Orson Welles staged a modern-dress Julius Caesar that evoked the worlds of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. In 1941, Bertolt Brecht used Richard III as a template for his anti-Hitlerian The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui. In 1966, Barbara Garson’s MacBird! daringly suggested that Lyndon Johnson was a modern Macbeth implicated in the death of JFK. So it is hardly surprising that writers and directors turn to the Bard in depicting Donald Trump. The current example is Mike Bartlett’s The 47th at the Old Vic, which uses King Lear, Julius Caesar and Richards II and III to try and nail the Trump phenomenon: although highly ingenious, it is hardly likely to cause controversy. The opposite was the case when, in 2017, the New York Public Theater’s annual summer Shakespeare in the Park production was a Julius Caesar in which the tyrant was a blond-quiffed figure with a Slovenian-accented wife: a conspirator even argued that the Romans loved him so much that they would forgive him “if Caesar had stabbed their mothers on Fifth Avenue”. Such was the uproar over the assassination of the Trump-like Caesar that two of the Public Theater’s sponsors pulled their support. That production features prominently in a book by Jeffrey R Wilson unequivocally entitled Shakespeare and Trump. I can understand the temptation to look to the man from Stratford to explain the disruptive politician from Queens. My problem is that Trump lacks the reflectiveness, the rhetoric, the political acumen and the psychological complexity of Shakespeare’s tragic heroes and emblematic kings. When Bartlett wrote King Charles III, it was possible to believe that our future monarch would suffer the crises of conscience of his Shakespearean forebears. In the case of The 47th it requires all the skill of the brilliant Bertie Carvel to persuade us that Trump is a dramatically compelling protagonist. The more Bartlett’s Trump mimics the irony of Mark Antony or the demonism of Richard III, the more conscious you become of the gap between the politician and the prototype. Bartlett’s Trump is at his best when, still speaking blank verse, he attacks Kamala Harris for the Democrats’ failure to listen to people’s needs. “You speak to them like kids,” he tells her. “And not just kids but poorer, less good-looking / Trashy kids that you and your celebrities / All constant lecture from your raised pile.” That hits home. But, while Bartlett’s play is amusing and reads well, it struck me that the real Shakespearean parallel with Trump lies not among the kings and emperors but in the figure of Parolles in All’s Well That Ends Well: a hollow braggart who adopts a tone of leering curiosity towards women (“Are you meditating on virginity?” he asks Helena) and who lies his way out of trouble. So how do you dramatise Trump? Four years ago, Tony Kushner announced he was writing a play about him: having classified Trump as borderline psychotic, Kushner went on to say that “he really is very boring”, and so far nothing has emerged. My own hunch is that you either have to tackle Trump on his own terms – as a man who treats politics as a form of performance art – or you have to analyse the source of his appeal rather than the man himself. In the first category, I would place a Harold Pinter sketch, The Pres and an Officer, which was premiered as part of Jamie Lloyd’s season of short Pinter plays in 2018. In the sketch we saw an orange-complexioned, extravagantly coiffured Jon Culshaw, in a fit of pique, ordering the nuking of London under the mistaken impression it was the capital of France. The other method, of examining why people actually voted from Trump, was pursued by a number of writers in a show called Top Trumps staged by Theatre 503 in 2017. One particular piece by Christopher Adams was simply a verbatim interview with the writer’s mother on why she felt Trump would make her and the nation safer: Mark Lawson in his review said the piece should be taught on creative writing courses as an example of how to explore views with which the writer disagrees. But if any one play explained Trump’s America it was Lynn Nottage’s Sweat, written in 2015 before his election and set in a Pennsylvania rustbelt town in 2000. Through diligent research and careful listening, Nottage explored what she called “the American de-industrial revolution” and the anger and despair that greeted increasing unemployment and a steel firm’s proposal that everyone take a 60% pay cut to save the plant. Trump was never mentioned, but Nottage’s play did more than all the spoofs and satires to explain his electoral success. Shakespeare himself, of course, had a phrase for this process: “By indirections find directions out.” The 47th is at the Old Vic, London, until 28 May",Arts/Stage,Sad!

4/14/2022,"Female fans not being allowed inside stadiums has long been the overriding international image when it comes to women and football in Iran and unsurprisingly so. Just over two weeks ago a number of Iranian women tried to get into the Imam Reza Stadium in the north-eastern city of Mashhad to watch the men play their final 2022 World Cup qualifier against Lebanon. They could not see the game – the ban has largely been in place since not long after the 1979 revolution – and then, according to some reports, they were treated to pepper spray by security guards. Despite requests from Fifa, criticism from around the world and calls from the players, authorities have yet to budge. Now, though, Iranian women are competing around the world and aiming to change minds in Tehran. In January, the national team played at the Women’s Asian Cup, their first international tournament. The opening game produced a creditable 0-0 draw with India in Mumbai. A Covid outbreak meant the hosts withdrew from the competition and their results were voided. For Iran, it meant that only their 7-0 and 5-0 losses at the hands of the eventual winners, China, and Taiwan respectively will go down in the record books. There was more to it than mere scorelines however. The coach, Maryam Irandoost, is confident the more the women play competitively around Asia, and one day the world, the greater the push will be to introduce equality in the stands back home, where the regime has made the occasional gesture in allowing women inside only to backtrack soon after. “I have tried for years to change this,” she says. “Our girls qualifying for and playing in the Asian Cup has changed the beliefs of a lot of people in Iran and I think this barrier will disappear in the near future. “Going into stadiums is not only about watching the matches and not only about increasing the number of fans. It will also change the vision of women’s football in Iran.” Irandoost, born at the height of the revolution, days after Ayatollah Khomeini returned from exile in Paris to take power, was delighted with the performances in India. “I am not disappointed with the tournament at all,” she says. “Our girls have good potential technically. We have areas in which we have to work on but if there is the same kind of investment and infrastructure as there has been over the past year then we will be at the same level with the best teams in Asia in five or six years.” Given Iran are ranked 70 in the world, behind Fiji and Haiti, to match Japan, the 2011 World Cup winners, Australia and China by the end of the decade would be quite an achievement for a team only just getting going. “There is a gap of 50 years behind the best teams in the world,” Irandoost says, “but families here are very interested in football and this encourages girls to play.” Irandoost, whose father, Nosrat, was a professional player and now coaches the second-tier men’s club Malavan FC, estimates there are about 2,500 female players in the top league and local clubs. “There has never been money in female football but the grassroots game is becoming more and more professional. We have a good infrastructure. The interest in the last three or four years has increased significantly. In the past nine months, the federation has had a good plan and that helps us qualify for the Asian Cup.” She says the reasons for the federation’s recent investment and support are complicated. Footballing wise it makes sense because Iran wants to host international tournaments. Recent investment from Saudi Arabia in women’s football – its national team recently played its first international fixtures –has been noted and there is a feeling Iran has the talent to compete on the world and not just the Asian stage. The men do just that and are preparing for a third successive World Cup and a group containing England and the United States in Qatar. “It is hard to say which team will advance but our men’s national team have always shown that they can face bigger teams and get good results.” Irandoost says. “If federation support continues then we can also play England and the USA at the World Cup in 10 years.” At the moment, Irandoost just wants to build on the progress from the Asian Cup. “That was very important. Before, many thought that it is OK for girls just to play football but after the Asian Cup people are saying that we could be in big tournaments and even win. Our goals have become much bigger in many ways.”",Sport/Football,‘Change the vision’: Iran Women push to break football barriers amid fan ban,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/change-the-vision-iran-women-push-to-break-football-barriers-despite-fan-ban
4/14/2022,"You will not remember this awful remake, for good reason. While the original was a classic piece of British cinema famed for its ambiguous (and literal) cliffhanger ending, this was a charmless hunk of dreck that ends with – no joke – Seth Green buying a set of speakers designed to be so loud that they can blow a woman’s clothes off. In a career in which Wahlberg has sometimes appeared to actively seek out bad movies, this will forever be his worst. Tim Burton’s Planet of the Apes is destined to go down in infamy. During its arduous development, Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger were both attached to play the lead. Eventually, though, it fell to Wahlberg, who accepted the role without reading a script. It shows. Worse still, he left Matt Damon’s role in Ocean’s 11 to make this nonsense. On the plus side, the decision to transform the incomprehensible Transformers series into a Wahlberg vehicle seems to have finally killed the franchise off for good. However, this film still had to be made to accomplish this, and people still paid to see it – an unfollowable mishmash of sludgy CGI and berserk Arthurian legend. The nicest thing you can say about this film is that Wahlberg’s character doesn’t seem to want to have sex with his own daughter in this one, as he did in the previous instalment. The big question about The Happening is whether or not Wahlberg knew it would turn out to be terrible. Did he read this script – about plants causing people to commit suicide with telepathy – and think, “Wow, this is great, I’m going to do my best acting here!” Or did he think, “This film stinks, better ham it all the way up”? If it’s the former, this is the worst film ever. If it’s the latter, it might be the best performance of his career. Nobody knows for sure, which is why it’s all the way down here. There are generally two types of Wahlberg film: the films in which he knows that he is funny, and the films in which he doesn’t understand that he is funny. Daddy’s Home (and its even worse sequel) is a rare oddity, in that Wahlberg spends the duration actively attempting to be funny and missing by acres. Not even having Will Ferrell as a foil can save him. Where did Jonathan Demme’s homage (a remake of Charade starring Anna Karina, Charles Aznavour and Agnès Varda) go wrong? Was it the moment when he decided to cast Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role? Well, yes, obviously. This is a terrible film and Wahlberg is terrible in it, yet as this list demonstrates it is also not his worst film by a mile. If you squint and think really hard, you can just about see what was trying to be accomplished here. Uncharted is a big-money action film that (action aside) lives and dies by the chemistry between Tom Holland and Wahlberg. Sadly for everyone, that chemistry is dead in the water. Ridley Scott’s cursed Getty movie will forever be known as the film in which mid-scandal Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer at lightning speed after the film was completed. Would a more traditional release have drawn more attention to Wahlberg’s anonymously capable turn as a security agent? No. I have seen this film twice and still forgot that he was in it. And he’s on the poster. A video game adaptation that also stars Ludacris and Nelly Furtado, Max Payne deserves to be remembered for one scene and one scene alone, in which Wahlberg eats a handful of performance-enhancing drugs and then sort of roars in slow motion until the sky catches fire. It’s an awful film only partially salvaged by this entertainingly witless slab of Nic Cage cosplay. That rarest of things, a semi-enjoyable Michael Bay project, Pain & Gain pitted Wahlberg against The Rock in a film designed to make neither of them look good. As a film, it has its moments. As a performance, this seems to be one of the few times when Wahlberg has decided to take the piss out of his persona at the same time as his director. Wahlberg doesn’t do a great deal in this Tina Fey/Steve Carell action comedy – he effectively just turns up for a few scenes with his top off – but it’s a good distillation of what the man is best at. He is passive and open and minimal, exuding a confidence that could quite easily be confused for dumbness. This is a role of almost zero depth, but Wahlberg knows and happily makes the most of it. Not counting the ill-judged Danny DeVito military comedy Renaissance Man, this was Wahlberg’s film debut. While he was always going to be blown to the peripheries by a young Leonardo DiCaprio, in both material and performance, he nevertheless helped to create a riveting role as The Path Leo Could Have Taken. There is a hint here of things to come. Less than the sum of its parts, James Gray’s We Own the Night was a relatively little-watched two-hander about warring siblings, played by Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix. It’s violent, but the violence doesn’t land right. It’s nominally sexy, but the sexiness is laboured. Luckily Phoenix and Wahlberg’s focused performances stop the film from straying into outright disaster. You have to feel a little sorry for Wahlberg here. The film was about his friend and set in his home town, and he spent years unsuccessfully asking all manner of directors to make it for him. He eventually convinced David O Russell, only for the film’s budget to be halved. And once the Sisyphean task of getting the thing made was completed, Wahlberg ended up being the least interesting thing about it. Next to the showboating of Christian Bale and Melissa Leo (both won Oscars) and Amy Adams, Wahlberg’s quiet, dedicated central performance was hard to spot at first. That is a shame because he is never less than compelling. Had Wahlberg been born 20 years earlier, he could have made a whole career out of films like The Other Guys. The movie walks the line between action and comedy uneasily – it’s aiming for Midnight Run and rarely hits the target – but Wahlberg nails the tone from the off. Macho and silly in equal measure, the entire film ends up hanging from his every move. Is it too late to get him to do this more often? The Guardian’s second best film of 2012 might not have aged impeccably in the last decade, but it does refine the art of Knowing What To Do With Mark Wahlberg to a precise science. As the adult friend of an inexplicably sentient teddy bear, Wahlberg is close to spectacular here, his big open face conveying a range of emotion that flits from joy to anguish to outright confusion. I Heart Huckabees is the sort of film that you only watch twice for one of two reasons: either you’re blown away by Wahlberg’s performance or you absolutely hate yourself. One of the most intensely annoying films ever created, slathering a half-written sixth-form philosophy essay in the kind of relentlessly smug self-awareness that stops you from sleeping at night, the only thing that comes remotely close to saving I Heart Huckabees is Wahlberg’s sweet idiot firefighter Tommy. There is glee in his eyes when he repeatedly smashes Jason Schwartzman in the face with a space hopper that is 20 times better than anything else that happens in this godforsaken film. Behind-the-scenes shenanigans might have overcome the power of Three Kings – George Clooney is more than willing to explain to anyone who will listen – which is a shame, because the film holds up incredibly well. Not only does it keep its (grown-up, satirical) point of view in an iron grip at all times, but it also lays a canvas for a wackadoo war caper. While he lacks the sophistication of Clooney or the innate authority of Ice Cube, Wahlberg holds the entire thing together. Unlikely as it sounds, he becomes the one thing you end up caring about in the whole giddy mess. Looking back, The Departed wasn’t quite the knockout that everyone claimed at the time. It’s too long, too on the nose, too happy to indulge some of Jack Nicholson’s worst excesses. But, dear God, does the film light up whenever Wahlberg shows up. He doesn’t show up terribly often – and, with the exception of his final appearance, nothing he does is of much consequence – but the texture he adds to the film as a whole is undeniable. His Sergeant Dignam is a ball of hilariously unjustified fury throughout, and his accent is as thick as tectonic plate. Incredible. After three years of bit parts and missteps, this is where Wahlberg landed fully formed on the A-list. Boogie Nights is one of those movies that has transcended cinema to become a cultural touchstone, and Wahlberg’s performance – simultaneously roiling and guileless – as porn star Dirk Diggler deserves just as much credit as Paul Thomas Anderson’s script or the setting, or the soundtrack. In retrospect, Boogie Nights was both a blessing and a curse for Wahlberg; it proved he could really act, but also set a high-water mark that he couldn’t hope to live up to.

4/14/2022,"Good morning. The flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet has been severely damaged, Moscow has said, following an explosion that Ukraine claimed was due to a missile strike. The entire crew was evacuated. “As a result of a fire, ammunition detonated on the Moskva missile cruiser. The ship was seriously damaged,” the Russian defence ministry said, adding that the cause of the fire was being determined. A Ukrainian official said it was hit by two anti-ship missiles but did not provide evidence. The setback for Moscow comes as its offensive in Ukraine’s south and east intensifies, with Russia claiming its forces have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol. This has not been independently confirmed. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for an oil embargo on Wednesday, demanding EU states “stop sponsoring Russia’s military machine”. The US president, Joe Biden, announced a further $800m in military assistance to Ukraine as the country prepares for Russia to ramp up its efforts in the country’s eastern regions. A Michigan police officer fatally shot a Black man in the back of the head while he was face-down on the ground, following a traffic stop, chase and struggle over a Taser gun, according to videos released by police. Patrick Lyoya, 26, was killed outside a house in Grand Rapids on 4 April. The city’s new police chief, Eric Winstrom, released four videos on Wednesday, including footage recorded by a passenger in Lyoya’s car. The footage shows Lyoya running from the white officer after being stopped over his vehicle’s license plate. They struggled in front of several homes, with a fight over the Taser lasting about 90 seconds, according to Winstrom. The officer repeatedly ordered Lyoya to “let go” of his Taser. In the final moments, the officer was on top of Lyoya, kneeling on his back at times. What will happen to the officer? He is on paid leave during the investigation. Where did the footage come from? Lyoya’s passenger, the officer’s body-worn camera, the patrol car and a doorbell camera. Donald Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows has been removed from North Carolina’s voter roll amid an inquiry into whether he committed voter fraud by registering at a residence he never owned or lived in. The New Yorker, which reported the story last month, said Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman, had registered at a rented mobile home in Scaly Mountain, which he reportedly had never visited. Meadows, who has claimed voter fraud played a role in Trump’s election defeat, then voted from there as an absentee in the 2020 presidential election. Why was he removed? Meadows reportedly voted in Virginia, where he owns a property, in 2021, triggering his removal from North Carolina’s rolls. The North Carolina state bureau of investigation is continuing its inquiry into possible voter fraud, according to the Citizen, and would not say if Meadows’ removal from the roll would affect its investigation.

The fruit symbolizes the threat posed by the world’s food diversity crisis: hundreds of different varieties have been cultivated over thousands of years. But we now eat just one variety, which is being threatened by a fungus, aided by conditions exacerbated by the climate crisis.

4/14/2022,"All fast food will eventually become vegan, a leading plant-based restaurateur has said, after Burger King trialled making one of its flagship restaurants completely meat-free. The Burger King outlet in Leicester Square, London, has been offering only vegan food for a month to test its popularity. This includes a plant-based version of its Whopper burger, as well as a “chicken” katsu burger and vegan nuggets. James Lewis, who works in marketing and product development for the vegan restaurant 123V on Bond Street, London, said this was part of a growing trend. Lewis, who with the French chef Alexis Gauthier runs two fully vegan restaurants in London, said: “What we were looking for was to appeal to everyone in a family, a group of friends, people who weren’t vegan to begin with. We call [the vegan burger] a gateway dish, something someone is easily familiar with.” He hoped that meat-eating friends of vegans would visit the restaurant, try its vegan burger and realise it was just as nice as a regular one – and perhaps make that swap more frequently in future. Because much of the meat in fast-food dishes is processed, in a sauce or under a layer of condiments and cheese, vegan options have been relatively easy to substitute. When Greggs launched a vegan sausage roll in 2019, many commented that the meaty, herby mush contained within the crisp pastry was almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The chain has since made a vegan version of its popular sausage, bean and cheese melt. “Fast food is 100% the best area to switch to vegan,” Lewis said, adding: “The chains are often sneered at by people but they are setting the trends here. There’s no point starting a vegan chain because once McDonald’s figure out how to make a good vegan burger, they will think: ‘What’s the point in the cost of keeping all these animals when we can make it just as good and grow it in the ground?’ “Not too long from now, people will be getting their burger and it’ll be a vegan one and that’ll be the norm and they won’t think any different.” Burger King has set a target of a 50% meat-free menu by 2030. However, the chain’s decision to turn its Leicester Square branch vegan has caused some controversy. Dominique Samuels, a commentator for the rightwing broadcaster GB News, accused the chain of being “manipulative”. She said: “It’s extremely manipulative.

So it’s basically trying to force people into consuming chemically enhanced fake meat.” Lewis said he did not agree with this assessment, adding: “I don’t think Burger King is trying to trick anyone … they’ve painted the whole thing green and put in 6ft-long letters ‘meat free’. “A lot of people are terrified of looking at themselves in the mirror and seeing the world being changed and having their morals questioned.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Burger King tests vegan branch amid prediction all fast food outlets will follow,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/14/meat-feasts-to-go-burger-king-tests-all-vegan-london-branch
4/14/2022,"The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has risen to the highest level since records began 15 years ago, with A&E and ambulance waits also soaring amid high Covid rates, staff shortages and increased demand. NHS data shows 6.2 million people are waiting to start treatment, the highest number since records began in August 2007. Of these, 23,281 have been waiting more than two years. NHS England said this was down from 23,778 at the end of January, but it is about nine times the 2,608 people who had been waiting this long in April 2021. Ministers have promised to eliminate all waits of more than two years by July. But doctors, NHS leaders and health experts say the target looks increasingly unachievable. On Wednesday the Guardian revealed that operations were being cancelled across England as Covid causes major disruption in the NHS. The NHS is under severe pressure caused by a combination of unprecedented demand for urgent and emergency care, tens of thousands of Covid-related staff absences, high numbers of people in hospital with Covid, and delays in discharging patients as Covid and workforce gaps hit social care services. Thursday’s figures show the extent of the crisis. The proportion of people waiting more than four hours at A&E departments rose to its highest ever level in March. Just over 28% of people waited at least four hours across all A&Es, while in type 1 A&Es – those at major hospitals – the rate was 41%. There were more than 2.1 million attendances at A&Es in March, up 28.5% on March 2021. A record 22,506 people waited more than 12 hours in A&E in March from a decision to admit to actually being admitted. That was up from 16,404 in February, and is the highest for any calendar month in records going back to August 2010. “Today’s data highlight the extreme pressure on NHS patients and staff, with millions of people feeling the negative effects of a health system struggling under unbearable strain,” said Hugh Alderwick, the director of policy at the Health Foundation. Danielle Jefferies, an analyst at the King’s Fund health thinktank, said that despite a recent focus from the government on tackling the backlog, the data showed “pressures now reaching unacceptable levels in all parts of the health and care system”. The average response time last month for ambulances in England dealing with the most urgent incidents – calls from people with life-threatening illnesses or injuries – was nine minutes and 35 seconds. This was up from eight minutes and 51 seconds in February and is the longest average since current records began in August 2017. Ambulances in England took an average of one hour, one minute and three seconds last month to respond to emergency calls, such as for burns, epilepsy and strokes. This was up from 42 minutes and seven seconds in February and is the longest time on record for this category of callouts. Dr Tim Cooksley, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said it was “deeply concerning” that the “inability to even come close to meeting performance targets has now come to be expected” every month. “There is not a chance of a recovery of elective care until the systemic problems beleaguering urgent and emergency care are sorted effectively and long term,” he said. Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS England national medical director, said: “Nobody should be under any illusion about how tough a job NHS staff have on their hands, balancing competing priorities and maintaining high-quality patient care.” Despite pressure on multiple fronts, the longest waits for patients were falling, he added, and staff were working hard to adopt innovative approaches to help patients get treated faster.",News/Society,Number of people on NHS waiting lists in England at record high,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/number-of-people-on-nhs-waiting-lists-in-england-at-record-high
4/14/2022,"Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the heartbreaking stories of families torn apart and desperate women and children fleeing violence and atrocities have reminded us all of the brutal reality faced by refugees escaping conflict and oppression all over the world. The British public have shown remarkable compassion and understanding in wanting to offer a warm welcome to all Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in the UK. But instead of harnessing this compassion for refugees and making Britain a nation of sanctuary – as the Scottish government has pledged to do – Boris Johnson’s administration in England has chosen to effectively offshore people seeking asylum to Rwanda; to treat them as no more than human cargo to be shipped thousands of miles away so they are out of sight and out of mind. They would no longer be given a fair hearing on UK soil – and would be penalised for having, through no fault of their own, taken the wrong route to safety. It takes the government’s desire to punish and expel our fellow human beings to another level. Under its cruel nationality and borders bill, which will next week return to the Commons after being defeated for a second time by the Lords, those coming across the Channel would be criminalised and could face imprisonment for up to four years. Rwanda already hosts around 140,000 refugees in six refugee camps. The country’s president, Paul Kagame, regularly speaks about his commitment to refugee protection, having himself been a refugee in Uganda. However, the country has a poor human rights record, is a source country for many refugees who fear political persecution and torture by the Kagame regime, and has been accused of engaging in assassination attempts against Rwandan exiles abroad. If you were a Ukrainian refugee or an Afghan fleeing the Taliban, you certainly wouldn’t want to be sent to Rwanda. Israel sent Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers to Rwanda under a policy that was eventually abandoned following international and domestic criticism and protests. A study by German academics found they weren’t given the opportunity to apply for asylum – and were forced to embark on dangerous journeys at the hands of people smugglers to get to safety elsewhere. When Australia sought to send people seeking asylum to neighbouring pacific island nations Papua New Guinea and Nauru, the policy was a failure. A review of the sorry episode by the University of NSW in Sydney concluded it didn’t deter people taking dangerous journeys or do anything to break the business model of people smugglers. Instead it incurred huge financial cost for taxpayers, triggered multiple legal challenges and led to “systemic cruelty” with people taking their own lives and self-harming. Over the past decade, Australian government data suggests that just more than 3,000 asylum seekers have been outsourced, at a total cost of over £1bn, and most were ultimately recognised as refugees. And let’s not forget that the people the government is seeking to offshore are not all illegal economic migrants, as it claims, but are mainly those who have escaped bloodshed and terror. They are exercising their right under the UN refugee convention, which the UK was a founding signatory of, to seek asylum in a country of their choosing. Government data shows that those coming across the Channel are mainly from 10 countries, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Eritrea and Afghanistan, where persecution and oppression are not uncommon. Overall, around two-thirds are actually granted refugee status or protection in the UK. There is little to suggest the government’s plans to send people seeking asylum to Rwanda will be a success for them individually, or for the government in terms of deterring people from making dangerous journeys at the hands of people smugglers. There are, of course, better ways to create a fair, humane and orderly asylum system. It is possible to demonstrate control while protecting the most vulnerable. Doing so has two main elements. First, protection in host countries around the world must be strengthened. In a globalised world, if the UK is serious about reducing the need for refugees to take dangerous journeys, it should invest in humanitarian and development aid for them in countries where people flee from. In east Africa, it should support countries such as Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda to better protect the refugees that they already host. Instead of spending millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on transferring refugees thousands of miles away, we could allocate that money to assist hundreds of thousands of refugees before they risk their lives by travelling to the UK. Based on Australia’s failed experience, offshoring one asylum seeker for one year is likely to cost the same as supporting thousands of refugees already in situ for a year. Second, and most importantly, the government should adopt effective policies that will actually address the Channel crossings. It should invest in fair and effective asylum processing when people arrive, on both the beaches in France and in the UK. At the end of last year, more than 100,000 people were waiting for an outcome on their initial claim for asylum – and of them 62,000 had been waiting for more than six months. The fact that initially no more than a few hundred will actually be sent to Rwanda suggests the government is hedging its bets in the knowledge that it may not deliver what it hopes, and be quietly shelved as happened in Australia. We should also offer humanitarian visas from assessment centres set up at British embassies elsewhere in Europe, including France and other key “hotspots”, to enable people in need to travel without resorting to smuggling networks. And critically, we should work multilaterally – not with remote countries such as Rwanda, but through an effective bilateral agreement with France and our EU neighbours. There are many ways to achieve effective borders while protecting vulnerable refugees. They need not rely on criminalising men, women and children who reach our shores, or on paying large sums of taxpayers’ money to other countries to run schemes that are proven to be cruel and ineffective.

4/14/2022,"Environmental campaigners have caused rush-hour chaos in west London by clambering on to an oil tanker and forcing the closure of a major roundabout leading to the start of the M4 motorway. “Road closures are currently in place at the Chiswick roundabout,” Hounslow police tweeted on Thursday morning. “Diversions are in place. Please avoid the area if possible.” Four activists were glued to the top of an Eddie Stobart fuel tanker at the junction, which feeds traffic from west London on and off the M4. Off the side of the articulated lorry they had draped flags reading: “Just Stop Oil.” Initially cars were able to pass the occupied tanker on lanes either side, with many drivers hurling abuse at the protesters. But as more police arrived they closed the roundabout. Activists from @JustStop_Oil have stopped an oil tanker at the Chiswick roundabout at the start of the M4 in west London pic.twitter.com/RlWTkayJMp The activists, who have been blockading fuel terminals since 1 April, causing petrol and diesel shortages in some areas, said they aimed to bring their protests to the public. “This is about making the invisible visible,” one shouted to the Guardian from atop the tanker. “It’s about showing people the stuff that is destroying people’s livelihoods and ecosystems.” In a statement, Just Stop Oil accepted responsibility for stopping the tanker and said its activists were working “to stop the flow of oil in London”. The group has vowed to disrupt oil deliveries in London until the government agrees a moratorium on all new oil and gas projects. The protest comes as reports of petrol and diesel shortages continued in areas targeted by Just Stop Oil. Over the past fortnight, the group has staged blockades and mass trespasses at 11 oil distribution facilities. On Wednesday, it was reported that one major petrochemical company, the US-headquartered Valero oil, had obtained an injunction banning protests at its UK sites. Valero owns the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire that has been repeatedly targeted by Just Stop Oil. The Labour party previously called for the government to impose “national injunctions” banning the group’s protests, leading to criticism after it was pointed out that that was not how injunctions work. In response, Just Stop Oil said Labour was “betraying its past, betraying the youth of this country, of every country and are complicit in climate genocide”.

When the Eddie Stobart tanker arrived, one ran to the nearest traffic lights and pushed the button. They then stood in front of the cab, unfurled their banner and told the driver that others were climbing aboard his trailer.

4/14/2022,"The actor Thandiwe Newton has denied reports that she was fired from the new Magic Mike film after an argument over Will Smith with co-star Channing Tatum. Newton has said that she left the film after 11 days of shooting in London of her own volition. “Thandiwe Newton has made the difficult decision to step away from the production of Warner Bros Pictures’ Magic Mike’s Last Dance to deal with family matters,” a spokesperson said in a statement. Representatives for the actor called reports that she had been fired by Tatum, who is also a producer on the film, “completely inaccurate”. The report, which first surfaced in the Sun, suggested that Tatum and Newton had fallen out when discussing the incident at the Oscars last month in which Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage, following a joke that had been made about his wife’s alopecia. A source called the disagreement a “confrontation” and added that Tatum had said: “I am not working with her any more.” Salma Hayek will take over Newton’s role. Magic Mike’s Last Dance sees a return for Tatum to the role of male stripper Mike Lane, as well as a return to the franchise for the original’s director, Steven Soderbergh, who exited for the second film. The two films have made over $300m at the global box office. A lucrative stage spin-off, Magic Mike Live, has had shows in Las Vegas, London, Berlin and Australia. Speaking to People magazine, Tatum expressed the hope the new film would be like “the Super Bowl of stripping”, with a much higher quality of routines than previously seen. He also described the films as “very, very female-forward” and stressed the importance for him of a strong female lead. “I want to have an equal, if not even more centralised female character for Mike to really play off of and almost to … I don’t want to say, [to have her] take the baton, but really let the movie be about a female’s experience and not Mike’s experience, because it has been so much about Mike and the guys’ experiences.” Newton is currently starring opposite Chris Pine in Amazon hit All the Old Knives.",Arts/Film,Thandiwe Newton denies being fired from Magic Mike due to row with Channing Tatum over Will Smith,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/14/thandiwe-newton-denies-being-fired-from-magic-mike-due-to-bust-up-with-channing-tatum
4/14/2022,"On a cold winter night, three armed men disguised as police officers arrived at a suburban home in a small Canadian resort town and knocked on the door, claiming that they had an arrest warrant for a 37-year-old woman who was staying there. After overpowering the homeowner, they seized the woman, Iranian-born Elnaz Hajtamiri, hauled her barefoot through the snow into a vehicle, and sped off into the dark. Nearly three months later, police admit they are no closer to locating Hajtamiri, in a case that has baffled investigators. “I have never, never come across a case like this,” Ontario provincial police detective inspector Martin Graham told reporters this week, adding that investigators had not determined a motive or received any ransom demands. They also have not located the white Lexus SUV vehicle used in the abduction on 12 January, nor have they identified its owner. “My biggest hope is that Elnaz is alive,” said Graham. “My greatest fear is that she is not.” Police took the “extraordinary” step of reaching out to the Iranian community in Toronto and Montreal as they expand the scope of their search, and are contemplating the possibility that she has been taken out of the country. This week, investigators also said they believed a brutal assault on Hajtamiri in December was linked to her abduction. Two weeks before the kidnapping, Hajtamiri was attacked in the parking garage of her condo in Richmond Hill, a city north of Toronto. The assailants beat her with a frying pan and left her with serious head wounds that required 40 stitches. Police say they later retrieved a tracking device. Two other tracking devices were found in her car when she brought the vehicle in for servicing in November. After the December attack, Hajtamiri feared for her safety and moved in with family in the town of Wasaga Beach, 145km (90 miles) north of Toronto. The only time she reportedly left the beachfront community was 10 January, to retrieve her vehicle, computer and mobile phone from police. Two days later, she was abducted. No arrests have been made in the parking garage assault, but police say they do not believe the same men were involved. “We have at least five different people responsible directly for these crimes,” said Graham. “Despite the number of people involved, we have received no information that would provide us with a definite link as to where the investigation should be headed.” In late January, police arrested her former boyfriend Mohamad Lilo, charging him with criminal harassment. The two broke up in October, but he tried to contact her the next month and police become involved. Officers would not say if he is a suspect in her abduction, but said they are investigating the relationship, which they said was both personal and professional. Hajtamiri, who also goes by the surname Tamiri, emigrated to Canada less than four years ago, after she lost her husband. She had recently started her own cake-making company after leaving an import-export business. In their latest push for new information, police released a video of Fariba Hajtamiri, Elnaz’s mother, pleading for her daughter’s release. Fariba, who still lives in Iran, said the family’s life has become “desperate” as they hope for Elnaz’s release. “We desperately need your help,” she said in Farsi. “I beg you as a mother to guide us and tell us anything you know. Please, I beg of you.”",News/Weather,Case of Iranian-born woman abducted by fake officers baffles Canadian police,https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2022/apr/14/iranian-born-woman-fake-officers-elnaz-hajtamiri-canadian-police
4/14/2022,"The UK’s largest sandbank has been protected from bottom trawling, an environmentally destructive fishing technique. Activists have been calling on the government for years to stop bottom trawling at Dogger Bank, an important site off the east coast of England for species including sand eels, hermit crabs, flatfish and starfish. Recent data showed the fishing method, involving weighted nets being dragged across the seabed, had tripled in occurrence in the marine protected area (MPA) since Brexit. This is despite the area being labelled an MPA. Bottom trawling happens in many of these environmentally significant areas, leading campaigners and experts to refer to them as nothing but “paper parks”. Not only does it disturb species living on the seabed, it is also a significant source of carbon release, as the seabed normally acts as a valuable sink to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, but turns into a carbon source when disturbed. Now, the method will be banned, with government sources referring to the new legislation as a result of “Brexit freedoms”. The four bylaws, being introduced using new powers under the 2020 Fisheries Act, will come into effect in June. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “Outside the EU, we are using our new freedoms to protect our marine environment. We will be stopping trawling and dredging in these marine protected areas to protect wildlife and habitats, through powers we have in our Fisheries Act 2020.” As well as Dogger Bank, there are three other MPAs being saved from bottom trawling. These are Inner Dowsing, Race Bank and North Ridge special area of conservation, , which lies off the south Lincolnshire coast, the South Dorset marine conservation zone and the Canyons marine conservation zone, which is in the far south-west corner of the UK’s continental shelf area. However, experts have pointed out there are 64 MPAs, most of which have few protections from destructive fishing. Melissa Moore, the head of UK policy at the NGO Oceana, said: “It’s good news that government has at last taken the first step to manage four of its 64 offshore benthic MPAs, given that damaging activity such as bottom trawling is prohibited in MPAs under conservation law. “We fully support the Dogger Bank bylaw that will protect the whole site and have benefits for the North Sea ecosystem beyond. However, the bylaw proposed for Inner Dowsing MPA is tiny and will only protect parts of the site. We call on UK to remedy this and with devolved governments to act quickly to ban bottom-towed gear in the remaining 60 offshore MPAs that they promised to manage following Oceana’s legal challenge in 2021. This is now increasingly urgent due to the climate and ecological crises.” Greenpeace has been campaigning for the government to stop trawling at Dogger Bank, most notably dropping rocks in the MPA to thwart trawlers. Campaigners have asked the government to use its post-Brexit powers to go further and ban destructive fishing practices in all MPAs. Fiona Nicholls, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s been 18 months since Greenpeace built a protective boulder barrier in the Dogger Bank and since the government committed to stop bottom trawling in this iconic and ecologically important area. While this is a major step towards protecting some of the most environmentally significant features of the Dogger Bank, destructive industrial fishing vessels like factory trawlers will still be allowed to plunder this now partially protected area. “We need the government to get us on track this year to fully or highly protecting all of our marine protected areas. That means, as a starting point, banning all destructive industrial fishing vessels. This could be done using post-Brexit powers to restrict fishing licences, rather than simply relying on the cumbersome process of introducing partial site bylaw restrictions. Only then will the UK be a true world leader in marine protection, and can nature and coastal communities have a chance to recover.”",News/Environment,UK’s largest sandbank given protection from bottom trawling,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/14/uk-largest-sandbank-dogger-bank-protection-bottom-trawling
4/14/2022,"In a gray sharkskin suit and aviator sunglasses, Pastor Christopher Benek stands on a patch of astroturf at the edge of the First Miami Presbyterian church parking lot. “Here’s the thing,” he says. “Right now this is a parking lot.” A developer has a plan to make it much more than that, and Benek is buying in. Benek was hired in 2018 as a “crisis-management specialist” to lead First Miami Presbyterian, the oldest congregation in the city, away from what seemed like impending ruin. The church has been a fixture in the community since 1896, peaking in membership at about 1,400 in the late 1980s before dwindling to 140 in the early aughts and continuing to decline. “They’ve been a financial wreck for years,” Benek says. “Those problems don’t get solved overnight.” With the church facing over $7m in back taxes, Benek has negotiated a potential deal to sell 2.2 acres of its 3.4 acre lot to a local developer for $240m. (Just four years ago, it was valued at $66m – a symptom of the rental market’s blistering recent inflation.) This last slice of undeveloped waterfront property in downtown Miami’s financial district has been coveted by developers for years. For the last two decades, religious affiliation in the US has continued to decline. Membership of denominations of Christianity – the country’s dominant religion – fell from 78% in 2007 to 63% in 2021, while the number of Americans with no religious affiliation – dubbed “nones” – has risen from 16% to 29% over the same timeframe. With large physical footprints, but precious few congregants, many traditional churches have faced difficult decisions about their viability, opting to downsize or close their doors altogether. But in Florida – particularly Miami, which has a severe housing shortage and was recently named the most expensive city for home ownership in America – developers are capitalizing by constructing multi-unit apartment buildings any place possible, giving church leadership there another option: selling to the highest bidder. As part of First Miami’s deal, the church would keep its sanctuary, but lose its school, office space and sun-scarred parking lot. It would get, Benek points out, 20,000 square feet of additional worship space just beneath a lavish pool deck on the 11th floor of the bay-front 80-story luxury condo tower the developer plans to build. After a recent Sunday service, a longtime church member, Cary Tolley, stood eyeing the building – its cherry-wood interior and handsomely oxidized tin roof mark a lull in the cold procession of modernist skyscrapers lining Biscayne Boulevard. “If this real estate transaction goes through, it won’t be long before the church closes its doors,” he says. As the voice of the opposition, Tolley has stuck his neck out to condemn the deal. Benek is undeterred. “There’s been no critique about the actual build, which tells me that all the opposition is only about politics and control,” he says. Walking towards the Biscayne Bay on the far side of the parking lot, Benek grows animated as he approaches a row of food trucks, where a few dozen young people sit on picnic tables beneath monitors playing promos for bible study. This was part of Benek’s initiative to put a modern gloss on some of the church’s assets. “Every day of the week, tons of people come here,” he says. “It’s pretty amazing.” The hope that it will attract some new faces to Bible study and that trucks will pay to rent a spot are increasingly common money-making tactics for churches in the state. But, in First Miami’s case, it’s not nearly enough to cover seven-figure debts. The more Benek talks, the easier it is to understand why some of the older members of the congregation find him off-putting. He overuses the verbs “leveraging” and “scaling” and name-checks Elon Musk as he compares technology to theology; during the pandemic, Benek launched a VR church service set in a virtual model of First Miami. Older congregants found it disagreeable and a waste of money. One of the main criticisms about the proposed deal – to which the Presbytery of Tropical Florida, a council that oversees the business dealings of all Presbyterian churches in the region, agreed – is that Benek held the deliberations and final voting over video chat, which the same demographic had a challenging time with. “Is the spirit of God not so big that it can’t work through Zoom?” Benek asks. He is unapologetic about his predictions for the future of the American church. In short, he says it could be extinct by the year 2030. “Churches can’t survive on passing the plate alone,” he says, referring to collecting tithes. “This isn’t the 1960s.” More and more churches are employing entrepreneurial business models to remain profitable in Florida’s rapidly growing metropolitan areas. In downtown Miami alone, four historic churches have sold in the last three years with condo high-rises going up in their place. Others are selling their air rights or are renting out unused interior space and parking lots. In February, a Lutheran church in a suburb of Miami agreed to share its property with a Wawa gas station and move into a smaller building behind the site’s convenience store. “Most of these churches are just trying to figure out a way to survive,” says Matt Messier, a Florida-based real estate broker who specializes in religious and non-profit properties. “When the property values go up, it gives them a lot more options.” Other than the federal government, religious organizations are the largest owners of real estate in the country, but in the near future we will undoubtedly see fewer spires and steeples. Messier says churches will embrace a more secular appearance, moving into existing community centers and fellowshipping in gyms, coffee shops – or, in the case of First Miami Presbyterian, the 11th floor of a luxury condominium. Pastor Audrey Warren provides a window into the future of First Miami Presbyterian church. In 2018, three years into her tenure as pastor of the nearby First United Methodist, she helped arrange the sale of her church’s original 1.15-acre property, just one mile north of First Miami, for $55m. Before the sale, 50% of its income came from renting out parking spaces to a community college. When its 40-year building inspection came up in 2016, the church estimated that the necessary renovations would have cost more than $500,000, which it couldn’t afford. “We were counting toilet paper rolls,” she said. Warren and church leadership vetted a parade of brokers and developers before finding the right fit. The new development project was christened Society Biscayne, a 49-story mixed-use apartment building, and the original church was promptly demolished. Once the build is complete, the 125-year-old congregation of First United Methodist will find its new home somewhere between the sky pool deck, co-working lab, yoga lawn and two-story gym. “We would never have survived on tithing alone,” she says. “There’s been a very steady decline since the 1970s.” And it will soon get worse. The “death tsunami of the church”, as Warren calls it, is expected to reach its apex within the next 10 to 20 years, as the death rate of Baby Boomers increases, according to US Census Bureau data. “These are the people who give a full tithe, but also our volunteers, teachers and elders,” she says. “We’re going to lose these people soon.” On the third Sunday of March, in the year of our Lord 2022, the airy corridors of First Miami Presbyterian church are filled with music but not people. This is only the second in-person service since the church has reopened after two years of virtual service due to the pandemic. Behind the altar, the lead singer of a praise band pounds away on his piano keys and looks out into the sparse crowd. The pews are about 15% full. “C’mon!” he says, inviting them to sing along. “Let’s knock the dust off these pews!” Preaching a reformist and relatively progressive strain of Christianity, First Miami’s Presbyterianism is one of the seven mainline denominations in America. The US constitution was inspired by Presbyterian governance, better known as “ecclesiastical polity”. As a cultural touchpoint for centuries, it’s the kind of church that would be with you for your baptism, wedding and funeral. The smattering of young families and seniors in the pews straddle these life events, but most people in this part of town – dotted with celebrity-chef steakhouses and multi-story nightclubs – are still partying from the previous night instead of attending to their souls. As Benek steps up to the stage to deliver his sermon, Cary Tolley sits near the back of the church, lean with a shiny bald head and white beard. His central complaint about the deal Benek is overseeing is that there’s no formal agreement about how the money will be used. “We’re completely reliant on the good faith of the presbytery that they’ll let the church use the money,” he says. Though the congregation voted in favor of selling last October, Tolley says that the vote should be thrown out on a technicality. Presbyterian churches have a representative form of government, “but the members have been largely shut out of this process … this is totally contrary to how a healthy church operates”. Following the vote, Tolley filed a remedial complaint with a higher court (the Presbyterian church has an especially complicated judicial system) and succeeded in delaying the sale. As he explains the forthcoming legal proceedings in great detail, a fellow churchgoer approaches Tolley and leans in to whisper in his ear. “Did you hear that?” he asks. “That person just told me, ‘You’re doing a good thing; keep it up.’” Not all houses of worship in Miami are struggling. Vous Church (short for rendezvous), run by a fourth-generation evangelical pastor to the stars, Rich Wilkerson Jr, attracts thousands of people to multiple campuses throughout south Florida every Sunday. “I don’t see us in competition with a place like Vous,” Benek says of the church whose pastor officiated Kanye West and Kim Kardashian’s wedding. “It’s easy to draw a crowd when you have Kanye West perform Sunday Service, but there’s victory and peril in that.” Benek suggests that eventually the magnetism of contemporary megachurches with charismatic pastors fades. “It’s all young people [at Vous]. What we want is intergenerational.” The mission of churches writ large, as Benek sees it, is to reduce suffering in the world, but that’s impossible if they can’t figure out a way to keep the lights on. If this sale goes through, the windfall of cash would get kicked back to the Presbytery of Tropical Florida, but he says the larger portion will be used to fund homelessness programs, staffing, Bible studies and, of course, the VR offering. All of which, he says, will help grow their membership. No matter how many churches close, or how few congregants remain after the current trend bottoms out, Benek is confident that the core tenets of Christianity will never fall apart. “Look at where we are,” he says, glancing up at the glass towers neighboring his church, which radiate the kind of disquieting emptiness characteristic of trendy new development projects. “The people who live in Brickell have more money than most Americans could ever dream of, but money will never answer their existential questions,” he says. Lolling back to eye level, he affects a solemn expression. “After all, the enemy of humanity is death.

4/14/2022,"More than two years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, nearly a quarter of incarcerated people awaiting their day in court in San Francisco county are being held beyond their original trial deadlines, with some individuals waiting for years for their cases to be heard. In June 2020, in the early months of the pandemic, 68 people were incarcerated in the county past their original trial deadlines, according to data from the public defender. By January 2022, the latest data available, that number had grown to nearly 250. Hundreds more are awaiting trial out of custody. California state law stipulates that those accused of crimes are entitled to a speedy trial – 30 to 60 days following their arraignment, depending on the nature of the crime. But backlogs in the court system, made worse by the pandemic, have obliterated those deadlines, often at significant cost to the mental health and wellbeing of those imprisoned, and their loved ones. The problem in the county became so severe that Mano Raju, the San Francisco public defender, filed a lawsuit in September 2021 alleging the city’s superior court is violating people’s constitutional right to a speedy trial. “These aren’t even people who have been convicted of a crime,” Raju said. “They’re just awaiting their day in court.” This disproportionately affects communities of color. Though Black residents comprise 6% of San Francisco’s total population, they make up about 45% of the county jail population. “Our clients are largely poor and from communities of color, so when their rights are trampled there isn’t always the outcry there would be if this was happening to people from another community,” said Raju. Robert Brewer said the long wait showed the criminal justice system’s unfairness. It has taken a toll on his health and put his life on hold. “You’re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, but you’re treated as if you’ve already been sentenced,” he said. Brewer was found not guilty of a homicide charge in May 2021 following a trial, after being held for more than five months past his original trial date. But since his release, the experience of incarceration has continued to affect his mental health. “Being released is not as joyful as you might expect,” Brewer said. “You come out of this hole with very little human contact. You make it out, but you leave a big piece of yourself in jail.” In his lawsuit, Raju points to the lingering effects of case backlogs on individuals’ mental health and the county jail’s treatment of incarcerated people during Covid-19 lockdowns to argue the court should do more to address the backlogs. Some people who have been incarcerated told the Guardian they were allowed out of their cells for less than an hour a day during outbreaks of the virus. Brewer said he was only allowed to shower every two to three days before returning to his cell, after a cellmate contracted Covid. Solitary confinement and social isolation have been strongly linked to negative impacts on mental health, including a heightened risk of suicide. The San Francisco sheriff’s department, which manages the jail, said it followed practices recommended by health officials in keeping custody officers and jail residents safe. The department acknowledged incarcerated people were sometimes held in their cells for upwards of 23 hours a day, citing a variety of reasons such as “social distancing protocols, quarantine protocols, isolation protocols, disciplinary action, administrative segregation, and staffing shortages”. Raju said: “Solitary-like conditions mean you can’t leave a cell, often one where you can reach out your arms and touch the walls, for more than one hour per day. This can have a strong psychological impact.” Kwixuan Maloof, a San Francisco deputy public defender, says that a trial deadline can serve as a source of stability and encourages people to resist the temptation to accept a plea bargain, which often involves pleading guilty and avoiding a trial in exchange for the possibility of more lenient sentencing or a charge being downgraded. But without that guarantee, the pressure to accept a bargain goes up, even for those who believe they have a strong chance of being exonerated in court. “It’s very frustrating for me, and ten times more so for my clients, when they ask me when their trial is going to start and all I can say is ‘I don’t know,’” said Maloof. “In those circumstances, it becomes very easy to say: ‘You know what, I’m done. I’m going to take whatever deal they offer me.’” Prior to the pandemic, court backlogs were far from unheard of in the US. But an August 2021 study by the Thomson Reuters Institute found that the pandemic had substantially increased such backlogs nationwide, as trials were indefinitely delayed during surges of the virus and courts struggled to adapt to virtual operations. According to the judicial council of California, the clearance rate for criminal trials statewide has dropped by around 20% during the pandemic. As restrictions start to ease, success at alleviating the backlogs has been mixed as different municipalities experiment with varying approaches. Matt Malone, a public information officer with the Contra Costa county superior court, said that through a number of initiatives, the court had brought its case backlog from 104 in March 2021 to 51 in March 2022. If not for the suspension of jury trials during the Omicron surge, Malone notes, the backlog would probably have been even lower. Malone added the county had taken steps to adapt to social distancing requirements, such as making sure remote capabilities were “tremendously expanded”, staggering jury calls, and installing air filtration systems in courtrooms. Rose Marie Sims, a plaintiff in the legal action filed by Raju against the San Francisco superior court, said her son Christopher had been incarcerated for over two years and still had not received a trial. “I can’t believe this is America. I love this country, but the judicial system seems to have lost its mind,” said Sims. “How do you keep someone locked up like that without giving them their trial? Every time I talk with my son on the phone, I can hear the light leaving him.” Sims said her son had lost his fiancee and job and would need to start over. “He’s lost everything,” she said. “It’s traumatizing as a parent.” The public defender’s office, as well as the San Francisco district attorney, have called on the San Francisco superior court to make more rooms available for criminal trials in the civic center courthouse. In February of this year, Raju filed a petition in the California courts of appeal asking that the San Francisco court be forced to take steps to prioritize criminal trials. The Contra Costa county superior court, where Raju filed his original lawsuit in September, had concluded it did not have authority over the San Francisco superior court. A spokesperson for San Francisco superior court said the court was committed to justice and “processing all cases as expeditiously as possible under the difficult circumstances presented by the pandemic.” But Raju disagrees and said more needed to be done to process cases swiftly. “How long it will take to address the backlog depends on what the court is willing to do,” he said. “There is a lack of urgency.”  In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

4/14/2022,"I grew up quite close to 12th-century Pennard Castle on the Gower peninsula and it enthralled me as a child; it’s a ruin but still obviously a castle and in my imagination it was full of knights on horses jousting and lots of arrow slits so you can ambush your mates. The castle’s situation is dramatic and beautiful: it is perched on the edge of the valley, with a sheer drop below to the north and west. From it there is a sweeping view out towards Three Cliffs Bay, among the most beautiful beaches in the UK. From Parkmill village you walk about a mile down Pennard Pill river through the woods before the castle reveals itself. It’s free to visit.Piers On a rocky outcrop overlooking a golden beach in Northumberland, Bamburgh Castle still takes my breath away. Not only is the castle oozing with fascinating and rich history, it’s on of the most beautiful and underrated coastlines in the UK. I grew up in Newcastle so Bamburgh Castle was always somewhere we would enjoy as a family no matter the time of year. Costing £14.10 for adults and £6.95 for children, the castle also offers outdoor theatre and cinema experiences, craft and art days, historic re-enactments and much more.Abbey Ramsey  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

But as you drive around a bend on the A496, the view of Edward I’s Harlech Castle atop a rocky outcrop is particularly magnificent. It’s not a huge castle but there’s still plenty to see. It’s very well maintained and the views from the top are exceptional. There’s a small pay-and-display a short walk from the entrance, but don’t get caught out by turning down the “world’s steepest street” next to it (Ffordd Pen Llech at 37.45% took the title from a road in Dunedin, New Zealand in 2019).

We roamed the ruins and explored the passageways for a few hours and got a real feel of what the castle would have been like when it was inhabited. The views of the historic city from the top were stunning. After our visit, we enjoyed a picnic on the lawn and then explored the neighbouring cathedral.

Its spacious grounds and quiet, unspoilt location in a pretty village make it a rare gem. However, its history is not all sweetness and light, as the tower was used as a prison. One of its most famous inmates was Richard Strode, MP for Plymouth, a tinner jailed in 1510 after complaining that mining debris in the moorland rivers was silting up the harbour at Plymouth. He described the castle as “one of the most annoious, contagious and detestable places wythin this realme”. Visiting it is free, as is the parking.Claire Late 11th-century Skipton Castle, survivor of a three-year siege during the English Civil War (it was occupied by royalists) is a superb place to visit.

4/14/2022,"“What is it about ambiguity,” asked Tim Parks in 2015, “that it has to be praised to high heaven by all and sundry? Above all, how did it come to take on, at least for some, a cloak of liberal righteousness?” Reading Julian Barnes’s new novel, the question feels especially apposite. This is a work that both uses and abuses ambiguity. In doing so, it undermines itself. Elizabeth Finch, the novel’s eponymous subject, teaches an adult education course in culture and civilisation. The narration comprises the recollections of Neil, her former student and would-be hagiographer. Her class, he tells us, “shook my mind around, made me constantly rethink, burst stars inside my head”. Students were awestruck by “the shimmer of her phrasing, the lustre of her brain”. Under her tutelage they “actually began, in real time, to think for ourselves”. There’s a sense of daring in depicting the impact of an inspirational teacher. If Finch and her teaching fall short, our faith in the novel will falter. Early on, we sense Barnes’s hesitancy. Straining to burnish Finch’s aura, he deploys, then redeploys, a reliable novelistic cliche – charisma through immobility. In the first paragraph, Finch is “still”. By page six she’s “preternaturally still”. “She commanded attention,” says Neil, spelling it out, “by her stillness.” So Finch doesn’t move much. But that’s just the start of what she doesn’t do. Finch, we’re told, “didn’t smoke like anyone else”. “She had none of those lecturer’s tics and tricks designed to charm, distract, or indicate character. She never waved her arms about or supported her chin in her hand.” She was “not in any way a public figure”. She “wasn’t interested in football or celebrity chefs or the ever-changing dictates of fashion, or box sets or gossip”, but “she wasn’t in any way a snob” either. Sounds a bit mysterious, doesn’t she? But no: she “had no ‘mysteriousness’ about her” either. This is ambiguity not as subtlety, but avoidance: Finch simply isn’t there. Hoping to make a virtue of her absence, Barnes lays down a fog of negation. But this only deepens the problem. The reader feels distanced from Finch; the novel feels distanced from its subject. Finch’s impact, then, must come from the work to which the novel forms a tribute: her teaching. According to Neil, she “directed us elegantly away from the obvious”. A quick scan of her aphoristic wisdom, however, suggests that she did so exclusively by stating the obvious. Acting is “the perfect example of artificiality producing authenticity”. “Failure can tell us more than success.” “Insults most often occur when an argument is being lost.” Voting is a “civic duty”. Anarchism has a certain intellectual appeal but “realistically, it would never work”. And love, would you believe, is “all there is … the only thing that matters”. “If she taught us one thing,” says Neil, further diluting the thin gruel of Finch’s thought, “it was that history is for the long haul.” Finch’s studiously bien-pensant truisms, coupled with Barnes’s via negativa characterisation, leave the novel in search of a centre. Barnes, it seems, senses this: 44 pages in, he cuts his losses and kills Finch off – a move which, tellingly, brings the novel to life. Bequeathed Finch’s journals, Neil becomes a historian of his history teacher. The fragmentary, elusive portrait of Finch that emerges feels far more intimate and interesting than the one glimpsed through Neil’s coursing admiration. Freed from the narrative responsibility of investing Finch with energy, meanwhile, Neil softens, expands, and becomes a fuller figure in his own right. Barnes is in his element here – investigating with subtlety and gentleness the quiet mysteries that make up a life. So it’s all the more mystifying and disappointing that, just as the novel Elizabeth Finch could have been moves tantalisingly into view, Barnes self-sabotages, devoting the book’s entire middle section to Neil’s stolid student essay on Julian the Apostate, the “Roman emperor who never set foot in Rome”, known for his “persecution by methods of mildness”. As Neil labours away at one of the novel’s many undercooked and unintegrated ideas – the shortcomings of monotheism – the narrative flounders, never to recover. In Barnes’s tripartite structure, each new section must compensate for the shortcomings of the last. With a motionless middle on his hands, Barnes works in the final third to recover some sense of momentum. In his search for compelling incident, though, he finds only implausibility. Returning to Neil’s recollections, we learn of Finch’s public “shaming”. Invited by the London Review of Books to give a small public lecture, Finch (who, let us recall, was “not in any way a public figure”) finds that her historical perspective on monotheism has, ludicrously, become the subject of a furious national outcry. It’s here that we’re reminded of Parks’ “cloak of liberal righteousness”. Barnes has depended too heavily on ambiguity as a substitute for clarity. Consequently, Finch and her ideas lack force. In order to bring about her cancellation, therefore, Barnes must distort the world in which those ideas are received. The result is neither a critique of a reactionary culture nor a defence of nuance and free thought. Instead, it’s a bourgeois intellectual fantasy – an England where the LRB is seriously regarded by its detractors as “a nest of leftists, subversives, pseudo-intellectuals, cosmopolitans, traitors, liars and anti-monarchist vermin”; where perfectly bland ideas are magically imbued with the power to unsettle; and where a talk in a bookshop gets you doorstepped by the red-tops. Finally, Barnes returns to the ambiguity with which we began. Perhaps Neil’s memory and impressions can’t be trusted. Perhaps no memory can be trusted. Perhaps history, as a result, is nothing but interpretation and speculation. Coming as the conclusion to a novel that had begun on firmer ground, this loosening of certainty could have passed for daring subversion. Here, though, it feels like just another evasion – vagueness layered on to vagueness. Elizabeth Finch is a work stubbornly determined to deny us its pleasures, even as it hints at what they could have been.  Sam Byers’ latest novel is Come Join Our Disease (Faber).

4/14/2022,"The London-listed mining company Petropavlovsk has warned investors they may be wiped out though a potential sale, as it struggles to regain its footing after UK sanctions against a key Russian client. The miner said it was facing financial pressures due to UK government restrictions on Gazprombank, which is one of Petropavlovsk’s main customers and buys all of its gold. Gazprombank, which processes most payments for the Russian oil and gas sector, has been subject to UK sanctions since 24 March. Petropavlovsk said it had appointed the restructuring expert AlixPartners to aid the board “as it explores its options and determines the company’s course of action in the best interest of all stakeholders, including creditors and shareholders”. “These options include the sale of the company’s entire interests in its operating subsidiaries as soon as practically possible. It is not currently clear what return, if any, may be secured for shareholders or the holders of the bonds or notes as a result of this process,” it warned. Last month, the Russian billionaire Sergey Sudarikov, who part-owns the sanction-hit Credit Bank of Moscow, bought a 29% stake in Petropavlovsk from its biggest shareholder, Konstantin Strukov, who owns the Russian gold miner UGC. Petropavlovsk was founded as Peter Hambro Mining in 1994 but its eponymous founder was ousted in 2017 after a boardroom coup. The FTSE 250 company said it was exploring whether it could sell gold to other buyers, though that would require Gazprombank to grant a waiver on existing contracts. However, it noted that Russia’s central bank has set gold purchase prices below London rates, which could impact its cashflows, assuming another Russian firm were to commit to purchasing its precious metals. Petropavlovsk has also run into trouble on its loans, since it is barred from making payments to Gazprombank. The miner has a $200m (£152m) loan from the lender, including a $86.7m revolving credit facility, but was barred from paying a $560,000 interest payment last month after the lender was put on the UK sanctions list. Russia is rumoured to be preparing laws that would make it a criminal offence for companies to refuse to deal with local companies because of foreign sanctions. “If such legislation is enacted, the board may not be able to ensure that its subsidiaries will comply with the regulations in Russia,” Petropavlovsk said.",News/Business,"Petropavlovsk investors could be wiped out by sale, warns mining firm ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/petropavlovsk-investors-could-be-wiped-out-by-sale-warns-mining-firm
