3/16/2022,"It sure seems like we've seen the Russo-Ukrainian war before — the story of a seemingly superior Great Power military invading an apparently weaker underdog nation, only to find itself stymied by the irregular tactics and fierce nationalism of the defenders. ""The Russians were not ready for unconventional warfare,"" Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told The Washington Post, adding, ""They are not sure how to deal with this insurgency, guerilla-warfare-type situation."" If that's the case, Russian leaders have short memories. They should remember the Soviet Union's doomed war against Afghanistan, which ended in 1989 after a decade of brutal fighting against insurgents. For that matter, weren't they watching just a few months ago when the United States exited Afghanistan, undone by the exact same dynamic? Is nobody paying attention? There is some speculation that Russian President Vladimir Putin took precisely the wrong lesson from those defeats. ""I reckon he thought he'd roll into Kyiv the way the Taliban rolled into Kabul,"" Zoya Sheftalovich, a contributing editor for Politico's Europe edition, wrote in February. ""Thought ordinary Ukrainians wouldn't resist. No bloodshed. Clean."" Or perhaps Putin became overconfident because of his own country's bloody devastation of opposition forces in Syria. If either of those theories reflects Putin's mindset, though, it's clear he misread both events. Russia's leader might have thought that he, like the Taliban, was reclaiming a piece of his own country by invading Ukraine — but it's now clear Ukrainians think otherwise. And while the Russians were dominant in Syria, they had the benefit of being allied with the regime pre-dating their involvement. The Ukrainians, meanwhile, are mostly united against the invaders. But it also seems to be the case that Great Power militaries build their forces for great army-on-army battles; guerilla warfare doesn't play to either their strengths or preferences. ""On one hand, the great power intrinsically brings overwhelmingly superior resources and technology to this type of conflict,"" then-Major Robert M. Cassidy wrote in a 2002 journal article, Why Great Powers Fight Small Wars Badly. ""On the other hand, the seemingly inferior opponent generally exhibits superior will, demonstrated by a willingness to accept higher costs and to persevere against many odds."" That's a lesson grounded in history — going back, as Cassidy noted, all the way to the Roman Empire. It's also rooted in lived experience: In modern times, the United States ignored the experience of the French in Vietnam, only to get a crash course in counterinsurgency fighting, then promptly forgot everything and have to learn it all over again in Iraq and Afghanistan. All of this means the Russian war is — like most wars — a failure of historical memory. More embarrassing to Putin and his cronies: It's recent history. And if that history is any guide, we'll also soon forget its lessons again.

3/16/2022,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Fractures around Bob Saget's eye sockets and bleeding around his brain were possibly caused by the comedian hitting “something hard, covered by something soft,"" such as a carpeted floor, according to a report released Tuesday that provides more details of the TV's star's death. In the incident report released by the Orange County Sheriff's Office in Orlando, a detective notes that Medical Examiner Joshua Stephany said the fractures “would have stunned Mr. Saget,” and that he would have experienced dizziness. Had he been with people at the time, they would have noticed ""confusion, balance, and/or slurred speech,” the report states. It does not pinpoint a location for Saget's fall. The medical examiner concluded after the autopsy in January that Saget died from an accidental blow to the head, likely from a backwards fall. Investigators called to the luxury hotel suite found no evidence of struggle, foul play or signs that anyone else had been in Saget’s suite during his stay. A toxicology analysis didn’t show any illicit drugs or toxins in Saget’s body. There were no signs of blood on the hotel bed's sheets or bedspread, according to the report released Tuesday. An initial examination of Saget’s body in the hotel suite showed that he had slight swelling and small bruises in the corner of his left eye. “There were no other indications of any type of trauma or injury,” the report states. The 65-year-old entertainer was found by a hotel security officer on his hotel bed at the Ritz Carlton in Orlando on Jan. 9 after he had failed to check out of the hotel and his family had asked for a well-being check. A hotel maintenance worker had to be called to open the door to Saget's suite since it had been latched from inside. Even though the door between Saget's suite and the adjacent room was found to be unlocked, records on the electronic locks at the hotel showed that no one had been in the abutting room since Jan. 7, two days before Saget's body was discovered, the report says. Best known for his role as beloved single dad Danny Tanner on the sitcom “Full House” and as the wisecracking host of “America’s Funniest Home Videos,” Saget was married to Kelly Rizzo Saget and had three daughters from a previous marriage. Saget was on the road as part of his “I Don’t Do Negative Comedy Tour,” and said just before his death that he enjoyed warm audience receptions in Orlando and the Ponte Vedra Beach resort area. A judge in Florida on Monday agreed to make permanent an order that prohibits the release of photos, video or other records related to the investigation into Saget's death. Saget's family had filed a lawsuit seeking the order. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP",U.S./Associated Press,Saget's fractures possibly caused by fall on carpeted floor,https://news.yahoo.com/sagets-fractures-possibly-caused-fall-164603499.html
3/16/2022,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A little-known Republican congressman from Nebraska will begin a high-profile trial Wednesday in California over accusations by federal prosecutors that he lied about illegal campaign contributions from a Nigerian billionaire. The trial of U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry in Los Angeles will be the first of a sitting member of Congress in 21 years and could all but end the political career of a congressman seen as a reliable conservative who coasted to easy wins but isn't a familiar name outside of Nebraska. Fortenberry, who is running for reelection, took a big political hit when prosecutors announced the charges, and his indictment has already divided Nebraska Republicans who backed him for years. “You have people on both sides,"" said Philip Young, a longtime Republican campaign and public relations consultant in Lincoln. “If he's acquitted, that probably makes the decision tougher for a lot of Republicans. If he's convicted, it's much more of an uphill climb for him politically.” Many prominent Nebraska Republicans have already dumped the nine-term incumbent in favor of a young, conservative state lawmaker who wants to oust Fortenberry in the party’s May 10 primary. State Sen. Mike Flood, a former speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, jumped into the race amid concerns that Fortenberry’s indictment could cost the GOP an otherwise safe seat. The 1st Congressional District runs through a large stretch of rural, eastern Nebraska, but also includes the liberal-leaning city of Lincoln. Nebraska state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks, a progressive state lawmaker from Lincoln, is likely to win the Democratic nomination for the district. Flood has won the endorsements of Gov. Pete Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Another leading Republican, Lt. Gov. Mike Foley, has stood behind Fortenberry. Fortenberry has pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he intentionally misled FBI agents and prosecutors who were investigating a $30,000 donation from a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent, Gilbert Chagoury, during a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles. Prosecutors allege Fortenberry lied about what he knew on two occasions — an interview at his Lincoln home and a follow-up meeting in Washington — and didn’t properly disclose the contribution in his campaign filings. Fortenberry has argued the prosecution is politically motivated, that he was misled by authorities and that he wasn’t aware that his statements to authorities were untrue. However, the judge overseeing the case has ruled that the congressman's attorneys can't argue that the prosecution is political. Fortenberry's trial is expected to last around four days. Fortenberry campaign spokesman Chad Kolton claimed prosecutors knew the congressman didn't know details about the contribution, but directed an informant to feed him the information in a 10-minute phone call “with the intention of trying to prosecute him.” Kolton argued FBI agents then used false pretenses to interview Fortenberry nearly a year later, and indicted him when he failed to recall all of the details from the phone conversation. “Jeff Fortenberry has always had great faith in the American people's ability to judge what is fair and just,"" Kolton said. “When the jury hears the facts in this case, they will recognize his innocence."" Fortenberry was first elected to the House in 2004 after a brief stint on the Lincoln City Council and work as a local publishing executive. As a congressman, Fortenberry has been a reliably conservative vote and gained attention as an advocate for Yazidis, a persecuted religious minority from Iraq with a large population in Lincoln. He also sponsored a new federal law that promotes research and new treatments for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS and Lou Gehrig’s disease. Fortenberry’s lawyers have also tried, and failed, to move the trial to Nebraska, where he would likely have gotten a friendlier, Republican-leaning jury. In Democrat-heavy Los Angeles, it’s unlikely jurors will have ever heard Fortenberry’s name. Kenneth Gross, an election law expert and former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, said criminal cases against sitting members of Congress are rare but that Fortenberry faces a tough challenge. “The jury pool can make a difference,” Gross said. “Let’s put it this way. There’s a reason they tried hard to move the case.” Gross said all cases involving allegations of election crimes must be cleared through the Department of Justice’s main office in Washington and that part of the agency is used to defending itself against allegations of political bias. “In this regard, Congressman Fortenberry will have an uphill battle, particularly with a trial in Los Angeles,” Gross said. Federal prosecutors nationwide had a 99.7% conviction rate in their last fiscal year, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. In the California district where Fortenberry is charged, prosecutors secured 489 convictions and lost one case. Many of the guilty verdicts were due to plea agreements that defendants accepted to avoid going to trial, an option Fortenberry has so far rejected. If he’s convicted, Fortenberry wouldn’t automatically lose his seat, but House rules would bar him from voting in any committee or on the floor. He has already stepped down temporarily from his position as the ranking member of the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, as required by House Republican rules. Fortenberry could also lose at least part of his congressional pension under federal anti-corruption laws. A conviction would cost him the “creditable service” accrued in office that helps determine the size of his retirement annuity. A House ethics committee has already created an investigative panel to review the case, as required by House rules, but is deferring any action until after Fortenberry’s trial so it doesn’t interfere with that process. Members of Congress who violate internal ethics rules can face sanctions ranging from a reprimand letter to being expelled from office, said Brian Svoboda, a Washington attorney who specializes in campaign finance law and House ethics investigations. Svoboda said expulsions are extraordinarily rare because members usually resign from office before it can happen. Congress has only expelled five of its members in U.S. history. The last expulsion was of Rep. James Traficant in 2002 after the Ohio Democrat was convicted of bribery, corruption, tax evasion and other charges. Traficant represented himself at his trial in 2001. “Typically, when a member is convicted of a crime, that creates strong momentum toward expulsion,” Svoboda said. ___ Follow Grant Schulte on Twitter: https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte",Politics/Associated Press,Nebraska congressman faces high-stakes trial in California,https://news.yahoo.com/nebraska-congressman-faces-high-stakes-162055100.html
3/16/2022,"Activists said they seized an eight-bedroom villa in southwestern France and posted videos from inside. It is owned by Kirill Shamalov, the ex-husband of Putin's daughter, Russian news site The Insider reported. The activists, who were briefly arrested, say they want to house Ukrainian refugees in the villa. A group of activists said they took over a French seaside villa belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin's former son-in-law, saying they want to use it to house Ukrainian refugees. Pierre Haffner, Vladimir Osechkin, and Sergey Saveliev posted videos and images showing an activist flying the Ukrainian flag from the balcony of the Alta Maria villa in Biarritz on Sunday. The house, which the activists said has eight bedrooms and three bathrooms, is registered to Kirill Shamalov, the independent Russian investigative website The Insider reported. Shamalov was previously married to Katerina Tikhonova, one of Putin's daughters. The villa was previously registered to the Russian oligarch Gennady Timchenko, The Insider reported. Insider was not able to independently verify the property ownership details. Haffner told The Insider that they had found a copy of Shamalov's passport inside the property. Here's a video of Saveliev walking inside the villa compound. Here's a video showing images from inside the mansion, according to Haffner. On Monday, Biarritz police arrested Haffner and Saveliev in connection with the break-in, but later released them with a warning, Agence France-Presse and Reuters reported. In their social media posts, the activists said they changed the locks and hoped to house Ukrainian refugees in the villa. They also said they will go to IKEA to get furnishings. ""In the coming days, human rights activists and lawyers will send relevant requests to the Biarritz Mayor's Office and the prefecture, as well as the Elysee Palace with a proposal to use the villa 'Ukraine' as one of the places to accommodate refugees from Ukraine,"" Osechkin wrote on Facebook. In a statement sent to Osechkin by Saveliev before he entered the villa, Saveliev said: ""We dedicate this action to Ukraine and all the people who have suffered from torture, corruption and repression in Russia."" ""This place should and will become a refuge and a place of help for people who have no place in their country."" World powers including the US, UK, and EU seized the assets of a number of Russians linked to Putin following the invasion of Ukraine last month. The UK government said it was looking at housing Ukrainian refugees in seized properties. Shamalov has not been targeted by EU sanctions, but he has been sanctioned by Britain.

3/16/2022,"Getty Images COVID-19 at-home test Experts are warning that the United States will soon see another spike in COVID-19 cases as wastewater samples in parts of the country show an increase in infections and the BA.2 subvariant spreads in Europe. Cases are climbing in the United Kingdom — up 48% in the last week — and in more than half of countries in the European Union. The change appears to be due to several causes: the BA.2 subvariant of omicron, which is even more transmissible; the removal of pandemic mitigation efforts like mask mandates; and waning immunity from vaccination or prior infection. Past COVID-19 surges hit Europe first before spreading to the U.S. about two weeks later, making their rise in cases a warning sign of what's to come, especially as nearly all of the U.S. moves towards a new post-pandemic life without mask mandates or vaccine requirements. ""Without a doubt, opening up society and having people mingle indoors is clearly something that is a contributor, as well as overall waning immunity, which means we've really got to stay heads-up and keep our eye on the pattern here,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN. ""So that's the reason why we're watching this very carefully."" RELATED: Pfizer CEO Says Fourth Dose of COVID Vaccine 'Is Necessary,' Working on Vaccine for 'All Variants' The U.S. is also starting to see an increase of COVID-19 in wastewater samples, a strong early predictor of when the virus is about to spike. Between Feb. 24 and March 10, the presence of COVID-19 increased by 100% or more in 37% of U.S. wastewater sites, according to the Centers for Disease Control's tracking system. With asymptomatic or untested people able to shed the virus, wastewater samples can capture a more accurate idea of how much COVID-19 is circulating in an area than testing positivity rates.

Andy Slavitt, a former senior advisor on COVID-19 to the White House, said in a Twitter thread that this anticipated rise in cases means that anyone who hasn't had omicron and hasn't been boosted should do that now, and any kids who are not vaccinated should get it, ""particularly now that schools don't require masking.""

3/16/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - When the air-raid siren went off mid-funeral on Tuesday there was no pause from the priest and scarcely a blink from mourners, who ignored the threat of Russian missiles to bury loved ones killed by them two days before. Inside the baroque Saints Peter and Paul Garrison Church in Lviv, hundreds assembled to pay their respects to four soldiers, including one who had buried his brother only days before. All were among the 35 killed by a Russian air strike on Yavoriv military base on Sunday, in which missiles penetrated farther into Ukraine than at any time during the three-week conflict, landing just 20km from the border with Poland. Mothers hugged the coffins as weeping family members laid flowers – some blue and yellow after the Ukrainian flag - atop the polished wood. Pallbearers carried away the bodies of Oleh Yashchyshyn, Kyrylo Vyshyvanyi, Rostyslav Romanchuk and Serhiy Melnyk. Three were laid to rest at the military memorial of the city's historic Lychakiv Cemetery, the most famous cemetery in Ukraine, while a fourth went to his family's plot in a small village near Lviv. It was the second blow within a fortnight for Vyshyvanyi’s family, who buried his younger brother Vasyl on March 4. Also a soldier, he was killed near the southern city of Mykolayiv, hundreds of kilometers away. The most senior of those killed was Oleh Yashchyshyn, whose daughter was also in Yavoriv but was not seriously wounded. One child carried a teddy bear, the words 'Love, Love, Love' imprinted on a strap around her shoulder. As the priest assured their families that the quartet's loss was not in vain, the choir chanted the encomium ""Memory Eternal"" in Ukrainian.

She falsely claimed to be the daughter of a diplomat or an oil baron. Prosecutors said Sorokin falsified records and lied to get banks to lend, luxury hotels to let her stay and well-heeled Manhattanites to cover plane tickets and other expenses for her, stealing $275,000 in all.
