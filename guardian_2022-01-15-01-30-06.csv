1/15/2022,"The seditious conspiracy charges against the leader of the Oath Keepers militia and 10 others related to the January 6 Capitol attack have revealed an armed plot against American democracy that involved tactical planning and a formidable arsenal of weapons. Court documents unsealed Thursday provide the most detailed account to date of the level of planning by the far-right militia in the assault on the Capitol that was aimed at scuppering the certification of Joe Biden’s election win.  The documents describe the creation of rapid-response teams of armed militia members, the deployment of tactical gear and the stockpiling of weapons in a deliberate attempt to overturn the election of Democrat Joe Biden, who beat Donald Trump. On January 6 thousands of pro-Trump rioters stormed the building injuring police officers and sending lawmakers fleeing. Five people died around the events, including a Capitol police officer and a Trump supporter shot by law enforcement. The attempt to stop Biden from becoming president failed. The federal indictment alleges Stewart Rhodes, founder of the Oath Keepers, a far-right extremist group, conspired with 10 other members to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power. The group stationed armed members on the outskirts of Washington to serve as so-called “quick reaction force” teams. The Oath Keepers even discussed a naval operation to ferry in guns to the militia. One Oath Keeper, Thomas Caldwell, asked fellow members if anyone had a boat that could handle crossing the Potomac river. “If we had someone standing by at a dock ramp (one near the Pentagon for sure) we could have our Quick Response Team with the heavy weapons standing by, quickly load them and ferry them across to the river to our waiting arms,” the documents quoted him as saying. Rhodes went on a buying spree in the days leading up to the attack, spending more than $20,000 on guns and equipment for the attack. In December Rhodes bought two pairs of night-vision goggles and a weapons sight for about $7,00 and shipped them to Virginia. In January he spent another $5,000 on a shotgun, scope, magazine, sights, optics, a bipod, a mount, a case of ammunition and gun cleaning supplies. Two days later he spent $6,000 more, and then about $4,500 the next day. In group chats the Oath Keepers discussed how their quick reaction force (QRF) teams would set up at the Comfort Inn in Ballston Arlington, Virginia, to “use as its base of operations for January 6, 2021”. They reserved three rooms; one was occupied by the so-called North Carolina “QRF” team while Arizona and Florida “QRF teams” stayed in the two others. They used the hotel rooms to store firearms and ammunition. “It’s easy to dismiss a lot of what is in the inducement as fantasy, as projection of what the Oath Keepers would like to see, but the events of January 6 remind us that these things can become reality very quickly,” said Devin Burghart, executive director of Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights, a group that monitors far-right extremist groups. “The dangers are there irrespective of their ability to bring all of their fantasies to fruition,” said Burghart. The planning for some kind of operation appeared to begin right after the election last November, as Trump baselessly disputed the results of the election. Two days after the election Rhoades invited some members of the Oath Keepers to a group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app, that was titled “Leadership intel sharing secured”. Rhoades texted the group: “We aren’t getting through this without a civil war. Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body and spirit.” On 7 November 2020, when Trump was finally projected to have lost the election, Rhodes began plotting, texting the group chat: “We must now do what the people of Serbia did when Milosevic stole their election. Refuse to accept it and march en-mass on the nations Capitol.” Rhodes then shared a video on Bitchute, an alt-tech video platform, of a step by step procedure of how to overthrow a government based on the Serbian example. Two days later Rhodes held an online conference with Oath Keepers members outlining a plan to overturn the election. Two days later after that a member of the group, Caldwell, reached out to Rhodes to share the results of a “recce” – a military colloquialism for reconnaissance operation – to Washington and begin planning for an upcoming “op” to the Capitol. From there members began working together. In late November, the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers held a training on “unconventional warfare”. “It will be a bloody and desperate fight. We are going to have a fight. That can’t be avoided,” Rhodes wrote in a group chat with members in December. On 21 December 2020, Oath Keepers mentioned January 6 for the first time. James Wakins, one of the 11 Oath Keepers charged in the case, texted the signal chat about a “National call to action for DC Jan 6th” and said Oath Keepers from three states were mobilizing “Everyone in this channel should understand the magnitude of what I just said,” Wakins wrote. Rhodes told a regional Oath Keeper leader that if Biden assumed the presidency, “We will have to do a bloody, massively bloody revolution against them. That’s whats going to have to happen.” At 6.27am on the morning of January 6 Rhodes texted the group chat: “We will have several well equipped QRF’s outside D.C.” At about 8.30am Rhodes and other Oath Keepers left from their hotel and drove to the Capitol in Washington DC. The teams that stayed behind in a hotel in Virginia discussed the possibility of “armed conflict” and “guerrilla war”. At the Capitol, Oath Keepers marched in formation wearing tactical gear including protective vests, helmets and eye goggles as they carried radios, chemical sprays and hard knuckle gloves. In the group chat one member shared the rumor that it was leftwing groups that had breached the Capitol. “Nope I’m right here, these are Patriots,” replied Rhodes. Rhodes never entered the Capitol, but other members of the Oath Keepers did. Jessica Watkins texted in one of the Oath Keepers group chats: “We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it. They are throwing grenades, they are freaking shooting people with paint balls. But we are in here.” Another member replied with enthusiastic expletives that this what they “trained for”. The indictment reads that Watkins and other Oath Keepers in one formation joined a mob pushing against a line of law enforcement officers in a hallway containing the Rotunda to the Senate chamber, Watkins commanded those around her to “Push, push, push … get in there, get in there.”",News/US news,Oath Keepers leader’s charges detail armed plot against US democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/14/oath-keepers-leader-charges-armed-plot-us-capitol-attack
1/15/2022,"Another extraordinary day in the Novak Djokovic saga began at 5.52pm local time when Australia’s minister for immigration, Alex Hawke, exerted his personal powers to cancel the men’s world No 1’s visa for the second time. In a statement Hawke said he had done so “on health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so”.  Hawke’s decision also quashed a federal court’s decision on Monday that had allowed Djokovic to stay in Australia after he had his visa initially revoked on 6 January. However three hours later the parties were back in the federal court, again in front of Judge Kelly for an urgent court directions hearing, which finished shortly after 11pm. Three things. First it was confirmed that Djokovic will meet immigration officials at 8am local time on Saturday, after which he could decide to leave Australia – although such a scenario appears unlikely. If the 34-year-old stays, his legal team and the Australian government will then face each other in court on Sunday morning for a third time in a full hearing. Finally, Djokovic’s lawyer also revealed that the Australian government wants the Serb deported as they believe his presence could “excite anti-vaccination sentiment” – a claim he described as “patently irrational”. Probably not. As Prof Jack Anderson, the director of sports law at the University of Melbourne explains: “We only got a glimpse of the lawyers’ arguments on Friday. There is no doubt that Djokovic’s lawyers are cherry picking, or reinterpreting, the minister’s reasoning. Of course that’s their job, but we haven’t seen the minister’s reasoning in full yet.” “In some ways it is pretty straightforward,” says Anderson. “The minister has said that he’s cancelling Djokovic’s visa in the public interest and on health and safety grounds, and under the law he has very broad discretion. “That leaves Djokovic’s team with a very narrow judicial review application to make. They will try to find a way to argue that elements of the minister’s decision are not reasonable – and, in fact, are so irrational that it should be quashed and Djokovic’s visa reinstated.” Highly unlikely. As Anderson points out, Djokovic’s legal team asked for the case to be heard on Sunday, the government agreed, and both sides have agreed on an expedited hearing where they will have an hour to present their arguments before a judge decides whether Djokovic can stay or go. And that will be it. Good question. “It’s more likely than not that Djokovic has to leave Australia,” says Anderson. “In some ways all the Australian government has to do is show that they acted reasonably and rationally. The case is not about whether a court should have done something differently. It’s whether Hawke has properly instructed himself on the facts and the evidence. “That makes it easier for the government side,” adds Anderson. “But Djokovic’s legal team is very sharp. And if you look back at the original decision. It was not something that people imagined would happen. You would expect, looking at judicial reviews of migration cases in Australia generally, that the government will survive this one. Although we’ve never quite had an application like this.” A recent poll found that 83% want Djokovic deported. “The slow drip-drip of information about Djokovic’s behaviour in Serbia after his positive test on 16 December and the breaches of federal regulations by entering Spain has had an impact,” explains Anderson. “That is balanced by an embarrassment over the way the Australian government has done this. But definitely public sentiment is not in favour of Djokovic.”",Sport/Sport,"Novak Djokovic Q&A: a wild day, what happens next and the legal view",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/novak-djokovic-qa-a-wild-day-what-happens-next-and-the-legal-view
1/15/2022,"The government is to push ahead with controversial changes to languages teaching in schools, which would see pupils in England memorising lists of 1,700 words to pass GCSEs in Spanish, French or German. The decision by the Department for Education (DfE) comes despite opposition from language associations, teaching unions, and headteachers at state and independent schools, as well as concerns it could cause an exodus of languages teachers from the profession.  Simon Hyde, the general secretary of the Headmasters’ and Mistresses’ Conference of independent schools, said his members feared the narrow focus on grammar and vocabulary would put pupils off studying modern foreign languages (MFL). “This model will not give students the confidence in their language, both at examination level and as a life skill, to take forward into further studies, careers and personal endeavours,” Hyde said. The initial proposals, published in a consultation last year, were criticised for stripping out cultural topics from the proposed course content and replaced with lists of words to be memorised. While the DfE has made some concessions in its final proposals, one academic dismissed the revisions as “a nod” to the earlier criticisms. The Association for Language Learning said it was “very disappointed” that the DfE had not taken up an invitation to work collaboratively with subject associations, exam boards and headteachers on a further review of GCSE content and development. School leaders said they were grateful for the DfE’s decision to delay the introduction of the reformed curriculum until September 2024, meaning that the first GCSEs with the new content would be sat in spring 2026, to be taken by pupils currently in year 7. The DfE said its consultation received 1,644 responses, with the majority “from language teachers agreeing with the proposals”. Robin Walker, the schools minister for England, said studying languages was “hugely important” for the global economy: “That’s why we want more young people to take up modern language GCSEs, and these evidence-based changes aim to do just that – making these qualifications more well-rounded and accessible, and helping more young people to enjoy learning languages.” The DfE said students will be assessed on 1,200 words or “word families” – for example, counting grand and grande in French as the same word – at foundation-tier GCSE and 1,700 words or “word families” in higher tier, taken from the 2,000 most common words used in a language’s conversations and writing, as well as grammar and pronunciation. But Katrin Kohl, professor of German at the University of Oxford, said: “There’s no pedagogic precedent for using vocabulary frequency as the key driver for subject content, and as has been widely emphasised, the approach isn’t tested at GCSE level. “Vocabulary frequency is a statistical measure that is context-dependent, not absolute. It’s hard to see how the subject aims can be met with a narrow range of vocabulary that has been selected on a one-size-fits-all statistical basis, that varies across languages and that is focused on formal language used by adults.” Jim Milton, emeritus professor of applied linguistics at Swansea University, said the focus on most common words ignored that fact that less frequently used words supply most of the content when people communicate. “I once arrived in Outer Mongolia at a hotel where everything was written in Chinese and no one spoke English. I wanted a cold beer but I did not know the words for this. After inventive use of my Chinese, much circumlocution, and some acting out, I was served an omelette,” Milton said.",News/Education,"Plan for pupils to learn 1,700 words for language GCSEs gets go-ahead",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/14/plan-pupils-learn-1700-words-language-gcse-go-ahead
1/15/2022,"A comprehensive review is to be held into how a suspected Chinese agent was able to get so close to senior British politicians, the security minister, Damian Hinds, has said. MI5, the domestic intelligence agency, on Thursday took the unusual step of circulating a warning to MPs accusing Christine Lee – a prominent London-based solicitor – of being engaged in “political interference activities” on behalf of China’s ruling communist regime.  The Chinese embassy rejected the claims, accusing the authorities of “smearing and intimidation” against the Chinese community in the UK, while a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the British were “too obsessed with James Bond 007 movies”. However, Hinds said the security services had been aware of Lee’s activities – including channelling funds to British politicians in an attempt to secure influence – for “some time”. The Times had reported on her activities in 2017, including her extensive payments to the office of Barry Gardiner then the shadow energy minister. It is not clear what prompted M15 to make its surprise statement on Thursday, but, asked about the scale of Chinese influence in the UK, Hinds said on Friday: “We’re learning all the time, all the implications, of course, have to be able to be taken into account.” Much of Hinds’s broadcast round was diverted to questions about further revelations of Downing Street parties, dashing any hopes in government circles that MI5’s warning might draw the media to a new subject. Nevertheless Conservative MPs tried to make political capital out of the revelations, suggesting both Labour and the Liberal Democrats’ approach to Chinese investment in the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, sealed in 2015, may have been influenced by the Chinese. In reality, Gardiner is on the record saying Hinkley was not essential to UK energy needs. The Conservative MP Marcus Fysh claimed: “Chinese government spy agencies have been massively funding frontline Labour and Liberal Democrat political operations in the UK. Energy policy directed by Ed Davey the Liberal Democrat leader and supported by Barry Gardiner has greatly favoured China and this needs to be addressed.” The trade minister Greg Hands said: “This is extremely concerning. I was trade minister. Barry Gardiner was our Labour shadow, and we used to brief him confidentially on complex and sensitive international trade negotiations which certainly would have been of interest to the Chinese government.” Davey’s Kingston constituency party received £5,000 from the Chinese in February 2013 when he was energy secretary. Sir Michael Rake, a member of the board of Huawei UK, also donated £5,000 to Davey in 2020. Gardiner received more than £500,000 from Christine Lee over six years to cover staffing costs in his office as well as employing her son as his diary manager. The son quit his job on Thursday in the wake of the revelations. Lee also received an award from Theresa May when she was prime minister, for her work on a project promoting good relations between the Chinese and British communities in the UK, and was a VIP guest when David Cameron hosted President Xi Jinping in London. Her connections with the Chinese embassy were widely known. Gardiner said he had liaised with the security services for many years regarding his contacts with Lee but had only learned on Thursday that she had been engaged in “illegal activity”. Gardiner had been a supporter of the Chinese investment in UK nuclear power plants, but the current Labour frontbench opposes the potential investment even more than the government. Tim Loughton, one of the four MPs subject to Chinese sanctions said it was “deeply worrying that agents of the Chinese Communist party have been given access to the mother of parliaments and funding the offices of selected politicians. We urgently need an exhaustive audit of where they have bought influence or inveigled their way into virtually every aspect of the U.K. and can then take appropriate measures to roll back that influence.” It is unlikely that Lee will face charges, since the home secretary, Priti Patel, has said her activities fell below the criminal threshold. In the security service interference alert (SSIA) sent to MPs and peers, MI5 said Lee “acted covertly” in co-ordination with the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Chinese Communist party (CCP). It said she had been “engaged in the facilitation of financial donations to political parties, parliamentarians, aspiring parliamentarians, and individuals seeking political office in the UK, including facilitating donations to political entities on behalf of foreign nationals”. The Electoral Commission will be asked to investigate whether these donations breached electoral law since they had in reality come from a foreign power, and not a British citizen. In Beijing, the foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin dismissed the claims, accusing the UK government of making “groundless allegations and hyping the China threat” to serve its own purposes. “It is highly irresponsible to make sensational remarks based on hearsay evidence and certain individual’s conjecture,” he said. The Chinese ambassador was asked for an explanation when he met UK diplomats at the Foreign Office in what is being described as a routine meeting. News of the alert became known when the Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, a frequent critic of China, revealed the Commons Speaker had written to MPs about the MI5 warning.",News/UK news,Damian Hinds says there will be review of suspected Chinese agent’s activities,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/damian-hinds-says-there-will-be-review-of-suspected-chinese-agents-activities
1/15/2022,"The US has alleged Russia has already positioned saboteurs in Ukraine to carry out a “false flag” operation to use as a pretext for a Russian attack, which Washington says could begin in the coming month. The allegations, following similar claims by the government in Kyiv, come after the failure of a week of diplomacy to defuse the crisis provoked by Russia’s massing of more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders. Moscow has persistently portrayed the crisis as a military threat from Ukraine against Russia, without providing any evidence.  “Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine,” a US official said. “We have information that indicates Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine. “Russian influence actors already starting to fabricate Ukrainian provocations in state and social media,” the official said, noting that Russia used similar tactics ahead of the annexation of Crimea in 2014. “The Russian military plans to begin these activities several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February.” Ukrainian officials had claimed that the provocation could take the form of a violent incident at the Russian embassy or consulate, which Moscow could then blame on far-right Ukrainian extremists. The US claim came on the same day Ukraine was hit by a “massive” cyber-attack, with the websites of several government departments including the ministry of foreign affairs and the education ministry knocked out. The hackers left a message on the foreign ministry website, according to reports. It said: “Ukrainians! … All information about you has become public. Be afraid and expect worse. It’s your past, present and future.” Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office in Kyiv said, “practically 90%” of the affected websites were back online by mid-afternoon. “The most strategic infrastructure in Ukraine was not be destroyed by this attack. This is a very [well] protected,” Yermak told a meeting of the Atlantic Council thinktank from Kyiv. He said Ukraine was working with the US and the UK to confirm who was behind the assault. Earlier in the day, Ukraine’s information ministry said “the first data suggest that the attack was carried out by the Russian Federation”. The White House, however, could not immediately confirm that. “We don’t have an attribution at this time,” a US official told reporters. “While we continue to assess the impact with the Ukrainians, it seems limited so far, with websites coming back online. We will consult with allies and partners including Ukraine.”",News/World news,US claims Russia planning ‘false-flag’ operation to justify Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/us-russia-false-flag-ukraine-attack-claim

1/15/2022,"The 66-1 success of Boreham Bill in last season’s Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton Park was a skinner for the bookies but this has been a good race for the punters overall since the trip was extended in 2007, with lightly raced, improving hurdlers holding a clear edge over more experienced handicappers. Marie’s Rock, Gelino Bello and Green Book all arrive with the right profile for Saturday’s renewal, and represent big-name stables that have sent out a Lanzarote winner within the last six years.  Jamie Snowden’s Up For Parol (2.40), though, has as strong a chance as any on paper and seems to have crept in slightly under the radar at around 8-1. Like several recent winners of this race, Up For Parol had an underwhelming stab at chasing earlier in the campaign, but he put up a career-best returned to hurdles at Haydock in December and is just 6lb higher now. He has yet to race over this trip but he is bred to improve for the step up and won a three-mile point-to-point in Ireland as a four-year-old. Warwick 1.18 Two comfortable wins have seen Brave Seasca take a 16lb hike in the ratings but he had plenty in hand at Ascot last time out and a swift hat-trick is likely. Kempton 1.32 Foxboro might well have won but for a last-fence mistake at Wincanton in December and he should go close off a 1lb higher mark here. Warwick 1.50 A 5lb penalty is unlikely to be enough to stop Threeunderthrufive notching up a fourth win from five starts over fences. Kempton 2.05 All four runners go to post with a serious chance but Eldorado Allen has consistency on his side and showed up well behind First Flow at Huntingdon last time. Warwick 2.25 A top-class renewal of this Grade Two novice hurdle with Stag Horn, rated 103 on the Flat, marginally preferred at around 9-2 to back up a successful hurdling debut at Hereford in December. He won with something to spare there and has been gelded since. Warwick 3.00 Padleyourowncanoe made a solid return to action over hurdles after 452 days off last month. Dan Skelton’s runner had promising course form over fences for Colin Tizzard in 2020 and should go well at around 7-1. Kempton 3.15 More negatives than positives for several of these, so perhaps the veteran Double Shuffle, who has an excellent record over track and trip, may be up to repeating his win in this race – off a 1lb lower mark – last year.

1/15/2022,"This was the week in which the Tory party – from cabinet ministers down to grassroots associations – started to believe that the end was nigh for Boris Johnson’s premiership. “The problem is that he has in no way accepted that himself,” says one senior Tory adviser with knowledge of the prime minister’s inner circle.  And so began a period of what one Conservative minister described as prime ministerial “purgatory” – the gap between a leader being politically done for and the moment of their stepping down. Downing Street had hoped to draw a line under the partygate scandal in the new year, after a grim run of headlines and mutinous mood in the Tories before Christmas. But after only a brief respite, the bad news for Johnson resurfaced on Monday night when ITV revealed that Johnson had attended a “bring your own booze” social event in the garden of No 10 to which 100 people were invited. On Wednesday, he had to say sorry in the House of Commons, while several prominent Tories called for his resignation. By Friday morning, Downing Street even found itself apologising to the Queen after it emerged that two other parties were held in No 10 on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral, while the prime minister was away at Chequers. However, some of those who have spoken to Johnson this week say he is not in a mood to give in to what many Tory MPs now see as inevitable. One person present at cabinet on Tuesday said the mood in No 10 was “total denial” about the seriousness of the situation that Johnson faces. Describing a “bizarre” and “farcical” virtual meeting, they said not a single cabinet minister mentioned the political peril that Johnson is facing, as Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gave a presentation on the economy, and Sajid Javid, the health secretary, update on Omicron. The fact that no one was willing to confront the prime minister about how he will dig his way out of the current hole may indicate that cabinet colleagues have already turned their minds to whatever is next – and which of them is best placed to succeed him. However, while most Tory MPs now believe Johnson will be gone before the next election, there is heated disagreement about the best timing for his departure. The clearest way of challenging the prime minister would be for 50 or so MPs to hand in letters of no confidence in him to the 1922 Committee of backbenchers. But some of Johnson’s opponents are worried there is a risk that he could still, despite everything that has happened, secure enough votes among his colleagues, which would mean he would be safe for another year. MPs said another part of the reason for delaying a challenge would be that the leadership teams of possible opponents – such as Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid – do not yet feel completely ready for a contest. They may look at the economic pain on the cost of living about to be inflicted on the country this spring and believe that it would be better to keep Johnson in place for a while longer to “suck up that unpopularity”, said one MP. A no confidence vote would only be likely to succeed with the tacit support of cabinet leadership candidates and the MPs on their list of supporters. Then there are the veteran MPs who have seen prime ministers weather some terrible times and believe the party should hold fire until they have seen whether public anger subsides and the polls settle again, potentially using the local elections as a barometer. Others disagree and believe that it would be harmful to have a lame duck prime minister in place for much longer, and wrongheaded to risk the loss of council seats, arguing that the moment of reckoning should come sooner. This caucus – comprised of many more centrist Tories as well as some 2017 and 2019ers worried about their seats – are pushing for a challenge after the publication of Sue Gray’s report into the parties at No 10 during lockdown, which could be published at the end of next week. MPs said there will be “phone calls and Zooms” in the next few days where they work out their strategy and whether that is the right moment to seek a confidence vote in his leadership. Many MPs are also using the weekend to sound out their constituents and associations. One 2019 Tory MP, Lee Anderson, sent out a message asking people for their views, with a survey of options for people to complete, asking: “a) He has done wrong and apologised. It is time to move on. b) He has done wrong and should go. c) He has done wrong and should have a six-month departure plan.” Setting out his own position, Anderson said: “Personally, I would not back anyone who has knowingly done wrong but I also realise that our country is at a critical point in beating the virus.” Other Tory MPs have written to constituents saying they believe Johnson’s position would be untenable if the Gray report finds serious wrongdoing. But in private, some MPs believe the bar is lower and that he could be pushed out if any new revelations emerge in the Gray report that implicate him in the partying culture. There is also a fear that photos, videos or new disclosures could appear at any time in the media. While backbenchers may be the ones to implement a challenge, the mood of the cabinet will be key. The least supportive has been Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, who issued a statement backing his apology but was marked by its absence of any other supportive comments. But several cabinet ministers still believe Johnson may still be able to find way of turning things around. His greatest defenders among senior colleagues have been Priti Patel, the home secretary, and Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary. Others are reserving judgment until they see how he reacts over the next week or so – and particularly in relation to whether he will show he is willing to overhaul his operation. Colleagues accept that he is a “campaigner, not a manager”, and that he needs better support in No 10, says one cabinet minister. “Boris is staring disaster in the face in a way that he hasn’t done before in his premiership,” he says. “But if anyone on the planet can come back from this, it’s Boris. He does have the characteristics that defy normal expectation.”",News/Politics,Crisis? What crisis?

1/15/2022,"It’s a big weekend in the Premier League, which is The Fiver’s stock opening gambit for very quiet Fridays. But to be fair, it is a big weekend in the Premier League, which is what The Fiver always says to justify trotting out its stock opening gambit for very quiet Fridays. Come the evening, towards the end of this, a very quiet Friday, Brighton host Crystal Palace in the latest edition of the A23 derby, one of only four synthetic confections from the 1970s to still retain cultural cachet in the 21st century, alongside Spangles, Monster Munch, and Son of my Father by Chicory Tip. Hey, does anybody remember, etc.  Palace have had the better of the coffee-infused rivalry in recent times, winning on their previous two visits to Falmer. Brighton are in good form, though, having won two of their last three, so this stramash is nicely unpredictable, not least because the last three meetings have all ended with perception-bending, 90th-minute goals, Brighton scoring a couple of equalisers and Palace securing an absurd smash-and-grab win last February after being thoroughly played off the park. Hey, does anybody remember Mr Roy? A big match all right, yet it’s just a mere curtain raiser for some proper humdingers to follow over the next couple of days. Aston Villa look to play Manchester United off the park for the second time in five days, with a view to maybe getting something out of it this time. In theory, Spurs and Arsenal contest the north London derby, a cauldron at the best of times, never mind with both teams dreaming of a seventh- or even sixth-place finish this year. There are two big relegation six-pointers between Newcastle and Watford, and Norwich and Rafa’s Everton. And perhaps best of all, Chelsea travel to Manchester City, who will wrap up England’s latest anti-climactic title race at approximately 12.47pm on Saturday, when John Stones rolls in their fourth. Yep, big weekend, coming right up (which, for the record, is our stock closing gambit for when we don’t have a pay-off). Join Scott Murray from 8pm for hot Premier League MBM coverage of Brighton 0-0 Crystal Palace. “Thanks to God and the work of these heroes I was saved” – former Mali international Ousmane Coulibaly, who suffered a heart attack on the pitch during a Qatar Stars League match last week, thanks Al Rayyan’s James Rodríguez and Al Wakrah teammate Saoud Al Khater for helping to save his life. “Re: yesterday’s Fiver letters. Reading the first English team to score seven more than once away from home since 1895-96? I must have dreamt Hereford United beating Forest Green Rovers 7-1 and Dagenham and Redbridge 9-0 in 2003-04. Just the 91 points and 103 goals that season, and they still didn’t get promoted” – Neil Turner. “Anwar El Ghazi, completing his move to Everton, says that he wants to put a smile on the faces of the club’s fans. Shortly before Macbeth murders him, King Duncan, reflecting on the treacherous Thane of Cawdor, says: ‘There is no art to find the mind’s construction in the face.’ When would a smile on an Evertonian’s face have anything to do with what is going on on the pitch?

1/15/2022,"Andy Murray described the re-escalation of Novak Djokovic’s visa saga as “not great for tennis, not great for the Australian Open and not great for Novak,” after the Serbian’s hopes of playing in the first grand slam of the year were left hanging by a thread on Friday. Murray was one of a number of current and former players to express their frustration at the ongoing farrago after the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, exercised his powers to revoke Djokovic’s visa for a second time, this time on the basis that by remaining in the country the world No 1 would incite ‘“anti-vaccine sentiment”.  While Djokovic will spend the 48 hours before he is due to play his first match on Monday at the Australian Open being detained at a secret location and watching a final hearing to determine his status, Murray will play in his first ATP Tour final in just over two years. Speaking after defeating Reilly Opelka in the last four of the Sydney Classic, a visibly frustrated Murray said of the topic that has dominated the buildup to the Australian Open: “It’s unfortunate that it’s ended up in this sort of situation … just want it to get resolved. I think it would be good for everyone if that was the case. It just seems like it’s dragged on for quite a long time now, and yeah, not great for the tennis, not great for the Australian Open, not great for Novak.” Boris Becker, who coached Djokovic from 2013 to 2016, acknowledged that “no tennis player is bigger than a tournament,” but also told BBC Sport: “It is a political game he got involved in and that’s unfortunate.” The announcement at close to 6pm on a Friday evening that Djokovic’s visa was being cancelled again had drawn mixed reaction on social media, with many Australians believing it was the right decision to stick to the initial decision by the Australian Border Force the unvaccinated player did not meet federal law and should be deported. Others, however, bemoaned the long drawn-out process that they said allowed Scott Morrison’s government to distract attention from pandemic related supply chain and testing issues. The seven-time grand slam champion, Justine Henin, meanwhile, argued that given most public sentiment seemed to favour the government’s decision, that Djokovic would be better off heading home. “I think it’s the best thing he doesn’t play at the moment,” she said. “When something is so complicated, I don’t say that Djokovic doesn’t have to fight, because he thought it was the right thing to do, but I think now it’s been proved that so many Australian people don’t want him to play. So maybe it’s better for everyone, for tennis, for the tournament, and maybe for him, that he doesn’t play the tournament.” Others, including the well-respected coach Darren Cahill, said that there were no winners amid the fallout and that the sacrifices of the Australian people in enduring long lockdowns and strict vaccine mandates should have been prioritised. “Fault lies everywhere here,” Cahill said. “It’s been a mess. Novak, TA, Vic Gov, Federal Gov. It should’ve been a hard rule entering this country considering what the folks have been thru. Get vaccinated and come play the AO, or if not maybe see you in 23’. No wiggle room.”",Sport/Sport,‘Not great for tennis’: Andy Murray on the Novak Djokovic visa farrago,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/novak-djokovics-visa-saga-not-great-for-tennis-says-andy-murray
1/15/2022,"A vice-president of the European parliament is facing questions after it was revealed he had spent nearly €690,000 (£576,000) on lavish office renovations. Rainer Wieland, a Christian Democrat MEP from Germany, spent €486,011 on a state-of-the-art office and €134,774 “showroom” next door, both built from scratch on the 15th floor of the European parliament in Brussels, according to a leaked report seen by the Guardian.  The “showroom” – that Wieland said was a meeting room that can be used by anyone in the parliament – is equipped with top-range IT equipment, including €42,722 transcription tools and a €26,482 videoconferencing system. The final bill could be even higher if the MEP goes ahead with plans for a €49,864 mobile studio. The veteran MEP oversees the internal management of the European parliament’s buildings and was testing a new office set-up he called an “idea laboratory” to see what features could be extended to all 705 members. “The institution will be able to act in a financially responsible manner, as features that could originally seem useful, but during testing would be ruled out, would not be acquired by the institution,” states an internal report drafted by senior administrators seen by the Guardian. But the staggering costs have rung alarm bells. In order to build the new office, Wieland spent nearly €35,000 demolishing the existing space, dismantling two existing bathrooms, pipes and ventilation systems, as well as windowsills, partitions and false ceilings. His new office was equipped with bespoke doors costing €25,000, a separate sliding door at €14,810 and €57,948-worth of built-in furniture, including a kitchenette with appliances. Inside the office, partitions costing €33,619 change from translucent to opaque at the flick of a switch. Doors are sealed with electronic locks costing €10,968. The “showroom” is equipped with a wall of monitors, a €3,500 table and a €25,000 ceiling light that looks like a window. “It’s nice, this kind of light is very pleasant, it’s also very, very expensive,” said Daniel Freund, a German Green MEP, who is responsible for overseeing the parliament’s 2020 spending. He said he feared the revelations would damage the image of the European parliament. “Looking at this from the perspective of a budget controller, I find it very difficult to justify that kind of expense to the EU taxpayer. I am conscious as well these are bad stereotypes, that there is a perception that the European parliament is expensive … We need to be very conscious of how we spend taxpayer money and this project is not a great example of that.” Freund is also concerned that the plans appeared to have been waved through by senior MEPs, with no fixed budget or tracking of costs. “There has never been a dedicated budget and no budget oversight,” he said. “I want to make sure that the money is spent according to the rules, so that needs to be clarified now with the administration … or the rules need to be changed to make sure projects of this size have proper accountability.” The spending is likely to raise eyebrows among EU member governments, who regularly complain that the parliament demands too much money for unjustified projects. MEPs have offices in Brussels and Strasbourg, which were renovated at a cost of €17.6m in 2019 to update IT and replace furniture. They can also claim expenses for a work space in their constituency. Speaking to the Guardian, Wieland said the project would save taxpayers money. “This is an idea lab where we test ideas, whether they are useful, usable – and we want to think out of the box … I am deeply convinced that testing costs money, but not testing costs also money and sometimes even more.” He added: “Most of the costs which are at stake are behind the walls and it’s not a luxury.” Each MEP’s Brussels office is equipped with a toilet and shower, which Wieland said was “an anachronism” that required staff to run water for 10 minutes every fortnight to prevent legionella. He rejected the term “showroom” from the internal report as misleading, describing the space as “a multifunctional meeting room” that can be used by all MEPs and staffers. He said the parliament had a shortage of medium-sized meeting rooms, adding that such a room may not be on every floor in the future, “because if we test it we also test how strong is the need”. Sources close to the MEP disputed suggestions that the IT equipment should be included in the total costs, claiming that the licences for the videoconferencing system and transcription technology covered the whole parliament. Wieland, who is bidding to be re-elected as a vice-president next week, also defended other elements of the project, saying: “We believe that normal keys are not appropriate any more, [in case] keys are lost.” The €25,000 light fixture was necessary, he said: “If you have high-quality cameras for high-quality communication, then you need high-quality lights.” A spokesperson for the European parliament said a test for an “innovative architectural concept for MEPs offices” had taken place in 2020, adding the size of the project had not allowed for any economies of scale. “After finalisation, evaluations will be carried out whether it would make sense to envisage some of the new features for other offices. Any decision would need the approval by the political and budgetary authorities of the EP.”",News/World news,"£576,000 office renovations will save taxpayers money, EU official insists ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/eu-parliament-vice-president-facing-questions-over-500000-office-renovation
1/15/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open hopes are reliant on him winning a last-ditch appeal after another extraordinary day in which the government cancelled his visa for the second time. Shortly before 6pm in Melbourne on Friday, Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, exercised a personal power to revoke Djokovic’s visa “on health and good order grounds … and on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so”.  It later emerged that one reason why the government wants the men’s world No 1 deported is because they believe his presence could “excite anti-vaccination sentiment”. However the Serb’s legal team said that this was “patently irrational” and immediately applied for an urgent court directions hearing which began less than three hours after Hawke’s decision. Shortly after 11pm, after yet more legal arguments in front of Judge Anthony Kelly, it was finally confirmed that Djokovic would be granted a temporary permission to stay – at least until his expedited case is heard in federal court on Sunday. Before then, Djokovic will also meet with immigration lawyers on Saturday at 8am. There is a small chance he could leave Australia after that, however on Friday it appeared far more likely that he would stay and fight. According to Prof Jack Anderson, the director of sports law at the University of Melbourne, the chances of Djokovic succeeding are small. “All the Australian government has to do is show that it acted reasonably and rationally, while Djokovic’s team have a very narrow judicial review application to make,” he told the Guardian. “They will try to find a way to argue that elements of the minister’s decision are not reasonable – and, in fact, are so irrational that it should be quashed and Djokovic’s visa reinstated.” “Looking at judicial reviews of migration cases in Australia generally, you would expect the government will survive this one,” he added. “Although we’ve never quite had an application like this.” Certainly the stakes are high. The fresh decision to cancel the visa threatens to leave the Australian Open without one of its biggest stars and Djokovic – who was seeking a record-breaking 21st grand slam triumph in the men’s game – unable to defend the title he has won nine times. It also means the 34-year-old could be effectively barred from re-entering the country for three years unless he can show in future bids that compelling circumstances exist, such as compassionate or Australian national interest grounds. Earlier, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that Australians had “made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected”. “This is what the minister is doing in taking this action today,” Morrison said, explaining he would not comment further “due to the expected ongoing legal proceedings”. However at an urgent court directions hearing on Friday evening, Djokovic’s counsel, Nicholas Wood, revealed that Djokovic’s visa had been partly revoked because the government believed he would excite anti-vax sentiment. Wood noted that this was “radically different” from the reason for the first cancellation and argued there was “no rational basis” for the conclusion. Although Djokovic is not vaccinated, he has not actively promoted anti-vax disinformation. However, Australian anti-vaxxers have been using the hashtag #IStandWithDjokovic on social media. Wood also expressed concern at Djokovic’s safety and a potential “media circus” when his client is due to be taken into detention after an interview with immigration officials. Meanwhile speaking after his semi-final victory in the Sydney Tennis Classic, Andy Murray described Djokovic’s visa saga as “not great for tennis, not great for the Australian Open, not great for Novak”. “I’m not going to sit here and start kicking Novak whilst he’s down,” Murray said. “I just want it to get resolved. It would be good for everyone if that was the case.” The Djokovic saga began when he was detained after arriving in the country on the evening of 5 January. The world No 1 had believed that a visa granted on 18 November and an exemption approved by Tennis Australia’s chief medical officer and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. However he was then told that a recent Covid infection by itself was not sufficient for an exemption from Australia’s strict vaccination requirements and that he posed a risk to public health. After four days in an immigration hotel, a federal circuit court judge restored Djokovic’s visa on Monday, concluding it was unreasonable for the Australian Border Force to renege on a deal to give him more time at the airport to address the exemption issue. Since then it has also emerged that Djokovic made several public appearances after his positive Covid diagnosis of 16 December and that he travelled from Serbia to Spain over Christmas before flying to Melbourne – despite declaring on his visa he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia. Der Spiegel also claimed anomalies suggested the positive result could have been negative or dated 26 December. On Wednesday, Djokovic conceded his agent made an “administrative mistake” when declaring he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia and acknowledged an “error of judgment” by not isolating after he tested positive for Covid. However opinion in Australia has since turned sharply against him. A survey of 60,000 people carried out by NewsCorp before Hawke’s decision showed that 83% wanted Djokovic to be deported.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic’s slim Australian Open hopes reliant on last-ditch appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/novak-djokovic-australian-open-hopes-reliant-on-last-ditch-appeal
1/15/2022,"Bob Hughes, Lord Hughes of Woodside, who has died aged 90, was a Labour MP for 27 years and a key figure in the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM), which he chaired for two decades until the organisation was wound up in 1995 following democratic elections in South Africa. A self-effacing figure on the Tribunite left of the party, Hughes was a minister in Harold Wilson’s 1974 government but was the first to resign in protest against cuts in public expenditure. However, that step opened up a hugely productive phase in Hughes’s life. He was soon asked to become chairman of the AAM and spent the next 20 years as a valued friend and ally of liberation leaderships in southern Africa.  His principled yet emollient style made him an ideal figure to lead an organisation that accommodated a vast range of political perspectives and its fair share of strong personalities. London was the worldwide focal point for opposition to apartheid, and Hughes had no doubt in later life about the role that the AAM had played, particularly by promoting economic boycotts of the Pretoria regime. After his release from prison in 1990, Nelson Mandela visited supporters and politicians around the world and members of the AAM leadership gathered at his hotel in London. “Mike Terry, Trevor Huddleston and myself went to meet him,” recalled Hughes. “While we were waiting, Mrs Thatcher twittered in. We’d have strangled her, never mind granting her an audience. But he [Mandela] has always shown such magnanimity.” Bob’s long tenure as AAM chairman confirmed the widespread esteem in which he was held. Once the organisation was wound up, having fulfilled its purpose, he became chairman of the archives committee that undertook the massive task of collating the movement’s documentary records over a 50-year period as a contribution towards an historical understanding of the period. They were then transferred to Rhodes House Library in Oxford. Hughes was born in the Fife fishing village of Pittenweem, the home territory of his father, Mitchell Hughes. His mother, Jessie (nee Anderson), was also from a fishing community, Whitehills in Banffshire. The family moved first to Aberdeen, where his father was a marine engineer. It was their decision to emigrate to South Africa in 1946 that was to galvanise Bob’s later political career. At first, the teenage boy regarded the warmth and brightness of life at Benoni in the eastern Transvaal as a considerable improvement on the postwar gloom he had left behind. After leaving Pietermaritzburg Technical College, Natal, he completed an apprenticeship as an engineer at the South African Rubber Company in a place called Howick, which was heavily populated by Scots. Bob became involved in trade union activity and, though apartheid was not formalised until 1948, separate development was already an entrenched reality and the contrast between the conditions of whites and blacks horrified him. He left South Africa in 1954, but said later that it was “the cataclysmic experience of seeing there how people lived that started me on the process of becoming a socialist”. Back in Aberdeen to further his engineering studies at Robert Gordon’s College (now Robert Gordon University), he joined the Labour League of Youth and fought his first parliamentary election in 1959, standing in North Angus and Mearns against Sir Colin Thornton-Kemsley, on the grounds that he was the only one who turned up for the selection conference. He was then recruited to the AUEW engineering union’s list of sponsored candidates and became deeply immersed in Aberdeen local government. Elected to Aberdeen corporation in 1962, he retained a lifelong pride in the city’s progressive record in housing, health and education. It was, for example, the first local authority in Britain to sponsor family planning clinics, though an attempt in the early 1960s to establish an occupational workshop for people with learning difficulties was turned down by the Tory secretary of state for Scotland on the quite open grounds that it would be detrimental to house values around it. When Hector Hughes, MP in the rock-solid Labour seat of Aberdeen North, was nearing retirement, Bob was an obvious successor. He was elected in 1970 and became first a frontbench spokesman and then a Scottish Office minister in 1974. It was a brief tenure, however, as Hughes found Wilson’s style of government “very difficult to live with”. He was not prepared to argue publicly in favour of an incomes policy supposed to prevent public expenditure cuts but also “sit in my own office and at the same time work out the next five years of public expenditure cuts”. As the Bennite left came to the fore after the 1979 Labour defeat, Hughes deeply resented litmus tests of socialist purity and denunciations of treachery for failure to support some fashionable cause, when they came from people who had “sat tight” during the Wilson years. It was, he recalled, Tribunite MPs such as Norman Buchan, Joan Lestor and himself who had made the sacrifice of resignation. Much against his instincts, Hughes went to the House of Lords in 1997 and remained an active, working peer. He was a vice-president of the British Humanist Association and a devoted follower of Aberdeen football club. In 2004 Hughes was honoured by South Africa as a Companion of the Order of Oliver Tambo. His wife, Margaret (nee Miller), whom he married in 1957, died in 2021. Hughes is survived by their two sons and three daughters.
