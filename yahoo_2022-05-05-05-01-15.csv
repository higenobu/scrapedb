5/5/2022,"Even though $5 million is a significant sum, having a nest egg that size for retirement still requires that it be handled in a prudent manner. Here are several ways to make sure that such an amount covers your wants as well as needs after you've stopped the 9-to-5 routine. One of the wisest moves you can make to ensure that you can do what you want in retirement is to work with a financial advisor in developing a retirement roadmap to guide you for the two or three decades you'll be drawing on that nest egg.

Sign up today. Step One is making a plan. That's something many retirees, including wealthy ones, don't do. According to Northwestern Mutual’s 2020 Planning & Progress Study, nearly half (40%) of U.S. adults don’t have a clear idea of their current spending limits now versus what their spending limits will be later. They are unsure of where to draw the line so that they can save for later. As a result, 27% report holding back while another 22% spend without knowing and hope they still have enough. The study also found that 71% of Americans feel that their financial plan could use improvement, but only 29% work with an advisor. Creating a financial plan starts with creating a retirement budget. That can reveal if your $5,000,000 can cover the type of lifestyle you plan to enjoy for the next 20 or 30 years. The budget should account for basic living expenses including housing, food, utilities and transportation, as well as healthcare, hobbies and travel. If you have no idea where to begin, review your current spending patterns. Try tracking your spending for at least six months and then ask yourself some key questions, such as: Is what you’re spending now likely similar to what you’ll spend in retirement? Are there any expenses you have now that may increase or decrease when you retire? Any that could disappear altogether? Are there expense categories you don’t have now that you might add to your budget when you retire? These questions will provide insight into what it will cost to maintain your standard of living in retirement and help you decide a realistic draw down rate. Sometimes experts recommend withdrawing 4% of your retirement assets or less each year to ensure the money lasts. Assuming you have $5,000,000 in retirement, you could realistically withdraw $200,000 your first year of retirement. That amount would shrink incrementally each subsequent year, assuming zero portfolio growth. There are several reasons to considering downsizing. It reduces your expenses. Mortgage payments or rent are lower. Continuing expenses like insurance, maintenance, repairs and property taxes are less in a smaller residence. It may reflect your decreased need for space to live in retirement. Perhaps you had children who needed space to play and enough room for all your memories to grow. But as a retiree, your children will likely have homes of their own. You may even be considering downsizing for your health and mobility. After all, falling is a major hazard for those 60 and older; living in a one-story home promises fewer risks than a multi-story property for those in retirement. If your estimated retirement budget exceeds your expected retirement income, you may consider relocating to a more affordable area to reduce expenses. When evaluating budget-friendly retirement spots, consider: Median housing costs Cost of renting vs. buying Median healthcare costs Access to healthcare Crime rate Recreation and amenities Location, weather and climate Compare which states are the most retirement-friendly and fit into your price goals. For example, the cheapest states to buy a home centralize in the mid to southeast region of the U.S. The top four include West Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, and Mississippi. However, looking at the states with the lowest taxes, Florida is a big contender with cities like Tampa, Jacksonville, and Miami, partially thanks to its lack of income tax. Neither list really intersects, which shows the varying benefits a state may have. On one hand you’ll have lower taxes, on the other cheaper housing. There are even five states that have done away with statewide sales tax: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. Alternately, you might look into heading overseas. Malaysia, Panama and Slovenia and consistently rank among the cheapest places to retire, while enabling you to soak up a new culture. But if you’re planning an overseas retirement, be sure to do your research. In addition to considering the cost of living, check any legal requirements for establishing residency in your chosen country. Weigh your options for healthcare and look into potential tax implications associated with claiming Social Security benefits or withdrawing money from investment accounts from afar. Money should never retire. It’s tempting, for example, to keep your funds in a standard checking account. It’s a separate location to store your money. But instead of simply putting away your money, you could dedicate some of it to investment. One of the easiest ways is with a savings account. They’re usually a low-risk, low-yield option, but you can improve your earnings with a high-yield savings account instead. Compared to a savings account that offers an interest rate between 0.01% and 2%, high-yield savings accounts typically have interest rates from 1% to 2.2%. A higher interest rate will also help you keep up with inflation. Look for one with low fees. Alternatively, there are money market accounts, which are a compromise between a checking account and a savings account. They allow you to access and withdraw your money but still earn a higher interest rate. A high-yield money market account may earn nearly 2% in interest. And these are only two savings opportunities you can use to build money passively. Other investment options may work better for your long-term goals, so consider the risk level and yield you want. Avoid unnecessary debt. Pay off the entire balance due each month on credit card debt. Interest rates well above 20% are not uncommon. If you're hit with a big charge consider taking out a personal loan. These usually have lower interest rates and premiums than credit cards. By getting rid of your credit card debt, you will create new financial opportunities. You can put that money towards your retirement savings and help bulk up your funds. Having $5 million at the end of your working years creates a financial cushion. You can live a comfortable life, enjoy yourself along the way, bounce back from the occasional unexpected costs and leave something for your loved ones or favorite charities. The key is to have a financial plan, predicated on a realistic budget. After that consider downsizing or moving - or both. Make sure your funds are working hard for you and keep a lid on unnecessary and excessive debt. Consider talking with a financial advisor who can help you work through retirement planning issues. Finding one doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset’s match-up tool pairs you with up to three local advisors in just a few minutes, making finding the right help the easiest part of your retirement planning.

5/5/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has recruited a longtime Ford Motor Co. executive who helped lead safety efforts and vehicle engineering, a sign the iPhone maker is again ramping up development of an electric car.

Ujkashevic had worked at Ford since 1991, most recently serving as its global director of automotive safety engineering. Before that, she helped oversee engineering of interiors, exteriors, chassis and electrical components for many Ford models. The executive worked on Ford’s Escape, Explorer, Fiesta and Focus models, as well as the Lincoln MKC and Aviator, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also helped develop new electric vehicles for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker. And Ujkashevic has experience dealing with regulatory issues, something that will be key to Apple getting a car on the road. The Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment on the hire. Ford, meanwhile, said that Ujkashevic has retired from the automaker. Enlisting Ujkashevic suggests that Apple is continuing to push toward a self-driving car despite several high-profile departures over the past year. The project’s management team has been almost entirely replaced since it was run by Doug Field, an executive who left for Ford last year. Building an electric, self-driving car is seen as a “next big thing” for Apple -- a new product category that can keep its sales growth from stalling. But the project has suffered numerous strategy shifts and personnel changes since it kicked off around seven years ago. Turnover has been especially heavy over the past year. Besides the departure of Field, Apple lost key managers in charge of hardware engineering, robotics and sensors. In some cases, high-ranking engineers left to join flying taxi startups. After Field quit, the company appointed Apple Watch and health software head Kevin Lynch to oversee the project. Lynch is a well-regarded software engineering manager but hasn’t previously led the development of a vehicle. Still, the company has sought to accelerate the project under Lynch -- with the goal of announcing a product by 2025. An Apple car would put the company in competition with Tesla Inc. and Lucid Group Inc., as well as traditional automakers racing to introduce electric vehicles. Ford has been particularly aggressive in EVs lately with a push to electrify the best-selling vehicle in America: the F-150 pickup. Apple also is trying to master autonomous driving as part of the project -- an auto-industry holy grail that tech companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo also have been grappling with. Over the years, Apple has struggled to settle on a vision for its car, which has been in development since around 2015. The current hope is to make something fully autonomous and remove both the traditional steering wheel and pedals. The company also has sought to emphasize safety with its vehicle. To that end, the company is looking to develop stronger safeguards than what’s available from Tesla and Waymo. That includes building in plenty of redundancy -- layers of backup systems that kick in to avoid safety and driving-system failures -- Bloomberg reported last year. Ujkashevic could be involved with that component. Apple had hired Jaime Waydo to serve as car safety leader in 2018, but the Waymo veteran departed last year. Ujkashevic is now one of the few senior managers on Apple’s car team to come from the auto industry, but there are some others. Last year, Apple hired Ulrich Kranz, a former BMW executive and onetime head of self-driving startup Canoo. Stuart Bowers, a former Tesla executive who worked on self-driving software, and Jonathan Sive, an ex-manager at Tesla, Waymo and BMW, also are involved. At Ford, Ujkashevic was one of the company’s highest-profile managers, serving as a named executive on its website. “Desi has a wealth of global automotive industry leadership experience,” her biography reads on the Ford website. The company credited her with improving products, quality and the customer experience at the 118-year-old company.
