2/16/2022,"José Alvalade, the man who established Sporting Clube de Portugal in the early 1900s, originally intended to study medicine, only to drop out of his Harvard degree because he couldn’t stand the sight of blood. After spending two years as president of the club, he stormed out in a dispute with his fellow directors, tragically dying of Spanish flu at the age of 33. And perhaps the nicest thing you could say about Sporting’s performance against Manchester City on Tuesday night was that it was a more than fitting tribute to his legacy.  Squeamish, rancorous and over far too soon: Sporting’s big night out, their first Champions League knockout game since 2009, imploded in a bouquet of boos and a haze of basic incoherence. City didn’t just put the tie to bed: they embalmed it, sealed it in a lead coffin, wreathed it in chains and dropped it somewhere off the north Atlantic coast. Long before half-time the home crowd was already being treated to chants of “you’ve had your day out, now fuck off home” from the little pocket of enraptured City fans in the bottom corner. They didn’t, of course. They stayed and watched until the grisly end, even rising to salute their demolished team as the minutes ticked away. Who knows, after all, when this stadium will be able to witness a game of this magnitude again? The manager, Rúben Amorim, has done a fine job of resurrecting this fallen giant of Portuguese football and his reward will probably be an elite club job this summer or next. Their dashing midfielder Pedro Gonçalves will get his move sooner or later. This, in a way, is the fate that awaits any club from a smaller league who dares to overachieve: growth, success, acclaim, dismemberment. Just ask Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Rúben Dias or João Cancelo: all once teenage products of the Benfica talent factory, now turning out for the highest bidder. Perhaps that added a little grizzle to the game, given Benfica’s history with their Lisbon rivals. And certainly Silva seemed to take a certain relish in scorching his former foes to the ground: two goals in the first half, another one disallowed, and the rest of the evening spent in a sort of sadistic trance in which the aim was to humiliate as many opponents as possible. But City’s iron fist was wrapped in a velvet glove. The spectacular strikes by Silva and Raheem Sterling will dominate the highlight packages, but perhaps the most impressive element on City’s part was their guile and tactility, the way they played with time as if it were dough in their hands. Witness the little pause and feint of the eyes from Phil Foden to commit the goalkeeper before dinking the ball home for City’s third: all this around four yards from goal. Or the delicate swivel of the ankle from Kevin De Bruyne in the buildup to City’s first goal, diverting the ball to Riyad Mahrez at the very last second. Perhaps, for all the soft-focus coverage of Amorim and his championship-winning Sporting side ahead of the game, we should have seen this trouncing coming. You only had to glance at the two teams lining up before kick-off. While City simply stood stock still, as if this could be any match in any stadium in any city against any opponent, Sporting could scarcely contain their awe. Gonçalves breathed deeply to settle his nerves. Antonio Adán’s eyes darted all around the arena. This was new territory and these were new feelings. Amorim’s greatest quality is the intensity and fervour he manages to draw from this team. But amid a swirling and evangelical noise, it was cool heads that were most sorely lacking here. Mahrez scored City’s first goal after eight minutes, while Sporting’s players were still appealing for offside. The second goal from Silva, a murderous half-volley off the crossbar, was a freak of nature from a freak of nature. The third goal somehow summed up Sporting’s night. Mahrez’s cross was somehow allowed to pass through three sets of legs – Ricardo Esgaio, Matheus Reis, Sebastián Coates – on its way through to Foden, a sort of bizarre penalty-box croquet. City’s fourth goal and Silva’s second was deflected off the backside of Gonçalo Ignácio, which again felt entirely appropriate. Four-nil up by half-time and yet still contractually required to play out the last 135 minutes of this tie, City naturally dialled themselves down a little in the second half. Sterling smashed in a fifth goal and Oleksandr Zinchenko briefly threatened a sixth and João Cancelo played much better after a mixed first half, but all the dramatic tension had long since leaked out of the room. It was the eighth time this season City had scored five goals or more. And curiously, this game told us very little we didn’t already know about them. This is the gift and the curse of the modern City: often we have no idea how they will fare in adversity because they so rarely encounter it. All we can really say with any certainty is that the road to St Petersburg in May will be paved with far sterner challenges than this.",Sport/Football,Ruthless Manchester City toy with Sporting to ruin home side’s big night,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/15/ruthless-manchester-city-toy-with-sporting-to-ruin-home-sides-big-night
2/16/2022,"We are all post-reality and post-truth now. We live as easily online as we do in meatspace. Rumour flies a million times round the world and is established as fact before the truth has even realised there’s a problem, let alone started pulling its boots on. Our elected politicians lie with impunity and thieve from the public purse without consequence. Possess actual knowledge of something and be decried as an elitist and/or establishment stooge. Possess a plausible manner and/or an array of sockpuppet accounts and become a leader of credulous men. And yet, still, the sheer gall and effrontery of the genuine, large-scale grifter, the person who builds a fantasy land for themselves and forces everyone to live in it remains compelling. We have had a slew of recent dramas and documentaries on the subject, and now here’s another tale of a real-life grifter par excellence before which to sit and boggle. Devil’s Advocate: The Mostly True Story of Giovanni Di Stefano (Sky Documentaries) is a three-part examination of the rise and fall of Giovanni di Stefano, AKA John di Stefano, AKA Mr Murder, AKA the eponymous advocate. He was the lawyer, who made his name securing the notorious gangster and fraudster John “Goldfinger” Palmer an appeal against the confiscation of much of his fortune, which ended in Palmer retaining most of the money. He then went on to become famous for, as he put it, “defending the indefensible”. His list of clients read like a Who’s Who of criminality, ranging from Nicholas van Hoogstraten (finding a way to overturn the property tycoon’s manslaughter conviction) all the way up to Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milošević (whom Di Stefano apparently befriended, along with the Serbian paramilitary leader, Željko “Arkan” Ražnatović, when he fled Hollywood for the then war zone in Yugoslavia to escape the consequences of a dubious purchase of MGM), via the likes of Harold Shipman, Ian Brady and various infamous others.  Except, of course, almost none of it was true. And what thin straws of truth there were fashioned into sturdy-looking bricks to build a wall of lies and obfuscation around the charismatic, endlessly quotable, media-friendly lawyer who apparently had no shame and who delighted in being an outsider to and thorn in the side of the traditional legal establishment. A few astute people along the way saw that what many dismissed as the natural arrogance of a successful lawyer was more like the grandiosity of something quite other, but the discovery that not only were half the clients he claimed no such thing but that he was not even a qualified lawyer to begin with still made you reel. The documentary covers a lot of ground: from Di Stefano’s childhood in Petrella Tifernina in southern Italy, the family’s emigration to England when he was six, his convoluted career as a lawyer and fraudster, the painstaking seven-year investigation by the most patient, detail-oriented man in recorded history – Detective Constable Jerry Walters– and the resulting trial and its outcome. It does so in a way that is almost as convoluted as Di Stefano’s career – jumping back and forth in various timelines recounted by Walters and victims as well as the one it is supposedly following itself. Even in an era of non-linear storytelling it is too much. What we gain in an appreciation of the welter of truths, half-truths, outright lies and genuine confusion out of which Walters had to glean his evidence is largely lost in our understanding of the chronology of the case, Di Stefano’s career and quite how he did it. Without such detail, you miss out on some of the awe at the scale of his deceptions – and achievements, however twisted they were – which powers this kind of thing. There is little analysis of what motivated Di Stefano – we get a half-hearted submission of school bullying for being an “Eyetie”, as he – or rather the actor giving voice to his words from previous interviews and footage – put it (Di Stefano did not take part in the programme), and a love of attention. But the accumulating evidence from the recent crop of examinations of the phenomenon suggests that living a “better” life is just what some people do, as naturally as the rest of us breath and pay our bills. Walters, the still, quiet, conscientious centre of the storm is, arguably, more interesting. The detective constable spent five years turning up clues, following leads, gathering the testimonies of smaller, sadder victims of Di Stefano’s less glamorous scams, and marshalling them into a case to stop Di Stefano wreaking havoc and laying waste to ordinary lives without a backward glance. I could take a three-part documentary about good people right now, you know. I really could.",Arts/Television & radio,Devil’s Advocate review – a mind-boggling tale of a real-life grifter,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/15/devils-advocate-review-another-mind-boggling-tale-of-a-real-life-grifter-giovanni-di-stefano
2/16/2022,"New Zealand has banned conversion practices, with near unanimity, after all but eight National party members voted in favour of the law. Conversion “therapy” refers to the practice, often by religious groups, of trying to “cure” people of their sexuality, gender expression or LGBTQI identity.  The legislation, which was passed on Tuesday evening, makes it an offence to perform conversion practices on anyone aged under 18, or with impaired decision-making capacity, with a sentence of up to three years’ imprisonment. It also makes it an offence to perform conversion practices that cause “serious harm”, irrespective of age. That carries a sentence of up to five years’ imprisonment. The justice select committee received nearly 107,000 public submissions on the law – the highest number of public submissions received on a piece of legislation in New Zealand. Speaking to the house, the deputy prime minister, Grant Robertson, said the law would right some of the wrongs caused by conversion practices. “I grew up in a religious churchgoing household in the era of homosexual law reform,” he said. “When I finally gathered the courage to come out to my parents, I was met with love … but not everyone is or was so lucky. “To all those who have been affected by conversion practices or attempts at them, we want to say, this legislation is for you. We cannot bring you back, we cannot undo all of the hurt, but we can make sure that for the generations to come, we provide the support and love you did not get and protect you from the harm of those who seek to try to stop you from being who you are.” Posting to Facebook, the minister Kiri Allan shared her own experience of conversion practices as a 16-year-old. “I went through conversion therapy (it wasn’t called that, but that’s what it was) through my church. I desperately tried to ‘pray the gay’ away – to be accepted by my family, community and church. “My ‘illness’ & ‘weakness’ to temptation was etched as sin into my skin. It took a long time to shake that shame and trauma. Tonight our Parliament will ensure this practice is banned in our country for good. For our next generation of babies, I am so incredibly relieved. Thank you to everyone that championed this change.” The founder of the Conversion Therapy Action Group, Shaneel Lal, said: “The ban on conversion therapy is a win for humanity, not just the queer community. Queer rights are human rights. Queer people do not need to be tolerated or accepted, we need to be liberated.” The UN independent expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity found conversion practices caused “significant loss of self-esteem, anxiety, depressive syndrome, social isolation, intimacy difficulty, self-hatred, shame and guilt, sexual dysfunction, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder”. New Zealand has the highest youth suicide rate in the OECD, and that rate is higher among LGBTQI+ youth. Research from 2019 found 79% of trans and non-binary New Zealanders had seriously contemplated suicide and two-fifths had self-harmed in the past 12 months.",News/World news,New Zealand bans conversion practices in vote hailed as ‘win for humanity’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/new-zealand-bans-conversion-practices-in-vote-hailed-as-win-for-humanity
2/16/2022,"Escape from the City may seem like a benign lifestyle show, but no other program is more frustrating in its ability to create tension while failing to provide release. There’s rarely an episode where I haven’t felt compelled to throw something at the screen by the end. But yet – I keep coming back for more. There are 60 episodes of this ABC property program (some are available on iView), all shot and produced between 2017 and 2020 in a variety of regional towns across Australia. Each episode follows an urban family or individual wanting to make a sea or tree change to “escape from the city”. The episodes follow a strict formula (borrowed from the UK’s Escape to the Country), where one of the show’s five presenters introduces the guests to four houses (including one mystery house, designed to surprise). The suspense builds for an hour – until the end of the episode when the buyer then decides which house they want.  It’s all very watchable (particularly when your own area is featured). The only problem is that barely any of the buyers actually buy the houses on offer, thus robbing the viewer of the sense of a satisfying ending. It’s like watching a whole season of the Bachelorette, where the star meets a bunch of interesting and attractive candidates, and of course you, as a viewer, have your favourites, and you are watching closely to see how the Bachelorette reacts to each of them – then suddenly the show ends with a flash of text that reads, “The Bachelorette has decided to return to Melbourne and be single for a while longer until she meets someone more suitable.” Come to think of it, that’s what happened in the sixth season of the Bachelor, where Nick Cummins aka Honey Badger left without picking anyone, and there was a national uproar. That’s what it was like every week watching Escape from the City. And I don’t understand it. Each week, at least two of the four houses are usually great. The buyers have ample time to inspect the properties and get private tours with an attentive host. I think of my own house. It was only the second home I had inspected, in a town I had been in for 15 minutes of my entire life, and I had to be quick about putting an offer in because someone else was interested. (So they said.) I’ve spent more time deciding what shoes to buy. My childhood home was purchased in a similar fashion: my dad and I did a quick walkthrough on auction day with heaps of other people, he started bidding and looked extremely shocked when he succeeded. Or the countless buyers who didn’t even see the houses they were purchasing during the pandemic. They do a virtual tour and like the rest of us, hope for the best. And then you see these absolute luvvies on EFTC who have all the time in the world, four houses to choose from, and private tours, who still umm and ah and say they need more time. As we now know, time is money when it comes to Australia’s hot property market; the failure to jump on something immediately means that next week or next month, that house suddenly becomes unaffordable or unavailable. The hosts’ seeming inability to close the deal means that none of them – Jane Hall, Simon Marnie, Bryce Holdaway, Del Irani and Dean Ipaviz – would last a month in a commercial real estate agency. But it’s not their fault, and they come across as personable, warm and hardworking, and they genuinely seem to care about the buyers. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning My frustration with the guests is even more acute now, rewatching episodes on iView, knowing that property prices in the regions have gone so crazy since it first aired. The couple who moved back to Brunswick and were going to drag out their search missed out on a stunning house in Terrigal with its own rainforest. The freshly-renovated three-bedroom house was priced at $780,000 and only minutes from Terrigal beach. That was less than four years ago – it would be worth $1m-plus now. Ditto a couple who passed on a gorgeous, $1.6m place in central Berry, which had an incredible garden, a pool, and four bedrooms – that would now be worth at least $3m. Both of these couples ended their episodes not buying any of the properties, all of which would have doubled in value during the pandemic. Perhaps the frustration with Escape from the City is not so much the lack of a satisfying ending, but watching the 2018 property market with 2022 eyes. If only we could go back in time.

2/16/2022,"A patient in the UK who died last week from Lassa fever, an acute viral infection endemic in parts of Africa, was a newborn baby, according to reports. The child, who died at the Luton and Dunstable hospital last week, was one of three confirmed cases of the disease all within the same family, the BBC reported.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Friday that an individual with the disease, which is similar to Ebola, had died in Bedfordshire and two other people had been infected. All three cases were linked to recent travel in west Africa. NHS East of England declared a “regional major incident” last week after news emerged of the infections, the first cases of the disease in the UK since 2009. Staff at Luton and Dunstable hospital and at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge have reportedly been identified as potential contacts. NHS England and the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) have not commented on the death but confirmed contact tracing was under way. In an email to staff seen by the BBC, Cambridge University hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Addenbrooke’s, said: “Colleagues identified through our staff contact tracing exercise have been required to undertake a precautionary isolation period of 14 days, and not have patient contact for 21 days. “As expected, this is impacting on our staffing levels and has required the temporary closure of a substantial portion of our critical care capacity – with impact on our clinical services. “We want to assure you all that cases of Lassa fever are rare in the UK and it does not spread easily between people. The overall risk to healthcare staff and other patients is very low.” The UKHSA has assured the public that the risk of further infections in the UK remains “very low”. Prior to the three recent infections, eight cases had been identified in the UK since 1980.

2/16/2022,"Elon Musk’s brain chip company Neuralink is defending itself against claims that its researchers abused monkeys in the testing of its products. Neuralink – which hopes to create a revolutionary interface that would allow humans to control devices with their brains – said in a statement on Monday that its research animals were “respected and honored by our team”. The company was responding to allegations that the animals were tortured and left to die in horrific experiments at its facilities.  In a lengthy complaint filed with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) said the research caused “extreme suffering” in its test subjects, who “had their brains mutilated in shoddy experiments and were left to suffer and die”. PCRM is a non-profit advocacy organization that promotes a plant-based diet and alternatives to animal testing. The complaint targets a partnership between Neuralink and the University of California, Davis that was carried out between 2017 and 2020, in which researchers implanted a device “approximately the size of a quarter” into the skull of macaque monkey test subjects. PCRM obtained hundreds of pages of health records, necropsy reports and other documents related to the $1.4m partnership through California’s open records laws. It said the documents reveal the monkeys suffered “extreme psychological distress” from the “crude surgeries”. In the complaint, PCRM said Neuralink used a substance known as “BioGlue” that destroyed parts of the monkeys’ brains. It described animals exhibiting substantial psychological effects from the experiments, including anxiety, vomiting, poor appetite, hair loss and self-mutilating behavior including removing their own fingers. Neuralink called the data cited in the complaint “misleading”, saying in a blogpost it “did and continues to meet federally mandated standards”. After the UC Davis partnership came to an end, Neuralink moved its work to an in-house facility. It responded directly to allegations that more than a dozen monkeys died after Neuralink procedures, stating that some of these were “terminal procedures” – where live test subjects are euthanized “humanely” following surgery. Musk has previously stated that Neuralink’s brain chip technology could have major implications for people with disabilities, tweeting it would “let a paralyzed person tweet faster than a person using their thumbs on a smartphone”, for example. Neuralink in 2021 published a video of a monkey appearing to control a computer with its mind. The release sparked controversy, with many noting that typically such videos are published in scientific journals and subject to peer review, allowing for more oversight and accountability. PCRM said in its complaint that Neuralink has violated Animal Welfare Act regulations and has requested both UC Davis and Neuralink be given the “maximum civil penalty available per violation”. The USDA did not immediately respond to request for comment.",News/World news,"Elon Musk’s brain chip company, Neuralink, faces animal abuse claims",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/elon-musk-neuralink-animal-cruelty-allegations
