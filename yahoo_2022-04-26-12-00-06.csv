4/26/2022,"Watch: U.S. visits Kyiv and steps up military aid for Ukraine By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Russia told the United States to stop sending more arms to Ukraine, warning that large Western deliveries of weapons were inflaming the conflict and would lead to more losses, Moscow's ambassador to Washington said. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers. The United States has ruled out sending its own or NATO forces to Ukraine but Washington and its European allies have supplied weapons to Kyiv such as drones, Howitzer heavy artillery, anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles. Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the United States, said such arms deliveries were aimed at weakening Russia but that they were escalating the conflict in Ukraine while undermining efforts to reach some sort of peace agreement. ""What the Americans are doing is pouring oil on the flames,"" Antonov told the Rossiya 24 TV channel. ""I see only an attempt to raise the stakes, to aggravate the situation, to see more losses."" Antonov, who has served as ambassador to Washington since 2017, said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia's concerns. No reply had been given, Antonov said. Watch: Russia renews attack on Mariupol, Ukraine says ""We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,"" Antonov said. The interview was replayed on Russian state television throughout Monday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Kyiv on Sunday. They told Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy of more than $322 million in new military financing for Ukraine, taking total U.S. security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, a U.S. official said. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged $800 million in more weaponry for Ukraine on Thursday and said he would ask Congress for more money to help bolster support for the Ukrainian military. President Vladimir Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people. Putin, who says Ukraine and Russia are essentially one people, casts the war as an inevitable confrontation with the United States, which he accuses of threatening Russia by meddling in its backyard and enlarging the NATO military alliance. Ukraine says it is fighting an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. Zelenskiy has been pleading with U.S. and European leaders to supply Kyiv with heavier arms and equipment. Putin warned in February that there would be no winners in a conflict between NATO and Russia, which has the world's biggest arsenal of nuclear warheads.

4/26/2022,"More and more European militaries are buying the F-35 to update their air forces. The arrival of the F-35 means pilots in those air forces have to learn to fly a more advanced jet. That isn't an easy change for pilots used to Soviet-made jets, says former F-35 test pilot Billie Flynn. The F-35 is fast becoming the fighter jet of choice for many European air forces due to its technological and operational advantages over other available airframes. Eight European countries either operate the fifth-generation fighter jet or have placed orders for it. More countries are in discussions to acquire the jet in the near future. The increasing number of F-35s in Europe means more pilots will have to learn to fly the jet, but the F-35's technological superiority means some pilots, especially those trained to operate Soviet-made aircraft, likely won't be able to make the change. Among NATO's 30 members, only Bulgaria, Poland, and Slovakia still operate Soviet-era aircraft. Of those three, Poland has the most, with 23 operational MiG-29s and 12 operational but obsolescent Su-22s. The rest of Poland's combat fleet is made up of 36 US-made F-16s. In 2020, in an effort to modernize its air force, Warsaw ordered 32 F-35As, and it has an option to buy 16 more. The mix of Western-made and Soviet-origin aircraft reflects Poland's political history as a member of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War and now as a member of NATO and the EU. Yet that mix will also make it harder for Poland to integrate the F-35 into its fleet, according to Billie Flynn, a former Canadian air force lieutenant colonel and senior F-35 test pilot. In an interview with the Aviationist, Flynn explained how Polish pilots will struggled to move between those different aircraft. ""There's very much the Russian, Eastern Bloc mentality [vs.] the Western F-16 cadre"" in the Polish Air Force, and the pilots in each cadre do not cross between them, Flynn said. Flynn said any pilot would face a ""leap"" in transitioning to the F-35, one of only four fifth-generation jets in operation around the world. F-16 pilots, or the Western cadre, in the Polish Air Force would be able to transition to the newer jet, as many pilots in other air forces with the F-35 have done, but the Polish Air Force's ""Eastern Bloc"" of pilots won't be as fortunate, Flynn added. Asking even a very capable MiG-29 pilot ""to transition to this cosmic spaceship is far too much to grasp,"" Flynn said, referring to the F-35. The F-16 and the MiG-29 are comparable in terms of capabilities. Although the MiG-29 is primarily an air-superiority fighter and the F-16 a multi-role aircraft, both are fourth-generation fighters. The Soviet jet was in fact built as a response to the American F-16 and F-15. But transitioning from that Soviet-made jet to modern US fighters requires more than learning new capabilities. It also requires adjusting to a totally different design philosophy, which makes such a transition practically impossible, according to Flynn. ""Every part of how we mechanize the aircraft in the West is different from how Russians design their aircraft, every part of philosophy of how you fly an airplane, how you design cockpits, how you process information is different,"" Flynn told the Aviationist. In contrast, it's easier for an F-16 pilot to switch to the F-35 — both of which are designed and built by Lockheed Martin — as the stealth fighter is a ""logical step forward,"" Flynn said. ""To say to an F-16 pilot, hey, we're Lockheed Martin, and we build the aircraft [a] certain way, and switches [a] certain way, and now we're going to give you the next generation of that, there's a logic flow of our design, of the F-16, as the baseline, that kind of looks like what the F-35 is,"" Flynn said. ""That does not exist for the MiG cadre."" The inability of MiG-29 pilots to make the jump to the new era is a sign of their aircraft's approaching obsolescence. Poland, Bulgaria, and Slovakia already struggle to keep their MiG-29s up to date. Poland has maintained its MiG-29 contingent on par with its F-16, but as time and worsening relations with Russia make replacement airframes and machine parts harder to find, the last three NATO MiG-29 operators are slowly phasing out the aircraft. ""I think the [Polish] MiG cadre will end up atrophying, spending their time in that jet until the MiG-29 phases out,"" Flynn said. With militaries embracing of the F-35 and other advanced jets, ""there is no place for the MiG-29 pilots in the sophisticated world of"" fifth-generation aircraft, he added.

4/26/2022,"The law enforcement community gathered Sunday to remember a state trooper who tragically lost his life in the line of duty. In January, Trooper John Horton was responding to a traffic stop in Rutherford County. When his brother and fellow trooper James Horton arrived at the scene, James lost control of his patrol car. The collision resulted in the death of John, as well as the driver John had detained. The Hortons said they have worked with the Highway Patrol station in Forest Hill for more than 10 years. The community has steadfastly stood behind the family during the tragedy and offered them a generous gift.

And we just really love all of them,” Ashley Horton, John’s widow, said. Ashley Horton said she and John Horton met in high school and had six children together before he passed away. “We talk a lot about their dad every day.

And we’re just really thankful that we have each other,” Ashley Horton said. Channel 9′s Glenn Counts said he had the chance to speak with John’s brother James, who the family refers to as Nick. He told Counts that he was taking one day at a time and wouldn’t wish what he was going through on anyone. “I’m just taking it day by day. Hour by hour. Minute by minute. Some days are OK. Some days are not so good. But we’re gonna get through it,” James Horton said. Horton said it helps to know that one day he will be reunited with his brother again. “Knowing where John is, knowing that I’ll get to see him again one day ... that’s the only peace and comfort that I can find in it,” said James. James Horton said when he is able to he will come back to the highway patrol, possibly in a different capacity, even if it’s working on trucking issues.

4/26/2022,"There has been a lot of talk this week about the new trove of text messages to and from former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, but there was one in particular that stood out to Seth Meyers. Two days after her father lost the 2020 election, Ivanka Trump texted a group of his closest advisers, “You are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight!” “She’s trying to overturn the results of an election with the tone of a Peloton instruction,” the Late Night host joked Monday night. “And also, just a tip, if you’re planning a coup, maybe don’t do it via group chat?” He proceeded to imagine her next text: “Should do the coup on TikTok? I think that would totally slay!! LMK!” From there, Meyers moved on to go after Republican lawmakers like Kevin McCarthy, Lindsey Graham and others who “keep getting caught on tape lying or contracting themselves” about Trump and aspiring GOP senators like David Perdue and J.D.

4/26/2022,"By Daniel Trotta (Reuters) -A proposed California desalination plant that would produce 50 million gallons of drinking water per day failed a crucial regulatory hurdle on Monday, possibly dooming a project that had been promoted as a partial solution for sustained drought. The staff of the California Coastal Commission recommended denying approval of the Huntington Beach plant proposed by Poseidon Water, controlled by the infrastructure arm of Canada's Brookfield Asset Management. The commission's staff said the project was more susceptible to sea-level rise than was understood when it was first proposed more than two decades ago. The plant is expected to produce 50 million gallons (189.3 million liters) of drinking water per day, enough for 16% of the homes in the Orange County Water District, where 2.5 million people live. The commission staff also deemed the project harmful to nearby fish and bird habitat, said the ground beneath the plant posed a seismic risk, and that the higher cost of the plant's water would squeeze low-income consumers. ""When Poseidon first proposed its facility at this location nearly 25 years ago, sea level rise projections were much lower and adaptation planning was in its infancy,"" the staff report said. ""Since that time, our understanding of the severity and consequences of climate change and sea level rise have grown exponentially."" It also raised the risks of sea-rise elsewhere in California. The proposed desalination plant would be on low-lying land about 30 miles (50 km) south of Los Angeles. ""By 2050 to 2070, the surrounding area may be flooded regularly,"" the report said. Environmentalists have long campaigned against the plant, saying desalination decimates ocean life, costs too much money and energy and soon would be made obsolete by water recycling. The Coastal Commission, which is scheduled to consider the matter on May 12, could defy the staff recommendation and vote to approve the project, but it rarely does so. The 12-member commission is made up of six local elected officials and six members of the public who are appointed by the governor, a senate committee, and the assembly speaker. Poseidon has operated a similar plant, the largest in the United States, down the coast in Carlsbad since 2015, but that was approved locally before the state adopted regulations for desalination plants. The company, which was hoping to break ground on the $1.4 billion Huntington Beach plant by the end of this year, said the commission staff ""erred in its recommendation"" and called on political leaders to save the project. ""California's elected officials and regulators should consider the dire consequences that this recommendation will have for desalination in California,"" Poseidon said in a statement. ""If this recommendation stands, it will be the death knell for desalination in California,"" it said. But some environmentalists, while praising the conclusions of the report, were not celebrating yet. ""This is not a win. We still need to go through the (May 12) hearing,"" said Andrea Leon-Grossmann, director of climate action for the ocean conservation group Azul. California Governor Gavin Newsom had offered conditional support for the project, so long as it could be done responsibly. Responding to the recommendation, Alex Stack, a spokesman for the governor, said California faced an unprecedented drought and that the first three months of this year were the driest in recorded history. ""This Administration is committed to ensuring the sustainability of California's water supply with an all-of-the above strategy, and that includes desalination,"" Stack said in a statement. ""Regions across California must continue to innovate on local projects as climate change makes our state's water supply more unpredictable.""
