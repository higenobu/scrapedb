3/1/2022,"STORY: Clinging to rooftops, waiting for help, Australians across the east coast have faced its worst floods on record. In the Northern city of Lismore in New South Wales locals have watched their streets become totally engulfed by floodwater. And it’s coming for Sydney. Authorities have warned the city to brace for heavy rain and possible flash flooding over the next two days. The Bureau of Meteorology predicted the city and several neighbouring regions could get up to 6 inches within a six-hour period on Tuesday. That’s more than the total of what the city usually experiences in the month of March. At least 10 people have been killed in Australia since the rain battered the state of New South Wales as well Queensland last week, with floods submerging towns and roads. New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet warned residents in the state's south to get ready to leave their homes immediately if they are asked. ""We've seen people stranded on roofs for hours, we've seen children being rescued, we're seeing people stranded on bridges. But importantly as well, we're also seeing a community come together."" Australia's east coast summer has been dominated by the La Nina climate pattern, which is typically associated with greater rainfall, for a second straight year.",Science/Reuters Videos,Sydney braces for 'one-in-a-one thousand' year floods,https://news.yahoo.com/sydney-braces-one-one-thousand-084723914.html
3/1/2022,"The U.S. and Europe effectively cut off Russia's economy Monday as a way to push Russian President Vladimir into abandoning his increasingly bloody invasion of Ukraine. Even Switzerland, a favorite home for the money of ultra-wealth Russians, said Monday it will comply with the EU sanctions and asset freezes of certain oligarchs close to Putin. The measures are hitting everyone in Russia, but they are aimed at Putin's inner circle. The White House on Saturday announced a new transatlantic task force ""to identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs — their yachts, their mansions, and any other ill-gotten gains."" Russian oligarchs own some of the world's most expensive yachts and private jets, and they apparently want to keep them. ""Some of Russia's wealthiest are moving their boats to other locations, potentially with the hope they can avoid having those items seized,"" CNBC reported Monday. One Ukrainian mechanic on a Russian super-yacht docked in Mallorca, Spain, took matters into his own hands on Saturday, Spain's Ultima Hora reported. The mechanic, Taras Ostapchuk, saw a video of Russian missiles striking an apartment complex in Kyiv and decided to sink the $7 million yacht, the Lady Anastasia, he said is owned by a Russian arms tycoon, his boss. ""I told myself: 'What do I need a job for if I don't have a country?'"" he told Ultima Hora. He opened two valves in the yacht to let in water, then told fellow crew members so they wouldn't drown, Ostapchuk told a judge after police arrested him, The Washington Post reports. ""I don't regret anything I've done, and I would do it again,"" Ostapchuk, 55, told the court, according to Ultima Hora. His lawyer, Neus Canyelles Nicolau, confirmed the details to the Post on Monday and said that her client had been released. Ostapchuk told reporters he is heading back to Kyiv to fight the Russian invaders. Meanwhile, faint cracks are appearing between Putin and ""members of the oligarch class who made billions of dollars while showing fealty to the autocratic leader but now see their fortunes threatened by Western sanctions,"" the Post reports. ""Sanctions experts and former U.S. officials said that while the signs of dissent remain tepid, they represent a more palpable fraying of relations between Putin and the ranks of elite loyalists than has been observed in years.""

3/1/2022,"Germany's fresh push to spend more on its military in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine could provide a major financial tailwind to five European defense companies, explains Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie. ""Companies with the largest exposure to Germany's defense spending do not fall under our coverage, but we flag Hensoldt with 52% of 2020 sales from German defense (and indirectly Leonardo, which holds 25% of Hensoldt) and Rheinmetall (c.33% of 2020 sales). BAE Systems and Thales have a lower exposure, which we estimate at 1-4% of sales for both. However, they should still both benefit from higher spend across the board, and from support of their own countries sent to Ukraine,"" Lemarie said in a new note on Monday. On Sunday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz revealed the country would be raising its defense and military spending above 2% of its total GDP. The spending would kick off with a roughly $113 billion investment to boost the languishing German military. The news sent shares of well-known defense stocks surging on Monday. Lockheed Martin popped 5%, while Raytheon gained 3%. The aforementioned BAE Systems skyrocketed 10%. Jefferies LeMarie speculated non-U.S. NATO members must increase defense budgets by 25% to reach Germany's targeted 2% of GDP level. If they do ramp up defense spending to that extent, it could be a tailwind to many defense companies beyond those based in Europe. ""With the open war situation in Ukraine, and NATO forces being deployed to neighboring countries, defense consumables (ammunition, countermeasures etc.) should be the first products to experience restocking and order uplift,"" LeMarie added. ""This should translate into even greater top line-growth potential for the defense industry over the coming years."" Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
