3/3/2022,"When Billy Curry arrived by boat at McKenzie Street, Lismore on Monday, he saw what he described as “a bad dream”. What was once a suburban street had turned into a river, its current rapid and the waters brown and deep. While emergency crews in hi-vis gear crewed boats, waves lapped at treetops and powerlines. And at the RSL LifeCare at Home, the local aged care facility down the road, windows were slowly disappearing beneath rising waters. “There was water up to the second or third floor,” Curry says. “You couldn’t tell, the water was that high. “It was a total lagoon.” Curry, a 46-year-old marketing manager, is not from Lismore. He lives a 40-minute drive away, in Lennox Head. He saw countless posts by Lismore locals calling for help on the SES Facebook page and decided to hitchhike into town and help. “I have a lifesaving background of 20 years,” he says. “Lifesavers naturally take action.” He arrived in Lismore at 10.45am, and found a friend from Lennox Head, also keen to help out. While talking with SES members and other volunteers the pair learned of the retirement home on McKenzie Street and they joined that rescue team.

Many of the residents were anxious and confused and some could not walk, Curry said. So the task of carrying each person out the window, and handing then down to a boat, was “very difficult”. They tried a makeshift staircase to get people to the window – made up of a microwave, a small table and a larger table. When that didn’t work they began using sheets to lift each person on to the veranda roof. “There was a risk of falling through the roof,” Curry says. “And if you fall through the roof, and you have an old person, it is going to be difficult to stop them drowning.” But, with the sun going down, “it was our only route”. The rescue crew was made up of SES volunteers, army personnel, one female police officer “who started work Sunday evening and hadn’t slept”, a boat driver, aged care staff and other volunteers. “You can’t understand how severe it is,” Curry says. “It’s hard to quantify the depth of this disaster.” As flood waters recede after days of destruction across Queensland and New South Wales, the extraordinary efforts on the ground by locals like Curry, local businesses and emergency rescue teams are being told. These remarkable stories of survival include the rescue of an elderly woman inside her flooded Lismore home by two senior constables from Oxley police district.

They heard “a faint call for help from inside a home with water up to the eaves of the house”, the statement reads. One of the officers “dove through an open window” and found a 93-year-old woman “floating on a mattress, with no more than 20cm of room between the roof and the water level”. The woman was pulled back through the open window on a boogie board, and on to a rescue boat. Louis Hollman, of Louis Hollman Electrical, has spent the past several days on similar rescue missions; in a boat with two colleagues, checking homes for people left stranded. “I was seeing houses submerged in water, families losing everything,” Hollman told Guardian Australia. “Now the water is going down,” Hollman says he and other local contractors are “going around to see what’s left”. He says most switchboards and electric meter boxes need to be replaced. “Getting at least some power back is essential.” His wholesalers in Lismore went under, “so we don’t even have any gear”. But having “no power makes it even more unsafe”. “You can’t cook fresh food, or keep water cool,” he says. “At night-time, even having just one light makes you feel less lonely.” In Casino, a 40-minute drive from Lismore, T&W McCormack Real Estate has been lending its services to help on the ground, too. In response to countless livestock that has been “floating away,” Matthew McCormack and his team are locating, mustering and transporting lost cattle. “There are cattle everywhere on the outskirts of town, unaccounted for and not retrieved yet,” McCormack told Guardian Australia. He says cattle are coming from local farms, after being “washed away off the edge of the banks” from areas like Coraki, Woodburn and Broadwater. “We get a lead off one, then it goes from there. We pick them up out of town, and have a steady yard system on the edge of town where we bring the cattle back to.” McCormack says “the cattle are pretty stressed”. “So we get them on some feed, water, and let them settle down.” There are at least “a couple hundred” lost cattle that McCormack is aware of. And the helping hands are coming from beyond the state too. A team of nine from Sikh Volunteers Australia drove from Victoria to NSW overnight to provide fresh meals and water to the Lismore community hit by floods. They left Melbourne at 6am on Tuesday and arrived in Woolgoolga at 4am on Wednesday. There they prepared food in the Guru Nanak Sikh Temple, then drove to Lismore, where they have been serving the affected communities. “We have received lots of calls from Lismore,” a spokesperson told Guardian Australia. “They are especially asking for water.” “We know we can’t do everything, but we can help a little bit.”",News/Australia news,‘A faint call for help’: remarkable stories emerge from NSW flood rescues,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/a-faint-call-for-help-remarkable-stories-emerge-from-nsw-flood-rescues
3/3/2022,"The international criminal court (ICC) has confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The ICC process was sped up after 38 countries formally referred reports of atrocities to it, the largest referral the court has ever received. Russia has claimed to have captured the strategically important southern city of Kherson on the Black Sea. US intelligence and Ukrainian officials have disputed the claim. In a Facebook post, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said “there were armed visitors in the city council”. and Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said:“We’re not in a position to call it either way. It appears to us that the Ukrainians are certainly fighting over that town.” The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said. The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has come under more heavy shelling as Russian forces step up their offensive and move forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. On Wednesday, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day eight,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/russia-ukraine-war-russian-invasion-news-what-we-know-so-far-on-day-seven
3/3/2022,"“We will not be defined by this,” prime minister Jacinda Ardern said, as New Zealand’s parliament grounds descended into chaos, fire and violence in a shocking end to the anti-mandate protests that have occupied the capital city’s centre. An undercurrent of violence had simmered throughout the weeks-long Ottawa-inspired occupation, which was blighted by abusive behaviour, conspiracy theories, and death threats. On Wednesday, riot police moved in with pepper spray and rubber bullets, and the powder keg exploded. Protesters set their tents alight, and lit a bonfire beneath the parliamentary children’s playground. People could be heard whooping and yelling, “burn it down, burn it down.” As fires burned across the lawns, some protesters worked to spread them and set more tents alight, while a woman screamed “What are you doing? People will get hurt”. Gas bottles exploded as they were consumed by the blaze. At a bonfire next to the cenotaph war memorial, protesters threw tents, trash and wooden pallets on the flames. Others hurled anything within reach at lines of riot police: chairs, fireworks, rubbish bins, and paving stones ripped from the parliamentary paths. By evening, firefighter hoses had dampened the flames and revealed a graveyard of burnt tents, blackened grass, and tipped-over portaloos. A small group of 150 protesters who were funnelled down a sidestreet continued to clash with police. As the smoke cleared, New Zealand was left reckoning with scenes without precedent in recent decades. Violence is a rarity at the country’s parliament, which has a tradition of openness, relatively light security and high levels of public access. The protests marked a confronting shift in tone from the first two years of New Zealand’s pandemic, which were characterised by unusually high levels of consensus and support for government public health measures, as well as rising levels of trust in science and experts. Many protesters blamed the violence on police plants, outside agitators or “antifa” infiltrators. Christopher Best, a protester standing back from where the scuffles were breaking out, appeared shell-shocked. “What you’re seeing here is not the protesters that actually want to protest for the mandates, these are the extremists,” he said. Best had been at the encampment for 23 days and said the tone of the protest had shifted dramatically in the last 48 hours, but he struggled to articulate who the newcomers were. “We’ve seen another a group of people who just want to create trouble. These people are coming in and wrecking it.” “They’re so new … we’ve been here a long time, and we don’t know them,” said Fern Cameron, who had been at the protest for eight days. Now, the cleanup bill for parliament’s grounds, gardens and the surrounding streets could mount into the millions. But leaders are also reckoning with how to confront the social mess that parliament’s occupation – and its violent end – represented. “One day, it will be our job to try and understand how group of people could succumb to such wild and dangerous mis- and disinformation – and while many of us … dismissed it as conspiracy theory, a small portion of our society have not only believed it, they have acted upon it in an extreme and violent way,” Ardern said. Dr Sanjana Hattotuwa, a misinformation and extremism specialist at research centre Te Pūnaha Matatini, said all of the ingredients had been present for the protest to descend into violence. “With the conditions that one sees online … it doesn’t require genius to say it leads to greater volatility, and the greater possibility of something like what happened today occurring,” he said. “Aotearoa New Zealand is not exceptional [in seeing this], but for the country, I think this is a moment,” he said. “We’ll be talking about this for a very long time to come, about what it means.” Te Pūnaha Matatini researchers had been monitoring a massive increase in production and engagement with extremist language and disinformation on New Zealand social media sites, he said. “We have for months been observing the magma building up and building up and building up – and then the pressure and the final eruption.” While the convoy and occupation had begun as a demonstration against mandates requiring many frontline workers to be vaccinated, they quickly expanded to play host to a range of far broader and more extreme views. Theories proliferated that would once have seemed like foreign oddities to many New Zealanders: stories of Q-Anon’s prophesies, of a genocide plot planned by Bill Gates, of an impending “Nuremberg 2.0” trial that would see the prime minister and numerous others put to death for crimes against humanity. The explosion of violence on parliament grounds will no doubt draw comparisons to Washington’s storming of the capitol in 2021. “There has, all the way through, been an element to this occupation that has not felt like New Zealand.” Ardern said on Wednesday. “It has this almost imported feel to it.” But Wellington’s occupation also had some elements that were distinctly homegrown. The country is dealing with rapidly rising inequality, a housing affordability crisis, and deeply embedded ethnic inequalities – elements that researchers said could contribute to the resentment and anger among some on parliament grounds. “What has struck me … is less a sense that violence and fascism is widespread [at the protests], although it is certainly there – but more that conspiracy theory thinking is rife,” inequality researcher Max Rashbrooke said. “I do think that’s worrying – and that yes, some of them will have become vulnerable to that because they feel disenfranchised.” A large portion of protesters were Māori, and some said New Zealand’s history of violent colonisation and disfranchisement had contributed to their distrust of the crown, and desire to see mandates abolished. Earlier in the week, Ema Weepu, a rongoa [traditional Māori medicine] practitioner, told the Guardian there were many different agendas present, but the central focus on mandates was shared. Visiting the week before the violence began, Weepu said at the time that colonisation contributed to some protesters’ anger and distrust of the government. “We have been oppressed,” she said. “They take our land, they take our children, they take our language, they take all of these things. So we end up with battered, bruised generations – and those are some of the angry people that are here.” “We have a challenge in front of us, but so do many democracies,” Ardern said. She said there were no simple or short-term solutions on the table. “It’s not about taking away people’s ability to have differing opinions, to have debates, to take different positions and stands. People should, of course, always have that freedom of thought and view and perspective – and in New Zealand we’ve celebrated that. But when the debate you’re having is no longer based on fact, where does that take you? That’s the challenge we have.” On the parliament forecourt, abandoned signs lay in piles or leaned against fences: “Jabcinda, crimes against humanity: guilty,” said one. “Peaceful protesters, not predators’ prey,” another read. A third asked: “What next?”",News/World news,‘This is a moment’: New Zealand reckons with aftermath as smoke clears on violent protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/this-is-a-moment-new-zealand-reckons-with-aftermath-as-smoke-clears-on-violent-protests
3/3/2022,"The NRL’s Canterbury and South Sydney have joined a cohort of sports clubs pledging to refuse money from betting agencies, in a move to distance themselves from the gambling industry. Rugby league is the fifth code to sign up to the New South Wales government’s Reclaim the Game program, which aims to help fans experience sport without the influence of betting advertising and sponsorship. Already nine clubs across the AFL, basketball, cricket and football to have committed to “challenge the idea that betting is a normal part of sport”, with the Sydney Swans, the Sydney Kings, the Sydney Sixers and Thunder and the Western Sydney Wanderers and Macarthur FC among the signatories. Now the Bulldogs and Rabbitohs have announced they too will prohibit betting promotions on ground signage and big screens and removing sponsorship from all club apparel. Education is another key element of the initiative, with players to add their voice to address the normalisation of gambling in Australia – according to the NSW government, more than half of adults in the state gamble each year. Overall the Australian gambling market was in 2019 estimated to be worth more than $225bn, while online gambling rose sharply during the pandemic. “Our community plays such a big role in our club, and we felt that this is a campaign we can support to reduce community exposure to sports betting advertising,” said Rabbitohs chief executive Blake Solly. “Research shows there are long-term effects on families when sports betting causes gambling harm in the community and we feel the Reclaim the Game message is a positive for the fans and families that support our club and our sport.” Bulldogs chief executive, Aaron Warburton, said supporters should be able to attend a match “without the constant advertising from sports betting companies”. Both clubs join the initiative independently of the NRL, which holds a lucrative contract with Sportsbet and is saturated with betting advertising. “Online sports betting is the fastest growing form of gambling and the NRL is the most popular sport to bet on in NSW,” said Natalie Wright, the director of the NSW government’s office of responsible gambling. “The NRL fan base is huge and gambling advertising is everywhere which means if you’re a supporter you can’t avoid seeing it. Sports betting companies know that visibility works, which is why they invest so much in advertising on the most popular code in NSW.”",Sport/Sport,NRL clubs move to distance themselves from gambling industry,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/03/nrl-clubs-move-to-distance-themselves-from-gambling-industry
