2/16/2022,"MI5 had enough intelligence to regard Salman Abedi as a threat to national security and open an investigation before he bombed the Manchester Arena, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds of others, an inquiry has heard. The Security Service was “struggling to cope” with an increased workload, and the team responsible for the north-west of England had declared an “amber” period of stress and high capacity the month before the attack in 2017.  The information, revealed on Tuesday, came from the testimony of four MI5 witnesses and 10 officers from north west counter-terrorism police, who gave evidence in closed sessions last year after the chair of the Manchester arena inquiry, Sir John Saunders, ruled it could compromise national security if it were heard in public. Families of those killed in the attack have said they are shocked and appalled and found the admission from one MI5 officer that he had raised concerns with superiors and worried something could “get through” due to the high volume of documents “difficult to swallow”. Summarising the evidence heard in secret over 10 days, Paul Greaney QC, counsel for the inquiry, said the MI5 officer who first assessed one piece of intelligence accepted during questioning that it could be understood, at the time, to indicate “activity of pressing national security concern”. Two pieces of intelligence received by MI5 in the months leading up to the attack were not passed to counter-terrorism police and the security services did not fully appreciate their significance. Had the significance of the intelligence been understood, two witnesses agreed further investigative steps might have been taken. Witnesses from counter-terrorism police and MI5 described IT systems for sharing information between them as “clunky” and “hit and miss” and the “system for triaging unsolicited intelligence was admitted to be a bit haphazard”. That system has now changed. A senior MI5 witness gave evidence that large electronic files would occasionally not send properly, so that PowerPoint presentations had to be sent slide by slide. Occasionally documents would be sent to police but it might not be realised for a day that they had not arrived. MI5 did not tell police that the agency had information that Abedi had travelled from Istanbul to Libya in May 2016, despite an intention to do so. One witness described the role of an MI5 investigator as being “like a spider in the centre of a web, with strands of intelligence from many sources coming together for them to assess”, while another said that the team in MI5 responsible for the north west was surprised by the pace of the change in workload after the declaration of a “caliphate” by Islamic State in 2014. The north west investigative team went into “amber” on its workload dashboard in April 2017, some of its casework was suspended that month and into May – the month of the attack. By the time Salman Abedi had murdered 22 people and injured hundreds more when he detonated a suicide vest at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017, he was a closed “subject of interest” after being red-flagged by the security services twice in 2014 and 2015. He first came on their radar in 2010, just before his 16th birthday. MI5 had intelligence that Abedi supported Islamic State, but one witness said there were a large number of people during this period who expressed such support who “did not pose a threat to UK national security”. Saunders said he understood the evidence had raised “questions that may not have been raised before”, and that would inform his conclusions, but were not a finding of fact. Kim Harrison, of Slater and Gordon, solicitor for families of 12 of the victims, said they were “deeply shocked and appalled by the evidence read today that the MI5 north west investigative team were struggling to cope with a significant increase and change in workload from 2015”. “To hear that concerns had apparently been raised with superiors regarding the triaging of intelligence, including worries that something could get through due to the volumes of documents being considered is difficult to swallow,” she said.",News/UK news,"MI5 had intel Manchester Arena bomber posed threat, inquiry told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/mi5-had-intel-manchester-arena-bomber-posed-threat-inquiry-told
2/16/2022,"Some stories feel so unbelievable that every time you think of them again, you have to sit with the basic concept for a few moments just to remind yourself how truly, staggeringly outrageous the whole business is. It’s almost as if your head has to be got round it all over again, every single time you go there. I’m like that with the Post Office scandal, which as of this week is the subject of an active public inquiry. In the spirit of rearranging our heads once more, let’s do the brief summary: between 2000 and 2014, 736 subpostmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted of theft, fraud and false accounting in the branches of the Post Office they ran. Their lives – and the lives of thousands of others – were torn apart. They were financially ruined, put out of work, locally shunned, driven into poor health and addiction, saw their marriages destroyed. Some – from a 19-year-old woman to mothers of young children to all manner of others – were imprisoned for many months. At least 33 victims of the scandal are now dead; at least four reportedly took their own lives. But … they had done nothing wrong. They had done nothing wrong. The blame in fact lay with Horizon, a faulty computer system designed by Fujitsu and imposed on their branches by Post Office management.  It is currently being described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. And here’s the kicker – many post office operators had been reporting problems with Horizon to the Post Office right from the outset. The Post Office not only failed to adequately investigate, but demanded the staff personally made up the financial shortfalls, and denied to the complainants that anyone else had similar issues. Up in the rarefied air of the executive suite was Paula Vennells, who took over as CEO in 2012. Under her leadership the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of subpostmasters. To this date, more than 20 years on for some cases, nobody from the Post Office or Fujitsu or the civil servants charged with oversight has been held accountable, much less faced criminal investigation themselves. Instead, victims’ heads have rolled. So that’s the short version, but of course it all feels inadequate. Even simply listing every individual injustice in the sparsest possible terms would take far more space than I have available; at even cursory depth, every single story is utterly heartbreaking and utterly extraordinary. And to add to the sheer WTF-ery, these are subpostmasters we’re talking about, often working meticulously for long hours serving small communities. It’s backbone of Britain stuff – and the prison doors clanged shut on them. Among other burning questions, then, the current inquiry will look at whether the Post Office bigwigs knew there were bugs and glitches in the computer system, but pushed ahead with the prosecuting and the life-ruining anyway. I don’t want to unleash too many spoilers here – it’s important that viewers get to experience the breakneck magic of a British public inquiry in real time – but let’s just say that a high court judge in 2019 described the Post Office’s approach as “the 21st-century equivalent of maintaining that the Earth is flat”. Other highlights of the story? You’ll enjoy the episode covering the bit where Post Office CEO Paula Vennells gets a CBE in the year 2019 (TWENTY NINETEEN), and then gets made both chair of London’s Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust and something called “a non-executive board member of the Cabinet Office”, presumably because the government thought it important to bring in our brightest brains from business. By way of an inspired satirical touch, Paula also moonlighted as an Anglican priest and as a member of the Church of England Ethical Investment Advisory Group. (She has since “stepped back” from these positions.) In 2019, after the Post Office agreed to pay nearly £58m to settle claims, Vennells issued a statement saying “I am truly sorry we were unable to find both a solution and a resolution outside of litigation and for the distress this caused.” Ah. Students of apology types may have identified this as the classic sorry-that-we-just-HAD-to-hound-you-into-court apology. It’s a real pro move, and your inability to execute it is why you, an amateur, live in fear of losing your livelihood, while hotshots like Paula & Co take millions and get bumped up into first class on the gravy train, no matter how monstrous their screw-ups. For while the postmasters have gone through the sort of wringer that makes Kafka feel like a Disney musical, extraordinary compassion has been shown to the managerial class in all this, who have been showered with honours and directorships and bonuses throughout. Elsewhere, it must be said that this sorry saga has not been the finest hour of much of the news media. Most papers and TV news outlets would now admit they horribly under-reported the Post Office story over the years, with all the running made by the likes of Private Eye, Computer Weekly and the BBC journalist Nick Wallis, to say nothing of the campaigning victims themselves, such as the heroic Alan Bates. As for the wider lessons of the scandal, what a lot it says about a society crossing the threshold of the third millennium that thousands of entirely upstanding human beings were disbelieved in favour of trusting a computer. Actually believing in the confusion and anguish of that famously gangsterish demographic – British subpostmasters – was regarded as a wholly irrational act. This, I’m afraid, is a version of only following orders. And it’s also, alas, the bit where those of us who cannot believe it happened simply have to look around us. Today, technology is deferred to even in the face of human tragedy far more than it was 20 years ago. Spool onward in the timeline and you will find more and more examples of ways in which technology was deemed to know best. In 2015, it emerged that in one three-year period, 2,380 sick and disabled people had died shortly after being declared “fit for work” by a computerised test, and having their sickness benefits withdrawn. Today, bereaved parents are told that nothing can be done about the algorithms that pushed their teenage children remorselessly in the direction of content they believe ultimately contributed to them taking their own lives, even as a Facebook whistleblower recently said that firm was “unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety”. At the time the Post Office scandal began unfolding, Facebook wasn’t even a glint in Mark Zuckerberg’s eye; now, many technology firms are more powerful than nation states. At the time, Little Britain’s Carol Beer worked as a bank teller or holiday rep; now, computer-says-no culture runs the world.

2/16/2022,"At the start, a stumble. At the end, tears. In between, a brush with perfection. And, amid the extraordinary tumult and torment of the past six days, Kamila Valieva did what she was trained to do: deliver when it matters.  After the first program of the women’s single skating at Beijing’s Capital Indoor Stadium, the 15-year-old leads on 82.16, less than two points ahead of her Russian Olympic Federation teammate Anna Shcherbakova. The Japanese skater Kaori Sakamoto, who scored 78.84, lies third. It wasn’t a perfect routine. No sooner had the opening bars of In Memoriam by Kirill Richter ended than Valieva wobbled and came dangerously close to falling on her first jump, the triple axel. But with the world’s gaze on her after her positive drugs test, she was able to refocus and scored top marks on her remaining elements. To do so with the world’s spotlight on her, with many questioning whether the 15-year-old Russian should still be in Beijing, was certainly impressive. But long before she stepped gracefully onto the ice the British skater Nastasha McKay was blunt when asked whether the Russian should be competing: “I wish it was a level playing field and it’s not, but they’ve made a decision they’ve made and I can’t do anything about that.” When invited to express sympathy for the 15-year-old, the Briton then deftly diverted her attention elsewhere. “I have sympathy for whoever will be on the podium who won’t be receiving their medals,” she replied. “It’s the most important part of the Olympics and they won’t get that chance.” The Swedish staker Josefin Taljegard refused to directly criticise Valieva but made her critique more subtly. “I think fair play is important,” she said. “Something inside me thinks it’s sad. I try to be a good role model. I just want everyone to know that figure skating is a lovely sport. These negative things take away from that. Hopefully, if not in this competition, we can win over the world to remember how amazing figure skating is.” Earlier in the day Valieva’s legal team had suggested that her positive drugs test may have come from a contaminated glass of water that contained traces of her grandfather’s heart medication. That explanation has raised eyebrows here in Beijing. But it is also worth pointing out that while the excitable coverage of the court of arbitration for sport’s decision to allow Valieva to compete made it sound she – and Russia – had received a diamanté-emblazoned get out of jail free card that is not the case. Cas’s decision was a stay of execution, not a pardon. And even if Valieva takes gold on Thursday, as now appears likely, it remains an odds-on chance that she gets a doping ban. She has captivated the world, and survived an extraordinary week that will have felled most people. But her dreams of having an Olympic medal around her neck still hang by a sequin’s thread.",Sport/Sport,Kamila Valieva: Russian skater in gold medal position in individual event,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/15/kamila-valieva-russian-skater-in-gold-medal-position-in-individual-event
2/16/2022,"‘If in doubt, get the breasts out.” That is not an official advertising slogan, but it might as well be. Cleavage has always been the uninspired ad man’s best friend. Flogging fast food? Show a bunch of busty models eating burgers in bikinis. Hawking ice-cream? Film a slow-motion shot of it dripping down a woman’s chest. Selling cars? Boobs. Selling home insurance? More boobs. You get the idea; you would have to be a boob not to. While breasts are not exactly unusual in adverts, Adidas’s new marketing campaign for its expanded range of sports bras takes things to the extreme. Instead of just showing a bit of cleavage, the advert features 25 pairs of bare breasts. Some are scarred; some are small; some are saggy; all of them are unapologetically uncovered. Accompanying the nudity are layers of predictable PR guff about how Adidas wants to celebrate inclusivity and showcase the many varieties of modern mammaries etc etc. Frankly, I would have respected the company a lot more if it just said: it is not that deep – we know this is guaranteed to get people talking, which means our brand name will worm its way into your unconscious and hopefully translate into a sales boost for our bras.  I don’t know how the bra sales are going, but the “get people talking” strategy is working. Some people have been celebrating Adidas’s advert for desexualising breasts; others have called it exploitative. “They are now trying to sell us objectification as if it’s liberation,” an associate professor of sociology at the University of California at Irvine told the Washington Post. We believe women’s breasts in all shapes and sizes deserve support and comfort. Which is why our new sports bra range contains 43 styles, so everyone can find the right fit for them.🔗 Explore the new adidas sports bra collection at https://t.co/fJZUEjvopQ#SupportIsEverything pic.twitter.com/CESqmsXOwI It is a fair point, but, after much consideration (I have been thinking about breasts all weekend), the former marketing professional in me has decided the ad is quite good, actually. Unlike male chests, women’s breasts are still ridiculously sexualised – so much so that female nipples are censored on Instagram. Adidas’s ad might be a shameless attention grab, but anything that helps normalise nipples is OK with me.

2/16/2022,"Florian Zeller’s brand of psychological theatre in which fractured inner states are expressed through form is undeniably slick. Like his Oscar-winning film, The Father (adapted from his play), this story of infidelity scrambles chronology and blends memory with fantasy to prove the slippery nature of reality. Part of its charm is in the unscrambling, though it remains a moot point whether style wins out over substance here. The story is a moral one – of unfaithfulness and its consequences – presented in the mould of a crime thriller. It revolves around Pierre, a distinguished surgeon whose affair leaves him unbalanced, possibly murderous.  He is a split self on stage, bifurcated through guilt and subterfuge, and his dominant half, Man 1, is superlatively performed by Toby Stephens, alongside Man 2 (Paul McGann). “Scenes play over and over again in my head,” he says, and they do on stage, too, with small variations each time, so that no one truth can be pinned down. Stephens has a casual entitlement but also shades of Dostoevsky’s Raskolnikov in his secret desire to be caught, to confess and be punished. Translated by Zeller’s long-term collaborator, Christopher Hampton, The Forest is masterly executed and captivating to watch, but without the same emotional depth and power of The Father. A jigsaw with a piece missing, the story allows us to project our own meaning in its gaps, but even then it feels slightly flat at times, and too bound up in Zeller’s signature style, which plays out like a similarly repeating game. It bears the intrigue of a thriller but resorts to cliches of the genre, too: the anonymous phone calls, the loose cannon of a lover, the quietly suspicious wife. Every woman on stage is not only betrayed but appears flat, particularly the lover (Angel Coulby), whose obsessive impulses veer into the “bunny boiler” stereotype. The wife (exquisitely played by Gina McKee) appears deliberately like a cipher, too. This may well be a reflection of the reduced way in which Man 1 sees them but they lack credibility as a result. Whatever its shortcomings, we cannot help but be seduced by this production. McKee sends shivers down the spine in the play’s final moments, and the rest of the cast is universally strong, especially a surreal, whey-faced interrogator played with controlled menace by Finbar Lynch. Elegantly directed by Jonathan Kent, every element of the stagecraft shines and delights. Rooms light up out of darkness with thrilling surprise: the lover’s bedsit above the family drawing room, an office space in which dreams are revealed and grubby bargains made. A single, mono-note of dread in Isobel Waller-Bridge’s sound design buzzes across the drama. Hugh Vanstone’s lighting is striking, and Anna Fleischle’s naturalistic set design is a good foil to the play’s skewed reality. The three rooms gradually begin connecting and at their most effective they capture the simultaneity of the moment for which Zeller seems so often to be striving. The end does not yield the catharsis of a crime thriller but appears, eerily, on pause – as if it will carry on repeating its churn of inner turmoil after we have left the auditorium. If this is all an elaborate exploration of guilt, it is guaranteed to spark fevered discussion after the lights go up, even if it has melted away by the morning after.

2/16/2022,"Melinda Simmons, the British ambassador to Ukraine, has been winning plaudits for her decision to stay in post in Kyiv, working with a much-reduced staff to help UK citizens out of the country and to manage the steady flow of British dignitaries still flying to the country to show their solidarity. Given the clarity, frequency and urgency of the British intelligence warnings of an imminent Russian invasion, including the possibility of airstrikes, it is surprising that she has until now insisted she remain in situ alongside a core team.  Her decision to stay put, along with most EU embassies, will be popular with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He is deeply unhappy that some western embassies – including the US, Canada and Australia – decided to move from Kyiv to Lviv or other cities in the west of the country. At a joint briefing on Monday Zelinskiy said he was determined to prevent an exodus of his political and business class, and questioned their logic. “There is no western Ukraine,” he said. “There is Ukraine; it is integral. Because if, God forbid, something happens, it will be everywhere.” Simmons’s decision to stay may also be an implicit admission that the Foreign Office did not cover itself in glory in its handling of the fall of Kabul. It might be thought that the Conservative press would treat her decision to stay put as a sign of the sangfroid on which the British diplomatic class like to pride themselves. But Douglas Murray, associate editor of the Spectator, took umbrage at her admissions that she sometimes needed to take walks to relieve herself of stress. “When exactly did Simmons-like behaviour become our national character? When did me-time and self-esteem replace stoicism? People used to talk of drawing on reserves in a crisis, not least because it gave confidence to our friends and allies as well as to ourselves. Clearly that isn’t the case now.” Those that know her say she is the most businesslike and focused of the new breed of female ambassadors, and has absolutely thrown herself into the job. Born in the East End of London to Jewish parents, her family is from Poland on her father’s side, but her mother’s side is both Lithuanian and Ukrainian. Fluent in German and French, she came into the diplomatic network in 2003 via the Department for International Development (DfID) relatively late – 10 years after university, and after spending time in advertising and marketing, which she quit in disillusionment, taking a 50% pay cut to work for a peace-building NGO. Her husband was a journalist specialising in Africa. Her DfID career had a heavy Africa focus and she specialised in conflict resolution and prevention. Her move to the Foreign Office in 2013, and to the National Security Secretariat, meant a drift from soft to harder power. In 2018 she started language training in preparation for taking up her post in Kyiv in 2019. For the de-stressing reviled by the Spectator she tries baking and boxing. Inside the Foreign Office she has tried to be a trailblazer, but admits it can be hard, once saying: “I think it’s really difficult to build the courage to speak up for yourself. Often for women, that’s just a step too far out of your comfort zone, plus there’s a real ‘why bother’ button that switches on in your head. Giving yourself permission to be heard is hugely empowering.” She awards herself one specialist skill – the ability to pick up the phone to anyone, no matter how senior, to get her point across. Apart from shepherding British citizens on to commercial flights or over the border into Poland, her key task is to manage the sometimes fractious relations between the Ukrainian government and Britain. There is for instance great resentment in Ukraine about the west’s dire warnings of a Russian invasion, warnings that the UK has been at the forefront of. She has also not been afraid to sound the alarm bells over any backsliding in Ukraine’s fight against corruption. She recently told one Ukrainian interviewer: “When Brits think about Ukraine, by large they think about corruption and they think about war.” She said pretty pictures of the Carpathian mountains or Odessa will not shift that narrative. By contrast, “positive stories about progress in tackling corruption and positive stories about Ukraine growing in strength as a confident democracy, these are the things that will alter the perceptions of Brits”.

2/16/2022,"Nine endangered wolves were shot in one day in Norway after a court ruled that a controversial hunt could go ahead. Fifty-one wolves were originally due to be slaughtered – a significant proportion of the 80 animals thought to live in Norway. But last month, activists secured a stay of execution when they got an injunction halting the hunt until an appeal over its validity could go ahead. They claimed that allowing hunters to kill wolves in a conservation zone would be against EU nature protection laws.  Twenty-five animals, within four packs, are in the “wolf zone”, an area of nature set aside to protect the predators, and these wolves were protected by the appeal. But last Friday, the Norwegian court of appeal reversed the district court’s interim injunction to halt the hunting of the wolf families within the “wolf zone” where the animals are allowed to breed, which makes up 5% of the country’s land. Over the weekend, hunts went out to find these animals, and nine were shot in a single day. The resulting images show bloodied wolves lying on the snowy ground. Karoline Andaur, the CEO of the WWF in Norway, said: “This is a loss not only for the wolves, but also for biodiversity and rule of law in nature conservation. The wolf is critically endangered in Norway, and we have a national responsibility to take care of it. “Now they are being shot just because they are living in Norwegian nature, even though they live in the wolf zone – an area where the authorities have decided that the wolf should have particularly strong protection.” The Guardian reported in January that conservation groups across Europe were appealing to the EU to take action against wolf population culls in Norway, Sweden and Finland, arguing that the Nordic nations were creating the most hostile environment for wolves in western Europe and flouting laws that protect the species. Last month, Finland suspended licences to kill three packs of wolves, citing EU legislation. Yet Norway’s government welcomed the court of appeal’s decision to lift the cull injunction. A spokesperson said: “I note with satisfaction that the court of appeal upholds us in that the state’s decision of 22 December 2021 to kill wolves belonging to four wolf packs within the wolf zone, is legal.” The Norwegian environment department added that measures to ensure the full quota of wolves is taken may be put in place. Siri Martinsen, who runs the nature group Noah, said: “We are shocked by the ruling. The court does not evaluate the consequences of letting the state cull critically endangered wolves with the main aim of keeping them critically endangered.” Other European countries have introduced anti-wolf policies. Hunters in Sweden have already shot dead most of their annual target of 27 wolves. In Germany, where wolves have appeared in recent years having entered from neighbouring countries, there has been a debate over the predators’ impact on agriculture. In the UK, there are fierce arguments over whether wolves should ever be reintroduced.",News/Environment,Wolves shot in Norway after court overturns stay of execution,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/wolves-shot-norway-cull-conservation-zone
