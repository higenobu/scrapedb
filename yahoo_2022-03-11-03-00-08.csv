3/11/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A prosecutor cast an ex-convict Thursday as a mobster-like figure who coerced his daughter’s college friends to join his “family” as he accumulated power, sex and money, forcing one woman into a sex work enterprise so lucrative that she gave him $1 million in a single year. A defense lawyer, though told the Manhattan federal court jury during the trial's opening statements that Lawrence Ray committed no federal crimes as he encircled himself with college-age “storytellers"" who claimed to have poisoned him and arranged to have him physically attacked. “You'll see that Larry Ray is not guilty,"" attorney Allegra Glashausser said. Ray, who once served as the best man at a wedding of former New York City police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, has been incarcerated since his early 2020 arrest. Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindsey Keenan began her opening statement with a description of a gruesome October 2018 attack she said Ray carried out on a woman who gave Ray over a million dollars in sex work proceeds that year alone. She said Ray and a woman who served as his “trusted lieutenant"" found the woman they had “forced into a life of prostitution"" at a hotel, where Ray tortured her for hours to make sure she'd continue her sex work. The prosecutor said Ray used “violence, fear, sex and manipulation"" to gain sex, power and money. The abuse began in the fall of 2010 when Ray began living in his daughter's on-campus small townhouse dormitory dwelling at Sarah Lawrence College, where he persuaded his daughter's friends to stay the next summer at his Manhattan apartment, she said. There, Keenan said, Ray learned their secrets and insecurities and exploited them, “profiting off their labor, their money and even their bodies."" “Once he gained control of their lives, ... he took over their lives,"" she said. The women were forced to do manual labor for Ray in 2013 in North Carolina at his stepfather's home and obey his commands after he convinced them they owed him money for damaging some of his belongings or for trying to poison him, the prosecutor said. Against threats to release their secrets and embarrassing videotaped moments to friends and family or on the internet, the women and at least one man complied with Ray's demands, she said. “When shame and embarrassment were not enough, he relied on violence,"" Keenan said. “The victims had no choice. They lived in fear of the defendant."" The allegations against Ray attained public prominence with the 2020 publication of “The Stolen Kids of Sarah Lawrence,” a New York magazine feature. Glashausser, an assistant federal defender, disputed the prosecutor's portrayal. She said her client was seeking to reconnect with his daughter when he went to her dormitory and told stories about “hobnobbing"" with Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet Union president, being best man at Kerik's wedding and having friends who were U.S. military generals. Soon, the college students told stories about their own lives, embellishing them with tales of having drugged drug dealers and other exploits, she said. “This was not a criminal enterprise,"" Glashausser said. “This was a group of storytellers."" Glashausser said some of the women battled mental illness issues and frightened Ray when they told him they had poisoned him, prompting him to seek help from prosecutors, the Environmental Protection Agency and journalists. She said they also set him up to be physically attacked. She said the woman who became a sex worker “started escorting"" in 2015 when she could not afford her rent. She said jurors would see videos her client had recorded and “see some things that are hard to watch."" “I'm not saying that Larry Ray is a saint,"" Glashausser said. “You don't have to like him. But these things were not crimes.""",U.S./Associated Press,"Prosecutor: Larry Ray coerced college women for sex, money",https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutor-larry-ray-coerced-college-174207945.html
3/11/2022,"(Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that sanctions imposed against Russia would rebound against the West, including in the form of higher food and energy prices, and Moscow would solve its problems and emerge stronger. Putin said there had been no alternative to what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine and that Russia was not a country which could accept compromising its sovereignty for some sort of short-term economic gain. ""These sanctions would have been imposed in any case,"" Putin told a meeting of the Russian government. ""There are some questions, problems and difficulties but in the past we have overcome them and we will overcome them now. ""In the end, this will all lead to an increase in our independence, self-sufficiency and our sovereignty,"" he told a televised government meeting two weeks after Russian forces invaded neighbouring Ukraine. His comments were designed to portray Western sanctions as self-defeating and reassure Russians that the country can withstand what Moscow is calling an ""economic war"" against its banks, businesses and business oligarchs. Putin said Moscow - a major energy producer that supplies a third of Europe's gas - would continue to meet its contractual obligations even though it has been slammed with comprehensive sanctions including a ban on U.S. purchases of its oil. ""They announced that they are closing the import of Russian oil to the American market. Prices there are high, inflation is unprecedentedly high, has reached historic highs. They are trying to blame the results of their own mistakes on us,"" he said. ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it."" Hitting back against the West, the Russian government said earlier it had banned exports of telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, among other items, until the end of 2022. In total, over 200 items were included on the export suspension list, which also covered railway cars, containers, turbines and other goods. 'WE WILL SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS' Speaking calmly, Putin acknowledged that sanctions imposed since the Feb. 24 invasion were being felt. ""It is clear that at such moments people's demand for certain groups of goods always increases, but we have no doubt that we will solve all these problems while working in a calm fashion,"" he said. ""Gradually, people will orient themselves, they will understand that there are simply no events that we cannot close off and solve."" Putin noted that Russia is a major producer of agricultural fertilisers, and said there would be inevitable ""negative consequences"" for world food markets if the West made problems for Russia. His agriculture minister reported at the meeting that the country's food security was ensured. Speaking at the same meeting, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia had taken measures to limit the outflow of capital and that the country would service its external debts in roubles, not in dollars. ""Over the last two weeks Western countries have in essence waged an economic and financial war against Russia,"" he said. Siluanov said the West had defaulted on its obligations to Russia by freezing its gold and foreign currency reserves. It was trying to halt foreign trade, he said. ""In these conditions the priority is for us to stabilise the situation in the financial system,"" Siluanov said.

3/11/2022,"(Adds Lavrov, Zelenskiy) By Mark Trevelyan LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday shifted its stance over the bombing of a Ukrainian hospital in the city of Mariupol, with a mix of statements that veered between aggressive denials and a call by the Kremlin to establish clear facts. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy said three people including a child had been killed in the bombing on Wednesday, and rejected Russian assertions there had been no patients there. ""Like always, they lie confidently,"" said Zelenskiy, who has accused Moscow of waging genocide in the war it launched two weeks ago. In the face of worldwide condemnation there were rare signs of inconsistency in the response from Russian officials, who since the start of Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 have stuck tightly to the same narrative for what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked for comment in the immediate aftermath, told Reuters on Wednesday: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."" On Thursday he said the Kremlin would look into the incident. ""We will definitely ask our military, because you and I don't have clear information about what happened there,"" Peskov told reporters. ""And the military are very likely to provide some information."" Other Russian officials took a more aggressive line, rejecting the hospital bombing as fake news. ""This is information terrorism,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attacked what he called ""pathetic shouting about so-called atrocities by the Russian armed forces"". He told reporters after meeting Ukraine's foreign minister in Turkey that the hospital building had for days been under the control of ultra-radical Ukrainian forces who had emptied out the doctors and patients - the version rejected by Zelenskiy as a lie. Moscow says it is conducting a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and the West reject these as false pretexts for an invasion of a democratic country of 44 million people. On Wednesday, the United States denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"".
