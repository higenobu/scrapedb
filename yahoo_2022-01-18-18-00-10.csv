1/18/2022,"Donald Trump-devoted Republicans were slammed for hypocrisy for their tributes to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on MLK Day on Monday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) Rep. Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.) and former White House press secretaries Kayleigh McEnany (now a Fox News host) and Sarah Huckabee Sanders (now a Republican candidate for Arkansas governor) all praised the civil rights icon on Twitter on the annual celebration of his life. From the halls of Ebenezer Baptist Church to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, #MLK spent his life spreading what he called ""the gospel of freedom."" He never gave up and never preached hate.

His words and example inspire us today as we celebrate a great American on #MLKDay. — Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) January 17, 2022 Dr. King was a true fighter for social justice who believed in the potential of America.

His vision for our nation was best summed up by his quote — “We may have all come on different ships but we’re in the same boat now.” pic.twitter.com/IJsi6CnyQu — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 17, 2022 Let us continue to honor Dr. King’s legacy and works both today and in the days to come. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 17, 2022 Today, we remember Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. - an American hero and a man of great faith and courage! https://t.co/ve2k4zsHCO — Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) January 17, 2022 “Even in the inevitable moments when all seems hopeless, men know that without hope they cannot really live, and in agonizing desperation they cry for the bread of hope.” – Martin Luther King Jr. — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) January 17, 2022 The relentless pursuit of freedom that Martin Luther King Jr. possessed should be living on in all of us.

Let us all remember the incredible life and legacy of this great American hero. — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 17, 2022 Today we celebrate the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr — an American hero who fought against the evil of racism. We are all made in God’s image, and may we continue to be inspired by his life and legacy #MLKDay — Sarah Huckabee Sanders (@SarahHuckabee) January 17, 2022 But their tributes rang hollow for many people, given their defense of Trump’s racist rhetoric over the years and GOP efforts at voter suppression. This pathetic hypocrite spends 364 days a year opposing voting rights, and then shamelessly tweets this today. https://t.co/6muMrmrZM7 — Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) January 17, 2022 What Charles Booker said. https://t.co/JgqmF7Qkv1 — Virginia Buysse, PhD (@VirginiaBuysse) January 17, 2022 History will not look kindly on you and your abject hypocrisy. https://t.co/XoLFqyiSD9 — Joe Madison on a Hunger Strike *DAY 71* (@MadisonSiriusXM) January 17, 2022 I hope you will be denouncing past associations & working towards what you speak of in this tweet. https://t.co/t3D5qz8cpE — Mr. Hughes (@marcus_jh) January 17, 2022 This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",Politics/HuffPost,Donald Trump-Loving Republicans Celebrate MLK Day And Get Told Where To Go,https://news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-loving-republicans-celebrate-080245991.html
1/18/2022,"A Minnesota woman whose husband neared death from COVID appealed to the courts to force his hospital to halt their plans to pull the plug on the man’s ventilator. Scott Quiner, 55, a reportedly unvaccinated man who had been battling COVID in Mercy Hospital’s ICU in Coon Rapids since November, was set to have his ventilator shut off on Jan. 13, according to a petition filed in court one day before the deadline by his wife, Anne Quiner. Quiner said the decision by the hospital would “end my husband’s life” and appealed to the Anoka County Court for a restraining order against the hospital. “Absent an Order from the court,” she wrote in the petition, “my husband will die.” Unvaxxed Lunch Lady Wants You to See Her COVID Death Spiral On Jan. 13, a district court judge ordered Mercy Hospital not to turn off Quiner’s ventilator. On Monday morning, Marjorie Holsten, an attorney representing Quiner’s wife, told the Star Tribune that Quiner has now been transferred to a hospital in Texas. ""The doctor said Scott was the most undernourished patient he has ever seen,” Holsten told the outlet. “The last update I got was yesterday afternoon after some tests had been run; all organs are working except his lungs.” Holsten did not name the Texas hospital. In a statement to The Daily Beast, Holsten said Quiner arrived in Texas ""severely malnourished"" and that he is currently ""receiving necessary nutrition, hydration, and treatments that were requested of the Minnesota hospital and not provided."" ""We believe he has turned the corner and is taking baby steps in the right direction,"" she added. Allina Health, which runs Mercy Hospital, pushed back on criticism of their care in a statement to The Daily Beast. ""Allina Health has great confidence in the exceptional care provided to our patients, which is administered according to evidence-based practices by our talented and compassionate medical teams,"" a spokesperson said. Due to patient privacy, the hospital declined to comment on the specific care provided to Quiner. ""Allina Health continues to wish the patient and family well,"" the spokesperson said. According to a screenshot of Quiner’s chart included in his wife’s court filings, staff at the hospital noted on Jan. 12 that Quiner’s “care plan” called for the end of ventilator support on Jan. 13. “Family would be able to be present at the bedside,” the chart read. In a motion following the court order halting that plan, attorneys for Mercy Hospital said Quiner’s medical care and treatment was “based on best available medical science and authority.” However, Quiner’s wife said in her petition that she “vehemently” disagreed with Mercy Hospital’s doctors. Anne Quiner did not respond to a request for comment. In a recent interview with FOX9, Holsten, the family attorney, applauded the ruling. “I don’t think the judge wanted to be on the wrong side of saying, ‘Well, of course, you should be able to pull the plug,’” she said. “I think the world is watching what is going on with Scott, and as he gets better and better, we’re gonna see that, you know what, there are protocols that should be used that hospitals have not been using,” Holsten told the outlet. “I’m hoping that changes are going to be made as a result of this case.” Quiner’s care has drawn attention across the country, and his family has raised more than $70,000 on GoFundMe and GiveSendGo.
