4/14/2022,"Malaysian influencer Siew Pui Yi sparked outrage over photos of herself wearing the Vietnamese national dress without pants. Social media users accused the 23-year-old of being ""disrespectful"" towards Vietnamese culture. Siew, who has 17.5 million Instagram followers, deleted the photos and issued an apology online. A Malaysian influencer has apologized after sparking outrage in Vietnam over photos she shared of herself wearing the country's national dress — but without pants. Siew Pui Yi, who has 17.5 million followers on Instagram and 717,000 followers on Facebook, had posted several pictures of herself last week donning an ao dai, minus the pants that usually accompany the outfit's tunic top. In the photos taken in the historic Vietnamese town of Hoi An, her thong is clearly visible as she releases a flower-shaped paper lantern on the Hoai River — a traditional custom signifying a prayer for peace. The backlash against Siew was swift, with angry social media users accusing her of being ""disrespectful"" of Vietnamese culture. Hoi An's Culture and Information Department Head Tong Quoc Hung also commented on Siew's actions, noting that ""the female tourist revealing her underwear in the ancient town of Hoi An is offensive,"" per Vietnamese news outlet VnExpress. Siew has since deleted the photos, but not before screenshots of the images were circulated online. Last Wednesday, the 23-year-old issued an apology on Facebook in Vietnamese, English and Chinese. ""To my recent travel to Vietnam, there was a posting of mine that truly upset the people, and I deeply and sincerely apologize for my actions/content and the disrespect to the traditional culture of Vietnam, to which I have now taken down,"" she wrote. ""I do hope to have another opportunity to be back in Vietnam and of course, take a different approach to shooting my content! I apologize once again, and will be more sensitive to the local cultures all over the world."" Siew did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Known for posting pictures of herself in skimpy clothing, Siew made the cover of US adult magazine Penthouse in January. In a Facebook post, Siew claimed she is the first woman from Southeast Asia to be featured on the magazine's cover.   Read the original article on Insider",World/INSIDER,Influencer and one-time Penthouse cover model apologizes after sparking outrage for wearing the Vietnamese national dress without pants,https://news.yahoo.com/influencer-one-time-penthouse-cover-042151626.html
4/14/2022,"Humanity's expansion across the globe is inextricably tied to the environmental conditions that our early ancestors faced. On Wednesday, a research team from South Korea's Pusan National University revealed research from supercomputing modeling that suggests just how much of humanity's rise is thanks to changes in prehistoric weather. The Pusan team, led by climate physicist Axel Timmermann, used an ""unprecedented transient Pleistocene-coupled general circulation model simulation in combination with an extensive compilation of fossil and archaeological records to study the spatiotemporal habitat suitability for five hominin species over the past 2 million years,"" per the study published in Nature. That 2-million year model, which the team refers to as the 2ma simulation, ""reproduces key palaeoclimate records such as tropical sea surface temperatures, Antarctic temperatures, the eastern African hydroclimate and the East Asian summer monsoon in close agreement with paleo-reconstructions,"" to ensure a realistic representation of how the rain patterns in Southern Africa were likely shifting at the time. Basically, the team was looking at how the 41,000-year cyclical patterns of precipitation and temperature change caused by the Earth's axial wobble impacted the availability of resources for early humans and our close cousins. By combining the synthetic data generated by the 2ma simulation with the hard evidence of fossil and archaeological findings, the team puzzled out the places where homo sapiens and our genetic offshoots were most likely to inhabit. The Pusan team noted a few surprising trends emerging from the data. For example, the researchers found that around 700,000 years ago, Homo heidelbergensis (suspected to be the progenitors of both Neanderthals and modern humans) began expanding from their traditional range. They were able to do so because our planet's elliptical orbit created wetter, more habitable climate conditions at that time to support the expansion. The simulation projected the movement of these wet spots across the Earth and the researchers found evidence within the fossil record that moved along with them. “The global collection of skulls and tools is not randomly distributed in time,” Timmermann told Nature. “It follows a pattern.” Timmermann explained that these results could support the single-evolutionary-path hypothesis, which posits that climate change 700,000 years ago led to hotter, drier conditions in South Africa and h. heidelbergensis' evolutionary response to those changes eventually gave rise to Homo sapiens. ""We acknowledge that our species subdivisions may be controversial and that these do not necessarily require constancy of morphology, habitat and behaviour,"" the team wrote. ""However, even though some species attributions such as H. heidelbergensis could be questioned, we remain confident that the majority of the record presents little challenge considering that 86 percent of the core data belong to the well-defined, widely accepted H. neanderthalensis or H. sapiens record and tool-making traditions."" These findings won't likely end the debate on humanity's beginnings but rather add to our growing patchwork of understanding.",Science/Engadget,Supercomputer simulations show climate change’s role in early human migration,https://news.yahoo.com/supercomputer-simulations-show-climate-changes-role-in-early-human-migration-203531329.html
