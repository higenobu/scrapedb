4/23/2022,"Sarah Shulze was energetic, ambitious, committed. She served her hometown of Oak Park as a member of the National Charity League and was a dedicated member of the Associated Student Body at Oak Park High for four years. She was the senior class secretary in 2019 and helped plan the senior prom. In her time at the University of Wisconsin, she earned an internship to the Wisconsin state Legislature and volunteered as a poll worker for the 2020 presidential election. Shulze was worldly, with her thirst for adventure taking her on trips to Europe, Africa and Alaska. She was a stellar athlete, too. Shultz's powerhouse senior season in cross country for Oak Park High included a Coastal Canyon League title, a CIF-Southern Section Division 3 championship and a runner-up finish in the CIF-State Division III finals. At season's end, Shulze was named The Star's Runner of the Year for 2018. She, in turn, earned a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin. Now that bright light has been extinguished, at least in life. Her family has announced that the 21-year-old Shulze died on April 13 in Wisconsin. They revealed, in a website posting, that their daughter ""took her own life."" ""Balancing athletics, academics and the demands of every day life overwhelmed her in a single, desperate moment,"" the posting said. She is survived by her parents, Brigitte and Scott, and sisters Abbey and Ella. ""She was surrounded by her loving family,"" the tribute website said. It is the family's hope that their daughter's suicide helps awaken others to the fragility of mental health. Shulze will be honored in Ventura County in a Celebration of Life ceremony set for May 2 at 3 p.m. at Calvary Community Church in Westlake Village. The address is 5495 Via Rocas. The family said all are welcome. A similar ceremony will be held Sunday at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Shulze is remembered affectionately by those who knew her at Oak Park High. ""The world is a better place for Sarah having been part of it,"" said athletic director Tim Chevalier. ""While her passing has been difficult to process, I take hope that her stories will continue to be told and her positive impact on others will be remembered."" Chevalier said Shulze excelled in sports and in life. ""In the classroom, Sarah was a top-notch student,"" he said. ""On the track, Sarah was a fierce competitor who absolutely electric and continually pushed herself to be great. ""Off the track, Sarah was a gentle and kind soul, a loving daughter, sister, friend and human who will be dearly missed by those who knew her and loved her."" Dr. Jeff Davis was appointed superintendent of the Oak Park Unified School District after Shulze's high school graduation, but noted her impact on the school and community. ""I sadly never had the honor to know Sarah,"" he said. ""However, I can tell you that Sarah left a lasting and indelible imprint on the Oak Park Unified School District, Oak Park High School and the community of Oak Park that will never, ever go away. ""Sarah was a top student, a tremendous athlete and teammate, a wonderful friend, and a loving daughter and sister. She will be missed by so many, yet never forgotten by those that were fortunate to know her."" The University of Wisconsin said its community is ""heartbroken."" ""Sarah was a beloved daughter, sister, granddaughter, friend, teammate and Badger student-athlete,"" the statement read. ""We extend our deepest sympathies and sincere condolences to Sarah's family, friends and Badger teammates during this extraordinarily difficult time. Our primary focus is the support of the Shulze family and our student-athletes."" Among Shulze's athletic exploits as an Oak Park senior was winning five of eight cross country races in which she competed, including the CIF-SS Division 3 title with a time of 17 minutes, 15.9 seconds. Among her proudest achievements was winning the Ventura County Championship at Lake Casitas with a time of 17:30.3, then the No. 6 all-time mark in the race. In addition to her success in cross country, Shulze starred in track and field for the Eagles. She won league and Ventura County championships in the 1,600 and 3,200 races and capped it all by winning the 3,200 title in both the CIF-Southern Section and Masters Meet. As a junior for the Badgers, Shulze recently finished first in the 3,000 meters and notched a personal best in the mile at the Larry Wieczorkek Invitational. Her high school coach, Steve White, noted in The Star's story honoring her cross country achievements as a senior that Shulze relied on more than physical ability. ""She has that unique gift to go out there and punish herself,"" said White. ""Knowing what it's going to take to meet the goals she would set. It goes to her mental toughness."" Her family, in the website posting, said Shulze was instilled with deep compassion for others. ""Above all other things, Sarah was a power for good in the world,"" they wrote. ""Her deep compassion was evident in her devotion to her sisters Abbey and Ella, the love her parents felt from her every single day and the extra care she took in moments shared with her grandparents and cousins."" Shulze's death is the second tragedy involving a former Ventura County standout athlete in the past two months. Katie Meyer, a former Newbury Park High soccer standout and Stanford University star, took her own life on March 1 at her residence on the Palo Alto campus.

4/23/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that Moscow was still waiting for Ukraine's response to Russia's latest written proposal in peace talks between the two sides, and questioned why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was unaware of the document. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday he had not seen or heard about the text the Kremlin said it had sent. ""I repeat once again, as I said yesterday, our formulations, in fact the latest version, were handed to our opponents, to the Ukrainian negotiating delegation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said the Kremlin was aware of Zelenskiy's comment, ""which also raises certain questions about why no one is reporting to President Zelenskiy about our versions of the text"". The comments from the two sides appeared to highlight both the gulf in their positions and the poor state of communication between them, eight weeks after Russia sent its troops and tanks into Ukraine and more than three weeks after they last held face-to-face talks on March 29. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on April 12 that the talks had come to a dead end. Ukraine's chief negotiator said on Tuesday it was hard to predict when they might resume because of Russia's siege of Mariupol and what he said was Moscow's desire to strengthen its position through a new military offensive. Russia says it was forced to launch its ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, and protect Russian-speakers there from ""genocide"" - arguments denounced by Kyiv and the West as baseless pretexts for war. Moscow wants Kyiv to accept the loss of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and of the eastern Donbas region which is now the focus of the Russian offensive. Ukraine says it will not compromise on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

4/23/2022,"HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — Texas’ oldest death row inmate was executed Thursday for killing a Houston police officer during a traffic stop nearly 32 years ago. Carl Wayne Buntion, 78, was executed at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the June 1990 fatal shooting of Houston police officer James Irby, a nearly 20-year member of the force. The U.S. Supreme Court had declined a request by Buntion’s attorneys to stop his execution. “I wanted the Irby family to know one thing: I do have remorse for what I did,” Buntion said while strapped to the Texas death chamber gurney. ""I pray to God that they get the closure for me killing their father and Ms. Irby's husband. “I hope to see you in heaven some day and when you show up I will give you a big hug.” Buntion, joined by his spiritual adviser, began praying Psalm 23, “The Lord is my Shepherd...” as the lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital began. He took a deep breath, coughed once, then took three less pronounced breaths before all movement stopped. He was pronounced dead at 6:39 p.m., 13 minutes later. Several dozen motorcyclists, showing support for the slain motorcycle officer, loudly revved their engines as the execution took place, the roar clearly audible in the death chamber. Buntion had been on parole for just six weeks when he shot the 37-year-old Irby. Buntion, who had an extensive criminal record, was a passenger in the car that Irby pulled over. In 2009, an appeals court vacated Buntion’s sentence, but another jury resentenced him to death three years later. “I feel joy,"" the officer's widow, Maura Irby, said after watching Buntion's execution. “I'm sorry someone died. But I didn't think of him as a person. I just thought of him as a thing, as a cancer on the face of my family.” Before his slaying, James Irby had talked of retirement and spending more time with his two children, who at the time were 1 and 3 years old, Maura Irby, 60, said earlier. “He was ready to fill out the paperwork and stay home and open a feed store,” she said. “He wanted to be the dad that was there to go to all the ballgames and the father daughter dances. He was a super guy, the love of my life.” Leading up to his execution, various state and federal courts had also turned down appeals by Buntion’s lawyers to stop his death sentence. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Tuesday had rejected his clemency request. Buntion’s attorneys said he was responsible for Irby’s death and “deserved to be punished severely for that crime.” But they argued his execution was unconstitutional because the jury’s finding he would be a future danger to society — one of the reasons he was given a death sentence— has proven incorrect, and also his execution would serve no legitimate purpose because so much time has passed since his conviction. His attorneys described Buntion as a geriatric inmate who posed no threat as he suffers from arthritis, vertigo and needed a wheelchair. “This delay of three decades undermines the rationale for the death penalty ... Whatever deterrent effect there is diminished by delay,” his attorneys David Dow and Jeffrey Newberry, wrote in court documents. With his execution, Buntion became the oldest person Texas has put to death since the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976. The oldest inmate executed in the U.S. in modern times was Walter Moody Jr., who was 83 years old when he was put to death in Alabama in 2018. Buntion was also the first inmate executed in Texas in 2022. Although Texas has been the nation’s busiest capital punishment state, it had been nearly seven months since it carried out an execution. There have been only three executions in each of the last two years, due in part to the coronavirus pandemic and delays over legal questions about Texas’ refusal to allow spiritual advisers to touch inmates and pray aloud in the death chamber. In March, the U.S. Supreme Court said states must accommodate requests to have faith leaders pray and touch inmates during executions. As Texas prepared to execute Buntion, officials in Tennessee canceled the execution of an inmate Thursday in what would have been the state's first execution since the start of the pandemic. Oscar Smith, 72, was scheduled to die for the 1989 killings of his estranged wife and her teenage sons. Republican Gov. Bill Lee didn’t elaborate on what issue forced the surprise 11th-hour stop to the planned execution. Texas prison officials agreed to Buntion’s request to allow his spiritual adviser to pray aloud and touch him while he was put to death. The adviser, Barry Brown, placed his right hand on Buntion's right ankle in the moments before the drugs began flowing and prayed for about five minutes. He said Buntion no longer was the “hard-headed young man” but had been “humbled by the walls and cold steel of prison.” While the execution stirred up painful memories for her, Irby said it also reminded her of her advocacy work in public safety after her husband’s death, including helping put together legislation that allowed victim impact statements at trials. “I still miss him, 32 years later,” she said Thursday night. ___ Lozano reported from Houston. ___ Follow Juan A.

4/23/2022,"Madison Cawthorn apparently has a thing for donning lingerie. Politico obtained photos that appear to show Cawthorn partying in racy attire and wearing hoop earrings.

It’s unclear when the photos were taken, but Politico notes that they appear to show Cawthorn sitting in a wheelchair, indicating they were taken after the 2014 accident that left him partially paralyzed. In a speech to supporters last weekend, Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a ""thug"" and said Ukraine's government was ""incredibly evil."" Cawthorn responded in a tweet on Friday. “I guess the left thinks goofy vacation photos during a game on a cruise (taken waaay before I ran for Congress) is going to somehow hurt me?” he wrote. “They’re running out of things to throw at me…” Cawthorn pins the leak on “the left,” but as Politico noted, the photos came from someone formerly close to Cawthorn, who is currently trying to fend off slew of conservative challengers in what is shaping up to be a hotly contested Republican primary to represent his North Carolina district. I guess the left thinks goofy vacation photos during a game on a cruise (taken waaay before I ran for Congress) is going to somehow hurt me?

The lawmaker does, however, have a lengthy rap sheet of offensive behavior and comments. Cawthorn has been accused of sexual misconduct. He’s lied about his car accident, his academic record, and his opponent in his 2020 congressional race. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Cawthorn also admitted he lied about his recent comments about congressional orgies and cocaine use among his colleagues. Rolling Stone reported in October that Cawthorn was one of several lawmakers who participated in the planning of the rally near the White House that preceded the riot at the Capitol last Jan. 6. He’s since repeatedly pushed false claims about fraud in the 2020 election, and even warned that “bloodshed” could result if Republicans should feel any future elections are stolen. But while Cawthorn is free to do his thing and be himself, it would be nice if he, a lawmaker, would stop trying to make it harder for others to do the same. Cawthorn has also been an opponent of transgender rights, and he scolded Democrats earlier this month about what he claims is the only true way to define a woman. Rep.
