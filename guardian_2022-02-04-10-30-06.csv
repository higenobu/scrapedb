2/4/2022,"Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has compared Western Australia’s ongoing border closure to the totalitarian state of North Korea. Speaking on 3AW on Friday, Joyce lamented there wasn’t a plan in WA for when the state would re-welcome domestic travellers after the initial reopening date of 5 February was scrapped indefinitely last month.  “You can’t even travel around your own country … it’s starting to look like North Korea,” he told presenters Ross and Russel. “We thought we had a date for that border to be opened … but that was stepped back from, it’s disappointed tens of thousands of people that had booked to go to WA. “I think we should all be a bit outraged by it … we’re supposed to be all Australians.” North Korea – officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – is widely considered to hold the worst human rights record in the world and has been repeatedly condemned by the United Nations, the European Union and the Human Rights Watch. In response to the pandemic, North Korea’s leadership ordered soldiers on the border with Russia and China to “unconditionally shoot” on sight anyone entering the state without permission. Citizens were banned from nearly all international travel, and almost all trade was limited to the movement of essential personnel and goods, preventing foods and other essentials from reaching the country and causing a shortage of basic necessities. “North Korea used Covid-19 restrictions to further oppress the North Korean people while igniting a crisis over access to food, medicine, and other essential goods,” Lina Yoon, senior Korea researcher at Human Rights Watch, said. But Joyce said the ongoing closure of Australia to some tourists and business travellers defied logic in light of the nation’s Omicron wave and was comparative to a dictatorship like that of North Korea. He said Qantas had lost “millions of dollars” in flight cancellations when McGowan made the decision to keep the borders shut to interstate travellers. “When you look at the detail of it, we have higher per capita cases of Covid than a lot of these countries … the UK, the US, most European countries,” he said. “We ask people to be fully vaccinated, so they’re less likely to end up in hospital … I don’t get the logic, and I think we should be opening up the borders … as soon as possible.” Australia’s international border is open to residents and some visa holders including students backpackers and skilled migrants, however tourists and business travellers from most countries remain unable to enter the nation. Since late November, 56,000 international students have arrived in Australia and more than 50,000 overseas student visa lodgements have been made. Around 28,000 Working Holiday Maker visas have been approved since the reopening of the border to some travellers, with a 17% increase in arrivals in the past week. Prime minister Scott Morrison has said he would like to see the international border fully operational “well before” Easter of this year. But Joyce said the continued closures were causing significant damage to businesses and the tourism sector. “It is very confusing here for a lot of people, and it is very hard for a lot of people,” he said. “We should be getting on and living with Covid like we are in the eastern states today … the fact that we can travel to London but we can’t travel to Perth, I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with the federation if that’s happening.” Earlier this week, Perth Airport announced it would close terminal 1 from Monday due to low passenger numbers. All Virgin services will move to terminal 2. Some business leaders including Qantas chairman Richard Goyder are relocating to the east coast in response to the prolonged border closure. WA premier Mark McGowan said it would be “irresponsible” to allow the borders to fully reopen on 5 February in light of the Omicron wave, and said rules would be reviewed in the coming weeks. “It would cause a surge in cases, a surge in hospitalisations, and result in thousands of people not being able to work or go to school. We know that bad health outcomes lead to economic pain,” he said. Some 91.77% of eligible Western Australians had received two vaccination doses, while 838,933 people had received their booster shot. The state recorded no new cases of community transmission on Friday and two new cases detected in hotel quarantine.",News/Australia news,Qantas boss Alan Joyce compares Western Australia border restrictions to North Korea,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/qantas-boss-alan-joyce-compares-western-australia-border-restrictions-to-north-korea
2/4/2022,"It is rare indeed for a journalist to break a big story while simultaneously being at the centre of another big story – all in a space of a single day. But as Peter van Onselen prepared to ask Scott Morrison his bombshell question about the “psycho” text messages at the National Press Club on Tuesday, news was breaking that he was named in a lawsuit brought against the Ten network by political reporter Tegan George. It was a milestone day for the political academic, who was dubbed “the work experience kid” when former editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell hired him as a columnist at the Australian 13 years ago, praising him as “the next Paul Kelly”.  Ten’s political editor has been accused of undermining and humiliating George, according to a statement of claim filed in the federal court, a claim he denies. With trademark confidence, PVO soldiered on, appearing on TV and radio to talk about his scoop. Later, the prime minister had a sledge of his own, saying: “The journalist who raised it is facing his own questions,” when he was asked about the texts in which the PM was called a “horrible person” by Gladys Berejiklian. When PVO didn’t appear on his usual commentary slot on RN Breakfast on Thursday many wondered: had the ABC dumped him in light of the allegations? Well, no, but he has been dumped. The new RN host, Patricia Karvelas, has replaced Van Onselen with Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy. Weekly Beast understands the decision has nothing to do with the lawsuit, or his much-maligned column about the former Australia of the year Grace Tame. PK’s new team wanted more gender diversity; and will now have three male and three female commentators over the week: Michelle Grattan, Phil Coorey, David Crowe, Murph, and Samantha Maiden and David Speers on Fridays for a look back at the week in politics. A fundraiser set up for George’s legal fees raised more than $42,000 in a couple of days, some of it from Ten colleagues who told us they had contributed anonymously. But some brave souls felt so strongly about showing their support for the political reporter they’ve put their names to their donations. On The Project my rage bubbled to the surface. That’s what happens when women are no longer willing to make nice ⁦@AmyRemeikis⁩ https://t.co/dpVGQrKCpQ A senior Ten reporter, Lachlan Kennedy, chucked in $100, as did the Studio 10 host Narelda Jacobs. Ten is yet to file its defence. The ABC News Breakfast co-host Michael Rowland has announced that the program will be a “Scomo” and “Albo”-free zone this election period. Our very own @BreakfastNews election year pledge:We promise to be a 'Scomo' & 'Albo'-free zone. Nicknames for political leaders have no place on our show. Someone has to maintain standards.And pollies using nicknames for us face the instant dump button!Thank you.😀 #auspol Viewers had some other requests: asking if ABC presenters could stop referring to Karvelas as “PK” and Andrew Probyn as “Probes”. They also asked if the Murdoch papers could be dropped from the media wrap of the day. There aren’t many journalists who would welcome a personal gift from a world leader, never mind publicising the largesse. But Sharri Markson was so “deeply honoured” to receive flowers and a “generous personal letter” from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, she shared it with her followers on Twitter. Thank you enormously @PMOIndia @narendramodi.I’m deeply honoured to receive your generous personal letter and flowers on India’s Republic Day in recognition of my reporting on the origins of Covid-19. @HCICanberra @cgisydney @MEAIndia #whatreallyhappenedinwuhan pic.twitter.com/fRb57ggXRP In her book What Really Happened in Wuhan, and on Sky News Australia and in the Australian, Markson argued that a Wuhan Institute of Virology staffer could have been accidentally infected with Covid-19 and carried it outside. She also raised the possibility that the institute’s research is not just to “stay ahead” of possible future pandemics but to engineer viruses as potential bioweapons. Markson’s reporting on Covid’s origins got particular traction in India, where the bioweapon theory was a defence against the government’s mishandling of the country’s collapsing health system. The Sunrise co-host David Koch was excited when he introduced Andrew Whitehouse, a professor of autism research, to discuss a “fascinating” new study which drew “a link between baby boys exposed to screen time and a greater risk of being diagnosed with autism”. Kochie told viewers that 84,000 toddlers had been monitored over three years to find that “one-year-old boys who spent more time in front of a screen were more likely to be diagnosed with the disorder”. “Andrew, how significant are these findings?” Kochie asked. A new study has found boys who spent more time watching screens at age one were more likely to be on the autism spectrum at age three than other toddlers. pic.twitter.com/M7yBlAIs6F “Look, Kochie, in two words, not very,” Whitehouse said, knocking the wind right out of Kochie’s sails and causing him to pretend to wind up the interview immediately. “It’s really important that we put these kinds of findings in context,” Whitehouse said. “This association doesn’t equal causation here. It could actually be caused by any number of factors and what the study very clearly does not show is a causal link between early screen time and a later diagnosis of autism.” The first Newspoll of 2022 was bad news for the Coalition, showing popular support has slumped to the lowest levels since the 2018 Liberal leadership spill and Morrison’s approval ratings are tumbling. Not that you’d know it if you glanced at the Australian’s pie charts, posted on social media on Monday. Do not buy pie from The Australian pic.twitter.com/I3IYySPkCi The Australian’s graphic did not represent the pie pieces as the numbers had indicated, resulting in Morrison’s and the Coalition’s support looking more significant than it was. While conspiracy theories abounded that the Oz had tried to make Albanese’s support look smaller, the explanation is likely to be more mundane. The pie chart graphic used by the Oz has stayed largely the same for months so some genius just changed the numbers without adjusting the size of the slices, distorting the proportions. The Australian was quick to delete the posts. When KIIS FM newsreader Brooklyn Ross led the bulletin on The Kyle and Jackie O Show with the story about Scott Morrison being called a “horrible person” by colleagues, it infuriated co-host Kyle Sandilands who believed it was “not real news”. Kyle launched a 12-minute expletive-laden rant at the newsreader and his co-host, after which he stormed out, leaving Jackie to present the show solo for the rest of the morning. Now, it may just have been another FM radio stunt to gain attention – drama, bad language and high jinx are common – but the language the popular host used may have been blue enough to attract the attention of the media watchdog. “Actually, I’m a little bit annoyed,” he said just after at 6am on Wednesday. “This is the biggest news in Australia, and it’s all over nothing. “This is not real news. If this is the news just go on the TV and radio today and say ‘no news is good news’. Don’t make up fictitious bullshit drama over nothing.” When Jackie and Brooklyn argued that it was newsworthy, Sandilands labelled her an idiot and told the newsreader his career was “over”. “We don’t have to run around every time some cocksucker from the ABC asks a question,” Kyle said, apparently missing the fact it was Ten’s Van Onselen who asked the question.“Fuck this joint,” he said. “Do the show by yourself. What a fucking show it will be.” If listeners complain to the station and are unhappy with the response, the Australian Communications and Media Authority will investigate, a spokesperson said. While the $100m media mogul has apologised he maintains he has every right to “decide what the news is”. “Well, every right, because I run the show,” Sandilands said. “I’m not an employee ... I don’t work for anyone.”",News/Media,"Why PK dumped PVO, ABC banned ‘Scomo’ and Kyle left Jackie saying ‘oh’ | Weekly Beast",https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/why-pk-dumped-pvo-abc-banned-scomo-and-kyle-left-jackie-saying-oh
