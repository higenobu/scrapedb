4/29/2022,"The deadline for submitting Scottish census returns has been extended by a month after a record number of householders failed to complete their forms or delayed sending them in. Angus Robertson, the Scottish constitution secretary, faced opposition accusations he had presided over a “disastrous” process after he told MSPs on Thursday nearly a quarter of householders had not yet submitted returns, with the original deadline in three days. As a result, National Records of Scotland, the official data agency, had extended the deadline from Sunday 1 May by four weeks to give householders more time to complete returns. Robertson said roughly 600,000 homes, 23% of the total, had not filed theirs as of Thursday morning, despite being sent multiple notices and reminders warning they faced £1,000 fines for failing to do so. Ministers had also offered NRS nearly £10m more to cover their extra costs. For the first time, the agency prioritised online census returns, as was the case in the rest of the UK last year, with 10% of respondents getting paper copies on request, Robertson said. Roughly 68,000 people had left online returns incomplete and a similar number had failed to send in their paper forms. Clearly frustrated at the high rates of abstention, Robertson showed MSPs a thick sheaf of different letters and cards some homes had been getting, which he counted out as he spoke. He said there had also been nearly 1m home visits by census staff. “There are potentially serious consequences for not completing a census,” he said. “[There] has been a lot of public information. The question is why people have not responded in the way one might have hoped and expected they would do so.” Donald Cameron, speaking for the Scottish Conservatives, said this low take-up “has been nothing short of disastrous”. It would set back improvements to public services, and greatly increase census costs, which had already grown by £30m. He said the Scottish government had been urged by the Tories to hold Scotland’s census at the same time as in the rest of the UK, where it was conducted a year ago. That would have meant Scotland would have benefited from UK-wide publicity that it was taking place, Cameron said. Scottish ministers said the Covid crisis meant a delay was necessary; Robertson told Cameron that remained his government’s position. On Monday NRS revealed that 700,000 homes were yet to submit returns, and published data showing return rates were often at their lowest in Scotland’s poorest council areas. It said Glasgow, a city that has Scotland’s highest rate of digital exclusion, had a response rate of 65% and Inverclyde, which also has high poverty rates, was 70%. Wealthier areas such as Aberdeenshire and East Renfrewshire were above 80%. England’s census had a 97% return rate last year, although the deadline was pushed back for some institution settings. Office for National Statistics data showed England’s highest rates of return for digital forms were from its poorest and most ethnically diverse council areas: Tower Hamlets and Newham in London both had a 97% online reply rate. NRS confirmed that for the 2011 census, which was done on paper and did not involve any deadline extensions, the return rate was 94% and in 2001 was 96%. In 2011, only three people were charged for failing to submit a return.",News/UK news,Scottish census deadline extended due to high abstention rate,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/28/scottish-census-deadline-extended-due-to-lack-of-responses
4/29/2022,"The president of the Gabonese Football Federation (Fegafoot) has been charged in connection with the investigation into allegations of widespread sexual abuse in the country. Pierre-Alain Mounguengui, re-elected as Fegafoot’s president for a third term on 16 April, was arrested last Thursday after being summoned by Gabon’s general directorate of counter-interference and military security after allegations published by the Guardian this month. After six days in custody, he was placed in pre-trial detention on Wednesday at the central prison in Libreville, a statement from Fegafoot confirmed. A statement issued on Thursday said: “According to his lawyers, the investigating judge in charge of Pierre-Alain Mounguengui’s hearing in the under-age sexual abuse case in Gabonese football which dates back more than 30 years is on an external mission. His fate will be decided in 10 days.” It is understood that Mounguengui could face up to three years in prison if found guilty of charges that relate to not reporting alleged sexual abuse by a number coaches to the authorities. There is no suggestion Mounguengui has been accused of sexual abuse himself. A Fifa spokesperson said: “The independent Fifa ethics committee has taken note of the additional arrests that have taken place recently in Gabon and is continuing to closely monitor the situation, including ongoing criminal investigation being conducted in the country. As mentioned previously, Fifa remains in contact with several stakeholders and is continuing to seek further information on the matter. Since the matter is currently ongoing, please understand that no further comment can be made at this stage.” Fegafoot has been leading the investigation into allegations of widespread sexual abuse in Gabonese football since allegations were first made last December. Last month the international players’ union, Fifpro, expressed “deep concerns” over Fegafoot’s suitability to handle the case after hearing testimonies that it said detailed “a series of high-profile and serial abusers, who are deeply embedded in Gabonese footballing structures”. In light of Mounguengui’s arrest, it is understood that Fifa’s ethics committee is expected to take over the investigation. Jérôme Efong Nzolo has lodged an appeal with Fegafoot after losing the election to Mounguengui, who he has accused of “flagrant irregularities likely to call into question the final result”.",Sport/Football,Gabonese FA president charged in connection with investigation into alleged sexual abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/gabonese-fa-president-charged-in-connection-with-investigation-into-alleged-sexual-abuse

His day job was as a technical producer for GDS, a virtual executive events provider in Bristol, having graduated with a degree in sound and music for games from dBs Institute in the city last year. For his many personal projects he used the alias BÆRFÜT. The music he wrote, recorded and produced is on mainstream music platforms such as Soundcloud, Spotify and Bandcamp under this name. His tracks Sol and Luna were featured on the BBC radio show Introducing in the West. In addition, he created a mobile gaming app, Ball Drop Down, and a 2D exploration game of crafting, magic and combat called In Phrygia. He also made an audio overdrive plug-in, Buzzsaw, to use in any digital audio workstation, which we hope to make available in the future. Fin was born in Bath, to me, Sarah (nee Usher), a library assistant, and Dylan Scholefield, a bathroom designer and builder, and spent his early years in Bristol.

4/29/2022,"A woman has gone on trial accused of murdering the baby boy she and her husband were planning to adopt. Leiland-James Corkill was 13 months old and in the care of Laura Castle and her husband, Scott, when he died at their home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The couple deny mistreating Leiland-James from 21 August 2020, the day he moved in with them, until he was taken to hospital with head injuries on 6 January 2021. He died the next day. A jury at Preston crown court were read text messages between the couple, apparently regretting the adoption a month after his arrival. “He’s an absolute moaning winge bag and I totally regret doin this. I‘m goin to lose my mind,” Laura, 38, messaged Scott, on 23 September. She added: “I need to stop smacking him cos if I start I’ll not stop at one point and it’s not getting us anywhere and then I feel bad.” Scott, 34, replied to call the 13-month old “a dick baby”. Scott, who worked at BAE Systems in Barrow, denies causing or allowing Leiland-James’s death. Laura has pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denies murder. She said the little boy fell from the sofa. But a pathologist concluded that Leiland-James had suffered a non-accidental, traumatic head injury, which could have occurred by someone shaking him forcefully. Opening the case on Thursday, the prosecution barrister, Michael Brady, QC, said Leiland-James was a “robust and resilient child” who had been taken into care at his birth on 21 December 2019. He initially lived with foster carers until the Castles were approved as potential adopters, with Leiland-James formally “handed over” to the couple on 22 August for a trial period. Laura subsequently told a social worker that she did not love Leiland-James, the jury heard. She said she was struggling to bond with him and that she and her husband felt as though they were “babysitting” him. But unbeknown to social services, the court heard, she was assaulting the little boy within five weeks of his arrival. “I’ve just absolutely leathered him, I can[’t] take this any more, he’s gonna have to go,” Laura told Scott in a text on 24 September. Scott replied to say: “Your not an abusive parent baby. Not at all. Don’t say that. I think he’s a little too fucked up for us to handle xc. “Let’s just call it quits. I don’t want you to have a mental break down. Your more important to me than him.” A month before Leiland-James died, Cumbria county council’s adoption panel agreed not to recommend an adoption “given the issues with attachment”, Brady told the court. The couple were told they would not be able permanently to adopt Leiland-James “until further therapeutic work had been done”. The night before Leiland-James died, Scott sent a text to Laura suggesting the little boy might benefit from “a good hard smack”. Brady told the jury: “It is the crown’s case that set against a background of frustration, born out of highly stressful domestic circumstances, including financial difficulties and an inability to bond with Leiland-James, Laura Castle’s frustration with Leiland-James turned to hostility, as evidenced by her physical abuse of him culminating in his murder.” The case continues.",News/UK news,Woman goes on trial for murder of toddler she was trying to adopt,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/28/woman-goes-on-trial-for-of-toddler-she-was-trying-to-adopt
4/29/2022,"When it comes to the Pumas UNAM, the only certainty is uncertainty. In that sense, Wednesday night’s first-leg of the Concacaf Champions League final lived up to its billing in a match filled with surprises, twists and VAR-filled drama. By the time the final whistle blew, the Pumas had thrown away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw that felt like a loss for a team who departed the Estadio Olímpico Universitario wondering what could have been. In contrast, Seattle head home for the second leg upbeat after escaping what had looked like a heavy defeat. Drama peppered the match: four VAR reviews, and the same number of penalties, the last of which was scored in the ninth minute of added time by Nicolás Lodeiro to give the Sounders a crucial draw. #SCCL22 | 🏆📹 | RESUMEN DEL PARTIDO 👀@SoundersFC consiguió el empate frente a @PumasMX al final del juego.Par de goles de Juan Dinenno ⚽️⚽️ y Nicolás Lodeiro ⚽️⚽️ pic.twitter.com/0f0qMiiCVE Considering that the match was played in front of a raucous crowd, Seattle’s comeback was no minor feat. The Seattle Times dubbed the draw as “stunning”, while Mexico City’s Record, bemoaned the fact that the Pumas “let the triumph escape.” Another Mexican sports daily, Esto, posed the question: “Goodbye to the glory?” Tournament “glory” and overachievement has long been an apt description for the Pumas, a club typified by low-budget payrolls and promising young players, along with subpar regular season performances that are often coupled with jaw-dropping post-season upsets and comebacks. Just last month in the Concacaf Champions League quarter-finals, the Pumas came back from a 3-0 deficit against the New England Revolution to force a penalty shootout, which they duly won. On Wednesday, though, it was the Pumas were on the wrong end of a dramatic comeback. Previewing the match, former USA international Herculez Gomez said the Pumas would “rather be an underdog”. That was not the case against the Sounders, and the Pumas were leading 2-0 as the match entered the final stages. The Pumas looked uncomfortable in the driver’s seat and it was the Sounders who summoned the underdog spirit in front of a hostile crowd, which acted as a 12th man and helped spur their team to an early lead, as the rain drove down in Mexico City. The home fans tossed beer and yelled expletives in unison at any significant call that went against them. In the 77th minute, the Sounders forced a handball and Lodeiro cooly converted the first of his two successful penalties of the night. He was the right man for the job: he has converted 92% of his penalties over his career (in comparison Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo’s conversion rates are 77% and 83% respectively). The comeback was not a complete surprise. Seattle’s coach, Brian Schmetzer, was upbeat after the match and proudly pointed to Seattle’s “never quit” culture. And his team have a history of comebacks to rival the Pumas: in the 2020 MLS Western Conference final they overturned a 2-0 deficit to beat Minnesota United 3-2 in a match that Schmetzer dubbed “one of the best [Sounders] games ever”. Schmetzer lauded Lodeiro’s “mental toughness” as a counter-example to those who believed his team were intimidated by the atmosphere inside Estadio Olímpico Universitario. And now the Pumas are the ones who have a hostile crowd to face at Seattle’s Lumen Field, where the Sounders have drawn crowds close to 70,000 for big games. They’ll also be conscious of the fact that they have an unimpressive record against MLS clubs north of the border (three wins, two draws and five losses). The Pumas may well relish reverting to their familiar status as underdogs and will draw comfort from the fact that they have the tournament’s leading scorer, Argentina’s Juan Ignacio Dinenno. He scored both of his team’s goals on Wednesday, including the only non-penalty goal of the night, a very impressive header off a perfect cross from Jesus Rivas. Seattle also have a poor record against Liga MX teams (seven wins, three draws and nine losses) and are trying to become the first MLS team to win the tournament in two decades. However, they will have a slight mental advantage as hosts in the second leg, particularly after their comeback in Mexico City. Regardless of the outcome of the second leg, one of these teams will make their debut at the Club World Cup. The Seattle Sounders official Twitter page addressed the high stakes involved with the following statement: “CCL Final: It’ s A Big F’ing Deal.” It certainly will be and, inevitably, history will be made.",Sport/Football,Sounders play comeback kings Pumas at own game in Concacaf Champions League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/sounders-play-comeback-kings-pumas-at-own-game-in-concacaf-champions-league-final
4/29/2022,"Sweden’s prime minister has said the Scandinavian country has failed to integrate many of the immigrants who have settled there over the past 20 years, creating a nation of “parallel societies … living in different realities”. Unveiling a series of measures to tackle organised crime after violent riots over the Easter weekend that left more than 100 police injured, Magdalena Andersson said Islamism and rightwing extremism had been allowed to fester in Sweden. “Segregation has been allowed to go so far that we have parallel societies in Sweden,” the Social Democrat prime minister told a news conference. “We live in the same country but in completely different realities. We will have to reassess our previous truths and make tough decisions.” Integration had been “too poor, at the same time as we have experienced very substantial levels of immigration”, Andersson added. “Society has been too weak, resources for the police and social services have been too weak.” The number of people living in Sweden who were born abroad has doubled over the past 20 years to about 2 million, or one-fifth of the population. Andersson said it was “crucial to prevent more children and young people from being drawn into crime”. She said she aimed to introduce local “youth delinquency boards”, in which social services and police would collaborate closely, in addition to putting in place tools to ensure young people stayed in school and off the streets. The justice and home affairs minister, Morgan Johansson, outlined plans to give the police greater electronic surveillance powers, facilitate the exchange of information between authorities, and deny residence even to people not yet convicted of a crime. “What we saw were no political protests,” Andersson said of the riots. “Police were attacked with stones and molotov cocktails. It was not a political act, it was a criminal act – an attack on the democracy that many have actually fled to.” The riots erupted after a notorious anti-immigrant provocateur, the Danish-Swedish politician Rasmus Paludan, threatened to tour the country burning the Qur’an. Police clashed with groups of mostly masked young men in several towns and cities. Police insisted they had to grant permits for Paludan’s incendiary events, planned mainly in areas with large Muslim populations, because of the country’s liberal freedom of speech laws, but Johansson said those freedoms were being abused by “extremists” to foster “hate, division and violence”. Dozens of people were arrested after three days of rioting in Norrköping, Linköping, Landskrona, Örebro, Malmö and the capital, Stockholm. A school was also set alight and 20 police vehicles either damaged or destroyed. Sweden has radically tightened its immigration policies since taking in more people per capita than any other EU country during the migration crisis of 2015, and now has one of the bloc’s most restrictive policies along with neighbouring Denmark.",News/World news,"Sweden’s failed integration creates ‘parallel societies’, says PM after riots",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/swedens-failed-integration-creates-parallel-societies-says-pm-after-riots
4/29/2022,"The Sun attempted to expose Jimmy Savile as a paedophile while he was still alive – only to have to back down because of Britain’s tough libel laws, according to one of the journalists who investigated the case. Meirion Jones said the tabloid was ready to publish the story in 2008, which could have brought the entertainer to justice while he was still alive. The newspaper’s reporters had signed affidavits from women who had been abused as children by Savile at the notorious Haut de la Garenne children’s home in Jersey. In an article for the Guardian, Jones said the Sun’s journalists and editors were confident in the evidence that Savile had abused individuals on the island. However, the tabloid’s lawyers were worried they would lose any subsequent libel case and be left with a £1m bill – partly because the victims might not be believed in court. Jones said the newspaper knew Savile was highly litigious and if they published a story they “would be facing the best QCs money could buy, representing a man who could potentially call Prince Charles, Margaret Thatcher, the heads of charities, the head of the BBC and the pope as character witnesses”. The journalist, who features in a recent Netflix documentary about Savile, said: “The best guess of the lawyers was that a libel action could cost a million pounds and the Sun would definitely lose. The story was canned and the journalists and editors were furious. But this wasn’t the first or last time that Savile escaped because of our libel laws, which rewarded his deliberate targeting of vulnerable victims.” Instead, the Sun published a carefully worded article about child abuse at the Jersey care home, along with a picture of Savile on the premises – while repeatedly emphasising that the BBC presenter had no knowledge of what happened there. Despite this, Savile’s lawyers still threatened legal action when the Sun published a picture of Savile with children at the care home. A copy of the legal threat sent to the Sun in 2008, seen by the Guardian, was sent on behalf of Savile by Fox Hayes Solicitors, a Leeds business which is now defunct. Emphasising the “huge sums” that Savile’s charity work had raised for children, the lawyers demanded the Sun issue a prominent statement “making clear that any visit to the home was entirely innocent”, delete the article from its website, and pay Savile compensation “for the injury to his feelings and reputation”. The legal firm said child abuse was the “antithesis of everything he [Savile] has worked tirelessly to prevent”. They insisted the entertainer did not remember visiting children at the care home in the 1970s but “any such visit would have been unexceptional save for the pleasure it may have given”. After Savile’s death in 2011, hundreds of his victims came forward. The public eventually learned that one of Britain’s most famous light entertainment stars was also one of the country’s most prolific paedophiles. Jones, now editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, helped to tell the victims’ stories – but only after BBC bosses blocked his initial investigation from appearing on Newsnight in one of the corporation’s worst scandals. He is now urging the government to reform Britain’s libel laws to make it easier for investigative stories to be published, warning they have been used by people ranging from Savile to major corporations and Russian oligarchs to avoid scrutiny. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is currently overseeing a review of the relevant legislation. A spokesperson for the Sun declined to comment.",News/UK news,"Jimmy Savile escaped justice because of libel laws, claims reporter ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/28/jimmy-savile-escaped-justice-because-of-libel-laws-claims-reporter
4/29/2022,"Anyone who has watched the new Netflix film Jimmy Savile: a British Horror Story will be asking how Savile got away with abusing children for decades – and why he wasn’t exposed earlier. As someone who spent years trying to expose him myself, I believe there are four key reasons. First, institutions turned a blind eye because Savile was worth more to them than the victims were. Second, he built connections with the most powerful people in the country – the prime minister Margaret Thatcher and Prince Charles – which gave him protection. Third, he targeted vulnerable victims whose testimony would not stand up in court. But the last reason – and the least discussed – is the way that our arcane libel laws protect the wicked. Ever since the first high-profile libel case, when the most famous pirate in history – Captain Morgan – won £200 in damages (£40,000 today) in the 17th century for being accused of being a cruel buccaneer, our defamation laws have protected wrongdoers. I can reveal that in 2008 the Sun was about to blow the whistle on Savile. They had affidavits from women who had been abused as children by him at the notorious Haut de la Garenne children’s home, which was at the centre of the Jersey child abuse scandal. The journalists and the editors were confident in their evidence. Then came the moment that the story had to be got through the in-house lawyers. We can imagine the conversations. Who are our witnesses who will give evidence if Savile sues us for libel? They were children at the time – can we trust their memories? Some of them might have had criminal records or been involved with drugs. Remember, Savile deliberately targeted institutions where his victims might not be believed in court. They would be facing the best QCs money could buy, representing a man who could potentially call Prince Charles, Margaret Thatcher, the heads of charities, the head of the BBC and the pope as character witnesses. The best guess of the lawyers was that a libel action could cost a million pounds and the Sun would definitely lose. The story was canned and the journalists and story’s editors were furious. But this wasn’t the first or last time that Savile escaped because of our libel laws, which rewarded his deliberate targeting of vulnerable victims. Off the record, journalists have told me of multiple attempts to blow the whistle on Savile from the 1960s onwards that failed because newspapers could not afford the legal risks involved. Brian Hitchen, who was the editor of the Daily Star and the Sunday Express in the late 1980s and early 1990s, said he knew Savile was a paedophile at the time but thought the combination of his celebrity and our libel laws would make it impossible to publish the story. In 1994 the Sunday Mirror tried to get the Savile story out. The editor, Paul Connew, was convinced but he knew that Savile would win if it came to court. Part of the calculation may have been that Savile would be represented by the fearsome QC George Carman. In the end, the Sun in 2008 published a picture of Savile at Haut de la Garenne with a group of young children. “Sir Jimmy had no idea of the horrors at the orphanage,” the copy read, but it was obvious to me at the time what the Sun wanted to reveal but was unable to publish. The photo became part of our evidence file at Newsnight in 2011 as the reporter Liz MacKean, researcher Hannah Livingston and myself started to piece together the evidence that Savile had abused children, not just at Duncroft (the school my aunt ran) but at every institution he was associated with, from Stoke Mandeville to the BBC, and Broadmoor to Haut de la Garenne. Even the mild version of the story and the follow-ups that were published by the Sun caused Savile’s lawyers to write to the publication. “We act for Sir James Savile and have been consulted in relation to the above articles,” the letter read. “As your publication will know our client has tirelessly campaigned for underprivileged and sick children. His charity work over many years has raised huge sums which have benefited many projects and hospitals … Linking our client to events at the home has caused untold embarrassment and upset.” As ever, Savile was trumpeting his knighthood, and therefore powerful connections, and hiding behind his charity fundraising and work with children. His lawyers demanded the Sun take down the articles, pay compensation for “the injury to his feelings and reputation”, and, of course, his legal costs. Above all, this should all be confidential. To their credit, at least one Sun journalist continued pursuing Savile, but without success. If the media found itself in the same position now, with a prolific offender with powerful friends, ample resources and vulnerable victims, I suspect the legal advice would be the same: don’t publish. Every investigative journalist can tell you about the ones that got away – the outright villains who escaped because the legal risks were too high. But there is a chance to reset this. Our libel laws have come under scrutiny again after a succession of cases brought by oligarchs and big companies trying to limit journalists’ reporting. The Russian state energy company Rosneft and billionaires Roman Abramovich and Mikhail Fridman sued Catherine Belton for libel for her book Putin’s People, running up £1.5m in legal costs for her publishers (the claim was eventually settled, with several changes made to the book). Last month the high court threw out a longrunning claim by the controversial Kazakh mining corporation ENRC against the Financial Times and its journalist Tom Burgis. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the government is moving to rein in our libel courts. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is now consulting on changes to the 2013 Defamation Act to make it more difficult for powerful individuals and organisations to use the courts to harass journalists and prevent them telling the truth about their wrongdoing. The government is considering a number of measures to discourage what are known as strategic litigation against public participation suits, or Slapps. The law firms play an important role in protecting evildoers in Britain. As the MP Bob Seely said in the Commons: “Oligarchs, Putin’s henchmen, team up with amoral lawyers.” The libel specialists sometimes make the argument that it is like the right to counsel in a criminal trial – that, no matter how bad the allegations are, the individual needs to be defended – but there is no legal basis for this. At best they seem unconcerned about whether the allegations are true. After Connew had to pull the paedophile allegations against Savile he talked to Carman, who told him: “I suspect you’re right.” Carman had previously succeeded in destroying a criminal child abuse case against another celebrity who later had to admit he was guilty. One of the ideas is to strengthen the public interest defence in clause 4 of the act – this is crucial. It is difficult to think of anything that is more in the public interest than exposing an individual who is a prolific abuser of children. We must make sure that any changes made to the act help journalists expose wrongdoing, whether it is by oligarchs or prolific paedophiles, or other offenders. In the Netflix documentary, Andrew Neil says, “As a profession, as journalists, we failed the country. We should have got this guy.” It is right that we should beat ourselves up – but the UK’s restrictive defamation litigation is a key part of that failure. Savile would have been exposed decades earlier – dozens would not have been raped, hundreds would not have been assaulted – were it not for our insane libel laws. At the Bureau of Investigative Journalism I receive dozens of letters from legal firms defending the indefensible, making false claims and threatening legal action. Recently one of the prominent firms sent a letter to a newspaper that was co-publishing a story with us. The letter was wrong about what had happened in court – even though it was a matter of public record. It arrived on deadline and the paper had no time to think and pulled the key allegation from the story. The House of Lords is pressing the Solicitors Regulation Authority to clamp down on law firms representing oligarchs. It needs to go wider than that. A culture has grown up in which it is normal for some lawyers engaged in “reputation management” to knowingly lie on behalf of their clients in an attempt to shield them from damaging revelations by journalists. This should not be acceptable to the regulator. So, the British horror story of Savile should feed into the discussion launched by Slapps into a rebalancing of the law in favour of public interest journalism – rather than enabling powerful individuals and corporations to evade justice.
