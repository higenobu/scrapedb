4/13/2022,"Ukrainian authorities have collected 765 bodies of civilians, including 30 children, in the Kyiv area since Russian forces were routed there at the start of April, a senior prosecutor in the region has said. Oleh Tkalenko, the Kyiv region deputy head prosecutor, warned that authorities expected many more dead bodies would be found in the coming weeks. “This is only the beginning. We have only just started working in the bigger towns such as Borodianka, Hostomel, Irpin and Bucha,” Tkalenko said, referring to the number of dead civilians. “There’s a lot we haven’t dug up yet.” Several mass graves have been discovered since Ukrainian authorities regained control of swathes of the Kyiv region that had been under Russian occupation. “Documenting each individual correctly takes time and effort,” said Tkalenko. “But we need to do this so that we have the evidence so that there won’t be any tales about it being a fake.” “I believe that [Russian soldiers] deliberately left the bodies of citizens they killed on the streets and prohibited people from burying them in order to intimidate the population,” Tkalenko said. He also described three cases of alleged torture against groups of civilians in the region, which his office is investigating. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and has said that Ukrainian and western allegations of war crimes are concocted. Tkalenko claimed that in the town of Motyzhyn, Russian soldiers picked out nine people who they believed had helped the Ukrainian army. Six people were tortured to death and three survived, he said. “They were stripped naked, put in pits, beaten. They were shot in the legs, arms, and tortured,” Tkalenko said. “They starved them.” Tkalenko said they had begun work on a larger case allegedly involving more than 40 people in the village of Dymer, north of Kyiv. “They were used as forced labourers. They made them dig their own graves and broke their fingers,” Tkalenko said. “They shot near their heads and between their legs. Those who refused to speak, or if they did not like what they were saying, were shot in the arm.” “They were strangled, their arms were twisted,” Tkalenko said. The third case, still under investigation, took place on the territory of a golf club near the town of Makariv. Russian forces were using the golf club as their headquarters and detained a group of local residents. “They were buried alive, forced to dig a grave, beaten,” Tkalenko said. Tkalenko declined to give exact figures on the instances of sexual violence or rape that they have documented. According to him, the number of rape cases opened by prosecutors in the Kyiv region is in the tens. He stressed, however, that women were reluctant to file police reports if they had suffered acts of sexual violence because they believed the perpetrators would not be caught. Instead, they were contacting psychologists and doctors for help. “People are ashamed to talk about rape,” said Tkalenko. “We are approaching individuals and talking to them one by one. “People are more ready to talk about torture cases.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Tuesday that the number of rape cases is in the hundreds. A spokesperson for Zelenskiy’s office declined to give an exact figure or further details about where the alleged crimes had taken place and against whom. The general prosecutor’s office could not be reached for comment on the exact number of cases. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Lyudmila Denisova, stated on 8 April that 25 women were kept in a basement in a house in Bucha and systemically raped. “It’s hard to talk about what goes on in their head,” said Tkalenko about the psychology of Russian troops. “But I would say that the Russian army is made up of people who couldn’t afford the bribe to get out of conscription.” “They even stole people’s boilers,” said Tkalenko.",News/World news,"Bodies of 765 civilians recovered so far in Kyiv region, says prosecutor",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/bodies-of-765-civilians-recovered-so-far-in-kyiv-region-says-prosecutor
4/13/2022,"Patricia Scotland’s hopes of being re-elected Commonwealth secretary general have been dealt a blow after Jamaica’s foreign minister, Kamina Johnson-Smith, announced she is challenging Scotland for the post. The decision has sparked controversy within the Caribbean, which had previously met to back Scotland’s bid for a second term. The Antiguan prime minister Gaston Browne has described Jamaica’s decision to break ranks as a “monumental error”. “Jamaica was party to a recent Caribbean Community (Caricom) consensus endorsing the re-election of Baroness Scotland,” he said. “I think Jamaica’s proposed candidature for Commonwealth secretary general is a monumental error, which could only serve to divide the Caribbean.” He said the Dominican-born Scotland was being hounded out of office by a group that “have now skilfully engineered a plan to divide Caricom and to stain the performance of the region”. He warned that the machiavellian tactics may only serve “as a gateway for a non-Caricom secretary general to succeed”. In a bid to heal the rift, it has now been agreed that a Caricom sub-group will interview the two candidates in a bid to reach a consensus, according to St Vincent and the Grenadines prime minister Ralph Gonsalves. The sub-group consists of the Bahamas, Belize, Dominica, Guyana, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Jamaica. It has been the convention that a secretary general is not contested if he or she seeks a second four-year term. The 15-member Caricom had given overwhelming support for Scotland when they met in Belize in March, but that phrasing may have disguised the objections of a minority. Either way, the Jamaican decision on 1 April to announce Johnson-Smith’s candidacy caught most observers by surprise. One former Jamaican foreign minister, Delano Franklyn, noted his country’s surprise move came after the visit to Jamaica by Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, and that visit may have been used as a backchannel to lobby the Jamaican government. He asserted: “As chairman of the Commonwealth, prime minister Boris Johnson is doing everything to ensure that he has a secretary general of the Commonwealth who will fall in line with the thinking of British conservative politics.” The UK, however, insists it is staying neutral, but supporters of Scotland believe Foreign Office officials have been manoeuvring for years to remove her on the basis it believed she has awarded contracts improperly and proved a poor administrator. Certainly someone is going to great lengths to block Scotland’s second term. A previous potential challenger, Monica Juma, the Kenyan energy minister and a former diplomat, had announced in August 2021 that she was to stand against Scotland, received Britain’s endorsement and started campaigning. However, she then mysteriously pulled out, leaving Scotland’s opponents without a challenger. Juma had been endorsed for the top job by President Uhuru Kenyatta last year, who called her “an exemplar of what we in the Commonwealth hold”. The 19 African members of the Commonwealth had only recently, through the African Union, endorsed Juma’s bid, but she clearly could not gain traction in the Caribbean. In a brochure she released in September, Juma said she wanted to change the perception of the Commonwealth as an organisation of the past. It appears Juma was not receiving sufficient support across the 54-member Commonwealth and it was agreed that she stood down to find a candidate more likely to defeat Scotland. The Commonwealth summit is supposed to reach a decision by consensus and the royal family will not want an unedifying row at what may be one of the Queen’s last summits. Judging by her recent public appearances, she is unlikely to attend in person. Jamaica’s decision to put up a candidate has its ironies since the country had previously hinted that it is considering quitting the Commonwealth or removing the Queen as head of state. However, its prime minister, Andrew Holness, in announcing Johnson-Smith’s candidacy, praised her qualifications for the post of secretary general, including her high moral character, diplomatic and political acumen, proven competence and commitment to the work of the Commonwealth. “She will bring a wealth of experience to the position and is committed to international public service,” he said. Johnson-Smith, foreign minister since 2020 and a former barrister, said on Twitter: “It would be an absolute privilege to serve this great family of nations.” President Paul Kagame of Rwanda was due in Jamaica this week, where the post of secretary general is bound to be discussed. The delayed Commonwealth heads of government meeting was initially due to be held in 2020, but that has twice been postponed due to Covid, meaning Scotland’s term has already been extended. Scotland, a former Labour frontbench politician and member of the House of Lords, has been dogged by stories in the UK accusing her of a misuse of funds, including an internal auditor’s report that suggested normal procedures had not been followed in the award of a management consultancy contract to a fellow Labour peer. She has always denied any wrongdoing.",News/World news,Jamaica to challenge commonwealth secretary-general’s re-election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/jamaica-challenge-commonwealth-secretary-general-re-election
4/13/2022,"Twenty-five scientists have pasted pages of scientific papers to the windows of the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, and glued their hands to the glass, to highlight the climate science they say the government is ignoring. The scientists, affiliated with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion, swooped on the department’s building at 1 Victoria Street, Westminster, just after 11am. Doctors and health professionals staged a decoy action to give them space to get into position. The action came a week after the government published a new energy strategy which vowed to continue the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas, failed to set targets for onshore wind, and gave nuclear a central role. Ecologist Dr Aaron Thierry, 36, who had his hand glued to the window of BEIS, said: “I really wish I was not here, but also I’m really glad that I’m here with all these scientists who know what’s right. “The government’s insane, and I don’t know what to do, other than to do this, to try and get the attention that we need to wake the public up.”Ecologist Dr Aaron Thierry (@ThierryAaron), who has his hand superglued to the window at @beisgovuk with @ScientistsX pic.twitter.com/Hx8oAvZZgC “Last week the world’s scientists released a report that sounded the final alarm for the planet. It said we must end our addiction to fossil fuels now. The UK government’s response a few days later was to announce it will increase its exploration for oil and gas with the intention of extracting every last drop. “Science tells us that this approach will condemn our civilisations to destruction. We will not stand by and let this happen. Scientists have been sounding the alarm for decades but have been ignored by governments.” Richard Ecclestone, a former inspector with Devon and Cornwall police who was acting as legal observer of the protest for XR, said the scientists had decided on the action in the wake of the energy strategy. “They put this action together to draw the attention of the department for business, to remind them of what the science is,” he said. “They’ve taken quotes from recent scientific reports saying basically there’s irrefutable evidence now that we cannot continue to search for and exploit oil and gas reserves, or that will mean death.” Dr Charlie Gardner, 43, a conservation scientist and associate senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: “At both the domestic and international policy level there are very powerful actors who don’t want our society to decarbonise. “There are people who who are very wealthy and powerful from the way that the world is set up now and they don’t want that to change, they don’t want to decarbonise because that will limit their opportunity to generate money from fossil fuels. “As a result we have government departments making decisions that will lead us to calamity, and as a scientist I know what impacts this has, I can see that coming, and I can’t be passive, I can’t just let that happen. I need to act.” The Guardian has contacted BEIS for comment. The scientists’ protest was part of a week of civil disobedience by XR in London. The environmental protest group, which called on supporters to take a week off work to take part, began its “rebellion” on Saturday with blockades in the West End, and on Sunday supporters blocked bridges over the Thames. Supporters of the group were assembling at Hyde Park on Wednesday morning. More protests were expected.",News/Environment,XR scientists glue hands to business department in London climate protest,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/xr-scientists-glue-hands-to-business-department-in-london-climate-protest
4/13/2022,"Far away, at the other end of the pitch, a Ukrainian footballer is scoring what later turns out to have been a beautifully worked goal. That is something remarkable in itself but Oksana is talking and the backdrop has become a detail. She is thinking about the train she will board in around nine hours; it will return her to Kyiv, at last, and from there she will join the volunteer effort in Bucha. The home she left is 10 miles further south, in Boyarka. Like most of the capital’s satellite towns, it has undergone its own visit to hell. “Tomorrow they are burying one more of my friends, but I won’t make it in time,” she says. “Many have gone already and I have no idea whether I will ever see many more of them again. Two close friends were killed while they were helping to evacuate people. They were found in a mass grave with evidence that they were tortured. And I know that there is more of this to come.” Oksana’s story drowns out the clamour of a football game. It is delivered matter-of-factly and with what she describes as a necessary distance. “My mind is just trying to reject the reality,” she says. “I just disconnect my feelings. It’s going to come later, I’m aware.” She has wrapped herself in a Ukraine flag and is far from alone in that. At a safe estimate about two-thirds of an 18,000 crowd inside Legia Warsaw’s stadium are her compatriots. Some live here; many have arrived through necessity. All of them are processing, or will one day be faced with handling, grief that is at once collective and intensely personal. They are nominally here to watch Dynamo Kyiv play the host club in the first of a “match for peace” series that will raise money for the response to Russia’s invasion and see them face several other European teams. To some, immersion in a match represents welcome diversion; to others it is simply the first opportunity to be together in numbers like this. “Maybe not everybody would understand this kind of event but it helps to raise the feeling of belonging to the Ukrainian nation,” says Oksana, who left Boyarka for Warsaw with her children after the war began but has made regular journeys to and from Lviv with supplies for soldiers and medics. “We are fighting a war between light and darkness, and light will succeed.” It is a yellow and blue collage of thoughts and feelings. Two hours before kick-off Mykola, a Dynamo fan, is standing by a railing at the ground’s north-eastern corner. He is 21 and has been in Warsaw since moving from the central Ukrainian region Kirovhrad, currently working as a barman. As people pass, he helps to staff a makeshift stall accepting donations that will go towards bulletproof vests, helmets and other protective equipment for those defending Ukraine. A similar collection in Warsaw’s old town raised 8,000 zloty (£1,450); that tally will be comfortably exceeded this evening. His father is with him, handing out bread with sliced pork and pickles to everyone who contributes, but he thinks about his grandparents back home. “It’s an emotional feeling to be here,” he says. “The message Dynamo are sending is important: stop the war, win it and return to peace. That is all we want. This match can help us.” Outside the stand Katya is with her sister Nastya and brother-in-law Ihor, who have lived in Warsaw for five years. Ihor is a self-confessed Dynamo fanatic and holds a scarf aloft. Katya studies in Kyiv but left early in March to join them, at her family’s insistence. “I feel safe in Warsaw but can’t say I am calm,” she says. “I worry about my parents; it tears me apart. Every night, in my dreams, I just see bombs and people dying.” Further along, Yulia is pacing up and down a swelling crowd with a clipboard. Every few seconds someone presents her with their blue Ukrainian passport and has their name ticked off a list of participants in a pre-match concert. The vast majority of refugees in Poland are women and children, because most men under 60 are required to stay in Ukraine. Nowadays they are mainly from the country’s east and arrive at Warsaw’s central station, where two tents offering food and other assistance greet them. Yulia, a refugee and a student producer in Kyiv before the invasion, is gathering about 100 of them to join famous Ukrainian musicians on the pitch. “We set up a Telegram channel to find people who would be interested in coming,” she explains. “It is a way for them to be part of something, and also to help our nation. I’ve been trying to help people with their basic needs since I got here because we all have to be together. But everything is difficult. I feel pain constantly and cry every day.” The participants file inside, walk around the pitch and, half an hour before kick-off, are dancing on a Ukraine-shaped stage in the centre circle alongside musicians such as Kateryna Pavlenko of Go_A, who represented the country at Eurovision in 2020. The moment when the Ukrainian anthem plays, shortly after the teams have walked out, makes the hair stand on end. Dynamo have been staying in the Regent hotel, a pleasant walk away through Lazienki Park. Friends drop by to visit, including fellow footballers; Ihor Litovka, goalkeeper from the top-flight club Desna Chernihiv and now a temporary resident in Warsaw with his wife and new-born baby, catches up with the defender Oleksandr Karavayev. Litovka’s home stadium has been bombed; he dreams of returning to Chernihiv, whose scale of suffering is yet to become fully apparent, after the war to rebuild his club and set up a keepers’ academy. Since leaving Ukraine the Dynamo players have spent 10 days training in Bucharest under the veteran coach Mircea Lucescu, who has spoken passionately about his belief that football can offer empowerment during war. Those players with rooms at the front of the hotel can look out of their windows to see a banner reading “Putin go fuck yourself” in Ukrainian and “Glory to Ukraine” in Polish, hanging from a grey commercial building across the street. When Vitaliy Buyalskiy puts Dynamo ahead against Legia within three minutes, chipping in adeptly, he does so in front of a “Stop the War” banner emblazoned on the lower tier behind the goal. Buyalskiy drops to his knees; there are loud cheers but otherwise the atmosphere takes time to warm up. This is no ordinary football crowd and it is hardly a night for celebrations; a section of Legia’s ultras have decided to boycott the fixture, alleging that Dynamo’s ownership is pro-Russia, which has been denied. Those fans are not around to present the kind of spectacle they did in Poznan on Saturday, when an image of Putin with a noose around his neck was unfurled. This is a more gentle and sensitive affair but, by the second half, chants denouncing the Russian president become audible and a couple of yellow and blue flares are let off. “I’m not a fan of Dynamo, just a fan of Ukraine,” says Bohdan, who arrived in Warsaw from the Luhansk region in 2014 and greets the goals enthusiastically. Legia equalise but Dynamo score again through Artem Besedin and, while Oksana is putting everything in its context, the same player seals the outcome. At full-time “Imagine” is played, the flags wave in unison and Benjamin Verbic, a Slovenian winger who joined Legia on loan from Dynamo after the invasion, is among those who cannot hold back the tears. “We will be dealing with this war for many years,” says Oksana. “But my view, and I don’t think it’s just a romantic one, is that there are much more powerful tools than firing weapons. There is the human face, the brain, the soul and love inside. I think this is what the Ukrainians have and the Russians don’t. We’ve seen it here again tonight. And that’s why we are going to win.”",Sport/Football,‘I cry every day’: in the stands with Ukrainians as Dynamo Kyiv play again,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/in-the-stands-with-ukrainians-dynamo-kyiv-play-again-match-for-peace-russia
4/13/2022,"A state-owned TV station in Shanghai has postponed a show that highlights the positive sides of the city’s response to an Omicron outbreak after an online backlash. Shanghai Dragon Television, the city’s main TV channel that also broadcasts via satellite to Chinese-speaking audiences globally, announced the decision on social media late on Tuesday night, hours after it was criticised online. Dragon TV said it welcomed “valuable feedback to our work”. The pre-recorded show, which would pay tribute to Shanghai’s key workers as well as the government’s leadership, had planned to feature some of China’s best-known celebrities, including Andy Lau and Wang Yibo. It was initially scheduled to be broadcast during prime time on Wednesday evening. Some staff at Dragon TV said the programme’s purpose was to “inject positive energy” into the city’s nearly 26-million residents, who have been in lockdown. But an online backlash ensued soon after the show was announced. “We stay at home, worry about not being able to grab food… we are constantly being consumed every day, and too many negative things are happening. At this moment, we have not succeeded in fighting the epidemic,” said one commenter. They continued: “What is the significance of this special party, is it really for the people, is it really to pay tribute to the medical staff and volunteers? Do something real and I really don’t care about the party. Please pay more attention to public opinion. Solve problems and do real things, don’t engage in such formalism.” Footage of people unable to buy food has spread across China’s social media in the past fortnight as the city entered initially a staggered lockdown, then a full-scale one. Residents have complained about the city’s handling of the outbreak and blamed the authorities for the ill-preparedness. Despite the harsh restrictions, the number of Covid-19 infections has continued to rise in the city. On Wednesday, Shanghai reported a further 25,141 asymptomatic cases for Tuesday, up from 22,348 a day earlier. Symptomatic cases also rose, from 994 to 1,189, the city authorities said. The situation in Shanghai and the spillover effect to nearby cities have worried economists, who say the lockdowns have disrupted the global supply chains. On Wednesday, dozens of producers of key electronic components suspended production at their facilities in Kunshan, which is home to one of the world’s largest electronics manufacturing hubs. Perhaps under pressure from the online backlash, Dragon TV said in a late-night post on Tuesday that it would postpone the broadcast of the programme. Yet despite the last-minute withdrawal, some people were still angry. “Please ask Dragon TV to go live on the streets 24 hours a day: 1) Check who is driving up prices. 2) Track where the aid materials are sent, how much is sent, and to whom? 3) How can the lonely elderly and critically ill patients go out of the community to see a doctor,” one wrote.",News/World news,Shanghai TV channel postpones Covid spin show after backlash ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/shanghai-tv-channel-postpones-covid-spin-show-after-backlash-lockdown-outbreak
4/13/2022,"My father, William Nash, who has died aged 72 of a brain tumour, was a campaigning lawyer who relished a fight with the establishment and broke new ground on human rights. He was one of those who defended the journalist Crispin Aubrey and the former signals officer John Berry during the controversial ABC trial in 1978, where his clients were accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act. The case was a landmark one regarding journalistic freedom and the ability to question the arcane dealings of the security services. During proceedings, the government labelled William a threat to national security and tried to remove him from court. Later in life, William moved to legal aid criminal defence, where he acted to protect rights in an everyday sense – ensuring that everyone, regardless of background, had access to justice. He was a fixture of the courts where his unkempt appearance belied a formidable intellect – even when, as happened twice in his career, he accidentally set himself on fire in court (he had forgotten to put out his pipe). William was born in Aberystwyth, west Wales, to Polly (nee Mitchell), a school teacher, and Eric Nash, a professor at Aberystwyth University. William remained a proud supporter of the Wales rugby team all his life. He was orphaned in his teens and experienced the disdain of his teachers at Haileybury school, Hertfordshire, for his leftwing views. Despite their best efforts, William studied law at Oxford and qualified as a solicitor in the early 1970s. In 1973, William became legal officer at the National Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty). He acted for several communities experiencing discrimination including Travellers, young people, LGBTQ+ communities, and servicemen who had deserted, as well as defending the right to protest. He wrote briefings to parliament before the introduction of stop and search, arguing that it was likely to discriminate against ethnic minorities. He was also a pioneer in his understanding of the role that the European court of human rights could play in challenging unjust laws and practices – and was the first person to challenge corporal punishment at the European level. Alongside his trailblazing legal work, William created a vibrant social circle around him. He entertained, and sometimes housed, a variety of misfits, waifs, strays, and even farm animals. In his spare time, he enjoyed sailing and having heated arguments about Brexit over a pint in the clubhouse. His marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his two children, Megan and me, and two stepchildren, Penny and Kirsty.",News/Law,William Nash obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/13/william-nash-obituary

The Armada portrait of Elizabeth I, commemorating the failed invasion of England by Spain in 1588, a rare contemporary painting of Mary I, and Andy Warhol’s 1985 richly coloured image of the present-day monarch are among highlights of the free exhibition on each of the seven queens regnant of Britain, held at the London auction house Sotheby’s from 28 May to 15 June. Also on display will be a panoply of 50 tiaras lent by aristocratic houses of UK and European provenance, charting the history of the stately jewellery from the late 18th century when it was introduced to courtly fashion by Napoleon Bonaparte and Empress Josephine. It includes an impressive diamond tiara from the 1880s, with ornate scrollwork and foliate detailing, and an exquisite turquoise cabochon and diamond tiara by Van Cleef & Arpels from the 1960s. The exhibitions form part of a jubilee arts festival by Sotheby’s, a partner of the jubilee pageant, in conjunction with the luxury carmaker Aston Martin. As well as music and performing arts events, speakers will include the actor Joanna Lumley, the author Michael Morpurgo and the historian Tristram Hunt.

A group of three royal bindings for Elizabeth I, Queen Anne and Elizabeth II will be on view from Wormsley Library. These include Archbishop Matthew Parker’s binding for Elizabeth I with her crest on the cover, an embroidered Bible in silver and gold threads with Queen Anne’s crowned initials on the cover, and a finely bound coronation Bible for Elizabeth II, one of 25 special copies used at the Queen’s coronation on 2 June 1953. The series of events culminates in a jubilee auction on 29 June, dedicated to the best of British art from the old masters through to 20th-century giants and some of the greatest artists still working today. The sale will include a new work of the Queen donated by Chris Levine, proceeds from which will benefit the pageant. “Britain has long been known for its creativity and the Queen has been at the helm of this throughout her reign – both as custodian of a world-class collection and the inspiration for artists, designers and more,” said Frances Christie, the deputy chair of Sotheby’s UK and Ireland. “Her Majesty will become the first British monarch to celebrate 70 years of service, the perfect opportunity for Sotheby’s, with our unique position at the helm of both art and luxury, to celebrate creativity in all its forms, art, music, literature, food, fashion and performing arts.” Details for bookings and of further events can be found at www.sothebys.com/jubilee.",News/UK news,Portraits of queens past and present to go on show to mark platinum jubilee,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/portraits-of-queens-past-and-present-to-go-on-show-to-mark-platinum-jubilee
4/13/2022,"Brendan Rodgers has urged Leicester City to write more history by reaching their first European semi-final after lifting the FA Cup for the first time last year. Leicester visit PSV Eindhoven on Thursday in the second leg of the Europa Conference League quarter-final with the tie finely poised after a stalemate last Thursday. Leicester exited the Champions League to Atlético Madrid at the quarter-final stage five years ago and Rodgers is keen for his side to experience more European nights. “To be the first to do anything is always nice,” Rodgers said. “We had that feeling with the FA Cup and it was a great feeling. We are a club unlike PSV, because I’ve read that they have qualified for 48 European competitions on the trot which shows you the history they have in European competitions. “We are the complete opposite to that, very inexperienced, but the only way you do is by achieving. This is a great opportunity for us to do that. The first leg gives us great motivation that we can do that.” Leicester prevailed against Rennes in the previous round and Rodgers and his captain, Kasper Schmeichel, acknowledged they must cope with a “cauldron” atmosphere in the Netherlands. Schmeichel, one of seven players still at the club who featured in the 2016-17 campaign, has won the Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield with Leicester, having seen their remarkable rise after winning the Championship in 2014. “We probably aren’t the biggest, flashiest club about but we have consistently been able to mix it with the big boys and have done a good job of it so far,” Schmeichel said. “We had a similar situation in Rennes [in March] where there was a lot of noise and an expectant [home] crowd. In the last round we came into a cauldron which was fantastic and we rose to the occasion. This will be no different. But the expectation which we set ourselves couldn’t really be higher.” Jamie Vardy remains sidelined with a knee injury but the defender Jonny Evans will return after being rested for Sunday’s victory against Crystal Palace. “It’s all to play for,” Rodgers said. “It’s important to be aggressive and keep the strong mentality we have at the moment. We go with no fear. We are looking forward to it.”",Sport/Football,‘All to play for’: Brendan Rodgers eyes Leicester history at PSV Eindhoven,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/brendan-rodgers-eyes-leicester-history-psv-eindhoven-europa-conference-league
4/13/2022,"This show is dedicated to women of resistance, specifically four Rosas – Parks, Luxemburg, Bonheur, and a 15-year-old named Rosa who died in Belgian floods last year. But it couldn’t be less strident or less vocal in its intentions. It’s also inspired by roses – their petal formations – and rosaries, via the 17th-century music of Heinrich Biber. Biber’s Mystery Sonatas were written to accompany rosary bead prayers, a ritual that might lull one into a trance-like state – one that’s suggestive of the effect of Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker’s choreography in this work that contains plenty of its own mysteries. There is much beauty in Biber’s music (recorded, not live, sadly) – the sweet, keening melodies, the minor harmonies resolving to major, the essential lightness of its dance rhythms. The dancers carry themselves with that same lightness, bodies neutral, no unnaturally pulled-up ballet poise, no dramatic reach and stretch. There’s an artlessness to their simple moves: walking steps, light leaps, arms roving around them. De Keersmaeker crafts with rigorously worked out forms and repetition. The dancers don’t copy obvious shapes or rhythms in the music, but they are tied to it with internal logic. Some systems reveal themselves (like a series of rotating circles), some don’t. There is some stunning lighting by Minna Tiikkainen, including a scene where it looks as if light beams are being poured from a giant jug on to the stage. The flip side of other subtly dramatic light washes is a general level of dimness that’s intensely soporific when stretched out over two-plus hours (way too long, with sorely diminishing returns). But there are surprises, too, as when suddenly the stage is flooded in fuschia light, an old country song strikes up and a man walks steadily towards us with zero expression and one arm held at 90 degrees in front of him. Then he takes his trousers off. Funny old contemporary dance. Question marks are followed by divine moments, the same dancer launched on the swell of the music and gently folding to the floor; tableaux of tangled bodies that look as if they are lifted from a canvas. We can only watch the patterns play out and wonder while the dancers talk wordlessly to themselves, praying to the god of Anne Teresa.

But this has been a concern for working-class families for well over a decade. It has only become a “crisis” now that it has begun to affect middle-class families too. I grew up in Whinney Banks in Middlesbrough, one of the most deprived areas in England, with almost a third of children living in income-deprived households. My mum is a first-generation immigrant, and my parents had to start from nothing here. They lived on top of a corner shop where they worked for less than the minimum wage. When I was born, they weren’t eligible for benefits. For a while, we were homeless – when my mum was heavily pregnant with my brother – and I took my first steps in a hostel for families. The cost of living crisis isn’t new. What is new is the utter lack of support to families who are in a similar situation to mine. We were eventually moved from the homeless hostel into a brand-new council house a few streets away from the corner shop where my parents used to work. Such housing is available to far fewer people now. Providing families with safe housing as quickly as possible is not treated as a priority in the way it was for us back then. Whinney Banks community centre and library, or “the Youthy” as we called it, was the place where I first used a computer and created my first embarrassingly named email address. It was where my mum made friends with other local mums in a cooking class, even though she was already an amazing cook. It’s where me and my brother would spend almost every half-term going on trips on a minibus with other local children or playing games in the sports hall. It’s where I would go every day after school to read an endless number of books. It’s gone now. It closed in 2009 and was replaced with new-build homes, totally unaffordable for people like us. When it was bulldozed, it took with it the feeling that opportunities were within reach. We’re not alone in Whinney Banks – there has been a 74% cut to youth services in the last decade. When I was chosen to make this film in collaboration with the Guardian, I wanted to bring these issues to light, but also wanted to tell a positive story about the people who were trying to plug the gaps left by the loss of youth and community services. We filmed with Rev Kath Dean, who runs a food bank from her church in Grove Hill, where she can only heat one room in which local children are read bible stories after school. We met Mark Horkan who runs the White Feather Project in North Ormesby. It’s a community store where people can buy their weekly shop for a fraction of the price they would usually pay for it. They also hand out food parcels to those in need and put on events like parades and discos for children in the area. While filming, we found that these people felt like exhausted ship crews endlessly bailing water from a leaking boat without the resources to plug the holes. People like Kath and Mark have been trying to keep things together within their community for years now, and they need more support. During filming, another hard winter hit, and with it another wave of the coronavirus. We felt the mood turn in North Ormesby, the area of Middlesbrough where we focused our film. People on the streets were slumping their shoulders and looking down at their feet. We also found that it was hard to get to speak to those who were using the food banks we visited. They felt too degraded. Speaking on BBC Question Time in September 2021, the managing director of Iceland, Richard Walker, pointed out that there were more than 2,200 food banks in the UK, while there were around 1,300 McDonald’s restaurants. Politics has gone cold. Government ministers are visiting food banks for photo opportunities while voting against plans to extend free school meals during the school holidays and voting for the removal of the £20 a week universal credit uplift. We shouldn’t be accepting food banks as a new norm. People are being forced into using them when they deserve the autonomy and dignity of being able to buy their own food. People like Mark and Kath are doing what they can and their resolve to help their local community by filling people’s stomachs should be commended. But we need political intervention rather than community intervention. I was partly lifted out of poverty because of the help I received through government funding for community services, and that’s what we need now. In the midst of this, a council byelection was called in North Ormesby in which Mark decided to stand as an independent candidate. But the weight of supporting people through the tough winter, with Storm Arwen and Storm Barra battering the north-east with torrential rain and wind, left him with little time to go door-knocking to hand out leaflets and talk to residents for his campaign. The Labour party had a team of people out doing just that and it won the seat – an important turning point for it in the town. But they won with a turnout of just 12.5%. If politics wants to appeal to people in places like Middlesbrough, it needs to start delivering for them. Westminster feels far removed from the day-to-day reality for people living in towns like ours. We don’t want politicians turning up on our doorstep for photos to post on their social media accounts to show off their poster child for the ambiguous levelling up agenda. Politicians need to earnestly engage with us to enact change that is needed to afford everyone the same opportunities. We want existing services to be sufficiently supported, and for services like those that helped me when I was growing up to return.

4/13/2022,"Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian’s new (and free) women’s football newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below. I will not have been the only one in recent weeks to have turned my eyes to the west coast of America as one of the most eagerly-awaited arrivals to the NWSL seized centre stage. On 20 March, Angel City FC finally took to the field at the Titan Stadium in California under the guidance of the head coach, Freya Coombe. They emerged to a raucous reception as they made their much-anticipated professional debut. From this side of the Atlantic too, and across the world, it has been hard not to get caught up in the enthusiasm. Since Natalie Portman and her star-studded board and investors were awarded expansion rights by the NWSL in July 2020, the interest in their efforts both on and off the pitch has continued to grow. As Coombe says, this distinctive group of more than 100 co-owners, two-thirds of whom are women, have added an energy to the project like no other: “It is incredible. Natalie Portman spoke to the whole team on our first day and really set the stage for what is being built here and showed the players that they are a part of something special from the outset.” The NWSL expansion draft is an alien concept to someone like me, a product of the English football system. But while the expansion process proves a test for any team, Coombe believes there are positives to the system that allows a project like Angel City to emerge. “It is an opportunity to write your own story,” she says. “Angel City is doing things so differently that never would have been possible with an established club. We are attracting new fans and sponsors and shedding a new light on the league as a whole.” On the pitch, Coombe’s side has come together in a flurry. Since November, they have quickly assembled a roster of players and staff to compete. The names are there, the most prominent of which is the LA-born Christen Press, but it will inevitably take time for the jigsaw to fall into place. The Challenge Cup, essentially a pre-season competition, provides the platform to do just that. While their start has been tricky – three losses and one draw – Coombe knows success will not happen overnight: “We have a journey ahead, but you can see that we are coming together as a cohesive unit. Every game we learn more and more.” Perhaps where Angel City is most ground-breaking is its outreach work within the community. Their vast array of partners must commit 10% to local projects, aligning themselves with the organisation’s vision. From delivering meals, to school gardening projects and community events, the club is setting new standards for the sport. In the meantime, however, focus will return to the pitch as the regular season approaches. Angel City will move into their new home, the 22,000-capacity Banc of California Stadium, for their NWSL opener against North Carolina Courage on 29 April. With 15,000 season tickets sold and six official supporter groups already established, the anticipation around the team is infectious. “Supporters planted the seed to bring an NWSL club to Los Angeles,” says Coombe. “They showed up in incredible numbers at our first preseason Challenge Cup game and their support hasn’t wavered … it’s not just attendance. 465,000 watched our pre-season game against San Diego two weeks ago, which is the second highest viewership of any MLS or NWSL game in 2022. That shows that people are paying attention to what we are doing and want to be a part of Angel City history.” I, along with many others, will be keeping a close eye on their progress. The interest and supporter numbers they have generated in a relatively short amount of time are truly remarkable. New era in North Macedonia: It has been a special year for the women’s game there. On 8 March, the Football Federation of North Macedonia launched its first ever women’s football strategy. Spearheaded by Ana Trajkova, its goals are to develop a competitive domestic league, increase awareness and develop national teams at both youth and senior levels. “We will do everything that we can to provide the best for women’s football to go straight ahead and to make it sport No 1 for girls and women in our country,” she says. Very much a young nation on the international stage – their first official senior match was in 2005 – the energy around the sport is palpable. Bend It Like Beckham at 20: As a young girl, with little access to football, my contribution to the sport I loved was mainly in my dreams. That is why Bend It Like Beckham hit so close to home, providing visibility for many who had never seen themselves before in mainstream media. This iconic movie celebrates its 20th anniversary this week, a cinematic success that helped to shape a generation. But it wasn’t only for the women’s football narrative that it should be celebrated. It was in many ways ahead of its time. Steeped in humour, Gurinder Chadha’s creation tackled many inequalities – sexism; racism; homophobia – throughout that we fight so passionately against today.

4/13/2022,"When a company tries to cut its carbon footprint, how far should it cast the net? Is it responsible for the choices of its customers? What if it sells something that doesn’t have a carbon footprint at all – until the second it’s used? For some companies, flush with cash, the answer is easy enough. Microsoft, for instance, has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030, and ultimately removing from the environment all the carbon it has ever emitted by 2050. In that accounting, it’s even accepting the cost of downstream use of its products: if you’ve powered an Xbox on a diesel generator, or charged a Zune using coal power, Microsoft will offset those emissions. But for others, the decisions are trickier. The games industry, in some ways, faces the purest distillation of this question. It produces a leisure product, which exists almost entirely in software, and can, depending on decisions made by the developer, use as much electricity as boiling a kettle or as little as powering a wristwatch. So what does it mean to be a climate-conscious game developer? This weekend, I spent some time at the WASD event in London, hoping to find an answer. Tamara Alliot, the chief executive of game developer Nerial – and a former sustainability manager before she moved into games – points out that there are lots of ways that a developer can tackle its footprint before even needing to pay attention to the trickier philosophical points. “The impact of playing the games is one of the impacts of the industry, but it’s not the only thing,” she says. “I think we have to acknowledge that there is a video game supply chain, and a hardware lifecycle. The life of the hardware, the energy and the materials used to make the computers themselves – that’s something everybody needs to take some responsibility for.” In traditional carbon accounting, the biggest expenditure for a small indie studio like Alliot’s is probably travel, according to Graeme Struthers, the co-founder of publisher Devolver, who will publish Nerial’s forthcoming Card Shark. “A lot of companies are going to be going through the process of trying to cut their emissions and finding the that, because they’re suddenly largely remote, they can’t – and they shouldn’t – be going into any employee’s life and saying ‘you need to put a jumper on! You need to turn down the heating!’ And so because of that, it’s travel to events like [WASD] that’s the biggest piece of the puzzle.” Big fish, little fish, cardboard box Some developers have made major changes in the areas that are under their control. Sports Interactive, the developer of Football Manager, decided two years ago to be the change it wants to see in the world, and stopped shipping the game in plastic boxes entirely. “We are replacing the plastic box that is typically used across the industry with a reinforced, 100% recycled gatefold cardboard sleeve, made with 100% recycled fibres,” the company’s chief executive, Miles Jacobson, said at the time. “We’ve changed the printing on the packaging to vegetable and water-based ink with a recycled paper manual inside and have managed to source recyclable shrink wrap to encase the packaging and keep it secure on its travels.” Others have taken the approach that, as a cultural industry, the impact games can make on minds is likely to far outweigh any efficiency tweaks in office space. “As game developers, what we can do is work towards, with everybody else, to create an environment where change feels inevitable; where change feels like it’s a thing that should happen,” Tomas Rawlings, of Bristol-based Auroch Digital told the event, comparing the shift he hoped to engender to the change attitudes towards drink-driving a generation earlier. But I was surprised, as I toured the event, by how few people had even thought of the question in the terms I was putting it. The back of the envelope maths that had taken me to the event felt stark: a top-of-the-line gaming PC, running a new game at the highest graphical fidelity possible, will draw around 1kW of power; around the same as a kettle. (That’s not counting the electricity required for the monitor, and let’s not even touch on the difficulties of estimating the power consumption of multiplayer components). By contrast, a Nintendo Switch draws just 10W, about the same as a dim light bulb, while playing a game like Breath of the Wild. It’s actually about ethics in video games production Talking about ethics and obligations in climate action is always difficult, and doubly so when discussing a leisure activity which, let’s be honest, no one needs to do at all. But I can’t think of many other activities where the carbon footprint can differ a hundred-fold with so little practical difference for the user. If you play games, the revelation probably makes little difference to you. Unless you live a very, very strange life, the electricity used by your gaming machine of choice is a tiny fraction of your personal footprint. (And if you do live that strange life, then honestly, your decision to become a vegan shut-in who sits in a tiny house heated exclusively by the exhaust from your massive gaming rig is probably sort of ethically praiseworthy). But if you make games, I’m not so sure the difference can be easily shrugged off. Take Elden Ring, the current star of the zeitgeist. According to analytics site SteamSpy, the PC version has between 10 and 20m owners, with an average total playtime of 77 hours, drawing (let’s say) 500W per player. That means the game has consumed, in its first six weeks on sale, between 385GWh and 770GWh of electricity. Just on the PC version: it’s also out on Xbox and PlayStation. For comparison, in the same period, Hornsea One, the largest offshore windfarm in the world, can output 1,200GWh of electricity – if the wind is blowing just right the whole time. What decisions could the developers have made to reduce that power draw? Could they have locked the frame rate of the game, or limited the resolutions it can be played at? Could they even have changed the entire visual style of the game? Such changes may seem drastic, but even a small change, one that lessened the power draw of the game by a single percentage point, would almost certainly outweigh any conventional savings the studio could make if it scrapped all staff flights, switched to entirely renewable energy for its office heating, and shipped its games in cardboard boxes. There would be more benefits than just the direct ones, too. A self-imposed moratorium on ever-more computationally intensive games would have the effect of extending the lifespan of gaming hardware, reducing the embedded emissions in every console and graphics card sold. It would lower the costs of development for everyone, freeing up the thousands of people who spend their professional lives perfectly simulating horse testicles and modelling rocks and trees. And it would finally stop bitcoin fans replying to every article I write about the energy intensive nature of their hobby with a snide “what about video games?”.

4/13/2022,"The notion of making your masterpiece while sequestered deep in the woods has been seducing artists since Henry David Thoreau in the 1850s, if not long before. Daniel Rossen, a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter with lauded indie band Grizzly Bear, wasn’t immune to it. When he and his wife had tired of Brooklyn a decade ago, they moved upstate in New York, and he hoped to capture in his nascent solo music the “impactful, unforgettable” connection to the land that he experienced there. He released the lovely, haunted Silent Hour/Golden Mile EP in 2012. Then, nothing. The longer he stayed there, the more distanced from his work he became. “I got sort of lost up there, in my own head, in an almost depressive rumination about my life,” says Rossen, 39, Zooming from his home – now in Santa Fe, New Mexico – in late March. “I ended up feeling like there was some connection between a longing for a sense of place and the way that ruminating, depressive mind states can chisel you into place.” He lost touch with his motivation to pursue music publicly, struggled with alcohol and dark winters, and battled self-criticism when he did try to write. He paraphrases something he read the late David Berman saying once: “‘As you get older, fighting the onslaught of terrible ideas becomes even more challenging’. I don’t know if that’s exactly true but sometimes I felt that way – it’s a lot more confusing to navigate what’s valid and what isn’t.” Rossen, speaking early in his time zone, is a little grey around the edges, and apologises for being dog-tired after his poorly toddler gave everyone a sleepless night. It was her impending birth, a move south, the pandemic and his looming 40th birthday that kicked him back into gear musically. “I needed to complete some kind of statement that I could feel proud of because it’s been a really long time,” he says. Finally released this month, his debut solo album, You Belong There, is a beautiful thicket of woodwind and fingerpicked guitar, and the sort of conflicted crescendos and forceful tides that gave Grizzly Bear their power. Getting back to tactile instrumentation and connecting with music from the pre-rock’n’roll era – the things he had loved as a teenager – was another spur to finish it. Rossen played almost everything on the record, teaching himself new instruments such as clarinet and upright bass. “It’s an extension of your body in a way that is so different from working on synthesisers,” he says. He knew that if he tried to revisit his past, he faced the danger that those old loves might not be there any more. “But actually, I felt like I picked up some threads that were waiting for a really long time,” he says happily. “That’s very comforting to me – as I get older, I don’t know how much I have left to give in terms of music, and it was nice to discover: no, there’s this whole lost approach that is still there. I think there’s still something to be explored there. It’s not just nostalgia for me.” Much of You Belong There deals with an imbalance of harmony, whether in families (different parts of Rossen’s, whose grandfather was blacklisted Hollywood director Robert Rossen, have “this absolute inability to get over and distance from one another”, he says), nature or habitat. Life is easier in Santa Fe, where his wife Amelia Bauer grew up, says Rossen: brighter, more expansive, open. “I was actually able to work here in a way that I couldn’t find the focus when I was [upstate].” He certainly hasn’t been to Williamsburg, the Brooklyn neighbourhood that became synonymous with Grizzly Bear and their refined indie kin at the turn of the early 2010s, in years, he says. “I don’t even know what happens there any more.” After this strange, quiet band went overground in 2009 when Beyoncé and Jay-Z were pictured at one of their concerts, they pushed against the grain and made “intentionally anti-pop music” with their 2012 album Shields. Its ornery origins didn’t stop them from becoming even bigger and gaining a reputation that intruded on Rossen’s conception of the band. “We were kids living in Williamsburg in 2009, 2010,” he says. “We had a successful time – of course we came to represent a certain kind of millennial, naive, hipster culture. What am I going to do about that? It was tricky, I feel funny about it because I really don’t identify with that and I fell into it. Everybody was just trying to have a nice time.” He backed off from bringing emotionally transparent songs to what became their last album to date, 2017’s Painted Ruins (“it wasn’t the right venue for that kind of expression”). The band prioritised diplomacy during its creation. “Shields was more like everybody pushing at each other and trying to make something good and important,” he says. “By the time we got to the last record, it was more like: let’s try to enjoy this, go easy on each other and make sure everybody’s feeling good.” Tellingly, few bands from that era have stayed together – Dirty Projectors and Fleet Foxes are essentially one-man bands now. Rossen says Grizzly Bear are all still friends and they haven’t split up – “you never know when that chemistry is gonna come back” – and laments the irrelevance of “boring gossip” about the band to his new record. He perks up when I mention how much of my life I can remember through those albums, like a first kiss to a song on their 2009 masterpiece Veckatimest. When we speak, Rossen is days from jumping in his car for a small-scale solo tour. “That’s a really nice part of doing shows like this,” he says. “I enjoy that there’s this whole back catalogue and this backlog of songs that were never released that are still very special and that I feel very close with.” In one sense, he thinks “getting in my car and playing shows is absurd” – no born performer, he prefers to hide in the background, and he’s conscious of putting his family through something “that I should have gotten over when I was 25”. But he’s also trying to embrace the relative freedoms that come with pursuing music in midlife. “I am now at an age where I have nothing to lose,” he says, “so I might as well pursue my interests and not care about what anybody thinks.” His wife is also an artist. “All we’re trying to do is keep our modest existence we have and make space for ourselves to make work at whatever level of success that is, and try to make it sustainable for us. I don’t expect to have a good career any more. I expect to make music that feels honest, and the few people that care about it – that’s going to have to be enough.” His own connection to music, though, has been restored. He thinks You Belong There feels stiff (it doesn’t) but hopes it might “get me to another phase where I can be a little bit easier on myself, a little bit more light on my feet, and try new ideas faster”, he says. And he’s prepared for the tour to expose some raw nerves. “I’m a kind of weepy guy these days,” he laughs softly. “But if that happens on stage, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. What’s the point of doing a solo show alone if you’re not going to do that?”  You Belong There is out now on Warp",Arts/Music,Grizzly Bear’s Daniel Rossen on going solo and self-criticism: ‘I don’t expect to have a good career anymore’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/13/grizzly-bears-daniel-rossen-on-going-solo-and-self-criticism-i-dont-expect-to-have-a-good-career-anymore
