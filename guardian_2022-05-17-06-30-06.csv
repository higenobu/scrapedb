5/17/2022,"Alan Bennett once defined a classic as a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have. For a modern bestseller, the formula needs rejigging only slightly – a book everyone feels they have read, even if they have gone out of their way to avoid it. Even if Bridget Jones’s Diary or The Da Vinci Code are not your bag, you absorb so much by osmosis that it becomes irrelevant whether or not you have scanned the pages. As such, most people know the basics of The Time Traveler’s Wife, Audrey Niffenegger’s debut that – aided by a 2009 film adaptation – has sold in its millions since it was published in 2003. A librarian called Henry has a rare genetic disorder that causes him to travel through time at random, landing dazed and naked wherever the cosmos takes him. He learns to find his feet (and some clothes) a little faster each time. In the course of his many unchronological journeys, he meets his soulmate, Clare. They are wrenched repeatedly from each other’s arms to reunite weeks, months or years later in more or less romantic scenarios, depending on their ages at the time. It is, in short, guff of a high order. But the new six‑part adaptation (Sky Atlantic) by Steven Moffat (a longtime fan of the book, which he used as inspiration for the Doctor Who episode The Girl in the Fireplace) does it proud. He takes the melodrama down a notch and salts the schmaltz with wit where he can. Nonetheless, an emetic framing device remains. Each episode opens with Clare (Rose Leslie, joyfully channelling the spark of Game of Thrones’ Ygritte, rather than the drippiness of The Good Fight’s Maia) and/or Henry (Theo James, acquitting himself well after many years paying dues in Divergent films) talking wistfully about their lives. It is an unnecessary few minutes of marking time while they say things such as: “The future is something that turns up when you’re looking for something else,” and: “For everyone else, the past is over. For me, I’m still trying to survive it.” Once the action kicks in, though, Moffatt keeps a tight hold on the reins. He allows Henry’s appearances, disappearances and reappearances to create a choppy energy rather than chaos. The great trauma of Henry’s past (and future, as he returns to the scene at various ages, always powerless to avert his mother’s fate) is unpacked, while troubles are foreshadowed from different angles and eras before they come to pass. James makes credible Henry’s evolution from brash young “asshole” – Clare’s word – to god among men, even if the camera panning mournfully across the piles of clothes he leaves behind every time he vanishes is always inescapably amusing. The feet thing – I shall say no more for fear of spoilers – raises similar issues. It is a good story, well retold, but it has two intrinsic problems to overcome – and hurdles one more successfully than the other. The first is the ick factor occasioned by Henry’s many visits as a grown man to Clare as a child. This raised eyebrows in 2003 and sensitivities have only increased since. Moffatt confronts it head-on by having Henry acknowledge the viewer’s potential discomfort (via a line from Clare about grooming her My Little Pony), but a queasiness remains inevitable. The other problem is more deep-rooted. Niffenegger’s story is built around Clare’s passivity. Her life, while not static or unfulfilled professionally, is defined by waiting for Henry. Her happiness depends on his random visits. More profoundly, her whole being and sexuality are shaped around him from the very earliest days. It reminds me more of the terrible messaging in Twilight – subsume thyself, woman! Don’t knock true love off its course by being yourself! – than an adult romance. It is slightly depressing, chiming more with the elements of society that would like women to make themselves smaller and quieter and cede space and rights to louder others than with the elements that encourage them to strike the board and cry: “No more!” I would rather a series that felt as if it was with those who want to push us forward, rather than back in time.",Arts/Television & radio,The Time Traveler’s Wife review – far too much ick factor to be truly great,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/16/the-time-travelers-wife-review-far-too-much-ick-factor-to-be-truly-great
5/17/2022,"This time, Mikel Arteta will find the cupboard bare if he tries raiding it for complaints. He had been enraged by the decisions that brought Arsenal’s defeat to Spurs but this time there can be no obscuring the fact that, when they could least afford to blink, his team did not turn up. Champions League qualification is still possible but only if they beat Everton while Tottenham, surpassing even their own jittery reputation, are overcome by relegated Norwich. It remains a season of progress and the evidence is that, in any case, they are not quite ready for a place among the elite. A hungrier Newcastle were superior throughout and must wonder what 2022-23 will bring if they continue operating with this intensity and verve; Ben White’s own goal and a late Bruno Guimarães strike settled the affair but Eddie Howe’s team could have scored several more. One of the biggest difficulties for Arsenal at the outset was that, while Newcastle are bogged down in mid-table, this felt nothing like a dead rubber for the hosts. An electric atmosphere greeted the players, as did a flag display: the sense is that, when everyone reconvenes here in August, the Magpies’ prospects for the season will be transformed. Expensive new arrivals will doubtless be welcomed, as far as consciences allow, but this was an occasion to celebrate the work performed in heaving the existing crop to safety. It was a relief for Arteta, then, that White and Gabriel Magalhaes were both passed fit. There was surely some element of risk, given both centre-backs had been struggling with hamstring problems, but Arsenal could barely afford kid gloves. If Nuno Tavares’ selection at left-back offset the resulting sense of stability, it did mean the defence had a balance it lacked in defeat at Spurs. That did not stop it wobbling early on. Aaron Ramsdale has been a resounding success despite the nagging sense his exuberance may one day give rise to a costly blooper; it nearly occurred here, a casual attempt to play the ball out in the seventh minute seeing Miguel Almirón charge the ball down. Thankfully for Arsenal it rolled away from goal and Gabriel could hammer away. Newcastle used every opportunity to test Arsenal’s defensive rustiness with the running of Callum Wilson, on his first start since December after recovering from injury. He had already asked questions of Gabriel twice when, one-on-one with White, his opponent hauled him down. White was booked; Guimarães whipped the free-kick beyond everyone and his side continued to set a resounding tempo. Arsenal could get little going, White conceding possession easily to Guimarães on one occasion and Arteta glaring at Ramsdale when he had kicked waywardly on another. If those two are off beam it tends to be a warning sign; another came their way when Ramsdale got a hand to Sean Longstaff’s cross and, after Wilson nodded towards goal, Gabriel cleared. Newcastle were well on top and the din was deafening. When Bukayo Saka found a way into proceedings he tried to quieten it, playing a one-two with Martin Ødegaard but seeing Dan Burn block. He then cut in and drew a save from Martin Dubravka that, although routine, suggested Arsenal were beginning to settle. A draw would be as useful as a defeat and it seemed imperative that their attack started to function. They were generally second best in all areas, though, to Newcastle’s ferocity in the challenge. It reared up again when Guimarães, going in hard but fair, left Ødegaard in a heap and set Allan Saint-Maximin off. Ramsdale was alert to tip his drive wide; Ødegaard got up but Takehiro Tomiyasu had sustained a knock in the meantime and, while Arteta gathered his players for an impromptu team talk, Cédric Soares was deployed from the bench. He must have been relieved that, soon afterwards, he had 15 minutes to deliver a few home truths. They needed to show more aggression but Eddie Nketiah overdid it within moments of the restart when he clattered into Fabian Schär, inflicting a head injury that caused the defender’s replacement by Jamaal Lascelles. That was a concussion substitution; Arteta then made a conventional one in deploying Gabriel Martinelli for the quiet Emile Smith Rowe. The Brazilian immediately hinted he might offer the change in speed Arsenal required but, almost as quickly, his team were undone. The goal was entirely deserved. Joelinton was sent surging down the left flank and, as Mohamed Elneny made a futile attempt to cover, fizzed a devilish cross towards the six-yard box. Wilson looked poised to reach it but White, stretching to intervene, got there first. He could only send the ball zipping beyond Ramsdale; St James’ Park erupted save for the contingent of Arsenal fans, up in the gods, who were watching their chances evaporate. Wilson nearly ended them but volleyed the outstanding Guimarães’ delivery just over. Arteta sent on Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pépé, sacrificing two defenders, but Wilson came close with a spectacular effort from range and the substitute Jacob Murphy tested Ramsdale. Then Guimarães pounced after Ramsdale had denied Wilson; Arsenal were beaten fair and square.",Sport/Football,Bruno Guimarães caps Newcastle win to leave Arsenal’s top-four hopes in tatters,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
5/17/2022,"Pressure on the government to help those hardest hit by Britain’s cost of living crisis has intensified after the head of one of the country’s leading employers’ groups said immediate support was a “moral imperative”. Tony Danker, the director-general of the CBI, said Rishi Sunak should step in to provide assistance to households skipping meals as a result of rising food and fuel bills. Figures on Wednesday are expected to show the annual inflation rate rising above 9%, and Danker said it was “unacceptable” that people were faced with the choice of whether to heat their homes or eat. Sunak has pledged to provide more support for people affected by the latest sharp rise in energy prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Danker called on the chancellor not to wait until the autumn before acting. While urging caution about bowing to demands from some Tory MPs for a tax-cutting summer mini-budget, the head of the CBI said Sunak should move on two fronts at once. “The first is to help people facing real hardship now; it’s the moral underpinning of our economy and society,” Danker said. “Recent surveys suggest more than one in 10 households have skipped – or had smaller – meals in the past month because of a lack of affordability, while about half a million more households are expected to face choices between heating and eating. Putting pounds in the pockets of people struggling the most should not be delayed. “Secondly, start stimulating business investment now – we will need to ensure that there is economic growth in the pipeline to avoid any downturn in our economy that could worsen or prolong the cost-of-living crisis.” Danker said many of the people running UK businesses had never experienced the current combination of high inflation and weak growth, adding that confidence in boardrooms and among investors had been hit. Danker called for a five-point plan to boost investment: cashflow support for firms; a commitment to green growth; setting out a roadmap for infrastructure; ensuring money already announced flowed into the economy; and unlocking investment in digital. “The chancellor’s clear intention to use a forthcoming budget to cut taxes on business investment should become a firm commitment now,” he said. “It will ensure that any firm pausing on investment now will be bold, decisive and back their original plans. This matters for everyone because it guarantees that any slowdown in growth will have a short and shallow shelf life.” Danker was more cautious about backing a fully fledged mini-budget, expressing concern that a big stimulus package would further fuel inflationary pressure. “We do need to avoid big injections to economic demand that might worsen inflation, and focus on getting the supply side of our economy moving. So big economic boosters should be deferred until safe to do so. Government should stay flexible and support the economy in the right way at the right time.” The CBI is opposed to financing a support package through a windfall tax on North Sea energy companies, but would back Sunak if he decided to target poorer households through a one-off payment or an increase in universal credit. Energy bills for the average household rose by almost £700 to just under £2,000 a year in April, and the Bank of England is expecting a further £800-a-year rise in October.",News/Business,Cost of living crisis: immediate support from Sunak a ‘moral imperative’ – CBI ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/cost-of-living-crisis-immediate-support-from-sunak-a-moral-imperative-cbi
5/17/2022,"A day ahead of Joe Biden’s visit to Buffalo, the leading civil rights attorney Ben Crump said federal officials should define the mass shooting at a grocery store in the city on Saturday as an “act of domestic terrorism”. “We can’t sugarcoat it, we can’t try to explain it away talking about mental illness,” Crump said of the attacked allegedly perpetrated by Payton Gendron, 18, who is in custody on one charge of first-degree murder awaiting arraignment on Thursday where additional charges are likely to be filed. “No,” Crump said. “This was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated by a young white supremacist.” Ten people were killed and three wounded in the shooting. Representing the family of Ruth Whitfield, an 86-year-old woman who was among those killed in the two-minute attack, Crump said leaders “at the highest levels must be responsive to this”. “This was an act of domestic terrorists and America responds to terrorism at every level and they have to do that here,” Crump said as he stood before several members of the Whitfield family, some of whom wept quietly. “Just because it was a Black grocery store doesn’t make it any less than any other massacres, whether its Columbine or the Oklahoma City bombing.” Whitfield was killed after making a daily visit to her husband, Garnell Whitfield, in a nursing home. On Monday, Garnell Whitfield had not yet been told that his wife of 68 years was dead. Their son, the Buffalo fire commissioner, Garnell Whitfield Jr, said for his mother to be “taken from this world by someone full of hate for no reason, it’s very hard for us to handle right now”. “And you expect us to do this over and over and over again, forgive and forget,” he said, “while the people we elect do their best not to protect us, consider us equal, not to love us back? What do we do with all of this pain?” Crump has been involved in representing the families of George Floyd, Jacob Blake, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, all victims of police violence. He called on authorities to investigate how the Buffalo gunman developed hateful beliefs, including examining if “race replacement theory” played a role in the attack. But Crump also called out “accomplices to this mass murder”, which he identified as websites, politicians and cable news pundits. “Even though they didn’t pull the trigger, they did load the gun for this young white supremacist,” he said. Crump said federal legislators must pass a hate crimes bill before Congress – a reference to the George Floyd Justice in Policing bill, currently stalled – and that Biden must use his influence to secure such progress. “Black America is suffering right now,” he said. “And we need to know that our top leader in America reacts and responds when we are hurt.” The US justice department has said it is investigating the Buffalo massacre as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism. Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, will visit Buffalo on Tuesday. The George Floyd bill is likely to be discussed, alongside the the first’s family’s expressions of condolence to grieving families and the community at large. Attorneys co-representing the Whitfield family said they could file lawsuits against Bushmaster, maker of the assault-style weapon used in Buffalo, following successful legal actions against the makers of weapons used in mass shootings.The attorney Ken Abbarno said “all of the signs and red flags were there” to monitor the suspect and stop him acquiring a gun, including threatening comments that brought police to his high school last spring and triggered a mental health evaluation. Another attorney, Terry Connors, said he planned to help the Whitfield family get answers about how the shooting happened and how it was possible for an 18-year-old with such a history to purchase such a weapon, cross state lines and buy bullets. According to the Erie county sheriff, John Garcia, the suspect was visited last year by state police after he turned in a high-school project about murder-suicides. Buffalo police have said authorities are examining a 180-page manifesto Gendron appeared to have written and posted that referenced racist replacement theories. Also on Monday, the Buffalo police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, revealed that Gendron did not plan to limit his rampage to one branch of Tops Friendly Markets. “He was going to get in his car and continue to drive down Jefferson Avenue and continue doing the same thing,” the commissioner said. Gendron reportedly drove to Buffalo from his home several hours away on Friday to do “reconnaissance” of the area. At least one witness claims to have met him that day. Law enforcement found another rifle and a shotgun in the suspect’s car. As details of the planning of the shooting become clearer, so do its apparent motives. A screenshot posted on Crump’s Twitter account showed the alleged gunman had the number 14 stenciled on the barrel of his weapon, an apparent reference to a 14-word white supremacist phrase: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” The attack has also focused attention on social media livestream services. “Live streaming this attack gives me some motivation in the way that I know that some people will be cheering for me,” the suspect said as the attack was in progress. Amazon-owned Twitch, which hosted the suspect’s livestream via the account “jimboboiii” to roughly 20 other users, has said it has erased the video from servers. “The user has been indefinitely suspended from our service and we are taking all appropriate action including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content,” a Twitch spokesperson said. Clips of the attack were available on other platforms. One clip, uploaded to Streamable, was reported to have had 3m views before it was removed.",News/US news, Civil rights lawyer Crump: investigate Buffalo shooting as domestic terrorism,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/ben-crump-buffalo-shooting-domestic-terrorism
5/17/2022,"Jordan Rhodes came off the bench to score his fourth and most significant goal of the season to send Huddersfield into the Championship playoff final at Luton’s expense. Huddersfield were lucky to still be in the game when Rhodes poked home a free-kick with eight minutes to go to edge the tie but what matters in football is taking chances and, despite a barren season, the 32-year-old striker still knows how to get things done when it matters, a trait Luton lacked. A combination of flares, flags and clappers created the atmosphere at the John Smith’s Stadium. The home fans behind one goal spent the minutes prior to kick-off shaking the stand’s foundations in an attempt to intimidate the Luton supporters next to them. Luton should have taken the lead in the 11th minute when Kal Naismith drifted into space on the left and sent a low cross into the box for Harry Cornick to tap home but he sidefooted the ball from six yards straight at Lee Nicholls, much to the relief of the majority in the ground. Unlike many playoff semi-finals, there was little caution shown by either side. Huddersfield looked to play with great intensity to get through Luton, while the visitors’ pressing was causing problems for the hosts when they attempted to play out from the back. Luton moved the Huddersfield defence around to create gaps in wide areas. Robert Snodgrass took advantage to cut in from the right and curl a shot towards the corner which Nicholls palmed straight out to Amari’i Bell who could only jab the rebound wide. The game became frenetic with neither team able to maintain possession. Luton looked the more dangerous, however, with James Bree becoming the latest in orange to test Nicholls, who palmed away his shot from the edge of the area and was thankful to see it fall to the defender Pipa to turn it behind. Another Luton corner soon after went through all the bodies stationed along the six-yard line before trickling wide. It was the latest warning that Huddersfield needed to heed. Going so close to conceding ramped up the tension inside the ground. Danny Ward almost relieved it with a mazy run into the Luton box but he was stretching to shoot and failed to garner sufficient power in his jabbed effort, allowing Matt Ingram to palm away. Huddersfield looked unable to cope with the occasion, wanting to take too much time on the ball and being repeatedly caught out by Luton. The visitors maintained their intensity and almost took the lead when Allan Campbell got to the byline to chip a cross to the back post from the right but Bell could only direct his header across goal and wide. The only thing that looked to cause Luton problems was a lack of discipline creeping into their play. Jordan Clark was booked for a lunge on Rhodes, while Campbell received a lengthy talking to for a nibble at Lewis O’Brien after a free-kick had already been awarded to Huddersfield. Naismith joined Clark in the book for going through the back of the substitute Sorba Thomas. He took the free-kick which Tom Lees headed home unmarked long after the whistle had been blown for a push. The fans celebrated and a flare was thrown onto the pitch but the players knew there was nothing to cheer. Levi Colwill was forced to flick a curling Cornick shot in the 68th minute as Huddersfield continued to hold the repeated Luton attacks at bay. Huddersfield-born Cameron Jerome was the next to threaten his hometown club soon after coming off the bench. The striker got behind the home defence to head a deep free-kick towards goal but he could only direct the ball wide. Huddersfield finally came to life in the 74th minute, forcing Ingram to make two fine saves in quick succession. For the second he failed to gather properly and clashed with Harry Toffolo in the box as he attempted to collect the ball. Everyone in stripes demanded a penalty but the referee shook his head, earning the ire of the stadium in exchange. The fans were right, the referee wrong on this occasion. Thomas had provided dangerous deliveries since coming onto the pitch. He swung in a free-kick from the left to the back post where Rhodes showed his experience to hold off the challenge of Bell and slide the ball back across Ingram to bring delirium to Huddersfield which did not abate until the final whistle, nor will it in the town until they visit Wembley on Sunday 29 May.",Sport/Football,Late Rhodes goal sends Huddersfield to Wembley final after win over Luton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/huddersfield-luton-championship-playoff-semifinal-second-leg-match-report
5/17/2022,"Good morning. It’s crunch time for politicians on the home stretch of campaigning to sway undecided voters. And the US is reeling from a weekend of gun violence, with a refocus on the rhetoric pushing extremism and access to deadly weapons. The Labor frontbencher Penny Wong is being deployed to campaign in Liberal-held seats where voters are dissatisfied with Scott Morrison and there is a lack of teal independent to back. Strategists say Labor’s internal polling points to opportunity in four Liberal-held seats – Brisbane and Ryan in Queensland, Bennelong in Sydney and Higgins in Victoria. A new poll has predicted the independent Allegra Spender is on track to take the seat of Wentworth in Sydney’s east from the Liberal MP, Dave Sharma, based on preference flows. And in the seat of Groom, which has been held by conservatives since federation, Labor and independent candidates are shaking up the race. The massacre by a white supremacist gunman of Black shoppers at a Buffalo grocery store in the US and a spate of gun violence at the weekend has refocused attention on the toxic interplay of political ideology and easy access to handguns and battlefield weapons. The Buffalo shooting, in which 10 people were murdered, has drawn renewed scrutiny of Republican figures who have embraced the racist “great replacement theory” he is alleged to have used as justification for the murders. The extremist ideology expounds on the view that immigration will ultimately destroy white values and western civilisation. After Sweden and Finland yesterday confirmed plans to join Nato, Sweden is seeking to quell Turkish opposition by sending diplomats to the country. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said he will not approve Finland and Sweden joining the alliance and that delegations should not bother coming to Turkey to try convince him otherwise. Meanwhile, 20 civilians, including a child, were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Australia has quietly shut down a taskforce set up to counter violent extremism online after the Christchurch terror attack. The white 18-year-old charged with the murders of 10 people at a convenience store in Buffalo cited the manifesto of the Christchurch shooter in his own manifesto. Uber drivers have warned that there will be a mass industry exodus if base rates don’t increase to sustainable levels. The rising cost-of-living pressure and fees and charges are making rideshare services unprofitable for drivers. Mount Isa has been named the most polluted postcode in Australia, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation. Mount Isa Mines is responsible for 91% of the city’s emissions, despite having an “industry-leading air quality management framework”. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has sought to block federal funding for a Gold Coast light rail expansion that would run directly past an investment property she co-owns with her husband. Élisabeth Borne has been appointed France’s prime minister – the first woman to hold the post in more than 30 years and only the second female prime minister in modern French history. Boris Johnson has said a legal move to ditch parts of the Northern Ireland protocol is only an “insurance” policy as it emerged that the legislation has been delayed for some weeks. The financial crisis engulfing Sri Lanka will get worse and “the next couple of months will be the most difficult ones of our lives”, the country’s new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has warned. “Apocalyptic” food prices caused by Russia’s invasion could have a disastrous impact on the world’s poor, says the Bank of England governor, who has blamed the war in Ukraine for the highest inflation in the UK for three decades When it comes to getting more votes, political alignment and marketing razzle-dazzle are key. Let’s say that every person has some innate political preference – left, right or somewhere in between. The argument was that people vote for the party who is the closest to their position. Over time, Australians have become more likely to identify strongly with one side or the other. Yet it is still true that we are most likely to be centrists, and sit on the fence – at least in our own reckoning. So, what wins more votes: making speeches, kissing babies or digging holes? Ask a visible mender to explain why they love to repair clothes using patches or colourful darning and the response will usually include storytelling. Most menders pride themselves on adding to the history of a garment: a cleverly patched hole is evidence of something saved from landfill. They’ll also insist it shouldn’t be perfect. The charm of the visible mend lies in the character of its flaws, so the important thing is to have a go. Here’s some advice from expert visible menders on how to get started. “When I lost a parent to suicide, there was a week or two of numbness,” writes Isobel Beech. “I suppose it was shock. And then I began pretending everything was fine. I began writing my book, Sunbathing, in the winter of 2019 while attending a writing residency in Italy … I wrote late into the night. I wrote about fear and grief and what being left behind feels like. I wrote about relationships and regrets and what we’re supposed to do with the knowledge that people can exit this earth willingly, and it will sometimes feel like your fault. In writing, I found that there was a whole room of things I needed to say.” This week more than 1.2 million people are voting for the first time – a cohort made up of young people and new citizens. But a Plan International report has found three-quarters of young women voting for the first time don’t feel politics is an equal space for women and people of colour.

5/17/2022,"My mother, Gloria Randall, who has died aged 91, was a social worker who was attuned to the particular needs of Jewish refugee clients, having fled Nazi persecution aged eight. As a pioneer in the social work field of the new NHS, she was also a team leader in complex family care cases. Born in Hamburg, Gloria was the daughter of Sascha (nee Rares), an actress, and Fritz Mangold, a solicitor. The family’s assimilated status was no protection from the Nazis and Gloria had to wear a yellow star before being excluded from school. Thanks to the sponsorship of a relative in London, the family made it to Britain just before the outbreak of the second world war. Gloria grew up in Leatherhead, Surrey, and attended Sutton high school. She took a certificate in social science at Edinburgh University (1951), followed by an Institute of Medical Social Work professional qualification (1954). As an assistant medical social worker she had posts at a number of hospitals around London, starting with the Prince of Wales hospital, Tottenham. These services had been provided by charities before the NHS was founded and one outraged client demanded to know what happened to his “lady almoner”. Gloria worked her way up the medical social work grades in the 1950s and 60s, with a break in 1963, when she lived in Israel for a couple of years, taking up archaeology, living on a kibbutz and working as a medical social worker at Bet Loewenstein rehabilitation hospital. In 1965, back in the UK, she became a senior medical social worker at University College hospital, London, attached to obstetrics, and then went to work as a social worker for Enfield council. She also lectured and supervised students studying at University College hospital, the Institute for Medical Social Workers and the North Western Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University). From 1977 to the late 80s she worked at Haringey social services. Gloria’s career culminated in the 90s in assessing accommodation for increasingly frail former refugees with the charity Jewish Care. She was particularly moved when one concentration camp survivor said she always carried her passport in her handbag because “you never know”. She retired in the mid-90s. Though she never described herself as a survivor, her formative years directed her formidable energies towards those who were displaced. She was an active member of the Association of Jewish Refugees and curated her family’s wartime letters for the Weiner Holocaust library. Devoted to her family, Gloria also maintained a wide circle of friends. She loved the opera, and her theatre group shared her passion for new productions and good meals. She married David Randall, a mathematician and civil servant, in 1969. He died in 2011. Gloria is survived by me, a granddaughter, Miriam, her brother, Tom, and three nieces.",News/Society,Gloria Randall obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/gloria-randall-obituary
