3/13/2022,"Rod Stewart is doing his own form of public service by filling in potholes near his Essex estate. The 77-year-old Hard Road singer posted videos of himself on Instagram shovelling gravel near his home in Harlow, Essex, saying “I’m repairing the street near where I live because no one can be bothered to do it”. They say the first rut is the deepest, and Stewart bemoaned the damage poor road maintenance could cause to his Ferrari. “People are bashing their cars up,” he said. “The other day, there was an ambulance with a burst tyre. My Ferrari can’t go through here at all.” “We are filling in the holes ourselves while millions and millions of pounds are being spent on the M11,” he added. Stewart wore a tracksuit and hi-vis tabard to do the shovelling, after he was mocked on Instagram for wearing all-white to clean out his garage during the first lockdown. Should Harlow experience flooding, Stewart will no doubt emerge with sandbags and his gladrags. His intervention came in the week that his wife, Penny Lancaster, made her first arrest as a special constable with the City of London police. She applied to join the police as a volunteer officer after taking part in reality TV programme Famous and Fighting Crime where she joined officers on the beat. Last year, Stewart told the Guardian he wasn’t concerned for his wife as she patrolled the streets. “She wants to look after the city she loves, which is London. Go girl! She’s 6ft 2in, so I don’t have to worry about her,” he said. It is not the first time Stewart has locked horns with his local council. In 2020, the conservation department of Epping Forest District Council objected to his plans to upgrade the windows in his Grade II-listed, 10-bedroom mansion, which he bought for £4.65m in 2013. Despite his reputation as one of the world’s most enduring rockers, Stewart has increasingly used social media to reveal his domestic side, under the tagline: “Wake up Maggie I’ve got something to Instagram”. In November, he posted a video of his family washing up after dinner while he danced around the kitchen with a yellow dishcloth on his head.",News/World news,‘My Ferrari can’t go through’: Rod Stewart fills potholes outside his Essex estate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/my-ferrari-cant-go-through-rod-stewart-fills-potholes-outside-his-essex-estate
3/13/2022,"For Amy McLennan, it has felt like taking on the full might of the medical establishment – and it was never going well. “I thought we were going to lose. Up against the NHS? Of course I did.” Defeat, she said, would have been a death sentence for her 17-year-old son, William Verden. William, who is autistic and has ADHD and a learning disability, needs a kidney transplant to have a chance of life. That was opposed by doctors for a number reasons, including the risk of him pulling out tubes. His mother fought tooth and nail for him to have the chance of a transplant. Last week a high court judge ruled that a transplant was in William’s best interests. It is a story about William but it is also, the family’s lawyers say, a wider one about the medical treatment given to autistic people and people with learning disabilities. For McLennan, the experience has been exhausting. “It has been horrendous, it has been the worst six months of my life,” she said. “You put your trust in doctors because they’re doctors. My advice is just because people are professionals, if you don’t feel it’s right then it’s not right, listen to your gut.” She added: “If I’d have listened to them, William would have been sent home in September and had palliative care, and he would have been dead.” Clinicians say William’s case is complex. But for McLennan it is simple. “He’s got learning difficulties. It is about life, it’s a human right,” she said. Using the phrase used at the court hearing, she added: “If he was a ‘neurotypical’ child, he would already have had a transplant or been on the transplant list.” She said William was the heart and soul of the family home in Lancaster, also shared with dad Will, sister Ruby and puppy Betsy. “He is cheeky,” she said. “He is really kind, he is really helpful. If he can help you, he would do it all day long. He loves power washing, he loves cleaning. I’ve got OCD and he’s getting there. He loves painting walls. He loves going for walks. He loves anything where he can be helpful. “He loves going to school, although he’ll correct me, it’s college. He’s loud. He loves loud music, he loves Michael Jackson, he loves Annie Lennox, he loves Fleetwood Mac.” It is tough bringing up a child who has been dealt the cards William has, but McLennan says she learns every day. “I get up more times than I’m knocked down.” It was William’s 17th birthday in January. “I thought it was going to be his last one so I asked him what he wanted and he wanted a party.” They hired an inflatable nightclub and everyone had a great time. “I really thought it was his last birthday. I look at him sometimes and I just want to cry. He says: ‘What you crying for?’” William was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome, in December 2019. He had home dialysis, which stopped working in September last year, said McLennan. That was when palliative care was first raised. “There was a huge meeting and I begged them to give him a chance. I had to beg … I was crying, I was absolutely heartbroken. I don’t see why I should have had to fight for everything everyone else is entitled to.” Medically and psychologically, William’s case is unquestionably a complex one, with issues over sedation and ventilation. The case was heard at a hearing of the court of protection, which considers cases relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions. The judgment by Mrs Justice Arbuthnot runs to nearly 12,000 words, and references William being big and difficult to manage physically. She talks of her pleasure at meeting William face to face and hearing how he loved kerby – kicking a ball against the kerb. “I noted William’s excitement when describing the game which he clearly enjoyed,” the judge writes. The judge agreed that the care provided for William at Manchester children’s hospital had “clearly been exceptional”. She added: “It was clear from all the evidence that the trust and the clinicians treating William have been agonising over what is in William’s best interests.” The judge said it was “a case of what is the least bad decision for William”. The decision was welcomed by Manchester University NHS foundation trust. Its joint group medical director, Toli Onon, said the case was “unusual, complex and risky”. William’s condition was rare and each treatment option had its own risks to his health and wellbeing, she said. “That’s why we asked the court to make this difficult decision, and why the judge noted that she respected our approach to establishing what’s best for William. “William, his family and our staff have all worked really hard together to support his dialysis; and we will now be liaising with William and his family regarding how best to progress his treatment.” A trust spokesperson said: “We recognise that this is a very difficult time for William and his family and we will continue to support them following the judgment. Our teams are very experienced in caring for children with autism and have supported children with autism, ADHD and learning disabilities through transplants previously. “We reject any allegations of discrimination, and there was no suggestion of this in the court’s judgment, which involved extensive consideration of all of the evidence from William’s family, independent experts and our clinicians.” The road ahead is a fraught one, with the chances of transplant success estimated at 50%. McLennan says she has been buoyed up by the support from other parents of children with learning disabilities. “This hasn’t been about winning,” she said. “It is about what is right. Hopefully it will set a precedent for other cases involving children and adults with learning difficulties.”",News/Society,‘It’s about what is right’: mother’s fight for shot at new kidney for autistic son,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/13/amy-mclennan-mother-fight-kidney-for-autistic-son

3/13/2022,"If someone managed to, hypothetically, avoid pollution, never be involved in an accident and followed all health advice to the letter, how long would they live for? Jane Shaw Please send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Beyond the factors mentioned I think it could also depend to a large extent on circumstances and willpower. Say, for example, that (to take a random imaginary instance) you were extremely rich and determined to thwart your hopeless son’s aspiration to become king, the answer might even be indefinitely. ThereisnoOwl One thing I’ve noticed about very long-lived people is that they remain part of a tightly knit community, and they also remain interested in life. The solutions to a long life, apart from the luck of the genetic draw, may well have more to do with the emotional bonds of community than with pollution. The other point to note is long life and what? There’s no point living to 120 if you’re all crumbly when you get there. So then it’s long life, and good health, and mental alertness, and physical fitness that we’re looking for … which is quite an ask. Lastly, of course, the saddest part of living a long life is everyone you know and love dying. I’ve seen people just give up when a spouse or sibling has died. And to offset that, of course a closely knit community. But in the end, how long would you want to live anyway, by yourself, with no one to giggle at your stupid 90s memes? Mollybee The question assumes that the ageing process is environmentally regulated. While things such as smoking and driving like a loon have obvious disadvantages, ageing is a biological process. The rate at which your telomeres fray, the accumulation of random errors in individual cells’ DNA, and the depletion of stem cells to replace old cell lines play a part in determining your lifespan. Longevity often runs in families, which suggests that inherited factors are involved. I doubt that living the life of a nun is worth the extra few years it may bring anyway. letsbeclearaboutthis The theoretical maximum lifespan for humans is about 150 years. This is related to an evaluation of human resilience – the ability to withstand and recover from disease to maintain a normal physiological equilibrium. A useful parameter for quantifying resilience is the dynamic organism state indicator. Apropos of nothing, it is comical to see the interest in longevity from billionaires. Their detachment from the rest of us seems to inevitably lead to a ludicrous messiah complex. It reveals how completely out of touch these people are and how little they offer. This is not to say scientific interest in ageing is without merit. It is an integral part in many approaches to preventing the onset of age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neuro-degenerative disease. But to achieve an immortal Zuckerberg would hardly be the end goal. Quality, not quantity, is a maxim that can be broadly applied. My view is that it includes the time we spend on Earth. We grow, we age, and we die to make room for the new. That’s it. Self-betterment, close relationships and community are what makes it worthwhile. All the rest is vanity. In my view. Hak_a_dalan Don’t forget the genes (longevity is affected by inheritance) or gender (oldest are generally female). Recorded maximum age seems to be 110-120 years or so, but according to Google, the record is Jeanne Calment (1875–1997) of France, who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days. I would not bet on much over 110 myself even with good luck and a healthy lifestyle. Hilary Gee Much depends on genetic predisposition to disease, perhaps even more so than environmental factors. Live your life in the present, don’t worry about when you’re going to die, life is to be lived, enjoy every moment, try not to abuse your body too much while doing it. WTobiasJr I’m not questioning your sentiment in the matter, and your advice seems sound enough, but what is your epidemiological evidence? Some individuals inherit biological problems which may affect their lifespan, but that doesn’t apply to whole populations. Sickle cell anaemia in west Africa is a well-known exception. Research in Britain dating from the 1970/80s made it quite clear that death rates were related to social class. Recent ONS figures, here reported by the Kings Fund show, that “people living in more affluent areas live significantly longer than people living in deprived areas. In 2017–19, males in the least-deprived 10% of areas in England could expect to live to 83.5 years, almost a decade longer than males in the 10% most-deprived areas (74.1 years).” It’s important that these numbers are pre-pandemic as that has had an effect, but not in terms of making things more equal. The grim reaper has your postcode. Fallowfield If you live like that, avoiding all inflammatory markers such as, well, basically all the fun things in life, you won’t live to be 100, but you’ll feel as if you have. PaulVanSalle My grandmother lived to 107, marbles intact and physically OK until the last year or so. She took up line dancing in her 90s, was usually out if I called in to her care home and was a member of every group in her village for decades. Stay connected, keep learning, be active. Those things. BusyLizzie2 My grandmother on my dad’s side lived to 103. She was antisocial, even towards her own family at times, lived in a care home for the last few years of her life, didn’t mix with the residents, had no interests and no friends. She did have all her marbles, was just about mobile but had a stroke about a week before she died where she was bedridden and totally lost the power of speech. It’s always been a mystery as to how she kept going for so long when she really didn’t appear to enjoy life that much. solentview Bloody-mindedness. Same as with my German gran. nina1414 I have the ambition to reach the age of 131, rather less than 50 years from now. Simple statistics show that very few, if any, people die after that age. It will probably take me until then to achieve all things I ever wanted to do. Something to look forward to. Sounds good to me. After that, I wouldn’t mind dying in bed, not necessarily shot by a jealous husband. Raimoh105 People tend to forget that living to a great age just means they’re likely to be old and decrepit for longer. betweencloudshadows The recent research (published on Science) showed that a small reduction of food intake (14%) could significantly improve immune response and reduce chances of inflammation as well as losing weight. This was based on a two-year random study of healthy adults. The implication seems it could prolong healthy span of life in humans (as well as in mice already proven). Hillside “Millions long for immortality who don’t know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon.” Susan Ertz. Having an uncle who lived to be 100 and a mother who just celebrated her 95th, having a close family who live with you or nearby really helps living to an old age. And being generally healthy. JohnInAthlone Communities in Chernobyl were forced to evacuate in 1986 … but some refused to leave. It turned out that those who were removed suffered terribly and couldn’t settle down, and in many, if not most cases, were outlived by those who insisted on staying put in their communities in the Chernobyl area. Having a sense of meaning and a sense of belonging seems to be the important factor in this. wetsuitboots Troy: “Who wants to live to be 89?”Barnaby: “Someone who’s 88.” Inoubliable Jeanne Calment lived to 122 and we can assume that’s about the natural limit, give or take a year, without some kind of external therapy to halt or reverse senescence – which may not be far off. Modern medicine probably won’t extend that extreme but just bring the rest of us closer to it, and in better health to the very end rather than in an extended decrepitude. It’s hard to know the ideal “recipe” for longevity though; it’s probably person-specific and it may be the degree of exposure of one factor (eg alcohol, pollutants, virii) to one person is negative, but to another their body pushes against and makes them more robust in the long run. HaveYouFedTheFish Thus far the answer is 120-something, and only a tiny fraction of a percentage of people will achieve that. There’s little or no evolutionary selection for extreme old age. People who live a really long time past the age of reproduction are effectively rolling the dice and getting double six again and again. As the question implies you can load the dice in your favour by following medical advice, but some time before your 125th birthday some irreplaceable part of your body will stop working, and then so will you. In the future things may be different, because we will probably become much better at maintaining and repairing our bodies and brains. This will increase the percentage of people who make it past 120, and perhaps allow some to live decades longer. Those who do so will have to work at it – a lifelong regimen of diet, exercise and medication. I don’t know if I want to work that hard. There is reasonable evidence that calorie restriction extends mammalian lifespans. One hundred and forty years, all of it quite hungry? That sounds like a really long time. SemiFunctional Sardinia has plenty of centenarians – and they drink a drop of wine each day, just a drop. By the way, if we ultimately aim at “eternal life’,” we should remember that Tithonus, in Greek mythology, was sentenced to this as a punishment. Bloreheath How long would anybody live? On average, not a lot longer than they do now. What shortens life significantly is low income. To which we can add a few particularly hazardous habits, such as smoking, or hazardous occupations. If you’re living in a developed country with a better than average income, not smoking, and a few potentially fatal diseases can be controlled, your life expectancy is not far off the hypothetical maximum as far as current medical practice sees it. Most of the aims of current health policy are about addressing “premature” deaths, essentially treating identifiable causes that shorten life. It’s not about extending life for all, that is not seen as a practical aim. The question in the headline is about possible lifespan (which doesn’t appear to be what was asked), that’s luck. There are combinations of genes, lifestyle, environment, but mostly chance, that allow some individuals to live to near 120 years. The trick is the combination is so rare it’s not obvious what makes those factors any different from conditions that are merely “good”. The extremely long lived are outliers; any normal distribution will throw up a few individuals at the extremes of the curve. The shortest lived are lost among the “accidents” and a disease toll that takes a percentage at all ages. The longest lived, however, and whatever circumstances those few need, are clearly becoming seen more frequently. At time of writing, the third- and fourth-longest lived individuals ever are still alive. Perhaps more remarkable is that of the 100 authenticated longest lived women, and the 100 longest lived men ever, only one died before 1985 and more than 80% of them were still living into the year 2000 and beyond. leadballoon",News/Science,Readers reply: how long could a person possibly live?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/13/readers-reply-how-long-could-a-person-possibly-live
3/13/2022,"A woman was killed when a bus carrying Ukrainian refugees overturned on a motorway in Italy on Sunday morning. The 32-year-old and her two children, aged 10 and five, were among 22 people onboard escaping the war in Ukraine, according to reports in the Italian press. The bus was making its way from Ukraine to Pescara, a port city in Abruzzo, when it skidded and overturned on a grassy slope beside the A14 motorway at about 6.30am. The woman died at the scene and her children were taking to Bufalini hospital with bruises. They have been hospitalised as doctors give them psychological support. No injuries were reported among the other passengers. Emergency services used two mobile cranes to turn the bus upright. The cause of the accident is not yet known. As of Saturday almost 35,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in Italy, most of them women and children. Italy’s interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, told Corriere della Sera on Friday that most were staying with family and friends. She said 283 properties seized from the mafia had been identified to accommodate people over the longer term. Refugees will be given access to healthcare, children will be schooled and adults given permits to work. Italy is managing the process as part of the EU’s temporary protection directive, an instrument drawn up in 2001 and activated this month, which allows member states to give immediate protection to Ukrainian refugees.",News/World news,Woman fleeing Ukraine war dies in bus crash in Italy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/woman-fleeing-ukraine-war-dies-in-bus-crash-in-italy
3/13/2022,"The former UN secretary general has warned the UK against fracking, as the world stands at a “dangerous” point in the climate crisis, brought on by the invasion of Ukraine. Ban Ki-moon, now deputy chair of the Elders group of former world statespeople and public figures, said countries faced stark choices as a result of the Ukraine war and energy crisis, and must embrace renewable energy instead of returning to fossil fuels. “I think it’s dangerous – just look at the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report,” he said, referring to the latest warning from scientists last month. “There is no time for us to lose. Even under normal conditions [before the Ukraine war] we were far behind the pace.” He called on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to end the war. “President Putin, if he is a man of global vision, or humanity, or compassion, he must stop. Whatever grievances he may have and concerns he may have, he can negotiate later rather than killing people.” He warned that the Ukraine war, as well as being “outrageous in the 21st century”, would have an impact on the climate crisis. Governments should not try to secure greater supplies of fossil fuels, he urged, as they sought alternatives to imports of Russian oil and gas, on which the EU, the US and the UK have now placed restrictions. “This [war] will impact the international community’s effort to address climate issues, and the pandemic issues,” he said in an interview. “I am concerned that some European countries are even now considering how to address oil and energy shortages [by seeking] exports of some other [sources of] gas or oil. In the UK, there is some idea of releasing the ban on fracking. These are very short term, unproductive ideas.” Fracking in the UK would be “not a good idea”, he added. “It’s very short term gain that will lose the long term interest of humanity. I hope the politicians have some longer vision for the benefit of the whole world.” The UK government signalled this week that fracking was still a possibility, though an unlikely one. Ministers have come under pressure to back fracking, from some backbenchers and sections of the media, even though it is unlikely to be economically viable and would do nothing to ease the current crisis as it would take years to produce any gas. Meanwhile, the EU set out plans last week to cut dependency on Russian oil and gas by two-thirds by the end of this year. Some of the slack will be taken up by seeking other suppliers, such as shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and by an expansion of renewable energy and push for greater energy efficiency. But expanding domestic fossil fuels, such as coal, may also be seen as a possibility if Vladimir Putin goes further and cuts off more supplies to Europe. Ban said that Germany, which has been phasing out coal, should not return to fossil fuels: “Germany is the biggest economic power in Europe – they should take this as a kind of short term political gain.” Ban also urged countries to consider nuclear energy, which he said would be a “wise choice”. He said: “There has been some debate and controversy on whether to use nuclear energy or not. But if we use a good energy mix, with renewable energy, nuclear energy and other clean sources of energy, that’s the way we can meet the target of carbon neutrality … We have to use nuclear energy.” The war in Ukraine would affect preparations for Cop27, the next UN climate summit, set to take place in Egypt this November, he warned. “This is an issue for humanity and our planet Earth. This has nothing to do with politics,” said Ban. “But in reality this may be affected [by the war in Ukraine].” Ban visited the UK on Friday to give a lecture at Oxford University and speak to Alok Sharma, the UK president of Cop26 who will continue to lead the UN negotiations until this November, but their meeting had to take place online because Sharma has contracted Covid-19. Ban urged rich countries to prepare for Cop27 by providing more financial assistance to developing world governments to adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, such as extreme weather, droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises. “World leaders should really feel a sense of global responsibility, global justice and global humanity, and a sense of compassion for those people [affected by climate breakdown],” he said. “We have to listen to the recommendations of the IPCC and the scientists. It’s much more important than politics,” he said. Ban also said he was angry at countries’ handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in its early stages, seeing a “lack of multilateralism” in the approach countries took after the outbreak was confirmed. He was also scathing about the role of the World Bank in the pandemic, saying it had not done enough. “This is a serious issue, this is a lack of multilateralism. So I am, as a former secretary general, really angry that we should suffer like this, because the initial preventive measures have not been taken properly,” he said.",News/Environment,‘Fracking is dangerous’: Ban Ki-moon warns UK government over climate commitments ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/13/fracking-is-dangerous-ban-ki-moon-warns-uk-government-over-climate-commitments
3/13/2022,"Given the political history of the Belarus Free Theatre and its overt references to the war in Ukraine in this production, Dogs of Europe cannot be seen as theatre alone. It is art, activism and theatrical disruption, at once. Having been performed clandestinely in garages and warehouses in Minsk, it feels released on this large-scale stage. Like a genie escaping from a bottle, there is a magnificent eruption of sound and spectacle. Big, haunting, discordant songs and music by Mark and Marichka Marczyk of Balaklava Blues expand to fill the auditorium. Maria Sazonova’s choreography is arresting in its acrobatic drama, with movements like orchestrated military exercises or assaults, and containing a fierce, fulminating physicality. A back screen for projections (with video design by Richard Williamson) begins as a roving camera from a computer game, which gives the show an unstable, lurching quality and seems designed to discombobulate its audience. Every member of the ensemble has spent time in jail and their orchestrated movements play out street protests, battles, rape and murder. Inert bodies are dragged off stage, time and again. Deliberately cartoonish violence shows characters shot at point-blank range and bouncing back up. Based on a dystopian novel by Alhierd Bacharevic which is banned in Belarus, the story moves from 2019 to 2049 and depicts a world in which Russia has taken over several countries to become a dictatorial superstate. There is a clear sense of a connected landmass that underlines the fact that Belarus – and Ukraine – are not separate geographic entities under siege but part of the observing world around them. The script is characteristically meandering, with scenes that appear more like a series of skits. Surtitles display a stream of words, barely stopping for breath. Fairytale imagery is mixed with absurdist humour and oblique dialogue which has the disjointed sense of a fever dream. These elements feel like disruptions – mirroring the illogicality of dictatorships – but the overall effect is breathtaking in spectacle and full of a gruelling tedium, designed to frustrate and defy logic. The end of the drama segues into a postscript about Ukraine with a direct address from Natalia Kaliada (who directs alongside Nicolai Khalezin) about what Britain could – and should – be doing in response. Like the show itself, it feels like an urgent, enraged, frustrating and necessary affront.",Arts/Stage,Dogs of Europe review – art and activism combine in breathtaking spectacle,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/13/dogs-of-europe-review-barbican-london-free-belarus-theatre
