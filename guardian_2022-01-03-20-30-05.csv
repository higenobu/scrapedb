1/3/2022,"Throughout 2021, American workers stood up and fought back to an unusual degree. Workers went on strike at Kellogg’s, Nabisco, John Deere, Columbia University and numerous hospitals, while non-union “essential” workers – furious about how they’ve been treated – walked out at supermarkets, warehouses and fast-food restaurants. Workers have sought to unionize at Starbucks, Amazon, even the Art Institute of Chicago. And a record number of Americans have been quitting their jobs each month, more than 4 million monthly, fed up and eager for something better. Millions of workers are angry – angry that they didn’t get hazard pay for risking their lives during the pandemic, angry that they’ve been forced to work 70 or 80 hours a week, angry that they received puny raises while executive pay soared, angry that they didn’t get paid sick days when they got sick.  Out of this comes a question that looms large for America’s workers: will this surge of worker action and anger be a mere flash in the pan or will it be part of a longer-lasting phenomenon? The answer to this important question could turn on whether all this anger and energy are somehow transformed into a larger movement. At least for now, America’s labor leaders seem to be doing very little to tap all this energy and hope and to build it into something bigger and longer lasting. Yes, we are seeing unionization drives at this workplace and that one, but we are not seeing any bigger, broader effort to channel and transform all this worker energy and discontent into a new movement, one perhaps with millions of engaged and energetic nonunion workers, that would work in conjunction with the traditional union movement. Worker advocates I speak to keep wondering: what are labor leaders waiting for? If not now, when? In Joe Biden, we have the most pro-union president since Franklin Roosevelt, and public approval for unions is the highest it’s been in more than a half century. For decades, union leaders have said they are eager to reverse labor’s long decline – more than 20% of workers were in unions three decades ago, now just 10% are. Unless unions step up and do something bold, they’ll relegate themselves to continued decline. Many labor leaders evidently think it’s impossible or improbable to turn this year’s energy and anger into a new movement or a big, new group. But building a movement from scratch isn’t impossible. 350.org was founded in 2008 by several college students and environmentalist author Bill McKibben, and within two years, it organized a mammoth Day of Climate Action with a reported 5,245 actions in 181 countries. After the horrific shootings at Marjorie Stoneman high school in Florida in 2018, a handful of students founded March for Our Lives, and within five weeks, their group had organized nationwide rallies with hundreds of thousands of people calling for gun control. Black Lives Matter also grew into a powerful national movement within a few years. None of these movements were one-shot or one-month affairs – they have become powers to contend with in policy and politics. So why isn’t the labor movement seizing on this year’s burst of worker energy to build something bigger? I was discussing this with friend who is a professor of labor studies, and she said she thought that most of today’s union leaders were “constitutionally incapable” of building big or being bold and ambitious. She said that after decades of being on the defensive, of being beaten down by hostile corporations, hostile GOP lawmakers and hostile judicial decisions, many labor leaders seem unable to dream big or think outside the box on how to attract large numbers of workers in ways beyond the traditional one-workplace-at-a-time union drives. But building big and outside the box isn’t impossible for labor. Just look at the Fight for $15. The strategists and SEIU leaders behind it had a vision: they wanted to push the issue of low wages into the national conversation and lift the pay floor for millions of workers. They started small, with walkouts by 200 workers at a dozen fast-food restaurants in New York City, and within two years, they built a powerful national movement that held strikes and protests in hundreds of cities. This movement ultimately got a dozen states to enact a $15 minimum wage, lifting pay for over 20 million workers. Perhaps some brilliant, visionary workers or worker advocates will step forward to seek to channel this year’s burst of worker anger and energy into a new movement. Social media could certainly help build it, perhaps with the assistance of groups like Coworker.org, which has considerable experience engaging and mobilizing disgruntled rank-and-file workers via the internet. For many workers, a big new group or movement could be a waystation toward unionizing: helping educate and mobilize workers to unionize, guiding them on next steps and what their rights are, and promising a pool of ready support if they seek to unionize. This new group or movement could send out bulletins telling members how they could help other workers in their community or nearby communities – perhaps help unionization drives at Amazon or Starbucks or strikers at Kellogg’s or Warrior Met Coal in Alabama or food delivery workers who are cheated out of tips and don’t have access to bathrooms. Members of this new group could be called on to protest outside the offices of members of Congress or state lawmakers about myriad issues, perhaps raising the federal minimum wage or enacting paid family leave or the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. Or they could join rallies for voting rights or immigrant rights or against police abuses or to combat global warming. Working America, an arm of the AFL-CIO, does some of this, mainly urging its members to vote and to contact lawmakers. To truly help reverse labor’s decline and capitalize on today’s worker anger, much more will be needed – an organization that is far more connected to workers and does far more organizing, protesting and mobilizing. America’s labor movement is terribly balkanized, with many unions engaged in turf battles and upset that another union has (perhaps) stepped into its territory. As a result, they too often find it hard to work together. But if America’s unions are serious about wanting to strengthen worker power and reverse labor’s decline, it’s time to put past divisions behind them and figure out how to build back something bigger. There are three main reasons that America’s labor movement has declined: first, corporate America’s fierce resistance to unions, second, the decades-long slide in factory jobs, and, third, the Republican party’s decades-long fight to weaken unions and make it tougher to unionize. But there’s another factor behind labor’s decline that is rarely discussed – many labor leaders don’t do nearly enough to inspire workers and expand the union movement. Today’s workers could use some vigorous, visionary leaders like Mother Jones, Sidney Hillman, John L Lewis and A Philip Randolph to lead and inspire, and build something bigger. Perhaps many union leaders haven’t been hearing what I often hear from rank-and-file union members: “Lead or get out of the way.” Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace.

1/3/2022,"It was fascinating to see lentils growing on low plants, protected by bean-sized green pods. We were in a field in the middle of Sicily, and there were chickpeas growing, too, also in neat green jackets, and in the next field wheat. It was June and the sun was high and hot, but it had rained the night before, so our ankles were warmed by steam. We had been told to wear sensible shoes, and I was wearing clogs; sensible, but not in a field. So while I tried to listen to Francesco Di Gesu explain how the lentils grown on his land would be harvested, thrashed and dried, I was distracted by the way my feet were collecting the clay earth. Not a normal amount, but massive, ever-increasing clumps, which made my legs look like uprooted tree trunks and walking harder and harder, until eventually I lost one and got stuck in the other; part stork, part adult version of a childhood game.  After pointing and laughing, someone came to my aid and we used a stick to lever off some earth; I managed to stomp off more on the way to the van. Later, back where we had come from, I sat and scraped away the rest of the now dry mud, and with it dozens of lentils, a memory now relived every time I tip a bag of them into a pan and cover with water. You are, most likely, reading this in early January, so happy new year. Maybe you ate lentils last night, their coin shape an augury of wealth and happiness for this coming year. Or maybe you ate a grape every time the clock struck or iPhone beeped down to midnight – that, too, is said to ensure a secure and comfortable tomorrow. If you didn’t, here is a recipe that includes both, about which I can’t promise anything (although I am always optimistic), except for its goodness. Most of the time I braise lentils, cooking them in just enough water that by the end it is almost completely absorbed and the final consistency soft. For this dish, however, while the lentils should be completely cooked and tender, I don’t want them to collapse, so I boil them in well-seasoned water, then drain. The cooking time of lentils depends on their variety, and on how old they are and how they have been stored, so, as always, keep tasting. This is a recipe that lends itself to variations. The cheese could be replaced with hard-boiled eggs and anchovy fillets, sausages or roast red peppers. That said, I do suggest trying it with the goat’s cheese – its creamy sharpness is terrific with the sweet-earthy lentils. Most herbs can be stirred into warm lentils, as can lightly toasted cumin seeds or crushed coriander; you could even stir in a handful of cooked chestnuts, toasted hazelnuts or ribbons of radicchio. Or spoon the lentils on radicchio leaf-boats, ready to sail into 2022.

While the lentils are cooking, put the grapes on a small baking tray, pour over some oil, sprinkle with salt, add the marjoram, and toss. Bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20 minutes, until soft and blistered, then pull from oven, put the cheese on top and return to the oven for five minutes, until the cheese is warm. Drain the lentils, then put them in a bowl and toss with three tablespoons olive oil, salt, lots of black pepper, the red-wine vinegar and parsley.

1/3/2022,"In 2020, an environmental non-profit returned over a dozen acres in Oregon to the Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes. Two months later, a conservation group worked with the Esselen Tribe of Monterey County to return more than 1,000 acres in California to the tribal group.  And then late last year, in one of the largest transfers of its kind, an environmental organization returned thousands of acres of wildlife rangeland in Washington state to the Colville Tribes. Although each agreement was distinct, in recent years an important pattern has emerged of conservationists and Indigenous people working together by way of land transfers. The effect has been twofold: protecting ecologically vital spaces while helping to right historic injustices by returning properties to their original caretakers. This agreement in October was about 9,243 acres of arid grasslands, dotted with sagebrush, that encompass several canyons in north central Washington state that are valued by biologists as a key corridor linking the Cascade mountain range to the Rocky mountains for lynx, wolverine, wolves and grizzly bears. It was traditional territory of the Okanagan Tribe, a First Nations and Native American people who spanned across the Canada-US border, and it was part of the original Colville Tribes’ reservation that was stripped away by the federal government in 1892 after gold was discovered. In recent decades, it has been used as a family ranch. But then when it emerged in recent years that the land would be put up for sale, the environmental non-profit Conservation Northwest attempted to try and get it into the hands of a buyer who would preserve it. However, according to the non-profit’s executive director, Mitch Friedman, these efforts were continually unsuccessful. Toward the end of last year the land’s ecological and historical elements seemed to align perfectly when tribal officials and the non-profit’s leaders worked to return it to the hands of the Colville Tribes. “It was, I would say, the best kind of news that we could receive, to get land back,” said Andy Joseph, Jr, chairman of the Colville Business Council, who described stepping back onto the land in late October for a ceremony as a feeling of returning home. The community, which consists of 12 bands, is known for its substantial natural resources departments and had previously worked closely with Conservation Northwest, most recently to relocate threatened Canada lynx on the reservation. In early October, after Conservation Northwest fundraised about $4.6m in eight months to purchase the property, and the tribe approved a protective covenant that outlined protections on the land, the group immediately transferred the land’s deed to the Colville Tribes. Although Indigenous peoples only make up about 5% of the world’s population, their territories encompass 80% of global biodiversity, according to the 2020 report The Indigenous World. And nature on Indigenous peoples’ lands is “generally declining less rapidly” than other land, according to a 2019 report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Today, it’s clear conservationists have been looking to traditional ecological knowledge in their work. At the same time, environmental organizations and tribes have been coming together to protect the natural world, and a key part of this teamwork has been land transfers. In September, the Nature Conservancy transferred the 132-acre Safe Harbor Marsh Preserve along the west shore of Flathead Lake to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana. The Indigenous community has a large natural resources department and developed a strong relationship with the environmental organization. They also have a long history with the preserve. Once a part of the tribe’s reservation, the marsh had been lost, along with thousands of other acres, through a pair of federal allotment acts in the early 1900’s. Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said they had made it a point to try to buy ​​these properties back, but faced challenges with skyrocketing costs. She said they were extremely happy when the Nature Conservancy leaders approached them about the marsh. “It’s just so amazing and, you know, really heartwarming that we have allies that understand us. They understand what our goals are, you know, in the big picture,” she said. “It’s not about money; it’s not about making a profit or capitalism or development. It’s about conserving it for future generations, so that our descendants can enjoy that.” The tribe passed a resolution specifying that the site will be dedicated to conservation, wildlife and cultural uses. Chairwoman Fyant explained that they’re working to integrate it into their management plan and to preserve the marsh for the waterfowl and other migratory birds. But at the same time, tribes are in no way a monolithic group. And there have been instances of Indigenous communities’ work running afoul of conservation efforts. The Navajo Nation Council, for example, recently spoke out in opposition of the Biden administration’s proposed ban on oil and gas drilling around Chaco Canyon. At the same time, the Makah Tribe has spent years working to regain its whaling rights, which has put them at odds with several conservation groups. Jill Sherman-Warne, executive director of the Native American Environmental Protection Coalition and former elected official of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, explained that given all of the ignored treaties and other agreements cast aside, tribes have been left to take care of themselves. And in some cases that may mean logging, gaming, tourism or other practices that don’t necessarily align with conservation. But overall, she said, tribes are incredibly effective protectors of the natural world. “Tribal people have in their histories knowledge that before geologists or hydrologists can prove scientific fact,” she said. “Tribes have stories about the environment that existed before any of the science, which now is proving their oral histories to be true.” Serra Hoagland, a biologist and tribal liaison for the US Forest Service, said that traditional ecological knowledge and western science can complement each other very well. Citing a 2012 Journal of Forestry study, she explained that while western science tends to be more concrete and look in short time periods, traditional knowledge is often more abstract and looks in longer time periods. “You commonly hear throughout Indian Country, tribes and Native people talking about the seventh generation,” said Hoagland, a Member of Pueblo of Laguna. “And that’s because we’re thinking that far ahead into the future about our decisions that we’re making today.” Today, officials within the Confederated Tribes of the Colville reservation have started putting together a conservation management plan guided by traditional knowledge and western science for the recently returned land. Cody Desautel, natural resources division director for the Colville Tribes, said the process will probably take about six months and involve examining the species on the property, the condition of the land and the types of improvements that may need to be made. One of the species he said he anticipates being a priority is endangered sharp-tailed grouse, which are known to have breeding grounds on the land. The Colville Tribes also plans to conduct a cultural plant inventory to identify those culturally significant to the tribe. They may also be seeing two additional pieces of land returned in the coming months. The Methow Conservancy recently purchased more than 300 acres and has announced its plans to give it to the tribe. And after Conservation Northwest was able to raise about $300,000 over the amount needed for the previously returned land, they plan to help the tribe with closing costs on another property within that same corridor. Chairman Joseph said given the importance of returning land and their shared caretaking goals, he hopes to see others follow suit. He explained that it is their traditional and cultural belief that “as long as we take care of the land, the animals, the foods, the medicines and the water, they’ll always be here for us”. “It seems like the conservationists feel the same way.”",News/US news,Original caretakers: Indigenous groups team up with conservationists to protect swaths of US ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/original-caretakers-indigenous-groups-team-up-with-conservationists-to-protect-swaths-of-us
1/3/2022,"As Shaka Senghor was serving 19 years in prison for murder, a letter from his father gave him the strength to endure and eventually reform. “I’ll never leave your side,” Senghor’s father wrote to him, after Senghor told his family, in a letter written from solitary confinement, that they should move on with their lives without him. Senghor explored his road to redemption in his New York Times best-seller Writing My Wrongs: Life, Death, and Redemption in an American Prison. At 19, Senghor was convicted of second degree murder after shooting a man during a drug deal in Detroit. He was released from prison in 2010 and since then has been a MIT Media Lab Director’s Fellow, delivered a TED Talk in 2016 that has collected more than 1.6m views and been featured on Oprah Winfrey’s SuperSoul 100.  Now, in his second book titled Letters to the Sons of Society, which will be published later this month, Senghor has written a collection of letters to his two sons: Jay, who was born while he was in prison, with whom he had a distant and fractured relationship, and his younger charge, Sekou, who was born to a wiser, redeemed Senghor who was able to be a present and attentive father. In his book, Senghor, 49, wrestles with reconciling and building a relationship with his adult son who first knew him as an inmate, and his second child, born of a different mother, who is being raised by an accomplished and liberated man. Senghor grapples with his regret over missing out on so much of his eldest son’s life, battles with his own toxic ideas of masculinity and ultimately works to find a way to love both his children and engage in their lives authentically. Letters played a big role in your own redemption and transformation. Why did you decide to write this book in the form of letters versus other narrative styles? My transformation really started with letters from my dad. He is a beautiful letter writer and he would write me five to six page handwritten letters about life. We did a lot of healing and growing together and challenging ideas through our letters. And in my toughest moments in prison, I would go back and reread his letters as a reminder that there was someone on the other side of the four walls who really cared about me. Someone who loved me, loved me unconditionally. Through our letters, we were able to really be honest and very transparent with each other. He could admit the areas where he felt he came up short and I could accept my failures and be accountable and free him from the oppressive thought that it was his fault I landed in prison. I felt like the intimacy of the letters between my dad and I were something we just don’t see: an honest and emotional exchange between Black men. I thought, if I could ever write something to my sons that they could go back to, the way I went back to the letters with my dad, their lives would be good. You wrote Letters during a nine month period in 2020, during the pandemic constraints and a moment of racial uprisings and reckonings. How did that timing influence your approach? When I began to put the letters together, it was before the social unrest we witnessed globally. When I put my first proposal together, it was in late 2019, I was thinking about the narrative around Black men and this negative story that kept being told. We’re framed like we are America’s problem; we’re the Black community’s problem; we’re Black women’s problems; we’re everybody’s problem and nobody’s solution. It really bothered me because I know so many incredible Black men. Originally the letters were going to be addressed to different sons: my hip-hop sons, my non-binary confirming sons, my entrepreneurial sons. Then as I thought about it, I thought, “I need to write these letters to my sons because between these two worlds are the many sons I encounter.” Your oldest son, Jay, is 29 and your youngest, Sekou, is 10. How have they responded to what you’ve written? Jay does not want to read the book. He is so nonchalant and in his own world. I realized that I can’t insert myself into his life in a way that he hasn’t given me permission to do. So I make the offering, and whatever he chooses to do, I’m cool with. With Sekou, it’s different because some of the content is more mature than where he is at. He did read some and had the best reaction ever. He was so amused that my dad once bought me some fake Jordan (sneakers). He was just like, “Not the Pro Wings.” It was a special moment. Do you see this book as a parenting guide for Black boys? Or do you expect it to have a wider resonance? This is a book that white fathers and sons should consume, too. Oftentimes they are in those positions that are systemically oppressive to people who don’t look like them. It’s really important for white dads to understand that Black fathers want the same things for their sons: safety, well-being, the ability to thrive and not just survive. The biggest thing I want (all) to take away is the power of love – the emotional accessibility that we owe ourselves and owe our sons and how impactful it is when you can open up. Love is truly our power and is the source of all things great. You wrote a letter unpacking isolation and you draw a parallel between being in solitary confinement in prison and the isolation of the early days of the pandemic. What took you there? When the global pandemic first began and people started going into lockdown, I saw a lot of people struggling. Whenever people would reach out to me, they’d say I feel bad because you dealt with real isolation going through solitary confinement. And I’d say: “No, this is real. There is not a comparison to make, but there are similar themes.” In solitary what really challenges you is this indefinite sense of not knowing. There’s never a concrete time frame of when you’ll be out. It was the same with this pandemic – we don’t know when we are coming out of it. The depression that set in for many people was familiar territory to me. I remember one day, I was in my office and was getting off my fifth Zoom meeting. I had ordered food in. I felt a sense of the room closing in on me. I realized I was triggered and my mind had gone back to a previous experience – my prison experience. It felt just like when they would bring your food to the cell. And this is where you’ll be and you can’t go anywhere. And so I had to leave, to remember, I can get out of here. Isolation happens in many forms. You spent about seven years combined in solitary confinement for various reasons and during that time found meditation, discipline and hope. I remember writing to my dad and telling him I think I’m going to die in this place and they are never going to let me out. I want you to go on with your life and take care of Jay and the family. I wrote him an honest letter because I thought my life was over and I didn’t want to see him suffer as a result of my suffering. My dad wrote me back and told me that while he wished I wasn’t in solitary confinement he had no judgment. He told me that no matter how long I was in prison he wouldn’t leave my side and would always have my back. I read the letter so many times because it affirmed me and kept me strong on so many days. You write about trauma, abuse, alcohol and drug addiction, among other serious topics. Why did you want to broach these issues with your still young sons? Prison is designed to lay you bare. It dehumanizes you in such a way and it strips you. Once you reconcile that, you can live with any truth. There are conversations that our community does not have with children. There is this old model … and we tiptoe around a lot of topics. I’m a parent, a dad and I mentor kids all over the country. I go into these schools and these 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, they are watching everything on social media. Their conversations are hyper-mature but in a very toxic way. My responsibility is to empower my sons with my truth and that truth comes through my own vulnerability. Because I have a public life and I’ve been convicted of a very serious crime … kids could say things to my youngest son. I had a fear that someone could say to him, “your dad is a murderer”, without him having any context it would hurt him. So for me, the responsible thing to do is to speak the truth. I want to be real with both of them. [They] already know the worst thing I’ve done in my life. So for me, the rest of the topics are not hard conversations to have. What does a whole Black boy look like to you? When I think of a whole Black boy the first thing that comes to mind is an image of Sekou dancing to old-school soul music. I imagine a boy who is full of joy and that is able to explore the world with curiosity and be unimpeded in his quest to learn, to have fun, to contribute, to have agency over his body and thoughts. To be able to give love and receive love without it being filtered through a lens of trauma or skepticism. To really smile freely, smile in a way that makes other people smile when they walk in the room. Somebody that can express themselves and has full access to their emotions. There’s nothing more beautiful than when my son comes up to me and says he needs a hug. He’s so funny to me – he says: “Dad bring it in, bring it in.” That freedom of emotional access, that is wholeness to me.",News/World news,‘I’ll never leave your side’: his father’s letters helped him endure 19 years in prison,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/shaka-senghor-letters-sons
1/3/2022,"Thomas Tuchel used to be about control. When he arrived at Chelsea a year ago, that was what he brought: suddenly a team that had been desperately vulnerable on the break stopped conceding on the counter. They held the ball and the 3-4-2-1 gave them a natural defensive structure with two midfielders stationed in front of the defensive line. They won the Champions League because they showed how it was possible to play pressing football without leaving yourself open in transition. That had always been Manchester City’s issue, less in the Premier League (although teams such as Leicester have often troubled them, as they did last week even in conceding six) than against top European sides. They were a remorseless attacking force, as imposing as the Death Star, but they also had that fatal exhaust port that meant they could be destroyed. To an extent that is intrinsic to the philosophy: push high and of course there will be space behind the defensive line; the question was how to guard against balls played into that space without losing the aggression of the press.  City have clearly worked on that. Even in possession they often have five men behind the ball. They are more measured in their approach now than they were when Pep Guardiola first arrived in England. But it was Tuchel’s Chelsea who seemed to have found the balance, beating City three times in the final seven weeks of the season, including in the FA Cup semi-final and the Champions League final. But while City march on, only 10 points dropped in the league this season, Chelsea have lost that sense of control. Having conceded four goals in their first 12 league games of the season, they’ve conceded 12 in the past nine, with only one clean sheet. Their form has been far from disastrous: they have lost only one of those games, but equally they have won only three. And as so often, once the rot sets in, it spreads rapidly. Romelu Lukaku, having suggested he was unhappy with the 3-4-2-1 to which Tuchel has returned, will have further talks with the management on Monday. That is significant not only because he cost £97.5m and ideally wouldn’t be talking about how he pines for Inter eight league starts after leaving them, but because he seemed the solution to the slight toothlessness that was the only real doubt towards the end of last season. Not only is he a habitual goalscorer – only once in the past 12 seasons has he failed to get into double figures – but he is a player whose movement seemed ideal for Chelsea: why wouldn’t the same drift out to the right to create space for Kevin De Bruyne that has worked so well for Belgium work also with Chelsea’s inside-forwards? But as he has struggled to make a consistent impact, so Chelsea’s entire forward line has come under scrutiny: £71m for Kai Havertz, £58m for Christian Pulisic, £47.5m for Timo Werner, £34m for Hakim Ziyech … some have suffered injury or illness and some or all may yet come good, but that’s £308m on five players over two and half seasons, none of whom could be said to have yet been a resounding success. Chelsea’s leading scorer in the league last season was Jorginho; this season it is Mason Mount. Tuchel arrived with a reputation for prickliness, as somebody with a tendency to fall out with players, directors and journalists eventually, but for most of the past year has been drily charming. Only in the last weeks has that begun to change, the Lukaku interview and its fallout the first real sign of tension with his squad. Resolving that situation feels vital, not only because Chelsea need a Lukaku figure scoring goals and leading the line, but because the history of Chelsea managers who cannot accommodate big signings is not good. But everything, ultimately, comes back to that loss of control. It didn’t matter that Chelsea’s wing-backs had scored more than their forwards when they were keeping clean sheets; the grumbling of a high-profile player matters less when you are winning games. The loss of Mateo Kovacic, first to a hamstring injury and then to Covid, has been hugely costly: Chelsea have conceded only four goals in his 10 league starts this season and three of those have come in the past two games when, Tuchel has acknowledged, he was rushed back. His absence, and N’Golo Kanté’s ongoing struggles with a knee injury, have increased the pressure on Jorginho, who has at times looked distinctly weary, notably in the defeat at West Ham. The deadline-day loan signing of Saúl Ñíguez, who has managed a total of 164 league minutes for Chelsea, has not worked out, and Ross Barkley, 154 league minutes this season, surely has no future at the club. Injuries have also played havoc in the back five, with Reece James and Ben Chilwell particular losses. But there is also self-inflicted uncertainty, with Antonio Rüdiger, Thiago Silva and Andreas Christensen out of contract in the summer. After announcing losses of £145.6m last week, a squad that last season seemed vibrant, ready for years of domination, has somehow come to look fragile. Which just goes to show how rapidly things can spin out of control. The loss of the attribute that defined Chelsea in the second half of last season is now threatening to undermine the whole project. Sorting out Lukaku may be the priority, but Chelsea also have to get that sense of control back.",Sport/Football,Lukaku issue looms large but Chelsea are really suffering for loss of control | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/romelu-lukaku-issue-chelsea-suffering-loss-of-control-thomas-tuchel

Is that how Ukrainians are seen abroad?”  Media in Ukraine confirmed that he has sent a letter to the streaming giant to complain about the portrayal of Petra, played by actor Daria Panchenko, who is terrified of being deported in the show, shoplifts while on a shopping spree with Emily and has bad fashion sense – the ultimate faux pas in this appearance-obsessed world. Emily in Paris is about the titular American, played by Lily Collins, who moves to the city of light to work for a marketing firm and swiftly becomes an influencer. This is far from the first time the show has been blasted for cliched and stereotypical depictions – in fact, it has become renowned for its beret-wearing, chain-smoking and philandering French characters. The Guardian review of its debut series declared it “astonishingly tone-deaf”, adding: “You name a stereotype, and within the first three episodes, Emily has not only encountered it, but tried to rectify it, to adjust it to the American way.” French critic Charles Martin, who writes for Première, was irate. “Frankly, watching Emily in Paris there’s plenty to feel insulted about. When they decided to caricature us, the authors didn’t hold back … no cliche is spared, not even the weakest.” In an interview with Elle UK in December, Collins declared that the show was seeking to correct some of the perceived errors in its second run, stating that it would be “more inclusive and diverse” as a result. Collins said: “For me as Emily, but also as a producer, after season one, hearing people’s thoughts, concerns, questions, likes, dislikes, just feelings about it, there were certain things that spoke to the time that we’re living in and what is right, moral and correct and should be done. I wanted diversity and inclusion in front of and behind the camera to be something that we really put our focus on.” Emily in Paris remains a hit for Netflix, and is currently in the top 10 most-viewed shows on the platform around the world.",Arts/Television & radio,Ukraine’s culture minister blasts Emily in Paris over ‘unacceptable’ stereotype,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/03/ukraine-culture-minister-blasts-emily-in-paris-over-insulting-stereotype
1/3/2022,"Some of us binged on box sets, others grappled with the challenges of home school and zoned out of Zoom meetings: for many, life under lockdown felt glum. But for Jeremy Lockwood, a retired GP turned palaeontologist, 2021 was a standout year featuring two big dinosaur discoveries and laying plans to make the Isle of Wight famous for its prehistoric inhabitants once more. “It was an absolutely thrilling time for me,” Lockwood said. Lockwood, 64, who retired as a family doctor in the Midlands seven years ago, was behind the widely publicised discovery of a new species of iguanadontian dinosaur with a distinctively large nose and a second species, nicknamed “the horned crocodile-faced Hell Heron”.  At the start of the pandemic, Lockwood re-registered with the General Medical Council and volunteered to work. However, his daughter, also a doctor, pointed out that before vaccines were available, hospitals would not want people in their 60s walking around wards. So for the past two years, Lockwood has immersed himself in fossil hunting on the beach and sifting through boxes of bones from museum archives. In palaeontology, like astronomy, amateurs often work alongside academics and their scientific contributions are frequently recognised. On retirement, Lockwood decided to put his lifelong interest in dinosaurs on a formal footing and persuaded his wife to move to the Isle of Wight, where a steady stream of dinosaur fossils emerge from the cliffs as they are eroded. He contacted Prof David Martill, of the University of Portsmouth, about doing a PhD and was quickly accepted. “I felt I had to do something to keep me active,” he said. “I don’t think I could’ve just played golf or grown roses.” Lockwood is revisiting a golden era for dinosaur discovery with a focus on iguanodons, the first specimen of which was unearthed by Gideon Mantell, also a doctor turned palaeontologist, in Sussex in 1825. Some have assumed that the long timeline of discovery means that the understanding of British dinosaurs is essentially “done and dusted”. On the contrary, Lockwood said, certain dogmas have remained unchallenged. And modern methods, such as using software to cluster specimens into a most likely family tree, have not always been applied to earlier finds. Most dinosaurs found on the Isle of Wight had been traditionally assigned to just one of two species: the plant-eating Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis. After sifting through many hundreds of bones that had been sitting in boxes in the Natural History Museum and the Dinosaur Isle museum, Lockwood identified a clear outlier with an enormous bulbous nose. The finding suggests there were far more iguanadontian dinosaurs in the Early Cretaceous of the UK than previously thought and raises the prospect of tracing the evolution of different traits through time. “You can almost liken this huge collection of iguanadontian bones to several jigsaw puzzles that are all mixed up,” said Lockwood. “I’m trying to put together something that is meaningful.” Officially, Lockwood is doing his doctorate part-time, but acknowledges that he has become “a bit obsessed”. “Sometimes I’ll work for 16 hours a day for a few weeks,” he said. “You struggle to find time to cut the lawn and decorate your house, and friends and family have to put up with you talking about dinosaurs all the time.” Alongside his work on archive specimens, Lockwood also makes daily surveys of the beach to spot any dinosaur bones emerging from the cliffs. Winter is peak collecting season. “Certainly with winter storms eroding things, that’s when the big finds come in,” said Lockwood. He is also coordinating a bid to redevelop the Dinosaur Isle museum, by a charitable group that Lockwood chairs together with a German company, Dinosaurier-Park International, after the local council launched a tender process. “I’m trying to take over the museum,” Lockwood said. “The Isle of Wight undersells its dinosaurs. Most people are unaware that we’re Europe’s hotspot for dinosaurs and early mammals. We need a much bigger museum.” Lockwood said he has “great sympathy” for former medical colleagues still working on the frontline during the pandemic and is particularly annoyed by the “lazy GP stereotype” sometimes aired in media coverage. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said. “You can see burnout happening all over the place.” Several doctors have got in touch to congratulate him on his recent successes. “Some of the nice tweets were from other doctors approaching retirement,” he said. “It’s really good to see that there’s a life after medicine.”",News/Science,The Isle of Wight’s dinosaur hunter: we’re going to need a bigger museum,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/03/isle-of-wight-dinosaur-hunter-need-bigger-museum-jeremy-lockwood
1/3/2022,"Good morning. The fallout from the Capitol attack continues as the first anniversary on Thursday approaches. Yesterday, a Republican member of the House committee investigating the events of 6 January 2021 had a stark warning for her party – they must choose between Trump and truth.  “Our party has to choose,” Liz Cheney told CBS’s Face the Nation. “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the constitution, but we cannot be both.” Trump supporters attacked Congress in an attempt to stop certification of his defeat by Joe Biden, which Trump maintains without evidence was the result of electoral fraud. Five people died after a riot in which a mob roamed the Capitol, searching for lawmakers to capture. On Sunday, Cheney and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee chair, again discussed the possibility of a criminal referral for Trump over his failure to attempt to stop the riot or for his obstruction of the investigation. What else did Cheney say? She told ABC’s This Week there were “potential criminal statutes at issue here, but I think that there’s absolutely no question that it was a dereliction of duty”. What did Thompson say? The Democrat told NBC’s Meet the Press the committee was examining whether it could issue subpoenas to members of Congress. The US could be under a rightwing dictatorship by 2030, a Canadian political science professor has warned, urging his country to protect itself against the “collapse of American democracy”. “We mustn’t dismiss these possibilities just because they seem ludicrous or too horrible to imagine,” Thomas Homer-Dixon, the founding director of the Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University in British Columbia, wrote in the Globe and Mail. “In 2014, the suggestion that Donald Trump would become president would also have struck nearly everyone as absurd. But today we live in a world where the absurd regularly becomes real and the horrible commonplace.” Homer-Dixon’s message was blunt: “By 2025, American democracy could collapse, causing extreme domestic political instability, including widespread civil violence. By 2030, if not sooner, the country could be governed by a rightwing dictatorship.” How does he think it will happen? The author cited eventualities centered on a Trump return to the White House in 2024, possibly including Republican-held state legislatures refusing to accept a Democratic win. Meanwhile, key Donald Trump loyalists Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn are at the forefront of a drive to expand Trumpist influence at the local level of US politics. The US government’s top medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has joined a growing body of experts who say hospitalisation figures form a better guide to the severity of the Omicron coronavirus variant than the case count of new infections. Referring to the Omicron surge in the US as a “tsunami”, Fauci also cautioned the public against putting too much stock in preliminary data suggesting the variant lacks the severity of earlier Covid-19 variants, such as Delta. “You have a virus that looks like it might be less severe, at least from data we’ve gathered from South Africa, the UK and even some from preliminary data from here in the US,” he told CNN’s State of the Union. Why is it important to look at hospitalization figures? A number of experts have questioned if such reports on rocketing cases of Covid cause unnecessary worry, and suggest deaths and hospitalization data should better inform mitigation efforts. What else did Fauci say? He said: “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about is, are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalisation?” A New York court is to unseal a confidential 2009 deal between Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Roberts Giuffre in what is a crunch week in Prince Andrew’s fight to avoid a public trial over claims he sexually assaulted Giuffre when she was 17 and had been trafficked. The world’s oldest person has celebrated her 119th birthday in Japan, saying she is determined to extend the record by another year. Kane Tanaka, who has a weakness for fizzy drinks and chocolate, marked the milestone yesterday with staff at the nursing home where she lives in Fukuoka prefecture, south-west Japan, according to media reports. A US spymaster inadvertently helped the Nazis develop one of the most effective disinformation campaigns of the second world war by spreading rumours about Hitler’s plans for a Where Eagles Dare-style Alpine redoubt, a historian with access to classified US military records has found. The personal Twitter account of the Georgia Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been permanently suspended for violating policies on Covid misinformation. The action against Greene on Sunday came under the “strike” system Twitter launched last March. A team of Afghan intelligence agents poured about 3,000 litres of liquor into a canal in Kabul, the country’s spy agency has said, as the Taliban authorities crack down on the sale of alcohol. Video footage released by the General Directorate of Intelligence showed its agents pouring alcohol stored in barrels into the canal after seizing it during a raid in the capital. Three people have also been arrested in the capital as the Taliban government increases raids over alcohol and drugs. Live, augmented reality filters on photo- and video-based social media platforms including TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat have evolved from silly hats and puppy dog ears to more subtle beautifying effects that may not be immediately obvious to other users. As well as adding makeup, many of the popular filters that have crept into app libraries also change the face’s proportions, generally to fit female, European beauty standards, with thinner faces, smaller noses and plump lips. But how are these unattainable ideals harming young users? Whether it’s taking fruit to work (and to the bedroom), being polite to rude strangers, planting spring bulbs even if you only have a pot and no garden, or taking up skinny-dipping, here’s a century of ways to make life better, with very little effort involved. Top tip: there are even more good suggestions in the comments under the article. Although Indigenous peoples make up only about 5% of the world’s population, their territories encompass 80% of global biodiversity, according to the 2020 report The Indigenous World. Today, it’s clear conservationists have been looking to traditional ecological knowledge in their work. At the same time, environmental organizations and tribes have been coming together to protect the natural world, and a key part of this teamwork has been land transfers. Wildlife officials in Yellowstone national park captured the “unusual” sight of a cheeky grizzly bear tagging along with a pack of hunting wolves, then making off with their kill. The enthralling video, posted to the National Parks Service Facebook page, shows the October incident in which the wolves from the Junction Butte pack in northern Yellowstone were joined by a lumbering grizzly as they hunted a herd of elk. After the wolves take down an elk, the bear moves in and steals the carcass: a phenomenon known as kleptoparasitism. First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

1/3/2022,"The sole distributor of Covid lateral flow tests (LFTs) to pharmacies closed for four days over the Christmas period just as it received a delivery of 2.5m devices, it has emerged. Alliance Healthcare took delivery of the tests on Christmas Eve and then shut, the Times reported. It provides LFTs to pharmacies to give out to the public.  An update from the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which represents NHS pharmacy contractors, confirmed 2.5m tests had been delivered to Alliance Healthcare on 24 December and added: “That stock was ready to be delivered [on] 29 December when Alliance Healthcare reopened after its planned Christmas break, and it represents circa 357,000 individual packs of seven tests and just over 6,000 cartons.” Each pharmacy is able to place a daily order for a single carton, containing about 55 packs, each with seven tests, but the surge in Omicron variant cases, guidance to increase the amount of testing and a change to the isolation rules has led to an increase in demand. People are able to leave Covid isolation early after testing negative, and school pupils are being encouraged to test at least twice weekly when they return to classrooms this week. This has led many pharmacies to run out within hours of delivery, and there were reports of patchy supplies before Christmas. Alliance Healthcare said last week there could be “some service disruption across the Alliance Healthcare network” due to Covid-related absence. The company has been approached by the Guardian but a UK spokesperson told the Times it had closed on 25 December until 28 December, and distribution had resumed on 29 December “when the majority of community pharmacies reopened”. He said: “Since the start of the pharmacy collect scheme, Alliance Healthcare UK has distributed over 280m lateral flow tests to community pharmacies across the UK. We distributed more than 2m lateral flow tests on Christmas Eve to support a number of community pharmacies that remained open over Christmas bank holiday and where stock was available. “We continue to distribute around 2m lateral flow tests daily from stock made available to us from UKHSA.” The UK Health Security Agency has been approached for comment.",News/World news,UK Covid test distributor shut for Christmas after receiving 2.5m kits,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/uk-covid-test-distributor-shut-christmas-25m-kits
