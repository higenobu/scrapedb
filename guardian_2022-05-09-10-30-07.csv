5/9/2022,"Huon Aquaculture accounted for the deaths of at least three-quarters of seals killed at Tasmanian salmon farms since the start of last year, with new data showing the company released more than 8,000 underwater explosives aimed at scaring the seals. Government data released in response to a right-to-information request revealed Huon Aquaculture, now owned by the controversial Brazilian meat company JBS, used 8,057 underwater explosives against seals in the 15 months to the end of March. The company accounted for 18 of the 23 seal deaths over the period. Under Tasmanian laws, companies are allowed to use underwater explosives, known as “seal crackers”, which can scare seals with loud noise and a flash of light. Other authorised measures include shooting seals with fabric-coated plastic shells containing lead shot, known as bean bag rounds, and darts with blunt tips known as “scare caps”. The data released by the Department Natural Resources and Environment showed the salmon industry has used more than 125,000 explosive devices since 2016. Between the first and second halves of the 15 months, Tassal and Petuna slashed their use of explosive devices by more than 75%. Huon Aquaculture went in the opposite direction, increasing its use by more than 10%. Huon Aquaculture did not respond directly when asked why its use of seal crackers remained high while the other two companies had reduced their use. The company pointed to a January 2021 backgrounder that said “our use of crackers has increased as a result of our expansion into offshore waters in Storm Bay; additional fish in the water equals more seals. If bait fish (mackerel) schools increase, as they often do in Storm Bay and the [D’Entrecasteaux] Channel, increasing incidents of opportunistic seals attempting to breach pen perimeters occur.” JBS completed its $425m purchase of Huon Aquaculture in mid-November 2021, fending off a rival takeover bid lodged by Tattarang, a private company owned by mining magnate Andrew Forrest. As part of its takeover campaign, JBS vowed Huon Aquaculture would “uphold the highest standards of fish health and sustainable farming practices”. Bec Howarth, a fish farm and marine campaigner with the Bob Brown Foundation, said Huon Aquaculture’s “continued high level of use of deafening seal crackers” indicated “JBS has already broken their commitment to cause no environmental harm”. The company did not respond directly to a question on why seal deaths on its leases accounted for such a large share of the total seal death toll. The department said seal deaths at salmon farms could be caused by a range of factors, including entanglement in netting, being struck by vessels, using deterrents and being euthanised. In one document released to Environment Tasmania in early 2021, government wildlife biologist Sam Thalmann wrote that salmon company estimates of seal deaths due to the use of approved deterrents were “likely a large underestimate as many seals with injury/penetrating wounds resulting from deterrents would leave the area and die outside the lease area”. The latest data also revealed that neither Petuna, the smallest of the three salmon producers, nor Huon Aquaculture, used bean bag rounds against seals. Petuna reported no seal deaths on its leases. Tassal is the only salmon producer still using bean bag rounds, but its reliance on them declined dramatically over the past year.

5/9/2022,"There are places in Brisbane where you can still see the tide mark; parts of the city where business remain closed and where temporary fences still surround kids’ playgrounds. “Given that people here are visibly, physically witnessing and experiencing what are most likely the effects of man-made climate change, it would bring it to the forefront of people’s minds when they go to vote,” says John Pittendreigh, a bike shop owner from Rosalie in Brisbane’s northern suburbs. Two months ago, floodwater about 1.2m high came through the shop, which sits at the western end of the electorate of Brisbane. The seat takes in the CBD and the inner-northern suburbs, including several areas which were badly affected by the March “rain bomb” downpour. Pittendreigh says he won’t vote for either of the major parties over their inaction, or lack of ambition, to deal with climate change. “I get a bit tired of hearing the powers that be say that we can’t afford to go to net zero. Because can we afford to cope with floods like this, fires like we’ve had every few years?” he says. “It’s kind of like, what all those people have been saying for the last 20, 30, 40 years, it’s manifesting right now. And of course it’s going to make a difference to how people vote.” Brisbane has changed hands a few times in recent decades, but since 2010 has been held by the Liberal National party. Incumbent Trevor Evans, the former National Retail Association boss and a relatively moderate Liberal, was first elected in 2016. The seat feels harder to pigeon-hole than inner-city electorates in other major capitals. Brisbane brings together apartment-dwellers in the CBD and Fortitude Valley; trendy and leafy areas like New Farm and Paddington; and a few affluent Liberal-leaning suburbs like Clayfield, Ascot and Hendra. Evans holds the seat by 4.9%, but it has become a key target for both Labor, which has preselected local businesswoman Madonna Jarrett, and the Greens’ candidate, the sales assistant and social science graduate Stephen Bates. Harrison Munday and Alisa Enomoto moved to Brisbane from the Gold Coast last year. They say the cost of living was a key concern that could win their vote. “Every time we’ve moved into a new apartment we end up in a smaller place, but paying way more,” Enomoto says. “I’d like to see more chances for younger people to buy houses, we’re renting and we’re looking to buy but it’s hard.” Munday, who works in construction, says petrol prices were a worry. “It’s getting harder and harder to move closer in to the city and still have an alright lifestyle.” Mini Compton lives in a sharehouse in the inner-north suburb of Red Hill. She says she was leaning towards the Greens, but was considering Labor because she liked the party’s shared home-ownership scheme. “I love the area, but the way property prices have gone up I couldn’t afford to buy here,” she says. Since the onset of the pandemic, people are moving to Queensland in droves – interstate migration is at its highest level in decades – and in some cases, bringing their politics with them. Markus Hofer and Kamon Miancharoen recently sold their home and business in Byron Bay and moved to New Farm. “I certainly wouldn’t vote for either Morrison or Albanese,” Hofer says. “Neither one of them are useful. “I will always vote for the Greens, not that we agree with all of their policies, which you never do, of course. But I think most of the major parties fail to recognise the pressing issues, like climate change, which will affect our children.” Ray O’Brien had an artery in his neck removed a few weeks ago; doctors have him a 40% chance of pulling through, he says. But a few weeks before election day the Fortitude Valley resident was back at the New Farm neighbourhood centre, where he comes for a toasted sandwich and a chat. He’d voted for Evans last time around, but this time he wasn’t sure. “I’d have to have a big think about it, you don’t want to jump,” he says. “I think Morrison, he’s always going to do something but never gets around to it.” Cindy Riches says she’s met Evans before and likes him, but won’t vote for the LNP because of environmental concerns. “I like him personally, but maybe not his politics,” she says. “I’ve pretty much always known who I was going to vote for, but I think it could change. I’ve changed my mind quite a few times already. “I think Morrison did some good things. We’ve never had a pandemic before and there was a while where everyone was having a go at him and I didn’t like that, because he was going the best he can. But then it felt like he really dropped the ball.” Daniel Lightfoot, a former business owner, says he’s happy with the government and will vote for the LNP. “I think the momentum that we’ve got up, we’ve got a world war on, everything we’ve got on, it’s too much, we can’t afford too much change. “You can’t be happy all the time, nobody’s perfect, but I think Morrison is having a fair crack. “I quite like the way he operates. They say he tells lies, but who doesn’t tell white fibs?”",News/Australia news,"With signs of floodwater still visible, the LNP’s hold on Brisbane may be in doubt",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/with-signs-of-floodwater-still-visible-the-lnps-hold-on-brisbane-may-be-in-doubt
5/9/2022,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed that 60 people who were sheltering in a school in Bilohorivka, near the eastern city of Luhansk, were killed when Russian forces bombed it this weekend. The UN has condemned the attack, with secretary general António Guterres saying he was “appalled” by it. More than 170 civilians were successfully evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol and have arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Officials said that more than 600 people have been evacuated from the plant and from Mariupol in total. Members of Ukraine’s Azov battalion trapped inside the Azovstal steel plant meanwhile said they fear they will be killed if captured by Russian forces, as they pleaded with Ukrainian authorities to help arrange their extraction. Speaking to the media from inside the besieged steelworks, Lt Illya Samoilenko vowed to fight on, saying that surrender would be a “gift” to the enemy. US president Joe Biden and other G7 leaders held a video call with Zelenskiy in a show of unity ahead of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on Monday. The G7 said it was committed to phasing out or banning Russian oil and denounced president Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people,” the group said in a statement, referring to Soviet Russia’s role in defeating Nazi Germany 77 years ago. New US visa bans on more than 2,600 Russian and Belarusian military officials include personnel believed to have operated in Bucha, the town outside Kyiv that has become synonymous with war crimes, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said. America’s top diplomat to Ukraine, Kristina Kvien, arrived with her team in Kyiv on Sunday in a step towards resuming the country’s presence in the capital. The visit was timed to commemorate Victory in Europe Day. Russian airstrikes on Sunday wounded one woman and knocked out electricity to six settlements in the Odesa region, authorities said. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau promised new weapons and other equipment for Ukraine after a surprise visit to the country during which he toured Irpin, a Kyiv suburb and scene of some of the worst early attacks by Russia. He also said Canada would remove trade tariffs on all Ukrainian imports for next year. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Berlin had “made a mistake” after it banned all flags, including Ukrainian flags, as part of its decision to suppress all displays of public support for the Russian invasion on Victory Day. “Taking a Ukrainian flag away from peaceful protesters is an attack on everyone who now defends Europe and Germany from Russian aggression with this flag in hands,” he said. The US president’s wife, Jill Biden, met with Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, on another unannounced visit on Sunday to mark Mother’s Day, while U2’s Bono and the Edge performed in a Kyiv bomb shelter. In an address to mark Ukraine’s 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Zelenskiy said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler but accused Russia of repeating his crimes. “This year we say ‘Never again’ differently. We hear ‘Never again’ differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.” Ukraine will prevail over Russia as freedom prevailed over the Nazi dictatorship in 1945, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said in a TV address to mark the 77th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Scholz, whose relations with Zelenskiy have been frosty, has not yet said whether he will accept an invitation to travel to Kyiv on Monday. The US has unveiled a new layer of sanctions on Russia, targeting services, Russia’s propaganda machine and its defence industry. They are primarily intended to close loopholes in the existing sanctions and to tighten the noose around the Russian economy by another few notches. The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow. Putin’s regime is “mirroring” the actions of the Nazis, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, will say on Monday as the Russian leader stages a military parade to celebrate Russia’s second world war victory, according to an advance copy of the speech. Wallace will say Putin and his inner circle should share the same fate as the Nazis, who ended up defeated and facing the Nuremberg trials for their atrocities. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is set to travel to Berlin for talks with Scholz on Monday and to make a major address.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 75 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-75-of-the-invasion
