3/11/2022,"Two weeks ago, middle-class Russians could work at and buy from the biggest global firms, plan holidays in the West, get their news from vibrant (if embattled) independent outlets, and post as they pleased on social media. State of play: With a new law promising prison time for journalists who so much as call Vladimir Putin's war a ""war,"" foreign and domestic outlets are ceasing operations. Western firms are leaving. Social media platforms are disappearing. Borders are tightening. Protesters are being jailed en masse. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets.

""The rules were clear and they are not anymore,"" Baunov says. ""We can’t say what is dangerous and what is not. You don’t know what sort of repression you can meet for the things that were tolerated before."" Educated Russians knew they were living in an autocracy, he says. Many had made peace with that. But they never expected to once again live in the type of country where “portraits of the Great Leader"" hang on the walls. People who work in journalism, the arts or for global firms are watching their career prospects evaporate. Russians have fled the country by the tens of thousands. Educated Russians have long discussed the conditions under which they might emigrate, he says. For many, border closures, social media shutdowns and “the deglobalization of Russia” were their red lines, he says. Others simply feel that they can't live as normal in a country that is attacking its neighbor. Yes, but: That is, of course, a subset of the population. One independent poll cited in the Washington Post puts approval for the war at 58%, with 23% disapproving. Many Russians never shopped at IKEA, drank Starbucks coffee or watched Netflix, and thus won’t feel the shift as keenly. When the financial sanctions start to bite, many will be prepared to accept the Kremlin line that they are victims of economic warfare from the West that has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine, Baunov says. Sanctions have already pervaded daily life and conversations in a way they never did in 2014, but he's not expecting them to push more Russians into the street. “The fear of repression is much higher than the discontent the sanctions make."" But Russians aren't entirely cut off from the West, or from the truth about the war. Telegram, the widely used social media app, is still operational. Online, Russians are flocking to virtual private networks. But Putin could still be fairly confident that when Russian forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol — just 35 miles from Russia — only a sliver of the population would ever see the gruesome images, or believe their country was responsible. The bottom line: The past two weeks were in some ways a step back in time. Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Disney are leaving. A new Iron Curtain is taking shape. Like this article?

3/11/2022,"The daughter of Sergei Lavrov’s mistress should be among the family members of Vladimir Putin’s cronies targeted with sanctions, MPs and campaigners said on Thursday. Ministers were urged to personally target the loved ones of those at the top of the Kremlin as they prepared for a fresh round of sanctions as early as next week. The Russian foreign minister’s alleged “second family”, including Svetlana Polyakova, his mistress, and Polina Kovaleva, her 26-year-old daughter, were identified as among those officials should look at. Around 140 Russian oligarchs and “enablers” of Vladimir Putin have now been named in the House of Commons, but asset freezes have only been placed on 23 Russian oligarchs, as well as the Russian president and Lavrov, since the invasion commenced. As billionaire Roman Abramovich was added to the sanction list on Thursday, government sources claimed their strategy was part of a ratcheting up of action against Putin. A foreign office source told The Telegraph: “Liz [Truss] and the Government's strategy is to debilitate the Russian economy – taking it out at the knees. It was also designed to send “a signal that no one and nothing is off the table in terms of sanctions, now and in the future”, the Whitehall insider said. But MPs questioned why the Government’s list was still dwarfed by the hundreds of individuals and entities sanctioned by the EU and the US. Ministers have claimed that their actions have been hampered by the evidence threshold required under current laws, but emergency legislation is due to pass next week. Layla Moran MP, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for foreign affairs and international development, said: “The Government is still way behind the EU and the US. The legislation hasn’t passed yet, so if they can act against Abramovich now why not the others?” Ms Moran called for action against 35 named “key enablers” of Putin in the House of Commons last month, including Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska, who was also added to the UK sanction list on Thursday. But many others on that list have been sanctioned in the EU or US but not in the UK. This includes Victor Zolotov, who leads Russia's National Guard and whose family is one richest in Russia in the real estate sector; Anton Vaino, Putin's chief of staff; and Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister. Ms Moran told the Telegraph that officials should also look at “the family and friends” of Putin's cronies as “one of the ways that they get around sanctions is to transfer funds and assets to family members"". ""They should be included in the list and ideally it should be automatic,"" she said. Maria Pevchikh, the head of the investigations at Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, named members of Lavrov’s family including Ms Polyakova and Ms Kovaleva as those who should have their assets frozen. Her calls were backed by MP Chris Bryant. Ms Polyakova, an actress and restaurateur, is said to have been in a relationship with Lavrov since the early 2000s and documents unearthed by the foundation show she has been abroad with the foreign minister more than 60 times, including on diplomatic missions. Her family’s lifestyle and growing multi-million-pound property portfolio is alleged to have been bankrolled by her lover. Miss Kovaleva’s now-deleted Instagram account shows her relaxing on a yacht owned by Deripaska. A profile of the 26-year-old on the Imperial College website reveals that she had studied for a master’s in Economics & Strategy for Business in 2018 after working for Gazprom, the Russian oil giant. In 2016, Miss Kovaleva, then aged 21, paid cash for a £4.4 million apartment on Kensington High Street. Ms Pevchikh asked: “Can anyone explain how this is possible? “Polina has to pack her Louis Vuitton suitcases, say goodbye to her British life and leave the UK. Should she not be able to explain where she got the £4.4 million from, her property must be arrested under the Unexplained Wealth Order procedure.” Miss Kovaleva could not be reached for comment on Thursday. Liz Truss is planning to unveil the next tranche of sanctions as early as next week, with at least half a dozen names expected to be added to the list, once the Economic Crime Bill becomes law. The Government does not comment in advance on the target of sanctions, partly for legal reasons, and partly to avoid tipping off oligarchs and allowing them time to move their assets out of the country. However, Britain has made clear its intention to sanction the 351 members of the Duma who voted to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent, thereby undermining Ukrainian sovereignty.",World/The Telegraph,"Daughter of Sergei Lavrov’s mistress should be next in line for Russian sanctions, say MPs",https://news.yahoo.com/daughter-sergei-lavrovs-mistress-next-190450189.html
3/11/2022,"Russian soldiers are torturing Ukrainian staff at a nuclear power plant which was attacked earlier this week, a senior Ukrainian politician has claimed. Ukrainian energy minister Herman Galushchenko said workers at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had been held hostage for four days. He claimed they were being forced to record an address to be used as propaganda. Russian forces triggered worldwide alarm last Friday after seizing the plant following a fierce gun battle. The UN's nuclear monitoring agency has said that none of the six reactors on the site have been directly damaged and radiation levels remain normal. Three Ukrainian soldiers were killed trying to defend the site, authorities said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of resorting to “nuclear terror” and wanting to “repeat” the Chernobyl disaster over the incident, in which a fire broke out in a training building and had to be put out.

A statement from the Russian news agency, TASS, claimed the plant was now being run ""jointly"" by Russian military personnel, Ukrainian specialists and the national guard. He said: ""Russian occupation forces torture the operating staff of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. According to our information, occupiers compelled the Plant's management to record an address that they plan to use for propaganda purposes. ""Russia's propaganda machine aims to create one more fake for its citizens and international community in an attempt to justify its crimes. ""Operating staff of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant have been held hostage for 4 days. There are about 500 Russian soldiers and 50 units of heavy equipment inside the station. ""The employees of the station are physically and psychologically exhausted."" Galushchenko called on the international community to ""take all measures"" to remove Russian troops from the site. ""A breakdown at a nuclear power plant due to the use of weapons by Russian troops will lead to a disaster for the whole of Europe. The responsibility for this will be entirely on Russia,"" he said. ""If a breakdown happens, Europeans will be forced to switch the comfort of their homes to radiation shelters. ""We must stop Russia's nuclear terrorism together. We must do it now – until it's too late."" Following the attack, the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine reported no changes in radiation levels but warned that could change. Read more: Ukraine army band play 'Don't Worry be Happy"" at barricades US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted that there were no signs of elevated radiation levels. She added: ""The plant's reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down."" Russian forces have also seized Chernobyl, as they attempt to take control of the country. On Wednesday Ukraine’s state power operator warned the plant had been disconnected from the grid, sparking fears over the cooling of spent fuel. The BBC reported that over 100 workers on the site have not been allowed to leave for more than 12 days after it was seized. Those working on the site have been allowed to go about their duties, the broadcaster was told, but while the situation remains calm there is reportedly limited access to food and medicine. The UN nuclear watchdog said on Tuesday systems monitoring nuclear material at the site have stopped transmitting data.

3/11/2022,"Ukraine has alleged that members of Russia's mercenary Wagner Group are fighting there. Officials on Tuesday shared photos of a dog tag it said belonged to a killed member of the group. Recent reports said Wagner Group agents were ordered to hunt and kill Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine's defense ministry posted photos of a dog tag it said belonged to one of the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary group who were said to be charged with assassinating President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Wagnerists are already dying on the territory of Ukraine,"" the defense ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post accompanying the photos. The defense ministry did not say how many people had been killed or how many dog tags it had collected. The photo of the dog tag showed, on one side, a website, a phone number with a Syrian country code, and an email address. The other side said ""Please help and contact us"" in English, French, and Arabic. The defense ministry said the dog tag was made for use in the Syrian war, which the US believes the Wagner Group was involved in. Multiple reports from 2017 and 2018 said the group was contracted by a Syrian state-owned oil company to capture and secure oil and gas fields from ISIS. Insider was unable to access the website inscribed on the dog tag, and received an automated message saying the phone number was unavailable. Upon contacting the email address for a request for comment, Insider received an auto-reply that said: ""This email address has been hijacked by Anonymous. You can respond, I am reading all emails. Glory to Ukraine!"" After asking who the email address belonged to, the person operating the account told Insider that they took over the email account after seeing the dog tag photos, and that it was not clear if it previously belonged to the Wagner Group. In its Facebook post, the Ukrainian defense ministry said the Wagner Group was helping Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, and that some of its agents were ""already participating in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine in the army of the aggressor."" It is not entirely clear who runs or finances the Wagner Group, but Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been most frequently linked to the organization. In 2020, the US Treasury said Prigozhin was ""believed to be the financier"" of the group. The European Parliament also described Prigozhin as having financial links to the group. Multiple reports published in the run-up to and during Russia's invasion, including by the Daily Beast and The Times of London, said Wagner Group mercenaries were being dispatched to Ukraine. The Times of London reported late last month that Russia ordered Wagner Group mercenaries in Kyiv to wipe out Zelenskyy's government, and offered them financial bonuses if they succeeded. The Times reported last week that Ukraine had foiled at least three assassination attempts by the Wagner Group and Chechen special forces on Zelenskyy in the prior week, without giving specifics. Zelenskyy previously warned that he was the ""number one target"" for Russia.

3/11/2022,"Facebook is changing a rule that prohibits users from calling for violence in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The change, which was first reported by Reuters, allows people in Ukraine and a handful of other countries “to call for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers in the context of the Ukraine invasion.” People in Ukraine, Poland and Russia are also permitted to “call for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.” Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement that the company was ""temporarily” allowing some posts that in the past would have been taken down under the company’s rules prohibiting inciting violence. He added that the company won’t allow “credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.” The company will also take down specific credible threats against Putin and Lukashenko, according to a memo reported by Reuters. “As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders,’” Stone said. “We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.” The change underscores just how much social media platforms are rushing to adapt their content policies amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Facebook has already taken several steps to limit the influence of Russian state media outlets and took down a network of fake accounts boosting pro-Russia propaganda. The Russian government has responded by banning Facebook.",World/Engadget,Facebook will ‘temporarily’ allow Ukrainians to call for the death of Putin and Russian soldiers,https://news.yahoo.com/facebook-temporarily-allows-for-violent-speech-putin-russian-soldiers-233445572.html
3/11/2022,"The post Donald Trump Pressuring Supporters to Fund New Plane After Emergency Landing appeared first on Consequence. Leave it to Donald Trump to brazenly ask supporters to fund a new big boy toy rather than fixing his old plane. Days after a jet flying him to Florida was forced to make an emergency landing (following a fundraising speech, naturally), the former president’s Save America PAC sent an email blast to supporters boasting about his plans for “a BRAND NEW Trump Force One.” “Do you remember Trump Force One?” the email read (via Rolling Stone). “Before becoming the greatest President of all time, I traveled the Country in my plane, known as Trump Force One. I have a very important update on my plane but I need to trust that you won’t share it with anyone: my team is building a BRAND NEW Trump Force One.” According to The Hill, the email also included a GIF of a plane taking off with a poll giving supporters the option to get a preview of the new Trump Force One. Linked to the poll is a donation page, which according to Rolling Stone, includes a box pre-checked for a recurring month-to-month contribution. Trump’s emergency landing took place on Saturday evening but wasn’t reported until Wednesday. He was flying in a jet lent to him by a GOP donor to return to Mar-a-Lago after a speech in New Orleans in which he proposed a bonkers plan for the US to “bomb the shit out of Russia” with fighter jets painted with the Chinese flag. As for the plane Trump used throughout his 2016 presidential campaign, CNN reported last year that the gold-plated jet was sitting idle in disrepair at a New York airport 60 miles north of Manhattan. According to flight records, Trump hadn’t flown the 757 since he lost access to Air Force One on Inauguration Day. Apparently, Trump’s ambitions for another presidential run require a brand new plane funded by his supporters, rather than simply fixing the original. In other recent Trump news, his social media platform Truth Social was essentially DOA when it was set to launch in late February.

3/11/2022,"By Francesco Guarascio and Gabriela Baczynska PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union announced fresh sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus on Wednesday but EU leaders are set to rebuff Kyiv's appeal for accelerated membership of the bloc when they meet on Thursday to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine. The 27-nation EU blacklisted 14 more oligarchs and froze ties with Belarus' central bank and top lenders there, the executive European Commission said on the 14th day of a war that has sent two million Ukrainians fleeing abroad. Speaking ahead of the leaders' summit on Thursday and Friday at Versailles, near Paris, an EU official left no doubt that Kyiv's appeal to be admitted swiftly to the bloc was a no-go. ""Membership could take a long time,"" said the official, who is involved in preparing the Versailles talks, adding the leaders still wanted to strengthen ties with Ukraine. They will discuss boosting Kyiv's links to the EU single market and to Europe's energy grid under ideas for enhanced partnership or ""association plus plus"", the official said. That is bound to disappoint Ukraine, which is seeking more Western financial, military and other help as it battles Russia. ""The leaders are unlikely to offer Ukraine candidate status. It is more likely that there will be more cooperation within the association agreement,"" said a second EU official. ""Offering more is impossible because this is a country that is now engulfed by war, partially under Russian occupation, and maybe at some point even completely under occupation."" Ukraine signed its association agreement with the EU after mass street protests in 2014 overthrew a Russia-allied president who had sought to revive closer ties with Moscow. In response, Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine and backed armed separatists in the east of the country, triggering Western sanctions on Russia's energy, banking and defence sectors. MORE SANCTIONS The sanctions announced on Wednesday targeted 160 individuals, including parliamentarians and 14 more oligarchs, among them the head of Russia's national carrier Aeroflot. Altogether, EU restrictions apply to 862 people and 53 entities linked to the invasion of Ukraine. The EU also banned exports of maritime technology to Russia and sought to prevent crypto assets being used to circumvent the sanctions. The new measures prohibit transactions with the Central Bank of Belarus and exclude three Belarusian banks from the SWIFT banking system: Belagroprombank, Bank Dabrabyt, and the Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus. The bloc has already slapped such measures on seven Russian lenders. EU leaders will also discuss on Thursday ways of weaning their countries off a heavy reliance on Russian energy imports. But they are split over how hard to press Russia and also over EU enlargement, with France and the Netherlands prominent sceptics about taking in more members, a process that requires unanimity. The accession process usually takes years and requires meeting far-ranging economic, political and other criteria. Western European governments have become more wary of enlargement because ex-communist states such as Poland and Hungary, which joined in 2004, have turned increasingly eurosceptic while benefiting from EU financial aid.
