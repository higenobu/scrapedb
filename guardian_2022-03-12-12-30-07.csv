3/12/2022,"Lavish onsite perks may be a thing of the past for employees at Meta, who will now have to do their own laundry due to company cutbacks. The parent company of Facebook informed its employees it would be cutting down on various perks including free laundry, dry cleaning and valet service, as well as delaying the daily free dinner by half an hour from 6pm to 6.30pm, the New York Times first reported. The pushed-back dinner service means fewer employees will get to eat on campus, as the company’s last shuttle bus departs the office at 6pm. As a result, employees will now have to decide between a free meal or a free ride home. It also will make it more difficult for employees to stock up on free food to bring home as leftovers. In an email to the Protocol news site confirming the changes, a company spokesperson, Tracy Clayton, said: “Our culinary services are first and foremost an onsite perk for people while they’re working in the office … We want food to be served to meet that need while people might be working late.” The announcement comes as many Meta employees are scheduled to return to the office on 28 March, though the company has offered remote work alternatives to others. Staff members were frustrated upon hearing the news, according to seven employees who spoke on condition of anonymity to the New York Times. Many complained in the comments section of the post announcing the changes, said a few employees who saw the post. Some asked if Meta planned on compensating employees in other ways and whether the company had undertaken an employee survey to see how the new changes would affect the workforce. In response to the changes, Meta said that it would be increasing its employees’ wellness stipend from $700 to $3,000 this year. The current stipend covers costs related to physical or mental health, financial planning, and care for children, older people and pets. Meta’s chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, defended the changes and criticized the sense of entitlement in the comments, according to the employees. One employee from Meta’s food service team criticized those who said the comments would harm Meta’s workplace culture, according to two other employees. “I can honestly say when our peers are cramming three to 10 to-go boxes full of steak to take them home, nobody cares about our culture,” the employee wrote. “A decision was made to try and curb some of the abuse while eliminating six million to-go boxes.” The employee’s comment quickly racked up support from co-workers and became the most-liked comment in the thread by midday Friday. A Meta spokesperson told the New York Times that the changes reflected the various needs of the company’s hybrid workforce. “As we return to the office, we’ve adjusted on-site services and amenities to better reflect the needs of our hybrid workforce… We believe people and teams will be increasingly distributed in the future, and we’re committed to building an experience that helps everyone be successful,” the spokesperson said. In February, Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, unveiled changes at the company as it pivots to the metaverse, a still mostly hypothetical virtual world accessed by virtual and augmented reality technology. In addition to various new slogans and internal branding changes such as renaming its News Feed to simply “Feed”, Zuckerberg said he would be calling employees “metamates”. Despite Zuckerberg’s confidence in the shift, the company took a historic plunge last month following its most recent earnings report and its revelation that it had experienced its first ever drop in daily user numbers. Meta shares fell by 26.4% in one day in February, one of the biggest one-day losses in history for a US company. The slump resulted in Zuckerberg’s personal wealth falling by nearly $30bn. The company also reported a rare decline in profit due to a sharp increase in expenses as it invests in various metaverse projects.",News/Technology,Meta employees left to do their own laundry as perks get cut,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/11/meta-employees-perks-cut-free-laundry
3/12/2022,"Nine more refugees who have been detained for several years have been released from Melbourne’s Park hotel, however those freed remain uncertain about whether they will be allowed to permanently live in Australia. On Friday night, the refugees were unexpectedly informed of their release. They were not given any reason for the change in their situation, according to the Refugee Action Collective, which criticised the Australian Border Force for releasing the men “after close of business Friday to minimise media scrutiny”. There are understood to be 18 refugees who remain in the Park hotel – where the world No 1 tennis player Novak Djokovic was detained before being deported from Australia in January. In addition to the nine men released from the Park hotel – where refugees have been detained for years after being medically evacuated from offshore detention facilities – three men were released from the Brisbane detention centre and one from the Broadmeadows detention centre in Melbourne. Mohammed “Joy” Miah, a 41-year-old refugee from Bangladesh who had been in the Park hotel for more than two years and was first detained on Christmas Island after seeking asylum in 2013, received the news he was being released during evening prayers on Friday. “It was big news for me. After so many years I finally have my freedom, I am a free man right now,” he told the Guardian. “I am happy, but I am also nervous about what my status will be. I didn’t sleep last night. I am also worried for those who still remain in the hotel,” he said. Miah said he wanted to thank his lawyers, as well as authorities involved in his release, and said he hoped to be able to meet his supporters and celebrate with friends. “It will also be great to be able to go for a swim,” he said. He said he was now in a motel in the city and that the ABF told him they would tell him his new status on Thursday. He said he had been given some food, including noodles and potatoes, but no money. Others released had been put up in a suburban motel in Melbourne’s west, according to the Refugee Action Collective, which said they had been given $150 while waiting to hear their final status. Earlier this month, longtime detainee and vocal advocate for those inside the Park hotel, Iranian Mehdi Ali, was released after nine years in detention to be flown to be resettled in the US. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chris Breen, a spokesman for the Refugee Action Collective, welcomed the release of the 13 men but said they had been “wrongly held for almost nine years” and “should never have been detained”. “It is increasingly cruel, arbitrary and absurd to continue to detain the remaining medevac refugees. They must be immediately freed,” he said. Breen said there were around 50 people in similar detention circumstances nationally. He said eight of those released had been given bridging visas, one had been given community detention, and the others were unclear.

The Australian government’s policies had not changed and illegal maritime arrivals would not be settled in Australia. While not confirming the visa status of those released, the spokesperson noted that final departure bridging visas allowed holders to reside lawfully in Australia while they make arrangements to depart the country. The visa does not provide a pathway to settlement in Australia. Breen said that while the bridging visas by definition did not allow holders to live in Australia permanently, because a resettlement agreement with the US had been exhausted and the lack of other resettlement deals, holders would likely be allowed to stay longer than the duration of the visa. He said some refugees in Australia from Nauru on six-month bridging visas “are still in Australia five years later”. “The government doesn’t want to admit that people are effectively resettling here, but that’s what we think is happening … because what’s the third country they can go to?” Breen said. Hossain Latifi is one of the 18 that remain in the Park hotel. “We have committed no crime, our detention is inhuman, there is no justice,” the 32-year-old Iranian said.",News/Australia news,Nine refugees released from Melbourne’s Park hotel face uncertain future,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/nine-refugees-released-from-melbournes-park-hotel-face-uncertain-future
