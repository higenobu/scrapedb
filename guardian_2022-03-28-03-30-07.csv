3/28/2022,"Artists and celebrities in Brazil have voiced shock and outrage after an electoral judge ordered one of the country’s biggest music festivals to outlaw “political demonstrations” by performers after a legal challenge from President Jair Bolsonaro’s political party. Lawyers representing Bolsonaro’s Liberal party made their petition to the supreme electoral court on Saturday after Brazil’s far-right leader was pilloried at this weekend’s Lollapalooza event by pop stars and rappers, including the British singer Marina. “Fuck Bolsonaro. Fuck him. We are sick of this energy,” Marina told fans on Friday, at the start of the three-day gathering in São Paulo. With political tensions increasing ahead of Brazil’s October presidential election, Brazilian artists also voiced their fury at Bolsonaro’s far-right administration, which has overseen a historic attack on the environment and catastrophically mishandled a Covid pandemic that has killed more than 650,000 citizens. The pop sensation Pabllo Vittar chanted “Get out Bolsonaro!” and danced into the crowd clutching a red towel featuring the image of former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who polls suggest will beat Bolsonaro in October. The rapper Emicida urged teenagers to register to vote, before shouting the earthy rallying cry of the opposition movement: “Ei Bolsonaro, vai tomar no cu”, which politely translates as “Bolsonaro get stuffed”. Liberal party lawyers claimed the actions of Vittar and Marina constituted “premature campaigning” and demanded such “blatant” pro-Lula propaganda and anti-Bolsonaro slurs be stopped. In his ruling, the electoral justice, Raul Araújo, agreed such behaviour constituted “political-electoral propaganda”. Any further “ostentatious and extemporaneous” electioneering from musicians performing at Lollapalooza was forbidden, with a 50,000 reais fine (about £8,000) for any violations. Araújo’s decision sparked an angry backlash, with public figures denouncing what many called an act of censorship. “This is authoritarianism. This is fear … we will not and we must not remain silent,” said the progressive church leader Henrique Vieira, who performed with Emicida at Lollapalooza. “As well as setting an extraordinarily dangerous precedent, this is utterly illegal. Dark times,” tweeted the lawyer Augusto de Arruda Botelho. “No one silences the voice of the people,” vowed the singer-songwriter Zélia Duncan. The pop superstar Anitta mocked the ruling. “50 thousand? Darn … one less bag,” she shrugged, before tweeting sarcastically: “GET OUT BOLSONAROOOOO. Does this law also apply outside Brazil? Cos I only play international festivals.” One of Brazil’s most famous television presenters, Luciano Huck, said the decision harked back to Brazil’s two-decade military dictatorship, when a hardline decree known as the Institutional Act No 5 outlawed freedom of expression and assembly, and authorised closing congress. “At a music festival, it’s the audience who decide whether they boo or applaud the opinion of an artist who is on stage, not the supreme electoral court,” Huck tweeted. The outcry came on a weekend when Brazil’s anxiously awaited election race – which some fear could see acts of political violence – finally came to life. Leading members of Brazil’s left gathered at a music festival in Niterói, a city near Rio, on Saturday to celebrate the 100th birthday of the Communist Party of Brazil and hail Lula as the politician capable of ending what one speaker called “the Bolsonaro nightmare”. Addressing thousands of flag-waving supporters on the spectacular shores ofGuanabara Bay, Lula declared: “Brace yourself, Brazil, because we are going to fix this country.” “You can be certain that it will be hard, but we will win and we will do everything we possibly can to fix this country and make the people smile once again,” said Lula, 76, slamming Bolsonaro’s “psychopathic behaviour”. On Sunday, Bolsonaro also seemed in campaign mode as he appeared before hundreds of supporters in the capital, Brasília, to declare himself ready to fight for a second term. “Our enemy isn’t external, it’s internal. This fight isn’t left versus right. It’s a fight of good versus evil – and we will win this fight,” vowed the former army captain who won the election in 2018 after Lula was controversially banned from running and jailed. Bolsonaro, 67, was hailed as “the captain of the people” as he took to the stage with a ballpoint pen tucked into his shirt pocket in an apparent attempt to burnish his populist credentials. Several followers wore caps reading: “Bolsonaro 2022”. The host, Cuiabano Lima, likened leftists to the devil and compared Bolsonaro to Jesus. “This man is the chosen one … and we must push onwards with this because Brazil deserves it and Brazil believes,” he said. Many opposition politicians wondered why the declarations of leftist artists were considered electioneering, while such pro-Bolsonaro pronouncements were not. Earlier this year, the judge behind Sunday’s decision reportedly overruled similar petitions against pro-Bolsonaro billboards on the grounds that it could not be proved the president knew of their existence.",News/World news,Stars in Brazil voice fury as judge orders festival to ban ‘political demonstrations’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/stars-in-brazil-voice-fury-as-judge-orders-festival-to-ban-political-demonstrations
3/28/2022,"A charity that is helping Ukrainian refugees trying to come to the UK has said no visas have been granted to those it is supporting, nearly a fortnight after a government scheme was launched. The head of Positive Action in Housing, Robina Qureshi, said the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme had given people “false hope” and amounted to a “gimmick”. She said it had led to refugees turning to social media in desperation to seek sponsors, and those seeking help could be exploited by human traffickers. The government scheme opened on 14 March and aimed to allow individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to bring Ukrainians, including those without family ties to the UK, to safety after the Russian invasion. Announcing it in the Commons, Michael Gove, the housing and communities secretary, said there was no limit on the numbers coming in, and ministers have speculated that they expect eventual numbers to reach hundreds of thousands. Qureshi said: “The government made a fanfare of its Homes for Ukraine community sponsorship programme. Michael Gove told parliament on 14 March that there was no limit on the numbers coming in. Yet none of the families we are supporting have yet got a visa to travel under the community sponsorship scheme and are still waiting.” Those in Ukraine have already criticised the scheme, saying the claims made by ministers do not match the reality in the country. Qureshi said Positive Action in Housing had been helping 483 families, young people and unaccompanied minors in the last week alone who needed a sponsor who would house them. She said the forms involved in the scheme were “tortuous and confusing – with no guideline”. The charity runs Room for Refugees, the UK’s longest-running refugee hosting programme, which began in 2002. Speaking to PA Media, she gave examples of people putting themselves at risk, where they had arranged places to stay and sponsors through social media. One included a Ukrainian mother who said she was sending her two teenage sons, one of whom is autistic, alone to make the journey across Europe. “Another woman told us that she would leave Kharkiv now if the UK government offered a visa, but she is waiting in her home terrified,” Qureshi said. “Refugees are turning to wholly unsafe methods of getting here, meeting people in Facebook groups, on social media. And this government is responsible for giving people false hope and putting them further in the way of danger.” She said human traffickers “thrive on refugee conflicts and displacements anytime there are vulnerable populations on the move”, and visa restrictions should be waived. “[It] has resulted in obvious and dangerous breaches of basic safeguarding on an industrial scale – all instigated by one government department.” On Saturday the policing minister, Kit Malthouse, said refugees had arrived in the UK through the Homes for Ukraine scheme, but that the number would not be published until next week. Separately, the government has a Ukraine Family Scheme for people seeking to join relatives or extend their stay in the UK.",News/UK news,‘False hope’: refugee charity attacks UK’s Homes for Ukraine scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/false-hope-refugee-charity-attacks-uks-homes-for-ukraine-scheme
3/28/2022,"When Vladimir Putin recognised Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics, days before his invasion of Ukraine, one of the most powerful denunciations came from Kenya’s envoy to the UN. Martin Kimani cited his country’s own history as he warned against irredentism and expansionism: “We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression,” he said. On two general assembly resolutions – the first denouncing the invasion, the second blaming Russia for creating a humanitarian crisis – 140 or more nations have approved. Only four have voted with Russia to oppose them: a rogues’ gallery of Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea. Yet widespread condemnation, along with the west’s unexpected unity, should not be mistaken for Russian isolation. Having boasted of a relationship with “no limits”, and sharing a common interest in countering the global might of the US and Nato, China is now seeking to portray itself in a more nuanced light and avoid economic and political damage – but is not, in reality, distancing itself from Russia. Beijing is not alone. Few of the world’s most populous nations, and only a few leading players outside the west, have assailed Mr Putin. Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, was in Moscow as the tanks rolled into Ukraine. India, which has a longstanding strategic relationship with Russia and high anxiety about its ties to both Pakistan and China, has discussed a “rouble-rupee” swap to help Moscow beat western sanctions. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro – courted by Mr Putin – even sees the war as a “good opportunity” to encroach on indigenous land in search of materials for fertiliser. Russia’s influence in and dealings with the Middle East have expanded substantially since its decisive role in the Syrian war, leaving many countries hedging their bets, in the midst of a broader realignment of the region. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, recently refused to take Joe Biden’s call – a week after speaking to Vladimir Putin. The UAE said no to a call too. It voted against Russia at the UN general assembly, where votes are non-binding and largely symbolic, but abstained in a similar vote at the security council, which would have had more weight. South Africa initially called for the withdrawal of Russian troops, but then blamed Nato expansion for the war. Sixteen other African nations joined it in abstaining in the first general assembly vote thanks to growing economic ties, as well as a long-established position of non-alignment and the Soviet Union’s support for liberation movements. The war has triggered, not caused, a dramatic new phase in the long-term reshaping of our world. Trumpism has done more than China’s growing might to accelerate perceptions of US decline. Selective compassion and double standards have increased suspicion and rancour. Another illegal war – Iraq – looms largest. But many also note the contrast between the welcome outpouring of concern for Ukrainian refugees in Europe and widespread indifference or hostility to those fleeing other wars. Russia’s use of cluster munitions is rightly condemned, but Mr Biden has yet to reverse his predecessor’s decision to axe a ban on their use. Kenya’s righteous criticism of Russia’s aggression came with a pointed addendum: a condemnation of “the trend in the last few decades of powerful states, including members of this security council, breaching international law with little regard”. Mr Putin’s current position reflects not only his willingness to aid unsavoury regimes, and his malign interference around the world, but also the sins and failures of the US and the west. To address these is not a hopelessly idealistic endeavour, but one of necessary realism, if we are to forge the powerful alliances needed against cruel acts of aggression.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin and the world: it’s not just about China | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/27/the-guardian-view-on-putin-and-the-world-its-not-just-about-china
3/28/2022,"We went out to clap for our NHS heroes and praised the fortitude of care home workers. We smiled at those who served us through the pandemic at supermarket tills. Most were relieved when their children returned to school. We even waved as our wheelie bins were emptied. Some of these key workers who kept our society and economy running through Covid-19 had the highest potential exposure to the disease. Your report (Long Covid could create a generation affected by disability, expert warns, 23 March) was a stark reminder that so far not only have 163,000-plus lost their lives in the UK to Covid, but 1.5 million (2.4% of the UK population) have self-reported symptoms of long Covid. Of these workers who had Covid-19, many are now suffering a longer-term disabling issue, becoming unfit to work from the debilitating illness, or requiring reasonable adjustments and support. Occupational health and safety professionals believe these workers deserve a better and more sustainable future, and so we call on our colleagues in healthcare, occupational health and human resources, as well as employers and government, to work together to provide the tailor-made, flexible support that each one of them will need to not only return to work but thrive when they get there.Ruth WilkinsonHead of health and safety, Institution of Occupational Safety and Health  The goverment’s laissez-faire approach to Covid – don’t worry about masks, and, if you insist on testing, you can pay for the kits yourselves – was intended to get Britain back to work and help the business community on to its feet. It’s having precisely the opposite effect: staff absenteeism because of the debilitating illness is now widespread, and it’s all but paralysing certain industries, especially hospitality and theatre. Smaller businesses are finding it especially hard to absorb and many have closed. Since my play Bloody Difficult Women opened at the Riverside Studios in west London, four out of the six members of the cast have tested positive and had to temporarily stand down from the production to be replaced by other actors. All are now mercifully back for its last week, and we have been lucky with the quality of the actors who have come to our aid and understanding audiences. But of course it racks up costs. We only had to abandon three performances, whereas other productions, often in the West End with significantly bigger outgoings, have had to go dark for longer and financially ruinous periods. The implication of current government Covid policy is that even if you know you have the virus, it’s perfectly legal to infect others. This spreads around an illness that is still extremely unpleasant and potentially fatal to individuals with underlying conditions, defies common sense, and shows no regard whatsoever for business. It would have saved so much trouble if we’d just been told to keep wearing masks in crowded spaces.Tim WalkerLondon  My daughter is high-risk, and until now I have tested negative with lateral flow tests before seeing her. Now free tests are being withdrawn. Do I take a chance with her health, or do I stop seeing her? No good telling me the symptoms are so mild now – that’s no help to somebody with reduced immunity.Doris BridgemanLane End, Buckinghamshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
