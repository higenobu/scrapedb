3/29/2022,"Russia’s military may have announced a change of plan at the end of last week to focus on the “liberation of Donbas”, but the apparent decision reflected the reality that Moscow’s initial multi-front invasion plan has failed in the face of dogged resistance from Ukraine. The advance on Kyiv became bogged down after less than a week, particularly to the north-west of the city. If Ukraine’s declaration that it has taken the heavily contested town of Irpin’ on Monday is correct, the advance may now even be going into reverse. But the capital, for all its political significance, has not been the focus for a week or more. Russia has already refocused its efforts to concentrate on the east, recognising that its forces were too spread out, that morale is tumbling and that it is sustaining heavier than expected losses. Western officials estimate that Russia has lost at least 20 battalion tactical groups – the smallest operating unit of its forces, with an average size of 800 at full strength - out of an original invasion force of 115 to 120. They are “no longer combat effective,” one said on Friday.\ Already day after day, Russian forces, with Chechen fighters at the forefront, have been grinding forward into the ravaged southern port city of Mariupol, where perhaps 160,000 residents are enduring the worst of wartime conditions. “Mariupol will fall,” said Mathieu Boulegue of the Chatham House thinktank. “And this will probably happen in a few days.” His comments reflect the grim reality of Russia’s encirclement of the city, where its defenders are gradually running out of food and ammunition. For Kyiv is it is a alarming prospect, which is partly why the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. had pleaded at Thursday’s Nato summit for gifts of tanks to “try to relieve Mariupol and to help the thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city”. A Russian victory in Mariupol would in turn free up about 6,000 troops to turn to what could be the defining objective of the war – encircling Ukraine’s best military forces to the north. These are the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) units, 10 brigades at the start of the war, which have been facing the occupied Donbas region since 2015. That includes occupying a network of first world war-style trenches along the “line of contact” at Ukraine’s eastern edge. To some extent, the effort has already begun, with Russian forces trying to bypass the already besieged city of Kharkiv to the north, and break through by capturing Izium. Boulegue, however, believes that Russia’s forces are sufficiently exhausted from the first phase of fighting that they will need “a phase-two pause” before trying “phase three, the pincer”. Russia is trying to generate reinforcements both from remaining military reserves, forces brought in from Syria, Armenia and elsewhere, plus fresh conscripts whose operational usefulness is limited. These may amount to 10 battalions, western intelligence estimates, or half of those lost. There is also evidence that other Russian forces, the “most battered units deployed to Ukraine, are now being withdrawn from the battlefield and sent to Russia to recuperate”, according to Konrad Muzyka, an open-source intelligence analyst. One example was revealed by satellite imagery, he said, which showed there were “no Russian troops at Hostomel airport” – a heavily contested military base north-west of Kyiv still under Russian control. Russia will slow tempo in the east for only as long as it is forced to. The key question is whether it can succeed in enveloping Ukraine’s land forces in due course. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), questions whether Moscow’s forces can do so given their halting performance so far, and the defensive success Ukraine has had with anti-tank and other weapons it has received from the west. “Even by revising their military objectives to be more modest, it isn’t clear whether they can successfully encircle Ukrainian forces of the JFO. In fact, I consider it unlikely,” Reynolds said. His Rusi colleague Jack Watling said in a recent paper that to survive in the east, Ukrainian forces needed to “prevent the Russians from being able to concentrate their efforts on one axis at a time” by continuing to counter-attack in and around Kyiv. In other words, Russia’s new strategy is to try to concentrate its forces to achieve a breakthrough. Ukraine, meanwhile, has to find a way of making the invaders’ original multiple-front offensive continue to work against itself, by keeping the fighting spread out.",News/World news,"As Russia tries to focus its offensive, Ukraine seeks to scattergun ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/as-russia-tries-to-focus-its-offensive-ukraine-seeks-to-scattergun
3/29/2022,"Iceland will temporarily return to using palm oil in some own label foods from June because the price of a key alternative – sunflower oil – has soared by 1,000% during the Ukraine war. In 2018 the supermarket chain announced to much fanfare that it was removing the controversial ingredient which has been linked to forest destruction. As part of its stand against the product it launched a TV advert made with Greenpeace which was pulled after it was deemed to be too political. But now the retailer’s boss, Richard Walker, has announced in a blog that he is making a U-turn with “huge regret”. “The only alternative to using palm oil under the current circumstances would simply be to clear our freezers and shelves of a wide range of staples including frozen chips and other potato products,” he said. The Black Sea region, led by Ukraine and Russia, together account for 80% of supplies of sunflower oil according to analysts at the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and supplies have been interrupted by the war. Walker said the company would use sustainable palm oil as “a last resort and as a strictly temporary measure” in a limited range of products with all packs clearly showing the ingredient if used. In some products palm oil can be substituted for rapeseed oil. “I haven’t changed my mind about palm oil – which is why this is strictly a temporary move, and one that I would not countenance at all if I could see any viable alternative,” Walker said. “This is a serious emergency and one that requires tough choices and compromises if we are to achieve our prime objective of continuing to feed the nation and of delivering affordable food to those on tight budgets, who will inevitably be those worst affected by the unprecedented pressures now building up in our supply chains.” Iceland’s move, first reported by the Grocer, comes as farmers and retailers have called for urgent government action to prevent soaring food prices and potential shortages in the UK as the war in Ukraine threatens grain and oilseed harvests, energy costs and the production of fertiliser. Russia and Ukraine are major wheat producers and also account for about 45% of rapeseed which is imported to the UK and used to make cooking oil and more than a fifth of maize imports, which are used for animal feed and biofuels. The boss of British poultry supplier 2 Sisters recently said food price inflation in the UK could reach 15% by the summer as the overall cost of producing chicken had risen by 50% in a year. He said energy costs had risen 400% and packaging by a fifth while the cost of carbon dioxide, which is used in the slaughter of pigs and poultry as well as in packaging, was up 350%.",News/Business,Iceland reverts to palm oil ‘with regret’ as Ukraine war hits food prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/28/iceland-reverts-to-palm-oil-with-regret-as-ukraine-war-hits-food-prices
3/29/2022,"Reaction to the government’s announcement in its education white paper that all schools in England must become academies is remarkably muted. Last time this was tried, in 2016, ministers were forced into a U-turn, due in part to opposition from Conservative councils. Six years later, and six months after becoming education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi has sweetened the bill to win them over. Local authorities will now be allowed to set up their own trusts, spinning off their education departments into third-sector bodies. They have also been promised powers to intervene if and when academies are not delivering what is needed by communities. A long-awaited report on provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities is also due. For years, multi-academy trusts (Mats) escaped inspection altogether, with Ofsted’s remit limited to individual schools. The Department for Education now finally admits that this hasn’t worked. Two reviews are on the way: one of academy regulation, and another of their senior leaders’ excessive pay. Currently, 44% of the nearly 22,000 schools in England are academies, including 78% of secondaries and 37% of primaries. The hope that the white paper holds out is that a greater degree of order can be created out of the current patchwork. There is a logic to the division of labour it envisions, whereby councils plan provision and coordinate admissions, and trusts concentrate on delivery. But when it comes to real-life situations, such as the case of an excluded child that a council wants to place in a particular school, it is far from clear that said council will be granted the power to override a trust’s objections. Similarly, the test of a commitment to enable individual schools to jump from one Mat to another will be in the small print. The emphasis in the white paper on the quality of teaching is welcome, as is targeted funding for disadvantaged areas and a mental health lead in each school. So too is the government’s commitment to the research-focused Education Endowment Foundation, and the creation of a compulsory register of children not attending school. But there is no getting away from the fact that the overriding aim of the white paper is to turn all schools into academies. No one who wants the best for the next generation could object to the government’s ambition to “spread the brilliance of the best trusts”. But the fact is that Mats have increased inequality in the system, with their schools overrepresented at the bottom as well as the top of league tables. The education secretary and his officials can see this evidence as well as anyone else. Hence their pledge to bring the laggards up to scratch. There is no good reason to think that they will succeed. Removing schools from the control of elected bodies is not a route to excellence. The experience of recent years shows that the fragmentation of the system has led to worse outcomes for some of the most vulnerable children, including through “off-rolling”, when pupils leave a school without a formal exclusion. Having refused to fund the pandemic package that his own expert appointee recommended, Boris Johnson wants Mr Zahawi to polish up the government’s poor record. If resistance to this latest push towards academies is muted, the worry is that this is because schools and councils are worn out by fighting a policy agenda driven more by ideology than evidence.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on multi-academy trusts: one direction | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/the-guardian-view-on-multi-academy-trusts-one-direction
3/29/2022,"Apolitical gaffe, Michael Kinsley wrote, “is when a politician tells the truth – some obvious truth he isn’t supposed to say”. President Joe Biden, a self-proclaimed “gaffe machine”, did not fail to deliver at the weekend by declaring that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, “cannot remain in power”. A Freudian slip, perhaps, from a US president who has already called Mr Putin a “butcher” and a “murderous dictator”. But regime change in Russia is not official US policy – and nor should it be, given the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons Mr Putin possesses. The uproar caused by Mr Biden’s comment led to it being walked back by the White House. This was the mature and correct way for Washington to proceed. Mr Biden had made the unfortunate comment on the eve of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Progress has been slow. But the US president’s statement threatened to bring negotiations to a halt. If Mr Biden’s words had not been withdrawn, Mr Putin’s worst fears – that the US wanted him gone – would be confirmed. The Russian president, who has hitherto shown no restraint, would have no reason to compromise, with everything to lose. The Roman statesman Cicero thought that the purpose of war was peace. The Ukrainian army has bravely fought Russian forces to a standstill, but cannot retake the ground it has lost. Mr Putin’s blitzkrieg to topple the Kyiv government failed. There’s no end in sight for the first major European conflict this century. Ukraine is fighting a just war of self-defence. Russia is engaged in an unjust war of aggression. Cicero believed that “an unjust peace is better than a just war”. But terms of peace that were too favourable to Russia would simply be an agreement for further fighting. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has adopted a twin-track strategy to deal with Moscow. He is softening his diplomatic position – telling Russian journalists that Ukraine could be neutral and compromise over the status of the eastern Donbas region as part of a peace deal – while hardening his military position by calling for more tanks, missiles and even fighter jets from Nato. Mr Zelenskiy wants to secure as much sovereignty and autonomy as possible. He deserves our support. Mr Putin does not appear to be taking the talks anywhere near as seriously as Ukraine is. This might explain Mr Zelenskiy’s call for a face-to-face meeting with Mr Putin. The Russian president does not want to be seen to lose. Mr Putin has become drunk on his success in extending his influence across the former Soviet republics and in the Middle East. Yet his immoral and illegal war in Ukraine has galvanised Nato and united the EU. Mr Putin has made real what he most feared: a Ukraine proudly distinct from Russia in which liberals and nationalists have found common cause. Kyiv and Moscow are likely to have to settle for less than they want. Ukraine is an imperfect democracy, but one able to negotiate legitimate political outcomes without violence and within the rule of law. This cannot be said of Russia under Mr Putin. Underlying Mr Biden’s gaffe was a truth that Russia’s president cannot be trusted to honour a peace deal. Nor can his criminal invasion be rewarded. However, only Russians can remove Mr Putin from the negotiations – and their country’s history is not without civil uprisings precipitated by unpopular wars.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Zelenskiy’s strategy: giving war – and peace – a chance | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/the-guardian-view-on-zelenskiys-strategy-giving-war-and-peace-a-chance
3/29/2022,"The remaining tickets for the final of the women’s European Championship sold out in an hour with 100 days to go before England kick-off against Austria at Old Trafford. As well as the Wembley final, England’s matches against Norway at the Brighton & Hove Community Stadium Stadium and Northern Ireland at St Mary’s and Belgium’s game with Iceland at the Manchester City Academy Stadium have all sold out. More than 350,000 of the 700,000 tickets available for the tournament had been sold during pre-sales and a public ballot window, which means that the tournament has already sailed past the record of 240,045 tickets sold for Euro 2017 in the Netherlands. “We want as many full stadia and as many spectators in the stadiums as possible,” the head of tournament delivery, Chris Bryant, said. “That is easily the aspiration for us. That’s what we think will make the most difference, that we bring in that atmosphere that’s worthy of the European Championships, that’s the objective.” Ticket prices range from £5 to £50 meaning a family of four can watch a match for as little as £30. “We know that the opening game is going to do well, we know the final’s going to do well, we know the England games will do well, I’m pretty sure the tickets for those that are going to sell out, if not today, then in the coming days,” Bryant said. “Then, it’s about redirecting everybody’s interest into the other games, and there are some fantastic games across the country. “This is European Championship football at the very highest level, tickets are incredibly affordable, it’s a fantastic day out for families. It really rivals any kind of family activity, we think, and we’ve done that purposely, so that we can try and get stadiums full.” As Uefa unveiled a set of giant table football players on Carnaby Street in London, the England defender Millie Bright said that although it is hard to turn attention away from the Women’s Super League title race she was feeling the buzz. “Coming down here today, it raises the levels of excitement,” Bright said. “It’s hard to have that vision when you’re still in season and things are so intense in the league. But it’s definitely in the back of your mind.” Winning the Euros on home soil will be a tough challenge. There are many teams with a realistic shot at the title. Bright, who has excelled for England and Chelsea, said there is a freshness to England that allows for real positivity about their chances. “Sometimes change is just needed,” she said of manager, Sarina Wiegman’s, arrival last summer. “We’ve been on a journey for a long time but it feels like there’s a real freshness to the group and to the way we’re playing. There’s a lot of hard work that’s gone in over the years, but I think we’ve started to find our identity now as a group. From the performances, hopefully the fans are just as excited as we are and that the games in recent months are just a starting point.” England have gone evolved greatly as a team but the expectations of the tournament have evolved too, said Bryant. “It’s not an easy time to be doing a major event on the back of the pandemic and everyone’s commitments and budgets have remained intact. “What I would say is the level of expectation of women’s football is massively growing, to the extent where we’re having to keep up with that and manage expectations and that is maybe not the easiest thing to do. We’re definitely doing that, though, the event that we will deliver this summer will be far bigger than the event that we planned and assumed we would be doing when we were announced as hosts. The World Cup in France in 2019 was a massive wake-up call that women’s football is a really moving and involving sport and, actually, hang on a minute, sponsor and supporter interest is growing.” There is huge pressure on the organisers to deliver an event that captures the mood of the nation in the same way the Olympics did in 2012, where people watched things they would never have considered before to be a part of it. With new eyes on the game, there is a desire to draw fans in beyond the Euros. Bright said the added pressure was not new though. “I don’t see it as pressure, it’s part of the journey,” she said. “As a female in football that is part of the journey. One bad performance and all of a sudden the game’s not worth anything or women aren’t worth anything in football, that’s what we’re trying to stamp out. So, for us, it’s no more pressure, it’s just part of the game that we have to deal with day in and day out. There’s going to be criticism, every single day in football, that’s just part and parcel, but we don’t want to be discriminated against as women in football, that’s the difference.”",Sport/Football,Women’s Euro 2022 set for record crowds as England aim for home glory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/womens-euro-2022-set-for-record-crowds-as-england-aim-for-home-glory
3/29/2022,"Rishi Sunak has defended his spring statement from accusations that it failed to do enough to help the poorest in Britain with soaring living costs by arguing that extra help could have put government finances at risk. In a fractious exchange with MPs on the House of Commons Treasury committee, the chancellor said he had been forced to make choices over where to prioritise support because of rising government borrowing costs as the British economy is buffeted by surging inflation made worse by Russia’s war in Ukraine. “One may say, if they don’t like my choices, they’d be happy to borrow a lot more. That’s just not something I think is responsible or sensible,” he said. The chancellor was attacked for being a “fiscal illusionist” for pledging some tax cuts while driving up the overall tax burden and not helping the poorest in society. The Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh asked: “Why did you prioritise your ambition to have a reputation as a tax-cutter over helping people really worried about heating their homes or feeding their kids?” Sunak said it was not possible to fully insulate every household in Britain from high levels of inflation and insisted that his spring statement and earlier £9bn energy support package were “progressive”, with measures to help the poorest in society. The chancellor has faced heavy criticism for not increasing the value of universal credit benefits by more than the planned 3.1% rate from April, despite forecasts for inflation to rise to 8% in the same month. However, he said there were sufficient alternative measures in place – including hardship funding available through local councils and support to help unemployed people into work. “I appreciate people may have wanted to do more on welfare, less to cut tax to people in work. Other people may have chosen to borrow lots more, [but] those are not the choices I’d be comfortable with,” he said. Faced with angry questions from Labour MPs on the committee, Sunak admitted he would not be a “tax-cutting chancellor” despite his plans to increase the threshold for national insurance contributions and a promise to cut income tax in future. Having been heavily criticised as out of touch after being pictured filling up a car with petrol that was not his own after his spring statement, the chancellor admitted that he drove a Volkswagen Golf, rather than the Kia Rio, which belonged to a Sainsbury’s employee and was borrowed for the photo shoot. McDonagh suggested to Sunak that he was assuming voters were stupid if he did not realise that they would see the 2024 tax cut as a transparent election ploy. However, the chancellor said he wanted to give people a sense of the “direction of travel” to cut taxes in future. Sunak argued that interest rates on UK government debt or inflation rising by more than expected would be costly for the public purse, as it would force the country to pay more on debt servicing costs. He said Britain was already forecast to borrow 60% more than the average since the second world war in the coming year. “[Higher borrowing] has the risk of stoking inflationary pressure, and I don’t think it’s the right long-term thing to do for the country. I think we need to be responsible with borrowing, I think we need to be getting debt down and borrowing under control. That provides for me a constraint as to what is possible, and then there’s a choice about where to target that support.” Despite his warnings over the heightened risks to the public finances, Sunak has faced heavy criticism for committing to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19% in two years’ time at a cost of £6bn to the exchequer – a development with consequences for the amount of wriggle room the chancellor has left in the government finances. Forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility show the chancellor has about £30bn of headroom left within self-imposed targets for the public finances after his spring statement measures. It said last week the government has as much as a 66% chance of meeting the target, based on historical evidence. Earlier, the head of the OBR, Richard Hughes, told MPs the chancellor’s reliance on rebates through the tax system limited the effect of support to the poorest in society. Hughes said: “The chancellor has used a combination of the council tax systems, supporting energy bills and the tax system to deliver support and relief for people facing this cost-of-living squeeze, rather than the benefits system. “One of the limitations of that is that you are limited by how many people you can reach through the tax system. “If people aren’t in work, or working the number of hours they need to get them beyond the personal allowances and thresholds, they are more difficult to reach through the tax system than they would be through something like universal credit, which reaches people lower down the income scale.”",News/UK news,Sunak says spring statement is ‘progressive’ in response to criticism from MPs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/28/sunak-says-spring-statement-is-progressive-amid-criticism-from-mps
3/29/2022,"The first fines for breaches of lockdown rules in Downing Street are expected to be issued imminently, government insiders have told the Guardian. Multiple sources said the Metropolitan police had made referrals for the first tranche of fixed penalty notices (FPNs) connected with parties and gatherings being investigated by police in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. It comes two months after police began examining material from the Whitehall inquiry carried out by the senior civil servant Sue Gray into multiple alleged breaches of Covid rules. The Met has sent questionnaires to more than 100 members of staff and aides, including Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie; the head of the civil service, Simon Case; and the prime minister’s former principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Last week, the force said it intended to start questioning witnesses, with no FPNs issued so far. The announcement suggested officers had not yet found breaches that meet the evidentiary threshold for fines to be issued without further interviews. In total, police are investigating 12 separate events in 2020 and 2021, six of which Johnson is said to have attended. Scotland Yard said it had obtained more than 300 photographs and 500 pages of documents showing what Gray’s inquiry believes to be potential rule-breaking. Images include photos taken at parties and those taken from security-system cameras showing when people entered and exited buildings. The investigation is being carried out by detectives from the force’s special enquiries team, which focuses on sensitive cases. It has been led by Jane Connors, the force’s deputy assistant commissioner and lead for Covid enforcement.

The nearly four-hour telecast drew 15.36 million viewers according to time-zone-adjusted fast national numbers from Nielsen, Variety reported Monday. The audience figures show a 56% improvement over the 2021 ceremony, which drew an all-time low of 10.4 million viewers and prompted the Academy and ABC to shake up the program in an attempt to woo more viewers. The Academy hired hosts for the first time since Jimmy Kimmel in 2018 (that ceremony drew 26.6 million viewers): the all-female trio of Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall. Producers also controversially cut eight technical categories from the telecast (though it featured clips of each during the ceremony) and introduced fan voting for top film and movie moment via Twitter. Despite the changes, the 2022 Oscars were the second least viewed of all time. Before last year, the ceremony had never dipped below 20 million viewers. The 2020 ceremony, which aired 9 February, a more typical date for the program, averaged 23.6 million viewers.

3/29/2022,"Boris Johnson’s flagship energy strategy has been held up over a row with Rishi Sunak about funding a new generation of up to eight nuclear power stations costing the public more than £13bn. The strategy, which has been delayed for a month, was due to be published this week but has now been pencilled for 5 April after disagreement about the multibillion-pound cost of new nuclear plants and amid ongoing tensions between the prime minister and his chancellor, as well as the wider cabinet. Johnson has told the nuclear industry that he wants 25% of electricity generation to come from nuclear power by 2050, up from 16% now. Whitehall sources told the Guardian this shift could require the building of about eight new nuclear power stations. Draft targets suggest ministers are looking at 30GW of nuclear power capacity, meaning a huge building programme would be needed as capacity is due to fall to 3.6GW as plants are decommissioned. Of the eight UK plants currently in operation, all but one are due to be switched off by 2030. Each new plant would require the government to take a minority stake in the project to reduce the risk to developers, and substantial cash outlay to encourage investment. Despite Johnson’s keenness for new nuclear power, Sunak is concerned about the cost to the taxpayer, or extra costs added to soaring energy bills. The Treasury has already promised £1.7bn of direct cash for a single large-scale nuclear project – the £20bn Sizewell C – as well as £120m for a new Future Nuclear Enabling Fund, which aims to address barriers to entering the sector. Building eight generation plants could cost more than £13bn in initial investment costs from the government if the same amount of investment were to be put in, according to a Whitehall source. However, the government is also pushing for the nuclear industry to reduce its build costs. Officials also expect No 10 will approve an energy bill to set targets and strategy for energy security, which would be unveiled in the Queen’s speech in May. A nuclear financing bill is already due to get royal assent next week, allowing new nuclear power station owners to get more stable returns and aimed at getting institutional investors to put money in, but the government is still expecting to have to take stakes in new projects. It also allows the cost of new nuclear power stations to be loaded on to household bills – a move that is politically unpalatable given the rising cost of gas and electricity bills. Downing Street sources denied any “showdown” between Johnson and Sunak, who are due to sit down and “talk calmly” through energy strategy issues in the next few days. A Treasury source said negotiations were ongoing and were complex because they involved funding far beyond the current spending round. If an agreement cannot be reached by 14 April then the strategy could have to be delayed until after the May local elections because major announcements cannot be made during the “purdah” period beforehand. There is separately understood to be a disagreement over the Treasury resisting extra money for energy efficiency measures. No 10 is pushing for a big expansion of offshore wind and is “open-minded” about more onshore wind, which would need a loosening of current planning laws. There is less controversy with the Treasury on this issue as renewables do not need additional subsidies. However, many Conservative MPs with rural constituencies are opposed to more turbines in their seats. Under draft plans, there is a move to give communities living near onshore wind turbines a discount on their bills and more of a collective say over the projects, rather than permitting them to be blocked by just one individual under current rules. One government source said it was “all about cost” and that the Treasury also seemed keener on battery storage for renewables than the government taking big stakes in renewable projects. The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and a move against allowing Chinese investment to Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast.",News/Environment,Boris Johnson’s energy strategy held up over funding row with Rishi Sunak,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/boris-johnsons-energy-strategy-funding-row-with-rishi-sunak
3/29/2022,"At first glance, it may feel unfair to pick on Sainsbury’s in a campaign against low pay in the supermarket sector. The group’s rate of hourly basic pay is higher than Tesco’s (£10 versus £9.55) and, among Sainsbury’s directly employed staff, it is only those in outer London who are currently denied the real living wage. The company is not operating from the P&O Ferries manual of employee relations. Yet one can equally argue that campaign group Share Action, with backing from investment heavyweights Legal & General and National Employment Savings Trust among others, has chosen well in calling on Sainsbury’s to pursue full living wage accreditation. In the midst of a cost of living crisis, there is a strong sense that if cuddly Sainsbury’s, which will gush endlessly about its responsible approach to doing business, can’t step up in all respects, then nobody in the supermarket industry ever will. How much would it cost to make the leap? The company won’t say but one suspects an increase from £10.50 to £11.05 in outer London wouldn’t be the most stretching element. Rather, it might be the inclusion of third-party contractors, such as cleaners and security guards. Then there would need to be commitment to keep pace with the real living wage permanently – a pledge, the boardroom may feel, that is tricky if rivals won’t budge. Yet Sainsbury’s and its listed and unlisted peers would be well-advised to take the shareholder resolution seriously. Supermarket-land is a place of stable profit margins, so it is hard to understand how the main operators have been able to resist real living wage accreditation for so long. Half the companies in the FTSE 100 index are already there. As energy prices rise, and then rise again, this campaign could strike a popular chord. One of the big chains should show leadership and break ranks. In the long history of Barclays’ self-inflicted cock-ups, this one almost counts as mundane: a £450m hit to profits from what looks like a straightforward error in the admin department. The investment bank had authorisation in the US to issue $21bn-worth (£16bn) of structured notes – securities giving exposure to baskets of stocks, interest rates, commodities or whatever – and exceeded its limit by $15bn. The £450m liability, the bank’s current best estimate, arises from the need to buy back at par value those notes that are showing a loss. How could a bank with a small army of risk and compliance officers make such an expensive mistake? We’ll have to wait for an explanation until an independent body has reviewed matters including “the control environment”, but something clearly went spectacularly wrong in, or between, the risk and compliance departments. The affair is a long way short of being career-threatening for new chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan, but Barclays has just blown three months-worth of shareholder returns (at 2021’s pace) in one go. It is a reminder that the investment bank, for all the signs of greater stability and discipline in the last couple of years, remains hard for investors to love. With Barclays, there’s always something around the next corner. It’s a bit rich for P&O Ferries to claim all it ever wanted was “a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes”. If that were the case, the company’s wealthy owner, Dubai-based DP World, would have used its easy access to UK government ministers to highlight problems and seek consensual reform. Instead, DP and P&O Ferries opted for on-the-spot redundancies and brazen law-breaking. By doing so, they created such an uproar that the government will introduce speedy legislation to force minimum wages on UK ferry routes. In the sense, P&O Ferries will have got its desired level playing field, but it’s hard to regard this saga as anything other than a colossal example of management incompetence. The P&O Ferries brand has been trashed for years, and the company may end up having to pay compensation awards to non-consulted workers anyway since not all will wish to return to the shambolic ship. Meanwhile, Peter Hebblethwaite, the hapless chief executive, surely won’t be able to resist calls for him to walk the plank. At that point, attention will concentrate solely on DP World. It blessed the sackings, as was clear in last week’s testimony to MPs, and has expressed no regrets subsequently. Even if the government gets its way on the ferries, DP does not deserve a place on the UK’s freeport scheme; the relationship should be broken permanently.",News/Business,Sainsbury’s will do well to take the low-pay pressure seriously | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/28/sainsburys-will-do-well-to-take-the-low-pay-pressure-seriously
3/29/2022,"Prince William faces a struggle to reinvent the monarchy as a progressive force, royal experts have warned, after he made it clear there would be a change of strategy following his controversial trip to the Caribbean. The future king has said he intends to break with tradition in his reign and become a “unifying force”, with a slimmed-down royal household and a more “reactionary and agile” approach to communications that would depart from the “never complain, never explain” policy adopted by his predecessors, according to reports in the Daily Mail. But royal experts said it had been several decades since “never explain, never complain” was palace policy, and the prince would have to do more to keep the monarchy relevant for younger generations. William’s comments came after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s tour of the Caribbean, in which they encountered the strength of republican sentiment in Jamaica and the Bahamas, where the Queen remains head of state, and took part in photo opportunities that have been criticised as throwbacks to colonialism. One source quoted in the Mail said that William had privately expressed concern about how the Land Rover moment would be received several weeks before the tour. William issued a statement after the trip – understood to have not been discussed with the Queen and Charles first – in which he said the visit “had brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future”. One former palace public relations source said this was unsurprising as William was more flexible over his future role as king than many understood. “There’s a feeling in the institution that over time the monarchy can update itself and change, but it has to be gradual, subtle and carefully thought through,” he said. It was a particularly thorny issue at the moment, he said, as the role of the monarchy was to act as a “unifying presence” outside party politics, focusing on important social issues everyone could agree on, which is difficult in an “increasingly disunited society”. One of these issues was likely to include how to improve the diversity of palace staff, especially in senior positions, to ensure it better reflects the national make-up. Philip Murphy, a professor at the University of London and former director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, said William’s comments reflect how the palace is “involved in a constant learning process” that balances tradition with public opinion. “Sometimes it has to ditch the standard way of doing things and reinvent the process, and that’s what we’re seeing here.” Murphy thought the problems in the Caribbean had likely arisen because the region was a “constitutional grey zone”. William had to juggle the expectation that, as someone in line to be head of state, he would “acknowledge the very deep sense of grievance” with an understanding that it would be “constitutionally improper” to broach matters for the UK government such as “the sensitive issues of colonialism or slavery”.However he suggested that William could have been “more flexible and imaginative” in Jamaica. “I think the British government in particular have got to rethink the whole nature of royal tours,” he said. “They create a disconnect between some of the coverage in the rightwing tabloids in Britain and the way these issues are covered and commented on in the international media and in Commonwealth countries themselves.” William is understood to have also raised questions about whether it would be appropriate for him to be head of the Commonwealth, since the role is not hereditary. In 2018, Commonwealth leaders formally announced that Prince Charles would become the next head after the Queen. Mark Borkowski, a PR agent who is a long-standing observer of the royal family, suggested William might also overhaul the honours system to strip its connection with the legacy of empire. The focus on his vision raises questions over whether Prince Charles’ reign would be “some interim organisation until William takes over”, he said. “That’s where real change will happen, because we’ve got generations of young Britons who don’t have any empathy with the boomer vision of the world.” Borkowski believes William is thinking imaginatively about his future reign in a changing society much as his grandmother did when she became Queen as a young woman, and developed an image of “what post-empire Britain looked like”. ”We’ve had a long serving monarch with a throwback to the last days of empire. Her son and grandson are so far away from that.”",News/UK news,"Prince William faces struggle to reinvent monarchy, say royal experts",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/28/prince-william-faces-struggle-to-reinvent-monarchy-say-royal-experts
3/29/2022,"It’s disheartening and depressing that UN member states couldn’t reach the agreement needed for a treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas (UN ocean treaty summit collapses as states accused of dragging out talks, 21 March). The longer they can’t agree, the longer the greedy plunder of remote seas continues. And yet the waters and wildlife in the high seas are already protected by international law and have been for 30 years, specifically by articles 117 and 118 of the UN Law of the Sea. Why did the international community not do what it signed up to? If protective law had been put into effect as it should have been, we wouldn’t be facing such a daunting ecological crisis in the ocean today. Nor would we be needing another treaty.Deb Rowan WrightBristol  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
