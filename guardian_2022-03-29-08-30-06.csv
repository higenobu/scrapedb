3/29/2022,"Genetic testing to predict how individuals will respond to common medicines should be implemented without delay to reduce the risk of side-effects and ensure that everyone is given the right drug at the right dose, experts have said. About 6.5% of UK hospital admissions are caused by adverse drug reactions, while most prescription medicines only work on 30% to 50% of people. A significant part of this is due to genetics: almost 99% of people carry at least one genetic variation that affects their response to certain drugs, including commonly prescribed painkillers, heart disease drugs and antidepressants. By the age of 70, about 90% of people are taking at least one of these medications. A new report, published by the British Pharmacological Society and the Royal College of Physicians, argues that many of these issues could be addressed through pharmacogenomic testing, which allows personalised prescribing according to people’s genes. “The ultimate goal is to make pharmacogenomic prescribing a reality for everyone within the NHS, which will empower healthcare professionals to deliver better, more personalised care,” said Sir Munir Pirmohamed, a professor of pharmacology and therapeutics at the University of Liverpool, who chaired the report’s working party. “The aim of pharmacogenomics is to make sure patients get the right drug, at the right dose, at the right time to be able to improve their outcomes, treat their symptoms, cure their disease and prevent side-effects.” Some pharmacogenomic testing is already done within the NHS. For example, patients with breast or colon cancer may be tested to see whether they can safely be prescribed the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil. However, other common drugs, such as the painkiller codeine, are known to work better, or cause more side-effects in some patients than others, but doctors do not routinely test before prescribing them. About 8% of the UK population lack the gene that allows codeine to work properly, meaning they will not get any pain relief from it. Another example is the antibiotic gentamicin: about one person in every 500 is genetically predisposed to develop hearing loss if they take it. “The UK is a world leader in genomic medicine, and the implementation of a wider range of pharmacogenomic tests would further demonstrate UK leadership,” said Pirmohamed. “Today we are calling on government and the health service to ensure that patients across the UK are offered these tests where there is evidence to show their utility.” Prof Sir Mark Caulfield, president-elect of the British Pharmacological Society, who contributed to the report, said: “This report provides the blueprint and identifies the resources and actions needed to ensure pharmacogenomics becomes usual care in the NHS over the next three years.” He added that reactive testing to investigate why someone isn’t responding to their medication, or is experiencing side-effects, could be implemented as soon as next year, subject to NHS approval. Further ahead, patients could be offered a once-in-a-lifetime blood or saliva test to predict their responses to multiple drugs and guide their future treatment. Such testing would cost about £100–£150 per person, but could result in long-term savings to the NHS. Each year, adverse drug reactions cost the NHS an estimated £650m, but this figure could be as high as £2bn, Pirmohamed said. “Adverse drug reactions as a whole cost a lot to the NHS. Even if we can prevent 30% of those through implementing pharmacogenomics, we’ll be saving a lot of money.”",News/Science,Experts push for genetic testing to personalise drug prescriptions,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/29/experts-push-for-genetic-testing-to-personalise-drug-prescriptions
3/29/2022,"Britain should use its leading role in the Ukraine war urgently to repair its relations with the EU by offering to help strengthen European security both via Nato and rapidly evolving EU defence plans, the director of Chatham House, Dr Robin Niblett, has proposed. That will require working more formally with Brussels on foreign policy and defence, including issues such as cyber, intelligence and disinformation, said Niblett, who heads Britain’s leading foreign policy thinktank. He said the move would not only strengthen Europe following “Vladimir Putin’s decision to rip up the post-cold war security arrangements in Europe”, but help indirectly to repair EU-UK economic trade relations. But he warned: “The risk remains that allowing these areas of dispute and friction in the economic sphere to persist, and possibly fester, will undermine both sides’ desire to forge a closer relationship on foreign and security policy – as is now even more critical.” Niblett suggested that as the parallel processes to develop a new Nato “strategic concept” and the EU’s “strategic compass” are under way, options could be found to embed the UK, Niblett said, alongside the US and Canada, in more regular transatlantic coordination. “The risk otherwise is that the UK could find itself excluded from deeper defence industrial and technological cooperation within the EU. “A more specific UK–EU dialogue on security could also emerge from the Russia–Ukraine crisis. That could include the establishment of a sanctions review group that would ensure alignment on the timing and targets of sanctions, as well as conditions for their lifting.” His ideas, likely to be influential within Whitehall, come in a sweeping 70-page report looking at how the UK has implemented its year-old landmark integrated foreign and defence review. Niblett argues that the UK has made progress in setting out on its own as a global trading nation, adding the UK has been self-evidently out in front on training and arming the Ukrainians, but points to many weaknesses on aid, human rights, moral hypocrisy and economic performance. At the time of the strategic review’s publication, with its focus on a UK tilt to the Indo-Pacific, there was criticism of its relative silence about the UK’s future foreign and defence relations with the EU, a subject that was deliberately untouched in the final Brexit agreements at British insistence. Through the Ukraine conflict, Britain has on ad hoc basis worked either bilaterally or through Nato, G7 meetings or impromptu groupings. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has attended one EU foreign ministers meeting in early March, along with Ukraine and the US, but Boris Johnson, for instance, was not asked to attend the lengthy EU heads of government meeting last week attended by Joe Biden on further economic sanctions against Russia. Niblett described the antagonism Johnson has shown to the EU as counterproductive at a time of acute danger for Europe. “Continuing to fuel a fractious relationship with this major neighbouring institution carries clear risks for the UK’s economy,” he said. He also pointed out that over the past year the UK has retreated from global health and poverty challenges, due to aid cuts. Inconsistencies on human rights policies and climate change, including their relationship to the pursuit of new trade deals, have “opened the government up to damaging accusations of hypocrisy and being are out of step with the UK’s role as a champion of liberal democratic governance”, the report says. Niblett said: “As a newly minted solo power that is still reintroducing itself on the world stage, justifiable accusations of double standards and evidence of hypocrisy will be deeply damaging. There will be no more precious asset in the future for Britain’s influence in the world than a reputation for consistency.” The way in which major cuts to the UK’s overseas aid budget were implemented, for example, “revealed a callous side to Britain” which has been further amplified by its approach to refugee applications, not only from Ukraine but from around the world.",News/World news,"UK must seize chance to repair relations with EU, says thinktank head",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/uk-must-seize-chance-to-repair-relations-with-eu-says-thinktank-head
3/29/2022,"Books, stationery, phone chargers, toys and exam study guides are the latest items to be ferried to customers on fast-track delivery bikes via a partnership between WH Smith and Deliveroo. The high street retailer will offer 600 products for delivery in as little as 20 minutes, joining similar services offered by supermarkets, pharmacies and takeaways. Sean Toal, the managing director of WH Smith’s high street business, said: “We’re always exploring new ways to delight our customers both in store and online by providing them with an exceptional shopping experience.” Like many other retailers, the popularity of WH Smith’s website grew rapidly during the pandemic with sales more than tripling over spring and summer 2020. The site already offers next day delivery to homes or for collection in stores. Now 10 stores will benefit from the retailer’s deal with Deliveroo starting with Reading on Tuesday and followed next week by Cambridge, Brighton, Oxford, Leeds, St Albans and Guildford as well as Richmond, Chiswick and Muswell Hill in London. Carlo Mocci, the chief business officer for Deliveroo’s UK and Irish business, said the tie-up with WH Smith would increase choice for shoppers and “create more work for riders across the UK”. None of Deliveroo’s couriers are guaranteed holiday pay or sick pay as it says they are independent self-employed contractors. Deliveroo, which started out as a specialist in takeaway deliveries, has gradually expanded into new areas in recent years. During the pandemic it catered to demand for home delivery of groceries via tie-ups with Morrison, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Tesco’s One Stop convenience store chain, in addition to the Co-op, covering about 6,000 grocery stores across the UK and Ireland. It also delivers for Majestic Wine and Lloyds Pharmacy. Aldi also trialled home deliveries with the fim but ditched it in January as consumers returned to stores in greater numbers. The desire for fast-track delivery has spurred the growth of specialist players including Getir, Gorillas and GoPuff which have raised hundreds of millions of pounds to expand their network of bikes and mopeds to deliver groceries in less than 15 minutes. DIY chains are also getting in on the act with Screwfix launching a one-hour delivery service across about a third of the country covering more than 9,000 products.",News/Business,Deliveroo extends its range adding new partner WH Smith’s products,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/deliveroo-extends-its-range-adding-new-partner-wh-smith-products
3/29/2022,"Men in their early 60s have a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease on warmer than usual summer nights, according to new research. Previous studies have focused on the potential for warm spells of weather that involve extreme or sustained periods of high temperatures to coincide with surges in deaths and hospitalisations due to heart conditions. However, until now, findings related to age and gender have been inconsistent. Researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada set out to examine any possible link between high summer temperatures at night and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths among people aged between 60 and 69. They studied data from the Office for National Statistics on almost 40,000 adult deaths attributed to CVD for the months of June and July in every year between 2001 and 2015 in England and Wales because heatwaves in the UK are most frequent and intense during these months. The results, published in the journal BMJ Open, showed that after allowing for certain variables, a 1C rise in the usual summer night temperature was associated with a 3.1% increase in the risk of CVD mortality among men aged 60 to 64, but not older men or women in either age group. Researchers also examined US data for King County, Washington, a similarly sea-facing region, at parallel latitude to England and Wales, with comparable land-ocean atmospheric properties and similarly low prevalence of residential air conditioning. The US data on about 500 deaths only included men. In King County, a 1C rise was associated with a 4.8% increased risk of CVD mortality among those aged 65 and under, but not in older men. The findings are worrying, the authors said, because in recent years, regions such as the ones studied have experienced a proportionate rise in night-time rather than daytime summer heat intensity. The study was observational, so cannot establish causality. The researchers also acknowledged some limitations. However, the strengths of the research included its large population size data and use of rigorous national mortality and meteorological data. “Considering the growing likelihood of extreme summers in western USA and UK, our results invite preventive population health initiatives and novel urban policies aimed at reducing future risk of CVD events,” the authors concluded.",News/Society,Hotter nights increase risk of death from heart disease for men in early 60s,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/28/hotter-nights-summer-increase-risk-death-heart-disease-men-early-60s
3/29/2022,"The Morrison government fast-tracked visas for 11 Afghan army officers who studied at Australian defence colleges after officials warned Peter Dutton a failure to help them would generate negative news stories, documents reveal. A briefing to the defence minister, obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, said the group was “of high profile and at considerable risk” of Taliban retribution. In the document, written five days after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, a senior defence official noted there was already “substantial media attention” on the Australian government’s treatment of its former Afghan staff. If the Afghan national army (ANA) officers who studied in Australia were not granted visas, “there is an increased likelihood of negative media attention as the window to evacuate closes,” the document said. Advocates held grave fears that some of this group were left behind during the chaotic and dangerous evacuation mission, saying they are aware of two members and their families who made it to Australia. The departments of defence and home affairs declined to say how many of this group are in Australia now. The newly released document sheds light on the difficulty of the last-ditch evacuation mission, which was launched after the fall of the Afghan capital to the Taliban in mid-August. It is likely to trigger fresh questions about why the government did not act sooner to fly out people who may have been at risk because of their connection to Australia. In the briefing to Dutton on 20 August, a senior Department of Defence official raised concerns about the “particular risk” facing about 11 ANA officers who were either current or former students at Australian defence colleges. The briefing also shows that the Department of Defence was being approached, at that time, “by large numbers of Afghan nationals with varying degrees of connection to the department and the ADF, seeking assistance to come to Australia”. “Beyond our cohort of locally engaged staff who have been certified and who have, or are in the process of receiving, a visa, we believe that we owe the strongest obligation to this group,” the brief said. The same day, Dutton agreed to sign a letter requesting that the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, grant emergency visas to the 11 officers and their families “to allow their expatriation during the current operation”. Glenn Kolomeitz, a director at GAP Veteran & Legal Services, represented a range of people seeking help to leave Afghanistan, including former ANA officers who studied in Australia. He said he was aware of two of this group who made it into Australia with their families. “A couple of those and their families managed to secure visas and evacuations very, very quickly – more quickly than any of our other locally engaged employees, staff or any other of our Afghan clients,” Kolomeitz said. He said that even in the middle of the evacuation “debacle” it was “positive that the government recognised the impact on our ADF members and our veterans of leaving these particular ANA officers who studied here with us to the hands of the Taliban for retribution”. But he said veterans were genuinely concerned that there remained “plenty of locally engaged interpreters and others who worked for and with Australia who are in exactly the same position now”. “We are leaving people behind who are at risk because of their work with us,” Kolomeitz said. The ADF ended up flying 4,168 evacuees out of Kabul, including 2,984 Afghans with visas, in the second half of August. The government ramped up offers of emergency visas amid practical challenges with visa processing in Afghanistan at that time. On Tuesday the Australian Council for International Development will urge the Australian government to provide at least $100m in assistance for Afghanistan a year, amid warnings that two in five children under the age of five face acute malnutrition. “Afghanistan faces a total economic collapse,” the group’s chief executive, Marc Purcell, said.
