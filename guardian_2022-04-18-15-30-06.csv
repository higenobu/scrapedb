4/18/2022,"Today’s puzzles begin with a low-fi version of Countdown: you roll five dice and using the basic arithmetical operations aim to get as close as possible to a target number. Then the questions get a bit trickier, and a bit more interesting. 1. Five nice dice A roll of five dice produces the numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. i) By combining the numbers using +, –, x and ÷, what is the closest you can get to the target of 55? ii) What is the largest whole number you can reach? iii) What is the largest whole number you can reach using only subtraction? (tip: it’s a positive number.) iv) What is the largest whole number you can reach using only division? Clarification: By combining the numbers I mean creating an expression using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (and as many brackets as you like.) For example, using the five numbers above, you could combine them in this way: ((5x6)+ 4) ÷ (3 – 1), which is equal to 17. You can use as many, or as few, plus, minus, times and division signs as you like. 2. Five nicer dice You roll five standard dice. i) What is the probability the five numbers can be combined to reach 0? ii) What’s the probability that the maximum result is obtained simply by multiplying them all together? iii) What’s the probability that the maximum result is obtained uniquely by multiplying them all together? iv) What is the probability that the five random dice cannot be combined to reach any of the targets from 33 to 99? Today’s problems are adapted from Math Games with Bad Drawings, the new book by superstar maths communicator Ben Orlin. It is a beautifully produced compendium of maths games that is destined to be a classic of popular maths literature. Like his previous books it has charming sketches of stick figures all the way through. The idea of the book is that maths can be playful – and social. Almost all the games he writes about are for two or more players, and are to be enjoyed by anyone aged 10 and up. For example, the game from which today’s puzzles are adapted is as follows. One player calls out a number between 33 and 99. This is the target number. The player then rolls five dice. Now all players have two minutes to get as close to the target number. Your score is your distance from the target, and, evidently, lower scores are better. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. NO SPOILERS. Instead, please discuss your favourite maths-based games. Thanks to Ben Orlin. Math Games with Bad Drawings is out now. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. I’m the author of several books of puzzles, most recently the Language Lover’s Puzzle Book. I also give school talks about maths and puzzles (online and in person). If your school is interested please get in touch.

4/18/2022,"In recent years, I’ve heard members of the older generation complain that it is no longer considered acceptable to ask a younger person whether or not they have children. It’s true that this isn’t polite, especially during small talk with a stranger. They may as well be saying: “So, tell me all about the inner workings of your/your partner’s uterus.” Personally, I used to dread this question, even more so when it was framed as, “Do you have a family?” Of course I do, I just haven’t birthed any of them. People’s feelings on procreation are often complicated, sometimes painful, and always deeply personal. In the context of increasing panic about the birthrate, the question of having children – or not, as it may be – is even more loaded, because it intersects with so many other factors in our lives: health, finances, employment status, gender or sexuality, housing, relationship status, and so on. These are not things you necessarily want to delve into over the course of a casual conversation. Or, perhaps – revolutionary as it might sound – you simply don’t want to have children, and it’s your right to not want to discuss that or be interrogated about that. The fact that the word “childless” seems to be going out of fashion is largely to be celebrated. It positions having a child as the default, and has the power to be intensely wounding. As a word, it carries with it a feeling of “lacking”, when that is certainly not everyone’s experience. This stigma is why the term “childfree” is increasingly becoming the default in media reporting after being popularised on internet messageboards in recent years. I was interested in how people without children may feel about that, so I’ve been asking them on- and offline whether they see the use of “childfree” as an improvement. People who had chosen not to have children generally preferred to be referred to as “childfree”, but those whose “childlessness” was involuntary, due to infertility, bereavement or life circumstances, felt erased by it. Many complained that both terms positioned having children as the default, when it shouldn’t be (“I’m just a woman living life,” said one respondent). Why define by deficit? Indeed, I’d say the overwhelming majority disliked both words, with one being seen as stigmatising and the other gleeful and nasty in its implication that parents somehow need “liberating”. Others took issue with the term “childfree” because it has become the chosen moniker for an online community with a too often misogynistic undercurrent, according to several I spoke to. I checked out a few subreddits, and luckily my skin is as thick as rhino’s hide after more than a decade of newspaper journalism, because some of what I read was pretty unpleasant, including several threads about people finding pregnant women “disgusting” and how looking at them makes them “feel sick”. Sobering reading for someone who was pregnant at the time. After reading these forums, and then cleansing my palate with several videos of babies and kittens interacting, I can understand why a person without children may not want to be associated with a community that often expresses strong dislike, even hate, for children and their parents. I can understand why communities for those who have difficult feelings about pregnancy (including phobias) need to exist, but some comments were profoundly misogynistic. After all, we are all part of a collective and a community, and not having your own children doesn’t mean that your life is “childfree”, and that the people you love haven’t made a different choice to your own. There are many ways to care for children, from being an uncle or godparent to fostering, step-parenting, volunteering or working with them. Perhaps we need to focus less on the act of “having” a child and more on the act of parenting. There’s also the fact that, for many people, including myself before I became a mother, we are neither “childless” nor “childfree”, but hover somewhere in between – or oscillate between the two. I have had days where I have spent time with a baby and felt desperately, profoundly childless, only to take to the dancefloor that evening after a dangerous fourth martini and feel blissfully, hedonistically childfree. Perhaps that’s one reason why – when absolutely necessarily – “doesn’t have children” is the kindest, most neutral descriptor we can hope for. Though we can also hope to be moving away from one’s parenting status needing to be defined at all, especially for women, who still face this question far more frequently than men. Language matters, and as ever it often says more about us and our assumptions than we realise. What is working: My response to the mother of all impertinent of questions has often proved very effective, so I thought I might share it here. “That’s a very personal question,” I reply, looking the querent dead in the eye. It usually has the desired effect. What isn’t: At risk of causing paroxysms of revulsion among the childfree Reddit community from being forced to imagine the following scene, I had the most appalling bath while heavily pregnant: lukewarm, as medically recommended (I used my husband’s homebrew thermometer to check it was below 37C). The baby first kicked to the Adagietto in Mahler’s Fifth, so I thought I’d try the whole symphony, not realising how bellicose and bombastic it was. “Are you OK in there?” my husband asked, as I sat in a cold bath listening to a cacophony of trumpets. “You sound like you should be piloting a spitfire.” Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"Whether you’re ‘childless’ or ‘childfree’, you shouldn't have to talk about it | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/18/childless-childfree-child
4/18/2022,"Schools are cramped not just because of bigger class sizes but because pupils themselves have got bigger, according to teachers who say they feel as if they’ve “entered the land of the giants” when they walk into class. Children are “crammed” into chairs and desks that are too small, and have to put their feet in the aisles, delegates at the annual conference of the NASUWT teachers’ union were told on Sunday during a debate on class sizes. Part of the problem is cramped school buildings, many of which date to the 1970s, the conference was told. Meanwhile, three-quarters of teachers who were polled said class sizes were increasing, while more than a third (37%) said numbers had grown significantly. “It’s not just the number of pupils in the room, it’s also about the increase in size of the pupils themselves,” said Elaine Paling, a national executive member representing Buckinghamshire, Milton Keynes and Oxfordshire. “When I look around [my school] now it’s not the fact that these rooms have shrunk it’s that the students have grown.” In the 1970s, she said the average teenage boy was shorter, slighter and had smaller feet than today. “Now they are crammed into chairs and desks which are absolutely not suitable for them … and where do they put their feet? In the aisle.” Another delegate, Fergal McGuckin, of North Down in Northern Ireland, agreed: “The size of pupils is increasing. I feel like I’ve just entered the land of the giants when I walk into some of my A-level classes. As someone who’s a standard five foot eight, I really do feel vertically challenged in those environments.” Children in the UK have been getting taller and heavier for generations thanks to better nutrition. A survey of 5,000 seven to 16-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, released by the Office for National Statistics and the Centre for Statistical Education at Nottingham Trent University, found that an average 15-year-old boy at the start of the 21st century, at 5ft 8in, was around nine inches taller than someone of his age would have been in 1837. The average British foot is reported to have increased by two shoe sizes in the past 40 years, according to the College of Podiatry. In 1970, men’s feet were size eight on average and women size four, but now the average male wears a size 10 and the average female wears a size six.",News/Education,"Bigger classes?

4/18/2022,"Voters in Scotland, Wales and parts of England will vote in local elections on 5 May. All London borough councils will be up for grabs and seven areas of England will elect mayors. Since the last time most of these seats were contested in 2018, the political landscape has changed significantly. In England, both the Labour and Conservative parties have replaced their UK leaders, while the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and a cost of living crisis have all hit. Although local issues will certainly carry a weight, the elections in England will be seen as a test for Boris Johnson’s leadership in wake of the Partygate scandal and the government’s handling of the cost of living crisis. Recent polls show that Labour has a slight lead over the Conservatives. In Scotland, Labour’s status is also the dominant theme. There, Labour hopes to replace the Tories as the country’s second largest party behind the SNP; successive opinion polls this year suggest it is on course to do so, with Partygate severely denting unionist backing for the Tories. National polling, however, is only of limited use in local elections, which only happen across some parts of the country. In England, most of the seats will be contested in London – 1,817 seats across 32 boroughs – where Labour controls the vast majority of councils. Outside the capital, a wide variety of councils are up for election: 33 metropolitan borough councils covering 904 seats; 21 unitary authorities, with 627 seats; 60 district councils (1,011 seats). Six mayors will also be elected in London boroughs, and one in the South Yorkshire Combined Authority. In Scotland, there are 1,219 seats up for grabs in 32 unitary councils, while for Wales it is 1,234 seats in 22 councils. The fact that many English metropolitan boroughs, as well as every London council, are up for election means the Conservatives could struggle in traditional Labour strongholds. In total, Labour will be defending 69 councils across England, Wales and Scotland, compared to the Conservatives’ 47. The Northern Ireland assembly election will also take place on 5 May. Polling puts Sinn Féin, a party that campaigns for a united Ireland, on course for a historic victory, becoming the largest party in Stormont. With the next general election rapidly approaching, Labour will be hoping that these elections show signs of a bounce back that they can build up. To do this, Labour will need to make up ground in the constituencies they lost in 2019 – several of which overlap with councils that have seats up in the 2022 local elections. In total, there are 11 councils in England and Wales that the Guardian has assessed as essential for Labour to see at least some gains if they are to have serious hope of returning to power. All of these saw Conservative flips in the 2019 general election and hold opportunities for Labour to at least wrestle full control away from the Tories. This is especially true in the four Welsh councils, where Labour will hope to build momentum after strong Welsh parliament election results last year. If Labour fails to make gains in these seats, especially after the latest Partygate developments which saw Johnson fined for breaking his own coronavirus regulations, there will be serious questions asked of Keir Starmer’s ability to win the next general election.",News/Politics,"Local elections 2022: a visual guide on what to expect in England, Scotland and Wales",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/18/local-elections-2022-a-visual-guide-on-what-to-expect-in-england-scotland-and-wales
4/18/2022,"In February I went to the Tesco Mobile outlet in my nearest Tesco store and ordered an upgraded handset – an iPhone. It was for my grandson, who took over my late wife’s Tesco Mobile number. I paid an extra £29.40, completed the necessary paperwork and was informed that the phone would be delivered to me by DPD. Three days later I personally took delivery of the box, but when I opened it up, instead of the phone, there was a power bank (a portable charger) and a Tesco sim card. Naturally I took this up with Tesco Mobile, but the company refuses to accept that this happened and has maintained that the correct item was delivered. I have since made a formal complaint enclosing photographs of the packaging and items received, but again this was rebuffed. I was told by Tesco Mobile to take the matter to the ombudsman service, but I’ve just been informed that the ombudsman can’t intervene because it is a handset matter, and Tesco has objected. I am left paying for a phone that we don’t have. I feel I have been treated shabbily by the company - the inference being that I am dishonest and am trying to defraud them. I am a 75-year-old former police detective sergeant, who worked at the Bank of England for many years in a position of trust, and have no reason or inclination to commit fraud on Tesco Mobile or anyone else. Can you help? BK, east London I was somewhat surprised to receive this letter as we get relatively few complaints about Tesco Mobile. It is arguably the sector’s top provider. That said, it clearly has not handled this well. Your phone was most likely stolen at the processing stage: the thief replaces the phone with something of a similar weight, which will then pass any en-route weight checks. It is not an uncommon occurrence. The problem with these cases is that they are very difficult for the consumer to prove in their favour unless you open the parcel in the presence of the courier. I accept this is often easier said than done, but it has to be done because it stops these disputes from happening. Most drivers will wait two minutes while you open the package. Tesco Mobile declined to comment on this case, but is now sending you the phone that you originally ordered. Given your work history, I am very surprised that it took my intervention at all.

4/18/2022,"Your film’s plot needs to be moved along, perhaps, or a close connection between characters has to be revealed. Maybe our hero just needs a moment to mourn. Time for a closeup of a nicely framed photograph. A simple shot, you’d think – but no. There are so many examples of terribly edited photos that keen-eyed film fan Justin Gerber went viral with a Twitter thread of the botched images he spotted in a single year, spanning three decades of cinema from 1990’s The Amityville Curse to this year’s The Adam Project. Gerber found in-film portraits where faces didn’t match their heads, body parts were out of proportion, the lighting was inconsistent and backdrops were unashamedly fake. This phenomenon popped up time and time again, irrespective of the films’ genre, release date or scale of production. But why had such poorly formed images been left in for all to see? “Scream 2” (1997) pic.twitter.com/eKT5jv5iXN “Sometimes it’s just kind of a nightmare,” assistant art director Seth Rutledge says about the process of putting such photos together. “The scripts get written without any idea what exists or not.” Rutledge has worked on several notable TV shows in recent years, from Snowpiercer to Batwoman and Supergirl, and is currently in charge of sourcing portraits for a Disney+ teen romance movie. That means creating lots of phone selfies and family photos designed to dot around the characters’ houses. “Primarily I do sets and locations, which is how I get involved in doing these Photoshop pictures of people in backgrounds,” he says. “Often the art department will need something and be like, ‘Hey, can you make this background picture of this guy’s kids that we never see on the TV?’” If the script calls for a cosy shot of two characters embracing, Rutledge has to make that happen. The obvious solution is to arrange a photoshoot with the actors, but there are conflicting schedules to consider. If the actors can’t make it on set at the same time during preproduction, they’ll be asked to submit portraits of themselves instead that can be spliced together. But this doesn’t always go to plan either. Veteran art director Dan Yarhi says: “You ask them for photographs, and then their agent sends you actor’s headshots. It’s like, ‘No, you’re supposed to be playing a homeless guy!’” Yarhi has been working across art departments in film and TV since the early 1970s and his team were responsible for the framed photos that appeared in Resident Evil: Retribution in 2012 – which turned up in Gerber’s thread as an example of questionable editing. “You have to remember, too, that things happen on a set spontaneously,” Yarhi says. “They do a camera blocking first thing in the morning, and then sometimes I come back in the afternoon, and they’ve turned the set around and are now pointing another way.” The Change Up (2011) pic.twitter.com/e2C9yA7KLd This can cause a headache. Imagine prepping a photo frame designed to sit out of focus on a distant shelf, then an improvising actor picks it up while the camera is rolling. The photo has just been upgraded from set dressing to an action prop with nowhere to hide. Before 4K quality came along people didn’t really notice this stuff. Now we have HD TV that any keen viewer can pause and inspect, so small cracks in production stand out like dry ravines, and the film industry has had to adapt. “Up until the early 2000s no one cared, and just gradually over time, it’s getting to be more of a problem,” Rutledge says. But he wants to make something clear: this isn’t the result of lazy or uninspired work. “Everyone I’ve ever seen working on these things really cares, they want to do the best they can,” he says. “When these things happen it’s either because no one had time or no one had the necessary resources to get it done right, and somebody probably feels bad about it.” “It is wows per dollar,” says Yarhi. “It’s, ‘Where are you going to put the money where it pays off?’” And for many productions, prop pictures just aren’t top priority. “Please remember that they are called motion pictures and are meant to be viewed on a large screen, not to be stopped and zoomed into. I will remind you that the Mona Lisa is famous for her smile, not the soft-focus dodgy background of the painting.”",Arts/Film,What’s wrong with this picture?

4/18/2022,"Q We are two academics – with one child – moving to Oxford after the summer. My partner has a permanent contract in Europe and I will have a full-time position in Oxford for the next three years. Because of the nature of the academic job market, we have not yet bought a property because we don’t know where I might end up having a permanent position. However, rent in Oxford is rather high and, together with childcare costs, it will make saving money rather challenging. I am asking myself if it would be worth buying there, instead of renting, in order to save money. We have enough savings for a decent down payment to buy a two-bedroom property with a garden in Oxford. The likelihood of us staying in Oxford after this three-year period is close to zero, so we know that we have to face another move (somewhere) in the near future. However, because of the high demand for rental properties in Oxford, I do think that we could rent the property out while we decide where we move next and before selling it down the line.PC A I happen to live on a terrace of two-bedroom houses (three with a loft conversion) with a garden in Oxford and I can confirm that renting in Oxford costs a lot. But so, too, does buying – as I can also confirm – because Oxford is one of the most expensive places to buy property outside London. And it’s unlikely to get cheaper as, according to a report in last week’s Oxford Times “house prices in Oxford have increased by more than 12% in the first quarter of the year, making it harder for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder and home owners to move up”. A lot depends on where in Oxford you want to buy, so if you pick the right area, it could well be that a two-bedroom house with a garden is an affordable option and given that you are planning to be in the house for at least two years, buying is a sensible choice. It is also a sensible choice in terms of monthly costs as you are right that monthly mortgage payments can often be less than the equivalent amount of rent but a lot depends on the size of mortgage. But that assumes that you can get a mortgage. Because of your unconventional pattern of earnings, you would be well advised to get help from an independent mortgage adviser who knows which lender will lend to people on short-term contracts.

4/18/2022,"At the 2019 election, Labor’s vote was hurt by a campaign accusing it of wanting to introduce a “death tax”. Although Labor did propose to cut tax refunds for excess franking credits, a policy that exempted pensioners, it was not true that it intended to introduce an inheritance tax. Now claims that older Australians’s savings are at risk are back in twin scare campaigns: from Labor, arguing that pensioners will be put on the cashless debit card; and from the Coalition, that the retiree tax may not be dead. Labor has been campaigning on the cashless debit card for some time. In July 2021 the party launched a website claiming the “Liberal-National government wants to expand the cashless debit card to include all pensioners”. Labor MP Justine Elliott has been one of the most strident in making the claim. Similar claims have been made in Facebook ads by MPs including Brian Mitchell, Anika Wells and Pat Conroy, shadow resources minister Madeleine King, and Dickson candidate Ali France. The Liberal party advertised in late March and early April on Facebook and Instagram warning voters “don’t trust Labor with your retirement savings” and calling on voters to sign a petition to “stop Labor’s retiree tax”, although the link is broken. The two ads have so far only had up to 65,000 impressions, but could be a sign the Coalition is testing its message for a broader campaign. A Liberal party campaign website with a petition warning that “Labor’s retirement tax will hurt retirees and low income earners” has been active since March 2019 despite Labor ditching the policy after the 2019 election. Labor cites statements such as when the social services minister, Anne Ruston, told Seven News in February 2020 that “we’re seeking to put all income management on to the universal platform, which is the cashless debit card”, and a statement to Nine newspapers that the card may become a “more universal” platform. The government also passed legislation extending the cashless debit card in the four existing trial sites, which defined the age pension as a “restrictable payment”. The Liberal party ads argue “Anthony Albanese has consistently supported higher taxes during his political career, including the Retiree Tax”. The cashless debit card quarantines 80% of welfare recipients’ payments to a card that cannot be used for gambling or to purchase alcohol, or to withdraw cash. Labor has argued this causes harms like preventing people being “able to pay cash to buy cheap food at the local market, second-hand goods, a meal or a beer at the RSL, or give cash to their grandkids”. The retiree tax claim hurt Labor at the last election and is being used to support the generalisation other taxes may rise under Labor. Ruston really did say that, but her comments were referring to moving existing welfare recipients on income management off the basics card and onto the cashless debit card. The latter is accepted at more retailers and works like a normal debit card, unless a person is trying to buy blocked products like alcohol or gambling. Asked if the card should be compulsory, Ruston said: “I’m not going to pre-empt that.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After moving people onto the cashless debit card “I think then the conversation needs to be had about what are the advantages of this card are, and it’s up to us to go and sell those advantages in the hope the Australian community will see the value of it”, she said. Currently, age pensioners may volunteer to be on the cashless debit card. The legislation which defined it as a “restrictable payment” only allowed pensioners to join on a voluntary basis, with one exception. The power to force pensioners onto the card was limited to remote communities in Cape York, Queensland if they were directed to use the card on the recommendation of the Family Responsibilities Commission, an Indigenous-led statutory body independent of government. When that bill went through the Senate in December 2020, the government voted for a second reading amendment stating that “no recipient of the age pension … will be placed on the cashless debit card, with the exception of those who volunteer or are referred” by child protection, social workers or the commission. In October 2021, social services department officials told Senate estimates the department had provided “no advice” on the question of requiring pensioners to be placed on the card. In the same month Ruston said: “The Morrison government will not force age pensioners onto the cashless debit card. We were never going to, and never will.” Verdict: Although at one time the Coalition left this open, it has since ruled it out. No. Labor has proposed scrapping the card and will capitalise on the fear of its expanded use. On Monday the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was asked if Labor would stop making the claim. He replied: Absolutely not. This is a key issue. Wherever you go in Australia pensioners are worried about Scott Morrison and Anne Ruston’s comments about the expansion of this scheme nationwide. We make absolutely no apology whatsoever for standing up for the pensioners of this country who are petrified that this cashless debit card will be extended to them. The ad strongly implies that the retiree tax might still be Labor policy, which is incorrect. But it does so through vague warnings not to trust Labor and a statement about the past that is true, that Albanese supported it (when it was Labor policy). Yes. Australia’s commonwealth electoral legislation does not contain any truth in political advertising provisions, beyond a ban on misleading voters about the process of voting. The idea of banning lies in political advertising is popular and the death tax misinformation campaign did spark calls for such laws, which exist in South Australia, but weren’t enacted federally.",News/Australia news,Factcheck: is there any truth to scare campaigns about the cashless debit card and retiree tax?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/18/factcheck-is-there-any-truth-to-scare-campaigns-about-the-cashless-debit-card-and-retiree-tax
4/18/2022,"An influential conservative group that includes two Trump allies who helped push lies about voter fraud in 2020 is spearheading “election integrity” summits in battleground states, advocating for expanded poll watching, “clean” voter rolls and other measures watchdogs say could curb voting rights to help Republican candidates. The Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI) “election integrity network” is run by the veteran GOP lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who helped to spread misinformation about supposed election fraud in 2020. Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s last White House chief of staff, is a senior partner of the CPI and reportedly had a lead role in at least one of its summits. Mitchell, CPI’s senior legal fellow, has hosted multi-day summits, seeking to mobilize hundreds of conservative activists for elections this year in Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania, all states that Trump lost to Joe Biden, and Florida, which he won. CPI is slated to hold summits this spring in Virginia, Michigan and Wisconsin, as it seeks to build “election integrity” infrastructure in swing states. Powerful groups on the right such as Heritage Action and Tea Party Patriots Action have participated in previous summits. Ties between CPI and Trump were underscored last July, when the former president’s Save America leadership Pac donated $1m to the group weeks after the House voted to create a committee to investigate the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 by Trump loyalists seeking to disrupt certification of Biden’s election victory. Mitchell’s election summits began in February this year. Previously, she and other conservatives worked with legislators in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Texas to spur the passage of voting laws, including new voter ID requirements and curbs on absentee voting, that seem heavily aimed at Black voters, voting rights advocates say. A participant at the CPI Arizona event said falsehoods about voter fraud in 2020 were voiced to gin-up enthusiasm for more aggressive election monitoring in 2022. “The event definitely used the false allegations of fraud in 2020 as a call to action to rally support for vigilant engagement this year in the election process,” the participant told the Guardian, speaking on condition of anonymity. “There was a large focus on recruiting precinct officials to watch the polls and all of the other processes associated with elections.” Voting rights watchdogs voiced strong concern about the CPI summits. “Ongoing efforts to promote false claims of widespread voter fraud are dangerous and damaging to our democracy,” Wendy Weiser, vice-president for democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice, said. “There is a multi-pronged attack on the core principles of our democracy in the name of election integrity. The country’s history with these kinds of so-called ‘election integrity’ operations makes clear that they create a serious risk of racial targeting, voter intimidation, and vote suppression.” The push to forge state election “integrity” networks is occurring while Mitchell and Meadows face congressional scrutiny and other investigation of their efforts to help Trump stay in power. Mitchell participated in a 2 January 2021 call with the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump urged the state official to “find” 11,780 votes, in order to overturn Biden’s win in the state. The Fulton county district attorney and a special grand jury are investigating whether Trump and others broke laws barring the solicitation of election fraud and other statutes in Georgia. Last month, Mitchell was subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee that is investigating the Capitol attack. Meadows was a “keynote speaker” at a two-day CPI Georgia summit in February, where he was scheduled to discuss “what happened in Georgia in 2020 and what we must do to protect future elections”, according to the Citizen Times, a paper in Meadows’ home state, North Carolina. Meadows is now under scrutiny for alleged voter fraud in 2020. North Carolina officials announced last week the four-term congressman had been removed from voter rolls pending the outcome of an investigation prompted by a New Yorker report that in 2020 he registered to vote using an address he never lived at. In March, several days before the North Carolina inquiry was announced, Meadows pulled out of the CPI’s Arizona summit, where he had been billed as a top speaker. He has reportedly not participated in other events. Meadows also faces a criminal contempt of Congress referral to the US justice department, for refusing to comply fully with requests from the January 6 committee. CPI declined to answer queries about the summits and about Meadows’ role. Watchdog groups say the summits are sham efforts based on the lie that the 2020 election was subject to widespread fraud. “The people who perpetrated the fraudulent notion that the 2020 election was stolen are capitalizing on the confusion they deliberately sowed to undermine the safety and security of future elections and, not coincidentally, rake in money in the process,” Melanie Sloan, a senior adviser to the government watchdog group American Oversight, said. Some details of CPI’s gameplan for the 2022 elections have been revealed by websites promoting state summits. In Pennsylvania, a three-day summit in late March was advertised to include sessions on how to form a “local election integrity taskforce”; how to protect “vulnerable voters from leftist activists”; “researching your local election office”; “monitoring voting equipment and systems”; and more. Some “election integrity” meetings have drawn powerful conservative groups such as FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity that have to varying degrees amplified false claims about the 2020 elections. Some groups at the summits have been bankrolled by donors including the oil and gas billionaire Charles Koch, billionaire businessman Richard Uihlein and the conservative Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, where Mitchell is a board member. CPI gatherings have also been attended by GOP figures including candidates running for governor in Pennsylvania and the sitting Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. According to the Center for Media and Democracy, at a secretive January meeting with leaders of Tea Party Patriots and conservative groups from several states, Mitchell and CPI distributed a “citizens’ guide to building an election integrity infrastructure” to promote the summits and her message. Mitchell was also tapped last March by FreedomWorks to spearhead what it billed as a $10m drive to push tougher voting laws in more than half a dozen states and to fight Democratic proposals to make voting easier. Some watchdog groups say the CPI summits pose several threats to voting rights in 2022. Sloan, of American Oversight, said the CPI agenda had echoes of “Jim Crow-style voter suppression techniques, and a recipe for more verbal and physical threats against election administration officials”, similar to ones that occurred in Georgia and other states after the 2020 elections. Weiser, of the Brennan Center, warned: “There is a growing risk that in the name of election integrity, partisans and vigilantes will mobilize to intimidate voters and thwart their participation.”",News/US news,‘Election integrity summits’ aim to fire up Trump activists over big lie,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/18/election-integrity-summits-conservative-partnership-institute
4/18/2022,"The UK streaming boom is officially over after the number of homes with services such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney+ fell in the first quarter, as the cost of living crisis forced hundreds of thousands of streaming fans to slim down their subscriptions to just a few favourites. The number of UK homes that have at least one paid-for subscription streaming service fell by 215,000 in the first quarter – ending a decade of almost uninterrupted growth in the popularity of streaming services – as households cut budgets to cope as inflation runs at a three-decade high. “With many streaming services having witnessed significant revenue growth during the height of Covid, this moment will be sobering,” said Dominic Sunnebo, the global insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, the publisher of the Entertainment on Demand report. “The evidence from these findings suggests that British households are now proactively looking for ways to save, and the subscription video-on-demand (SVoD) market is already seeing the effects of this.” The unprecedented number of streaming services that are now in the market, at a time when living standards are forecast to suffer their biggest decline since the 1950s, means that ballooning home entertainment budgets that were sacrosanct during pandemic lockdown conditions are now being cut. The Kantar Worldpanel report found that 16.9m UK households had at least one subscription service – although the average is 2.4 – at the end of the first quarter. While there were 1.29m new subscriptions to SVoD services in the UK in the first three months, this was outweighed by 1.51m cancellations, with more than half a million of those attributed to “money saving”. Cutting back on streaming budgets looks set to increase, with the proportion of consumers planning to cancel at least one SVoD stating the reason as “wanting to save money” hitting an all-time high of 38%. “In times of financial uncertainty, services need to be indispensable in subscribers’ minds,” said Sunnebo. “As a result, it’s now more critical than ever that SVoD providers demonstrate to consumers how their services are indispensable in the home in what has become a heavily competitive market.” The report found that cost-conscious streamers were identifying Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video as the “must-have” services, with the world’s two most popular platforms proving to have the lowest rate of customers leaving in the first quarter. Prime Video’s action series, Reacher, and Netflix dramas Ozark and Inventing Anna proved to be the most popular shows on SVoD services in the UK in the first quarter. In contrast, Disney+, the world’s third-biggest service, saw its churn rate (the rate at which customers cancelled subscriptions) triple quarter-on-quarter to 12%. Sky’s Now TV, Discovery+ and BritBox, the joint venture between ITV and the BBC, also had “significant jumps” in churn rates in the quarter. “Netflix and Amazon can be seen to be the last to go when households are forced to prioritise spend,” said Sunnebo. “Among homes that subscribe to streaming services, Netflix is consistently ranked number one in importance regardless of what platform it is put up against. But for the likes of Disney+, the implications are significant as it must turn its attention to replacing existing services that households subscribe to now it is no longer always going to be seen as another incremental addition.” Nevertheless, even the world’s biggest streaming service, which on Tuesday will report its first quarter results and provide insight into the strength of the market in the coming months, is feeling the pressure of the post-pandemic slowdown. In January, Netflix forecast that it would add just 2.5 million new subscribers globally in the first quarter, its worst start to a year in over a decade and confirming that in 2021, it added the fewest subscribers since 2015. Last year, Netflix attracted the lowest number of new UK subscribers since launching in 2012.",News/Media,Streaming subscriptions in decline as UK households cut budgets,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/18/streaming-subscriptions-in-decline-as-uk-households-cut-budgets
4/18/2022,"Rennes is a great place for foodies. The speciality is a galette-saucisse – Breton street food. It’s a sausage wrapped in a buckwheat galette, maybe with onions, but strictly no sauce (if you’re Breton). It’s sold in the main market in Place des Lices, in smaller Les Halles market, and by the many food trucks outside the football stadium on match days. My restaurant, Coquille, is on rue Nantaise, which has become a little gastronomic hub close to the city centre. We serve dishes using local produce, such as fish, seafood and vegetables from small market gardeners, but the cuisine is influenced by my time working in Asia. Also on the street is the very traditional Café Breton, a real institution with an extensive menu of classics and modern dishes. There’s also a super Thai restaurant, Chawp Shop Kphet. Pierre Restaurant de Copains, run by a friend who was a finalist in Top Chef [the French version of MasterChef], is a lively, trendy place to hang out. You could spend days eating on just this street. The Musée de Bretagne is really interesting – a journey through the history of Brittany and its people – and has some works many will recognise, including sketches by greats such as Picasso and Gauguin. The most famous is Le Nouveau-né, by 17th-century artist Georges de la Tour. There are also pieces by artists inspired by Brittany, such as Narcisse Chaillou and Octave Penguilly, plus regular exhibitions of modern art and sculpture. Rennes is pretty small, so it’s hard to pick out a particular neighbourhood, but the area around Place Saint-Germain, just next to Saint-Germain church, is great. It has an attractive little square and good places to eat and shop; a new Metro line opening later this year will have a stop here. Behind the church is an amazing Japanese restaurant called Le Fuji: it has been there for about 30 years and is really authentic. For shopping there’s a fantastic bookshop, Librairie Le Failler, which does interesting editions. And across the river, interesting stores on rue Vasselot include Wakatépé, which only sells ethical goods – organic cotton and other sustainable clothing, and vegan shoes. The main park in Rennes is Parc du Thabor, which dates from the 18th century and is on the highest hill in the city. When it first opened, only men were admitted. It has formal gardens, a bandstand and an aviary, but there’s a prettier park nearby: Parc Oberthür is small but more charming, quieter and a bit wilder. It’s the garden of the old residence of print maker François-Charles Oberthür and his wife, Marie Hamelin. I love taking my kids there – it has some ancient trees and a lake with lots of birdlife. Bar Le Doujezu is a renowned hangout in Rennes. The name is a play on the words for “sweet Jesus” and it attracts a good mix of ages. The music is quite rocky and the bar top is set on an old Mercedes, which is cool. South of the centre, 1988 Live Club has guest DJs from all over Europe. It’s very popular with techno fans, but there’s something for everyone there. I’m a big fan of rock music, and even though we don’t really have a rock scene in France like in Britain, we do have a lot of concerts. I like The MeM, a little way out of town along the river: it’s a great venue, like a big-top tent, and there are some riverside bars, or guinguettes, nearby. A favourite, just reopened for summer 2022, is La Basse Cour, on an old farm. The Magic Hall hotel (doubles from €68 room-only) is a cool place to stay, especially if you’re a music fan. There’s a soundproofed music room and the bedrooms are all different. The downstairs area is like being in someone’s house, with an open kitchen and lounge area.

4/18/2022,"Xiaomi’s new top phone for the start of 2022 is the 12 Pro featuring high-end specs, svelte design and triple 50-megapixel cameras but at a decidedly premium price. “China’s Apple” as Xiaomi was once called, is more frequently known for top-spec phones that undercut the competition on price. But the 12 Pro is different – a direct challenger to Apple and Samsung costing £1,049, which is as much if not more than rivals. It certainly looks the part. The 6.73in OLED screen is super bright, vibrant and pin-sharp with a 120Hz refresh rate to keep everything smooth. The sides curve to a metal frame and a smooth frosted glass back with a protruding camera lump in the top left corner. The 12 Pro a large phone but feels great, is slightly lighter than some rivals and comparatively easy to grip. There’s a set of four speakers in the top and bottom of the phone, which are surprisingly good for a smartphone and not as easy to block with your hand when holding as some rivals. Screen: 6.73in QHD+ OLED (522ppi) 120Hz Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 RAM: 12GB of RAM Storage: 256GB Operating system: Miui 13 based on Android 12 Camera: Triple 50MP rear camera: wide, ultra-wide, 2x telephoto; 32MP selfie camera Connectivity: 5G, USB-C, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2 and location Water resistance: none Dimensions: 163.6 x 74.6 x 8.2mm Weight: 205g The 12 Pro has the same top Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip as the Oppo Find X5 Pro, OnePlus 10 Pro and most high-end Android phones launched in 2022 and performs similarly, capable of handling demanding tasks and games with aplomb. The battery life is a bit short compared with rivals. The 12 Pro lasted only 30 hours between charges, while most phones last at least 35 hours. That included about two hours on 5G and having actively using the screen for about four hours for mostly light tasks such as messaging, browsing, music and taking a couple of photos. Xiaomi rates the battery for at least 800 full-charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for about £12 plus labour. The phone is generally repairable, with screen fixes costing about £180 plus labour. Its predecessor scored only four out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability ranking. Xiaomi does not publish environmental impact assessments or offer trade-in or recycling schemes in the UK. The phone is not made of recycled materials. Miui 13 is Xiaomi’s customised version of Android 12. It is still a work in progress for western markets, full of little differences and oddities compared with Samsung, Google and other common brands, and certainly not the best version of Android available. It is highly customisable with options to change the way it looks and operates beyond what most rivals offer, from making it look and work like an iPhone to the more traditional Android way. But it took some digging through menus and tweaking settings to get it to work to my liking, after which it was fairly fast and attractive. Xiaomi will support the 12 Pro, with software updates including three big Android version upgrades and a total four years of security updates from the phone’s release. That is a year longer than last year’s model but behind Samsung’s five and Apple’s six-plus years of support. The phone has three 50-megapixel cameras on the back and a very capable 32MP selfie camera, which produces detailed photos but defaults to some degree of artificial skin-smoothing unless you turn it off manually. The main camera is the best of the bunch, producing sharp, well-detailed images with excellent colour balance and exposure, even in high-contrast scenes. Low-light performance is strong and video is excellent too. But the ultra-wide and 2x telephoto cameras are also good with consistent colour and exposure as you switch between the three cameras. The 2x zoom is weak compared with rivals, however, which often have 3, 5 or even 10x optical zooms. Extending beyond 2x with digital zoom quickly becomes full of artefacts. Overall, the 12 Pro’s camera is generally very good but let down by the limited optical zoom. The Xiaomi 12 Pro costs £1,049. For comparison, the Google Pixel 6 Pro costs £849, the OnePlus 10 Pro costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S21+ costs £949, the Oppo Find X5 Pro costs £1,049, the Galaxy S21 Ultra costs £1,149 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max costs £1,049. The 12 Pro is Xiaomi’s latest attempt to take on the best of Samsung and Apple at the top of the premium market, which delivers in some areas while falling short in others. It certainly looks the part, feels great, performs well and has the fastest charging currently available. The camera is pretty good too but lacks extended optical zoom, limited only to 2x magnification where others offer 3x or 4x for the same price. Xiaomi’s Miui software is improving but still feels geared towards enthusiasts. The biggest problems for the 12 Pro are relatively weak battery life and high cost. The buyer is simply getting less with the Xiaomi than with similar phones from OnePlus, Google, Samsung or Apple. Pros: good screen, top performance, super-fast charging, nice design, good camera, good speakers, decent in-screen fingerprint scanner. Cons: expensive, relatively short battery life, lack of extended optical zoom for the camera, only four years of software support guaranteed, no official water resistance rating.

4/18/2022,"The first single I ever boughtViva Forever by the Spice Girls on cassette, probably from the Woolworths on Edgware Road [north London], near where I grew up, which I used to love because it had a huge pick’n’mix. I remember the cover very vividly, with the Spice Girls all as fairies. They embodied so many brilliant qualities, like having fun and not taking life too seriously, which I try to live up to now. Spice World is genuinely one of my favourite films of all time. I was watching it the other day and I realised my sense of humour, even my approach to editing, all come from my obsession with the Spice Girls. My karaoke go-toLike a Virgin by Madonna. I’ve been doing it for many years now and it’s a crowdpleaser. My favourite time was when I went to Cuba with two of my friends when I was at uni. We were staying in this tiny village with a karaoke bar where all the locals went. I went on stage, performed that song, and won the night. The next day I was genuinely famous in the town. People were coming up to me and saying: “You’re the girl from karaoke night! Congratulations!” The best song to have sex to4’33” by John Cage. Which is four minutes and 33 seconds of silence. That’s all I need to say on that one! The song I can’t help singingMaterial Girl by Saucy Santana. It’s all over TikTok and now it’s just stuck in my head. I find myself saying “Material Girl” every five seconds, to everyone’s annoyance. It was a sound, it’s been a dance, now it’s flooded the internet and taken on a whole new life. Madonna was the original but now everyone is a Material Girl if they want to be. The song that I can’t standSomebody That I Used to Know by Gotye and Kimbra. I hate that song with a passion! When it first came out I was Interrailing and it was playing in every single country. I’d leave one, trying to escape that song, and it would just b. I want something a bit more upbeat – yet the lyrics could be interpreted that someone has died: “e playing in the next. God, I hate it! It’s honestly tragic, and also the video is so pretentious, and it just sounds like they’re moaning …. Ugh! It’s on so many lists of the “best songs ever written” and I just find it absolutely bizarre. Thankfully it doesn’t play that much any more. Where’s Gotye now, huh? The song I want played at my funeralThis one’s making me go a bit emotional – I never really think about my funeral, but it’s probably good to have it down in print: Say a Little Prayer by Aretha Franklin. Sad songs at my funeral would be just so depressing My current favourite songIn the Fire by Dave. I’m a really big Dave fan and I thought his performance at the Brits was incredible. I was lucky enough to be there: it was a huge production, with a lot of fire on stage and cameos from his collaborators. I just love when you’re watching a live performance and the artist brings people out on stage: the surprise, the energy you feel in the room, it genuinely makes you feel alive. I’ve grown up watching the Brits on TV. To be there in the room was a dream come true. My all-time favourite songBoth Sides Now by Joni Mitchell. My mum is her biggest fan; I’m named after the song Amelia. As a songwriter I don’t think anyone has ever come close. When anyone covers her songs, I’m always like: “Why?” You can’t. I love how mysterious she is. She stands out as being her own person. Every time I listen to Both Sides Now, I come away with a different meaning of what she’s saying about love. She doesn’t give you any answers, that’s the beauty of the song.

4/18/2022,"Jennifer Egan made her name with 2011’s Pulitzer-winning A Visit from the Goon Squad, a zig-zagging multigenerational saga centred on a multiplatinum record producer, Bennie Salazar. The quirky title referred to time’s ravages; Bennie, once part of 1970s outfit the Flaming Dildos, finds himself by the book’s discreetly futuristic end catering chiefly to “pointers”, tablet-wielding preschoolers whose tastes are the main driver of income in an industry altered beyond recognition.The Candy House, Egan’s follow-up, likewise hops around a large cast, this time from the 1990s to the 2030s, and once more has its eyes on the internet (the title refers to the seduction of free-to-use online services that sneakily turn us into the product, the echo of “the White House” presumably intended as a suggestion of where true power now lies). Like Goon Squad, it turns reality up a notch: this is an America in which – in a big-tech data grab – 21-year-olds are urged to upload their memories to guard against brain injury.Fertile ground, to be sure, but Egan has ideas to burn, and in this novel that’s what she does: her painstakingly constructed backdrop has barely any impact on the book’s drama, ill served by characters reduced to a trait. Remember 13-year-old Lincoln, whose obsessive cataloguing of “great rock’n’roll pauses” was recorded by his younger sister in a series of PowerPoint slides, Goon Squad’s most eye-catching narrative stunt? Lincoln, now in his mid-20s, gets his own chapter, but his hyper-attentiveness (previously the focus of a between-the-lines take on family life) is now just a distinguishing tic, as he longs for a colleague who “wears hair bands 24 percent of the time, scrunchies 28 percent of the time, and her hair loose 48 percent of the time”.Lincoln works in data mining (of course) and his storyline tees up some background action involving privacy activists known as “eluders”, who implant the brains of tech employees with “weevils”, electronic mind-control bugs that Egan keeps explaining until 20 pages from the end – a mark of how little the book’s gizmos ultimately contribute. There’s a shortage of the human moments that made Goon Squad fizz; Bennie feeling like a fish out of water at his upstate country club, for instance, or his assistant, Sasha, hiding her kleptomania. Here, action is seen as if through gauze: witness the 2032-set chapter about a “citizen agent” programmed by a shadowy government agency, told as 30 two-column pages of bulletpoint-like diktats from her handlers. You sense the novel’s laborious scaffolding when the narrator of a mid-1960s interlude asks: “How can I possibly know all this? I was only six... How dare I invent across chasms of gender, age, and cultural context?” She’s accessing a rapacious tech giant’s “Collective Consciousness”, it turns out – Google with knobs on, basically – and you suspect Egan only tells us that so she can write this: “Getting hold of that information is arguably more presumptuous than inventing it would have been. Pick your poison – if imagining isn’t allowed, then we’ll all have to resort to gray grabs” (a whizzy form of memory capture).That thought is more than enough on its own to feed the kind of topically chewy novel Egan seems to want to write. But after a long-winded set-up, it’s tossed aside, and the sense grows that the novel’s expository heft demands too much. By far the most enjoyable chapter unfolds as a late exchange of emails between various Goon Squad stalwarts out to revive their reputations by piggybacking on the fortunes of an elderly actor seeking a comeback of his own. At last, the book breathes: not only do we get the heady backstairs view of celebrity that was part of Goon Squad’s allure, but – more vitally – we relax into a rare moment of real-time interaction between characters otherwise mired in private recapitulation.Maybe the book’s biggest problem (and its point, if you’re generous) is that Silicon Valley will never be rock’n’roll. Either way, conundrums of digital-era privacy and authenticity have been better addressed in novels such as The Circle and Klara and the Sun. As for the question of whether you can read The Candy House without first reading A Visit from the Goon Squad, well... if you haven’t, you’ll probably be left baffled, but perhaps a good deal less disappointed than readers who have.

4/18/2022,"When she worked in banking, Irini Tzortzoglou’s idea of cooking was to pick up a ready meal from Marks & Spencer at Waterloo station on her way home, and put it in the oven. But now, since winning the BBC cooking competition MasterChef in 2019 at the age of 60, with menus inspired by her Greek heritage, food has become her life and new career. She had not been overly interested in cooking, she says with a laugh, though as a child, food was an important part of her life. Tzortzoglou, 64, was born in Crete, where her grandparents’ house was always open – her grandfather was a priest – and her grandmother would often be cooking for dozens of people. Tzortzoglou would help out: “I loved the smells, I loved the processes.” After her parents moved the family to Athens when she was about eight, she didn’t really cook again, until she got married and moved to London. “I thought: ‘I better be a good housewife and feed my husband.’ I bought recipe books, and started cooking three-course meals every day because I was bored.” But she stopped cooking when her husband complained he was putting on too much weight and she started her career – she worked in finance for 30 years, eventually becoming an executive at Piraeus Bank, one of Greece’s biggest financial services companies. “As my career progressed, I found that I had less and less time for cooking,” she says. In 2000, she married her second husband, John, who was often away on business. Then, she says, “I really didn’t cook. I want to cook for other people, I don’t particularly enjoy feeding myself.” She decided to enter MasterChef “out of boredom” after retiring. “It was out of not feeling challenged and driving John crazy, that one day he said: ‘Why don’t you try, because you always love watching it.’” Tzortzoglou was a reasonably good cook, who loved entertaining and could put together a decent dinner party menu, but competing on the show demanded a whole new skill level. “I didn’t want to embarrass myself by leaving in round one, so I trained myself for a year,” she says. She put in time, effort and money (including buying gadgets and overhauling her kitchen at home in Cumbria). “I went to Athens, I ate at Michelin-star restaurants,” she says. “I wanted to see what was happening with Greek food today. I watched a little bit of Greek MasterChef to see what the young chefs were doing. And then I started practising.” She also started physical training because she could see how tough it was to run around the kitchen while filming, or stand for hours. “What worried me was that I was going to have a heart attack in the studio,” she says with a laugh. “I’d had an office job all my life.” She started running, joined a gym, and took hill walks around her home. She treated it, she says, “like my life’s work.” Since her win, Tzortzoglou has become immersed in Greek food, and has written a cookery book, Under the Olive Tree. When we speak, she has spent the previous couple of weeks on a residency at a London restaurant, catered for two dinners, devised and cooked the menu for an awards lunch, and launched a Greek meal for a recipe box company. “I don’t have free time, but I love it,” she says. “I feel like a child let loose in a sweetshop.” She has also become a public speaker, determined to inspire others in later life to start again. “Seeing how alive I feel and how much energy I have, the alternative is unthinkable – to think that, at 60, you go, ‘Oh, now I sit in a corner and read books, and one day I die.’” Tzortzoglou found that being on the programme not only gave her a new career, but changed how she felt about herself, after a lifetime of low self-esteem. “I always felt a fraud in banking,” she says. “I had a father who was incredibly demanding, for whom nothing was ever quite good enough; there was always room for improvement. I thought I had dealt with all that, but clearly I hadn’t because MasterChef showed me that I still did not believe enough in myself.” She couldn’t understand why she was progressing through the rounds, and finally won – with a starter of red mullet, followed by lamb chops, and a fig and hazelnut baklava – because she was so critical of herself. “I would say to [co-host and chef] John Torode, ‘What’s wrong with your taste buds? This is rubbish.’ He would say: ‘Stop it, this is my job.’” She is emotional when she remembers how it felt to win. “To actually be able to say, OK, I’m good enough.” The other weekend, she did a catering job, cooking for 20. When she walked into the dining room, she received a huge round of applause. “A few years ago, I would be like, ‘No, no, it wasn’t good enough.’ Now I’m thinking, actually, that was a bloody good dinner.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I won MasterChef – and finally learned to believe in myself’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/18/a-new-start-after-60-masterchef-believe-in-myself-irini-tzortzoglou-chef-speaker
4/18/2022,"AFL’s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, will receive many tributes for his eight-year legacy of running the premier sporting code in the nation and guiding it though Covid to deliver joy to millions, despite terrible lockdowns. That is rightly so – but there is a huge shadow over his legacy. McLachlan took over as chief executive from Andrew Demetriou, who immediately joined the Crown Resorts board and helped strike a deal with his protege around sports betting, as the newly created Crownbet became the major gambling sponsor of the AFL. Demetriou eventually had to – along with most of the directors – resign from the Crown Resorts board after a royal commission-style inquiry in NSW. But Demetriou’s legacy lived on, as his successor twice renewed the $10m-a-year “official AFL gambling partner” deal, while Crownbet became Beteasy, which was then taken over by Sportsbet. As a result, we’ve now got the Sportsbet Brownlow medal and a Sportsbet grand final, as a generation of children increasingly think that gambling is inextricably linked with our great Aussie game. Under McLachlan’s leadership, the AFL pocketed close to $100m of direct gambling sponsorship revenue and signed television rights deals, which led to a tsunami of advertisements from foreign-owned betting agencies across television, radio, digital and at all grounds where AFL matches are played – with the noble exception of Geelong. The original Sportsbet, pioneered by rich lister Matt Tripp, was estimated to be worth just $250,000 in 2005. But after a successful high court challenge that broke advertising restrictions and the state Tab monopolies, Tripp and a gaggle of global competitors got cheap gambling licenses out of the Northern Territory government and signed deal after deal. Sportsbet is now owned by Dublin-based Flutter Entertainment, the world’s biggest online gambling company, with a market capitalisation of $29.5bn. In its latest results, Flutter gloated about having 50% of Australia’s online gambling market, with 1.1 million regular monthly gamblers who collectively lost $2.3bn to Sportsbet alone in 2021. They described this as “excellent performance”. The same, sadly, is true of the other major sporting codes where Sportsbet is also the “official gambling partner” (the NRL), while the British-owned Bet 365 has Cricket Australia locked up. This is the first generation of parents who have had children grow up watching sport while being bombarded with constant gambling advertisements. A generation ago (except for horse and greyhound racing) this was unthinkable. We need to remember that gambling is an adult product like alcohol, tobacco and legalised brothels. We do not let them get in children’s faces even though all are legal. Gambling sponsorship and advertising in family friendly television viewing hours is the exception, and is now everywhere. We have surrendered to a dangerous and addictive adult product that has legitimised itself by seizing the commanding sporting heights. This has changed their perception of sport and introduced the language of betting odds into many sporting conversations our children have. Every AFL Club app that kids have on their phones has the odds come up first when you just want to check the teams or starting time for the game. This particular scourge is because the AFL handed the keys to its digital data empire to the highest gambling bidder. The federal government is certainly not blameless, as Australians continuously win the world record for per capita gambling losses, which will hit $25bn this year alone. The prime minister and his minister for communications, Paul Fletcher, refuse to heed our call to ban sports betting sponsorship and advertisements. Spain and Italy has recently banned gambling sponsorship of all sporting teams, particularly soccer. But in Canberra they are timid regulators, having banned in-play betting but little else. Instead, family viewing shows from MasterChef to The Block and even the 6pm news are plastered with betting advertisements. Remember that we removed the Benson and Hedges Cricket Cup sponsorship, although tobacco is still legal, and we removed the Foster’s AFL Grand Final as inappropriate for family enjoyment of the game. But our politicians have literally succumbed to betting agencies, sitting idly by while pocketing their donations, as these increasingly multinational companies demonstrate state capture of regulators. The AFL and other codes have sold us an “inevitability story”: that but for the sports betting sponsorships, we could not enjoy top-tier professional sport. But there is nothing inevitable about having gambling so entwined with sport.
