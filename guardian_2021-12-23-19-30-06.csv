12/23/2021,"Moms and dads stormed into the Spotsylvania County town hall, in Virginia, in early November, hell-bent on purging all “objectionable” books from in the scholastic jurisdiction. Novels containing any commentary about race, sexuality and sexual content was put under the microscope, as a fresh reactionary panic takes aim at the stacks in high school libraries. “Results for gay, 172. Results for heterosexual, two,” said Christina Burris, one of the attending parents, who used the district’s literature search function to make her point. The board relented, voting 6-0 to enact a liquidation. One of the books targeted by name was 33 Snowfish, an acclaimed 2003 novel concerning a trio of runaway teens and all sorts of sordid, Kids-ish behavior. The concerned parents of northern Virginia believed that heady themes of poverty, addiction and abuse have no place in the sanctums of learning, and therefore, the book needed to go.  When Paul Cymrot heard about the meeting, he tracked down as many copies of 33 Snowfish he could find. He soon discovered, ironically, that book was never really in the school library. 33 Snowfish is barely in print, and Cymrot tells me that it was an ebook version, lingering in some dusty corner of the school library servers, which sparked the initial animus. The moral militancy immediately backfired, because Cymrot knows a good business opportunity when he sees one. He’s owned the Spotsylvania-area Riverby Books for 25 years, and possesses a shrewd nose for the ebbs and flows of the publishing market. One bookselling truth remains eternally undefeated, explains Cymrot. When a censorious zeitgeist swallows up a novel, a lot of people will want to buy it. “It was not easy to find a box full of 33 Snowfish, but we did,” he continues. “We sold all that we bought, and we kept a couple as loaners because we wanted to make sure any students in the community could see what the fuss was about. There will always be some around.” It’s now easier than ever to read 33 Snowfish in Spotsylvania county, subverting the rightwing siege on the supposed woke conspiracy infecting school libraries. New ominous headlines about book bannings trickle in all the time. Just this month, Texas state representative Matt Krause pushed for the ousting of 850 books, including classics by Alan Moore and Margaret Atwood, from the public curriculum. A few days earlier, Parents in Kansas City barnstormed school conventions because they fear that their children might start internalizing the wisdom of Alison Bechdel or Angie Thomas. Two members of the board at the Spotsylvania meeting floated the idea of literally burning the offending titles, which would be an assault on both our precious norms and our precious subtext. As always, the impetus of the mania is simple, stupid and cynical. The Republican party has made a concerted effort to bring outré philosophic principles like critical race theory to the heart of our politics, which is why the Virginia governor-elect, Glenn Youngkin, spent much of his time on the campaign trail griping about Toni Morrison’s Beloved. Parents took the bait, and overnight high school librarians – those brazen extremists pushing their anti-American agendas by cataloging Pulitzer winners from 1987 – were put in the crosshairs. These books are rarely inflammatory or obscene; instead, they simply contain narratives about race, gender and inequality that chafe against prescribed American ideology. That’s more than enough for an emboldened conservative movement. But there is no evidence that the wave of book bans are actually accomplishing their intended ambition. If anything they’ve achieved the opposite effect. Sales of Beloved increased after Youngkin transformed Morrison into a partisan figure, and Jerry Craft, an author and artist who found himself on the Krause list for his 2019 graphic novel New Kid, has spoken at length about how legislative suppression is an unlikely boon for his career. “What has happened is so many places have sold so many copies because now people want to see what all the hubbub is,” he said, in an interview with the Houston Chronicle. “They’re almost disappointed because there’s no big thing that they were looking for.” In 2021, with countless different merchants all manacled together by an intercontinental supply chain, proscribing a novel is almost entirely ceremonial – more of a whinging fit than a genuine political project. The Nazis burned thousands of books after seizing Berlin in 1933. Today, if a constable comes looking to repossess your literature, a replacement copy can be delivered to your mailbox the next morning. In fact, the booksellers I spoke to for this story all seemed eager to take on the government’s injunction as a spiritual challenge – almost like a test of their moral fortitude. Mark Haber, operations manager at Houston’s Brazos Bookstore, tells me his staff put up a display featuring a selection of the books evaporating from Texas school libraries. (Beloved and Michelle Zauner’s Crying in H-Mart are currently performing very well.) “We had a drive where people could buy a banned book as a donation for a free library somewhere in the city,” says Haber. “The bannings feel so organized. They aren’t targeting a specific book, they’re targeting ‘books’ in general.” Brazos, of course, is part of Houston’s liberal enclave. There is a self-selection bias in his sales figures and customer clientele, which Haber happily admits. “It’s definitely a political stance,” he says. “We have customers who’ve maybe already read the book, and just want to buy it again.” In fact, Cymrot tells me that he thinks that the book-ban sales bump is truly a bipartisan phenomenon. He notices a surge regardless of what party is currently relitigating the library. Earlier this year, when six of Dr. Seuss’ books left circulation due to some offensive caricatures in the pages, Riveryby thrived once again. “These paperbacks in our basement suddenly became collectibles,” he says. At the very least, hopefully the censorship campaigns encourage kids to read more. I like the idea of enterprising teens wielding the Krause agenda like a summer reading list, checking off every title, one by one, until they’ve firmly opened their third eye. One of the most heartening stories that surfaced from the hysteria occurred in York county, Pennsylvania, where local ordinances forbade teachers from using a swath of texts in their lesson plans last November. (The taxonomy was bizarre. Biographies of Aretha Franklin, Malala Yousfanzi and Eleanor Roosevelt were put on ice.) High schoolers around the community roused to action – staging campus protests, canvassing the local papers and eventually winning a reversal of the policy in September. Today, the confluence of students and teachers who overturned the ban are known as the Panthers Anti-Racist Union, named after the mascot of Central York high school. The group aims to continue their social justice advocacy into the future, which could soon result in much bolder action than the mealy proclivities of the local school board. “We’ve always said this organization is about creating a safe space for everyone to talk about who they are, and what their struggles are. Not just in our school community, but in their lives,” says Edha Gupta, a senior at Central York high school and a member of the Panthers Anti-Racist Union. “Any healthy way for people to genuinely express how they’re feeling about these matters. We want a place for students to feel like they have the authority to speak up about what they’re passionate about.” “I went through the list of the banned books and I thought they sounded great. My mom had a ton of them, I got others from random people,” says Olivia Pituch, another member of the union. “It’s funny, the ban made me more curious to see what they were about.”",News/Education,US conservative parents push for book bans – and unintentionally make reading cool again,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/23/us-book-bans-conservative-parents-reading
12/23/2021,"Ratnaboli Ray regards one of the lowest points of her life as a breakthrough. After years in an arranged marriage in which she felt stifled and trapped, her mental health took a catastrophic turn in 1997, when she was in her mid-30s. “I was feeling very caged, I was not able to express myself,” she says, from her home in West Bengal, India. She describes the psychological symptoms as like a pressure cooker bursting. “I used to get angry, have weeping spells. I was neglectful of my young son.”  Ray, a trained psychologist, was working in a private mental health facility run by an NGO in West Bengal at the time, so she recognised what was happening to her. She was diagnosed with a severe mood disorder, underwent therapy and was prescribed medication, which she still uses. After about a year and a half of treatment, her condition was more stable. Although the deterioration of Ray’s mental health meant she had to resign from her job, it also empowered her and set her on a different path. “I acknowledged my fragility and vulnerability, and it gave me a power to speak to the authorities, whether that was my in-laws or the government. I learned to speak up, and that is why it was a breakthrough and not a breakdown.” In her previous role, she had seen some of what patients experienced in government-run mental health facilities, where care was much worse than the kind she received in a private facility, and decided she wanted to do something about it. “I thought we had to do something that was different from setting up isolated institutions, which were like islands,” she says. “I had this idea of entering a public mental health hospital and bringing systemic change.” Conditions in public mental health hospitals at the time were “terrible”, she remembers. “Women were overdrugged, nobody could go home. The wards were dingy. The conditions were abysmal. Care was very poor,” she says. “The nursing staff were reminiscent of those in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. There were a lot of human rights violations.” Patients went on hunger strike because the food was so bad, it was normal for them to be completely naked and have lice, indicative of the filthy conditions. Shackling patients to restrain them was commonplace, as were seclusion cells where patients were locked up in solitary isolation when they were thought to be dangerous. Ray believes conditions were worse for women than for men. Little research has been done on the prevalence of mental health problems or facilities in West Bengal, but in 2016 the National Mental Health Survey of India said 13% of the state’s population were living with conditions such as anxiety, stress and schizophrenia, while research from 2019 found women in state psychiatric facilities are more likely than men to stay there for many years. Lancet research, spanning 1990 to 2017, showed a slightly higher rate of depressive disorders and suicide among women than men across India. It concluded this “could be related to gender discrimination, violence, sexual abuse, antenatal and postnatal stress, and adverse socio-cultural norms”. Ray focused on helping female patients because she was aware of the impact of societal issues and violence against women in India. “As a feminist and human rights activist, suicide is not just a mental health issue. It’s an intersectional issue and has huge social determinants,” she says. Ray approached the state’s human rights commission, asking to address overcrowding in hospitals. She was given permission to work in Kolkata Pavlov hospital, the largest government mental health hospital in West Bengal, in 2000. She would arrive every morning at 8am, visit a female ward and collect six women. They would sit on mats outside, sing, chat, create art or play, and Ray would listen to their stories. One patient had been there for three years after leaving her family for her lover, who then abandoned her. She told Ray she wanted to return to her children. Ray helped her, along with more than 20 other women, to go home in her first year of working there. “It was a huge milestone for the government,” she says. At first, her presence at the hospital was seen as a threat by some. One day, early in her work, Ray says four officers working at the hospital locked her up to try to intimidate her. It wasn’t until six hours later that people heard her cries for help and let her out. However, Ray says that the climate in the hospital has changed and they now have a “mutually respectful partnership”. She still faces threats for her work from elsewhere and often receives anonymous letters filled with sexual insults. In 2019, she was charged with sedition along with other prominent voices in India for writing a letter to the prime minister voicing concerns about mob lynching. Charges were later dropped. Ray has gone on to work in all the hospitals in West Bengal and, in 2000, founded Anjali, which, as part of its work to modernise treatments and end stigma surrounding mental health, provides skills training to patients to help reintegrate them back into society. This included setting up a launderette in Kolkata Pavlov hospital, which patients are paid to run. There is also a bakery and small canteen on the hospital premises, as well as a block printing studio. There are plans to expand the project to other hospitals. Ray was born in 1961 into a middle-class and educated family with liberal values. “I grew up listening to the Beatles. I was inspired by the civil rights movement. I was into rock’n’roll. I used to go hiking,” she remembers. She studied for a masters in clinical psychology and entered into an arranged marriage when she was in her early 20s. She and her husband had a son, before the pair separated and then got divorced. She says: “[In West Bengal,] you don’t get married to a person, you marry the entire family. There was a huge amount of pressure. Finally, I realised after getting married that it was a patriarchal setup.” Throughout her career, Ray, now 60, has worked to shed light on some of the human rights abuses in hospitals. She has successfully lobbied for change in the law, including challenging the use of solitary confinement and electroshock therapy without consent in West Bengal. In 20 years, she has seen conditions improve and that there are now more organisations that advocate for the rights of mental health patients. But for Ray, there’s still much to do. In a country with a population of more than a billion people, continuing stigma and a paucity of resources dedicated to mental health, change is hard. Ray acknowledges: “I won’t be able to see complete change in my lifetime, because it’s a continuous process.”  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

12/23/2021,"Marcia Griffith’s debut solo album – released between her UK hits as one half of Bob and Marcia and her membership of Bob Marley’s backing vocalists the I-Threes – is the kind of record you can’t believe you haven’t already heard, or at least heard of: surely people should have been banging on for years about something this good? Griffith’s tough-but-tender vocals are incredible, and while the sound seems to pitch her as something more than a straightforward reggae artist, it was made the year after Bob Marley’s breakthrough album, Catch a Fire, had proved Jamaican artists could potentially reach a wide international audience.  Whatever the thinking behind it, the results are just exquisite: the versions of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and Just Don’t Want to Be Lonely – a then-recent hit for the Main Ingredient – sound like proto-lovers rock; Everything I Own takes the song at a Northern Soul-like clip, there’s a vaguely psychedelic funk aura about Children at Play and the astounding opening cover of Al Green’s Here I Am (Come And Take Me). The version you want is released by the exemplary reissue label Be With, which adds a whole additional album of extra tracks, including an awesome cover of the Beatles’ Don’t Let Me. AP More diamonds from cratedigging’s current coalface, Japan. Amid releases from Light in the Attic and 180g surveying the country’s pop, folk and ambient sounds comes this compilation on Dutch label Music From Memory, in which Osaka-based collectors Eiji Taniguchi and Norio Sato burrow into a beautiful corner of their country’s musical history. A UK comparison might be the wistful pop of Talk Talk or the Blue Nile, blended with the “fourth world” ambience of Jon Hassell, but of course there’s a very particular non-western mood here: whether it’s trip-hop, new age, nu-disco or playful jazz-pop, each transporting track evokes a utopian, pastel-shadowed mirror-world outside linear time. Highlights include Yosui Inoue’s Pi Po Pa, the most delicate ska song imaginable, and the stirringly romantic violin melodies of Keisuke Kikuchi’s Retro Electric. Buying a physical version is essential, as not all the tracks are licensed for streaming/download. BBT The pleasure of being a jazz neophyte means I get to enjoy lightning bolt moments with the genre that bring back the mind-expanding feeling of first hearing Bowie, Bush or Joy Division as a teenager. Mingus! Aki Takase! Cecil Taylor! Evidently, I’m not plotting a linear, or by any means logical, path through its history, but going purely by ear (and sometimes the generous guidance of Guardian jazz critic John Fordham). When I first heard San Lorenzo, the opening track from the debut album by the Pat Metheny Group, it was as if Lee Krasner had started flinging paint around my kitchen in the drabbest days of the pandemic. It was splashy, jubilant and alive in a way I hadn’t felt in months, and made space for contemplation amid its vivid trills. The whole album expands on those themes, braving moments of almost cheesy optimism (fit to soundtrack my favourite kind of big-city 80s film), and balancing them with quieter, more skittish grooves. One day I might have the language to approach this sophisticated record on its own terms; for now, I’m content to revel in its vibrancy. LS I only really knew the Marvelettes though Bananarama’s cover of Really Sayin’ Something but a mention by Elvis Costello led me to their deeper catalogue. It’s a treasure trove of songs that have become more associated with later artists, such as Please Mr Postman (the Carpenters), The Hunter Gets Captured By the Game (Grace Jones) and When You’re Young and in Love (the Flying Pickets). With Motown’s best songwriting and production teams at their disposal, the Inkster, Michigan vocal group were obviously spoilt for songs but, with two lead singers, Wanda Young and Gladys Horton, their delivery is quite different to glossier peers such as the Supremes or the Ronettes. High school friends who formed a group initially called the Casinyets (as in “We can’t sing yet”), their 1960s career faced setbacks from a breakdown to serious illness (key member Georgeanna Tillman died aged just 35), but their voices have a youthful, gleeful, hopeful quality that I’ve found really touching. DS For someone who considers themselves a rap sample connoisseur, I’m embarrassed to admit I only discovered Lonnie Liston Smith’s wider catalogue earlier this year. I knew the famed jazz keyboardist as the architect of thousands of samples in hip-hop, such as the mournful keys from A Garden of Peace that appear on Jay-Z’s Dead Presidents. I had been listening to the latter track and searched the original out of bored curiosity. The discovery felt like a door opening in my mind. Smith’s trademark jazz-funk fusion is so expansive it borders on psychedelic, and the song titles themselves suggest an urge to score the fantastical. The glimmering synths of Shadows and rolling piano runs of Inner Beauty engulf the mind, also thanks to the musician’s penchant for gorgeous, chimerical paintings as cover art. Most beautiful of all is his commitment to bringing serenity to his listener through what is not there: largely sans human vocals, his compositions are a place where the instruments themselves find a way to sing. CO Everyone remembers the controversy surrounding gravel-voiced hitmaker Bob Dylan “going electric” in 1965, but perhaps we’ve all been focused on the wrong musical volte-face. In 2002, with seven UK Top 10s under their Burton Menswear belts, Ben, Paul, Christian and Mark, AKA boyband A1, took a huge creative risk, ditching Same Old Brand New You’s plastic drum machines in favour of lilting full-band instrumentation. Alongside producer Mike Hedges (the Cure, Travis), they created Make It Good, a Radio 2-focused opus that preceded Take That’s soft-rock relaunch by four years. At the start of lockdown 2020, I became fully obsessed with the album’s keening lead single, Caught in the Middle. All acoustic ripples, gently percolating drama and an immaculate, heaven-sent chorus melody, it tickled my brain for months. By the start of 2021 I’d moved on to the whole album. Turns out the featherlight title track is just as moreish, while Learn to Fly, One Last Song and Here Comes the Rain are laser-focused boyband ballads dressed up in Coldplay’s Yellow-era baggy cords. Sure, the album flopped, and one member quit, but what is life without risk? MC The YouTube algorithm gifted me this on a crisp, dwindling October afternoon. Ever since, the Japanese artist’s 1974 psych-y folk/pop/rock album has acted as a cosy comfort, lightening my seasonal depression. Given much pop in 2021 reverted to pared-down songwriterly richness, this feels fresh and timely. Alongside the warm, intermittent flourishes from vocalists Alex Easley and Vicki Sue Robinson, and the vast melody of Shimoda’s acoustic guitar and weaving piano, his own singing flies above it all with quiet intensity. As the title suggests, these songs speak to yearning and tenderness – and though much of it is in a language I don’t understand, you can still hear the feeling pouring straight from Shimoda’s chest – sweet and unbound, fierce in its intimacy. TJ Before this year, the only thing I knew about Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine was that they had a song called The Only Living Boy in New Cross, a pun on the Simon and Garfunkel classic that I found pleasingly bathetic, in a quintessentially British sort of way. Then, in January, I moved to New Cross and soon the title began circling my brain on a near-daily basis. For months I walked round vaguely imagining what the song sounded like, but constantly forgetting to actually listen to the thing. When I finally did, it did not disappoint. Melodically rapturous, ridiculously sentimental indie-punk with eye-wateringly try-hard lyrics: the kind of music I can’t help but love. It also sounded incredibly dated, in the best possible way: the band’s early 90s sartorial choices – fisherman beanie, garish knitwear – may have returned to SE14, but guitar music this exuberant, earnest and gloriously embarrassing rarely gets a look-in these days. RA Maybe it’s because of their critical re-evaluation in recent years, their arrival at meme status thereafter, or simply down to inevitability, like the passing of time itself: I spent 2021 absorbed by the colourful, fabulist yacht rock sound of Steely Dan. I was a fan before I knew I was, thanks to De La Soul’s genius interpretation of Peg. Though the original remains an irresistibly fun tale detailing the distance between ex-lovers (as does Reelin’ in the Years, from the opposite end), the Dan are at their most lovable when playing the part of commiserating friend. They’re acting in bad faith at times – the insincere coaxing of Rikki Don’t Lose That Number and the self-pitying, assumed camaraderie of Midnite Cruiser, for example. But a friend is a friend, and no better support has been extended, no better advice offered than on Any Major Dude Will Tell You. In another year that feels lost to global despair, spent fighting losing battles and well, feeling like a loser, I’ve taken solace in playing their Rikki, their Felonius, their funky one. TA My 2021 Spotify Wrapped is a brutally honest, hilarious assessment of what I’ve been up to this year: pacifying a child in the car (The Lion King soundtrack, a Spice Girls best-of) and writing a book (Brian Eno’s Thursday Afternoon and other mood-softening ambient epics on endless repeat). But Eliane Radigue’s Trilogie de le Mort – another regular – has provided something more meaningful than a simple playlist to accompany work. Inspired by the six states of consciousness in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it can silence the noise in my head, helping me lose myself entirely in the incredible beauty and simultaneous unease of Radigue’s ARP synthesiser drones. I’d admired other works by her in concert before, but my attention often wandered, craving brighter melodies and rhythms. No longer. On my headphones at night at my laptop, I marvel at how a modern instrument can create such guttural, primordial reverberations. JR  Which historic music gems did you discover this year?

12/23/2021,"It was hard to get through 2021 without hearing about the supply chain. Before the pandemic, the way products from all over the world would get to American consumers seemed to be a part of a smooth-going system. A survey of consumers found that 45% of Americans admitted to never thinking about how their products were made and delivered before the pandemic.  But the last year has seen dozens of ships stuck at ports, warehouses full to the brim with stuff and a shortage of truck drivers, all leading to emptier shelves and out-of-stock messages online. Issues with the supply chain have led to shortages across the country of goods ranging from cars to cream cheese to Christmas trees. Experts believe the pandemic caused a perfect storm of factors that led to cracks in the supply chain that was already vulnerable in the first place. “You have a supply chain that has been built on a premise of being lean and efficient and that works great when things are operating smoothly,” said Keely Croxton, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. “But as soon as there’s a glitch in the supply chain, these lean supply chains become brittle and break.” Companies today largely rely on a supply chain model called “just in time” that was created by Toyota in the 1950s. As its name suggests, the model has companies keep few raw materials on hand and only order them when they need it, all with the goal of getting the end product to consumers just on time. The “just-in-time” model clashed with the reality of consumer demand during the pandemic. Many companies assumed that demand would drop as the spread of Covid-19 caused worldwide shutdowns, including in manufacturing factories. But the pandemic ended up bolstering consumer demand for goods as aid from stimulus bills and savings from spending less on other expenses like travel and eating out encouraged people to shop online. Retail sales during the 2020 holiday season grew 8.3% despite the pandemic as Americans continued to shop. Ultimately, consumers were wanting more goods while companies were simultaneously making less. This phenomenon particularly hurt the manufacturing of computer chips, which led to shortages of cars and some consumer electronics, like video game consoles. Increased demand also saw more goods being shipped from Asia to the US, leading to seemingly indefinite congestion at two major ports in California. At one point, a record high of 100 vessels were waiting off the coast of Los Angeles to dock. Some ships were waiting months to unload their goods. This affected retailers like Victoria’s Secret, which saw half of its inventory for the fall season delayed because it was stuck on ships unable to unload. Part of the congestion clog comes from a lack of space at the ports because they are overwhelmed with large empty shipping containers. Some reports say there are over 115,000 empty containers sitting in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The twin ports have started threatening ocean carriers with fine penalties for leaving empty shipping containers in the ports in an effort to offload empty containers. Costco and Walmart were some of the few major companies that resorted to renting shipping containers to ensure goods get to stores in time for the holidays. On top of issues at the port, the US has been seeing a shortage of truck drivers. The trucking industry estimates that it is now short 80,000 truck drivers because of pandemic-induced retirements and resignations. In mid-December, the White House announced it would expand paid apprenticeships and recruit military veterans to bolster the industry, though the impacts of the initiative will probably not be seen any time soon. Croxton said supply chain researchers have long studied the weaknesses of today’s supply chain and have advocated for more resilient structures that can handle disruptions. For example, companies could pay attention to weather events and news and track inventory levels throughout the supply chain. Shortening the supply chain, like relying on domestic manufacturing, would also mean more oversight. “The number of disruptions that we’ve had in our supply chains has been increasing over the last decade,” Croxton said, citing extreme weather events and economic and political uncertainty. “This isn’t new to companies that the supply chains get disrupted.”",News/Business,"Pandemic caused perfect storm for supply chain crisis, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/pandemic-vulnerabilities-supply-chain-model
12/23/2021,"Previously a fashioner of star vehicles for Salman Khan, director Kabir Khan anchors this nimble and big-hearted biopic of the India cricket team’s improbable 1983 World Cup triumph in a smiling performance from new-generation hunk Ranveer Singh as captain Kapil Dev. Dev’s wobbly English, which makes him a laughing stock among his teammates, seems to stand for the group’s inferiority complex. But inside this awkwardness is an obduracy and capacity for improvisation that becomes the guiding light of their victory run. As he blurts out on the team bus: “Taste the success once, tongue want more!”  India, who had only won a single World Cup match before the tournament, were deeply unfancied outsiders. So Khan frames the arrival in England of Dev, and other now legendary cricketers such as Sunil Gavaskar (played by Tahir Raj Bhasin) and Roger Binny (Nishant Dahiya), in jauntily comic underdog vein. They exceed import regulations by bringing in pickles to spice up British grub and ogle sex workers’ calling cards; they’re beaten in the warm-ups by a county side and condescended to by officials, journalists and commentators. What separates 83 from the likes of The Full Monty, though, is a realpolitik edge; in finding their groove and turning over a terrifying West Indies side whose fast-bowling style the film suggests was their riposte to their one-time British masters, the Indians were also mustering an anti-colonial poke in the eye. There are a lot of matches and players to cover, but Khan skates energetically through it all, sketching tactical shifts in creaseside exchanges between batsmen and deploying economic character riffs (Viv Richards gets a funky fanfare every time he struts on). He adroitly balances entertainment and politics, mostly ducking the kind of hoarse nationalism currently creeping into Indian and Chinese blockbusters and lobbing in his anti-colonial spinners at unexpected moments. One scene in which Indira Gandhi muses on the World Cup’s potential to defuse tensions on the domestic front hints at sport’s role as part of the bread-and-circuses setup for distracting the masses. 83 doesn’t delve any further than that into what degree sporting victory ever translates to social and political progress. But it is an endearing sports film with just enough awareness of where it stands, now that Britain’s imperial legacy is being questioned more than ever, on a larger field.  83 is released in cinemas on 24 December.",Arts/Film,83 review – cricket crowdpleaser puts a new spin on the underdog movie,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/23/83-review-cricket
12/23/2021,"There are two ways of looking at the fact that I was given The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett one Christmas when I was about 11. The first: my parents thought that because I was reading a lot of fantasy novels, I was going to love this one.  I’d devoured the Lord of the Rings (more than once), I’d loved Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea trilogy, I’d munched through Redwall by Brian Jacques. I needed more and I was bound to love a book whose cover featured a chest sprouting pink human feet, a wizard and a goblin with an axe. The second: my parents thought that because I was reading a lot of fantasy novels, I needed an intervention. My eagerness for stories about swords and magic had recently led me to The Belgariad by David Eddings. These were the earnest adventures of Garion, Mister Wolf, Durnik, Torak and another bazillion characters with daft names. They were books with the potential to corrode my psyche. One passage ended with the statement “thou art truly approaching manhood, young Garion” and left me determined to avoid puberty until I was at least 21 and more able to cope with the attendant embarrassment. It was also painfully clear that most of the female characters in the books seemed to want nothing more than to be 1950s housewives – only without the labour-saving gadgets. This kind of fantasy was ripe for the kind of corrective that Pratchett promised. Talking of correctives, I should probably attend to my own premise at this point. I can see a third possibility here: I just got lucky. Maybe it’s wrong to analyse the provenance of a beloved present. Quite often the real reason you get a gift is “just because”. But never mind that. Because it’s also fun to overthink why you were given something – especially if that something has gone on to have a profound impact on your life. Which The Colour of Magic has. I was immediately swept up in the misadventures of Rincewind, the inept wizard careening around the Discworld, a flat planet floating through space on the back of four elephants, who were in turn on the back of a giant turtle called Great A’Tuin. I loved such absurd stretches of the imagination. And I loved the jokes. And the jokes about the jokes. And the footnotes attached to the jokes, which were in turn jokes. Pratchett was gleefully, unashamedly and quite gloriously silly. But he also gave me a whole new way of thinking both about fantasy and reality. The truth is that neither of the two apparently contradictory ideas I considered above actually mattered when it came to reading this first Discworld novel. The beauty of The Colour of Magic is that while it reveals and mocks plenty of the absurdities of fantasy, it never entirely undermines them. Pratchett said he wrote the book in protest against “too many dark lords, too much lack of thought” – but that he also loved the genre. He understood the appeal of escaping into strange new worlds, and he also knew that doing so had the potential to tell us something new about our own circumstances and morality. The Colour of Magic may not have had the complexity and profundity of his later works, but it still had fascinating things to say about life and death. (Not to mention a character called Death who spoke IN CAPITAL LETTERS and “in tones as deep and heavy as the banging of doors, far underground”.) It was wonderful heady stuff and it changed me. Most obviously, I was never able to take David Eddings entirely seriously again. Of course, I still read him. I still enjoyed him, in fact. But I was also able to laugh whenever anyone gave their sword a daft name or broke into faux medieval English. Meanwhile, and conversely, Pratchett also helped me to take the genre of fantasy more seriously. It made me better appreciate the books that really worked – and also helped me to start to have an idea about how and why they did succeed. Now that I myself have become a publisher of fantasy fiction I like to hope that Pratchett’s unique brand of wisdom has guided me in my work. And even if it hasn’t, I still have plenty to thank him for. Because perhaps the greatest benefit I got from reading The Colour of Magic was that it led me on to all the other Terry Pratchett novels and the endless pleasure and enlightenment they’ve given me over the years. It was a good present. I’m grateful.",Arts/Books,The book I got for Christmas: ‘I was swept up in the misadventures of Rincewind’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/23/the-book-i-got-for-christmas-i-was-swept-up-in-the-misadventures-of-rincewind
12/23/2021,"On her fourth day of Covid symptoms, Ruth woke up in the worst pain of her life. It felt like her joints were filled with broken glass; she couldn’t walk, couldn’t move. “It was worse than childbirth,” she said. When friends texted to check on her, she couldn’t hold the phone or move her fingers to write back. Her doctor called in medication, and it took Ruth 40 minutes to shuffle to the pharmacy half a block away.  Ruth – who did not want her full name used – is certain that if she weren’t vaccinated and boosted, she would be in the intensive care unit or worse right now. But while she’s recovering from this “mild” case, she’s unable to work even as cases surge in her region. Ruth is an emergency nurse in Washington DC. Her case of breakthrough Covid shows what may happen when the more contagious variant hits health workers all over the country – and the pressures Omicron will put on a US health system already groaning under the weight of the pandemic. In this wave, it’s not a shortage of beds but a shortage of qualified workers to care for people in those beds that is raising alarm bells. “What do you do when you have a tidal wave coming at you in a little paddle boat?” Ruth asked. “There’s going to be a huge uptick. Our entire waiting room is going to be all Covid-positive.” In Washington DC the infection curve looks like a straight line up. On Saturday, the city nearly tripled its previous record-high number of cases. At least two of Ruth’s colleagues were already out sick with Covid. In a matter of weeks, Omicron has become the dominant variant in the United States. It accounts for 73% of sequenced cases, six times higher than last week. As the holidays approach, officials and experts warn of an unmanageable crush of patients and potentially catastrophic staffing shortages. “This is a big concern,” said Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “This is a highly contagious variant, and we really think it could cause significant issues with the workforce.” Omicron is spreading like wildfire and slamming into hospitals, and “​​there’s no question that this is going to be on us, really in the next week or so”, Plescia said. Others agreed. “There’s no question” that Omicron outbreaks among healthcare workers are “significantly diminishing the workforce”, said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “It has profound implications for our ability to not just take care of people with Covid but [also] the other diseases that are out there.” The American Nurses Association is urging US officials to declare the nursing shortage a national crisis, and the American College of Emergency Physicians has expressed concerns the shortage will affect patient care. Makers of monoclonal antibodies also delivered crushing news recently: most of them – including the one the US heavily invested in – don’t work well against Omicron. The only one that does is in short supply, and the last available shipment just went out. Without widespread medications to prevent hospitalization and death, health systems may face more stress. Even before Omicron, the situation was growing dire as hospitals grappled with a Thanksgiving surge in cases. Nearly two years into the coronavirus outbreak, nurses, doctors, specialists and other key health workers are exhausted. In April, 55% of front-line health workers reported feeling burned out. They frequently face harassment and frustration at work. “It’s really horrible,” Ruth said. “I got into medicine to take care of people, and people are just angry at me all the time.” The day she was infected, there were 150 people in the waiting room, facing a nine- or 10-hour wait time. Recently, a child came into her hospital with a broken arm. An orthopedic surgeon was ready to operate, but there were no nurses available to assist in the procedure. The child had to wait for 10 hours. Yet Ruth knows she’s not ready to go back yet; it still hurts to move, and her thinking is foggy, even if she’s not contagious anymore. “I cannot provide appropriate care for my patients,” she said. Just getting up to tidy her apartment made her oxygen drop to 91%. She had Covid before, early in the pandemic, and it wiped her out for a week and a half. She had to wear a cardiac monitor for two weeks because of heart complications. She was eager to get vaccinated, and received her first shot on the first day vaccines were available in the US. Those vaccines cut her illness short and kept her out of the hospital. Omicron is a particular threat because it is effective at overcoming protection against infection among those who have been vaccinated or survived previous cases of Covid – which means even vaccinated health workers may need to isolate after a positive test or take time off to recover from the illness. “Health systems are going to have to plan for that,” Benjamin said – a calculation that is especially fraught during the holiday season. Hospital administrators may need to bring back retired workers, even for a short period of time, and “rethink some of the services that they’re delivering”, Benjamin said. “They’re probably going to have to put off a lot more discretionary procedures. But there are some services that we just can’t continue to put off.” The national guard may also be deployed in areas with overwhelmed health systems. Health workers who become sick need time to recover. But it’s possible the public health guidance will change for those who experience mild or no symptoms. “We’re kind of waiting for some guidance from CDC and others on whether we could bring some further flexibility into some of the current isolation and quarantine and other guidance,” Plescia said. “Perhaps, particularly with healthcare workers because they’re wearing pretty significant PPE, maybe they could return to work in five days rather than 10.” In previous surges, even nurses who tested positive were asked to continue working with Covid patients if they were able. In March 2020, in the face of many unknowns about treating the virus and massive testing delays, we were encouraged to stay home and flatten the curve. But Benjamin doubts that will happen again. “We’ve got to figure out how to flatten the curve a little differently,” Benjamin said. He recommends instituting rules requiring proof of vaccination in public places – essentially making it “more difficult for people not to be vaccinated”. Everyone needs to be vaccinated and boosted, Ruth warned. “It’s not a matter of ‘if’ at this point. It’s a matter of when. And how well do you want to be protected against it?”",News/US news,US hospitals struggle with staffing shortages and Omicron outbreaks,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/us-hospitals-staffing-shortages-omicron-covid
12/23/2021,"Achange is desperately needed. I know it and you know it, but someone in this citizenry – most likely you – isn’t ready to make a vast adjustment to their lifestyle. This is a common fallback position among progressives. I’ve always felt comfortable in this territory and simultaneously aggravated by it. Nowhere is this position more routinely applied than in relation to the climate crisis. The argument goes like this: people across the political spectrum broadly agree on the fundamentals and the urgency of the climate crisis, and yet we probably won’t do what we need to do because we’re just too useless. Society is too fractured for people to make altruistic choices; poverty is too endemic for many to be in a position to make changes; financialisation has subverted democracy, so even if the demos was able to make a good, collective decision, it would be thwarted. Even if, by some miracle, the UK managed to overcome these obstacles to make good on its net-zero pledges, the same problems would play out on a global scale to prevent other nations from doing the same.  But this year I changed my mind about this position. It wasn’t because of Cop26, which left most campaigners disappointed. It was because of what Cop26 couldn’t undo. The first two components of reaching net zero are basically in the hands of the government: cleaning up the energy supply, and becoming more efficient in the energy we use. Throughout the 2010s, we assumed that both the major parties were equally committed to tackling the climate emergency and merely differed on whether the state or the market should pay for it. This seemed like a reasonable assumption – the Conservatives in opposition, after all, were behind the Climate Change Act, an inspiringly strong piece of legislation – except for the fact that it was plainly not true. Conservatives committed to arresting the climate crisis wouldn’t have talked about “green crap”. Nor would they have wasted five years on Brexit, or wanted to leave the EU in the first place. The price of entry to the grownups’ conversation was to pretend that all politicians wanted broadly the same thing, by a different route. This was a peculiarly low point for common sense, and it squandered time, fostering a sense that even when those in power wanted to tackle the climate crisis, still nothing constructive could be achieved. Even as recently as September, when Rachel Reeves described at her party’s conference the state spending a Labour government’s green new deal would entail, it was still normal in climate policy circles for people to describe the parties as equally committed to constructive, large-scale change. But it is no longer necessary to pretend that the Conservative government means well, keeps promises or has any long-term plan for tackling the climate crisis. Removing it from power has become more urgent than ever. Accepting these facts is now, paradoxically, less daunting than the effort of papering over reality. The third plank towards net zero has always been behavioural – are people prepared to stop flying and eating meat, and change to bikes and electric cars? And even if you are personally committed to these things, what about those who don’t care, or can’t afford to make adjustments, and what about young people and their fast fashion, and didn’t Greta Thunberg once buy a salad wrapped in plastic? There is a tendency to respond to every climate aspiration with a darting list of the insufficiencies of humankind. Yet the granular work done by the Climate Change Committee shows the lifestyle changes this crisis will ask of us are in fact pretty manageable. The most demanding will probably be the switch to battery-powered cars (60% of vehicles by 2035). Otherwise, the number of miles per driver will need to reduce by 4%; plane kilometres per person by 6%; meat and dairy consumption by 20%. Arguably, this is the time to start new conversations – is net zero, in this time frame, ambitious enough? Can the disproportionate carbon usage of the affluent somehow be reflected in redistributive policy, so everyone has an allocation of plane miles and those who can’t afford to use theirs can sell them instead? Would it make sense to subsidise meat and dairy alternatives in the same way renewables were initially supported? Is it feasible to make a carbon budget, as a nation, that doesn’t take into account the footprint of your imports? (Not really.) What is now unarguable is that all this is within our grasp. Radicals and progressives may maintain the longterm goal of bringing down capitalism and re-evaluating what life is for, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing constructive that we can do in the short term. I’m not sure that I would make a different or more certain prediction of what life will look like in 30 years’ time. But the idea that the changes required are too radical or the people who need to make them too timid, I’ve completely put aside.

12/23/2021,"Judges across the US have been handing down stiff sentences and hard words in recent weeks for extremist supporters of Donald Trump who took part in the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol. Since a federal judge sentenced Jacob Chansley, the US Capitol rioter nicknamed the “QAnon shaman” for his horned headdress, to 41 months in prison last month, more US judges have been delivering strict sentences to defendants charged over their roles in the attacks earlier this year.  Since the riots, federal prosecutors have brought cases against 727 individuals over their involvement in the deadly riots. With hundreds facing criminal charges, Trump has come under growing scrutiny from the House select committee investigating the attacks. The longest sentence so far was handed down to a Florida man who threw a wooden plank and fire extinguisher at police officers during the riots. On 17 December, Judge Tanya Chutkan sentenced Robert Palmer to 63 months of jail time, describing the prison term as “the consequence of those actions”. According to Chutkan, individuals who attempted to “violently overthrow the government” and “stop the peaceful transition of power” would be met with “absolutely certain punishment”. At his hearing, Palmer said he was “really, really ashamed” of his behavior, adding that he was “absolutely devastated” to see the “coldness and calculation” that he used to attack Capitol police. On Tuesday, a Washington state man was sentenced to 46 months of prison time for assaulting police officers with a speaker and a metal baton during the riots. According to court documents, Devlyn Thompson helped move police shields up against a line of rioters in a tunnel, as well as hit police officers. US District Judge Royce Lamberth told Thompson, “The violence that happened that day was such a blatant disregard to the institutions of government … You’re shoving and pushing … and participating in this riot for hours.” Thompson is the second rioter, after Palmer, to be sentenced for the felony of assaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon. More than 140 other rioters face the same charge. Lamberth also sentenced an 81-year-old Army veteran on the same day to three years of probation for illegally breaching the Capitol. Gary Wickersham, one of the oldest of more than 700 rioters facing charges, was sentenced to 90 days of home detention, and will also have to pay a $2,000 fine and $500 for building damage. Defense lawyers argued against any confinement, saying that Wickersham would be unable to visit his grandchildren during his “golden years”. During his hearing, Wickersham asked for “mercy” from Lamberth and explained that he went to the Capitol because “you get bored” sitting at home. “Mr Wickersham, I appreciate what you’ve done here. I think you have led the way for others to recognize that the jig is up,” said Lamberth. The 78-year-old judge also told Wickersham that he is “the first defendant I’ve had that’s older than me in quite some time”. On Tuesday, a Pennsylvania man was also sentenced over his involvement in the riots after his wife accidentally implicated him in a Facebook status. US District Judge James Boasberg sentenced Gary Edwards to one year of probation, 200 hours of community service, as well as a $2,500 fine and $500 in damage fees. In a since deleted Facebook post, Edward’s wife wrote, “Okay ladies, let me tell you what happened as my husband was there inside the Capitol,” adding, “these were people who watched their rights being taken away, their votes stolen from them, their state officials violating the constitution of their country.” According to authorities, Edwards took pictures, helped teargassed protesters and entered an office of an unidentified congressional official. “There really is no more serious and profound action democracy takes than the certifying of a lawful and fair election,” Boasberg said. “And to the extent anyone would interfere with that, particularly with force of violence, they strike at the root of democracy,” he added. That message would seem to go for organizers of the 6 January events as well as participants in the violence. On 22 November, US District Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Capitol rioter Frank Scavo to 60 days in prison, one of the strictest sentences handed down to a misdemeanor defendant and more than four times the prosecutor’s recommendation of two weeks. Scavo, a Trump supporter from Pennsylvania and former school board official, was found guilty of chartering buses to transport approximately 200 residents from Pennsylvania to the Capitol on 6 January.",News/US news,Capitol rioters hit with severe sentences and sharp reprimands from judges,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/capitol-rioters-severe-sentences-reprimands-judges
12/23/2021,"Evidence the Omicron variant is less severe than originally feared does not remove the threat to the NHS this winter, a health service leader has warned. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts, said two studies showing that people infected with Omicron were at less risk of being admitted to hospital than those infected with the Delta variant were good news.  But he stressed that it was still not clear exactly what impact the rapid rise in Omicron cases would have on hospital numbers, and said the NHS remained under “incredible pressure”. Commenting on the studies published on Wednesday, Hopson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We still don’t have conclusive data in terms of what impact Omicron could have in terms of level of hospitalisations. “We have some very early studies, but it’s a bit like trying to predict the result of a football game when you’re only a third of the way through.” A study by Imperial College London using data from England suggests that Omicron patients are 40% less likely to need overnight hospital care than Delta patients. A separate report from Scotland found that the risk of hospitalisation could be 70% lower with Omicron than Delta. Downing Street has not commented directly on the findings, although Boris Johnson is likely to see it as some vindication of his decision to resist calls to announce further restrictions for England after a cabinet meeting on Monday. He has not ruled out measures for the post-Christmas period, but No 10 has indicated nothing will be announced this week. Hopson argued that the new data did not mean the threat to the NHS had been lifted. “The issue is that we’re in incredible pressure right the way across the health and care system,” he said. He said the surge in Covid cases was causing staff shortages, and cited as an example the London ambulance service, which this week has 12% of staff off sick. And he said the NHS was already “busier at this time of year than we’ve ever been before”. He went on: “Our bed occupancy rate is 94.5% compared to last year’s 89%. That’s a huge difference in terms of much more busy. “We’ve got 2,800 people every day who are having to wait more than 30 minutes in the back of an ambulance before we can admit them into hospital because we’re so busy. “Twenty five per cent more people, compared to last year, are having to wait more than 21 days [to be discharged] because our colleagues in social care are under pressure.” Although Omicron may lead to a smaller proportion of infected people needing hospital treatment, the fear remains, because the variant spreads so rapidly, this could nevertheless amount to a number large enough to risk overwhelming hospitals. Prof Andrew Hayward, the director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare and one of the government’s scientific advisers, told the same programme that the new studies were “undeniably good news” but that the country was “definitely not out of the danger zone”. He went on: “I think perhaps we can downgrade this from a hurricane to a very severe storm.” In an article for the Sun, Johnson urged people to take “extra care” before meeting relatives at Christmas and to get a booster jab if they have not done so already.",News/World news,"Omicron still threat to NHS despite ‘good news’, says health chief",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/omicron-still-threat-to-nhs-despite-good-news-says-health-chief
