2/1/2022,"In a skate park under the arches near London Bridge, a couple of game developers called John Ribbins and Simon Bennett are messing around in a half-pipe. (I do not join in – sadly the immense skills that I have built up over 20 years of playing skating games do not in any way translate into real life.) In 2014, their studio Roll7 released a fondly remembered and notoriously tricky skateboarding game called OlliOlli – an experience that prompted them, both lapsed skaters who were obsessive about it in their teens, to get back out on the streets in real life. They had about 10 people working with them back then; now they’re directors of a studio of 80. I’d spent a few days playing Roll7’s latest game, OlliOlli World – an exuberant and characterful tribute to skateboarding, with wild levels full of rails and walls to grind and weird characters such as sentient trees and buff seagulls pottering around in the background. The art, a mix between the kind of mural you might find in a London skate park and the strange but cutesy cartoonish vibe of something like Adventure Time, contrasts with an extremely chill soundtrack that soothes your nerves as you try to pull off awesome chains of tricks.  It’s a hugely appealing game – and where Roll7’s previous OlliOlli skating games from 2014-15 were technical, demanding and just a touch sterile, this one couldn’t be more out there. The levels in OlliOlli were once based on the fairly dismal view from John and Simon’s office in Deptford; this game is set in a colourful skateboarding paradise called Radlandia. It seems to me that something has changed, certainly within the studio but perhaps also with skateboarding culture and what (and whom) it represents. “My experience of getting back into skating in my 30s has been with way different groups of people,” says John. “The women’s scene has blown up. There’s always been queer people in skateboarding but you’d never have seen that representation even seven years ago … Making this game, I was thinking of a lot of the people I skate with now; that it would be cool to make a game they feel represented by.” When you think of skateboarding and video games, you may think of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, the delightfully gratifying PlayStation classics that blew up around the turn of the millennium – around the time that John and Simon were skating in their late teens and 20s. If Tony Hawk’s represented the skate culture at that time (very male, very competitive), OlliOlli World represents it now: more diverse, more colourful and altogether more welcoming. Unsurprisingly, plenty of the people at Roll7 are involved with the sport in real life. The character design lead used to be a pro, and a team member once joined a meeting from A&E having had an unfortunate collision with a car while skating. “OlliOlli 1 and 2 were made from the perspective of skating when we were younger, when everyone thought they might go pro,” he says. “We’ve reached the age now where we all know our career is not gonna be in skating. People aren’t trying to be the best at it, they’re just doing it because they’re having a really good time.” Simon and John wanted people to have a good time making the game, too – something that comes across in the cheerful aesthetic. “There was a mentality change about how to make video games when we started on OlliOlli World,” says John. “All our previous games had been quite stressful; not a lot of people crunched [worked unpaid overtime] on them, but we as directors definitely crunched, we took on a lot, and it was hell. Going into this we thought: let’s try to actually have fun while we’re making it.” Roll7 has been a remote studio since 2016, but a few months into development on this game, the pandemic hit and took remote work to a whole new level; as Simon points out, people weren’t just working from home, they were imprisoned in their houses. Where previously they’d brought everyone working on the game together every two weeks or so to show their progress and hang out, now that wasn’t an option. As they were for many of us during the pandemic, games became an escape; as Simon sees it, Radlandia became a kind of collective fantasy for everyone working on it. “The team have been so positive throughout what has been the most traumatising thing of our generation,” he says. “I feel like OlliOlli World is their reaction to the world being very, very fucked up. They’ve created somewhere else that they’d all like to be. That’s how I look at the game. I mean, I’d rather be in there, it’s a happy place … I want people to miss their train stop because they got lost in a level, locked into that happy state of flow.” OlliOlli World is released for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and PC on 8 February.",Arts/Games,OlliOlli World: the game that captures the vibrant soul of skateboarding culture,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/01/olliolli-world-skateboarding-game
2/1/2022,"Donald Trump directed Rudy Giuliani to ask the Department of Homeland Security if it could seize voting machines in three key states, the New York Times reported.  Citing three anonymous sources, the paper said Giuliani made the call six weeks after Trump’s defeat by Joe Biden but before the January 6 Capitol riot, by supporters trying to stop the certification of electoral college results. A DHS official told Giuliani it did not have the authority to seize the machines, the Times said. The paper also said Trump turned to his personal lawyer after considering a plan to have the Department of Defense seize the machines, and after being told by his attorney general, William Barr, that the Department of Justice would not do so. Executive orders to compel the Pentagon and DHS to act are known to have been drafted. But the newly revealed DHS call, the Times said, “show[s] that Mr Trump was more directly involved than previously known in exploring proposals to use his national security agencies to seize voting machines”. Trump claims the election was subject to massive voter fraud. It was not. His efforts to overturn the election – an outcome he admitted seeking in a statement on Sunday – are being investigated by the House committee on January 6 and by a district attorney in Georgia. The DA, Fani Willis, has requested FBI protection after Trump told supporters they should protest her investigation and others into his business practices in New York. At his Texas rally last Saturday, Trump also promised pardons for January 6 rioters should he be president again. More than 700 rioters have been charged, 11 with seditious conspiracy. The Times said a retired US Army colonel, Phil Waldron, was at the heart of attempts to acquire the authority to seize voting machines in key states, altering the plan to include the DHS when Giuliani said using the military would be too extreme. Waldron, from Texas, is linked to Michael Flynn, a retired general who was among conspiracy theorists pressing Trump to seize voting machines. Trump also pressured officials in key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania to seize voting machines. They resisted. Schemes to send “alternate electors” to Congress from battleground states are the subject of a Department of Justice investigation as well as subpoenas from the January 6 committee. Giulaini is a former mayor of New York and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination but his star has fallen as a result of his work for Trump. Suspended from practicing law in New York and Washington DC, he is the subject of a subpoena from the January 6 committee. In a letter to Giuliani last month, the committee chair, Bennie Thompson, said: “Between mid-November 2020 and 6 January 2021 (and thereafter) you actively promoted claims of election fraud on behalf of former president Trump and sought to convince state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results. “According to witness testimony and public reporting, in December 2020 you urged President Trump to direct the seizure of voting machines around the country after being told that the Department of Homeland Security had no lawful authority to do so.”",News/US news,Trump reportedly directed Giuliani to press officials to seize voting machines,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/01/trump-giuliani-voting-machines-election-report
2/1/2022,"Consumers are starting to run down the savings built up during the pandemic in order to sustain spending patterns threatened by higher inflation, Bank of England figures suggest. With the cost of living rising, Threadneedle Street data showed a marked drop in December in the amounts being deposited in savings accounts and national savings.  The Bank said savings stood at £3.2bn in December, less than a third of the £10.6bn monthly average for the previous 12 months. Consumer credit increased by £800m – of which £400m was on credit cards. Analysts said more people were liable to dip into their savings over the coming months – a period likely to be marked by an increase in the annual inflation rate from December’s 5.4%, higher taxes and higher energy bills. Thomas Pugh, an economist at the consultancy firm RSM UK, said: ‘The latest money and credit figures suggest that consumers are borrowing more and saving less as they try to maintain their lifestyles in the face of surging inflation. “A rise in consumer borrowing over the next year may suggest that consumers are dealing with high inflation and attempting to maintain their lifestyles by borrowing. Indeed, we know that retail sales volumes slumped in December, so it seems unlikely that the £0.8bn increase in consumer credit in December was due to consumers buying more goods.” Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said it was unlikely households were dipping into savings voluntarily given consumer confidence dropped to an 11-month low in January. Excess savings accumulated while spending opportunities were restricted over the past two years would now be run down to compensate for a likely drop in real (inflation-adjusted) incomes of 1.5% this year. Despite the squeeze on living standards, separate Bank of England figures showed demand for mortgages continued to be strong. There were 71,000 approvals for new home loans in December compared with an average of 66,700 a month in the year ending in February 2020, the period before the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the monthly snapshot of manufacturing from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply found output and employment rose at their fastest pace in six months as firms responded to stronger order books and started to get on top of supply bottlenecks. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: “UK manufacturing made a solid start to 2022, showing encouraging resilience on the face of the Omicron wave, with growth of output accelerating as companies reported fewer supply delays. Causes for concern remain, however, as new orders growth slowed, exports barely rose, staff absenteeism remained high and manufacturers’ ongoing caution regarding supply chain disruptions led to the beefing up of safety stocks.”",News/Business,"Inflation fears prompt consumers to run down savings, says Bank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/inflation-fears-prompt-consumers-to-run-down-savings-says-bank
2/1/2022,"What does it take for someone to impersonate a dead teenager to the grieving mother of the deceased? For M Lamar Keene, a prominent Tampa-based medium in the 1960s and 70s, it was a cinch – all it required was a cocktail of cunning, charisma and sheer audacity. In front of the congregation of his spiritualist church, Keene would enter a trance state and appear to speak as the deceased 17-year-old, Jack, and ask Jack’s mother, Lona, to donate thousands of dollars to the church. One day, Lona asked Jack about the secret name he used for her, to prove it was really him, and Keene was stumped – until he attended a gathering at her house and feigned a headache. While pretending to rest in her bedroom, he searched her belongings and found the name scribbled in a family Bible: “Appleonia”. He pulled it off. Keene confessed to being a conman in his 1976 book, The Psychic Mafia. Jack and Lona’s was just one of many audacious cases he revealed in the exposé, which shook the world of spiritualism so much that it led to an attempt on his life. Someone took a shot at him on his lawn but missed, leaving a bullet in the side of his house. In the book, Keene described how mediums shared client information so that they could conduct “hot readings” based on solid facts. He recounted how they would steal jewellery from clients for a few months, only to pretend a dead family member’s spirit had made it reappear (which usually resulted in generous tips). Ultimately, he confirmed that mediums formed a vast network to fraudulently monetise people’s grief. So why did Keene – the so-called Prince of the Spiritualists – choose to blow the whistle on everyone?  Vicky Baker, a journalist with a nose for juicy scandals, knew she had hit the jackpot when she discovered a photograph of Keene dressed in his famous all-white suit and boots. She had Googled “psychic crime rings” to feed a new curiosity about psychic scams while sitting across the road from a medium’s office. Eager to follow up her 2019 podcast series, Fake Heiress (the story of con artist Anna Sorokin, who passed herself off as a wealthy heiress, Anna Delvey), Baker was excited to make Keene its subject. “Now that I think about it, there is a parallel between him and Delvey,” says Baker. “Some people were wowed by her and found her really impressive, others found her quite dull. Some people barely remembered Keene, others he left a massive mark on … an unforgettable showman.” Charisma played a huge part in Keene’s story (“He had this unusual way of speaking that was very theatrical, like he was always putting on a show,” Baker says) and it is illustrated in the podcast by means of dramatisations that verge on cheesy, but fit nicely with the tone of astonishment. Over six episodes, Baker also meets fraud experts, psychologists and sceptics to unpick this absurd world, as well as people who knew Keene – though it was near impossible to get to the roots of his story. Baker knew that Keene’s mother died when he was young. “There was only a certain amount of information I could get my hands on – mostly from the book, and 75 hours of recordings he made for his ghostwriters. Everything else involved a lot of digging,” she says. Not being able to speak to Keene, who died in 1996, further fuelled the intrigue. “The book starts when he is in his 20s, and the guys who interviewed him were more interested in pressing him on other people in the industry, whereas I would have asked more about … well, him.” Baker sent a lot of unanswered emails, before her best lead connected her with Keene’s half-sister, who filled in the wild details about why he had severed ties with his family: “There’s a weird subplot where he convinced an elderly woman that he was her son … it’s a whole new twist that comes up in episode five.” Keene left home to train as a medium with his friend Raoul (a pseudonym). He quickly realised Raoul was an “open-eye” medium, fully aware that he couldn’t contact the dead. After becoming certified as a reverend and opening his own church, Keene attended the popular spiritualism centre Camp Chesterfield, in Indiana. Researching this camp many years later, Baker made an exciting discovery. Baker found out about Mable Riffle, who ran Camp Chesterfield, where desperate guests paid to mingle with mediums and attend seances to try to contact their lost loved ones. Baker describes Riffle, who died in 1961, as the matriarch of mediums: “The fact there was a holiday camp for spiritualists made me so curious to explore more. And her cousin Ethel even set up a rival camp. You could do a whole other podcast on that.” In 1960, another exposé used infrared cameras that revealed the figures who materialised in Riffle’s seances to be humans, entering the room through a side door. For Keene, the camp was an inspiration to go big with his scams, using tips and tricks he picked up there. After many years of success, and a lot of money rolling in, what was it that finally made Keene crack? “It was never quite explained in the book,” says Baker. “But he had a massive run-in with Raoul and felt like he was being pushed out. There was jealousy and accusations on both sides. He described it as the ‘biggest showdown in all of my medium career’. So that’s the argument that caused him to sever ties.” It’s unlikely that Keene revealed the slippery secrets of his trade for moral reasons. Yet Baker was deeply shocked by how his life turned out: after the assassination attempt, he changed his identity and devoted his life to good deeds. Without giving away the revelation brought to light in the final episode of the podcast, Baker says: “I could never have predicted it; I found myself in a completely different world. People who knew him then didn’t even know he was previously a psychic.” Keene’s world might sound utterly absurd, but it still has strong resonance with people’s behaviours and beliefs today. The industry analyst Ibis World reports that the psychic services market in the US is worth $2.2bn, and grew 0.5% a year on average between 2017 and 2022. At a time of collective mass grief, it’s perhaps understandable that spiritualism is having a resurgence. “People wanting to communicate with the dead is timeless,” says Baker. “Today, some psychics refer to themselves as ‘intuitive healers’, which is much more compatible with the wellness industry. Even Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s wellness brand, looks at them. Kim Kardashian promotes psychics. Drew Barrymore has them on her chatshow. Nowadays, it’s a wellness treat – rather than a dark secret in a dodgy alleyway shop.” Fake Psychic is on BBC Sounds from Tuesday 1 February.",Arts/Television & radio,"Scam the bereaved, defraud the dead: the shocking crimes of America’s greatest psychic conman",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/01/m-lamar-keene-fake-psychic-florida
2/1/2022,"I’m fed up with domestic drudgery. Which meals generate the least washing-up?Hannah, London You’re speaking Roberta Hall-McCarron’s language, Hannah: “There’s so much prep and washing up at work, I try to keep things really simple at home,” says the chef/owner of The Little Chartroom in Edinburgh. A broth, she adds, is a good place to start: “That could be chicken or veggie stock, or go down a more Asian route with coconut milk and Thai curry paste.” Hall-McCarron then chucks in whatever vegetables takes her fancy, adding them to the pot according to how long they take to cook, maybe some meat or fish, too, and noodles or rice. “Not only are you getting all the flavour from the broth going into everything you put in the pot, you’ve also got only one pot to wash up afterwards.”  A similar tactic is endorsed by Merlin Labron-Johnson, chef at Osip and The Old Pharmacy in Somerset. “When I want to avoid washing up, my go-to dinner is a simple soup. There’s something very satisfying about the act of throwing lots of ingredients into one pot and letting them simmer away.” He usually punts for leafy greens, such as kale, tearing them in by hand “to avoid chopping”, and adds tinned beans for bulk without contributing to the dirty dishes. Traybakes are also a godsend for keeping the sink from overflowing. To build the best, follow food writer Anna Jones’ six-step plan: pick a “main vegetable” (800g winter roots, say, or chopped butternut squash), then a soft one (for example, 200g spinach leaves or half a jar of roast red peppers, chopped) and put in an oven dish. Add substance (a tin of butter beans or chickpeas, or torn bread), liquid (100ml stock or white wine), herbs and a “flavour boost” (lemon or orange zest, and/or a teaspoon of hot smoked paprika), then bake “until the vegetables are soft and golden”. According to Ferdinand “Budgie” Montoya, chef-owner of Sarap Filipino Bistro in London, every home should have a rice cooker: “You can just put everything in, press ‘cook’ and that’s it.” One regular go-to at Montoya’s house is chopped ginger, garlic, jasmine rice and chicken stock (“or water and stock cubes”), which he mixes before laying “two boneless chicken thighs skin side down on top and a stick of lemongrass that’s been bashed to release the flavour”. Once cooked, he stirs through chopped coriander and spring onion tops. “For a little condiment, finely chop coriander stems, chilli, garlic, ginger and spring onion [the white part], then stir in soy sauce, vinegar– I use Filipino coconut vinegar, but apple cider or white-wine vinegar would work – rapeseed oil, sesame oil and salt.” One-pot pastas, in which the sauce is made from that magic pasta cooking water and whatever ingredients you’ve chucked in, are also only a quick boil away. A personal favourite is Jones’ kale, tomato and lemon spaghetti from A Modern Way to Cook, for which she puts the pasta, halved tomatoes, lemon zest, olive oil, salt and boiling water in a pan and brings to a boil. Turn the spaghetti with tongs every 30 seconds or so for six minutes, then lob in some kale or spinach and cook for another couple of minutes. Top with a sprinkle of parmesan, and these are carbs you’ll want to curl up with – and with minimal washing-up for afters, too.  Got a culinary dilemma?

2/1/2022,"There’s some amazing big-screen spectacle in this weird postmodern emo photo-love drama from Japanese anime director Mamoru Hosoda, whose previous film Mirai elevated him to auteur status. Suzu, voiced by Kaho Nakamura, is a deeply unhappy and lonely teenager at high school, who lives with her dad. Her mum died some years ago, attempting (successfully) to save a child from drowning and Suzu can’t come to terms with the zero-sum pointlessness of this calamity: a total stranger was saved but her mother died. Or not zero in fact: while her loss increased the sum-total of unhappiness, the most popular boy in school – a friend since they were little – is tender and protective towards Suzu. Her life is complicated further when she is persuaded to join a virtual reality meta-universe called U, a glittering unearthly city like a next-level Manhattan or Shibuya. (Presumably entry into this fantasy world needs a VR headset, although oddly this is not made plain.) Participants have their biometrics read and get an enhanced avatar of themselves and Suzu finds that she is now “Belle”, an ethereally beautiful young woman with quirky freckles and a wonderful singing voice. To her astonishment, Suzu finds that Belle is becoming a colossally famous singer – but at the very high point of this meta-success she comes across the Beast, who disrupts one of her concerts: a brutish, aggressive outcast figure loathed by the self-appointed vigilante guardians of U.  You can spend quite a bit of time trying to guess the Beast’s real life identity – disregarding the obvious red-herring options – and my guesses were wrong. The point is perhaps more that Suzu and Belle, like Peter Parker and Spider-Man, have a poignantly dysfunctional relationship with each other: one is an unhappy loser and the other is a superstar. It is an intriguing story, although I have to admit to feeling a bit bemused at the arbitrary way the Beast story is inserted into the already tense and interesting situation of Suzu/Belle and her relationships with people at home and school.  Belle is released on 4 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Belle review – anime that makes for an intriguing big-screen spectacle,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/belle-review-anime-that-makes-for-an-intriguing-big-screen-spectacle
2/1/2022,"If you ever wondered what Jim Jones’s corpse would have looked like if it had spent three weeks getting bleached and bloated by a Guyana river, it floated up to the House of Commons dispatch box yesterday at 3.30pm. Let’s begin with some real talk. The prime minister is under police investigation for multiple breaches of his own Covid laws. At least four gatherings or parties in which Boris Johnson was directly involved are being probed by the Met, including one in his private flat. In total, police are investigating 12 potentially law-breaking Downing Street parties which took place while the British people were ordered – BY HIM – to live under the most draconian restrictions imposed in peacetime. The Global Britain that Johnson promised saw him yesterday bin off a call to the Russian president, who is apparently on the brink of an invasion, so that he could explain that he needs to wait for police officers to decide if he went to an illicit party in his own home. The Conservative MPs somehow able to make their peace with all this increasingly resemble cult members accepting the latest transparent lies and failures of a cult leader.  Suitcases full of Kool-Aid seem to have been wheeled into Boris Johnson’s meeting with Tory MPs last night. Two weeks ago, Birmingham Northfield MP Gary Sambrook was widely reported to be one of the leading lights of a plot to remove Johnson; last night he issued a dispatch from the compound in which he declared the PM to be “the Boris Johnson we love and who has delivered”. Sorry, Gary, but wake up. This ends with a bungling Swat team going through the window and discovering the whole place is wired. As for what Johnson said to his followers last night, he is reported to have compared himself to Othello, who he seems to think was “always seeing the best in people”. Righto. To confirm: the country isn’t just being run by a guy who can’t even understand the plot of Othello, but by a guy who can’t even understand the plot of Othello and is writing a book about Shakespeare. It’s called not giving a fuck, Gary – look it up. That said, good to see the PM getting his excuses in early for shopping Desdemona to the cops for her Abba party. And yet, for someone who normally puts the I am into iambic pentameter, Johnson will still only speak in the first person plural when it comes to “taking responsibility” for what his investigator Sue Gray found to be “failures of leadership”. What a tell. As he preferred it yesterday in his statement to the Commons: “We must look ourselves in the mirror, and we must learn.” Who’s we? Face it, Gary – he’s the least convincing man in the mirror since Michael Jackson. In fact, speaking of paedos, the prime minister chose to use one as a figleaf. Such a Churchill move. When the hour for leadership came, Johnson opted to knowingly advance a grotesque and indefensible conspiracist lie that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile when he was head of the Crown Prosecution Service. All Conservatives who regard themselves as decent need to ask if it’s really that much of a leap from this sort of thing to some of the other paedophile-based conspiracies that are increasingly part of the dangerous undertow of global populist policies. If they’re not up to it, it will continue. On past form, the Met will spend months not getting to the bottom of things. Should any fines be issued, I’m sure Johnson will get some Tory donor to set up a blind trust to pay for his. He should start running a cash phoneline during PMQs, like a proper televangelist. At least those who remember what the past two years were actually like – ie everyone – can be glad that Gray’s update acknowledged something crucial. Yes, she stated, working at Downing Street during the pandemic was challenging. “Those challenges, however, also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally, if not more, demanding conditions, often at a risk to their own health … The hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the government’s regulations and guidance rigorously are known only too well.” This is a vital counter to the frankly eye-popping number of anonymous exceptionalist briefings from Downing Street employees which talk about the “saviour complex” some staff apparently felt. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, no one has ended up being more elitist than the guys who swept to power promising to smash elites, but who turned out to regard themselves as miles above rules that were followed even in extremis by silly little people like the actual head of state. It wasn’t always this way. By chance, one of my children last week visited Bletchley Park, which as you know was the epicentre of the Allied code-breaking operation during the second world war, without which the war might not have been won, and where heroic efforts are judged to have shortened it by between two and four years. At Bletchley, he tells me, they only started serving beer at the end of a shift in 1944. To put that into perspective, by that stage there was a fourth rotor on the Enigma machine, meaning the possible combinations had leapt to truly head-frying levels, and the staff had been working round the clock at the facility for five years of global war under the constant threat of bombing. Flash forward to 2020. When they were getting pissed at 6pm in the garden in May, the desk johnnies of Downing Street had been stewarding a peacetime lockdown for TWO EFFING MONTHS. I mean, if you can’t do that without intravenous prosecco, then … buck up?! Run along and work in interiors PR? This is the same self-awareness-to-self-regard ratio as people who list their occupation as “film producer”. As things stand, insufficient numbers of Conservative MPs are prepared to wake up and smell the cordite. But all the Tories defending Johnson and skirting over these insults to ordinary people shouldn’t feel alone in the world. They have as their spiritual cousins all those craven Republicans who now refuse to condemn Donald Trump despite the fact they know he is a liar and a crook, know that he only cares about himself and thinks that rules are for little people, and know that he regards even them with a mixture of amusement and contempt. Backing Johnson in the face of all this is really not much different from scuttling down to Mar-a-Lago to pay obeisance and hoping you get smiled at. Come on – what’s the worst that can happen?

2/1/2022,"Lashana Lynch, who made history as the first black female 007 in No Time to Die, is one of five nominees for this year’s Bafta rising star award. The British actor has been shortlisted alongside Kodi Smit-McPhee, Millicent Simmonds, Ariana DeBose and Harris Dickinson for the only Bafta voted for by the British public.  Lynch’s standout role as Nomi in Cary Fukunaga’s Bond film drew international media attention. The 34-year-old west Londoner’s casting was part of a push by producers to keep 007 relevant for a contemporary audience. An Observer review said Lynch was “forcefully charismatic in a slightly underwritten role”. The actor’s upcoming projects include historical epic The Woman King, set in South Africa, and the film adaptation of the musical Matilda. Lynch said: “I’m so elated for my fellow nominees who inspire myself and others, as we continue to fight for change within our industry and the world. I’m proud to do that in moments like these.” Meanwhile, Australian actor Smit-McPhee, 25, has been called “the secret weapon” in Jane Campion’s trailblazing The Power of the Dog. He has already won a Golden Globe for his role as effeminate teenager Peter Gordon. His performance also earned him a nomination from the Screen Actors Guild and he was named best supporting actor by the New York Film Critics Circle. Smit-McPhee said that to be recognised by Bafta was to be “able to kind of redeem the blood, sweat and tears” that went into his work. He called Campion “a force of nature and a true genius” who constantly pushed him to be brave. The nominations were announced by last year’s winner, Bukky Bakray, on Tuesday. The prize has been running for 17 years and previous winners include James McAvoy, Kristen Stewart, Tom Hardy, Daniel Kaluuya and Tom Holland. This year’s selecting jury was made up of Bafta chair Krishnendu Majumdar, actors Sadie Frost and Michelle Dockery, casting directors Lucy Bevan and Leo Davis, producer Uzma Hasan and talent agent Ikki El-Amriti. Simmonds, 18, who found worldwide fame starring in 2018’s A Quiet Place and the 2021 sequel, becomes the award’s first deaf nominee. She said she’d had a lot of deaf young people tell her it was “really awesome to see our language, American Sign Language, on the big screen ... I didn’t have that growing up so I feel really honoured to give them a place where they can dream. It’s very inspirational for me.” DeBose’s performance in Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story has already earned her a Golden Globe and she’s also been longlisted in Bafta’s supporting actress category. The 31-year-old said she was “blown away” by the nomination, adding that she hopes the movie brings in more representation for Hispanic people in Hollywood. “There’s not one way to be Hispanic. You can be black and Puerto Rican at the same time,” she said. The list is completed by British actor Dickinson, 25, who stars in Matthew Vaughn’s The King’s Man. He said it meant a lot to be “noticed by such a prestigious institution”. Voting is now open at ee.co.uk/BAFTA and the winner will be announced at the Bafta ceremony on 13 March, which will be hosted by Rebel Wilson at the Royal Albert Hall.",Arts/Film,Bond actor Lashana Lynch nominated for Bafta rising star award,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/bond-actor-lashana-lynch-nominated-for-bafta-rising-star-award
2/1/2022,"I am in my mid-40s and married to an amazing woman. She is smart, funny and very attractive. We have three wonderful children. Over the past 18 months I have begun to suffer from premature ejaculation and a loss of firmness in my erections. While I have always felt reasonably competent in my sexual abilities, I have now lost all confidence. When my wife and I do have sex there is usually foreplay and my wife climaxes, but when I ejaculate (prematurely) I am left feeling deflated and inadequate. I am reasonably fit and do not drink often. I have become hyper aware of this issue and feel embarrassed to bring it up with my wife. I also feel that I have no one to confide in about this issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated. There may be a simple reason for this; for example, having three children in the house can curtail sexual activity so it becomes hurried and unsatisfying. Try finding some relaxed time to spend with your wife without fear of interruption. However, the symptoms you are experiencing should be investigated, as they can be signs of underlying medical conditions – and there could be psychological reasons, medication effects or other causes. Early ejaculation can usually be treated quite easily by a competent sex therapist, but it is important to understand why it is occurring. Pay attention, and understand this is not a failing.
