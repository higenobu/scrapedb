1/4/2022,"More than a dozen Queensland Covid-19 testing clinics were unexpectedly closed on Tuesday, creating chaos and waiting times of up to seven hours at other sites. In the 24 hours to 7pm on Monday, Queensland recorded 5,699 new Covid cases, another daily record and up by more than 1,000 on the previous day.  The state’s chief health officer said he expected total cases “in the hundreds of thousands, if not more” by the end of the month, as the highly infectious Omicron variant circulates. Testing sites were thrown into chaos as people arrived to find private clinics shuttered, despite the Queensland Health website showing they were open. The health minister, Yvette D’ath, said 17 private pathology sites were initially shown as reopening on Tuesday, but had not done so. In some cases, that was due to staffing issues at those facilities. Several people who contacted Guardian Australia said there had been confusion at those sites around the scheduled opening time. People then flocked to public testing sites, where wait times of up to seven hours were estimated. People were turned away from an open drive-through testing site at Murrarie due to traffic congestion. “There [are] very long lines at our testing clinics across the state,” D’ath said. “This is happening across the country. We are as prepared as we can be. “We can’t direct a public pathologist to open up, we can’t force their staff to go to work if they’re positive, we just can’t ask that. “We are seeing lines all over the country of people trying to get tests, [and] we know there is not sufficient supply of rapid antigen tests at the moment.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Tuesday, authorities confirmed the outbreak had spread to Aboriginal communities at Northern Peninsula, Woorabinda and Mornington Island in addition to growing outbreaks at Cherbourg and Palm Island. The state’s chief health officer, John Gerrard, said that of the more than 25,000 active cases in Queensland only 11 people were in intensive care, with two on ventilators. “We know there are going to be more than that,” Gerrard said. “The percentage of tests that are coming back positive has increased substantially in the past few days, [and] this suggests there are more people in the community with Covid-19 yet to be picked up. “This is a clearly very contagious virus, but the news so far, the good news, is we still as of last night only had 11 patients in intensive care. “The disease we’re seeing at the moment bears no resemblance to the disease we saw last year, both here and overseas – largely because of vaccination but also because [of the Omicron variant]. “The number of cases we’re expecting to see through January will be very high. Certainly in the hundreds of thousands, if not more in Queensland.”",News/Australia news,Queensland Covid update: people queuing for seven hours as private testing site closures cause chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/queensland-covid-update-people-queuing-for-seven-hours-as-private-testing-site-closures-cause-chaos
1/4/2022,"The Australian Medical Association warned senior executives in the federal health department of the need to develop a national strategy for procuring rapid antigen tests (RATs) in September last year. But the AMA’s vice-president, Chris Moy, said that he was told in the meeting that the government did not want to intervene in the private market.  “I asked the question of them because I knew what was happening in other countries, and we needed to transition, so what was the plan?,” Moy told Guardian Australia. “We needed to get a lot of them (RATs), and we needed a really clear strategy to transition, it was so bloody obvious. “They have been caught short because of Omicron and the number of cases, but the bottom line is if you are going to rely on the private market in a health emergency you need to make pretty damn sure that they are ready.” The Morrison government is under growing pressure to provide free rapid antigen tests across the community as case numbers in Australia reach record highs while testing clinics remain overwhelmed. On Tuesday, New South Wales and Victoria registered record daily case numbers. NSW had 23,131 new cases, while Victoria recorded 14,020. Queensland registered a record 5,699 cases, while Tasmania had 702 and the ACT had 926. On Monday, there were 2,552 cases in South Australia, 58 in the Northern Territory and two in Western Australia. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the government will not make the rapid tests free for everyone, but is in the process of finalising concessional access with state and territory leaders. National cabinet is expected to sign off on the details in a meeting on Wednesday. Regardless of the cost, supplies remain constrained in the private market across the country, with frustration growing that the tests cannot be found on chemist and supermarket shelves. The Queensland health minister, Yvette D’Ath, said that Queensland would distribute 500,000 RATs to public testing clinics from tomorrow, but supplies remain constrained across the country. “This is happening across the country. We are as prepared as we can be, but have a look at what is happening around the world,” she said. “This is not unique to Australia. There is not one country, there is not one state who can say that we don’t have lines, that you won’t have to wait for tests now.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said RATs needed to be “heavily subsidised” or made free to ensure equity of access. “We do want to make sure they are affordable, we do want to make sure people have easy access to them and we don’t want to become a society where only those who can afford it get it.” She said she had also appealed to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to fast-track any outstanding approvals for test kits, including those made in Australia. The Queensland chief health officer, John Gerrard, said the Omicron virus had changed the pandemic landscape, with each infected person now infecting between seven and 10 people. “The Omicron strain really has changed everything – I know it sounds like a cliche, but that has completely changed all the planning,” Gerrard said.

And his job is to ensure supply, just like it was his job to secure supply of the vaccine,” Albanese said. But the opposition leader fell short of saying the tests should be made free. “We think that if someone needs a rapid antigen test, and they can’t afford it, they should get one. Everyone should have access to a rapid antigen test. It shouldn’t be dependent upon your income.” The Nationals senator Matt Canavan said the TGA was to blame for the hold-up, and said making the tests free would exacerbate demand. “The hold-up was at the feet of the TGA,” he told Sky News on Tuesday. “We should have been better prepared for this.”",News/Australia news,"Morrison government warned about lack of rapid antigen tests in September, AMA claims",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/morrison-government-warned-about-lack-of-rapid-antigen-tests-in-september-ama-claims
