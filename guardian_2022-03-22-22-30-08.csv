3/22/2022,"Every so often it pays to look in the mirror. Who are we as a country? What do we look like? And then perhaps to look at the mirror itself. Is the reflection a true one?The government has been given that opportunity after being obliged to respond to the issues and assertions raised by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities released last March, otherwise known as the Sewell report.It called for reflection on a massive scale. The Sewell report, we should not forget, was a response to the biggest and longest race protest in the UK in recent memory. It was also the most divisive, inaccurate and politically driven race equality report ever written.With Sewell and his allies having failed to grasp the moment, and ministers mindful of the huge public backlash to the report having adjudicated, how should we see ourselves? In marginally better shape, perhaps. But in terms of equality, anti-racism and life chances, no one can plausibly say we are in good health.There is good news. Let’s start with that. For the first time, the government has acknowledged that Black and Asian communities, who are some of the poorest in the north of England, could be beneficiaries of levelling up. It’s not much. But it suggests a dilution of the culture wars approach that said ‘taking the knee”, for example, is somehow against the interest of white working-class people.How much of that recalibration is due to the fact that the driving force behind the Sewell report, Munira Mirza, the former policy adviser at No 10, is no longer in post? With her gone, has Sewell’s influence itself been diluted? I was one of the first to give evidence to his commission. For an hour and half, Sewell clearly and unapologetically paid little attention to my plea for a comprehensive race equality strategy based on the glaring inequalities. Instead of listening to me, he paraded his own mindset. “Simon, it’s a class rather than a race thing,” he said. “That’s where our focus should be.” I, while not denying huge class inequalities, informed Sewell that his commission was tasked to deal with race inequality – which, if he bothered to look, stares relentlessly at us from every social demographic of Black, Asian and minority ethnic life in Britain, but particularly in working-class communities. It is a measure of the report’s failure that even this illiberal government has sought to distance itself from it, but the fix devised by ministers is a mass of contradictions. They admit that racism exists but insist it’s not systemic, yet they then call for a systemic approach. They claim race inequality campaigners uphold race as the sole discriminatory factor. That is not true. It has never been true. The world is complicated and discrimination is multifacted. When you consider the brutal violation of Child Q, the 15-year-old black girl so outrageously strip-searched by the police at school, you see violations of race, class and gender in one act, all at once.There are reasons now to be relieved (but certainly not grateful). At last, the government demands better practices from stop and search; black youths are nine times more likely to be subjected to the humiliating ordeal. Ministers talk about strengthening the Equality and Human Rights Commission to take on more race inequality cases. That sounds hopeful, but what about the money? I know as a former equalities commissioner that its budget was slashed by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition from £70m to £17m. That was how much they cared then. Do they care so much more now?And do they care about health, education and fair pay, as each affects minority communities? We don’t really know, because all are partially addressed: the subjects of warm words and partial promises.There has been no giant leap. There is still no overall race equality strategy rooted in policy or direct action initiatives. What we have is hotch-potch assurances predicated on more research, which will probably take another couple of years. Were you hoping for sustainable equality or even a proper step towards it? You’ll have a long wait. In May 2020, George Floyd was murdered. Global protests began and here in Britain, hundreds of thousands of young black and white protesters took to the streets. Some people, aping the words of Sewell’s report, patronised their “well-meaning idealism”, but they couldn’t have been more wrong. Surely it was realism – about where we are as a society and where we should be – that drove their calls for real racial equality and lasting change.So after Sewell, after the government’s response, what do they now see when they look in society’s mirror? A different reflection from much of their country, a society still distorted by unfairness. It shames us that this disparity, in lives and perception, endures.

3/22/2022,"Iread a book called You’re Not Listening, by Kate Murphy, which was designed to make the reader a better listener. It worked. I now listen my socks off. I listen to my girlfriend, I listen to my mum and, yeah, I even listen to my child – and he’s six. You know when you catch yourself doing something you remember your own parents doing? Mine was a “mmhmm” sort of noise. I made it when my son was wanging on about the height of a spinosaurus’s crest, or something. “Mmhmm.” Out it came. The noise. From me. And I thought: I did that to pretend I’m listening, but I’m not. In that moment, I realised my parents hadn’t really listened to anything I had said until I was about 32. Fair enough. It’s hard. Apparently, the people who are in our lives every day are the ones we become least curious about, so they are the first people we stop really listening to. To compound that, listening to a child is like visiting a museum: full of fascinating things, yes, but there’s only so much you can absorb before the thought of the gift shop makes your mouth water. I had been terrible at listening, so I’ve consciously upped my game and will continue to do so. But at what cost? The terrible side-effect of this new effort, which the book fails to mention, is that I’ve realised how few of the people I talk to are paying attention to me. At all. Ever. People finish my sentences. Everybody is shouting at once. People ask me things, then, as I answer, they get their phones out. It’s awful. Surely life was far sweeter before I noticed these things.

3/22/2022,"Chris Mullin, the journalist and former MP, has won the right to protect his sources in a historic freedom of the press case at the Old Bailey. Judge Lucraft ruled that it was not in the public interest to force Mullin to hand over data that would identify a man who had confessed his role in the 1971 Birmingham pub bombings many years ago. West Midlands police had applied under the Terrorism Act 2000 to require Mullin to disclose material dating back to his investigation in 1985-1986 that led to the successful appeal of the six men wrongly accused of the Birmingham pub bombings. Mullin had refused to divulge the information that could identify the man who had confessed his role in the bombings to him in an interview. Mullin had promised to protect the man’s identity in exchange for information that would help exonerate the six. Twenty-one people were killed in the bomb attacks on two pubs in Birmingham in November 1974. In a lengthy written judgment, Lucraft concluded: “Whilst I can see the benefit likely to accrue to a terrorist investigation if the material is obtained, having regard to the circumstances under which Chris Mullin has the material in his possession, custody or power, I do not feel that the material should be procured or that access should be given to it.” The judgment accepted the arguments put forward by Mullin’s barrister, Gavin Millar QC, at last month’s hearing that the public interest was strong. “The journalism in issue was of the highest public interest value exposing serious failings on the part of the criminal justice system which resulted in the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of six innocent men.” Outside the court, standing where he had famously stood in 1991 with the Birmingham Six after their successful appeal, Mullin said: “The right of a journalist to protect his or her sources is fundamental to a free press in a democracy. My actions in this case were overwhelmingly in the public interest. They led to the release of six innocent men after 17 years in prison, the winding up of the notorious West Midlands serious crimes squad and the quashing of a further 30 or so wrongful convictions. “This case also resulted in the setting up of a royal commission which, among other reforms, led to the setting up of the criminal cases review commission and the quashing of another 500 or more wrongful convictions, most recently those of the many sub-postmasters wrongly convicted of fraud and theft. My investigation is also the main reason why the identity of three of the four bombers is known. Finally, I am grateful to the National Union of Journalists for their unswerving support.” His solicitor, Louis Charalambous, said: “This is a landmark freedom of expression decision which properly recognises the public interest in Chris Mullin’s journalism which led to the release of the Birmingham Six. If a confidential source cannot rely on a journalist’s promise of lifelong protection, then these investigations will never see the light of day.” The judge also lifted a restriction under section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 after a challenge by five media organisations, including the Guardian. The restriction meant that the true identity of the bomber could not be mentioned in the original hearing, in which he was described as AB. He has since been widely identified in the media as a “critical suspect”. Mullin had come under pressure from West Midland police to reveal his data when they reopened the investigation into the bombings in 2019. Relatives of victims of the bombings and their organisation, Justice 4 for the 21, have attacked Mullin for refusing to hand over his unredacted notes and some have called him “scum”. In his statement to the hearing last month, Mullin aid: “I hold no brief for the terrorists responsible for this atrocity … I have every sympathy with those whose loved ones died, and were I in their place I, too, would want those responsible to face justice.” Responding to today’s decision, the assistant chief constable of West Midlands police, Matt Ward, said: “This was a complex issue balancing the need to pursue all significant lines of inquiry related to the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings against the rights of journalists to keep the sources of their information confidential. The court has given its independent judgment, which we will now consider carefully. West Midlands police remains committed to bringing to justice those responsible for the murder of 21 innocent victims.” In the hearing last month, statements on Mullin’s behalf were submitted by a former lord chancellor, Charles Falconer, the former editor of the Guardian Alan Rusbridger, and the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, Michelle Stanistreet.",News/Media,Birmingham pub bombings: court allows Chris Mullin to keep source secret ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/22/birmingham-pub-bombings-chris-mullin-wins-fight-to-protect-source
3/22/2022,"NatWest is to join the booming but controversial “buy now, pay later” market this summer, becoming the first UK high street bank to announce a move into the multibillion-pound sector. The bank is still majority taxpayer-owned – though only just, as the government stake is now about 51% – after a state bailout during the financial crisis. Its 18 million-plus customers may be surprised to learn it is to offer this form of unregulated credit, which lets people delay payment for items ranging from clothes to pet food. However, NatWest said there was “a clear demand” for buy now, pay later (BNPL), and it was determined “to make it better and safer”. BNPL lets shoppers stagger payments for goods with no interest or charges – unless they fail to pay back on time, at which point some firms impose late fees. Typically the cost is split into weekly, fortnightly or monthly instalments. The three main BNPL firms are Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy, and this form of credit has enjoyed explosive growth during the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among under-30s and those with tight finances. NatWest is not the first UK bank to move into this sector: the online-only bank Monzo launched a BNPL product in September 2021. A year earlier, PayPal entered the market with its “Pay in 3” product. However, NatWest is the biggest UK household name to start offering this payment method and it has a huge customer base to market it to. NatWest said it intended to launch its BNPL product this summer. The bank has not yet spelt out precisely how it will work, though it said that, as with the other schemes, it would split purchases into several repayments. It would also “give customers the convenience to make a purchase almost anywhere that accepts Mastercard” – meaning it will be available for both online and in-person purchases. Like Monzo, NatWest will offer its customers a credit limit that they will know in advance, and those who take advantage of the service will be able to manage it within the bank’s app. A NatWest spokesperson said transactions would be covered “by all the protections customers expect from a fully regulated bank”. Many consumer bodies and politicians have expressed concern about the rapid rise of BNPL, with Which? magazine saying in January that stronger safeguards were needed to protect users because many people did not realise they were taking on debt. In response to the concerns, the government has announced that BNPL is to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, though the rules are unlikely to take effect until later this year or in 2023.",News/Business,"NatWest to launch ‘buy now, pay later’ credit scheme this summer",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/natwest-to-launch-buy-now-pay-later-credit-scheme-this-summer
3/22/2022,"Alisher Usmanov, the Russian oligarch once said to be the UK’s richest person, claims to have placed hundreds of millions of pounds of his assets into an irrevocable trust, potentially leaving them outside the sanctions regime established by western governments. The tycoon – a former 30% shareholder in Arsenal football club who has also ploughed millions into sponsoring Everton and is subject to sanctions – can today be revealed as connected to at least six luxury UK properties and one central London office building, collectively worth more than £170m and held via a complex web of offshore companies and family members. The list of assets linked to Usmanov has been compiled by the Russian asset tracker, a partnership involving the Guardian, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and other international news organisations that are reporting on the wealth of Russia’s most powerful operators. The project has also found evidence that the oligarch has: Close relatives who are named as the owners of luxury properties in countries including Italy, Germany and Latvia. The use of a $350m private jet and a helicopter deregistered from the Isle of Man on the day Usmanov was sanctioned by the UK, plus another now deregistered from Luxembourg, the LX-VIP. A 512ft, $600m private yacht called Dilbar, along with a concession to moor the vessel until 2036 in Barcelona port, which is thought to be worth about $20m. The Russian asset tracker serves as a snapshot in time, and includes assets only where reporters have seen documentary evidence or other reliable information linking them to those under sanctions. The purpose of the Russia sanctions is to punish those accused of supporting the Putin regime from enjoying their wealth. The complicated structures under which assets linked to Usmanov are held shows how difficult they are to enforce. In response to questions from the Guardian about the ownership of these luxury assets, a spokesperson for Usmanov revealed that most of the billionaire’s UK properties, as well as his yacht, had been “long ago transferred into irrevocable trusts”. He added: “From that point on, Mr Usmanov did not own them, nor was he able to manage them or deal with their sale, but could only use them on a rental basis. Mr Usmanov withdrew from the beneficiaries of the trusts, donating his beneficial rights to his family.” Data from UK and offshore registries had previously appeared to show Usmanov’s assets as held by companies and trusts that he controlled. An irrevocable trust cannot be altered without the permission of beneficiaries. The individual who puts the assets into the trust – called a grantor - in effect removes their ownership rights to the assets. Irrevocable trusts are generally set up to minimise taxes or protect assets. Usmanov’s spokesperson would not reveal exactly when the irrevocable trust had been established, or give its name or jurisdiction, and he would not say when Usmanov withdrew from the list of beneficiaries, or if those moves had been triggered by the threat of sanctions. However, he implied that the trust now ultimately owned Usmanov’s Beechwood House in Highgate, north London, worth an estimated £48m, and his £34m 16th-century Sutton Place estate in Surrey. Both properties were cited by the UK government when it announced this month that it was freezing Usmanov’s assets. Sutton Place is owned by Delesius Investments Limited and Bacerius Investments Limited, which are both incorporated in Cyprus, while Beechwood House is owned by Isle of Man-based Hanley Limited, according to Land Registry records. Experts suggested UK authorities would struggle to use the current sanction regime on families of individuals who had been subject to sanctions, even if they believed any rules were being breached. James Birkett, a sanctions expert at the business intelligence firm Alaco, said: “The challenge would be identifying and evidencing these relationships [between the sanctioned individual and family members and associates] – both given the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation’s (OFSI) well-known capacity constraints and the ability to obfuscate the ownership of assets via offshore structures. “It is likely that such a move would be subject to legal challenge and OFSI would want to be pretty sure it could avoid the embarrassment of being required to reverse its decision ... Nobody is really going after family members yet. It would be a step-change in how the programmes have been applied.”",News/World news,Alisher Usmanov’s assets may be out of reach of sanctions regime,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/alisher-usmanov-ex-arsenal-shareholder-russian-bilionaire-assets-sanctions
3/22/2022,"For sanctions to work, governments and law enforcement agencies need to know who owns what. And that is not always an easy task. Take this luxury home in north London, surrounded by period properties and manicured gardens just five minutes’ walk from Hampstead Heath. It was bought by the oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2004 for £2.15m. He was added to the EU sanctions list this month. Five years later, in October 2009, the tycoon gave the property “not for money” to his longtime associate and now owner of Everton football club, Farhad Moshiri, according to Land Registry documents. Four months after that, registry documents record Moshiri giving the house to his sister, who owned it for a further four months before raising a mortgage on her new home via the private bank Coutts. Neither Moshiri nor his sister responded to questions about this series of transactions. Less than 500 metres away lies another Hampstead home that also demonstrates how close the two businessmen were. It was also bought by Usmanov, this time in 2011 for £15.8m, according to the Land Registry, although the public is unlikely to have ever have spotted the transaction. Usmanov appears to have acquired the property anonymously via an Isle of Man company. The island’s corporate registry makes it difficult to discover the individual owners of companies. This firm received a loan from another related company, called Pauillac Property, which was ultimately owned by Usmanov. The trail was only discovered thanks to documents leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and seen by the Guardian. Intriguingly, the Guardian also understands that this house – which is staffed by guards positioned behind security gates – is now the UK home of Moshiri, who was said to be worth £2bn in last year’s Sunday Times Rich List. Through his spokesperson at the PR firm Finsbury Glover Hering – who, until recently, also worked for Usmanov – Moshiri said he had acquired the offshore company that owns the property from the oligarch in 2014 for “north of £18m”. He added that Usmanov no longer had any interest in either north London property. The transaction does not appear on the Land Registry – and therefore avoided public scrutiny – because Moshiri acquired the house by buying the offshore company that owns the home from the oligarch.",News/World news,"The oligarch, the Everton owner and the mysterious £2m London house",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/oligarch-everton-owner-london-house-farhad-moshiri-alisher-usmanov
3/22/2022,"At one point in this unsettling paranoia thriller, a character warns protagonist James (Harry Shum Jr) that he’s at risk of going down “a rabbit hole”. Just in case you didn’t catch that Lewis Carroll reference, another character who helps James out on his quest is a young woman with long flowing hair named Alice (Kelley Mack). There’s a bad guy who wears a hat later on too, but that might be an exegesis too far. Nevertheless, director Jacob Gentry’s horror-tinged drama, its script by Phil Drinkwater and Tim Woodall, ventures into the oneiric underground world of conspiracy theories and creepy online culture in 1999, when the latter at any rate was only just getting started. Like the recent British horror feature Censor or 2012’s Berberian Sound Studio, this harks back to an era dominated by analogue technology, a time when it was possible, as is the case here, for hackers to interrupt regularly scheduled terrestrial programming with a clip of someone in an uncanny kabuki mask making freaky weird noises that just might make sense if played backwards. James comes across the clip because it’s his job to transfer broadcast material to a different media for archival purposes, but something in the “intrusion” haunts his already fragile mind. His ballet dancer wife, you see, went missing a few years ago and was never found, and her disappearance was put down to probable suicide. But what if there was a different explanation, and maybe the intrusion and the disappearance of other missing women were all connected? Until the finale, when things go seriously awry, Gentry keeps teasing that there will be a plausible explanation for all this – be it the revelation of an actual conspiracy or just the side effects of fevered imaginations twisted by grief and loneliness. But that just-inside-the-realism line writes a cheque the film can’t cash. You kind of hope it will go full-on Lost Highway/Mulholland Drive-era David Lynch, but no joy there either. Still, Shum is quite empathic as the troubled hero, even when he keeps passively accepting the most outlandish suggestions from near perfect strangers. Even the little girl protagonist of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland was more curious.

3/22/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. I’m going to begin this week’s Pushing Buttons with a personal plea to game developers and publishers: could you stop announcing huge news in the hours before (or just after) my newsletter deadline, please!? I basically had this week’s missive nailed down, and then CD Projekt Red went and confirmed the next game in the Witcher series, so now I’ve gotta talk about that. There are almost no details about the game yet – just confirmation that it’s being made (in Unreal Engine 5, for the tech nerds). But this is still a big deal, because The Witcher 3 in particular is one of the most interesting and beloved (and successful) fantasy games ever made. It’s sold over 30 million copies; the series has topped 50 million in total. If you’ve never had the pleasure, The Witcher stars a grizzled and fairly indifferent white-haired monster-hunter called Geralt. He is an outcast, a sword-for-hire who’s lived a long and interesting life – more of an antihero than your traditional wide-eyed, world-saving naif fantasy protagonist. Geralt doesn’t have the power to save the world the Witcher drops you into. It is a world at the mercy of idiot kings and their wars, drunk nobles, criminals both petty and organised, and a whole menagerie of aggressive creatures that happily rip peasants apart. This ain’t a happy place, and you can’t make it better – but you can get to know it, quite intimately, and as Geralt you can at least make something of a difference. The reason The Witcher has stuck in my memory is its moral ambiguity, and the fact that you are no doubt a powerful character, albeit one who is not omnipotent. Geralt makes mistakes and reflects on his choices. He has failed relationships and intriguing regrets and all the other trappings of a life. And he’s not the only interesting character in this series; most of them have some gnarly qualities, and few are straightforwardly evil. I’m not saying The Witcher handles everything with nuance and subtlety – there is one quest in The Witcher 3 where you basically have to fight an aborted fetus, which is absolutely not the pinnacle of taste. But it has more bite than most games. Considering its narrative spans 100 hours or more, it’s admirable that it manages to be interesting for almost that entire time. The next Witcher game will be the fourth: Polish developer CD Projekt Red’s history with The Witcher began in around the late 90s, when it bought the rights to Andrzej Sapkowski’s fantasy novels. (The 73-year-old writer remains famously uninterested in the video games that bear his creation’s name, by the way – and seems quite annoyed that he doesn’t profit from them.) The first Witcher game came out in 2007, when I was a baby journalist: I reviewed it at the time and remember it as a slightly shonky but nonetheless interesting action-RPG, with fiddly combat, a surprisingly rich story and – of course, infamously – a series of collectible cards with nudie ladies on them that you acquired by completing “seduction quests” with various female characters. (Gotta catch ’em all, I guess.) I never would have expected at that time that this game, not to mention this developer, would become one of the world’s most successful. Another interesting wrinkle here is that this next game will be the studio’s first since Cyberpunk 2077, a game whose launch in 2020 was, famously, an absolute disaster. Despite years in development, extensive crunch and the presence of Keanu Reeves as a prominent character, it launched in an absolute state. And even after the technical problems were (very slowly) solved, the game remained a depressingly cliché-ridden and unambitious take on the ideas of cyberpunk that felt inescapably adolescent. I wonder what creative lessons (and workplace-environment lessons) CD Projekt Red will have taken from that experience. I wouldn’t expect this game to come out before 2024, by the way. Still, that gives you time to play through the rest of them in preparation. I spent nearly 200 hours on The Witcher 3 and its expansions and still didn’t finish it, so there’s plenty for you to get lost in. I have been looking forward to paranormal Japanese ghost-punching action game Ghostwire: Tokyo for a long time, and it’s out this Friday. If you have ever spent any time in Japan’s mesmerising capital, seeing this eerily deserted version of it will give you feelings, especially as you explore the stories (and meet the abandoned pets) of the people who used to live there. This is actually an endearingly old-school game: no padding, just an extremely good gameplay idea (fighting ghosts with magic) executed brilliantly and with great visual flair. Beware, though: this game is seriously spooky. I’m of a nervous disposition and it is creeping me out. Available on: PC, PlayStation 5Approximate playtime: 15-20 hours Players of the spectacularly nerdy PlayStation racing sim Gran Turismo 7 are rather upset with changes to the game that make the most desirable cars inordinately expensive, all but necessitating that players pay real money for in-game credits to acquire them. Given that the game already costs £70 (and the grind for new cars was harsh even at launch, as the Guardian’s review pointed out), it’s understandable that people are miffed. An open letter organised by advocacy group Color of Change calls upon Twitch to do more to protect Black video game streams from racist abuse – particularly “hate raids”: co-ordinated harassment events where people flood a streamer’s comments with the intent to cause harm. The letter calls out Twitch’s Black history month events as “performative” and calls for better human and algorithmic moderation, alongside a commitment from Twitch to racial equity at the company. Mega-publisher EA has decided to cancel EA Play, its annual games showcase that usually happens at the same time as E3, the games industry’s bombastic show-and-tell event in June. This is interesting because it further undermines E3 itself: even when big game publishers desert the show, they still hold their own events on its schedule, in the summer. It looks like the gaming news could be more evenly spread throughout the year in future.
