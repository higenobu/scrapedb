4/5/2022,"The industry player most likely to buy Channel 4, with the least regulatory hurdles, is Discovery. The big US pay-TV company, which is merging with WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN, HBO and the Hollywood studio behind the Batman and Harry Potter franchises, expressed interest the last time the broadcaster faced privatisation in 2016. The company, which has a mix of free and pay-TV operations, continues to be highly active in the UK market, striking a deal with BT in February to launch a pay-TV sports joint venture including BT Sport, which has rights to sports including football’s Premier League and Champions League. However, ITV has been lobbying Whitehall about the possibility of a “national champion” takeover, designed to take the political fallout of yet another buyout of a UK “crown jewel” by a foreign owner. The issue for ITV, which said in the noughties that it would bid for Channel 4 if it was combined with another broadcaster as was mooted with Channel 5, is that it would create what amounts to a TV advertising monopoly resulting in significant competition issues. There will also be significant interest from private equity buyers, although Channel 4’s remit would have to be changed to allow a non-trade buyer to make profits from the business. Channel 4’s remit has never been to make a profit – the money it makes is reinvested in commissioning and buying programmes from mostly British TV production companies, helping to support a key national industry. Analysts believe that a privatised Channel 4 would face 40% to 50% cuts to its £660m programming budget – spent on content such as news and current affairs, Gogglebox and It’s a Sin – to force its model into that of a commercially-focused broadcaster. This is likely to mean cuts to content that does not bring in much income from advertising, which Channel 4 relies on for more than 90% of its £1bn annual revenues, such as news. Channel 4 is a key commissioner of TV content from production companies based around the UK and sees itself as a key part of the government’s “levelling up” ambitions outside London. Analysts believe that as many 60 TV production companies around the UK could be forced to shut if Channel 4 moved to private ownership. Channel 4 was established by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1982 to provide a culturally challenging alternative to BBC One, BBC Two and ITV. It is publicly owned but commercially funded. Unlike the BBC, which is funded through the £159-a-year licence fee its viewers must pay, Channel 4 has no financial support from the taxpayer. While a price tag of £1bn was attached to the broadcaster at the last privatisation push, it is very difficult to provide a current estimate. Unlike rivals such as ITV and the BBC, Channel 4’s remit means it does not have its own in-house production arm. While it has rights to show programmes on linear TV and on its streaming services in the UK, the broadcaster does not own the rights to commercialise those shows around the world. The ownership of must-watch, “crown jewel” content has been the driver of the wave of media mergers and takeovers seen in recent years. Any potential buyer would need Channel 4’s model to be allowed to be drastically changed to increase margins and commercial opportunities. Privatisation in some form has been mooted about half a dozen times since Channel 4’s launch, with the most serious push coming under David Cameron’s government in 2016. That was led by the then culture secretary John Whittingdale, who is also overseeing the government’s latest push towards privatisation. Ultimately, it was decided that the benefits of a cash windfall to the government were outweighed by the scale of the detrimental impact on the independent TV sector. In 2017, the culture secretary Karen Bradley formally ruled privatisation out, saying Channel 4 was a “precious public asset” that would “continue to be owned by the country”. Instead, the government pushed for Channel 4 to relocate significant parts of its operations and staff out of London. About 300 of its 800 staff have now moved to new “national” headquarters in Leeds, as well as “creative hubs” in Bristol and Glasgow.",News/Media,What you need to know about the privatisation of Channel 4,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-privatisation-of-channel-4
4/5/2022,"Unions representing parliamentary staff have called for MPs accused of sexual misconduct to be excluded from the Westminster estate while investigations take place, after allegations against the Conservative backbencher David Warburton. The joint call by unions representing parliamentary workers – Prospect, the FDA, the Public and Commercial Services Union and the GMB - comes after Warburton was accused of sexual harassment as well as alleged cocaine use and potentially failing to declare a loan. The MP for Somerton and Frome has denied any wrongdoing, and has been taken to a psychiatric hospital. He has lost the Tory whip and is expected to face a series of investigations over the claims. In a statement, the unions said they had written to Karen Bradley, who chairs the cross-party Commons procedure committee that examines the working practices of the Commons. They have asked Bradley to look at whether it might be practicable to introduce a rule meaning anyone being investigated over sexual misconduct is kept away from the parliamentary estate during any investigations. The idea was also proposed in a report by the Commons women and equalities committee into helping to create a more gender-sensitive parliament. Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said such a measure was long overdue: “We are again in the situation where an MP, accused of a serious offence, is technically free to come and go as he pleases. This is a ridiculous oversight that will leave people questioning parliament’s commitment to keeping its staff safe.” Bradley should act to “bring parliament into the 21st century as an employer,” Graham said. “In no other workplace would someone subject to such serious allegations receive only a voluntary ban.” The allegations of misconduct, made by three women according to the Sunday Times, would be investigated by parliament’s independent complaints and grievance scheme, which does not comment on ongoing cases. Warburton could also be investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards over a loan he received in 2017 of close to £150,000 for a holiday rental property, if this was not properly registered. The loan, which has now been repaid, was provided by Roman Joukovski, a financial adviser who specialised in offshore tax advice and providing tier one “golden” investor visas. Finally, Warburton could potentially face an inquiry by police after media reports about the claims included a photograph of him with lines of a white powder, allegedly reported to be cocaine. The Sunday Times said two former aides to Warburton had made complaints about him, and that the fact he employs his wife, Harriet, whose role includes human resources issues, made it harder for them to take action. A cabinet minister defended the working practice of MPs employing relatives, which was banned for new MPs from 2017, saying it was “really productive”. Simon Hart, the Wales secretary, who employs his wife, told Times Radio he was a “staunch defender” of the idea. “I think that’s actually pretty insulting towards so many husbands wives and partners who do a really good job in parliament, work bloody hard, and provide the taxpayer real value for money,” he said.",News/Politics,Unions call for Westminster ban for MPs accused of sexual misconduct ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/04/unions-call-for-westminster-ban-for-mps-accused-of-sexual-misconduct
4/5/2022,"Bird populations in a Central American tropical rainforest are suffering severe declines, with likely factors including climate breakdown and habitat loss. Scientists from the University of Illinois tracked species of birds in a protected forest reserve in central Panama to determine if and how populations had changed from 1977 to 2020. There are very few long-term studies on population trends for tropical birds, and the report provides insights into how they are coping with habitat loss and the climate crisis. A new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the majority of sampled species had declined in abundance, many of them severely. Twice a year over four decades, the authors deployed mist nets in multiple study sites, identifying and banding thousands of birds. Next, the authors modelled populations and estimated changes in the abundance of 57 species. Of the species sampled, 35 out of 40 lost more than 50% of their initial abundance. Only two species increased in numbers. The declines extended across different bird families and were generally independent of ecological traits such as body mass, foraging type, or the species’ initial abundance. According to the authors, establishing declines and identifying the underlying ecological mechanisms should be a conservation priority. The scientists said human activity was likely to be driving the drops in numbers, with changing rainfall patterns, increasing temperatures and deforestation causing stress to bird populations. They said: “Deforestation in the humid tropics accelerated 62% between 1990 and 2010, resulting in a net loss of about 8m hectares (20m acres) during this time period, and losses have continued to accrue in recent years. “Increasing temperatures are driving upslope range shifts of lowland tropical species across [taxonomic groups] and both theoretical and empirical evidence indicate that tropical biotas are more strongly affected than their temperate counterparts. Changing rainfall regimes in the tropics are also expected to strongly impact species’ distributions and population dynamics.” Another factor in the decline could be the indirect impact of the climate emergency. The insects the birds feed on are sensitive to changing temperature and rainfall, and droughts as well as irregular rainfall can affect the seasonal availability of fruit and nectar. There are also concerns the change in climate could be benefitting parasites that weaken the birds. The scientists said the losses were “alarming”, with a range of species affected, including the red-capped manakin, the most abundant fruit-eating bird sampled and an important seed disperser. In 1977, 23 were spotted, but in 2020, just nine were captured. Researchers said that though tropical forests are often thought to be “reservoirs of biodiversity”, this study suggests there are worrying declines in species populations. They concluded more studies are needed, writing: “The next logical step toward understanding and possibly preventing further declines is identifying the underlying ecological mechanisms. To accomplish this, intensive, long-term studies of individual species will likely be needed to drill down to the factors.”",News/Environment,"Bird populations in Panama rainforest in severe decline, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/bird-populations-in-panama-rainforest-in-severe-decline-study-finds
4/5/2022,"The West must not lift sanctions against Russia until all its troops have left Ukraine and Vladimir Putin is unable to mount such an offensive again, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. She was speaking alongside the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in Warsaw, where the two discussed how to step up sanctions against Russia to the maximum in the wake of the alleged war crimes revealed in Bucha. She said: “There should be no talk of removing sanctions, while Putin’s troops are in Ukraine, and the threat of Russian aggression looms over Europe. We need to see Putin withdraw his troops. We need to see Ukraine’s full territorial integrity restored. We need to see Russia’s ability for further aggression stopped.” She said the sanctions had already set back Russia’s economy by 15 years, but now it was necessary to go to the maximum level of sanctions since the worst in terms of atrocities had already happened. She said she believed Vladimir Putin only responded to force, adding the UK intends to press for a timetable to end western dependency on Russian energy to be agreed at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to be attended by Germany and Italy, two of the countries most dependent on Russian energy. Kuleba urged any foreign minister thinking of voting against such an embargo to come first to visit the mass graves in Ukraine, adding half measures are no longer enough. He said he feared the bodies discovered in Bucha were just the tip of the iceberg and worse horrors will be uncovered when the siege of Mariupol is lifted. “I can tell you without an exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse compared to what we’ve seen in Bucha and others cities, towns and villages near Kiev,” he said. At a press conference after their meeting Truss announced an extra £10m in UK funding to help victims of sexual violence in the conflict, as well as technical advice including from the Metropolitan police to help Ukraine gather evidence of war crimes. She said: “I am afraid it is not the end of the atrocities, and we should simply not be doing business with Putin. “We have seen butchery, evidence of rape and sexual violence, as well as the indiscriminate killing of civilians. We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice for these barbaric crimes. And, together with our allies, we will step up our efforts to stop Putin’s appalling war.” Although she said it is very clear that war crimes have taken place, she said it was for the courts to decide if this amounted to genocide, the claim already made by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Both ministers joined the US call for Russia to be expelled from the UN Human Rights Council. Calling for a tough new wave of sanctions, Truss said: “The reality is that money is still flowing from the west into Putin’s war machine. That has to stop.” She called for a ban on Russian ships in European ports, closure of Russian banks’ access to international payment systems, a clampdown on Russian gold sales by the Russian central bank as well as the timetable to end dependency on Russian energy.",News/World news,"Sanctions on Russia must stay till all troops leave Ukraine, says Liz Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/sanctions-on-russia-must-stay-till-all-troops-leave-ukraine-says-liz-truss
4/5/2022,"A woman has died in east London after eating a suspected cannabis sweet. The 23-year-old from Ilford bought the “gummies” via a messaging app on her phone and they were delivered to her home in Ilford on 29 March, the Metropolitan police said. The sweets came in packaging branded “Trrlli Peachie O’s”. The woman and her 21-year-old friend ate one each and immediately became ill. Paramedics were called to the house on the same night, and the two women were taken to hospital. Despite treatment the 23-year-old, who has not yet been named, died on 2 April. A postmortem is still to take place. Her friend has been discharged from hospital. Leon Brown, 37, from Croydon, has been charged with possession with intent to supply a class B synthetic cannabidoid, being concerned in the supply of a synthetic cannabinoid and possession with intent to supply a psychoactive substance. He was arrested on Friday in connection with the death. Scotland Yard said he was found in possession of a large quantity of money and what were believed to be edible cannabis products. He was to appear at Barkingside magistrates court on Monday. Some of the sweets have been recovered and are now being tested. Officers believe the case could be linked to another incident in March in which a woman was taken to hospital after eating a cannabis sweet in nearby Tower Hamlets. She has since been discharged, but an investigation is under way to find out whether the sweet was from the same batch involved in the Ilford death, and to examine whether there are any other similar incidents. Ch Supt Stuart Bell said: “I must warn the public against taking any illegal substances, including those packaged in the form of cannabis sweets.” He urged people to come forward with any information about people selling similar products. Parents have previously been warned about sweets laced with cannabis after they found their way into the hands of children. Two 13-year-old boys were taken to hospital in Merseyside in July last year after eating sweets, and detectives in Greater Manchester told parents to be on alert during Halloween season trick-or-treating.",News/UK news,Woman dies in east London after eating suspected cannabis sweet ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/04/woman-dies-in-east-london-after-eating-suspected-cannabis-sweet
4/5/2022,"The Senate judiciary committee on Monday neared a vote on the historic nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, poised to be the first Black woman confirmed to the supreme court. Following days of interrogation and debate over Jackson’s qualifications, the committee vote was expected to be evenly split, 11-11. That would force Democrats to “discharge” the nomination, delaying but not denying confirmation. Before the vote could take place, the committee adjourned to await the arrival of its 22nd member, the California Democrat Alex Padilla, whose flight to Washington was delayed. A vote to discharge Jackson’s nomination was expected as early as Monday evening. That would set up hours of additional debate on the Senate floor. Democrats and the White House hope to confirm Jackson to the lifetime position on the court before Congress recesses for the Easter holiday on Friday. The 51-year-old was confirmed by the Senate to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit last year with the support of three Republicans. Only one of those Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, has committed to voting for her again. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has said he will not support Jackson’s nomination to the supreme court​​, calling her an “activist to the core”, outside the judicial mainstream. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has not said how she intends to vote, but is seen as one of only two more Republicans, along with Mitt Romney of Utah, who might support Jackson. If confirmed, Jackson will replace the retiring liberal justice Stephen Breyer, for whom she clerked, and would make history as the first Black woman and only the sixth woman to sit on the court in more than 200 years. Her confirmation would, however, do nothing to change the ideological balance of a court on which conservatives outnumber liberals 6-3. In his opening remarks on Monday, Dick Durbin of Illinois, the committee’s Democratic chair, praised Jackson’s “impeccable qualifications” and said her experience as a public defender would bring a “missing perspective to the court”. “This committee’s action today in nothing less than making history,” Durbin said. “I’m honored to be a part of it. I will strongly and proudly support Judge Jackson’s nomination.” Durbin also lamented Republican hostility toward Jackson, accusing senators of leveraging “vile” and “discredited” attacks on her record and character. “She stayed calm and collected. She showed dignity, grace and poise,” Durbin said. “It is unfortunate that our hearing came to that, but if there is one positive to take away from these attacks, it is that the nation got to see the temperament of a good, strong person truly ready to serve on the highest court in the land.” Many Republicans used the hearing on Monday to rehash their attacks on Jackson, accusing her of handing down lenient sentences to child sex crime offenders when she was a federal trial court judge, a claim independent factcheckers have said is baseless and lacks context. During her hearings, Jackson forcefully defended her record, telling senators these were among the most traumatic and haunting cases she dealt with and that she did her “duty to hold the defendants accountable”. Republicans also sought to portray Jackson as “soft on crime”, a line of attack dismissed outright by the American Bar Association, which testified that she was strongly qualified for the position. Republicans on the committee appear uniformly opposed to Jackson’s nomination, starting with the ranking member, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who announced he would not vote to confirm Jackson because “she and I have fundamental, different views on the role of judges and the role that they should play in our system of government”. On Monday, Graham again used his time to decry Democrats’ treatment of nominees named by Republican presidents. “If we were in charge, she would not have been before this committee,” Graham said. His point was that Republican control of the Senate would have forced Democrats to put forward a more “moderate” – in his view – nominee. But Democrats saw the comment as a plain-spoken acknowledgment of Republicans’ hardball tactics when it comes to the supreme court, after the GOP refused to let Barack Obama fill a vacancy in 2016 – an act without precedent. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, compared proceedings on Jackson’s nomination to Festivus, the holiday celebrated on the TV series, Seinfeld. “There’s been a lot of airing of grievances,” Booker said, adding: “I’ve heard things that are just ridiculous.” During more than 30 hours of hearings last month, Jackson pledged to be an independent justice who would decide cases from a “neutral position”. She defended her record while reflecting on her personal story as the daughter of public school teachers in the segregated south. As the 22-member panel convened on Monday, Joe Biden said Jackson would “bring extraordinary qualifications, deep experience and intellect, and a rigorous judicial record to the supreme court. “She deserves to be confirmed as the next justice.”",News/US news,Senate judiciary committee nears vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/04/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-senate-vote
4/5/2022,"The continued heating of the planet means that this year will probably be one of this century’s coolest. As the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes clear, current climate pledges by governments would not keep global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels – the target promised in the 2015 Paris agreement. Instead greenhouse gas emissions are rising. During the past decade, on average annually they were at their highest levels in human history. The world is on a pathway to temperature increases of more than 3C in the coming decades. This would make large parts of the world too hot to work in. Severe harvest failures will become common. Disappearing ice caps would submerge major cities. Governments have hitherto been far too hesitant to take on vested interests and are all too ready to protect historic investments in fossil fuels. This cannot go on. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, was right to say that the world “was on a fast track to climate disaster”. Nations and corporations, he candidly said, are not just turning a blind eye to a planetary disaster but adding fuel to the flames. There is very little time left to implement policies that promote the needed greener lifestyle choices and cheaper renewable solutions that would generate jobs, energy security and price stability. To achieve 1.5C, the world must reduce annual CO2 emissions by about 50% by 2030, and reach net zero by 2050, while reducing methane emissions a third by 2030 and almost halving them by 2050. This will need deep cuts in fossil fuel use. The IPCC says the case is unanswerable for widespread electrification – especially crucial for enabling the decarbonisation of road transport, industry, mining and manufacturing – powered by renewable sources. The UN’s scientists argue that energy efficiency and conservation are central to achieving a greener, safer future. There are some success stories: at least 18 countries have sustained production-based greenhouse gas and consumption-based carbon dioxide emission reductions for longer than a decade. Much of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere was released by rich countries that burned coal, oil and gas to industrialise more than a century ago. The UN panel said about 40% of emissions since then came from Europe and North America. Only about 12% can be attributed to east Asia, including China. It is in the wealthiest 10% of households, which contribute between a third and 45% of climate-changing fumes, where change will have to happen fastest. There are some quick policy wins. Better crop management has an immediate payback. Solar energy and wind energy improve faster and are adopted quicker than nuclear or carbon capture technologies. Diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy are associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions and are increasingly popular. It is likely that global temperatures will “overshoot” the 1.5C pledged by the Paris agreement. Even under one of the least bad scenarios, the IPCC says that temporarily exceeding this limit by a tiny 0.2C before dropping back down to about 1.4C by the century’s end could still unleash irreversible impacts such as dead coral reefs. The pandemic was an opportunity to make the rapid shift required away from fossil fuels and was missed by most governments. Russia’s immoral war in Ukraine offers another chance for nations concerned about overreliance on hydrocarbons to do the right thing.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the latest IPCC report: a fast track to climate disaster | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-latest-ipcc-report-a-fast-track-to-climate-disaster
4/5/2022,"What now for the European Union’s most challenged and compromised democracy? The scale of Viktor Orbán’s fourth consecutive election victory in Hungary was crushing, comprehensive and unexpected. Faced for the first time with a united opposition alliance that put internal differences aside, predictions of a close race – or at least a competitive one – were confounded. On a high turnout, Mr Orbán’s Fidesz party actually won a greater number of seats than it held previously while Péter Márki-Zay, the opposition’s candidate for prime minister, failed even to win the local constituency he was contesting. Once again, resistance to Mr Orbán’s brand of authoritarian, conservative nationalism was largely confined to Budapest and other urban centres. This is a result that will be mourned in Brussels and celebrated in the Kremlin. After pledging to keep Hungary out of the confrontation between the liberal west and Vladimir Putin’s Russia over Ukraine, Mr Orbán has a mandate to obstruct and disrupt EU attempts to impose further sanctions on Moscow. At a time when European unity is paramount, that is a problem that western leaders can do without. But at a still more fundamental level, the EU faces the acute dilemma of how to deal with a member state in which democratic norms have been flouted to such an extent that Mr Orbán’s autocratic rule appears unassailable. Mr Márki-Zay did not fight a good campaign, as the opposition alliance failed to gel. But as he pointed out in a crestfallen election night address, this was anything but a fair political fight. During the course of 12 years in power, Mr Orbán has dismantled checks and balances to the extent that a proper hearing for opposition voices is now impossible in Hungary. Brazen gerrymandering of electoral districts – and a huge disparity in campaign resources – have grotesquely skewed the political map in favour of Fidesz. In 2018 the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe described the country’s elections as “free but not fair”. Independent media have been forced out of business or taken over by government-friendly buyers, while state media barely go through the motions of presenting a balanced debate. Last month, one state television channel broadcast a 30-minute address by Mr Orbán nine times in the space of 24 hours. By contrast, Mr Márki-Zay was granted a total of five minutes’ airtime on state television during the election campaign. A corrupt clientelism, partly financed through EU funds, has made Mr Orbán’s friends and allies rich and entrenched his oppressive influence across civil society. Confronted with a member state that risks becoming a democracy in name only – and where political opposition from within faces unacceptable obstacles – pressure from without must be more robustly exerted. The EU has frozen Covid recovery fund payments to Hungary, amounting to 5% of GDP, over corruption concerns. In the absence of a genuine commitment to reform in Budapest, that money should not be forthcoming. Brussels should also make it clear to Mr Orbán that a new law tying EU funds to compliance with democratic norms will be rigorously enforced. Belatedly, it must be made clear that a substantial price will be paid for treating the basic principles of EU membership with contempt. After the polls closed, Mr Orbán exulted at a win “so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels”. The EU should not allow him the last word.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Hungary’s election: a dismal day for democracy | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-hungarys-election-a-dismal-day-for-democracy
