2/2/2022,"Eric Smith, who served 27 years in prison for the 1993 murder of a 4-year-old Steuben County child when he was only 13, is a free man. Smith, who was granted parole following his 11th hearing in October, was released Tuesday from the Woodbourne Correctional Facility, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Smith will live in Queens County, according to an agency spokesperson. Smith was 13 when he was accused of killing Derrick Robie in August 1993 in the Village of Savona. Smith lured Robie into a wooded area near the boy's home. Derrick was walking alone to a summer camp at a nearby park at the time. Smith strangled Derrick, smashed his head with a rock, and sexually abused him. Smith was taken into custody about a week later, and the case received national attention due to the nature of the crime. He was tried as an adult and convicted of second-degree murder following a trial in Steuben County Court. Smith, who is now 41, was sentenced to nine years to life in prison and first became eligible for parole in 2002. Smith was housed in a juvenile facility until 2001, when he was transferred to state prison.

Derrick's parents, Dale and Doreen Robie, opposed Smith's release every time he came up for parole, and also used their son's murder to push for stricter limits on parole hearings — including requiring felony offenders to wait five years, rather than the current two, between hearings. Under the conditions of his parole, Smith can't leave New York state without permission, must have regular contact with his parole officer, cannot possess any firearms or other deadly weapons, and can't associate with others who are known to be engaged in illegal activity, among other restrictions.

 A Georgia sheriff announced on Monday that he will offer $500,000 of his own money to anyone who has information regarding the case of Georgia teen Kendrick Johnson, who was found in a rolled-up gym mat in 2013, just days after closing the investigation into his death. Lowndes County Sheriff Ashley Paulk announced Thursday that Johnson's case would be closed and no charges would be filed with the release of a 16-page document detailing the investigation. Johnson's family pushed back on the findings, saying that they believe the death of the 17-year-old was covered up. ""After the release of my synopsis of the Federal files on the Kendrick Johnson case, his parents have called me a liar and continue to state that Kendrick was murdered,"" Paulk said in a news release, according to NBC News. ""Because of these statements, I am personally - with my own funds - offering a reward of one-half million dollars ($500,000.00) to anyone who comes forward with information that results in the arrest and conviction of a person for the alleged murder of Kendrick Johnson at Lowndes High School,"" he reportedly added. Johnson's body was discovered in January 2013 rolled up in a wrestling mat in the high school's gym. A police report at the time said his body was positioned head down with his feet visible at the top of the mat, which was standing vertically, NBC News reported. Local investigators said that Johnson died after trying to retrieve his shoes from inside the mat, ruling his death accidental asphyxiation. On Tuesday, Paulk said that Johnson's tragic death was a ""weird accident"" and that he and two other detectives spent a year analyzing 17 boxes of files on the case before releasing the report last week. He added that the reward he is offering is ""one last avenue"" for the sheriff's office to obtain information it previously may not have had. ""I'm willing to put up those funds to see if anybody comes forward with anything viable that might have been missed,"" Paulk told NBC News on Tuesday. ""I don't really feel like there's anybody out there with knowledge and from what I've seen - I studied all the camera angles and everything else - it was a tragic accident. But if somebody comes in with a different view we're going to listen to them.""",U.S./The Hill,Sheriff offers $500K of his own money for information after closing case of teen found in gym mat,https://news.yahoo.com/sheriff-offers-500k-own-money-183027770.html
2/2/2022,"The latest Operation Hammer Strike update from sheriff’s officials revealed the recent eradication of hundreds of marijuana greenhouses in San Bernardino County. The outdoor marijuana cultivations — many operated by suspects in the High Desert, Los Angeles County, and China — were shuttered during OHS Week 22, a seven-day period, which ended Sunday, the SBC Sheriff’s Department said Monday. During that week, a total of 256 greenhouses were found and eradicated by investigators, who mitigated one electrical bypass and one THC extraction lab, according to sheriff’s officials. Sheriff's personnel also arrested 36 suspects, with investigators seizing 52,715 marijuana plants, more than 3,575 pounds of processed marijuana, more than $51,000 in cash, and 10 guns, a sheriff’s report said. Investigators from the Sheriff's Department - Marijuana Enforcement Team, along with SBC deputies from several sheriff's patrol stations, served 17 search warrants at various locations in Adelanto, Apple Valley, Hesperia, Hinkley, Wonder Valley, Twentynine Palms, El Mirage, Walnut, West Covina, Alhambra, and Chino Hills. The strike was launched after MET personnel received numerous complaints about large outdoor and indoor marijuana cultivations in these areas: 14000 Block of Lakota Road, Apple Valley 15400 Block of Riverside, Hesperia 39600 Block of Summerset, Hinkley 42100 Block of Friends Drive, Hinkley 42700 Block of Hinkley Road, Hinkley 4300 Block of Bagdad Highway, Twentynine Palms 83400 Block of Amboy Road, Wonder Valley 1900 Block of Slate Creek Drive, Walnut 600 Block of Butterfield, West Covina 2000 Block of Elm Street, Alhambra 1900 Block of Deer Haven, Chino Hills Several parcels with no address in Adelanto, Hinkley, El Mirage, and Wonder Valley. Suspects were cited or booked on suspicion of cultivation of cannabis, over six plants; possession for sales of marijuana, illegal water discharge, manufacturing a controlled substance, utility theft, and conspiracy. The investigations revealed the cannabis cultivations were not in compliance with California's Medical and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act and SBC’s ordinance prohibiting commercial cannabis activity, including growing marijuana plants outdoors. The sheriff's Gangs/Narcotics Division will continue to enforce the state’s cannabis laws and the county's ordinance regarding cannabis cultivation and distribution. Persons found guilty of violating the state law and county ordinance are subject to fines, prosecution, and seizure of property, sheriff’s officials said. Property owners who are growing marijuana or are aware their tenants are growing marijuana on their properties in violation of the state law and local ordinances may also be subject to civil or criminal sanctions. Property owners are encouraged to contact local law enforcement or code compliance agencies to confirm if cultivating cannabis is prohibited or allowed under specific regulations. Anyone with information about the ongoing investigation is asked by the sheriff's department to contact the Sheriff's Gangs/Narcotics Division at (909) 387-8400 or NARC-MET@sbcsd.org.

2/2/2022,"By Jeff Mason and Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON (Reuters) -White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday rejected concerns that Sarah Bloom Raskin would be unable to maintain independence at the Federal Reserve given that her husband led impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump. Raskin, U.S. President Joe Biden's nominee as the Fed's vice chair for supervision, should be judged on her ""impeccable credentials"" and not her marriage to Representative Jamie Raskin, who served as the lead Democratic prosecutor for the unsuccessful 2021 impeachment trial, Psaki told reporters. ""I think she can stand on her own qualifications, not just because she's a woman, but because she's done a lot in her career,"" Psaki said. ""She has been said by many to be the most qualified person to be nominated to this role, which I think is probably more important than who she's married to."" Raskin, a former Fed governor and senior Treasury Department official who is strongly backed by progressive Democrats, has become a lightning rod for criticism from business groups and fiscal conservatives for her views on climate change. Psaki told reporters Raskin had pledged her commitment to the independent role of the Federal Reserve and would work with her colleagues to mitigate a range of risks, if confirmed. ""Just like any nominee, she should be judged by qualifications,"" Psaki said. ""Her experience and her impeccable credentials were the determinant in her being nominated for this role, and I think it's a little questionable for anyone to raise otherwise."" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week sent an unprecedented letter to lawmakers https://www.reuters.com/business/us-chamber-issues-rare-warning-fed-nominee-raskin-citing-oil-gas-views-2022-01-28 raising concerns about Raskin and her calls for federal regulators to transition financing away from the fossil fuel industry. On Monday, 24 members of the fiscally conservative State Financial Officers Foundation, representing 21 states, urged Biden to withdraw Raskin's nomination, warning that what they called her ""radical banking and economic views"" could shut oil and gas companies out of bank loans and send energy costs sharply higher. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown last week said he met with Raskin and Biden's nominees for two other Fed jobs, and said there was no question that they were qualified. Administration officials say Raskin's views on climate change are in line with public comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. But the top Republican on the panel, Pat Toomey, has blasted Raskin for what he called ""demonstrated hostility"" toward the oil and gas sector. The committee, which must approve the Fed nominees before they are considered by the full Senate, will hold a confirmation hearing on Thursday for Raskin and two Black economists nominated for the board, Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson.
