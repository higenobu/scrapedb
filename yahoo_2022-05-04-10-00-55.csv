5/4/2022,"Healthcare ranks as one of the most pressing concerns for retirees, and with medical expenses rising every year, two out of three Americans worry about high healthcare costs in retirement. Models estimate that a retired couple at age 65 will need roughly $200,000 saved for healthcare alone–exceeding the average American's total savings. As part of its annual inflation adjustments, the IRS has recently released new contribution limits for health savings accounts, giving retirement savers more power to save for these increasing medical costs. HSAs are generally viewed as a way to save for health expenses, but they can also serve as powerful tools for retirement. Now you can save even more. A financial advisor could help you plan for retirement and determine how an HSA could help with your financial goals. Speak to a qualified advisor today. IRS Increases HSA Contribution Limits for 2023 High inflation and rising healthcare costs combine to create an ever-increasing burden on retirees. As part of its annual adjustments, the IRS has released its 2023 inflation-adjusted contribution limits for health savings accounts (HSAs). Starting next year, individuals with a high-deductible self-only health plan can contribute an extra $200 to their HSA. The new limit will increase from $3,650 to $3,850. High-deductible health plans are health plans with an annual deductible that exceeds $1,500 for self-only coverage, or $3,000 for families. These are often paired with an HSA, which allows you to use pre-tax dollars to pay for qualified medical expenses. How Retirement Savers Can Take Advantage Many people primarily consider HSAs as a way to save for health expenses, similar to using a flexible spending account (FSA) for lower-deductible plans. However, HSAs are often a powerful yet underutilized savings tool that extends tax benefits far into retirement. HSA contributions are not subject to federal income taxes, so deducting your contributions from your salary can reduce your annual tax burden. You can continue to contribute until you enroll in Medicare. Furthermore, HSA contributions earn interest free of taxes. Those funds can be invested, as well, and just like with an employer-sponsored retirement plan, your investments grow tax free. As such, unlike an FSA, the funds do not expire at the end of the year; the balance rolls over from year to year and the balance is always yours to spend, save or invest. Lastly, at age 65, you have free access to your HSA funds for any purpose. There are no required minimum distributions and money taken out for eligible health expenses is not subject to federal income tax. If you do choose to withdraw funds in retirement, you will pay income taxes just like you would with other retirement plans. Bottom Line The IRS recently released updated HSA contribution limits for 2023, adjusting annually for inflation. Starting next year, individuals can contribute up to $3,850 a year in tax-deferred dollars. HSAs are powerful retirement tools that are often underutilized, despite their tax advantages and growing concern for rising healthcare costs. You can qualify for an HSA so long as you are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, and you may port your account if you change jobs because the account always belongs to you, not your employer. HSAs are best suited for retirement investment savings, but this may mean that you will pay out-of-pocket for medical expenses while contributing to one. If in doubt, an expert can help you determine if an HSA is a good choice for you. Retirement Planning Tips Not sure if choosing a high-deductible health plan with an HSA will help you in retirement?

5/4/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A lot is riding on how Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell parries a question he’ll surely be asked after Wednesday’s monetary policy decision: is a 75-basis-point rate hike in the cards at some stage? Most Read from Bloomberg Citi Trader Made Error Behind Flash Crash in Europe Stocks Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Selling Billions Alibaba Recovers After Report on ‘Ma’ Briefly Erased $26 Billion Ukraine Latest: Johnson to Evoke Wartime History in Speech Ukraine Latest: Kremlin Says Putin and Macron Discussed Mariupol The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points at this meeting, something it hasn’t done since May 2000. And half-point moves are fully priced in by swaps traders for each of the following three meetings -- June, July and September -- the most aggressive trajectory in three decades. But there might still be room for even more hawkishness, depending on how Powell navigates his upcoming press conference. Traders will be watching closely to see if the Fed boss green-lights -- or at the very least opts not to red-light -- the idea of a three-quarter point hike, something the central bank hasn’t implemented since the annus horribilis for Treasuries that was 1994. Either way, the shifts in the rates market -- which at one point last week had a 75-basis point move for June close to being a coin toss -- could be swift and merciless. “Powell will fall back to ‘we are not on pre-set rate hikes’ or something along those lines -- ‘we go in with an open mind each meeting and will talk it over and we’ll see where we go from there,’” said Tony Farren, managing director at Mischler Financial Group. “The market would take that as hawkish. For his comments to seem dovish, he’d have to shut down the talk of 75 basis points. And while I don’t think he’ll endorse it, I don’t think he’ll shut it down.” Increasingly hawkish rhetoric from Fed officials and signs that inflation may remain elevated for much of the year have already driven significant changes, with traders wagering that the fed funds rate will end this year more than 2.5 percentage points above its current level. An ambivalent tone from the chairman on Wednesday could push Treasury yields up across the curve, Farren said. Powell is likely to stick to his plan of being data dependent and non-committal about future rate increases, Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, calling the current market pricing for a 75 basis-point hike in June “notable odds.” St. Louis Fed president James Bullard has already openly articulated a case for a potential 75 basis-point hike this year. Other senior Fed officials have said that a 50 basis-point hike is more appropriate alongside plans to allow the central bank’s balance sheet to start contracting by as much as $95 billion a month. “I think a 75-basis-point hike is a bridge too far for this committee which is still made up by a bunch of doves,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “And the 50 basis points of hikes for four meetings in a row is hawkish enough, in the eyes of the market” as well. So far this week, traders have trimmed the odds of a precipitous June hike, with swap contracts for June back at 109 basis points more than the current rate from a recent peak of 111 basis points. That suggests around a one-in-three chance a 75 basis-point hike next month following the 50-basis-point that is widely tipped to be implemented this Wednesday instead of just a half-point bump for June. The market’s preemptive pricing of a possibly more aggressive rate cycle reflects how the Fed has been forced to up its hawkish mantra all year as inflation expectations have marched higher, particularly after the commodity-price surge sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “If anything can be said about Powell’s Fed during the last six months it is that there is a clear bias to surprise on the hawkish side,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.
