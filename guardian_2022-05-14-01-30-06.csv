5/14/2022,"The call came at about midday on Wednesday. There had been “chemical poisoning” after a blast and patients needed collecting. Fears of a Russian chemical weapons attack have haunted Ukraine almost since the war began, and as the volunteer medics in Sloviansk pulled on the ageing gas masks and plastic overalls that were their only protection, they wondered if this was it. They set off anyway, inured to personal risks after weeks of driving through shelling to patch up the men and women injured on one of the most intensely fought-over sections of the frontline. “We got a call saying there was a yellow-brown cloud after the hit and yellow-white flakes in the air like snow. The soldiers immediately started having breathing problems,” said Vit, a paramedic who asked to go only by his nickname, which refers to his peacetime role as mayor of a small town. He was worried about being captured and tortured by Russian troops who were just a few miles away. The ambulance team listened to the warning and then went to get the choking soldiers. Like the troops they support, they are supplementing limited, outdated equipment with courage and determination. After dropping off their patient, who had gone into spasms in the ambulance, they were told the gas came not from chemical weapons but from a chemical plant that had been hit by Russian munitions. But if the fear of one particular horror was put on hold for a moment, the other terrors of this war are drawing closer to this city in Donbas, less than 20 miles behind the frontline. “You can win one battle then the next day there are more troops, sent back to the same place,” said Vlad, a veteran who signed up to fight again after the February invasion, and now a patient in a Sloviansk clinic. He asked not to give his last name because his family were in areas occupied by Russian troops and he feared they could face reprisals. His cheek shook when he talked about his children, and his fight was personal as well as patriotic. This corner of Luhansk and Donetsk region is one of the few areas where Moscow’s army is still consistently gaining ground, even if their advance proceeds at a snail’s pace and recent attempts to bridge a strategically important river ended in a rout. Ukraine has followed its victory in Kyiv by pushing Russian artillery back from within firing range of the country’s second largest city, Kharkiv. A senior general said this week that Moscow’s troops had been put on the defensive on several other key fronts, including along the Black Sea coast, and ministers have started talking about an offensive to take back territory lost in 2014. But on the rolling steppe here, geography denies the Ukrainian military some of the advantages that allowed its forces to humble Moscow’s troops around the capital. Soldiers rarely get close enough to fight face to face or deploy the western anti-tank missiles that helped them save Kyiv. Instead, their artillery guns face off across vast open fields, dug in with mazes of trenches that could have come from the last century, pounding each other with shells while jets occasionally scream overhead. Many Russian guns shoot further than the ones Ukraine’s military had at the start of the war, so while they wait for western weapons with a longer range – such as the M777 howitzers dispatched by the US and just starting to arrive at the frontline – they must live under constant bombardment. “Positions where the Ukrainian army are staying are bombed with artillery, missiles and by air constantly, every day, so it gets to the point where there is nothing to hold on to in these points, that is part of the problem,” said Serhiy Haidai, the head of the military administration for the Luhansk region. “The attacks with tanks we fight off, but we have no possibility to counter the artillery. That’s why unfortunately we have to retreat. We have been holding for three months already, and Russians couldn’t get through this small area. I hope the Ukrainian army will still hold these positions and – with the weapons we are waiting for – can even go into counterattack.” After the humiliation of defeat near Kyiv, Vladimir Putin doubled down instead on the battle for the eastern Donbas region, where proxy forces have held ground seized in 2014 for eight years, claiming “independence” from Kyiv that provided a pretext for the wider invasion. The ruthless bombardment they unleashed in pursuit of this goal shows in the type and scale of the injuries treated at the Sloviansk clinic, said Svitlana Druzenko, a paediatric trauma specialist and director of the all-volunteer Priogov mobile hospital, which treated the chemical poisoning victims. She spent the first month of the war evacuating injured people from near frontlines in the capital. “In Kyiv and the Kyiv region we didn’t see such a large amount of wounded soldiers as here,” she said. “Here we also see a lot more severe injuries: torn-off arms and legs, or we must do an amputation, and we get a lot of head trauma. The main injuries here are from blasts. Near Kyiv we also saw more gunshot wounds.” Every day they collect casualties from the frontlines, or civilians from bombed-out homes, and stabilise them and send them on to safer hospitals. They know they are targets, because the Ukrainian government says more than 500 healthcare centres have been hit. Their ambulances have been shelled – they are fundraising for armoured vehicles – they have been tracked by Russian jets, and the towns where they are based have been hit repeatedly. Some of the western weapons that Ukraine hopes will change the course of the war have started arriving on the battlefield, including M777 guns, stingers and more anti-tank Javelins, Haidai said. The head of a national guard unit that helps to protect the medics this week showed off the remains of a Russian Orlan drone that he was sending to Kyiv for analysis. His fighters had shot down the aircraft, which costs about $100,000, with a US stinger missile, he said. The weapons influx was still not enough, Haidai said, but he hoped the shipments would speed up and he took heart from the Ukrainian military’s continued skill in outmanoeuvring Russia when artillery was not holding troops back. In the last week Russia had twice tried to build a pontoon bridge to bring tanks and weapons round for the siege of Severodonetsk. It was bombed the first time by Ukraine, leading to a large loss of weapons and lives, and then Russian engineers started again in the same place. “What’s interesting about this bridge is the Russian tactics: they built it, tried to bring over the weapons, we got them, and they built it again and we got them again,” he said. “It shows they are trying to win not with military intelligence but with sheer force of numbers.”",News/World news,"In ageing gas masks, medics in Ukraine rush towards choking troops",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/gas-masks-medics-ukraine-choking-troops-sloviansk
5/14/2022,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has told Boris Johnson that for four years she lived in the shadow of his mistaken statement as foreign secretary that she had been in Iran to train journalists. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, released by Iran just over a month ago, told Johnson in a face-to-face meeting in Downing Street that his remarks had had a big impact on her life, according to Tulip Siddiq, her MP and close ally. Speaking outside Downing Street after the meeting, Siddiq said Johnson looked visibly shocked, but added that she was proud of Zaghari-Ratcliffe for being so blunt. Johnson, giving evidence to the foreign affairs select committee in 2017, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Tehran to train journalists when she had travelled to Iran to see her parents with her child Gabriella. Johnson’s remarks, which he later clarified, were seized upon by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, but were not cited when they took a second case against her last year after she had served her initial five-year sentence. Siddiq said: “Nazanin was sitting next to the prime minister and told him very clearly and categorically that his words had a big impact on her and that she lived in the shadow of his words for the best part of four-and-a-half years, and I have to say the prime minister looked quite shocked I think when she said that. “I was really proud she said that to him because she wanted to make it clear she is happy now, is grateful and appreciates the fact that she is home now but there was a time when those words had a big impact.” According to Richard Ratcliffe, Nazanin’s husband, Johnson offered no apology for his personal handling of the case or any view that the Foreign Office could have done more to secure earlier release. She was held in Iran for six years, and released only after the UK government finally paid an acknowledged £400m debt to Iran, a debt that the UK had previously either contested or said could not be paid due to sanctions on Iran. Ministers had always denied there was a link between the debt and her detention. In the end the debt was paid to Iran via a bank in Oman on the strict condition that the money was used only for humanitarian purposes. It is not clear how that agreement is policed. Ratcliffe stressed it was not an “abrasive meeting” and that it was “undeniable” that Johnson was sorry for the impact his mistake had had, having publicly said he was sorry “if I inadvertently caused any further anguish”. Ratcliffe said lessons needed to be learned from the mistakes by the UK government in handling the case, an issue that is expected to be picked up when the foreign affairs select committee starts an inquiry into Iranian state hostage-taking. The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and the Middle East minister Alistair Burt, both advocates of paying the debt, are due to give evidence. Zaghari-Ratcliffe suggested the prime minister could also give evidence, something he said he would consider. The delegation to Downing Street made a point of raising the case of Morad Tahbaz, a British-Iranian-American trinational who has been left in Tehran, and not put on a form of parole as previously expected. Ratcliffe said: “I am lighter, and fatter and happier and life is picking up, but there are others left in harm’s way. There are two new French people picked up this week and a Swedish guy on death row. When they are threatening to execute someone, that is a real red line and a warning signal. If they are willing to kill one person, no one is safe”. No 10 said: “I think it is important to remember that it was the Iranian government who were responsible for her unfair detention, and the decision to release her was always in their gift. However, I would point back to the prime minister’s words, his answers to questions on this before and he has previously apologised for his comments in 2017.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe, still recovering from her ordeal, opted to say nothing after the meeting, but stood alongside her daughter, Gabriella.",News/News,Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe tells PM she ‘lived in the shadow’ of his mistake,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/13/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-tells-boris-johnson-she-lived-in-the-shadow-of-his-mistake
5/14/2022,"The hit Colombian singer J Balvin had to abandon recording sessions and filming in London with Ed Sheeran last month because his visa never arrived. The reggaeton star, who has sold 35m records worldwide, is the latest musician to be caught out by long delays at UK visas and immigration. Agents and tour managers are having to cancel British performances because visas for performers that used to be turned around within a fortnight are now taking up to two months. Balvin applied in March for a visa as he was meant to be in Britain from 3 to 8 April, for recording sessions with Sheeran at Abbey Road and a video shoot. When the visa had still not arrived by 12 April, he withdrew the application. Balvin has been waiting a fortnight for a new visa to try again to shoot a video with Sheeran. He is also hoping to perform in the UK. It has not been possible to pay for priority fast-tracking of visas since March, according to those working in the industry. It is understood to be because of a chronic backlog made worse by an influx of Ukrainian applications. Balvin, whose full name is José Álvaro Osorio Balvín, has already collaborated with Sheeran. Their joint EP with songs Forever My Love and Sigue was released in March. Steve Richard, director of T&S Immigration Services, who has been working on Balvin’s application, said: “We’ve explained to the management company that the visa system is essentially in crisis and it’s mainly because of the Ukraine situation. “It’s been going on for a while now and you would have hoped that it would have been getting there, but it’s just slipping and slipping. We haven’t heard of anybody getting a visa in less than six weeks in quite a while now.” Richard added: “It’s taking artists by surprise – they’re not used to waiting over six weeks for visas and they are being caught out. I can see visa-heavy festivals – those which feature many acts from Africa and Asia, for instance – being impacted worst by this, unless the UKVI [UK Visas and Immigration] is able to throw more staff at the visa section.” While international musicians from places such as the US or the EU only require work permits, performers from many Asian, South American and African countries need visas. The Congolese band Fulu Miziki Kollektiv, who perform using instruments made from rubbish, are meant to be starting a UK tour next week. They applied for visas on 7 April and with no news they are wondering if they will have to cancel performances. Deboul, a singer in the band, said: “This is all our dreams being taken away, everything we’ve worked for. We always dream of being able to have a stage, to share our message, but for some reason, we still can’t get that, just because there are these visa issues. “It somehow feels like there’s a world they don’t want us to be part of, even if we have what it takes, we are invited to play, we have everything they ask for, and we still don’t have any answer.” Circus Raj, a group of five circus performers, and the Rajasthan Heritage Brass Band were supposed to arrive from Jaipur last Thursday to begin a tour of British festivals. Music agent Graham Breakwell applied for their visas at the start of March but only one dancer and a fakir from the circus was given a visa and only two of the six brass band members. Their first performance is due on Saturday in the Coventry city of culture finale celebrations. “We’ve got one tuba player and one clarinettist,” Breakwell said. “It’s crazy, you can’t work with that.” For the Coventry performances, he has made up the brass band with performers from Bradford and the circus act will be missing slack rope walking, acrobats and contortionists. Both acts are due to perform at Glastonbury next month and Breakwell is concerned. “We will have to cancel shows if we still haven’t received their visas. The knock-on effects are clearly very serious for everyone in the industry.” The Home Office has been contacted for comment.",News/UK news,UK visa delays cause J Balvin to cancel Ed Sheeran sessions,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/j-balvin-uk-visa-delays-backlog-cancel-ed-sheeran-sessions
5/14/2022,"A shortage of chlorine is forcing some public swimming pools to close, with operators blaming factors ranging from a production fall in China to Brexit and the war in Ukraine. Saxon Pool in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, has been closed to general swimmers since 6 May, with the operator and Central Bedfordshire council cancelling almost all sessions, apart from swimming lessons and a swimathon event. Users were informed via email: “Unfortunately, due to a nationwide issue, SLL have been unable to secure orders of pool chemicals from Europe which is essential to operate the pool fully.” According to its website, most users will be unable to swim until more chemicals arrive. The council said deliveries were expected next week. Runnymede Leisure Centre in Benfleet had to close its pool one weekend in April after running out of melclorite, a type of chlorine, which it reportedly obtained from manufacturers in Ukraine. At the University of East Anglia, the pool closed for five days, with managers citing “severely depleted” levels of chlorine gas in the UK. It reopened on 10 May after a delivery, announcing the good news to users by tweeting: “Swimming is back.” Industry experts have pointed to a variety of reasons for the supply disruptions. “Some pool chemical companies are experiencing supply chain difficulties,” said Chris Hayes, managing director for the UK’s Swimming Pool and Allied Trades Association. “These can be attributed to a number of issues, including a temporarily reduced supply in the UK, a backlog coming from China’s supply chain caused by Covid, a significant fire in a US chemical plant in late 2020 and worldwide transportation issues. We are aware that some public pools have needed to close temporarily, and chemical suppliers will be working with these leisure facilities to look at other appropriate pool chemicals that can be used.” The Pool Water Treatment Advisory Group (PWTAG), a UK-based independent membership organisation, said there was a national shortage of calcium hypochlorite, a solid form of chlorine. This has driven up prices by 50% to 60%. Janice Calvert, the group’s chair, said manufacturing in China had declined, particularly in the run-up to the winter Olympics, because Beijing has been tightening up on environmental pollution and closing down factories that were non-compliant. She added there was a problem shipping chemicals from China to the UK, with the only route now being via Antwerp. Moreover, INEOS, the main manufacturer of sodium hypochlorite (a liquid form of chloride) in the UK, shut down its plant for May and part of June. As a result of Brexit, chlorine manufacturers have to obtain separate regulatory approval for their products in the UK as well as the EU, at an initial cost of £100,000 per product, but approvals only last 10 years, in a relatively small market. This has led some suppliers to buy from others that have approval, which means there are only two main suppliers left in the UK, said PWTAG. The Chemical Business Association said: “The horrific situation in Ukraine has wrought further havoc on an already heavily disrupted chemical supply chain caused by factors such as Covid, Brexit or driver shortages.”",News/UK news,Some UK public swimming pools forced to close over national chlorine shortage,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/some-uk-public-swimming-pools-forced-to-close-over-national-chlorine-shortage
5/14/2022,"In 1975, a 549-page book was published in translation by the Italian publisher Einaudi. Its original English title was Politics and Society in Post-War Naples; it came with a distinctive orange cover, and its author was a British academic from the University of Reading called Percy Allum. The book caused a sensation in Italy. A rigorous analysis of the way politics and society worked in Naples, it was written with verve, panache and crystal clarity. Most incredibly of all, it named names. Allum’s analysis of the political power structures used by the Christian Democracy party and other groupings in that southern city, and particularly what he called the “clan” around the Gava family, and the “bosses” Silvio and Antonio Gava, sent shock waves through Naples and its political establishment. Allum, who has died aged 88, showed with meticulous care how voting and power were organised and how clientelist structures, which were connected to the political culture of the city, worked – street by street, committee by committee, ballot paper by ballot paper. It was obvious to all that the Italian edition of Politics and Society would be controversial, so the translation was carefully monitored, and there were fears that the Gavas would sue on publication, which they never did. Allum’s book made him a household name in Naples, and attracted the ire of Antonio Gava himself, who would denigrate the British academic in interviews and react with irritation whenever the book was mentioned for the rest of his long political career. How had Allum come to write such an extraordinary book, with its quotes from Mao and Stendhal, and its ironic use of proverbs, as well as sociological theory, history, political analysis and anthropology? Born in Thame, in rural Oxfordshire, one of six children of Doris (nee Clark) and Robert Allum, he adopted the name Percy (instead of his given name, Perry) at an early age. He went to the Downs school in Colwall in the Malvern hills, where he first became inspired to draw thanks to an art teacher called Maurice Feild. He would draw and paint for the rest of his life, exhibiting his work in France, Italy and the UK in later years. To celebrate the new year, Percy would send his friends hand-drawn cards. Winning a scholarship to Cambridge, he studied law and history there after military service, and also took a further law degree. His parents had wanted him to go into the family business (a laundry based in Thame) but a teacher had noted his potential and insisted he continue his studies. His PhD in Oxford with the Italian historian Christopher Seton-Watson was a crucial moment, and formed the basis for his Naples book. Allum had already spent time in Naples, learning Italian while living in the city as an English language assistant in the 1950s. In 1957, he met his future wife, Marie-Pierrette Desmas, in France. They married in 1961. Allum’s working life encompassed a number of institutions and universities. He taught at Manchester, and from 1966 at Reading (where he never played the academic game, leading to huge delays in his promotion to professor, which came in 1994), but also in Padua and Naples, in Paris and in Sudan. He was well read and always bang up to date on Italian and European politics, which fed into his teaching and further studies. His magisterial comparative textbook, Democrazia Reale, was written in Italian in 1991 (based on lectures he gave in Padua) and then published in English as State and Society in Western Europe. Once again, the clarity of his writing was able to combine high-level analysis, stories, an eclectic body of sources, ideas and passionate political positions, and deep and concrete research. He was a man of the left, and often spoke out in favour of ethical positions in public life. In Reading he was part of a rich group of Italianists who flourished there in the 1960s, 70s and 80s in the history, Italian and politics departments – such as Stuart Woolf, Paul Corner and Christopher Duggan. Later, he dedicated years to another deep study of Christian Democrat power and culture, this time in the north of Italy, around Vicenza. This work was published in a series of articles and edited books, often in collaboration with local scholars. The great Italian novelist Luigi Meneghello was a key figure in the rise of Italian studies in Reading, and he wrote a beautiful portrait of Allum (Percy Agonistes) in his festschrift. Meneghello underlined Allum’s “torrential” way of speaking, as he threw out references, his long, blond hair flapping around his head, and his intense ability to debate and discuss up-to-date but also historical issues. With the support of Marie-Pierrette, whose dedication to her husband and their two children allowed him to write and travel widely, and spend time in archives and libraries, the Allums moved between France, Italy and the UK. After his early retirement from Reading in 1995, Allum was appointed to a chair in the Università Degli Studi di Napoli “L’Orientale” in Naples, where he taught and researched for a further 10 years. This was a tumultuous time in Italian politics, and Allum was at the heart of debates and political issues, writing frequently and directly in Italian for the Italian dailies La Repubblica and l’Unità, as well as speaking at numerous conferences and congresses. His work had a deep influence on key figures in Neapolitan and national politics and society, for example, the one-time mayor of Naples, Maurizio Valenzi, the Italian president (and communist) Giorgio Napolitano and a whole generation of magistrates and judges who, thanks to Allum’s original writings on Naples, were able to engage in epic battles against the influence of the Neapolitan version of the mafia – the Camorra – in the 1980s, 90s and 2000s. In later years, on retirement from Naples, Allum continued to draw and exhibit his work, which ranged from innovative cityscapes to intimate portraits and self-portraits. He suffered from dementia in the final period of his life. He is survived by Marie-Pierrette, their son, Fabrice, and daughter, Felia, and two granddaughters, and by four sisters.

5/14/2022,"Stephanie Kinnear, 34, who works in marketing, lives in a rented two-bedroom flat in Walthamstow, east London, with her husband, Andy, 35. “Our little flat has two bedrooms – one where we sleep and the other that we always just used for storage, and then as Andy’s office when he worked from home,” says Stephanie. “It had a desk for him and two wardrobes where we stashed everything we couldn’t fit anywhere else. Other than that, there were piles of books and boxes. To call it a home office would be being kind – it was basically a junk room.” The decor wasn’t particularly inspiring either. “The previous tenants had painted a large grey square on to the bland pale walls to create a headboard effect, which looked weird without a bed there. “The thin white curtains were draughty and didn’t block out any light; we’d built a wooden window seat but hadn’t found cushions for it; and as the room was an awkward, small L-shape, whatever furniture we put in there never seemed to quite fit.” While the couple had vague plans to try to improve the room, their busy lives meant it wasn’t a pressing issue – until Stephanie became pregnant, and their priorities changed overnight. “It’s our first baby after a long period of trying,” she says. “While it’s exciting, it’s also nerve-racking, particularly when you’re completely unprepared in terms of what a child would need to be comfortable and safe.” Stephanie and Andy wanted to transform the spare room into a dedicated nursery but, with limited space and Andy’s demanding NHS job to contend with, they were stumped – and stressed – as they tried to work out how to go about it. “Andy works in clinical admin and his workload is more complicated than it was before the pandemic, so we’ll both need our sleep after the baby arrives. Whoever’s doing the night feeds can’t be up and down in our own tiny bedroom – we realised it would be better to have a calm spot elsewhere. “And on days when Andy’s working from home, he and the baby can’t realistically be in the same room. We knew we had to reconfigure the flat so that Andy could work in the living room, but we had no idea where to start or if it was even possible to fit everything for the baby into the spare room. It was a huge worry at what was already an anxious time.” It was a worry that was solved when IKEA stepped in. IKEA believes that every home should be a sanctuary. To achieve this, it has identified three elements that need to come together: function – the room must work as you need it to; space – even a small, awkward-shaped room can feel more spacious if designed well; and emotional stability – the room should make you feel happy and calm. However, according to IKEA’s 2021 Life at Home report, less than half of us say our homes meet our needs – and this can result in stress and frustration. With their lives about to change dramatically, far from making them feel emotionally stable, Stephanie and Andy’s cluttered and unwelcoming spare room was having the opposite effect. So, IKEA stepped in to help them create the sanctuary their growing family needs. “When you’re planning a room for a baby, safety tops the list, followed by accessibility – whether you can reach everything you need to – and a layout that makes tasks such as feeding or nappy changing both easy and comfortable,” says IKEA designer Clotilde Passalacqua, part of a team that has taken on three makeovers for the Guardian over the past few months, to show how clever changes can transform the way our rooms function and feel. “We started with the cot,” says Clotilde. “It can’t go under a window because of draughts; or against a hot radiator, so we put it in the centre of the room, away from the wall. We chose the Myllra cot, which will grow with the baby as the mattress height is adjustable. In the early months, it can be used on its highest setting; then lowered as the baby learns to stand. When he or she is too old for a cot, the side can be removed and a bed guard – currently stored on hooks on the wall – can be put in place, transforming it into a toddler bed. The storage drawer underneath can hold spare clothes and bedding.” The changing station was futureproofed, too. “New parents don’t want to be buying new furniture after only a year or two, so the Myllra changing table is a great idea – it offers plenty of storage, and transforms into a chest of drawers once the baby is out of nappies. We used Stuk divider boxes in the drawers – it’s amazing how much more you can fit inside a drawer when it’s properly organised.” To create a dedicated feeding area, a dusky pink Vedbo armchair was placed in one corner. “The high back and arms provide support, and we hung a couple of cloud-shaped Upplyst LED lights on the wall, so that whoever is giving a feed can do so in a gentle, low light, rather than waking themselves or the baby up too much,” says Clotilde. While feeding, it can be hard for a parent to move far, so the team came up with a clever solution – a Råskog trolley. “Stephanie and Andy can store all the bits and bobs in here, such as bottles and muslins, and anything else they might want. As it’s on wheels, they can pull it next to them; then push it to the side of the room when it’s not in use.” After the baby arrives, the couple will still need to keep their clothes and belongings in the two wardrobes that were already in the room; so, to provide storage for baby items, the IKEA team mounted two slim cabinets on the wall, with a Trofast storage unit below. “The colourful plastic drawers are perfect for little hands, so the baby can help to tidy away their own toys as they get older,” says Clotilde. “We also mounted four Bekvam spice racks on the wall as bookshelves – they work brilliantly because children can instantly see the fronts of the books and pick out their favourite.” The room had previously felt cold and unwelcoming, so to give some much-needed warmth, the flimsy white curtains were swapped for naptime-friendly soft teal ones with a blackout backing, while a thick rug went on the floor for cosiness underfoot and to help with sound buffering. The design team also dressed the window seat with cushions and added boxes underneath for yet more storage, giving this previously unloved and underused area of the room a real purpose. The couple painted a feature wall a cheerful apricot shade – covering up the ugly grey square – and finishing touches included artificial plants for a splash of greenery; a practical fold-up playmat, which can be stored away when not in use; and a sweet Flisat doll’s house wall shelf. Stephanie and Andy have been blown away by the transformation. “It looks and feels completely different. I can’t believe all this was possible in such a tight, tricky space. It’s gorgeous, and we keep walking in and just staring at it!” laughs Stephanie. “There’s so much storage and so many clever ideas – any potential problems have been pre-empted and sorted before we’d even considered them, and I love the fact the room will grow with our child, too. Every bit of space has been used wisely – I’d never have thought to put the cot in the middle of the room, mount cabinets behind the door, use a trolley for feeding kit or divide up the drawers, but it all fits perfectly and makes so much sense.” Now the couple feel more confident and excited to take on the challenges of new parenthood. “Even if I go into labour early, we’re so ready – there’s no panic or worry any more. It’s like a huge weight has been lifted from my mind. This room has gone from being a dark, random space to a breath of fresh air – light, comfortable, friendly and useful. Now all we need is the baby to enjoy it with!” With inventive solutions for everything from clutter busting to lighting and decor, IKEA is on a mission to turn every home into a sanctuary.

5/14/2022,"Iam writing these words having just returned from the funeral of Shireen Abu Aqleh in Jerusalem. It is hard to describe the exact emotions which every Palestinian is feeling. One thing is certain: this has been the most incredible outpouring of emotion I’ve seen in Palestine. Shireen was known to every Palestinian household. During the second intifada – a formative experience for many Palestinians – she was the face that delivered us the news. The TV screen became a window to everything going on: the F16 strikes, the Apache helicopter strikes, the tanks on the streets. And Shireen was out there, bringing the news to our homes. We grew up watching her and she became an icon, inspiring a generation of Palestinian journalists. This is why Shireen’s killing during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in Jenin shook all Palestinians to the core. We feel like we have lost a mother; I personally have lost a major inspiration in my journalistic life. On the day she died, every Palestinian was heartbroken. Today in Jerusalem, thousands of Palestinians came to commemorate Shireen’s memory. There were people as far as the eye could see. Jerusalem never looked more Palestinian. And even in our grief, Israeli forces unleashed violence against the mourners and pallbearers. If you do that with the world’s gaze upon you, it is because you believe there will be no consequences. Shireen has united Palestinians of all political affiliations and persuasions behind our national flag – to mourn, protest and make sure her loss is not in vain. What has made it all the worse is the Israeli propaganda machine, which swung into action as soon as news broke of Shireen’s killing. Shortly after her death, the Israeli foreign ministry launched a social media campaign to deflect blame and gaslight Palestinians. It was debunked within hours. Israeli officials know the weight of this news. By spreading disinformation and false propaganda, they hope to muddy the waters and obscure the truth of what happened in Jenin. I do not expect justice for Shireen Abu Aqleh. According to the International Federation of Journalists, Israeli forces have killed at least 46 Palestinian journalists since 2000, while 50 Palestinians are suspected to have been killed this year alone.

5/14/2022,"In August 1945, I was an aircraft apprentice helping to produce torpedo bombers for the war in the Pacific. The immediate effect on me of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the subsequent Japanese surrender, was to make that job redundant. I hoped that henceforth my talents would be devoted to more peaceful purposes in a world without war. How naive I was. By the time I read John Hersey’s Hiroshima I was convinced that there was no future for the human race unless nuclear weapons were abolished. I still believe so (Forgetting the apocalypse: why our nuclear fears faded – and why that’s dangerous, 12 May). So long as they exist, there is a probability that they will be used – by design, miscalculation, accident, malfunction or escalation. Any event that has a finite probability will eventually happen. The first leader of a nuclear weapon power who acknowledges this, really means it, and ensures that it will never happen by turning words into deeds, will be the greatest statesman/stateswoman in history. I submit to all present (mis)leaders and future aspirants that to leave such a legacy is a more worthwhile ambition than merely being the head of a “superpower”. Failing that, the ordinary people of the world must awaken from their sleepwalk to Armageddon, and claim their right to a secure future in a nuclear-weapon-free world.Frank JacksonFormer co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign  Daniel Immerwahr concludes: “Our nuclear consciousness is badly atrophied. We’re left with a world full of nuclear weapons but emptying of people who understand their consequences.” A group of people who do understand the consequences is the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). A charitable wing of the CND offers talks to schools across the country on the awful potential of these horrifying weapons. There are still some who seek to alter this fateful trajectory.Dr Douglas SaltmarsheLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/14/2022,"Congratulations to Aditya Chakrabortty for providing a judicious account of the ludicrous “portraitgate” scandal that so enraged the rightwing press last summer (Hate mail and death threats: how the right wrecked one man’s life for its culture war, 12 May). It’s easy to forget how deranged that period was. Having to negotiate an obstacle course of journalists on Magdalen Bridge, for example. They were courting students like me, presumably desperate for some nugget of juicy portrait-based gossip – I’ve heard that undergraduates were providing contradictory quotes to competing reporters as a two-fingered salute to the whole enterprise. In any case, the press’s unforgivable treatment of the then Magdalen College MCR president, Matthew Katzman, deserves further scrutiny. A slightly more substantial figure than the article makes out (strategy board games and bins are just two of a wide variety of interests, I’m sure), his enforced exile is a loss to the college, and to Britain generally.Dominic McGinleyMagdalen College, Oxford  An interesting article and so clearly indicative of our shattered and divisive society; divisions that are endlessly reinforced by our uncontrollable rightwing press. What a feeding frenzy they enjoyed. I despair at this ugly status quo, which invades our daily lives. I am pro-monarchy but can find no possible offence to royalty or society in this young man’s actions – nothing that could explain the ensuing hysteria and the petty, vicious persecution he faced. The journalists who are guilty of this cowardly misrepresentation of a perfectly trivial issue should be made to apologise to Matthew Katzman for having visited this nightmare on him.Cynthia DunnBristol  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/14/2022,"Sheku Bayoh was “murdered” by police officers, his best friend has told the inquiry into the 31-year-old’s death in custody, as he gave halting and emotional testimony on the first day of fresh evidence-gathering. Zahid Saeed, who had known the father of two since he was 17, struggled to answer questions from Angela Grahame QC, senior counsel for the inquiry, about Bayoh’s behaviour at a party the night before his death. Asked about a previous written statement in which he said that both had taken drugs at the party, Saeed appeared reluctant to answer questions about his friend’s behaviour. Later witnesses on Friday said Bayoh had been fighting with another man near his home in Kirkcaldy, Fife, and carrying an 8in kitchen knife. Bayoh died after police officers responded to reports of a black man in an agitated state carrying a knife on 3 May 2015. He was hit with batons, CS spray and pepper spray, then restrained on the pavement with wrist and leg ties. A toxicology report confirmed that Bayoh had taken some drugs that night, but no bladed weapon was found. Saeed told the hearing he has been through two traumas, explaining: “First one was my son who was killed, then my friend, who was murdered in police custody.” Saeed’s three-year-old son, Mikaeel Kular, was killed by his mother in 2014. He went on: “The questions you should be asking is to the police officers, not me, not me.” He said repeatedly that he wanted to complete his evidence in one day, and explain how he was treated by police officers after Bayoh’s death, “how I was held for 11 hours in police custody without offering me any liquid … how I was dehumanised”. Grahame reassured him this experience was “part of this inquiry” but that for the purposes of Friday’s hearing the focus was on the events leading up to the police callout. With Saeed increasingly unwilling to answer key questions abut the timeline leading up to his friend’s death, Grahame told him: “The biggest help you could be to your friend, your brother Shek, right now is to help the chair understand some of what you said in your statement … to tell the whole truth about everything that happened.” Saeed responded: “The truth is that he was murdered in police custody, what else is there to tell?” Eventually, Lord Bracadale, chairing the inquiry, adjourned his evidence until a later date, after Grahame said she would look into “an alternative environment or other arrangements that might permit Saeed to continue more effectively with this examination”. Later on Friday a neighbour, Neil Morgan, described how he had encountered Bayoh, whom he described as “pleasant, friendly, a really nice guy, never no trouble”. Morgan said he had been alerted to a disturbance in a nearby garden on 3 May at about 7.30am, and went outside to investigate, whereupon he encountered Bayoh, who “wasn’t himself” and was carrying a knife. “I said to him: ‘You can’t go round with that knife, you’ll get done,’” Morgan said. “Then he turned around to me and he said: ‘It’s not even sharp’ and sort of poked it at my belly.” When Grahame asked about his reaction to this, Morgan replied: “Nothing really. I certainly didn’t feel threatened by him”. Another neighbour, Naomi Rhodes, also giving evidence, said she was woken by shouting outside her bedroom window the same morning and saw two males, one of whom was Bayoh, fighting in the street. She said that Bayoh was a “friendly-natured” neighbour, and that such behaviour was out of character.

5/14/2022,"The high-ceilinged wood-panelled court 13 at the Royal Courts of Justice has been packed this week for the libel case brought by Rebekah Vardy against Coleen Rooney. The trial centres on whether Vardy was or was not involved in leaking stories from Rooney’s private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun. In the process the court has heard exchanges about emojis, slang and chipolatas. Rooney’s barrister pressed Vardy on whether she had leaked a detail about unhappy players at Leicester City football club – where her husband, Jamie, is a star striker. David Sherborne asked: “Did you or did you not know that the ‘lads were fuming’?” Vardy replied: “Jamie and I never discussed whether ‘the lads were fuming’”. Vardy began answering a question with the words: “If I’m honest … ” Sherborne shot back: “I would hope you’re honest because you’re sitting in a witness box.” Vardy said she accidentally lost all of her WhatsApp images during a dodgy backup that went wrong, while uploading the documents for disclosure to her solicitors: “Something odd happened as I was exporting the files.” She was also asked how nine months of more recent WhatsApp exchanges with her agent had also been lost. Vardy told the court she may have “potentially switched phones” during the period but “I can neither confirm or deny that”. Rooney has sat in the front row of the courtroom, accompanied by her husband, Wayne. She looked on intently as the court heard a quote that Vardy gave to the Daily Mail, shortly after the original leaking accusation was made: “Arguing with Coleen is like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong but it’s still going to shit in your hair.” A running theme of the trial has been the court struggling to understand how to interpret the emojis included in WhatsApp messages involving Vardy – including the difference between 😆 and 😭. At one point, Sherborne read out a WhatsApp message sent by Vardy, saying “Poor Coleen” followed by “laughing emojis”. Vardy disputed this characterisation: “I don’t know whether they’re laughing emojis.” Sherborne replied, somewhat dismissively: “OK, crying with laughter.” Vardy was questioned about a 2004 kiss-and-tell story she sold to the News of the World. The court heard she said: “Peter’s hung like a small chipolata ... the smallest trouser equipment I’ve ever seen.” Sherborne asked Vardy: “Did you feel particularly strongly that the size of his [Andre’s] manhood should be made public?” Vardy, arguing she was coerced into giving the interview: “It was something I was forced to say.” Sherborne asked Vardy about a term included in some of the messages: “What does FFS stand for?” Vardy: “Can I?” Judge: “Yes.” Vardy: “For fuck’s sake.” Sherborne confirmed he just wanted to check he understood the term. Sherborne finished his opening remarks by asking a question that has occurred to many observing the trial: “This whole court might just think: ‘Why on earth are we here?’”",News/UK news,A pigeon and a chipolata?

5/14/2022,"In Stoke on Thursday to discuss the cost of living crisis, Boris Johnson told his cabinet: “Folks, we’re going to get through this … jobs, jobs, jobs is the answer.” Just hours later, it emerged that almost one in five civil servants are set to lose theirs. Rishi Sunak’s spending review last October had already set an aim of returning to 2019-20 levels of Whitehall staffing – pre-pandemic levels – by 2025; but this new pledge would see the civil service back to its pre-Brexit size. It is the only the latest in a long line of efficiency drives aimed at slimming down Whitehall. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown commissioned businessman Sir Peter Gershon to recommend ways the civil service could be leaner. One of his recommendations when the report was published in 2004 was a reduction of more than 70,000 civil service posts – as well as large-scale redeployment from backroom to frontline roles. When the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition arrived in 2010, pledging to repair the damage done to the public finances by the global financial crisis (or as they would have it, by Gordon Brown), civil service job cuts were a central part of its austerity strategy. Frances Maude was brought in to recommend reforms. The size of the civil service declined sharply throughout the coalition’s period in office, from a peak of around 490,000 in 2009, to fewer than 390,000 before the EU referendum in 2016. As the cuts intensified, there were growing strains in some departments – as well as stories of seasoned experts being hired back into departments as consultants at a higher cost. Alex Thomas, of the Institute for Government, points to the Department of Health and Defra as departments where crucial expertise was lost in repeated efficiency drives and subsequently came to be needed. Of Defra, he says: “It was a department that had to rebuild quite significantly from 2016 onwards, and some of the people who really knew the ins and outs of EU regulations in the environmental and agricultural field were not there any more.” After Brexit, the number of civil servants surged almost back to 2009 levels, as the government tooled up to negotiate the UK’s exit with a full-blown Brexit department – since dismantled – and took on tasks it had long subcontracted to the EU, such as trade negotiation. Nevertheless, Johnson’s target of 91,000 job cuts is an ambitious one. The latest official figures show there were 475,020 full-time equivalent staff in the civil service in December – so success would mean 19% of them leaving the payroll. The policy serves more than one purpose: it aims to save money, at a time when Rishi Sunak is reluctant to open the purse strings; and fits with the Johnson government’s ideological suspicion that the public sector is stuffed with pettifogging remainers. Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings was fighting his own personal war against the Whitehall “blob” before he was ejected in November 2020, but senior ministers have continued to attack civil servants publicly. Johnson himself recently complained of a “post-Covid work-from-home mañana culture,” while the Tory chair, Oliver Dowden, urged civil servants to “get off their Pelotons and back to their desks”. More recently, the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has infuriated Whitehall staff by carrying out spot-checks of departments and leaving passive-aggressive notes on the desks of staff who were working from home. Thomas, a former civil servant himself, says if part of the government’s motivation is to go to war with Whitehall, it won’t make this latest efficiency drive any easier. “If ministers are serious about reforming the civil service and reducing civil service numbers, it’s hard enough already without trying to pit the civil service against you.” And when it comes to savings, which the government claims will be more than £3bn, these are not always as great as hoped, says Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “It depends what you spend on the redundancy payments, which is not a trivial element, and it depends whether you end up hiring people back in a couple of years,” he said, adding that picking an arbitrary number and pursuing it single-mindedly has its risks. “They’ve no idea whether 90,000 is the right number. You do need to monitor this quite carefully.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s civil service job cuts are ambitious – and ideological,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/boris-johnsons-civil-service-job-cuts-are-ambitious-and-ideological
