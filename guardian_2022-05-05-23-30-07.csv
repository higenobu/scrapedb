5/5/2022,"Up the road, estate agent windows display £850,000 properties and there’s a wide selection of high-end coffee shops. But in recent months, every Thursday morning, a queue has formed outside St Andrew’s church in Earlsfield, part of the London borough of Wandsworth, as the redbrick building transforms into a food bank. On this Thursday, as the spotlight falls on the flagship Conservative council in the local elections, they are not able to operate as normal with breakfast and Citizens Advice services because the venue is being used as a polling station. Before the pandemic, Earlsfield food bank used to get 30 people a week, rising to 60 this time last year. But now, since the escalating costs of living crisis, the number of people relying on its help every week often exceeds 100 – and it is considering expanding its services. But such is demand that it is continuing to distribute food outside the church from a side gate, with volunteers handing prepacked bags of groceries and essentials to guests ranging from young children and their parents to DHL drivers, people with mortgages and elderly people. “There are so many people that are struggling,” says Charlotte White, who manages the independent food bank. “Sometimes, by the time we open, we have a queue of about 20 or 30.” In previous years, numbers have started to tail off with the warmer weather, but now need is greater and more complex than ever. “When people come for the first time, they’re really in need. We get people who haven’t eaten for a couple of days,” White says. From a storage room, they distribute bags of items including fresh food, non-perishables and toilet roll. But with donations going down as its usual donors make cuts, it also has to buy stock and is going to have to stop distributing more expensive items such as nappies. Guests are given a number when they arrive and are called when it is their turn to collect their goods. But for those who are in a rush for work or have job interviews, packages are put aside ready for them so they don’t have to wait. Among those waiting for her number to be called is a 65-year-old woman, who has been coming on Thursdays for about a month. She hasn’t eaten yet because she usually gets breakfast from the food bank. Unable to work due to a knee injury and not yet eligible for a state pension, without the food bank she would be struggling, saying: “After bills there’s nothing left.” While she does not get involved in politics, she said the difference between the lives of MPs and everybody else is plain. “We’re feeling the squeeze down here, they’re doing their partying, drinking, eating their pizza.” Charlotte Littlefield, 47, a mother-of-four, stops by with her 10-year-old son. She first started going to the food bank when she was left unable to work due to health issues and her benefits were changed. “I actually don’t know what I’d do without the food bank right now,” she said, adding that everything is going up in price. “I literally have to choose between food and heat and hot water. I’ve not felt so desperate in my lifetime.” Meanwhile, politicians, she said, are “all as bad as each other”. Annmarie, 49, who has two 13-year-old children, has been coming to the food bank for two months and has also used their Citizens Advice services. She wants to see more help to find work for people with children or those who are struggling with debts or ill health. “Lots of people in this community are very talented, but where can we find them? Right in the food bank.”",News/Society,‘I have to choose between food and heat’: demand soars at food bank in Tory held Wandsworth,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/05/i-have-to-choose-between-food-and-heat-demand-soars-at-food-bank-in-tory-held-wandsworth
5/5/2022,"A library is keen for people to come and see a century-old lost treasure it discovered during lockdown – but do think about bringing a magnifying glass. “Or really strong glasses,” said Rhian Isaac, special collections senior librarian at Leeds Libraries, talking about an 876-page Bible with Old and New Testaments which is less than 5cm in size. “It just looks like small squiggles, it really is tiny.” The Bible dates from 1911 and is a replica of a chained Bible that people might find in a cathedral – chained so people didn’t make off with it. “It was a novelty really, it wouldn’t have been an expensive thing,” said Isaac. “It was billed as the smallest Bible in the world, but if you look into it, it wasn’t.” The Bible was published by the American branch of the Oxford University Press and states it “can easily be read with a magnifying glass”. It was discovered as a result of a comprehensive survey of uncatalogued items in the Leeds collections, carried out during Covid lockdowns. The search yielded more than 3,000 items, which sounds like a huge figure, but was not a total surprise, Isaac said. “I think a lot of libraries have similar problems. With these objects, if people did know about them they were in people’s heads. In this day and age if objects aren’t online then people don’t think you have them.” Other newly catalogued items include photographs from the 1904 rescue mission of Captain Scott’s first expedition to Antarctica by the crew of The Morning ship. Another object is huge compared with the resurfaced Bible: a magnificent and rare botanical book by Priscilla Susan Bury called A Selection of Hexandrian Plants, published 1831-1834. Measuring 64cm by 48cm, it had only 79 subscribers, one of them being the Birds of America illustrator John James Audubon. Isaac said the important message was that anyone could come in to the library and view the objects. “You don’t have to be an academic or a researcher,” she said. “If you’re just interested, we can get them out for you and you can come and read them in our beautiful Grade II-listed building, which is a wonderful place to come and do some studying. “We would rather these books were used and read. That’s what they were made for and that’s what we encourage people to come in and do, instead of locking them away.” There may also be someone who knows precisely why the tiny Bible is in the Leeds collection in the first place. “We don’t know. It’s a bit of a mystery really.”",Arts/Books,Tiny 1911 Bible rediscovered at Leeds library in lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/05/tiny-1911-bible-rediscovered-at-leeds-library-in-lockdown
5/5/2022,"Yvonne Blenkinsop, who has died aged 83, was one of four charismatic fishermen’s wives who transformed the safety of UK trawlers in 1968 with a barnstorming campaign. Their grief and outrage after the loss of three Hull ships and 58 crew in less than a month struck a nerve in public opinion, winning reforms that management and politicians had fenced over for years. The Vietnam war was driven off newspaper front pages as the women and their supporters woke Britain up to the cost in human lives of the cosy national favourite, fish and chips. Labour’s future deputy leader, John Prescott, then a young seamen’s union official, helped them make a giant wood-and-cardboard cod on wheels, smeared with blood-red paint to drive the message home. A fish filleter, Lillian “Big Lil” Bilocca, was the frontwoman for the quartet; Mary Denness was a clever and determined skipper’s wife; and Christine Smallbone, later Jensen, was a formidable committee woman and a match for the then prime minister, Harold Wilson. Blenkinsop was equally can-do – she wrote down 27 crucial safety measures soon after hearing of the first sinking, on 11 January 1968, when the St Romanus went down in a North Sea storm with all 20 crew members. She also brought a little stardust and lot of know-how to the campaign from her work as a cabaret singer, Yvonne the Golden Girl with the Golden Voice. It was her sound system the women used when they held a packed meeting near Hull docks before storming the trawler company offices, picketing the quays and raising 10,000 signatures on a Fisherman’s Charter that they took to London and a welcome from respectful crowds. Meanwhile, the Kingston Peridot had sunk near Iceland on 27 January, probably overwhelmed by iced-up rigging, and the Ross Cleveland capsized on 4 February in hurricane-force winds and blizzards as she sought shelter in an Icelandic fjord. Other ships tried to help in vain and two more trawlers sank nearby, one Icelandic, whose crew all died.The last message from the Ross Cleveland’s skipper Phil Gay, Smallbone’s older brother, read: “I am going over. We are laying over. Help me. I am going over. Give my love and the crew’s love to the wives and families.” These sledgehammer blows to the tight community of fishing families on Hessle Road in Hull shook a long-standing fatalism about the toll of the sea, but the women still faced resentment locally from those who thought that they were endangering jobs. Bilocca kept a file of poison-pen letters and was sacked and blacklisted. Blenkinsop was punched in the face at the height of the campaign when she took her husband out to a local restaurant to celebrate his birthday. Undeterred, they worked as a team, never fell out and knew they had won after six weeks when the Golden Voice asked JPW Mallalieu, minister of state at the Board of Trade: “Are you going to do something for us, petal?” and he said yes. Measures including radio operators on all ships, extra crew training, better safety equipment, more accurate weather forecasting and a mother ship with hospital facilities for each fishing fleet were agreed after two hours, and 88 improvements became law. The women’s skill lay in seeing that the government had countless duties and concerns, but fishing safety had to be made No 1 for as long as it took to drive the reforms through. The miners, whose industry was much less dangerous in terms of lives lost, had shown the way, but the campaigners also had ingrained experience from juggling duties at home. Blenkinsop was 30 at the time, with four children; she had taken charge of five siblings at the age of 16 when her father, a trawlerman, had a fatal heart attack at sea, beyond medical help. Her mother later collapsed from nervous exhaustion that had its origins in the Hull blitz. Multi-tasking was second-nature to Blenkinsop and she combined her family life with her work in cabaret, where her cheerful candour was as potent as her voice and looks. She was born, as Yvonne Marie Horsfield, and brought up in Hessle Road and, like the other women, played her part in less dramatic campaigns to improve road safety and local living conditions. After the heady drama of the “headscarf revolutionaries”, as the women were called in the media (although Blenkinsop’s pile of golden hair defied any scarf), she kept in touch with the fishing industry and safety issues, as well as a growing family of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She was consulted by the Marconi company when radio operating was standardised after the campaign. She enjoyed the increasing interest in the campaigners’ shared story over the years and the diligent work in making it more widely known by the authors Ian Cuthbert and Brian Lavery and the playwright and actor Maxine Peake (whose play The Last Testament of Lillian Bilocca was staged at the Hull Guildhall in 2017). Blenkinsop experienced ill health in her later years, but went in person with all her trademark cheerfulness to a grand ceremony in 2018 when she became the third woman in 130 years to be given the freedom of the city of Hull. She was equally chuffed to switch on the city’s Christmas lights. Her husband, John Blenkinsop, died in 2004. She is survived by her children, Yvette, Brian, Colette and Jonmarie, 10 grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.  Yvonne Blenkinsop, fishing safety campaigner, born 19 May 1938; died 24 April 2022",News/Business,Yvonne Blenkinsop obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/yvonne-blenkinsop-obituary
5/5/2022,"Writing songs brought out the best in Samuel Barber. He had an ear for good texts and responded to them concisely and precisely, an impression reinforced by this double CD, which brings together all the songs he is known to have written. These include 19 that haven’t been recorded before, many dating from Barber’s earliest days as a composer – but that is no drawback when you consider that he was still a student when he made his masterly setting of Matthew Arnold’s poem Dover Beach. It’s the baritone Julian Van Mellaerts who sings Dover Beach here, with the Navarra Quartet, in a performance that has considerable immediacy if not the vocal velvet that, say, Thomas Hampson has brought to it on disc. Van Mellaerts is one of 10 UK-based singers assembled here by the pianist Dylan Perez, a team headed by the tenor Nicky Spence and soprano Mary Bevan, who makes poised work of the Hermit Songs. It also includes a number of rising names: William Thomas, Soraya Mafi, Samantha Clarke, Jess Dandy. One of the recording’s pleasures is the way the songs come to life through 10 different characters, but with Perez as a constant, eloquent presence (he plays on all the songs save Dover Beach). As a characterful overview of Barber’s songwriting – and equally as a snapshot of emerging vocal talent – this is a very rewarding collection. The unfamiliar songs include a setting of Shelley’s Music, When Soft Voices Die that’s no worse for a touch of reverence, a lovely setting of Frost’s Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening, and a harmonically fussy but interesting Au clair de la lune. It culminates in what’s claimed as the first recording of the voice and piano version of Knoxville: Summer of 1915, not with the usual soprano soloist but with Spence, who is becoming one of the most engaging and communicative singers around. Countertenor Jakub Józef Orlinski’s Farewells likewise plays with our expectation of which voice should sing what. Temporarily setting the world of baroque music aside, Orliński has teamed up with the pianist Michał Biel for a whole programme of Polish art song by Szymanowski, Moniuszko, Tadeusz Baird and others. And yes, there are moments when you miss the heft a fruity mezzo-soprano or baritone could bring to a certain note or phrase, but Orliński’s commitment and directness win through, showcasing some real gems.",Arts/Music,Samuel Barber: The Complete Songs review | Erica Jeal's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/05/samuel-barber-the-complete-songs-review-perez-bevan-spence
5/5/2022,"Boris Becker will be considered for deportation, the Home Office has confirmed, as experts said the potential battle could set a legal precedent and Becker may have to represent himself in court if he wants to remain in the UK. Last week, the former tennis star was jailed for two years and six months for hiding millions of pounds’ worth of assets after being made bankrupt in June 2017. Becker, sentenced under the Insolvency Act, will serve half the full prison term. A Home Office spokesperson said that while it did not routinely comment on individual cases, “any foreign national who is convicted of a crime and given a prison sentence is considered for deportation at the earliest opportunity”. Such a development is likely to make case history because the Home Office may claim that Becker’s criminal offences continued after the Brexit withdrawal agreement was implemented on 31 December 2020, which made immigration law for EU citizens more stringent. This ambiguity means Becker, who is not thought to have taken British citizenship, could either be considered for deportation under the previous, more relaxed version of the UK Borders Act 2007, or the updated version, which was implemented on 31 December 2020. Fighting against it could cost up to £30,000, experts said, meaning Becker may have to represent himself in court as a litigant in person. “If the criminal conduct took place after 31 December 2020 then Becker is subject to automatic deportation because he received a sentence of 12 months or more,” said Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister and author of Welcome to Britain: Fixing Our Broken Immigration System. “He could attempt to resist deportation on human rights grounds but we have seen young black men who have lived in the UK far longer than Becker, sometimes since early childhood, deported for lower sentences than Becker received. “If the conduct took place before that date, he benefits from the protection of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement. He would still be considered for deportation and the Home Office would be likely to attempt to deport him but he’d have a stronger legal case for staying.” Christopher Cole, a consultant solicitor in immigration and asylum law for DG Legal, said Becker’s was the first case he had seen that would test the new legal landscape. “It’s uncharted territory: I’m not aware of any cases like this one, where the courts have had to decide which side of the dividing line the offending behaviour occurred,” he said. If the court decides the offending behaviour continued until Becker’s sentencing last week, the home secretary is likely to press on with an attempt to deport him, said Cole. “More often than not, because of the political pressure on the Home Office, wherever possible they will try to make a decision to deport any foreign national offender even if it looks like they’ve got a fairly weak case and there’s a very high chance of that person succeeding on appeal,” said Cole. “Even if they think they’re almost bound to lose, more often than not they will make a decision to deport and that would then lead to an appeal to the tribunal.” In this case, Becker will either have to find up to £30,000 or represent himself as a litigant in person, he added. Zeena Luchowa, a senior solicitor at Laura Devine Immigration and member of the Law Society’s immigration committee, said if Becker’s conduct was deemed to have been committed after 31 December 2020, a deportation can be made if deemed “conducive to the public good”. “This gives discretion to the Home Office to act in a way that reflects the public interest – and given Home Office’s position on criminality when it comes to foreign nationals they are unlikely to let this one go.” Becker, she added, could appeal on human rights grounds or an application could be made for the deportation order to be revoked if compassionate circumstances were found. But appeals can typically take six to 12 months to be processed and are very expensive, said Leon Glenister, a barrister at Landmark Chambers. “The presumption is that he will receive a deportation order but although one has to consider his right to a private and family life, I can’t see that is going to give him much hope. “Even if Becker goes to a high street lawyer to defend him, costs can reach £30,000. The only other option is for him to represent himself as a litigant in person. This is not unheard of but it can be quite complicated, so it’s not advised.”",Sport/Sport,"Boris Becker could face deportation from UK, Home Office confirms",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/05/boris-becker-could-face-deportation-home-office-confirms

5/5/2022,"The wonderful thing about Darth Vader, as far as Star Wars creatives must be concerned, is that while he did eventually cop it during the events of the original George Lucas film trilogy, he was alive and kicking for a much longer period than we’ve generally witnessed on either big or small screens. There was that powerful season two finale to Star Wars Rebels, in which the Sith Lord battled his former apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, and of course the brief scenes in 2016’s excellent film Rogue One, both of which featured the return of James Earl Jones’ essential velvety tones. What then of Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi, the forthcoming Disney+ TV show in which Hayden Christensen, he of the execrable prequels, is billed as Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader? Even in the original movie, 2005’s Revenge of the Sith, in which the Jedi Knight finally falls to the dark side, Lucas had Jones voice the not-so-iconic scene in which Anakin finally pulls on the dreaded shiny black armour. Perhaps it was still Christensen in the suit – he certainly looked like a much titchier Vader than the one portrayed physically by British bodybuilder Dave Prowse in the 70s and 80s films. But even if it was, the Canadian actor didn’t exactly have much to do. With the second full trailer for the six-part Obi-Wan Kenobi having dropped yesterday for Star Wars Day, the question of quite how Vader will be portrayed in the limited series has been pulled even more sharply into focus. Those who are secretly hoping Deborah Chow and her team are about to right all the wrongs of the prequels might well be disappointed, and the biggest problem could well be Christensen. One of the greatest problems with George Lucas’s second Star Wars trilogy is that it was never really possible to connect the whiny teenager of Attack of the Clones and most of Revenge of the Sith to the monumentally badass figure seen in 1977’s Star Wars and its followups. This is, of course, not entirely Christensen’s fault, as he had the twin horrors of too much green screen acting and terrible screenwriting to cope with. But it’s hard not to imagine that if Lucas had had an actor of the calibre of Adam Driver (Kylo Ren in the equally middling but usually well-acted sequel trilogy) he would have found something more in those stale, stale, whingey lines of angst and misery. Now Christensen is returning to battle Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan, who in the events of the series is holed up on Tatooine in a cave, masquerading as Ben Kenobi (which, when you think of it, is not the most spectacular pseudonym) and keeping one eye out for the safety of a preteen Luke Skywalker. It appears Vader has sent various baddies out into space to try to track him down, namely Rupert Friend’s Grand Inquisitor (a sort-of Imperial SS-type) and his red lightsaber-wielding minion, Reva. McGregor, we know, will be a tour de force in the new show, even if he is given the most limited material to work with. Friend and Moses Ingram, as Reva, already look like two of the coolest Star Wars villains we’ve yet seen. The return of Joel Edgerton as Anakin’s step-brother Owen Lars in the new trailer is hugely welcome – the Australian is a serious Hollywood player these days even if his role in the prequels was pretty limited. But Chow’s best bet here would be to keep Christensen’s involvement to a minimum, perhaps appearing only briefly during a scene in which Vader’s suit is damaged and his original voice bleeds through – something similar happened during the previously mentioned battle with Ahsoka Tano. This would allow Reva and the Grand Inquisitor to do most of the bad guy heavy lifting, leaving Vader as more of a background figure. And yet Christensen’s involvement has been so heavily trailed that you wonder if this is the way Lucasfilm is planning to go. There’s also the issue of continuity to deal with. The best Star Wars entries of the past 20 years, like Rogue One, have somehow managed to close gaping plot holes in earlier films (how did the Rebels manage to blow up the Death Star?) rather than opening new ones. And yet if Obi-Wan really does come face to face with Vader once again, what does that do to the line in 1977’s Star Wars in which the Sith Lord states: “We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you I was but the learner. Now, I am the master”? It would now make about as much sense as Lucas’s decision to add loads of dodgy CGI to the original trilogy. There’s a danger here that without the 91-year-old Jones doing the iconic voice, Lucasfilm might end up ruining yet another major Star Wars player, after the difficulties the studio had with a certain bounty hunter in the recent The Book of Boba Fett. Avoiding that fate, if Christensen really is going to be front and centre here, seems about as likely as successfully navigating an asteroid field (though it should be pointed out, this has been done before). Perhaps I’m worrying about nothing. Perhaps it will all be fine, and they secretly have Jones signed up. I love Star Wars, and I desperately want this one to be as good as The Mandalorian. But if the plan really is to have Christensen as the major antagonist here … well, I’m starting to get a bad feeling about this.

5/5/2022,"An ancient manuscript by the French astrologer Michel de Nostredame, better known as Nostradamus, stolen from a library in Rome has been returned to the Italian capital. The manuscript, entitled Nostradamus M Prophecies and dating back about 300 years, was rediscovered last year when it was put up for sale by a German auction house. It is unclear exactly when the 500-page manuscript was stolen from the historical studies centre of the Barnabite fathers of Rome, but it is believed to have been in about 2007. The book passed through flea markets in Paris and the German city of Karlsruhe before an art dealer tried to sell it through an auction house in Pforzheim, Baden-Württemberg, at a starting price of €12,000 (£10,200). In April last year investigators from Italy’s cultural heritage protection squad came across the book on the auction house’s website and identified it as originating from the library in Rome via a stamp dated 1991 on one of the pages. Rome’s public prosecutor contacted his counterpart in Pforzheim, who began an investigation. German experts established the book was an original work of Nostradamus, who was famous for his cryptic prediction of world events, and was the one trafficked from Rome. The manuscript was returned to the library on Wednesday. Italy’s cultural heritage protection team was established in 1969 and has retrieved more than 3m stolen artefacts. In December 2021 the US returned about 200 antiquities, including an ancient Roman sculpture that almost ended up in the possession of Kim Kardashian West, that had been stolen and smuggled out of Italy.",News/World news,Stolen Nostradamus manuscript is returned to library in Rome,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/stolen-nostradamus-manuscript-is-returned-to-library-in-rome
5/5/2022,"Was ever a debut show longer awaited? Chloe Petts’ first solo hour was good to go just as Covid reared its spikes, since when – solo shows be damned! – she has established herself as one of our most compelling young comics. But it’s still a treat to discover what she can do with an hour to herself, in a show, Transience, that’s evolved from its nipped-in-the-bud 2020 predecessor. What she can do is wade into the thorniest conversations of our time – to do with gender fluidity, male privilege and toxic masculinity – and emerge with a show that’s all sweet nature and smiles. That she does so without soft-soaping or compromising on her own beliefs is the sign of a skilful comic – as are the jokes, which keep proceedings buoyant throughout. The gist is that Petts, 28, is living life as “the man I always wanted to be” – but not always accepted as such by everyone else. Her femininity questioned by a woman in the queue for the loos, her masculinity doubted by fellow fans at Crystal Palace’s Selhurst Park, Petts arrives on stage with a perspective that’s precision-made for insight. The way women and (mainly) men behave, those gendered codes most of us barely notice, Petts spends her life puzzling at and often preferring not to accept. Not that she considers herself superior: she happily turns the jokes on herself here, pretending to a masculine swagger that seldom survives contact with the real, bewildering world. Witness her (and the shopkeeper’s) awkwardness and confusion when Petts is misgendered in a corner shop. Or her impromptu reaction when shoved to the ground by an aggressive male pedestrian. Such moments remind Petts, sometimes brutally, of her contested place on the gender spectrum. But in a show that casts her journey between the binaries as a voyage of unexpected and often joyful discovery, they are reported in a spirit of cheerful anthropological curiosity. Ending with a plea that we relax the rigidity of our gender thinking, Petts makes a fine contribution to that cause, and takes the heat out of a fraught conversation, with a first show that was worth waiting for.

But in the past few years a new type of “medical tourist” has emerged: those seeking to radically extend their lives. There are more older people than ever before – and more people in search of longevity. In the UK, people over the age of 65 made up 19% of the population in 2019, a jump of 23% from 2009, in a period when the total population only increased by 7%. And recent advancements in the science of ageing have given them hope that they don’t have to go so gently into that good night after all. But while science has made some promising breakthroughs in studying the causes and implications of ageing, real solutions are some way off. In that gap between supply and demand, a host of fraudsters and scam artists are ready to take advantage of anyone gullible enough to believe they can pay a little extra for a few extra years among the living. Many offer their services abroad, in countries where regulation is light. Medical tourism has produced a steady stream of horror stories since cheaper air travel kickstarted a rise in its popularity, from botched nose jobs and broken smiles to a fair number of deaths. Despite this, it remains a gigantic industry. According to Patients Beyond Borders, the global medical tourism market was worth $74bn-$92bn (£59bn-£73bn) in 2019. A prime example is stem cell therapies, regenerative treatments aiming to use the body’s building-block cells to rejuvenate and fix damage caused by disease or deterioration – an area of research with a lot of potential but relatively few established and approved treatments available to patients. However, the potential effects, most often exaggerated or unsubstantiated, lure the desperate to travel far and wide to seek treatments, sometimes from practitioners of ill repute. According to research published last year, the leading countries for stem cell tourism are the US, China, India, Thailand and Mexico. The same report states that “stem cell technologies are often associated with inflated expectations of their therapeutic potential”. Stem cell therapies can also help with cancer and other illness, but during my reporting for my book The Price of Immortality: The Race to Live Forever, I found a number of examples of US-based stem cell companies offering miracle cures and solutions to ageing. One clinic in Iowa was found to have made outrageous claims in presentations to potential clients. “Anti-Aging: Mesenchymal Stem Cell infusions turned back the hands of Father Time about three years! Would you like to get back three years?” read one slide of sales material, collected by the state attorney general’s office that was suing the company for false advertising. Even when prosecuted or disciplined in one country, stem cell practitioners have been known to move on and continue to offer the same services elsewhere. One in Florida had his medical licence revoked in 2015, after two of his patients undergoing stem cell therapy had died. When I looked up the name of the doctor, he was listed as the chief science officer at another stem cell company. A cheerful receptionist told me on a call that the clinic was still operational and carrying out procedures in the Dominican Republic, a medical tourism hotspot. Stem cell therapies are not the only anti-ageing offerings luring people abroad for treatment. The nascent field of gene therapies is in a similar position, where promising research has yet to result in accessible interventions. I also recently heard from a life extension enthusiast in the US who planned to travel to France to undergo plasmapheresis, a procedure he claimed would rejuvenate his blood and give him a better chance of living until he was 500. In some cases, patients don’t need even need to fly abroad to access drugs that have the potential to make them live longer. I spoke to an elderly woman in London who buys the cancer drug dasatinib from a website in India, and takes it in the hope it will destroy senescent cells, which are thought to play an integral role in the ageing process. Gerontologists and other researchers find the practice frustrating. Several scientists I spoke to, particularly in the stem cell field, are worried these clinics are making a quick buck on the back of their breakthroughs while damaging the reputation of these nascent medical technologies. They preach patience, a virtue in short supply for people who see the end of their lives on the horizon. Medical tourism presents clear dangers. Patients may not find the same standard of care they are used to at home, and it is harder to establish that the doctor or clinic is legitimate. Patients can also suffer from side-effects if they fly home too early after a procedure; communication barriers can also cause issues. For someone seeking treatment they can’t afford at home or a last-gasp unapproved cure for a deadly disease, these risks are worth taking. But for people merely seeking to improve their chances of living radically extended lives, the gamble is much larger, particularly when there’s no evidence that any medical intervention could work. In a best-case scenario, they leave with a lighter wallet. In the worst, their quest to live a little longer is cut ironically short.
