4/27/2022,"Elon Musk’s planned takeover of Twitter, and his desire to return what he describes as “free speech” to the platform, has buoyed many of those on the right wing in America, who have seen themselves, or their cohorts, banned in recent years. For one prominent rightwing Twitter exile, however, the prospect of a return to the powerful social media website causes mixed emotions and a difficult dilemma. If Donald Trump, who was permanently suspended from Twitter in January 2020 due to the risk of him inciting violence, rejoins the platform then he will once again have access to a tool he has acknowledged helped him defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016, taking back his ability to dictate the news cycle and communicate with the 88 million followers that were snatched away in an instant. Should Trump do so, however, it will represent an admission that Truth Social, the former president’s own ailing social media effort, released earlier this year as a supposed alternative to Twitter, has failed – adding the fledgling platform to a long list of Trump’s business missteps. But beyond the embarrassment, a return to Twitter, and to Trump firing out messages attacking Democrats and Republicans alike, could also be a dent to Republican chances in the November midterm elections. “There’s a strong case that having Trump back on Twitter would help Democrats win votes by forcing Republicans off-message, reminding swing voters how much they disliked the former president, and driving up progressive turnout,” said Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog. Senior Republicans appear to agree. After news of Musk’s takeover, news website Politico contacted several top Republican members and aides to gauge reaction to a potential Trump Twitter return. “Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” Politico reported. Trump himself has said he won’t be back, telling Fox News: ”I am going to be staying on Truth.” The twice-impeached former commander-in-chief is not known for his consistency, however. He has reportedly expressed discontent with how Truth Social has performed – “What the fuck is going on,” the Daily Beast reported Trump as asking aides in March – and to return to relevance, and to win back the spotlight he craves, the former president might need Twitter. “If he wants to intervene on behalf of a candidate he has now endorsed in the midterm elections, being able to reach that number of people with messages supporting those candidates is a way of essentially getting free advertising time to reach people who are more likely to vote as a result of getting a signal from Donald Trump,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told Time. Trump may have insisted that he will snub Twitter and stick with Truth Social, but his commitment to his own platform has so far been tepid at best – Trump has posted on Truth Social just once. If that lack of interaction hasn’t helped Truth Social, neither did the botched rollout on 21 February. Tens of thousands of people were unable to access the network – the Guardian was finally allowed in on 5 March – and by early April the Truth Social app was the 355th most popular on Apple devices. In terms of daily active users, Truth Social had 513,000, the Daily Beast reported. Twitter has about 217 million. Lack of usage – both by Trump and by the general public – is not the only problem the new network faces. Shares in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, the firm which plans to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, dropped 13% on Monday after news of Musk’s deal. Since Musk became the largest shareholder in Twitter TMTG shares have fallen by 44% overall, and two key Truth Social executives quit the platform in April. Since Trump was removed from Twitter his missives have been limited to email blasts sent from his Save America Pac, the messages frequently bleating about a “stolen election” in 2020. At the moment those emails are received by a mixture of supporters and vaguely interested journalists. If Trump resumed tweeting, he’d have a far bigger audience for his misinformation – which could have serious consequences. “The real danger would come after election day,” Gertz said, “when he could use that same megaphone to spread lies about voter fraud as a pretext for overturning elections. If that happens, another January 6 – perhaps a more successful one – is very much in play.”",News/Technology,Trump’s Twitter dilemma: will he rejoin after Elon Musk takes over?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/26/twitter-donald-trump-elon-musk-takeover
4/27/2022,"Elon Musk’s self-avowed status as a “free speech absolutist” raises the possibility he will lift the ban on people whose Twitter accounts have been permanently suspended from the platform. The world’s richest man, who has agreed to buy Twitter for $44bn (£34bn), has said he prefers giving users a “timeout” instead of a lifelong ban. Here are some of the most high-profile figures banned from Twitter who might be hoping for a reprieve. The then US president’s account was suspended on 8 January 2021, two days after the storming of the US Capitol. Announcing the ban, Twitter cited Trump’s repeated violations of the company’s rules and the risk of the “further incitement of violence”. Trump, who had more than 88 million followers when he was banned, said on Monday he does not intend to return to Twitter, sticking with his rival platform, Truth Social. The personal account of the Republican Georgia congresswoman was suspended permanently in January this year for violating policies on coronavirus misinformation. She has since expressed hope, on her official government account, that she would again be able to tweet using her private profile in the wake of the Musk deal. The rightwing conspiracy theorist’s account, and that of his Infowars website, were suspended in 2018 due to violations of the platform’s abusive behaviour policy. The two accounts had about 1.3 million followers combined. The rightwing writer was banned in 2016 for his role in the online abuse of actor Leslie Jones over her role in a reboot of Ghostbusters. Yiannopoulos told Breitbart.com his suspension was “cowardly” and evidence that Twitter was a “no-go zone for conservatives”. The popular UK news aggregation service was banned in the UK in January for violating the rules on platform manipulation and spam. Its success at going viral on Twitter had attracted hundreds of thousands of followers, including MPs and government ministers. One of the UK’s most prominent conspiracy theorists, Icke was banned in 2020 for violating policies on coronavirus misinformation. The former BBC presenter had made numerous unfounded claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including a discredited theory that it was linked to the rollout of the 5G mobile network. The British rightwing commentator’s account was permanently suspended in 2020 for violating the platform’s “hateful conduct” policy. Hopkins, who had more than 1.1 million followers, was removed to “keep Twitter safe”, according to the company. Her historic comments had included comparing migrants to cockroaches and claiming the photograph of a dead Syrian boy lying on a beach, which had sparked a wave of compassion across Europe, was staged. The US independent journalist was banned for violating the site’s coronavirus misinformation rules. He has subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter seeking his reinstatement. The account of the former Trump adviser was suspended in 2020 after he called for the beheading of Dr Anthony Fauci, a key figure in the US government battle against Covid-19, and the FBI director, Christopher Wray. He also called for the posting of their heads outside the White House as a “warning”. The former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard had his account permanently suspended in 2020 due to repeated violations of Twitter rules on hateful conduct. Twitter’s decision to permanently ban Duke came more than a decade after he created his account, in 2009, and more than eight years after he started posting regularly, in 2012.",News/Technology,Banned from Twitter: accounts that may be reprieved after Musk takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/26/banned-from-twitter-accounts-reprieve-elon-musk
4/27/2022,"Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, has said the west was gearing up to help Ukraine for “the long haul” and would take steps to boost rearmament to help the embattled country following a meeting of defence ministers in Germany. Politicians present also discussed coordinating future arms supplies on top of $5bn (£3.9bn) already committed, but the growing effort has already prompted Russia to accuse the west of engaging in “a proxy war” by arming Ukraine against Moscow. “We have an important session today on the long term support for Ukraine’s defence including what that will take from our defence industrial bases,” Austin said after a 40-country meeting at the Ramstein air base in south-west Germany. The secretary added that that would mean “dealing with the tremendous demand that we’re facing for munitions and weapons platforms” and “redoubling our common efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s military for the long haul”. Western allies have been stepping up their arms supply to Ukraine, in response to pleas from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to turn the tide in the fighting, leading to escalating Russian criticism as the war continues. Late on Monday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused Nato of being “engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy” in response to a question about whether the current situation could be compared to the Cuban missile crisis that nearly caused a nuclear war. In response, Austin said on Tuesday that both Ukraine and the west would “do everything in our power” to ensure the war does not “spin out of control”. He added: “Bluster about the use of nuclear, the possible use of nuclear weapons is very dangerous and unhelpful. Nobody wants to see a nuclear war, nobody can win it.” A key ally of President Vladimir Putin, Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s security council, on Tuesday said the outcome of “the policies of the west and the Kyiv regime controlled by it would only be the breakup of Ukraine into several states” – an apparent attempt to blame the west for supporting the Zelenskiy government. At the western conference, Germany promised it would send approximately 50 refurbished Gepard anti-aircraft missile launchers, leading to praise from the Pentagon chief after weeks of pressure on Berlin to step up its supply of heavy weaponry. It was “a major decision” said Austin. “I think those systems will provide real capability to, for Ukraine,” he said, and added he believed the country’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, would “continue to look for ways to be relevant and provide the good capability to the Ukrainians”. Britain pledged a day earlier to send “a small number” of Stormer vehicles which carry Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles – while Canada said at the conference it would send eight armoured vehicles to help Ukraine. But there was no announcement of any commitment to send tanks. Although Nato has repeatedly said it will not enter the war to fight against Russia, western politicians have begun to say their goal is help Ukraine decisively defeat to its neighbour, so that it cannot threaten Kyiv or other neighbours. Earlier this week Austin said that Russia should be “weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine” and when asked again about that statement on Tuesday, he offered a similar formulation. “We would like to make sure again, they don’t have the same type of capability to bully their neighbours that we saw at the outset of this conflict,” he said, highlighting that Russia’s “land forces have been attrited in a very significant way, casualties are pretty substantial, they’ve lost a lot of equipment.” Prior to the meeting, the US said that the total value of arms donated to Ukraine was $5bn, with the US accounting for $3.7bn. On Monday, the UK said it had already sent £200m worth of arms and had a budget to supply £500m if needed.",News/World news,"West gearing up to help Ukraine for ‘long haul’, says US defence secretary",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/west-gearing-up-to-help-ukraine-for-long-haul-says-us-defence-secretary
4/27/2022,"President Joe Biden’s administration is striving to expand availability of the life-saving coronavirus antiviral treatment Paxlovid, and it is simultaneously seeking to reassure doctors that there is ample supply for people at high risk of severe illness or death from the virus. The Food and Drug Administration first approved Paxlovid, produced by Pfizer, for emergency use in December. Supply of the regimen was initially very limited, but as Covid-19 cases across the country have fallen and manufacturing has increased, it is now far more abundant. The White House is now moving to raise awareness of the pill and its availability, as well as making it easier to access. The White House said Tuesday it is increasingly reaching out to doctors and announced that the drug will now be shipped directly to pharmacies, in addition to existing distribution channels run by states. That is expected to increase the number of sites from 20,000 to more than 30,000 next week and eventually to 40,000 locations. However, according to a senior Biden administration official speaking anonymously to Axios, many states are ordering just two-thirds of what is available to them and are using half their orders. Providers are probably limiting access to the pill because “we’ve had the experience in this pandemic before of operating in a scarcity mindset,” another administration official said in a press conference. Many states have opted for a lottery system to allocate Paxlovid and other Covid-19 drugs, often choosing to distribute the drugs to retail pharmacies instead of hospitals and clinics. According to Dr Douglas White, a University of Pittsburgh critical care doctor who helped design Pennsylvania’s lottery system for Covid-19 drug allocation, the system ends up favoring people who are not only aware of the drugs but have access to doctors to prescribe it and the ability to locate pharmacies that have them in stock. “The wealthy and well-connected will win the race,” White told the Los Angeles Times. It’s “the poster child for an unfair system.” Despite the administration’s attempt to reassure providers that there are enough pills for patients, in an interview with NPR on Monday, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, said that there are only enough pills “for the short run.” As of Tuesday, the US had ordered enough supply of the pills for 20 million people, which is estimated to last for several more months. “Right now, we’ve done a really good job of acquiring pills,” Jha said, adding that the Biden administration will need additional funding from Congress to acquire more pills. “We have to make sure that this is more than a short-term solution.” Jha warned that the US will be running out of money for Paxlovid “reasonably soon,” and that “we actually aren’t even going to be able to pay our bills for what we’ve already entered into a contract with Pfizer for, so that’s going to be a problem.” The Biden administration is expected to renew its request to Congress for $22bn in Covid-19 funding. Paxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. About 350 Americans are now dying each day from Covid-19, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year. The FDA authorized Pfizer’s drug for emergency use in adults and children age 12 or older with a positive Covid-19 test and early symptoms who face the highest risk of severe outcomes. That includes older people and those with conditions like obesity and heart disease, though the drug is not recommended for patients with severe kidney or liver problems. The administration is also working to expand the number of “test-to-treat” sites that provide a one-stop shop for those with Covid-19 to get tested for the virus, consult with a medical professional if they’re positive and fill a prescription for Paxlovid on site. There are now 2,200 such locations nationwide, though the administration hopes more sites come online in the next several weeks with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and pharmacy companies.

4/27/2022,"Elon Musk’s $44bn (£35bn) takeover of Twitter could lead to multimillion-dollar payouts for its co-founder Jack Dorsey, along with key executives and board members, while staff could also share a $1bn windfall if stock options pay out. A regulatory filing dated 12 April, submitted ahead of the company’s annual meeting in May and after Musk’s raid on the company’s shares, discloses the major stock-holders and their stakes. Twitter’s co-founder is in line to collect almost $1bn in cash once the deal goes through. Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive last year after pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, still owns 18m shares, or almost 2.4% of its stock, worth $978m at Musk’s agreed offer of $54.20. Other board members hold shares too, and would collect smaller amounts. Dotcom pioneer Martha Lane Fox is a director, and her 32,545 shares would be worth $1.7m (or £1.4m), while Robert Zoellick, the former US deputy secretary of state and ex-president of the World Bank, would get $1.1m. Twitter’s former executive chairman, Omid Kordestani, would receive over $50m, based on his holding of 934,247 shares. Current chair Bret Taylor’s stake would be worth around $3m at Musk’s price. Several Twitter executives, including Dorsey’s successor, Parag Agrawal, would collect payouts if Musk ends their employment, triggering the accelerated vesting of shares awarded as restricted stock units (a form of compensation and performance-related pay popular in Silicon Valley). Agrawal would receive a $38.7m package if his tenure ends through a change in control (CiC) event, such as the company being taken private, a proxy statement filed this month with the SEC shows. Ned Segal, Twitter’s chief financial officer, would receive a $25.5m payoff if his position was terminated though a CiC, while general council Vijaya Gadde would be in line for $12.5m and the chief customer officer, Sarah Personette, would receive $11.2m. Agrawal also owns around 128,000 Twitter shares, including some exercisable and vested stock options, the proxy filing shows, which would be worth nearly $7m at Musk’s offer, while Segal’s 394,000 shares would be worth $21m. Gadde’s 600,000 shares would be valued at $32m, and Personette’s 143,000 would be worth more than $7m. Twitter’s employees have benefitted from a generous share scheme, introduced in 2013, taking as much as 50% of their earnings in stock options. Around 41.7m shares can be issued in options, warrants and rights under Twitter’s equity compensation plans. Those securities would be worth over $2.2bn at Musk’s price. But they have an average exercise price of around $27, indicating they could deliver a profit of $1bn if exercised and then cashed in at $54.20. As well as receiving shares as options vest, staff have been able to buy Twitter stock at a 15% discount, through its employee stock purchase plan. In 2021 they bought 2.2m shares at an average price of $31, for example, which would be worth a $50m profit at Musk’s offer price. ​Also, around 1.5 million shares in unvested restricted common stock is held by Twitter employees who joined the company through acquisitions. Nonetheless, many now fear Musk’s acquisition will mean missing out on the long-term value of stock they hold. During the peak of last year’s tech stock rally, Twitter shares reached the $70 range, significantly above the current offer price, before falling back amid concerns about a global economic downturn. According to the New York Times, executives have tried to assure employees that they wouldn’t be shortchanged, with Agrawal telling them their stock options would convert to cash when the deal closes. Investment giant Vanguard Group, which was just ahead of Musk as Twitter’s biggest shareholder in mid-April, would receive around $4.5bn for its 10% stake held by its various funds, such as index trackers and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Morgan Stanley Investment Management is the third-largest shareholder with 8.5%, worth $3.5bn, followed by BlackRock and State Street who each own 4.75%, or $2bn at Musk’s price.",News/Business,The Twitter shareholders set to make millions from Elon Musk’s takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/the-twitter-shareholders-who-stand-to-gain-from-elon-musks-takeover
4/27/2022,"Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor, took a small step in the right direction by promising to get rid of non-domiciled tax status. This announcement – ahead of local elections – had three prongs. First, it helps rally Labour’s traditional voters who see very rich people benefit while they struggle with tax rises and the cost of living crisis. Second, the pledge refocuses voters’ attention on Ms Reeves’ political opponents such as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, whose wife avoided paying up to £20m in UK tax as a non-dom; and Sajid Javid, the health secretary, who held non-dom status for six years while a banker. Third, it provides evidence that Ms Reeves’ review of taxation might be more radical than previously imagined. The worry is that there may be less to the plan than meets the eye. Britain should scrap the exemption, an archaic legacy of empire in which benefits are largely determined by paternal lineage. Non-doms don’t pay tax in Britain on income generated abroad. Yet Ms Reeves plans to replace this perk with a “temporary resident tax regime” similar to that in countries including France, Germany and Canada. Labour says that it would consult on its proposals but aims to offer tax advantages to such residents for five years, compared with up to 15 years under the current system. Such proposals are not new. As Labour leader, Ed Miliband proposed a similar exemption to avoid deterring talented foreigners. The tax rule has for a decade been a symbol of privilege for the wealthy. In 2008, Gordon Brown introduced a £30,000 annual charge on non-doms. The Tories increased this in 2015 for longer-term residents. These sums won’t bother the very rich, who are much more likely to make use of non-dom status. Some wealthy people may leave if Ms Reeves makes good on her promises. But most non-doms don’t come to Britain for the tax breaks; the rule of law, private schooling and culture are bigger draws. Many choose to stay on in Britain after their non-dom status has ended. Most are workers: about 80% of non-doms sell their labour, rather than living off income from investments. Ms Reeves should be braver. Inequality in Britain is inextricably linked to the rise of finance in the economy. A recent report by the London School of Economics and the University of Warwick found that one in five bankers had claimed non-dom status. Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that the total wage income received by the top 0.1% in 2018-19 was £37bn, and 44% of these people worked in financial services. Nearly a third of the 0.1% were born abroad. The global nature of finance means that foreign bankers coming to London can substantially benefit via non-dom status. But people who can afford to pay tax and enjoy the benefits that Britain provides ought to contribute. Letting the wealthy pay a tiny fraction of their earnings to avoid UK tax while ordinary people face a rising burden is unjust. Labour should end – rather than just limit – non-dom status, which permits one rule for rich and another for everyone else.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Labour’s non-dom plan: end this unjust tax perk | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/26/the-guardian-view-on-labours-non-dom-plan-end-this-unjust-tax-perk
4/27/2022,"Elon Musk’s public description of how he plans to run the Twitter show could currently be transcribed in fewer than 280 characters, so it’s not surprising that everybody, from EU commissioners down, is fretting about what happens when a maverick billionaire gets the controls of a divisive social media site. The overlooked constituency in the excitement, however, is the shareholders in Tesla, Musk’s electric car company that has a better chance of making a positive contribution to civilisation. Its stock slumped 10% in early trading on Tuesday as the market digested the meaning of the boss’s latest adventure. One obvious risk is sales of Tesla stock by Musk to fund the $21bn equity portion of the $43bn Twitter takeover package. Another is spill-over political effects, in the US and elsewhere. Jeff Bezos, another tech tycoon turned media owner, referenced the latter mischievously. “Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?” Tweeted Amazon’s founder. It’s a good question because Bezos’s line of thinking is easy to follow. Twitter is blocked in China because the social media company, rightly, refuses to bow to Beijing’s security laws on what can be said about, say, the strangulation of democracy in Hong Kong or the persecution of Uyghur Muslims. But Musk, wearing his Tesla hat, is a beneficiary of Chinese largesse in the form of financial incentives to build cars in China. Rich Chinese consumers are also big buyers of Teslas and key kit for the batteries comes from the country. What would happen if Beijing were to suggest that Twitter might wish to give the Chinese Communist party an easier ride in the interest of smooth commercial relationships for Tesla? Chinese officialdom, one suspects, won’t distinguish between Musk’s ownership of Twitter (100%, if everything proceeds) and that of Tesla (17% currently). Bezos’s answer to his own question was that “the more likely outcome in this regard is complexity in China for Tesla, rather than censorship at Twitter”. The first part of that guess should still sound scary to the car company’s shareholders. In extremis, would a “free speech absolutist”, as Musk describes himself, be prepared to close factories rather than concede an inch to Chinese bullies? Tensions probably won’t escalate to that degree, but the potential for hassle and expense over time is clear. A high-profile private obsession (Twitter) sits uncomfortably with a $1tn public company with duties to outside shareholders (Tesla). Bezos, as owner of the Washington Post, weathered Donald Trump’s jibes by ignoring them, but that’s possible in the US. A globally freewheeling Twitter is in a different place. Tesla’s shareholders don’t have a voice in the Twitter deal, and it’s safe to assume that the Musk fan club that is the company’s non-executive directors won’t provide a squeak of protest. But, by rights, the Tesla brigade should hate the new deal. At best, it is a distraction for them; at worst, it is a real business risk. FTSE 100 fund manager Schroders is unwinding its two-tier share structure on the grounds that it is “anachronistic”, a description that could have applied at any point in the last quarter of a century. Indeed, the set-up – two classes of shares, only one of which carries voting rights – was becoming out of tune with the times even on the day it was introduced in 1986 as a way to shovel a few shares to staff without diluting the Schroder family’s control. Equal rights for equal economic risk is an excellent principle, then as now. The family has 47.9% of the voting stock and 20.4% of the non-voters these days, which will shake out as 43% control upon enfranchisement. The mechanics of the shuffle don’t appear contentious since the three-for-17 bonus issue to holders of the voting shares merely reflects the relative valuations at which the two classes have tended to trade in recent years. It’s really a case of: what took so long? The tale, let’s hope, is noted by UK technology founders floating their companies in London. City grandee Jonathan Hill’s review of listing rules last year gave them a green light to adopt US-style enhanced voting rights and golden shares as long as time limits apply, but that doesn’t mean the option has to be taken up. If even ancient Schroders can finally align with governance norms, read the breezes.",News/Business,Tesla shareholders are forgotten constituent in Elon Musk’s Twitter deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/26/tesla-shareholders-elon-musk-twitter-deal
4/27/2022,"Students are being incentivised to cheat at university by commercial essay mills offering buy-one-get-one-free deals, loyalty schemes and high street-style cashback offers, a conference has been told. Experts warned of a growing “normalisation” of cheating in higher education, with the shift to online assessment that began during the pandemic making it easier and more common for students to seek outside help. They also warned about the growing availability of AI essay writing tools, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated, offering students yet more opportunities for cheating to try to boost their grades. The government is introducing legislation to ban essay mills and advertising for them, but experts fear there will be few prosecutions, as most are based overseas and therefore beyond the reach of the legislation. It will only apply to England initially, with some limited application in Wales. The Westminster Higher Education Forum virtual conference on Tuesday heard that essay mills – which sell essays or material written to a student’s commission – were now using comparison websites as part of an increasing marketisation of their services. Michael Draper, professor in legal education at the University of Swansea and an expert on academic integrity and cheating, said: “The last count I think there were over a thousand sites on one comparison site, with more arriving each month. That is a huge number. “Increasing commercial pressures of the type that we normally find from supermarkets are impacting on students. So a lot of these sites provide, for example, buy-one-get-one-free or loyalty schemes, or in some cases, I’ve seen cashback.” When students try to withdraw, they can become the victims of blackmail, targeted by fake legal letters. The conference was told this was “organised crime”, with reports that some essay material is provided by authors in sub-Saharan Africa who are also open to exploitation. Draper said students whose school education had been disrupted by the pandemic would be particularly vulnerable as they moved into higher education. “Students increasingly are reporting the pressure they’re feeling, but also impostor syndrome. They just don’t feel ready for the challenges of higher education, learning and assessment and we are going to need to address that,” he said. He also warned that students were unwittingly giving away their own valuable essay material by using free online tools to check spelling or grammar, which can then find its way on to the web where it can be picked up and used – or sold by someone else. Other students have tried to turn a profit themselves by selling their own work, Draper said. “I’ve also seen some ‘entrepreneurial’ activity by students basically selling direct to other students their own material from previous levels. So students themselves are jumping on to this normalisation bandwagon.” The conference was told that collusion, where students work together to complete an assessment that should be taken independently, has become a serious problem in the past couple of years, particularly with the shift of assessment online, which is likely to have played into grade inflation. Tom Yates, director of corporate affairs at the Quality Assurance Agency, the independent body that checks on standards and quality in UK higher education, welcomed the new legislation on essay mills and said it would result in a change in the dynamic that exists for students. “Essentially, students will know that if they use an essay mill they will be engaging with a criminal entity, and we can’t claim that’s been the case hitherto, and that should remove the temptation for many,” he said.",News/Education,"Essay mills offering incentives to cheating students, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/26/essay-mills-offering-incentives-to-cheating-university-students-experts-warn
4/27/2022,"More than 120 legal, health and social services organisations have appealed to the federal government to provide urgent assistance to Aboriginal families left with no way to pay for their funerals, after their “predatory” insurer went into liquidation. “This is one of the worst financial scandals we’ve ever seen,” they say in an open letter to both major political parties, after reports that Aboriginal families have been forced to leave the bodies of their loved ones in the morgue while they raise the money to pay for a funeral. Youpla Group, previously known as the Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (ACBF), was a Gold Coast-based private business that for decades allegedly aggressively sold funeral insurance almost exclusively to Aboriginal people, including children and babies. When Youpla collapsed in March, its member contributions totalled $39.2m, according to the liquidator, who warned there was just $11.9m left. More than 13,000 low-income Aboriginal people face losing all they have paid into the fund. The Save Sorry Business coalition – which includes the consumer advocate Choice, the Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss), Anglicare and dozens of other non-government organisations – now wants the federal government to provide urgent assistance to families who need to pay for funerals, and policy holders who are “in the final stages of their lives”. “People have paid for funeral cover to ensure their families can carry out Sorry Business and grieve together — not to be left with the challenges of intergenerational debt and hardship,” the group says. State and federal governments have known for almost 30 years about Youpla’s “misleading” conduct and “did nothing to prevent it”, the coalition says. “The harm created by Youpla is squarely a result of an inadequate regulatory framework. The harm created by Youpla should never have been allowed to continue,” they say. Kuku Yalanji elder Daphne Naden signed up to the fund in the mid-1990s for herself and her four daughters, who were young children at the time. Naden, who is from Mossman in far north Queensland, has lost more than $15,000. Now, at age 65, she is worried about handing on a debt to her family. “I’m 66 this year and I’ve got some health problems, but I don’t want to leave my family to have to come up with all the funds,” said Naden, a director at the Indigenous Consumer Assistance Network. Naden said she trusted Youpla because they gave the appearance of being an Aboriginal-run community organisation. “The idea of having a funeral fund for Aboriginal communities was something that I really took to, and thought was a good idea,” she said. “I had my four daughters who were very young children at that time. I thought it’d be good, just in case, to have them covered. “I was committed to something that I thought gave me peace of mind. And then I turned around and found out there’s no peace of mind whatsoever.” Labor says if it wins government it will establish an inquiry to look into the role played by Youpla’s directors and the bodies that regulated them – the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and NSW Fair Trading. The party says it wrote to the government in 2019 warning that Aboriginal families would be “ripped off twice” if Youpla collapsed. The government did not respond to the letter, the shadow assistant treasurer Stephen Jones said. “Clearly, whoever wins the next election is going to have to deal with this issue, and face up to the fact that the government has been negligent,” Jones said. However, the Coalition says it “finally put a stop to ACBF and their predatory behaviour” following the banking royal commission. “My first priority is that the people responsible are held accountable,” the financial services minister Jane Hume said. “To this end, ASIC is taking legal action against ACBF alleging misleading and deceptive conduct. “Secondly, I want to make sure that the people affected are aware of the help available across the country. No Australian will be left unable to bury their loved one with dignity.” The Coalition has suggested there are state-based organisations that can help meet funeral and burial costs. The Australian Financial Complaints Authority has received more than 700 complaints against Youpla since 2018, and issued 178 decisions against the group for “misleading and deceptive conduct”. Meanwhile, community organisations and financial counsellors say they have been “inundated” with hundreds of calls a day since the collapse. “There are no legal options here which would help get back their money or even pay for their funeral,” said Mark Holden, a Dunghutti man and solicitor at Mob Strong Debt Help. “It is especially hard talking to Elders who have given so much of themselves to community. They deserve a dignified farewell in accordance to Sorry Business protocols.” ",News/Australia news,Government under pressure to help Aboriginal families after ‘predatory’ funeral insurer’s collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/government-under-pressure-to-help-aboriginal-families-after-predatory-funeral-insurers-collapse
4/27/2022,"As both a fruiter and builder, Anthony Todarello can reel off more goods that have soared in price in the past year than most people. His family has run the Hampton Fruit Centre, an institution in Melbourne’s Bayside suburb, for six decades. Todarello blames wild weather for pushing up the cost of produce at a pace rarely seen before. “Everything’s late in being planted, with the rain [in eastern Australia] just wiping out crops, pretty much,” he said. “There is a real scarcity of supply, irrespective of the scarcity of labour.” While cucumbers, tomatoes, and capsicums are among produce posting big increases, it’s the $20-a-kg green beans that stands out for him. “We’ve never sold beans that expensive,” Todarello said. “By the time we buy, transport them here and [add the cost of] the labour, the cost is probably $17 a kilo, so there’s not much margin really at all. It’s pretty hard at the moment for everyone.” Food prices will feature prominently when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases the March quarter consumer price inflation figures on Wednesday. The so-called headline rate is set to come in at about 4.5%, not far shy of the 5% pace last reached in 2008. The Commonwealth bank predicts food prices alone will have nearly doubled the pace of increases in the first three months of 2022 from the December quarter rising 1.3%. Petrol prices, which spiked with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rose almost 10% in the quarter and remain elevated, even with the 22.1 cents a litre temporary cut in the fuel excise. Another consequence of rising prices is that the Reserve Bank is running out of excuses not to lift the official cash rate target from its record low 0.1% level. Other central banks, such as in New Zealand, the UK and the US, have already acted, and Australia’s first increase in more than a decade won’t be far off unless the CPI comes in surprisingly low. Markets have been raising the odds of a 3 May rise, although bank economists are, for now, mostly tipping the first move will be in June. While investors aren't yet certain about an RBA rate rise on May 3rd, the odds have lately been mounting... #auspol #AusVotes2022 #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/k8ON46zxrf While supplying food is “an essential service” for Todarello, he’s “put everything on hold for a while” in his construction business as the cost of supplies in that industry have also taken off. Timber is in short supply while steel from Steelcon, a long-term provider, has roughly doubled in the past year. “It was about $1,300 and something [a tonne] and it’s now … $2,600,” he said. “And they can’t commit to that price.” The squeeze is particularly hurting builders of large numbers of houses, with some opting to put in clauses to break contracts rather than wear ballooning losses. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “A townhouse project, which may have cost – for the sake of the argument – $1.5m for two townhouses [is] probably going to cost you close to $2m now,” Todarello said. Banks, meanwhile, are already pushing up fixed-rate loans in expectation of their own higher costs of borrowing. “Twelve months ago, no one would have predicted fixed rates would soar this high this fast, particularly when the RBA was predicting the cash rate would not move north until at least 2024,” Sally Tindall, the research director of RateCity.com.au, said. NAB, for instance, has hiked some fixed rates almost 3 percentage points in the last year. Its four-year mortgage rate has gone from 1.98% to 4.49%, the data group said. Household power bills will also be increasing as rising coal and gas costs for generators lift wholesale tariffs. Underdone in the political campaign is power prices.

The underlying rate, which strips out volatile items and is what the RBA most acutely watches, will be 3.1%, she said. Ell notes that while the RBA has said it wants to see wages rise more before lifting rates, its officials have also been stressing the wage price index – next due out on 18 May for the March quarter – doesn’t pick up all of the increase. One reason is that more people are switching jobs, garnering higher pay in the process, she said. Pandemic-related shortages have also added to price pressures, including from the latest lockdowns in China, where the government continues to pursue a zero Covid policy. The most recent closures, such as in Shanghai and now Beijing, will elevate prices this quarter and later, with increases hinging on how much production and transport are affected. The effects for Australia include not just falling prices for iron ore and other commodities, but also a delay in the recovery of the country’s service sector. “We’re not expecting to see a strong resurgence in, say, arrivals from China,” Ell said, removing some of the biggest spenders. “It was expected that this year, particularly in the first half, that we would see that kind of besieged service sector really starting to pick up.” Some short-term relief will land as the Morrison government’s $250 cost of living payments start going out from Wednesday, handily coinciding politically with the CPI release. By the end of the week, 6 million eligible Australian pensioners, welfare recipients, veterans and concession card holders will receive $1.5bn in total. Todarello, though, predicts fruit and vegetable prices will remain high for months to come because above-average rains in growing areas don’t appear to be over. Ell, too, points to the likelihood of higher fuel prices once the six-month excise cut ends. “There’s a lot of pressure that’s going to come on to the household sector over the next year,” Ell said.",News/Business,Consumer inflation tipped to hit 4.5% in March as Australian cost of living soars,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/consumer-inflation-tipped-to-hit-45-in-march-as-australian-cost-of-living-soars
4/27/2022,"“What is the hardest question a patient has asked you?” a medical student wonders on a ward round of dozens of patients with every manner of concern. She has just heard a few cancer patients ask if treatment will extend their lives. A proper conversation about the goals of care and what to expect is one of the most rewarding in medicine. Then there are questions about novel items in a fast-paced world. Did I catch the news about the wonder drug in mice? What do I think about the latest clinical trial? Is the new treatment better than the old? Patients don’t mind hearing, “I don’t know” provided it is followed by, “but I will find out.” They worry when “I don’t know” sounds like “I don’t care”. Other hard questions in medicine involve judgment. Defining futile care. Avoiding vexatious colleagues. Challenging the culture. It can be difficult grappling with these questions when there is no one “right thing” to do. But these, too, one learns to navigate. The question that I really struggle with is one of staggering simplicity and yet upsetting like few others. “Doctor, can I drink water?” An elderly man looks eagerly at the drinks trolley. Affected by consecutive strokes, his limbs are weak. His face droops and his voice slurs somewhat although, if you focus, you can make out his words. After his wife’s death, his health has taken a downturn and his days are sedentary. The first stroke gave him an unsteady gait but he still enjoyed reading and sipping tea. A second stroke put him in a facility and led to a swallowing assessment that dictated a pureed diet and thickened fluids. When he protested, he was told that any instructions to alter his diet must be approved by a doctor. The residential care doctor refused, warning that thin fluids risked causing aspiration pneumonia. Now he has presented with an infection. When his children visit, he can’t sustain conversation, and everyone concedes that he is deteriorating. In a rare coincidence, he is awake during my rounds. When I ask how we can make him comfortable, he responds by becoming animated and asking for a glass of water. “Sure,” I say, thinking that it is the least of wishes to fulfil. “He is not allowed,” his nurse interrupts, pointing to the sign above his bed. Whispering a quiet aside to the nurse, the resident gets a cup of water and a straw. We raise the head of the bed, explain the risks to the plainly excited patient, and hold the straw to his lips. He takes a long drink and immediately starts coughing. He slows down and sips again. Satisfaction illuminates his face. Using his good hand to grasp mine, he proclaims this first drink of water in two years as the best medicine of all. I note the glaring irony, considering the cost of hospitalisation in the tens of thousands of dollars. “Don’t stop my water,” he begs before falling asleep from the happy exertion. We pull down the sign and note that the patient, nearing the end of life, can drink water “at risk”. There is no strong evidence that banning thin fluids limits the risk of aspiration pneumonia, since patients can still aspirate on their secretions. But there is evidence that thickened water is a poor substitute for water – the thickening agent can leave a problematic residue and patients can become dehydrated because of the reluctance to drink something that’s promoted as the consistency of “nectar” but feels more like a tub of lubricant. Speech pathologists are experts who emphasise that their advice should be considered in the context of the whole patient, but this patient’s assessment unwittingly creates a storm. When it smells dispute, medicine slows right down. Every day my team tries to honour the patient’s autonomy and is forced to live the adage, “There’s many a slip between the cup and the lip.” Up to 30% of nursing home residents are prescribed thickened fluids and, once in place, the order often stays. But if “at-risk” patients are allowed to drink water (as most want), the next question is, “What happens if they aspirate?” This requires an honest discussion about the futility of treating recurrent aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics and hospitalisation and allowing people to make an informed choice. I have once been deprived of water while awaiting surgery that kept getting pushed back – I found this “routine” precaution the most distressing aspect of the experience. I am not surprised that a study found that patients would be willing to trade off five years of a 10-year life expectancy to be allowed to drink water. The standoff surrounding our patient took a week to resolve but, happily, he returned to residential care drinking water as his heart desired in the weeks before he died. In February a palliative care physician appealed on Twitter that when a dying patient requests a drink, “Don’t thicken it. Make sure he gets what he wants. Don’t ask anybody. It won’t take long. Go get it by yourself.” When a patient requests to drink cold ice water before removing high-flow nasal cannula (to withdraw life support), that will be the last one in his life.- Don't thicken it.- Make sure he gets what he wants.- Don't ask anybody. It won't take long. Go get it by yourself. Such simple, respectful medical practice should scarcely need urging when the buzzword in health is patient-centred care. We still have far to go for the practice of medicine to remain in touch with the most human of wants even as we chase after more glittering goals.",Opinion/Opinion,"‘Doctor, can I drink water?’ – why the simplest of questions can be the most upsetting | Ranjana Srivastava",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/27/doctor-can-i-drink-water-why-the-simplest-of-questions-can-be-the-most-upsetting
4/27/2022,"Locals say a proposal to carry out logging in a state forest on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast will leave long-lasting scars on the area and are fearful of the effect it will have on threatened species. The state government has proposed to log selected trees in a section of the Beerwah State Forest, known locally as Ferny Forest, before it ends native timber production in the “high value” conservation area in two years. Sunshine Coast residents fear chopping down parts of the forest, in areas deemed core koala habitat, could have disastrous consequences. “It’s home to koalas, which have been listed as endangered, as well as glossy black cockatoos and greater gliders,” said Wendy Merefield-Ward, a member of Save Ferny Forest. “It’s like we’re all fighting over the scraps of what’s left after agriculture, after mining, and after logging activities.” According to the government proposal, “selective” hardwood natives like blackbutt, white stringybark, turpentine and grey gum will be cut down some time in 2022, with the timber to be used for power poles, sawlogs, girders and landscaping logs. Narelle McCarthy, a spokesperson of the Sunshine Coast environment council, said the group opposed any harvesting of the forest – which is one of the few remaining coastal rainforests in the region. “The Sunshine Coast is experiencing incredible urbanisation and … it’s putting extreme pressure on our conservation areas,” McCarthy said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The forest is really important to our region’s biodiversity and I think there will be some legacy impacts from it.” A Department of Agriculture and Fisheries spokesperson said “no final decision has been made on the proposed harvest”. The spokesperson said the department has a “comprehensive process in place to identify and protect koalas during any timber harvesting operations, including the use of koala spotters and koala detection dogs.” “The proposed harvesting operations would be the final selective harvest of this area, consistent with the Queensland government’s native timber action plan,” the spokesperson said. The southeast Queensland forests agreement to end logging in the region by 31 December 2024 was signed by the state government, the timber industry and the conservation sector in 1999. As part of the agreement, about 50% of the 130-hectare Ferny Forest section was considered as an area for harvest, with the forest last logged in the mid-1990s. A petition to stop logging in the proposed area, located between Steve Irwin Way and Ewen Maddock dam, has received almost 22,000 signatures. McCarthy said Ferny Forest, which adjoins the Mooloolah River national park, is an important piece of bushland for climate resilience, as well as the protection of wildlife. While koala “habitat trees” cannot be harvested under current native timber production codes, McCarthy said logging of other trees could cause disturbances and result in further fragmentation of the endangered species. McCarthy said many celebrated national parks and conservation areas in the area were very hard fought. “We really want to see those areas expanded and Ferny represents one such opportunity,” she says.",News/Australia news,Community groups angered as Queensland government proposes logging in state forest,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/community-groups-angered-as-queensland-government-proposes-logging-in-state-forest
4/27/2022,"You probably know Mary Coustas best as Effie, the outrageous second-generation Greek Australian who delighted 90s audiences in TV shows like Acropolis Now. But when Coustas next gets on stage, it won’t be as that iconic character. In a run of shows for the Sydney Opera House in late May, the longtime performer will be shedding her Effie armour and doing something far more daunting – speaking about her real life as Mary. The show, fittingly, is called This Is Personal. Finally putting it on is a dream realised for Coustas. “In the wings of my mind, I’ve had this show that I’ve always wanted to do that I was too afraid to do,” she says. “I’ve always had accents and wigs and characters. Like, how much can I disguise myself while I become somebody else? But I knew there was a point where I would have to just strip all that back and get to the core of me without the bells and the whistles.” This Is Personal is an exploration of love, laughter and fear that Coustas describes as a “drama with laughs”. Her experience of growing up in a migrant household will form part of the show, as will her experience of motherhood. But despite her European roots, Coustas didn’t actually travel to Greece as an adult until her late 30s. When she eventually did make the trip, Coustas was given a collection of jewellery from her extended family that she now treasures. Here, she tells us why she’d save that trove of yellow gold in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. A jewellery collection. I was gifted a lot of jewellery when I first met my relatives in Greece, because I didn’t meet them until I was in my late 30s. I’d been as a child but I didn’t go back again as an adult until a documentary I was filming took me there. I’d been avoiding it because my father had died many years earlier and I just thought, if I go back, it’ll bring everything up – because he spoke with his village, which was very beautiful, every day. My mum had gone, my brother had gone, but I wouldn’t go to Greece. Then I got convinced to go to Greece for that documentary and I fell in love with it. I have no blood relatives in Australia, except for a mother and a brother. But my grandmother, all my cousins and my aunties and uncles were all there. I fell in love with them and that changed everything for me. And as their way of showing their love towards me, they gave me this jewellery. Greeks have the most beautiful yellow gold. It’s just beautiful stuff. My daughter’s obsessed with it all now too. Sometimes she’ll say, can we have a look at your jewellery? It’s all from Greece, and each one of these pieces is from someone I love, so I would grab that in a fire before anything else. This is so funny because Greeks love a hose. They love hosing and there’s always jokes about it, because it’s true. They love concrete because they get to hose it. And I truly love nothing more than my power hose. It’s a big electrical hose. I mean, if you ever want to see cleaning porn, just look for the before and after shots of someone using an electrical hose. So if someone was going to paint the exterior of a building, a professional painter would bring an electrical power hose and wash it first, to get all the dirt off. That’s how I discovered them – I got my house painted. The guy bought this electrical hose and started cleaning the exterior of the house and it was like one of those ads where you think you’re being had. The walls went from grey to stark white. I said oh my god, how do I get one of these? He told me to go to Bunnings. It set me back a couple of hundred bucks and it’s the best thing I’ve ever bought. I’m obsessed with it. I know it sounds really ridiculous but it’s sort of an antidepressant. Like, you think you have achieved the most miraculous feat when you get that power hose on. I’m not the type of person that loses much. My daughter did a show and tell and for the tell bit, she said, three times a week my daddy thinks he loses his wallet but three times a week my mum finds it. But I’ve sold things that I wish I hadn’t. I bought a rare sports car when I just finished uni. My dad said to me at the time, you didn’t buy a car, you bought a box of matches. It was that small. It was a Honda S800, and it was brought out to rival the MG. It was tiny. I thought I’d lost my car every time I went to a nightclub – I’d come out and I think, oh my god, someone’s stolen it, but it was just parked next to a sedan. It looked like the sort of car you could imagine James Bond getting into in a desperate moment. I stupidly sold it because I had no way to store it, and I really regret it. I was moving to Sydney and I thought, I don’t want to be parking this on the street in Darlinghurst or Potts Point or wherever I was living at the time, because it was rare. But I was doing a corporate gig a couple of years ago at Luna Park, hosting as Effie. A guy came up to me when I sat down and said, I bought your sports car. I’ve still got your number plates with your initials on them and if you want me to, I’ll send them to you. So that was nice. But I do regret selling it because I would have loved driving around in that now. And it’s gone up in value – like, enormously. Plus it was just the most reliable car I’ve ever had. I used it every single day.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Mary Coustas: ‘I truly love nothing more than my power hose’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/27/three-things-with-mary-coustas-i-truly-love-nothing-more-than-my-power-hose
4/27/2022,"Almost 200 New South Wales police officers have been investigated over alleged breaches of the force’s social media policy since the start of 2019, while 10 officers remained under active investigation last month. Documents obtained by the Guardian show breaches of the policy led to disciplinary actions against 66 officers over the same period, with these ranging in severity from counselling to suspension without pay. Four officers have resigned after being found to have breached the code. Last year NSW police reviewed its social media guidelines for the first time since 2015, with the new version published at the start of 2022. Among the documents seen by the Guardian are notes from senior officers working on the updated policy which include references to “significant issues around officers/employees being caught up in chat groups set up on social media and discussing colleagues”. In the new guidelines, officers are warned that offensive comments made about colleagues could be considered cyberbullying, which could result in managerial intervention or criminal charges. The policy says officers need to think about how they would explain a post to their mother and how they would feel if it was tendered in court or splashed on the front page of a newspaper. Some officers have been also been reprimanded and faced “management action” for “accessing and playing games on social media for lengthy periods while on duty”. More than 180 sworn officers had allegations of breaches made against them between January 2019 and March of this year. Of those, 69 allegations were sustained and 10 were under active investigation in March. Of the sworn officers found to have breached the code, 24 were made to attend counselling, four resigned, two were suspended without pay, one was restricted from duties, and others were subjected to training and mentoring or received official warnings. There were investigations into eight unsworn members over the same time – half of which were sustained. Three of the four were reprimanded and another resigned. Examples of breaches by officers were detailed in the new policy including an officer who consented to be photographed with drunk people in an “inappropriate pose” on New Year’s Eve which was then circulated online, leading to formal management action. In another example of what not to do, a photo of a “very intoxicated” police officer wearing a bikini was used in court by a defence lawyer to “damage” the credibility of the officer. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Police are strongly recommended not to identify themselves as members of the force on social media, including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter and dating apps like Bumble and Tinder, and told that if they are able to be identified as serving they are “no longer commenting in a private capacity”. They are warned against commenting on or hinting at matters likely to be before the courts and told not to post any materials that could bring the force “into disrepute” or embarrass the agency. Officers are also warned that they are “increasingly being filmed by the public during operational incidents” and posted on social media sites, leading to people seeking to identify officers “to target and harass”. “Posting photographs of yourself, especially in uniform, or otherwise identifying yourself as a police employee on your personal social media sites, makes you very easy to find,” the guidelines say. Officers are warned not to make public comments on politics or other government agencies. The policy warns that the public affairs branch conducts regular social media searches on the names of some employees attending social media training and are often able to locate and identify the officers. The force’s own social media accounts have grown in popularity over recent years, with more than 1.3 million Facebook followers, 200,000 on Twitter, nearly 300,000 on Instagram and 40,000 on the newly created TikTok account.

4/27/2022,"Soaring rents have dramatically outstripped increases to the commonwealth rent assistance (CRA) payment, with house rentals in capital cities rising by an average of 13.8% over the last two years while rent assistance has risen by a maximum of 4.52%, leaving low-income renters hardest hit by the national rental crisis. The pressure in regional areas is even more severe, with rent increases of 20.2% across the board. Almost half of low-income renters now experience rental stress, spending more than 30% of their income on rent, even with government support. The government’s main response to questions about what it is doing to address the rental crisis has been to point to the supplementary payment made to 1.4 million welfare recipients in private rentals, at a rate of 75 cents in the dollar above a certain amount. As of 20 March this year, the maximum assistance available was $145.80 a fortnight for singles and $193.62 for families, or $72.9 and $96.81 a week respectively. The CRA increases in line with the consumer price index (CPI), an amount tenants’ advocates say is not even enough to buy a cup of coffee. They argue there has been a “lack of empathy” among politicians ahead of the 21 May election for the 32% of Australians who rent, with welfare recipients the most overlooked, despite the rising cost of living being nominated as a critical issue by voters. Social security rates have been indexed on five separate occasions since March 2021, but rent assistance has only increased in that time by a maximum of $5 a fortnight for singles and $6.58 for parents with children, or $2.50 and $3.29 a week respectively. The rent for a three-bedroom house in greater Sydney at the city’s median rent of $550 a week has increased by approximately $67 a week in the past year. For those in a two-bedroom flat currently paying the median of $520, rent has increased by approximately $17 a week. For a dwelling in regional New South Wales at the median house rent of approximately $460, it is an increase of about $77 a week. Alongside rapidly escalating prices, rental availability has also plummeted over the last 12 months, with analysts saying the worst is yet to come and warning of increased rates of homelessness. A productivity commission report, delivered just prior to the pandemic, warned that an ageing population coupled with declining rates of home ownership meant that people eligible for and needing rental assistance would “grow rapidly over the coming decade”. If elected, the Labor party has pledged to establish the Housing Australia Future Fund, the aim of which is to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties over five years. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has said that this increase in housing stock will help ease the pressure on rents. Labor has also flagged that it will develop a national housing and homelessness plan if elected. Housing, homelessness and welfare organisations have been calling for years for the development of a federal strategy on housing, including renters in its scope, to guide the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement (NHHA), which governs how the states and territories spend the $1.6bn in federal funds set aside for housing. Labor has not yet provided detail about how the needs of renters will be addressed through that strategy. On top of that, it has not committed to increasing jobseeker payments and has also dropped plans for a review into the jobseeker rate. The Liberal party’s housing policies have focused on home ownership. When asked about policies specifically targeting renters, a spokesperson for the housing and homelessness minister, Michael Sukkar, said the government’s priority was “getting more people into the housing market through our measures for first homebuyers”, along with increasing housing supply through the New Home Guarantee Scheme and HomeBuilder programs. When asked if a re-elected Coalition government would develop a national housing strategy, Sukkar’s spokesperson said the NHHA itself was the strategy. They also said housing was a matter for state and local governments. “State governments and local councils need to step up and increase the supply of housing to put downward pressure on house prices and rentals,” the spokesperson said. “We strongly encourage states to rethink their prohibitive taxes and regulatory bottlenecks. States must do their own share of the heavy lifting, funded from their own balance sheets.” The chief executive of Tenants Victoria, Jennifer Beveridge, said the needs of renters had been overlooked by the major parties. “There’s a distinct lack of understanding of rental issues and the rental crisis being shown by our politicians in this election campaign,” Beveridge said. “There’s a definite lack of empathy with the younger generation who are giving up on the dream of owning a home. There’s a whole generation expecting to rent for much longer, who are also voters.” Tenants Victoria has joined the Australian Council of Social Services in calling for an increase to the rental assistance payment by 50%, which, at current rates, would lift it to a maximum of $218.70 a fortnight for singles and $290.43 for families. “The CPI increase that came through recently – it’s nothing, it doesn’t even buy you a cup of coffee let alone contribute to skyrocketing rents or help people on low incomes,” Beveridge said. Struggling renters cut across all demographics. Guardian Australia has reported on the plight of sole parents, regional residents who are being pushed out of their own communities or rendered homeless, flood victims, and renters who become ill due to the uninhabitable condition of their homes. Renters with disability also face serious challenges in the current market, according to the chief executive of the Physical Disability Council of NSW, Serena Ovens. She said limited accessible options in housing stock are “a huge barrier” to finding an appropriate home, leaving many to “make do with housing that only partially meets their needs”. “Renters with disability are often automatically discounted over ‘able-bodied’ counterparts as being more problematic – while they are often in fact more likely to be stable, long-term renters,” Ovens said. Leo Patterson Ross from the NSW Tenants Union said there were specific policy levers that could be pulled at a federal level that would materially benefit renters – especially through the NHHA – on issues like no-grounds eviction, as well as in separating financial incentives designed for owner-occupiers from those of investors who buy properties to rent for profit.

We need you to start running your business in a way that doesn’t make your problem worse, and if you want your federal funding, you need to come to the table’,” Patterson Ross said. “We also need to create a property investment expectation that’s much more about stable, reliable, low return and not this high-stakes system we’ve fallen into … This is someone’s home, you’re free to buy and sell but the person in the middle needs to be able to rely on this essential service, and shouldn’t become collateral damage.” A national housing strategy that has bipartisan and multi-jurisdictional commitment is critical to solving the housing crisis, including for renters, advocates said. “If there’s no plan, how can we make things better?” Beveridge said. “There are good ideas but nobody’s standing up and taking leadership on this issue and facilitating change. It appears, in this country, that we’re happy to maintain the status quo and that’s not good enough.”",News/Australia news,Low-income tenants hardest hit as Australian rent rises outstrip assistance payments,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/low-income-tenants-hardest-hit-as-australian-rent-rises-outstrip-assistance-payments
4/27/2022,"Two dates are carved into the wood block marking Erwin Prayoga’s makeshift grave. For passersby on Rote Island, one of Indonesia’s most impoverished regions, the numbers hold no great significance – another boy from a poor family, dead at 16. There is nothing to hint at Erwin’s final anguished years when, confused and far from home, he was arrested on an asylum seeker boat, charged as an adult people-smuggler and sent to a maximum security jail in Western Australia. Nor of his illness while in detention, which persisted after urgent surgery, nor of his sudden deportation back home to a family so disadvantaged they had to cart him in a wheelbarrow to the local clinic when he quickly deteriorated. For the Australian government though, the carvings on Erwin’s headstone are damning. The birthdate – 28 February 1995 – helps confirm a shocking miscarriage of justice spanning law enforcement and government, which caused Erwin to be wrongly incarcerated at the age of 14. Using a trove of internal documents, the Guardian has established how police used a now discredited technique to alter the date of birth Erwin gave them, making him appear an adult and paving the way for his prosecution and imprisonment. Erwin’s brother, Baco Ali, his lawyers Ken Cush & Associates and a team of Indonesian human rights investigators are now demanding answers on the 14-year-old’s medical treatment and the decision to send him home to Rote Island just months before he died. “I know that death is inevitable,” Baco says from his home on Rote Island. “But I want to know what happened to him. I know he had surgery. I want to ask whether they really treated him well before they send him back home. “I want to know why he died.” Three days after Christmas 2009, an Australian surveillance plane was conducting regular patrols across the Indian Ocean. About 35km north of Ashmore Reef, the observers saw a small timber vessel adrift with 10 asylum seekers fleeing Burma on board, and alerted the Australian Navy to intercept. The authorities identified Erwin as crew and detained him. Erwin made it clear he was born in February 1995, making him 14 at the time of his arrest. In separate interviews the asylum seekers said they thought he was no more than 15. The age Erwin gave to police matches not only the date his family carved into his headstone, but also the date on his birth certificate, obtained by the Guardian. Under federal police policy on juvenile people smugglers, he should have been sent home. But police instead relied on a technique to estimate his age which the WA supreme court found, in a separate case in 2017, to have been “completely discredited”. They used an X-ray of Erwin’s wrist to compare his bone maturity to a pool of largely middle-class Americans. “In my opinion the subject of the X-ray had reached skeletal maturity and was therefore probably 19 years or older at 20 January 2010 when the X-ray was taken,” the radiologist’s report found. Police and senior government figures had reason to be wary of the wrist X-ray technique before they used it on Erwin. The federal police had been involved in a case years earlier where they were told it was “not an exact science”, was open to error and that the key reference tool on which it depended should be used with “judicious scepticism”. An internal immigration department briefing from June 2010, four months before Erwin was jailed, directly warned the government about the reliability of using wrist X-rays, pointing to UK guidelines that said it “cannot” be used to determine a person’s age and was “an inexact science” with a “margin of error [that] can sometimes be as much as five years either side”. Erwin was prosecuted regardless and remanded in Perth’s Hakea prison – a maximum security facility housing some of the state’s worst criminals – before being sent five hours away to Albany prison in southern WA. On a sworn prosecution notice seen by the Guardian, police had listed Erwin’s date of birth as 26 February 1991. The year of birth Erwin gave them had been changed from 1995 to 1991, making it consistent with the X-ray report. The day was changed from from 28 Feburary to 26 February. The changes made Erwin 19 years old. Erwin had already been seriously ill while in immigration detention in the Northern Territory. In January 2010 he was rushed to Royal Darwin hospital complaining of abdominal pain. Erwin went into surgery the next day to remove his appendix, medical records show, but two days later was still complaining of feeling “very sore all over from constantly dry retching/nausea”. Internal prison documents show he was doubled over in pain when he arrived at Albany prison 11 months later. “Unable to void [urine] as was told he could not go to the toilet when he requested,” the documents say. “This has happened before and required catheterisation to relieve. Last went to toilet early morning and has drunk approximately 300ml in transit. On examination, tense abdomen on palpation.” The next day, the prison recorded that Erwin was “well with no issues”. After Erwin had spent almost a year on remand in adult jails, his lawyers wrote to commonwealth prosecutors saying their client was still telling them he was a child. “He instructed me that he maintains his position that his date of birth is 26 February 1995 which means he would have been 14 years of age when he was apprehended,” his lawyer said. “I note the court records state that he was born in December 1991 which must have resulted from some falsification of his records prior to entry.” More than three months after that letter, prosecutors withdrew the charges against Erwin. He was released, declared fit to travel and deported to Indonesia not long before Christmas 2011. Erwin was healthy for the first few weeks after he returned home in December 2011, Baco says. The brothers hadn’t spent much time together as kids, at times living on different islands. For Baco, Erwin had always seemed kind and loving, having left school to help the family survive. “I remember when he arrived, we sat in our house with several relatives, and Erwin kept looking at me,” Baco says. “He then asked someone next to him ‘who is that?’, and that person said: ‘That’s your little brother, don’t you remember?’ “That’s how long we’ve been apart. I also couldn’t recognise him at first.” Erwin didn’t say much about what had happened to him in Australia, save to tell Baco a story about their engines failing on the way, leaving the boat stranded. Among the meagre possessions Erwin brought home were photographs of him in a prison uniform. Soon Erwin began to complain about a pain in his abdomen. His family took him in a wheelbarrow to a local health centre and hospital on Rote Island. The pain did not go away. As Erwin deteriorated, his family took him to a bigger hospital in Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara. “I do not remember what the doctor said but I remember they put a catheter through him and I could see greenish looking liquid coming out from his stomach into the catheter bag,” Baco says. Erwin was screaming in pain. “He clenched his fist like he wanted to fight with someone, maybe he wanted to fight that pain. “He told me one time ‘I could endure pain, but this pain is too much for me’.” One morning, around 5am, the screaming finally stopped. Erwin and Baco’s parents were already dead, so it was left to Baco and some other relatives to clean and prepare Erwin’s body. An hour later Baco was on a ferry, his brother’s body next to him, travelling back to Rote Island. Erwin was buried next to his mother’s grave on the island. The family of five now has only two members left, Baco and his younger sister. Baco is still searching for answers about his brother’s death. Some may come from the case of six other children wrongfully jailed as adults, who have just won a remarkable victory to overturn their convictions. That case has revealed the true extent of Australia’s failings. In a judgment published on Tuesday, the WA court of appeal said a “substantial miscarriage of justice” had occurred. The court found that, without the wrist X-ray evidence, all six boys would “not have been charged as an adult”. It said commonwealth prosecutors had now conceded their earlier reliance on the wrist X-rays cast “serious doubt” on the integrity of their case. “The Crown has conceded that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by each of the convictions; the judgments of conviction should be set aside; and judgments of acquittal should be entered,” the court said. “The Crown accepts that there was no reliable evidence when each appellant was convicted and sentenced that he was of or over the age of 18 years.” It comes far too late for Erwin.",News/Australia news,‘I want to know why he died’: family seeks justice over Australia’s jailing of Indonesian child,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/i-want-to-know-why-he-died-family-seeks-justice-over-australias-jailing-of-indonesian-child
4/27/2022,"When Ted Stein was asked by an old school friend if he’d consider modelling for life-drawing classes, it didn’t take long for him to agree. Stein is transgender and never saw gender-diverse bodies when he was at art school. “I realised, how are these bodies going to make it into national art galleries if no one ever gets to draw them?” he says. “I wanted to give back to the art community in the way of representation, and also give back to the trans and queer communities, which are so vibrant and so much a part of my life.” We speak after I’ve spent two hours breaking Stein’s athletic form down into shapes upstairs at the Lord Gladstone hotel in Sydney’s Chippendale – a groovy little pub covered in graffiti that’s both commissioned and spontaneous. It is here that Stein’s friend, Bligh Twyford-Moore, and fellow artist Noni Cragg, run the Gladdy Drawing Club every Tuesday. The man next to me is a scientist: this art club is the only burst of creativity he gets all week, he says. It also seems to be the perfect low-key gathering for types who don’t like being overly social. After he has finished posing, I ask Stein about the challenge of being scrutinised. He is busy constructing his own worlds, he says; and in any case, he’s used to not moving for long periods of time when he’s engaged in his own art practice. “I’ve had spiders actually make webs between my limbs because I’ve been stationary for so long,” he says. Increasingly, life-drawing classes are shaking off the tradition of fluoro-lit community halls and serious scribbling in favour of immersive evenings that rely on deep collaboration with the models. Most famously, there’s Dr Sketchy’s Anti-Art school, “alt-drawing” classes that use burlesque and cabaret performers as models. Founded by Molly Crabapple in a New York dive bar in 2005, Dr Sketchy’s is now a global phenomenon. Gladdy shares a similar focus on finding a variety of bodies: Stein’s fellow models include performance artist Betty Grumble, showgirl Porcelain Alice, and couple Katie-Louise and Timothy Nicol-Ford, who run demi-couture label Nicol & Ford “for all identities and bodies”. “It’s not about the typical male gaze,” says Twyford-Moore of the models. “And I also like to find people who appeal to the queer gaze.” Twyford-Moore, an illustrator and a roadie, thought a life-drawing club would be a “cool throwback idea”. He took inspiration from clubs he’d seen in Melbourne, both in terms of having themes (Gladdy Drawing Club has covered Wonder Woman, Hulk and Wolverine) and booking models who have reputations in their own right. “They’re exactly the vibe I’m after – queer-inclusive, models that look different to each other,” he says. “Even in life-drawing, Sydney is stuffy and conservative.” One Melbourne institution that inspired him is Miss Muse Life Drawing, held every Tuesday at the Grace Darling hotel in Collingwood. As the name suggests, there’s an emphasis on the model-as-muse. “I worked as a model myself for eight years,” says Miss Muse founder Michaela Meadow, who is also a photographer. “I wanted to open up a platform where the models can bring something creative to it. A lot of the sessions are themed, and much time is spent on playlists, sets and costumes.” These themes range from art movements, such as surrealist artists Leonor Fini and Claude Cahun, to cinema, such as Jean-Luc Godard, Pedro Almodóvar, Bonnie and Clyde and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. (The models’ poses and outfits reference the films.) Top Secret life drawing is another: usually held at Melbourne’s Abbotsford Convent (there was a naughty nun session recently), there are occasional pop-up events held elsewhere, such as at Easey’s in Collingwood – a rooftop restaurant made up of old train carriages – and at 24 Moons, a Northcote nightclub. Top Secret founder, Jean-Luc Syndikas, works at an architecture firm by day, but is also a film buff who wanted to create an art community. His club’s themes have included Blade Runner, Squid Game, Mata Hari and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. “I had a model dressed up as April O’Neil, in a yellow jumpsuit, who’s an iconic cosplay character,” Syndikas says. “The model was used to doing classical stuff, but she thought it was awesome.” For transgender day of visibility in March, he booked model Rora Mac, who stripped down from men’s clothing to a righteous 1980s aerobics look. “It was a really powerful night; she told us a story,” says Syndikas. All three drawing groups went online during lockdowns, which suddenly allowed them to hire models and recruit artists from around the world. All three have kept their online classes after reopening. As Meadow says, “Maybe someone doesn’t live in the city or they have young children or disabilities, or some other reason they can’t make it in person.” At the Gladdy, my two hours of drawing Stein have absolutely flown and I haven’t looked at my phone once … probably because I’m too busy peering at everyone else’s work to see if they’re struggling with doing the feet, too. After we’ve built up to 10-minute poses, set to meditative music to encourage flow state, the music switches to some aggressive hardcore for the final two-minute bursts. “It’s like when they clap you on the back at the end of a massage,” Twyford-Moore says, which explains why I am attacking the paper with sudden haste. “You’re being readjusted back to your normal state.” For a newbie like me, Twyford-Moore suggests I think of drawing as a verb, instead of a noun: “Like you’re literally coming to do drawing, not to walk away with five drawings that are perfect.” Personally, he likes to start with a barely visible, warm grey No 1 pencil, then get serious with a hard black pencil. Syndikas, on the other hand, recommends I break a figure down into basic shapes: circle, square, triangle. “You can use charcoal or whatever other medium to trace over that and create your figure from those building blocks.” As for Meadow? She encourages peeking. “Look around at what other people are doing,” she says. “It’s a great way of learning.” Gladdy Drawing Club is held every Tuesday at the Lord Gladstone hotel, Sydney, and online.

4/27/2022,"Rebecca Brown had only just made it home from hospital with her newborn baby after a complicated birth, when she was given an eviction notice from their long-term rental in Queensland’s Lockyer Valley. Brown, her partner Nickolas, three-year-old daughter Octavia, one-year-old Taitum and baby Nashton endured 38 rejections before finding a property 60km away, in Walloon. Now, they’re facing the prospect of being forced out of home for a second time. “It doesn’t matter where you go,” Brown says. “There’s no escaping this rental crisis. It’s just everywhere.” “It started in September. I remember it so vividly, because I was standing in the kitchen making my son’s first birthday cake. “My husband went to the driveway and there was a real estate agent parked there. He said – ‘did you know your house has been listed for sale?’ “We didn’t, nobody had said anything to us. From there, we had people come through and have a look at the place … [the agents] told us they were investors and we wouldn’t have to leave. “Come November, I went into hospital and had a little bubba. And 10 days after getting home from a complicated C-section and almost losing him, the real estate said to us: ‘the owners want to move in, they want the keys ASAP, can you guys start looking?’ “We were like ‘oh my god, are you serious?’. So we did start looking, and happened to find a house at Fernvale [in Somerset] for $420 a week – we were paying $400, so it wasn’t too much more – and we were told it’d be a long-term lease. “A few days before our move in January, we got a phone call saying the current tenants were refusing to move, even though they were evicted three months prior. They said ‘there’s nothing we can do, we’ve applied to QCAT [the administrative tribunal] but because of Covid there’s a huge wait’. “The QCAT date was set for 1 March, and we only had until 18 January to find a house before the new owners were going to have us removed. “We’d signed a contract, paid a bond and rent and we couldn’t move in. We’d already given our own vacate notice, so we went to the real estate, explained our situation, and were told we’d get an extra 24 hours. We were back to square one.” “Our budget was $400 to $450 a week even though we’re on Centrelink – that’s our rental history, that’s what we’ve got a proven ability to pay. “We’d go up higher … You have to keep a roof over your head, [but] the most I applied for was $460. “We weren’t picky with the location, we applied for everything from Toowoomba through Ipswich and right down the range through the Lockyer Valley. “[But] between the entire Stanthorpe [Southern Downs] and Warwick region, there were six properties to rent. Just one has four bedrooms. “We got to the point where we were going to apply to housing commission, but it’s a seven year wait. We tried to get into crisis and temporary housing, and there’s just nothing available – it’s gone. “My husband has been on disability for 12 years now, and I’ve had to become his full-time carer for 10 of those years. It’s not one of those situations where you just ‘go out and get a job’. You feel so helpless.” “We have always gotten the first house we have applied for, but not any more. We have 16 years of perfect rental history and it means absolutely nothing. “I had times where I put in an application and 12 hours later I get an email saying ‘sorry, it’s gone’. I was jumping on these houses as soon as they were advertised. “You’re on your own … I was giving cover letters and explanations of our situation, screenshots of our savings.

My husband went to look at one house in Ipswich and was sending me photos of another car, and another car, and another car, lined down the street around the corner, he was fighting to get through the door. “I went on social media reaching out to everyone, everywhere. Eventually 38 rejections later I had a lady message me who was property manager for a house we applied for in December. “She vouched for us, and the owner of a property in Ipswich said “sure, they can come into the house on a six-month lease as a trial’, to make sure we could pay rent. He was prepared to put us on a two-year lease.” “This house is much smaller. We came from a big four bedroom on acreage so we had to significantly downsize everything. But the only thing we required was a fence for safe outdoor space and air conditioning, because my husband’s medical condition is heat affected. “That was it – we didn’t require two bathrooms, just basic necessities. We wanted to sign a long lease here. “So you can imagine our surprise when eight weeks into the lease, we find out our house is up for sale. Apparently there’s been an offer from an investor. We don’t know which way it’s going to go. “My health is not in a good place and I’m going to need surgery soon. Our daughter is devastated, her anxiety is through the roof. “She says ‘I want to go back to the old house, I want my old room’. She had a big bedroom, she’s got a little one here. Of course, the real estate agent has put a huge ‘for sale’ sign in our front yard, and she goes: ‘Mum, what’s that?’. She remembers. “She can’t sleep at the moment, she’s worried about losing her bedroom. She’s asked for a new princess bed if we have to [move], and we say ‘yes, OK’. She’s scared the real estate will take all her stuff … she’s freaking out. “We can’t believe what is happening. It’s been a really awful few months. “We sit here and wait, and hope an investor buys it and we can get another lease. But if they decide not to lease it out, we’re going to be left empty handed.

4/27/2022,"You’ve no doubt seen plenty of movie villains before – nasty pasties determined to destroy the world, or defeat the hero, or ask employees to work on the weekend. But you’ve never seen a hellraiser quite like Bette Davis in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, a film that stormed in cinemas 60 years ago and, by God, still packs a punch. The greatest feature of Davis’ wall-rattling performance is that it’s so strong, so toxically and overpoweringly good, it seems to swell and morph the very fabric of the production around her, lifting the whole film into a heightened state of melodrama. Director Robert Aldrich’s 1962 classic, which was based on a novel by Henry Farrell published two years earlier, begins in 1917, with the name of Davis’ titular character – Baby Jane Hudson – emblazoned on a theatre marquee. Inside, Baby Jane (a child prodigy) sings and dances in front of an adoring audience. As they watch on from the wings, her mother tells Baby Jane’s older sister Blanche that “some day it’s going to be you that’s getting all the attention. And when that happens, I want you to try to be kinder to Jane and your father than they are to you now.” The story jumps ahead to 1935 and mother’s prophecy has come to pass. Baby Jane’s performance style has fallen out of vogue and Blanche (Joan Crawford) is now “the biggest thing in movies today”, as one bigwig on the studio lot puts it. But that too changes (all this transpires very early in the running time) when Blanche is paralysed in a car accident. It is unclear exactly what happened, triggering a question that hangs over the entire film – did Jane hurt her sister on purpose? – which is only directly answered at the very end. Another jump forward moves the drama into a large shadowy house, where the two sisters, now middle-aged, live. Davis as Jane is Norma Desmond stretched into grotesquery: unable to accept her lack of fame, she is a bitter and twisted alcoholic and the carer from hell for the kind and vulnerable Blanche. When Baby Jane performs one of her old songs in front of a mirror, singing “I’ve written a letter to daddy”, her voice lilted in a screech of desperation, it’s sad and pathetic. But you can’t feel sorry for her – she’s far too wicked to solicit empathy. Baby Jane learns that Blanche intends to sell their home and is worried that her sister will have her committed. What follows blends family (melo)drama, a Misery-esque domestic thriller and suburban horror. Jane’s cruelty scales up to an excruciating fever pitch while Blanche desperately attempts to solicit help from the outside world. For a while, their housekeeper Elvira (Maidie Norman) appears to be Blanche’s only hope – but this is not a film with any heroes. It sure as hell has a villain, though: Baby Jane made the American Film Institute’s list of the 100 greatest baddies, at No. 44. This is a little low for my liking, but assessing this conga line of nasty pasties is (to mix food-related metaphors) a matter of apples and oranges. How do you compare Davis’ performance, for instance, to a more fantastic portrayal of evil such as Margaret Hamilton’s cackling Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz? The latter has irresistible cartoon menace, but Baby Jane is in the home, the kitchen, the bedroom. She emotionally abuses her sister while also swinging a literal hammer and galavanting around like a monster from a William Castle movie. Who could forget the moment when poor Blanche takes the tray off her dinner, only to discover Baby Jane has placed a dead canary on top of it? What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? arrived roughly halfway through Davis’ prolific career and is one of her best-known roles. There was always a darkness in her beauty, a mix of sass and sinister that simmered and sometimes very memorably spilled over; like in her 1940 film The Letter, when she shrieks, “I still love the man I killed!”, or the 1950 classic All About Eve, when her titular character – another boozy schemer – warns party guests to “fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy night.” In Aldrich’s film nothing is subtle, and nothing about Davis simmers. She cranks the dial to eleven, then snaps off the handle and feeds it to you for dinner – on a bed of your worst fears.",Arts/Film,What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?: still brilliantly shocking at 60,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/27/what-ever-happened-to-baby-jane-still-brilliantly-shocking-at-60

His treatment of Rishi Sunak, however, is inexcusably generous and looks alarmingly like support for his candidacy should Johnson do the decent thing and resign. Jenkins describes Sunak as an inexperienced but competent chancellor who has made mistakes and faces the toughest challenge in a generation. This ignores or at best glosses over the seriousness of those mistakes: the green card, his failure to recognise or understand the desperate plight of so many, his failure to grasp the significance of his wife’s tax affairs, the disastrous spring statement etc. Worse still, Jenkins goes on to assert, without any supporting argument or evidence, that Sunak “did not deserve to be paraded as Johnson’s accomplice in the last fixed-penalty ritual”. It is difficult to see what distinguishes Sunak from Johnson here; the two men in the two greatest offices of state are guilty of the same offence.
