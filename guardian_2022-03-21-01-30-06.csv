3/21/2022,"A peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is “close”, Turkey’s foreign minister has claimed, as the UN reported that at least 902 civilians have been killed in the four weeks of the war. Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, whose government has been acting as a “mediator and facilitator”, said there was “momentum” behind the negotiations despite the scepticism of western governments. Kyiv was said to be willing to change its constitution to abandon aspirations to join Nato but wants Turkey, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN security council to act as guarantors of any deal. Çavuşoğlu, who visited Russia and Ukraine this week to meet his counterparts, said: “Of course, it is not an easy thing to come to terms with while the war is going on, while civilians are killed, but we would like to say that momentum is still gained … We see that the parties are close to an agreement.” The UN’s human rights office said on Sunday that at least 902 civilians had been killed and 1,459 injured as of midnight on 19 March, with the real toll likely to be much higher. Most of the casualties were from explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes, the OHCHR said. It has not been able to receive or verify casualty reports from several badly hit cities including Mariupol. Ukraine’s government claims that among the dead are 112 children. While western officials believe the negotiators on either side are serious about the ongoing negotiations there is doubt about whether Vladimir Putin is sincere about wanting peace. Speaking on Sunday, the British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said it was “encouraging” that the talks were continuing but that the west needed to have a “degree of scepticism”. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that despite the doubts he would continue to try to find a compromise with the Kremlin. He told CNN: “I’m ready for negotiations. I was ready for the last two years. And without negotiations we cannot end this war. “All the people who think that this dialogue is shallow, and that it is not going to resolve anything, they just don’t understand that this is very valuable. If there is just 1% chance for us to stop this war we need to take this chance, we need to do that. “I can’t tell you about the result of these negotiations [but] we’re losing people on a daily basis, innocent people on the ground. Russian forces have come to exterminate us, to kill us. And we have demonstrated the dignity of our people and our army, we are able to deal a powerful blow, we are able to strike back. “But unfortunately, our dignity is not going to preserve their lives. We have to use any format, any chance, in order to have the possibility of negotiating the possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war.” An official in Zelenskiy’s office told the Associated Press that the main subject discussed between the two sides last week was whether Russian troops would remain in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, told Sky News that redrawing Ukraine‘s borders is “absolutely not” being considered by Kyiv in a sign of the major obstacles in the way of a deal. She said: “Ukrainian territory is a territory which has been fixed [since] 1991. That is not an option for discussion.” In an interview with daily HurriyetHürriyet, İbrahim Kalin, a spokesman for Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said six points were the focus of the talks. They are Ukraine‘s neutrality, disarmament and security guarantees, the so-called “de-Nazification” of the country, removal of obstacles on the use of the Russian language in Ukraine, the status of the breakaway Donbas region and Crimea which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Turkey said it was ready to host a meeting between Zelenskiy and Putin which has been called for by Ukraine’s president. “We are working day and night for peace,” Çavuşoğlu said.",News/World news,"Ukraine-Russia peace deal ‘close’, says Turkey despite western scepticism",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/ukraine-russia-peace-deal-close-says-turkey-despite-western-scepticism
3/21/2022,"One of the UK’s biggest manufacturers of asbestos, and industry bodies it cofounded, historically withheld information on risks posed by the carcinogenic material, playing down the dangers while lobbying the government for product warnings to be tempered, according to documents released after a lengthy court battle. A lawyer who acted for the Asbestos Victims Support Groups Forum UK in its fight to obtain the documents about Cape compared its behaviour to the tobacco industry’s former refusal to admit evidence of harms from smoking while its own research showed the opposite. Despite all types of asbestos being banned in the UK since 1999, it still kills thousands of people every year. According to the court documents, a partner company of Cape’s was considering a warning label on asbestos products in 1958 but Cape advised it that “a caution label on our products and none on [our competitors] would make our selling efforts most difficult”. They also state that in 1969, Cape’s group medical adviser accepted in a document that the fatal cancer mesothelioma could be caused by “short and possibly small” exposure and that “no type of asbestos proved innocent”. In the same year, a research review by the Asbestos Research Council (ARC), of which Cape was a founding member, accepted the link between asbestos – now banned – and mesothelioma, stating: “Elimination of the dust hazard is therefore the only answer.” Nevertheless, when Cape began to label its product in 1976 with a “take care with Asbestos” warning, it said “breathing asbestos dust can damage health” but made no reference to the risk of mesothelioma, the documents show. Additionally, from 1966 the ARC successfully lobbied the government for regulation of asbestos products to be on a “maximum allowable concentration” basis rather than the “no dust policy” which had been proposed. The forum says the documents also show Cape’s in-house sampling data threw up significantly higher dust counts than industry standards for accepted levels of exposure but data unfavourable to Cape was withheld. At the same time the company provided reassurance about asbestos. A 1976 booklet by the Asbestos Information Committee, of which Cape was also a founding member, said: “The normal use of asbestos products should not be a cause for anxiety.” In light of the information in the documents, the forum is demanding that Cape apologise and make a £10m donation towards mesothelioma research. The forum’s chair, Joanne Gordon, said: “We believe victims and their families deserve this by way of an apology from Cape for their deliberate deception and shamelessly causing deaths, adding insult by vehemently defending cases.” The documents originate from litigation brought against Cape on behalf of insurers by who had settled employers’ liability claims resulting from workers’ exposure to asbestos and who wanted to recoup some of their outlay. The case was settled before judgment but Graham Dring, then chair of the forum, successfully fought a three-year battle for the forum to access the court documents. Cape resisted disclosure, taking the case to the supreme court, but Dring succeeded in setting a legal precedent allowing written material placed before a court to be seen by a non-party. Harminder Bains, partner at Leigh Day, and whose father died of mesothelioma, acted for the forum pro bono for three years. She said she felt “revulsion and anger” when going through the documents. “They clearly show that Cape knew of the high risk of fatal disease, yet deliberately withheld information and lobbied the government to protect their profits,” she said. “As a result of their greed many men and women including my father have lost their lives. “This cover up would not have come to the light had it not been for the forum’s persistence.” A spokesperson for Cape said: “Cape was taken over in 2017 and its current management cannot comment on this matter, based on historical events that occurred over 40 years ago. However, Cape remains fully committed to the scheme of arrangement that was put in place and approved by a UK court to provide compensation payouts and will continue to meet all its obligations associated with that scheme.”",News/UK news,"UK asbestos maker withheld information on material’s risks, court papers show",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/20/uk-asbestos-maker-withheld-information-on-material-risks-court-papers-show
3/21/2022,"The Russian TV editor who interrupted a news broadcast to protest the Ukraine war said on Sunday she acted out of dissatisfaction at propaganda disseminated by Vladimir Putin’s government, and said she had turned down an offer of asylum in France despite fearing further retaliation. Marina Ovsyannikova, who describes herself as “a patriot”, was fined 30,000 roubles ($280) by a court in Moscow last week for the “spontaneous” act of rebellion in which she appeared during the live newscast with a sign saying “No War”. On Sunday, she told ABC’s This Week she needed to speak out after watching her employer, Channel One, spread “lies” about the Ukraine war. “After a week of coverage of this situation, the atmosphere on the channel was so unpleasant that I realised that I could not go back there,” she said. “I could see what in reality was happening in Ukraine. And what we showed on our programmes was very different from what was going on in reality.” She said the knowledge the channel was imparting false information ate away at her. “I could not believe that such a thing could happen, that this gruesome war could take place. And as soon as the war began, I could not eat. I could not sleep,” she said, adding that she had considered joining public protests in Moscow. “I could see security dragging people away … and I decided that this was going to be a rather useless action on my part. Maybe I could do something more meaningful, with more impact, where I could show to the rest of the world that Russians are against the war. “And I could show to the Russian people that this is just propaganda, expose this propaganda for what it is and maybe stimulate some people to speak up against the war.” Ovsyannikova, who could face further action after the Kremlin suggested she breached rules on “hooliganism”, said the French president Emmanuel Macron offered her asylum but she turned it down. “I am very worried for the safety of my children, first and foremost. And I’m very grateful to Mr Macron for his offer, but I have publicly refused to take political asylum in France because I am a patriot,” she said. “I want to live in Russia. My children want to live in Russia. We had a very comfortable life in Russia. And I don’t want to immigrate and lose another 10 years of my life to assimilate in some other country. “And now I believe in the history of my country. The times are very dark and very difficult, and every person who has a civil position who wants to make that civil position known must speak up.”",News/World news,"Marina Ovsyannikova, Russian TV protester, decries Putin propaganda",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/marina-ovsyannikova-russian-journalist-refuses-france-asylum
3/21/2022,"Crisis? What crisis? Into the top half of the Premier League and the quarter-finals of European competition, important players coming back from injury to enable rotation, Leicester City saw off Brentford with some comfort and a couple of memorable early goals from Timothy Castagne and James Maddison. They even came up with a ploy to counter their opponents’ set-piece threat, so no wonder Brendan Rodgers, notwithstanding Yoane Wissa’s late goal, was smiling in the spring sunshine at the final whistle. Brentford rallied in the second half, as Leicester tired in their 42nd match of the season, following Thursday’s Europa Conference League trip to Rennes, and started to believe they could cope without Christian Eriksen, sidelined with Covid, when Wissa cut back to score from the edge of the penalty area five minutes from time. But Leicester, now defeated only once in 12 home games, deserved to hold out and, after successive wins over Norwich and Burnley, Brentford, eight points clear of the relegation zone, still have some work to do to be certain of retaining their status. Leicester’s goals came from almost exactly the same spot but from vastly contrasting sources. Castagne produced such a brilliant right-footed shot from just outside the left corner of the penalty area, after receiving Harvey Barnes’s short pass, for only his third goal since joining from Atlanta in September 2020, that he ran away with his hands to his head, as if in disbelief. On his first start of the year, after a thigh injury, this was some way to mark his return. That shot swerved powerfully into the far top corner, in the 20th minute, and 13 minutes later, David Raya, the Brentford goalkeeper, was picking the ball out of the other corner. Maddison picked himself up, having been fouled by Mathias Jensen, and bent his shot into the near top corner, for his 13th goal of the season in all competitions. In advance, set pieces had looked likely to be an intriguing and potentially decisive factor in this match. No team has had more problems in defending them than Leicester, who have conceded a divisional-high 20 goals from restarts, while Brentford had scored 50% of their 32 Premier League goals from this source. So when the visiting team had their first corner midway through the first half, it was instructive to see that Rodgers had come up with a plan. Three Leicester forwards promptly ran off to the halfway line, leaving Thomas Frank with a dilemma: to stick, with two defenders back, or twist, and bring sufficient cover back. The Brentford manager went with the latter, albeit with only three defenders, rather than with one man spare. The corner came to nothing anyway, and Leicester could breathe again. Leicester repeated the trick in the second half, when Brentford were starting to work a way back into the game. Christian Nørgaard, Vitaly Janet and Rico Henry came back to mark Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho and Barnes. From Jensen’s corner into a thinned-out crowd, Ethan Pinnock just got the better of Caglar Soyuncu but headed wide. By this stage the game had drifted, pleasingly, with the ambience of an end-of-season affair. The sun was out, the team took it in turns to attack and the match became strung out. Iheanacho ran clear on to James Justin’s lofted pass, got away from the last man but then dinked his shot over Kasper Schmeichel and against the outside of the post. At the other end, Brentford started to sense a way back into the game, and Schmeichel had to make two brilliant saves: first from Pontus Jansson’s header, following Kristoffer Ajer’s right-wing centre; then from Bryan Mbeumo’s effort after Ivan Toney’s centre from the same area. Rodgers reacted, switching Justin to left-back, where Castagne was feeling the pace, and reintroducing Jonny Evans alongside Soyuncu, with Daniel Amartey pushing out to right-back. What a luxury it must feel for Rodgers, to have such options returning.",Sport/Football,Castagne and Maddison on target to give Leicester win over Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/20/leicester-brentford-premier-league-match-report
3/21/2022,"James HamiltonWeidenfeld & Nicolson, £25, pp472 This well researched and illuminating biography of the artist John Constable reclaims him from the chocolate-box conservatism to which he has been consigned. James Hamilton’s Constable is, admittedly, no trailblazing radical, but nor is he the grumpy reactionary that he has sometimes seemed when placed alongside Gainsborough and Turner. Instead, Hamilton manages to reshape Constable’s quintessential Englishness (he never left the country) not as the failing of provincialism that others have called it, but as the force behind his art. Not for nothing is Dedham Vale known as Constable country. Samuel FisherCorsair, £12.99, pp151 In the small Essex village of Wivenhoe, a man is found murdered.

Samuel Fisher’s second novel builds on his promising debut, The Chameleon, with an elegantly terrifying narrative that is reminiscent of Graham Swift’s Waterland in its focus on an insular, secretive community in the east of England, but stays entirely contemporary in its environmental concerns.

3/21/2022,"Ministers have serious questions to answer on the growing scandal at P&O Ferries and must make it a catalyst to improve workers’ rights, the Trades Union Congress said on Sunday. The TUC accused the government of sitting on its hands and failing to protect workers after P&O sacked 800 staff on Thursday with a plan to replace them with cheaper agency workers. It has emerged that ministers were informed in advance about the mass redundancies. The TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, demanded the government “urgently bring forward an employment bill to stop workers from being treated like disposable labour – and make sure what happened at P&O never happens again”. She accused ministers of failing to challenge P&O on what she called “unconscionable tactics – or even question whether these actions were legal”. O’Grady called on the company to immediately reinstate all sacked staff, without any loss of pay. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, criticised the treatment of workers by the ferry company. “What we are seeing is appalling, the way that they have treated their workers, it is awful, it is wrong,” Sunak told the BBC.He added that ministers were examining the company’s actions and whether they complied with regulations on dismissing workers. Employment lawyers reacted with surprise to the company’s move to sack 800 seafarers out of the blue, and said that P&O Ferries may have broken several laws, potentially leaving it open to claims of unfair dismissal. Over the weekend, angry protests were held at ports across the UK. Trade union leaders and politicians joined sacked P&O Ferries workers in Dover, Hull, Liverpool and Larne amid growing rage over the company’s decision, with more protests planned for the coming days, including outside Parliament on Monday. On Sunday, P&O warned customers that its services would be “unable to run for the next few days”. The company said it was “advising travellers of alternative arrangements” for its cross-Channel and Irish Sea routes. P&O Ferries has been accused of looking to exploit a loophole in minimum wage laws, in order to bring in cheap workers to crew its vessels. The firm has previously been accused of hiring workers for as little as £1.83 an hour. Union officials have said P&O may be able to cut its wage bill by up to half by using agency workers instead of existing staff. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said it had discovered that new crew on ships on the Liverpool-Dublin route will be paid at rates well below the minimum wage. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said there was no effective way to stop the company from paying workers less than the minimum wage and called for new employment legislation to protect seafarers. “We fear poverty pay will be accompanied by seafarers being chained to 12-hour day, seven-day week contracts that operate continuously for six months, with no pension,” he said. The RMT has called for a boycott of P&O services. Concerns have also been growing over a £146m deficit in the seafarers’ industry pension scheme, which is owed by P&O Ferries and its parent company DP World. It is thought the taxpayer could be liable for the shortfall in the Merchant Navy Ratings pension fund, which includes retired P&O crew, if it was left unpaid. DP World, one of the world’s largest port operators, is owned by Dubai’s sovereign wealth fund. It bought P&O Ferries for the second time in 2019, for $322m (£244m), having sold it earlier in the decade. Losses at the business are thought to have escalated in recent months, after disruption to travel during the Covid-19 pandemic, combined with increased post-Brexit paperwork for cross-Channel services, and the rising cost of diesel. DP World also owns the London Gateway port, which was opened as the first of the controversial freeports championed by Sunak, and established by the government last year. Sunak said on Sunday the government was examining all of its commercial relationships with P&O Ferries. A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said it had taken the decision to make 800 staff redundant “as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options”, after it made a £100m loss. “Ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn’t survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies,” they said.",News/Business,"P&O Ferries scandal must be turning point for workers’ rights, says TUC ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/p-and-o-ferries-scandal-must-be-turning-point-for-workers-rights-says-tuc
3/21/2022,"The US is likely to see an increase in Covid cases like that in Europe and the UK thanks to the BA.2 virus subvariant but not a dangerous surge, Anthony Fauci said on Sunday. Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser also said the US was “clearly going in the right direction” on the coronavirus pandemic. BA.2, Fauci told ABC’s This Week, “has a degree of transmission advantage over the original Omicron [variant], but not multifold advantage. So, it’s about 50% to 60% or so more transmissible, which means ultimately it might take over as a dominant variant. “Clearly, throughout the world it’s about 80-plus percent, 85% of the isolate. In the United States, it’s still somewhere around 30%. “So it does have an increased transmission capability. However, when you look at the cases, they do not appear to be any more severe and they do not appear to evade immune responses either from vaccines or prior infection. “So the bottom line is we likely will see an uptick in cases as we’ve seen in the European countries, particularly the UK, where … they have BA.2. They have a relaxation of some restrictions such as indoor masking and there’s a waning of immunity. “Hopefully, we won’t see a surge. I don’t think we will. The easiest way to prevent that is to continue to get people vaccinated. And for those who have been vaccinated, to continue to get them boosted.” Fauci said he did not see any reason to reimpose public health restrictions relaxed under a federal approach meant to focus on areas with pressure on hospital systems. “But you always have to have the flexibility,” he said. “Remember, when the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] came out with the modification of their metrics, which would lead to the guidelines of what regions or counties in the country should have a masking indoors, they made it very clear that … if we do see a significant surge, particularly one that might result in increased hospitalisations, we have to be prepared to pivot and perhaps reinstitute some of those restrictions. “But right now, at this point, I don’t see that.” More than 970,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US. Fauci said vaccination and booster rates still needed to be improved and said Congress should build-up supplies of anti-virals, tests and booster shots. “We just can’t stand still,” he said, “particularly as we appear to be in somewhat of a lull … where cases continue to come down, deaths continue to come down and hospitalisations [too]. “That’s no time at all to declare victory because this virus has fooled us before, and we really must be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant and we don’t want to be caught flatfooted on that.” Fauci, 81 and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, has served seven presidents since 1984. He has said he will consider retiring when the pandemic is done. Asked if he was any nearer such a decision, he told ABC: “I’m not so sure. I want to make sure we’re really out of this before I really seriously consider doing anything different. “We’re still in this. We have a way to go. I think we’re clearly going in the right direction. Hope we stay that way.”",News/US news,"US likely to see Covid cases rise from Omicron subvariant, Fauci says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/20/us-covid-cases-new-variant-fauci
3/21/2022,"Russia has said it has twice deployed its newest Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missile in Ukraine, claiming on Sunday to have destroyed a fuel depot near Mykolaiv and on Saturday an underground missile and ammunition storage site in the west. The state news agency RIA Novosti has said the attacks represented the first use of the next-generation weapon since the start of the war in Ukraine and western analysts said they were the first time hypersonic missiles had been used in combat. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has described the Kinzhal, designed to be launched from a MiG fighter jet, as “an ideal weapon”. It can fly at up to 10 times the speed of sound and – like a slower cruise missile – can manoeuvre in mid-flight, making it harder for air-defence systems to track and intercept. The missiles can be used to deliver conventional warheads at higher speeds and more accurately than others, but could also be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Several countries are working on the technology, including China and the US. Vasily Kashin, a Russian analyst, told Agence France-Presse the greater penetration and destructive power of the Kinzhal system would be more efficient than subsonic missiles at destroying underground storage sites, but other experts have suggested it would not have a major impact on the course of the conflict. Pavel Felgenhauer, another Russian analyst, said the missile would change little on the ground in Ukraine beyond “giving a certain psychological and propaganda effect”, adding that its use may suggest Russian forces were running out of other weapons. A Belgian defence strategy analyst, Joseph Henrotin, also tweeted that Russia might be running out of Iskander short-range ballistic missiles, or wanted to raise the stakes by deploying a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile. Ukraine’s government has confirmed the attacks but said it was not yet able to say what type of missiles were used.",News/World news,What are hypersonic missiles and why is Russia using them?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/what-are-hypersonic-missiles-and-why-is-russia-using-them-kinzhal-ukraine
