2/10/2022,"Plans to end remaining Covid restrictions in England by 21 February have been announced by the prime minister, coming a month earlier than initially proposed. In an opening statement made during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, he said: “Provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we will be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive, a full month early.”  Guardian readers share their reactions to the proposal. The relaxation of Covid restrictions in their entirety is laughably shortsighted. Of course, a transition to “living with Covid” is a must for every nation, but whereas others are emphasising caution and reasonable measures – such as face masks, contact tracing and isolation – this government is throwing away all measures, and for what? To save Boris, and Boris alone. Covid is not simply a respiratory disease. But Boris is done with pretending to care about vulnerable people, elderly people, or anybody besides himself. And when the next variant arrives, how soon will Mr Johnson show his true, science-doubting self? I do not trust Boris … or his Bollinger-laden fridge. Lena R, 28, Silversmith, West Midlands This [plan] makes everyone less safe – individuals can no longer make decisions on their own safety as that depends on others doing the right thing and isolating when sick, not to mention wearing a mask in public spaces and taking regular LFTs. This is no way to live: extremely high levels of disease, and long Covid a real possibility. I am continually amazed by how the government talk as though the pandemic is over. It is not. I desperately want it to all be over too but pretending it doesn’t exist seems very childish to me, and actually very dangerous as current things stand. Ultimately though, this should be taken for what it is – not a public health decision but a political decision designed to save Johnson’s job. Jude Geddes, 40, full time carer of parent, Shoreham by Sea I had Covid over Christmas and it led to severe bronchitis and now long Covid. Extreme fatigue, muscle pain and chest pains. I am not even able to do the most basic of tasks. It has been horrible and is affecting hundreds of thousands of people. We do need to look to the future but rushing now just seems ridiculous and the only reason for doing it is to save Johnson’s skin and gain him some popularity no matter what the science says. It is awful and I am extremely worried for the future. Stuart, 40, Merseyside I would like to know how this will affect the care and nursing home sector. My mother, who is in her late 80s and in frail health, has essentially been trapped in her nursing home for two years. The home has done its best to allow outdoor visits but this is obviously very difficult in practical terms given my mother’s poor health and the weather. Recently it has been a nightmare due to the highly infectuous nature of Omicron: every week one or more staff members catch it so the home closes again to visitors. My mother is too frail now to come down to the outdoor terrace. Her mental health is declining as she is so lonely without mine and my sister’s visits. I consider that people in my family’s situation are practically invisible. I would like to know how the specific regulations on care homes will be changed to firstly continue to protect residents but also make visiting easier. Anonymous [The decision is] fully justified by falling case numbers and death rates. We also need to encourage people to regain their lives, with recommendations that masks are no longer needed in all situations or we will be stuck with them forever. John, 71, retired, London A good idea that has come at a bad time. With everything going on at No 10, you can only see this move by Johnson as one thing: another “dead cat” distraction to turn the eyes of the masses off him. In essence, I agree with the move, as Covid seems to be dying down now and the vaccination programme has been a relative success, but it says a lot about our country and government when a move like this can only be viewed through the eyes of a cynic. Jacques, 26, recruitment consultant, London I have chronic myeloid leukaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, an autoimmune disease. My consultant does not consider me to be at a hugely greater risk than the general population as my conditions are currently under control. However, there are millions of people who are at huge risk of becoming seriously ill and even dying should they catch Covid: people who have more severe types of leukaemia or those who have had bone marrow transplants, for example. Are these lives expendable? Do these people have to stay in a near isolated state to keep themselves safe? I understand the other health and financial implications of getting back to “normal” but why this could not be tempered by mask wearing and isolating if infected I cannot understand. It may even encourage people who have severe cold- or flu-like illnesses to be out and about. That will give rise to further infections that may require hospitalisation. There are no easy answers but I feel that the needs of too many have not really been taken into consideration. Karen Smith, 64, retired, north Devon Removing the legal need to self-isolate after a positive test will lead to many service workers, through no fault of their own, being coerced into going to work even if they’re infectious. I fear for the knock-on effects this will have and will be avoiding indoor dining etc. My biggest concern is the effect of long Covid. While I may not be vulnerable, I fear these long-term effects. Losing clear thinking would mean losing the future career that I have worked hard for, and losing a sense of smell/taste would mean losing one of my biggest joys in life. I will continue wearing a mask in public settings, and will be eating out a lot less. This terrible proposal erodes my trust in government and my perception of safety.

2/10/2022,"When you think of Steven Van Zandt’s acting work, your mind will automatically flick to The Sopranos. A vast, swaggering monument of a show, The Sopranos quite rightly holds the reputation of playing a pivotal role in the history of television. But let us also not forget that – 10 years ago this week – Van Zandt followed The Sopranos with another show. And it was a show which was every bit as important a milestone in TV’s evolution. That’s right, let us all wish a happy anniversary to Lilyhammer. You remember Lilyhammer. It was a Norwegian show about the messy misadventures of a mafia underboss living in the witness protection programme 100 miles north of Oslo. It ran for three seasons and Bruce Springsteen had a cameo in the final episode. If we are being completely honest, it wasn’t particularly good. But, when it debuted in 2012, it was the very first Netflix original series. And what better way to mark its 10th anniversary than rewatching it to see how Netflix has changed over the years? There isn’t any. So we did it. Here are our learnings.  This was back when there was a groundswell of prestige TV floating around, when Mad Men and Breaking Bad were redefining television on a weekly basis. Lilyhammer, however, was stilted and saggy. Tonally it couldn’t seem to decide if it was a quirky character piece or an out and out crime drama. And, although his spectrum of grunts and shrugs was well deployed in The Sopranos, having to operate as the emotional fulcrum of an entire show was proof enough that Van Zandt was really no actor. In 2011, Netflix realised that the best way to drive new subscribers was to offer original content. In March it hired David Fincher to help adapt the BBC series House of Cards for the service. And then, while it waited for that show to reach fruition, it co-produced Lilyhammer with the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK1. Lilyhammer beat House of Cards to screens by almost exactly a year. And so, when it comes to writing the history of how streaming services began to turn the tables on traditional broadcasters, an underwhelming drama about a mobster in snow will go down as the key series. The streaming service’s biggest achievement this decade has been in how it analyses user data. It knows the type of shows you watch, the times you watch them, when you are most likely to check out, and a million other things. As such, it can confidently commission a new show and finesse it according to data to ensure that it will have a baked-in audience. You have to assume this technology was much more rudimentary a decade ago, because no algorithm in the world would suggest that the best show with which to launch a television revolution is a show about Silvio Dante in Norway. When House of Cards won its first Emmy in 2013, it completely upended the traditional broadcaster applecart. Until then, Netflix wasn’t even seen as television – at that point, people were still referring to House of Cards as a series of webisodes – and this is something it has maximised on ever since. At last year’s Emmys, Netflix blew the rest of the competition away, winning 44 trophies. Its nearest rival, HBO, won less than half that amount. With the best will in the world, the only way that Netflix could have won an award when it only had Lilyhammer would be if the Emmys initiated a new category entitled Most Unsatisfyingly Gimmicky Premise. With success comes competition. This has been a decade of such extraordinary growth for Netflix that others were sure to join the fun. A decade ago, paying a monthly subscription for access to a streaming library seemed like a weird novelty. Now, every major television network has one, and each of them has something to offer. Disney+ has blockbuster franchises such as Marvel and Star Wars to tempt subscribers away. Apple TV+ is proving to be adept at comedy, with shows such as Ted Lasso and The Afterparty. HBO Max is dragging old favourites such as Friends and Sex and the City back out into the open air. Back when it was just a plucky underdog, showing people what Van Zandt would look like in the snow, Netflix had the run of the place. A decade on, and its ascendancy can no longer be guaranteed.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘If we are honest, it wasn’t particularly good’: looking back on the first Netflix original, 10 years later",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/09/lilyhammer-the-first-netflix-original-10-years-later
2/10/2022,"A grand, recent tradition of the Winter Olympics has bitten the dust after Norway’s men’s curling team took to the ice on Wednesday for their opening match in Beijing wearing plain dark blue trousers. In recent Games the elaborate designs on their trousers – often referred to as pants in American English usage – had become a highlight of the curling competition. The 2022 Norwegian men’s curling team had even teased supporters with a social media post in January saying: “We’re counting down the days, and so is our wardrobe it seems,” with a video of them in training wearing rather nondescript uniforms.  Some had interpreted that as a cryptic clue that there would be a dramatic reveal of the team’s trousers when they opened their campaign with a round-robin match against Switzerland in Beijing. But it was not to be. Over the years, the outlandish trousers have proved such a hit with fans that there is even a Facebook page dedicated to the Norwegian Olympic Curling Team’s Pants, with nearly half a million likes. The team’s penchant for standing out on the ice began when Thomas Ulsrud first skippered them at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. He went on to lead them again at Sochi in 2014 and at Pyeongchang in 2018. At each Olympics Norway’s curlers would arrive with a different set of trousers for each match, showcasing myriad eye-bursting designs. The team’s retirement in 2019 was marked on social media by the World Curling Federation, with them suggesting there were only two words to describe their contribution to the sport – “the pants”. Two words: The Pants. 🇳🇴👖Congratulations and all the best to Norway's legendary @TeamUlsrud as they officially put away their world-renowned curling pants after twelve years together. Thank you for the memories!#Curling will miss you. pic.twitter.com/NDK61Yk50h After they retired, Ulsrud recalled on social media that before the Vancouver Olympics “we spent the whole pre-camp discussing if [the trousers] was a good move, or if we would end up as clowns,” concluding that they “ended up with both maybe”. Although the Ulsrud team claimed a world gold in 2014, and two European titles in 2010 and 2011, the trousers have not proved to be a particularly lucky Olympic omen. Norway achieved the silver medal when they first wore them in 2010, but have not appeared on the podium since. This year’s team of Steffen Walstad, Torger Nergaard, Markus Hoeiberg, Magnus Vaagberg and Magnus Nedregotten will hope to improve that record. They opened their campaign on Wednesday with a 7-4 victory over Switzerland. Hoeiberg is a veteran of the trousers-era, having competed in 2014 and 2018, and was part of the squad that played their match against Japan, scheduled to be on Valentine’s Day in Pyeongchang in 2018, in red-and-pink love heart-themed trousers. As well as the trousers, the new Norway team have a lot to live up to. The Ulsrud team were nothing if not entertainers. During the world men’s finals in Nova Scotia in 2015, facing an impossible situation in the final end on the way to defeat by Sweden, Ulsrud opted to roll his final stone on its side, drawing laughter from the crowd, his teammates and opponents. The men’s curling competition at the 2022 Winter Olympics lasts from 9 February until the gold-medal match on Saturday 19 February, one of the last sporting actions of the Games. And one that sadly won’t feature colourful trousers, no matter how far Norway progress.",Sport/Sport,Norway’s plain trousers disappoint curling fans at Beijing Winter Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/09/norways-plain-trousers-disappoint-curling-fans-at-beijing-winter-olympics
2/10/2022,"Mikel Arteta says he was “the solution, not the problem” in the breakdown of relations that led to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s departure for Barcelona last week. Aubameyang signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with the La Liga club after leaving Arsenal by mutual consent. It concluded a dramatic unravelling in what had been a successful spell in north London, with Arteta dropping him from the squad and stripping him of the captaincy in mid-December after a series of disciplinary breaches.  When he was unveiled at the Camp Nou, Aubameyang said his problems at Arsenal had been “only with” Arteta. But Arteta struck back on Wednesday, putting the onus on his former centre-forward’s behaviour. “I am extremely grateful for what Auba has done at the club, for his contribution since I’ve been here,” he said when asked whether parting ways had been for the best. “The way I see myself in that relationship is the solution, not the problem. “What I’m saying is that I’ve been the solution, 100%. I can look in the eye of anybody.” On the subject of Aubameyang’s comments, he continued: “That’s his opinion and you have to respect that.” Arsenal visit Wolves, two places below them in eighth, on Thursday for their first match in 18 days. They spent part of that time on a training camp in Dubai and Arteta said his players were “ready to go”.",Sport/Football,Arteta insists he was ‘solution not problem’ with Aubameyang at Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/09/arteta-solution-not-problem-aubameyang-arsenal
2/10/2022,"For fans of the terpsichorean arts, this documentary about the creation, rehearsal and debut of the 2019 work Mám, by Irish dance and theatre troupe Teac Damsa, will be a treat. That’s especially true given the pandemic disrupted Mám’s scheduled tour, so this may be one of the few chances for people to see some of it, although crucially not the whole thing. Instead, slow-cinema maestro Pat Collins (last seen with ethnology documentary Henry Glassie: Field Work) and no doubt longsuffering editor Keith Walsh have excerpted an assortment of moments and passages from the final staged version that they’ve montaged nimbly together, although sometimes the music heard doesn’t correspond to the dancing seen. Mám lacks any kind of story, and its creation was more about process than product for choreographer Michael Keegan-Dolan and his ensemble, and so the film’s fragmentary, sliced-view approach works just fine. Keegan-Dolan, best known for his work in ballet and choreography for the Royal Opera House, explains to his collaborators near the start that he wants to make something that evades the usual hierarchies of dance, opening up a space for the performers to be as instrumental in the creative process as either Keegan-Dolan or his key collaborator Rachel Poirier (she’s also his wife). Meanwhile, just as essential to the process is the input from bravura concertina player Cormac Begley, who pulls together the score in a parallel collaboration with stargaze, a musical combo using traditional instruments to make a heady sound that’s closest to contemporary classical but with bits of jazz and folk thrown in.  For all the abstraction of the show, which involves animal masks, soft-shoe shuffling, manic twirling, and an interlude where dancer James Southward goes around snogging everyone on stage, there are some surprisingly emotional moments. For example, Keegan-Dolan enjoins the dancers to move as if they’re showing a beloved, dying relative everything about their craft in one frenzied performance, and this stirs up strong feelings. Elsewhere, Collins’s camera watches the catering team preparing to feed everyone as they work at the troupe’s rehearsal space in Kerry and that helps to enhance the sense of place that’s somehow embedded deep in the show’s own ineffable themes.  The Dance is in cinemas from 11 February.",Arts/Film,The Dance review – emotional study of Irish performers’ work in progress,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/the-dance-review-slow-cinema-maestro-offers-a-glimpse-behind-the-scenes
2/10/2022,"There are shades of Griffin Dunne’s underappreciated romantic comedy Addicted to Love in Amazon’s slick Valentine’s offering I Want You Back, stories of dumpees refusing to take no for an answer. But while there was a dark undercurrent disrupting the cutesy sight of Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick flirting in Manhattan way back when, the Big Time Adolescence director Jason Orley is less interested in the murk and keen, if not a little insistent, that his characters be liked, if not unconditionally loved.  It’s thus a far simpler, far more earnest film that one would expect from the spiky set-up that sees total strangers Peter (Charlie Day) and Emma (Jenny Slate) bond over being dumped at the same time, fixating on the exes who have moved on without them. Their upset quickly turns to anger when they discover that their former lovers have replaced them with newer, sexier alternatives, and so they hatch a plan to go undercover and destroy the burgeoning relationships. Peter becomes gym buddies with Emma’s ex Noah (Scott Eastwood) while Emma tries to come between Peter’s ex Anne (Gina Rodriguez) and her new beau Logan (Manny Jacinto). There’s something interestingly deluded and narcissistic about what drives the pair, a total denial of their immediate reality and a dogged insistence that they are better and more desirable than their exes’ new partners. It’s a heartbroken thought process that maybe some of us can vaguely relate to, but it’s the put-into-action plotting that elevates it into something wilder and less familiar. The combination of an R rating and the centering of two actors better known for playing comedy support than romantic leads would understandably have us expecting something riskier or raunchier, something closer to the Apatow-led boom in romcoms for adults. But the script, from the Love, Simon writers Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger, is too wary to really go there, playing it safe when some recklessness would be welcomed, a freak flag barely flying at half-mast. The uninventive schemes the two concoct are far too inoffensive and half-assed, and, especially on Day’s side, sometimes rather vague. There’s often not a clear reason why they’re doing what they’re doing, and a tighter, more carefully constructed script would have made us a little clearer on just what the point of so much of it is. Aptaker and Berger rely on a string of dog-eared comedy set pieces that we know too well at this stage – the drug scene, the threesome scene, the hiding in a bedroom scene, the karaoke scene, the club scene – and do very little to elevate them. The script feels a few punch-ups away from being as sharp and as funny as it could be, far too many lines falling flat, as if the first brainstormed joke (the “not this, but something like this” idea) was put in as a place-holder then they forgot to go back and change it (Eastwood’s character thinking that the line “get back on the horse” is “get back on the whores” is an example of a real clanger). In order for us to truly love the pair without reservation, Aptaker and Berger go to great, pained lengths to offset their deranged behaviour. The dream of Day’s character is to revolutionise retirement-home living (!) so we see him helping elderly people, while Slate’s character develops a friendship with a struggling middle-schooler who needs advice on dealing with a fractured parental situation. There’s such a strange reluctance to lean into the darkness at the film’s core that the script turns them into the nicest stalkers we’ve ever met, rather than something messier and more believable. It’s not the more interesting, and more amusing, film it could have been but even at a slightly stretched 111 minutes, it’s still consistently entertaining, thanks in large part to the cast, but also to Orley, who manages against all odds to make it look and feel almost like a glossy studio movie. Shot in early 2021 and hampered by Covid-19 restrictions, Orley does a nifty job at not clueing us into any of that (unlike so many other films made in the last two years) and together with an immensely charming throwback score from Siddhartha Khosla, it really does feel that much more alive than the majority of what’s come out since the Netflix romcom resurrection. Sitcom pros Jacinto and Rodriguez are both reliably strong, the latter allowed a more nuanced character arc than a film like this would often give her (refreshingly, neither the exes or their new partners are turned into easy villains). The deserved promotion of the leads from the sidelines to the main stage is a smooth transition, especially for Slate, a hugely capable comedic actor whose more recent projects haven’t always reflected her talent, something this film might hopefully shift. The one niggling issue, however, is that while Day and Slate make convincing beer-and-chips friends, sexual chemistry never really sparks, even in the last act, despite the script informing us of the power of the slow-burn romance. There’s a far better version of I Want You Back somewhere, a few script revisions in and maybe without that air-sucking Pete Davidson cameo, but even as it stands, it’s a far better version of a romantic comedy than we’re used to streaming of late.

And yet, though we cannot see them, many of these places have had formative influences on its history, and their disappearances begin to explain why Britain looks the way it does today.  Join Dr Matthew Green, as he guides you through key turning points in Britain’s history - the Black Death, Reformation, Enlightenment and more - and draws on four years of his original research to paint a vivid and detailed picture of a Britain that no longer exists. He will guide you through the sights, sounds and tribulations of vanished places, from the buried city of Trellech to the abandoned sea-mountain of St Kilda. Experience former settlements across the breadth of Britain and discover how these places came to meet their tragic fate. With the aid of striking maps, prints and photographs, Matthew will resurrect these lost towns and settlements, evoking their unique layouts and describing in dramatic detail the experiences of their former dwellers - many of whom tried, but failed, to resist the tides of change. This class will also explore how and why places are disappearing from Britain’s landscape today and what the past might reveal about the future.

2/10/2022,"Looking back on the 1990 ousting of Margaret Thatcher as Conservative prime minister, her chief whip Tim Renton concluded that Thatcher had lost power because she “had ceased having an open mind” about how to unify her party or to govern. “She only wanted to have her own friends around her and she had come to identify No 10 and the job of prime minister with herself,” wrote Renton. “Anyone who stood in her way … was to be dispensed with. They were not of the right faith.” Boris Johnson is not in the same league as Thatcher as a successful prime minister and much else. She lasted 11 years in Downing Street and won three general elections. He has been prime minister for two and half and has won just once. She possessed ideological conviction in spades. His only serious interest is in himself.  Yet all the evidence from the so-called reboot of Johnson’s government in the wake of the lockdown party scandals is that this prime minister is now making many of the same mistakes that Thatcher did more than a generation ago. Like her, Johnson surrounds himself with flatterers. Like her, he has come to identify the Conservative government with himself rather than the party or the electorate. Like her, he ostracises those who are not true believers – which in this case means believers in him. There are, of course, some differences. Yet the outcome will be the same. It would be hard to exaggerate the damage that ‘partygate’ has already done to Johnson. You can measure this in lots of ways: the drip-drip of backbenchers losing confidence, the mostly quiet (so far) ministerial resignations and departing advisers, and in the bad headlines – another photograph emerged today showing Johnson at a December 2020 party with a bottle of champagne. Never forget that, lurking in the wings, there is potentially the most threatening factor of them all: the police investigation into Downing Street parties and No 10’s false denials. Yet the most important evidence of how bad things have become is already in plain sight in election results and opinion polls. Johnson’s poll ratings today are truly dire. Indeed they are even worse today, in early February, than they were as recently as December, when the Conservatives suffered the humiliating loss of the North Shropshire byelection with a swing of 34% to the Liberal Democrats. According to Ipsos Mori polling, 65% of voters in Britain were already dissatisfied with Johnson back in December; today that figure stands at 70%. Even among Tory voters – of whom there are fewer to pick from now than before – dissatisfaction with Johnson went up from 28% to 34% in the same period. Another Ipsos Mori poll, conducted only a week ago, found just 14% of all voters think Johnson is an honest person (72% think he is not), while a mere 18% say he is a prime minister they can be proud of. He trails both Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak on one leadership yardstick after another. These are polling and voting figures from which leaders do not come back. The Conservative donor John Armitage is right that Johnson has not just lost moral authority – as these polls confirm. He has also lost his touch. But Johnson is also losing votes. The crunch moment is now the local elections on 5 May, in which the Tories are defending some previously strong performances when these seats were last contested, but in what is now a far more ominous political environment. One of Johnson’s “senior advisers” in No 10 was quoted in last Sunday’s papers as saying: “He’s making very clear that they’ll have to send a Panzer division to get him out of there.” This is recognisably the sort of overblown language that Johnson would use as he battles to hang on to his prime ministership. But it is also recognisable evidence of a state of denial about how the rules of politics – and of real life – tend to work. When Johnson has to go, it will not involve a tank division in Downing Street. It will happen for one of three reasons – because of law-breaking, electoral defeats or ministerial resignations (Sunak’s in particular) – or some mix of them. Johnson will try to brazen it out. But in the end all routes will lead through the parliamentary party. Even if Johnson survives a vote of confidence, he will not be able to continue long. Thatcher won the first round in 1990, but the tide against her was too strong. The same would happen today. This week’s reboot and reshuffle do precisely nothing to alter this. That’s partly because they were overshadowed by the fallout from Johnson’s incendiary comments about Jimmy Savile. But it is also because they involve such minimalist, low-key changes. Even sympathetic observers see this as rearranging the furniture. There is no real strategy there, beyond survival, and even that looks fragile. A whips’ office purge of the kind Johnson carried out this week is a particular sign of weakness. It squanders a lot of accumulated knowledge about the party’s MPs, which will not help an embattled prime minister facing a very divided party. Reshuffles without sackings show a prime minister who is afraid of his MPs. That the only policy-related job in the reshuffle – Brexit promotion – should go to Jacob Rees-Mogg suggests that Johnson’s main concern is to solidify his support on the Tory right. Johnson is now governing from one day to the next, making it up as he goes along. He is good at creating distractions – the technique is at the core of his politics – but he needs a lot of them to survive. Last week’s flurry of ministerial policy announcements was part of that. So was the reshuffle. A possible end to Covid restrictions, another pander to the Tory right, distracted from today’s potentially difficult prime minister’s questions. Today a trip to Poland will do the job. Hints of a bigger reshuffle in the summer may help keep ambitious MPs in line. A recess next week may gain Johnson a brief breathing space. There will be plenty of propaganda informing us that No 10 is feeling more assured about the future. It will all be worthless. A prime minister who tries to hide in the bunker is ultimately doomed. In the end, MPs care more about their seats and their party than they care about a particular prime minister. That was what 1990 showed. The same thing will happen here, though we may have to wait until May. It could prove to be the one and only instance in his life in which the rules really will apply to Boris Johnson.

I watched the Brit awards with my daughter and resolved not to make tart comments, because I remember, as a kid, finding my parents’ contributions on such matters excruciating. I was only eight when Bohemian Rhapsody came out. Even though I found the video a bit bewildering, I was still appalled when my mum said, “What’s this about killing a man? That’s rubbish that is.” As a massive Led Zeppelin devotee in my teens, I was agog when their concert film The Song Remains the Same came out on video. With only one television in the house, there was no privacy in those days; kids today don’t know how lucky they are. Sure enough, in came my dad, asking what exactly it was that Robert Plant had stuffed down the front of his extremely tight jeans, and why Jimmy Page was playing his electric guitar with a violin bow. Yes, I knew it was all a bit ridiculous, but these men were my idols and I couldn’t bear having the suspension of my disbelief dismantled so brutally.  And here was I, with the opportunity to disrupt the repeating of history, to be better than my own father – so of course I blew it. I just couldn’t help myself. Here are some things that I said: “Why’s everyone wearing those big clumpy shoes?”, “What’s this Mo [Gilligan] bloke all about?”, “Who on earth is Dave?”, “Adele’s having herself these days, isn’t she?”, “It’s all a fix anyway”. I ended up getting on my own nerves, as well as hers, so I left the room and went elsewhere to berate myself for being a grumpy old fool. When I returned, the aforementioned Dave was on, performing with a gospel choir. It was wonderful. I told my daughter as much, but it was too late to redeem myself.

2/10/2022,"In the dock in both of his trials – both for murder, both of women he had professed to love – Ian Stewart cut an unimpressive figure. Shabby, hesitant, inexplicably dull – he seemed unremarkable in every way. On Wednesday the 61-year-old was unmasked as a serial killer, found guilty of the murder of his wife Diane five years after being convicted of the 2016 murder of his fiancee Helen Bailey.  In 2017 a jury found Stewart guilty of killing Bailey, a children’s author, after hearing that while she was planning their wedding he drugged and suffocated her. After the murder he dumped her body, and that of her beloved dachshund, in a Victorian cesspit in the grounds of their home in Royston, Hertfordshire, so he could inherit her £4m fortune. It was only after his arrest that alarm bells were raised about the fate of Diane, who died at home in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, in 2010. At the time, her death was recorded as sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP), after Stewart said he found his wife collapsed in the garden. But over three weeks a jury at Huntingdon crown court was unconvinced of his insistence that the pair “were in love, very happy” and that he had desperately tried to save her life. The court heard that he made several delays before ringing 999 on 25 June 2010. He did mouth to mouth, which he said “exhausted” him, then he went to “try to get help” from a doctor and a nurse who lived opposite. He said he tried CPR again before finally ringing the emergency services. The jury heard a recording of the call, in which Stewart could be heard counting along with the emergency call handler, apparently using the resuscitation techniques described to him. But the paramedic who attended the scene said Stewart was “initially distracted, idly pacing” when help arrived. He wasn’t crying, screaming or upset but “appeared dissociative and was simply answering questions calmly.” There were no signs of the bodily trauma that normally accompanied the administering of effective CPR, he added. Twenty minutes after the ambulance arrived, Diane was pronounced dead. Alexandra Bailey, who studied with Diane at Salford University in the 1980s, said in a statement that Stewart “seemed totally unbothered and seemed quite aloof” at her friend’s funeral. Stewart’s 90-year-old father, Keith, put the lack of emotion shown by Stewart down to a long-term muscle condition. “I don’t think he’s capable of doing something like that,” he said of the murder charge. Diane’s sister, Wendy Bellamy-Lee, said she had harboured an “element of suspicion”, heightened after Stewart got angry when she called the coroner’s office days after Diane’s death. “He was so cross with me. Then I felt really bad that I had done that and I had to tell him,” she said. After Diane’s death, Stewart received £96,000 in inheritance, which he said was for their sons’ future. He bought a red two-seater MG and said the purchase was in her memory. But he did not do the probate paperwork for another £50,000 he could have claimed. The prosecution barrister Stuart Trimmer – who also prosecuted Stewart’s first trial – suggested this was because he had already met Bailey. Stewart’s son Jamie, who was 18 when Diane died, told the court that at the end of that year Stewart met someone in an online bereavement group. As he settled into his new life it must have seemed to Stewart that he would never face consequences for what he had done. Diane’s body had been cremated, and a full toxicology had not been done as part of the 2010 postmortem examination. But one vital clue to the murder remained – Diane had donated brain tissue for medical research. Upon re-examination, a neuropathologist said it showed signs that “breathing had been restricted” for between 35 minutes and an hour before her death. A consultant neurologist estimated the risk of the 47-year-old having had a fatal epileptic seizure at about one in 100,000. Another expert said he would have expected to see injuries on the outside of the body of someone who had fallen on concrete during a seizure. Stewart denied having had Diane cremated to destroy evidence, arguing that if that was the case he would not have agreed to keep her brain and heart. He denied being “a man capable of extreme and callous violence” and said his relationship with his wife had been “too perfect really, too good.” But his protestations – and the picture Stewart painted to the outside world of a “caring and gentle” husband who was part of a “nice family unit” – were a lying charade, the jury decided. Over the course of the trial, the web of deceit that had been hanging together by a thread unravelled entirely. Already serving a life sentence for Bailey’s murder, he will now spend the rest of his life behind bars after being handed a whole-life term, meaning he will not be considered for release.",News/UK news,How brain tissue donation helped unravel Ian Stewart’s web of lies,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/ian-stewart-helen-bailey-diane-stewart-brain-tissue-donation-web-of-lies

Jana Bennett was completely different, operating with human warmth and kindness. When I lost my job as head of community and disability programmes in 1998, it was Jana who set about finding a new role for me. Knowing I was on the verge of quitting, she offered me a succession of posts, all of which I turned down, still furious at the way I had been treated. It was Jana’s sixth and final offer that did the trick.  I was touched that Jana had gone to such lengths to help. She conveyed the impression that she regarded me highly, and that the BBC did so too, for which I will always feel affectionate gratitude.",News/Media,Letter: Jana Bennett obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/09/letter-jana-bennett-obituary
2/10/2022,"My partner is going to start chemotherapy in a couple of days. It will last six months. He spends a lot of time with his family on the phone talking, laughing, sharing the way he feels with his brother, his sister and his mother … I feel very lonely. It feels like I am just here to do the cleaning, the shopping, the driving to hospital, etc. I don’t know what to do. Should I tell him the way I feel? I don’t want to hurt him. I went through cancer before I met him. I survived, but my then-relationship did not.  Eleanor says: Grief counsellors sometimes talk about the concentric circles around tragedy. There’s the person in the centre, to whom the thing actually happens, then one circle out there are the loved ones and close relatives who will wear the marks of the tragedy for a long time. Then there are the distant friends or relatives, and so on out by degrees until we get to colleagues or friends of friends. It’s meant to be a guide to who asks what of whom: while everyone in the circle feels shaken, we’re meant to send comfort inwards – to the smaller circles – and fear or frustration outwards. The teacher of a suddenly ill child gets to be teary over how confronting it is, but probably not on the phone to that child’s parents. Comfort in, worry out. It would be easy to think of yourself as in the second circle immediately around your partner. But I want to encourage you to think that you deserve your own circle. There are two distinct stressful experiences coming your way here – one as the partner of someone suffering, and the other as a caregiver. In the first, you’ll be with your partner’s friends and family, all oriented around the shock of his diagnosis and treatment. In the second, you’re entitled to a separate support network – made up of your relatives and friends, where the fact at the centre is that caregiving is stressful. Because caregiving is stressful. You’ve already mentioned cleaning, shopping, driving to the hospital – and that says nothing of the emotional experience. Caregivers can wind up feeling like a plus-one to some of the hardest events they’ve experienced. If you can create support for your experience – not just the one you’re having as part of an “us” – that loneliness you describe might ebb. You might even find you need different things in each role. As a partner you might want help processing how illness affects your relationship; as a caregiver you might need the exact opposite – a moment where no-one talks about your partner. You asked whether you should say anything to him. It’s difficult to say, not knowing the rest of your dynamic. I will say that people battling illnesses often keep the lowest-energy parts of their day to the people they love the most. It’s easy to see someone lighting up on the phone and feel confused or even resentful – “why aren’t they that vibrant with me?” – when in fact, their willingness to not be that way with you shows they trust you enough to not be “on”. If you want to, you can share your feelings honestly, without asking him to solve them. Just be sure to recruit as much help as you can from outside the relationship to solve the trials that occur within it. That means vocally asking for assistance in both the stressful roles these months will force you into – naming specific things others can do to assist; acknowledging to yourself that it is legitimate to ask. You and your partner face a big challenge. If you can meet the needs you have as separate people, you might be better able to help each other with the ones you’ll face together.

2/10/2022,"The exponential rise of renewable energy led to it providing more than 30% of Australia’s electricity in 2021, while gas-fired power fell to its lowest level in 16 years. Data collected by OpenNEM, an open source platform, shows renewable energy provided 31.4% of electricity within the national market covering the eastern states and South Australia last year. It was 32.2% in the separate West Australian grid.  The national figure has quickly surged beyond the national renewable energy target, which required electricity retailers to sell about 23% of generation from solar, wind and hydro plants by 2020. Gas-fired power – which is being backed by the Morrison government through hundreds of millions of dollars in funding as part of what it calls a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic – has fallen to its lowest level of generation since 2005. It now provides just 5.7% of the total. Its decline from a high of 12.8% seven years ago is largely attributed to its relatively high cost and the sharp increase in the amount of cheaper solar and wind energy available. Coal-fired power provides 62.8% of electricity, its lowest level in both proportion and total amount since the interconnected national market began in 1999. Back then, it was 95.4% of grid generation. Tim Baxter, a senior researcher with the Climate Council, said renewable energy had increased exponentially since 2018, when it was about 20% of the total share. The surge had initially been largely driven by a rush to fill the national renewable energy target, which the Morrison government did not extend or replace. It had continued due to the plunging cost of solar and wind, state-based renewables schemes and corporates increasingly promising support for zero-emissions energy. “Electricity is now the cheapest it has been in almost a decade, and we have solar and wind to thank for that,” Baxter said. The most significant rise has been in household solar systems. More than 3m homes have photovoltaic panels, including at least 360,000 systems installed last year, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. Regulators say that has created some new grid management challenges as solar energy floods into the system and makes other forms of generation uncompetitive when the sun is high in the middle of the day. Solar energy provided 12.3% of electricity generated in the national market. Nearly two-thirds of that came from rooftops, the rest from large-scale farms. Wind contributed 11.3% of electricity and hydro power 7.8%. In contrast, gas-fired power had declined due to it being the most expensive electricity fuel available. Baxter said while there may be some year-to-year variation, the fall in its use for power was expected to continue as other “dispatchable” sources that could be called on when required became available. They included pumped hydro, batteries, virtual power plants and demand response programs. Baxter said it made the government’s support for gas power – including $600m for a new gas-fired generator at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley and another four listed for potential public underwriting – look “increasingly irresponsible and economically reckless”. “Let’s be clear, this record [of solar and wind lowering electricity prices] has nothing to do with the federal government, which has been missing in action and leaving all the heavy lifting to the states and territories,” he said. The Kurri Kurri gas plant, to be built by the public owned Snowy Hydro company, has been criticised as unnecessary to ensure a secure electricity supply is maintained once the nearby Liddell coal plant shuts next year. Kerry Schott, the former head of the Energy Security Board, was among those who said a new gas plant in the Hunter did not make commercial sense given there were cheaper and cleaner alternatives, but the head of Snowy Hydro, Paul Broad, this week predicted the country would continue to build “a lot more” gas-fired stations. Federal Labor last week said if it won the upcoming federal election it would require the Kurri Kurri station to run on 30% green hydrogen made with renewable energy when it opened next year, and 100% green hydrogen as soon as possible. Chris Bowen, the opposition energy and climate spokesman, said this could cost up to another $700m, inflating the potential total to $1.3bn. Green hydrogen has been widely backed as a significant future energy source as the world cuts greenhouse gas emissions, but some experts have ranked electricity generation near the bottom of its likely commercially viable uses. It is seen as important in creating “green” steel, aluminium and ammonia, among other products. Labor has also promised a $20 billion off-budget “rewiring the nation corporation” to accelerate the construction of planned electricity grid links. Modelling for the opposition by the firm RepuTex suggested it could lead to renewable energy providing 82% of electricity by 2030, compared with 68% on the current trajectory under the federal Coalition. The Greens say the country should be aiming for 100%.",News/Australia news,Gas-fired power falls to lowest level since 2005 as Coalition pushes ahead with its ‘gas-fired recovery’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/gas-fired-power-falls-to-lowest-level-since-2005-as-coalition-pushes-ahead-with-its-gas-fired-recovery

The amount includes the biggest penalty to date for breaking Australian spam laws, of $2.5m, with the remainder made up by refunds Sportsbet has agreed to pay to customers who made bets after receiving the unwanted marketing messages.  It comes as financial counsellors and suicide prevention experts have called for a complete ban on gambling advertising. About 37,000 consumers received the Sportsbet spam, which was sent between January 2020 and March 2021 and offered either incentives to gamble or alerts about upcoming races, the Australian Communications and Media Authority said. Acma said the company, a subsidiary of Irish betting behemoth Flutter Entertainment, also sent 3,000 marketing texts that did not include a way to unsubscribe. The company continued to send spam after Acma contacted it, authority chair Nerida O’Loughlin said. “The Acma contacted Sportsbet on several occasions leading up to the investigation to let the gambling provider know it may have compliance problems and it failed to take adequate action. “Sportsbet is a large and sophisticated company which should have robust systems in place to comply with spam laws and protect the interests of its customers.” As part of a court-enforceable undertaking, Sportsbet has agreed to appoint an independent person to oversee refunds and monitor its compliance with anti-spam laws. A spokesperson said: “Sportsbet accepts the Acma’s findings and apologises to customers who were affected by this issue.” “The non-compliance resulted from technical and systems failures that regrettably meant not all customer unsubscribe requests were actioned in a timely manner. “Sportsbet suspended all email marketing for several months and implemented extensive system upgrades to ensure that all unsubscribe requests are now correctly actioned.” The company takes the issue seriously and “is committed to ensuring that past failings are not repeated”, the spokesperson said. In a report released on Wednesday, Suicide Prevention Australia and Financial Counselling Australia said the lack of regulation of marketing to VIP customers and inducements to gamble posed “harmful risks to people who have trouble managing their gambling”, particularly when combined with companies’ ability to mine personal data to target individuals. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Advertising is a major contributor to gambling harm,” Lauren Levin, director of policy and campaigns at Financial Counselling Australia, said. “People trying to stop can’t get away from it.

We did it with tobacco.” The report, Gambling and Suicide Prevention: A road map for change, also found that gambling harm is being overlooked in police investigations and coronial processes in possible cases of suicide. Banks should also act to reduce gambling harm, including banning debt-funded gambling (with credit cards, for instance), and gambling companies themselves should establish “proactive harm minimisation, staff training and operational protocols”, the report says. “We need government to step up,” Levin said. “The fix is not a bit of tinkering. The fix is a cohesive gambling harm prevention plan. The gambling suicide problem is not going away. It is growing.

2/10/2022,"The Coalition has ramped up its pre-election attack on Labor over national security, while new documents show how concerned the Australian government was about China’s widening trade bans as the diplomatic relationship soured. At the height of the tensions, coal industry figures told the Australian government Beijing’s ban on supply from Australia was fuelling “elevated uncertainty”, especially because it was unclear how long the disruption would last.  Briefings to the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, also warned that Beijing had “effectively eliminated Australian barley as a feasible option for Chinese importers” and that Australia’s wine industry had struggled to divert to other markets. Guardian Australia obtained the briefings after a freedom of information battle with Treasury surrounding the economic impact of trade actions taken by Australia’s largest trading partner – an issue that is likely to feature in the looming election campaign. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, told parliament on Wednesday that his government would “continue to stand up for Australia’s values in the face of threats and coercion” and “we’ll never have an each-way bet”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, followed up by saying any voters who were “worried” about China or Russia “wouldn’t vote for Labor at the next election” – despite the opposition offering broad bipartisan support on foreign affairs and national security issues. The comments come after Labor accused the government of a “dangerous ploy” to pretend there are substantial differences between the main parties when it comes to China. Treasury initially blocked the public release of the advice it prepared for Frydenberg about the economic impact of the trade tensions, fearing the disclosure could cause damage to the diplomatic relationship and “prejudice future trade discussions involving China”. But it later agreed to release 28 documents, produced between January and September 2021, after a successful request for an internal review of the FoI decision. The documents provide an insight into what Frydenberg was told about China’s trade actions – which hit a range of sectors including barley, wine, coal, seafood, timber and red meat – and how he should respond to questions in parliament. A 2021-22 budget issues brief to Frydenberg said: “While the ongoing trade restrictions with China have had significant impacts on specific firms and regions, most goods targeted by the restrictions have so far been successfully redirected to other export markets, though often at lower prices.” It added: “Consultation with market and industry participants, however, has highlighted that there is elevated uncertainty in the coal market, in particular around the duration of the Chinese restrictions on Australian coal, as well as around global environmental policies.” China’s informal ban on Australian coal came to a head in late 2020 when dozens of ships carrying Australian coal were left waiting at sea – some for months – to offload their cargo at Chinese ports. Jo Clarke, an associate editor for Argus, a global commodity and energy publication, said the vast majority of ships that were waiting outside Chinese ports were diverted to alternate non-Chinese ports. She said a few of the ships were allowed to discharge Australian coal on humanitarian grounds so that the crews could return home. “All the coal that had been discharged has now been given customs clearance to be released from the ports, but no new Australian coal is being allowed into China,” Clarke said. The latest figures suggest Australia exported no thermal coal to China in 2021, compared with 35m tonnes in 2020 and 50m tonnes in 2019. The shortfall was offset by increases in shipments to India, Japan and South Korea. The resources minister, Keith Pitt, said Australia’s coal industry had “shown tremendous resilience”. “Australia remains open to talks with China on resuming exports, including coal, that would be of mutual benefit to both countries,” Pitt said. The budget issues brief to Frydenberg catalogued “a range of complex trade issues between Australia and China”. They included formal actions – such as tariffs, suspensions and increased testing of goods on arrival – along with informal measures such as quotas or unofficial instructions to Chinese buyers. The document said Beijing’s 80% tariffs on Australian barley – announced in May 2020 and now subject to a World Trade Organization challenge – had “effectively eliminated Australian barley as a feasible option for Chinese importers, and exports to China effectively ceased after the tariff’s introduction”. “Despite trade restrictions from Australian barley export volumes were up 176% through the year in March quarter 2021 … due to higher production resulting from favourable seasonal conditions in 2020.” But the Australian wine industry – also hit by tariffs – found it more difficult to divert to other markets. This transition “has been faster and lower-cost for barley exports than for wine”, according to a Treasury economic note in June 2021. A briefing to prepare Frydenberg for an interview in May 2021 suggested he emphasise Australia’s “mutually beneficial trading relationship with China” if asked whether the government was concerned about the actions. “We are concerned about trade disruption,” those talking points said, while adding that the impact of China’s actions on Australia’s overall economy “has been limited”. That view was reflected in Frydenberg’s public statements about the Australian economy’s “resilience” in the face of sharp “pressure”. The documents also show how Frydenberg was briefed for parliamentary question time throughout the course of last year, including to say the government had “sought assurances from China that trade will occur in a timely, transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable manner”. A question time brief, prepared in January 2021, suggested to say the government was “deepening Australia’s economic partnerships with a range of countries” if asked what it was doing to mitigate the damage. The question time brief also stated the Australian government “will always protect our national interests, first and foremost”. Officials suggested Frydenberg note both Australia and China have “benefitted greatly from our trade relationship” and “without this, we both lose”. A question time brief in August 2021 played down a story in Chinese state media that suggested Chinese steel exports to Australia had dropped “more than 50% in recent months” and that this would hurt Australia’s economy. “This potential fall in steel exports reflects China’s broader policies to reduce emissions and curb steel prices – it is not targeted at Australia specifically,” the brief said.",News/Business,Coalition boasts of tough line on China but documents reveal private fears on trade,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/coalition-boasts-of-tough-line-on-china-but-documents-reveal-private-fears-on-trade
2/10/2022,"Annie O’Brien’s first thought was that the frog in their shower had eaten a lip balm. Her two boys had raised the alarm about the “funny-shaped” green tree frog – one of several that had taken up residence in their Balgal Beach home near Townsville in Queensland.  Further investigation revealed a foam Nerf gun dart had become lodged inside the family’s resident amphibian. Check out the video of a #Townsville vet nurse retrieving a toy that was swallowed by a green tree #frog. 🐸 Read more about the froggo's adventure>> https://t.co/dKAw3W39GT #TownsvilleShines @tsv_bulletin pic.twitter.com/arBt1aAIgf “I grew up in the UK so when you see things like this you go, ‘oh my god, that’s so wild,’ but when you live in Australia for 20 years, it’s like ‘oh god, what are we doing with this frog at 9 o’clock at night?’” she said. “I thought we really need to do the right thing by this frog because we’ve obviously contributed to this.” A quick internet search and late-night call to snake handler Trish Prendergast resulted in a trip to the emergency room to get the frog some help. Prendergast, a senior veterinary nurse and reptile coordinator for the North Queensland Wildlife Centre, said the Nerf dart had become stuck diagonally inside. Using a teaspoon to pry open its mouth, Prendergast was able to remove the dart which was about the same length as the frog’s body. “You would be surprised at what they shove in their mouths,” Prendergast said. “There would have been a bug or something on or next to the Nerf dart, so it’s gone for the bug, pounced on it to eat it and shoved the Nerf dart into its mouth.” When the O’Brien family moved in to their Balgal Beach home two years ago, they quickly learned it came with several amphibious housemates. “And I’m sure more have moved in since,” O’Brien said. “They come out at night. They don’t worry you at all, though this one obviously bit off more than he could chew.” Since then her two boys, Cooper, 9, and Callum, 7, have adopted the frogs as pets, with each one getting a different name every week. When they found the frog in trouble, they knew they had to help. When frogs eat something they shouldn’t, they don’t regurgitate it like humans. When they accidentally eat a living wasp or poisonous insect, they will push their stomach out of their mouth like a pocket turned inside out, “scoop out” the offending object and then swallow their stomach again, Prendergast said. However, in this case the dart was lodged diagonally, meaning the frog wouldn’t have been able to do that and would have likely died without intervention. Prendergast said the incident was a reminder to keep litter and other objects away from wildlife. Prendergastand fellow snake catcher Jeremy often get called out to rescue animals that have become entangled or trapped in litter such as plastic bags, or in one case a tennis ball. On Tuesday night she said they received a call to rescue an eastern brown snake that had been caught in an empty beer can after hunting a family of mice. Having swallowed the mice that had been nesting in the can, it had become trapped and had to be cut free. O’Brien said the green tree frog had been “reinstated” to the shower and appeared to be happy, healthy and trouble-free. “The whole thing was funny and then watching the video back again is just like: that poor frog, what it’s been through,” O’Brien said. “Hopefully it doesn’t have a long memory; hopefully it remembers not to eat nerf darts, but hopefully it doesn’t remember the trauma.”",News/Australia news,‘Bit off more than he could chew’: Nerf gun dart removed from Queensland family’s resident frog,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/bit-off-more-than-he-could-chew-nerf-gun-dart-removed-from-queensland-familys-resident-frog
2/10/2022,"Australians with urgent but non life-threatening medical conditions have been prevented from accessing bulk-billed telehealth consults during the pandemic because they do not have a regular GP. Anna Blair* suffers from chronic health conditions including regular, painful urinary tract infections that require urgent treatment. But she has found the rules around telehealth appointments to be more “frustrating” and “annoying” than helpful.  To help prevent the spread of Covid the government made changes to allow telehealth appointments to be bulk-billed, encouraging patients to avoid physically attending a GP practice. But patients can only be bulk-billed for telehealth if they have seen their regular GP or another health professional at the same practice, face-to-face in the 12 months prior. Blair could not see her regular Sydney GP when she began experiencing symptoms, including urinating blood and a burning sensation, because the doctor was on medical leave. No appointments with other practitioners at the clinic were available. The condition commonly requires a script for antibiotics, and delaying this treatment can lead to the infection spreading to the bladder or kidneys. Blair found a different clinic with appointments available, but was told that because she had not attended the clinic before, she could not access bulk-billed telehealth. “The telehealth rules have the biggest impact when you need same-day care and can’t get into your regular practice,” Blair said. “It prompts you to either delay seeking care, which can have major consequences when it’s infection-related, or pay big gap fees elsewhere for simple appointments.” The president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Karen Price, said the 12-month rule was in place to help established, accredited GP practices provide better care and to stop opportunistic, digital-only “dial-a-doc” practices emerging just to “click over a high volume of appointments as fast as possible”. But she said “we do need some more commonsense flexibility” in the telehealth rules. Price has written to the department of health saying that the 12-month rule is affecting immunocompromised GPs and patients in particular. The letter said that immunocompromised GPs, and GPs caring for immunocompromised family members, should not be forced to see patients face-to-face even after 12 months due to the increased risk Covid presents to them. “While the number of immunocompromised GPs or those caring for immunocompromised family is low, the current demand for general practice care is unprecedented – requiring flexibility of rules that were established at a time when the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was unknown,” the letter said. “While GPs furloughing can see patients via telehealth, the strict application of the 12-month rule means that they are often precluded from seeing some patients via telehealth, despite the fact the patient is known to the GP and the practice.” Guardian Australia has contacted the department of health for comment.

2/10/2022,"When Perth festival opens on Friday, it will be a very different program to the one announced in November, with five major shows cancelled or postponed due to Western Australia’s Covid-19 border restrictions, including the festival’s free opening weekend event. The event’s executive director, Nathan Bennett, said the decision to cancel Escape, the opening weekend event, was made after management ruled the production could not go ahead in a Covid-safe way.  A celebration of the culture of the Noongar people, Escape would have been staged in various parks, wharves, warehouses and beachfronts this weekend. “An event of that scale has unrecoverable costs and we were very keen to ensure that we could honour our commitments to suppliers even though we’re cancelling the event,” Bennett said. Despite the cancellations, the festival’s management and board nevertheless considered themselves to be in a fortunate position, he said. “We’re the lucky ones because we’ve been in a position where we are able to plan a festival and do so with full knowledge that we might have to adapt our plans, change, or cancel things altogether,” he said. “That’s far better than what would have been the least risky decision, which would be to not plan a festival at all. I think that would have been an even worse outcome for the artists that we’ve managed to keep employed.” At least six productions and events at risk of cancellation have been salvaged, after a number of performers from outside WA secured special dispensation from the state’s chief health officer, allowing them to cross the border and complete a two-week quarantine before taking to the stage. Among those to receive exemptions are singer Katie Noonan and comedian Oliver Twist, who are both arriving with shows fresh from this year’s Sydney festival. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Members of the Queensland-based dance and theatre collective The Farm have been granted entry, in comfortable time for The Ninth Wave – their joint work with Perth troupe The Co3 Contemporary Dance company, to go ahead in early March. Melbourne-based artist Joel Bray has been granted entry in time for his one-man show Daddy. The immersive theatre installation Patch’s Lighthouse and dance work And the Earth Will Swallow Them Whole will also proceed as planned. But Fremantle concerts by Melbourne band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, and Sydney rap artist Barkaa have been cancelled, while the West Australian Opera’s performances of Carmen, the festivals’s flagship opera, will not go ahead on 25 and 26 February Launching the 2022 program in November, festival artistic director, Iain Grandage, said at the time he was hopeful border restrictions would be lifted by early February. The following month the state premier, Mark McGowan, flagged a 5 February reopening of WA’s borders, six days before the festival’s opening night. But McGowan backtracked in late January, announcing that the borders would remain closed to quarantine-free travel due to the spread of the Omicron variant, and would remain so until at least mid March. Bennett said the total cancellation of the Perth festival was an option canvased by the board as early as April 2020, when lockdowns and border closures began sweeping across the country. “There’s been so much uncertainty to navigate, but our board took a very clear, swift view that we needed to carry on and we needed to carry on in a safe way. The option of not planning a festival at all was ruled out very quickly,” he said",News/Australia news,Perth festival 2022 prepares for opening weekend despite border closures and cancellations,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/perth-festival-2022-prepares-for-opening-weekend-despite-border-closures-and-cancellations
2/10/2022,"Two newly approved oral treatments for Covid-19 are recommended mainly for unvaccinated patients and will not be available for Australia’s general practitioners to prescribe for “many, many weeks”. The antiviral drugs Lagevrio and Paxlovid block the ability of the Sars-CoV-2 virus to replicate in the body, and were provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration on 20 January.  The treatments can only be given to adults with mild to moderate Covid-19, who do not yet require oxygen, and must be administered within five days of when symptoms begin. The federal government secured 500,000 treatment courses of Paxlovid and 300,000 courses of Lagevrio for use this year. Amid global supply constraints, distribution of the antivirals has begun via the National Medical Stockpile – a reserve of pharmaceuticals and PPE managed by the federal government for use during public health emergencies. Australia’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Michael Kidd, said the treatments would be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) “in the coming months”. PBS listing is required for GPs to be able to prescribe the antivirals. “As supply of these treatments comes into the country, the initial distribution is going to need to be prioritised to those who are at the highest clinical need,” Kidd said. “They’ll go to residential aged care facilities, to rural and remote communities – particularly those regions with high Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations – and directly to the state and territory governments for distribution to those at highest risk in the community, including people with disability.” Lagevrio would be placed in residential aged care facilities as soon as possible, Kidd said. Paxlovid – which has numerous drug contraindications that may make it unsuitable for elderly patients on other medications – will be distributed to state and territory health authorities. Dr Karen Price, the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, said: “Prescription using a normal prescription pad is many, many, many weeks off at this stage.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Associate professor Paul Griffin, the director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services, said GPs would eventually “have a huge role to play” in prescribing the antivirals, but it was too early to know exactly how distribution would occur. “There’s no question that – given these are oral [medications] and need to be given early – they’re very much going to be community focused,” Griffin said. “We know that GPs are the backbone of healthcare in that setting.” Clinical guidelines for both antiviral drugs – which health experts emphasise are not a substitute for Covid vaccination – specify a focus on at-risk unvaccinated adults. Clinical trials of both drugs found they reduced hospitalisation and deaths in people with Covid-19 when given within five days of the onset of symptoms. However, trials did not include individuals who were partially or fully vaccinated. “These medicines were trialled before the vaccine was widely distributed,” Griffin said. The antivirals are also recommended for people who are immunosuppressed or “have received one or two doses of vaccine and who are at high risk of severe disease on the basis of age and multiple risk factors”. “People who have not been vaccinated remain at the highest risk,” Kidd said. “Treatments will most likely be of most benefit to people aged 60 and above, and those who have significant medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease, chronic lung disease or cancer.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Dr Diego Silva, a senior lecturer in bioethics at the University of Sydney, said providing the treatments to unvaccinated people aligned with the goal of treating people “at highest risk of progressing to serious disease”. Criticisms that unvaccinated people “didn’t do anything to protect themselves, [so] why should they get priority or why should they have equal access” run counter to the purpose of universal healthcare, Silva said. Healthcare was set up to “treat you no matter whether you’re at ‘fault’ or not,” he said. Griffin agreed. “If people have made a decision not to be vaccinated, whilst I certainly wouldn’t endorse that decision, our role when they get Covid … is to do everything we can to stop them getting unwell,” he said. “In medicine, our role is not to be judgmental.” Prof Trent Twomey, the president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, on Tuesday welcomed the first lot of antiviral deliveries from the National Medical Stockpile, but said more needed to be done to secure additional doses amid global supply chain shortages. “We look forward to working with government on getting more detail around when the Covid oral treatments will be listed on the PBS and can start rolling out to communities around the country,” he said.

2/10/2022,"Small towns with high Indigenous populations and western Sydney suburbs that are home to the most socioeconomically disadvantaged residents in the city bore the brunt of Covid fines during the ramp-up in enforcement during last year’s Delta outbreak. A Guardian analysis of data obtained by the Redfern Legal Centre under freedom of information laws shows that small towns including Walgett, Brewarrina and Wilcannia had the most fines per capita over the entire outbreak.  Approximately six people out of 100 in Walgett were fined for Covid breaches, according to the data, with Brewarrina seeing five in 100 residents fined and Wilcannia, with a population of 956 people, seeing over four in 100 people fined. Areas with greater socioeconomic disadvantage had higher rates of fines per 1,000 people on average. The most advantaged suburbs had a rate three times less than the most disadvantaged suburbs. Only two suburbs in the state were hit with more than $1m in fines between July and October last year: Liverpool and Mount Druitt in Sydney’s west. Residents in Blacktown were hit with almost $730,000 in fines. The figures are much larger compared with many wealthier eastern and inner west suburbs, such as Bondi, which was hit with $83,900 in fines in the same period, or Rozelle, which was hit with just $43,200. The suburbs facing larger amounts of fines are some of the most diverse in the country, with large First Nations communities, and where residents faced tough Covid restrictions including a curfew and limits on travel. The suburbs are also home to a high percentage of people from low socioeconomic backgrounds, with the median weekly income in Blacktown $633 according to the last census. Overall, the data reveals a massive ramp-up in fines issued across the state during the 2021 outbreak compared to the previous financial year. The total number of fines issued in the 2020/21 financial year stood at 1,818, compared to the 48,078 fines issued between July and October 2021. The stark difference between the fines faced by suburbs further west illustrates some of the criticisms made of the policing of Covid breaches during the Delta outbreak. The fines came during a time where many in NSW were struggling under tough lockdown restrictions, with businesses closed and families separated, specifically for the 12 “local government areas of concern” in Western Sydney. The government had also deployed hundreds of military personnel during that time, joining police in enforcing the lockdown rules. NSW police’s acting assistant commissioner, Peter Glynn, said the public health orders were in place “for a reason.” “The rapid spread of the virus caused the health orders to continually evolve, resulting in LGAs of concern nominated by NSW Health. The NSW government and NSW Health both sought an urgent police response to ensure the highest level of compliance with the health orders in those areas. “The public health orders have been in place for a reason, to ensure as many people as possible are protected from serious illness or even death.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Redfern Legal Centre’s police accountability solicitor, Samantha Lee, said the data showed that some suburbs and regions in NSW were more policed than others. “There is no doubt that those who were over-policed before Covid were just policed more during the pandemic, and there was an incredible imbalance when it came to the enforcement of orders and the policing of different suburbs.” Lee said the fines could sometimes amount to between $1,000 and $5,000 for an individual, figures that become difficult to pay in low socioeconomic suburbs hit hard by the lockdown. “The fines really do discriminate against people from low socioeconomic backgrounds, or those who have a low income, because they are not means-tested.” Lee said the public health orders were changed over 70 times in that period, making it harder for residents and police officers to keep up, resulting in many people being fined incorrectly. She said the government needed to “take a look” at the ways Covid rules were enforced during the pandemic, and called on the fines to be voided for those facing dire economic or social circumstances.",News/Australia news,‘Incredible imbalance’: NSW Covid fines during Delta higher in disadvantaged suburbs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2022/feb/10/incredible-imbalance-nsw-covid-fines-during-delta-higher-in-disadvantaged-suburbs
2/10/2022,"If back at the end of 2019 someone was to tell you that just over two years later we would be debating when will the unemployment rate go below 4%, you would have been excused for thinking that the number of employed must have surged a lot faster than it actually has. Prior to 2020 employment was growing around 4.2% every two years, so you would have been excused from thinking to get unemployment down so low, job growth must have taken off and we would be well above 13.5 million people employed.  And yet, no. Employment since the end of 2019 has increased just 2.1% – in effect at half the speed it had been in the period up to the pandemic: If the graph does not display please click here The level of employment is around 2.2% below what would have been expected, but the key thing to remember is that the unemployment rate is a percentage (the ABC’s Gareth Hutchens has some funky videos explaining this). It is related to the number of people in the labour force – and one of the big changes since the pandemic is the absence of migration has meant the pool of working age people has barely grown at all: If the graph does not display please click here And thus with a barely growing labour force, employment does not need to grow as fast in order to see unemployment fall. As it is, the level of unemployment is well below what would have been expected a couple of years ago: If the graph does not display please click here This does not mean it is irrelevant that unemployment is low, just that it is always worth remembering the current labour market is weird and in some ways artificial – not just due to the limit on migration but also due to the massive level of fiscal and monetary stimulus that is pumping up demand. The last time the unemployment rate fell to 4.0% in 2008 we were still benefiting from the mining boom, the GFC had yet to arrive, the budget was in surplus and the Reserve Bank of Australia had increased interest rates seven times in three years to take the heat out of the economy: If the graph does not display please click here We are not in such a situation now, and neither are we in a situation as was the case when the unemployment last had a 3 in front of it – back in the November quarter of 1974. It is quite remarkable how greatly our labour force has changed since then – a time so far removed that the ABS didn’t even do monthly unemployment figures! The first big change is that our labour force is older now. In 1974, 45% of our working-age population was under 35; now it is just 33%: If the graph does not display please click here But the biggest difference is the gender makeup. And it explains somewhat why unemployment was so low then – ironically it was for an artificial reason as is currently the case. While our current labour force is restricted by migration limits, back in 1974 it was restricted by both laws and conventions that kept women out of work. In 1974 just 35% of those in the labour force were women; now it is 47%: If the graph does not display please click here The difference can be seen in the breakdown of the age of those working. In 1974 the most likely age a woman would work was in their early 20s. Then the “nappy valley” would occur: women leaving the labour force, having kids and essentially never returning. Men on the other hand did not seriously leave the labour force until their early 60s: If the graph does not display please click here Now things are much more equitable (if not completely so). The current most likely age for women to work is their 40s and 50s and the nappy valley has become a flat land. Women don’t have the steady increase that men do in their late 20s and early 30s, but there is no longer the large exit from work: If the graph does not display please click here Another key change is that women are now more likely to work full-time than in the past. In 1974 just 30% of women in their late 20s worked full-time, now half do: If the graph does not display please click here Here we still see evidence of women leaving to have children – although it now occurs in their 30s rather than 20s and it is more likely to involve going from full-time to part-time. For men, however, the story is the quite different. Men are now less likely to work full-time than their counterparts 48 years ago – due to the shift towards more “flexible work arrangements”: If the graph does not display please click here But despite these movements, the gender gap of full-time work remains very much in force, with men in their 30s and 40s being almost twice more likely to work full-time than women at that age: If the graph does not display please click here And so the unemployment rate is likely to get below 4% sometime this year – it’s already at 4.2%. But it is worth reflecting that we got to that level due to very unusual circumstances, and that just looking at the rate itself hides a lot of what is going on in the labour market. We have a very different economy to what we had the last time the unemployment rate was under 4%, but what unites both now and 1974 is that a reduced labour force might provide a better looking unemployment rate, but not necessarily a better economy or community.",News/Business,Australia’s 4% unemployment in isolation hides what’s really going on in the labour market | Greg Jericho,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/feb/10/australias-4-unemployment-in-isolation-hides-whats-really-going-on-in-the-labour-market
