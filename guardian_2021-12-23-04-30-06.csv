The Imperial College outbreak modelling team led by Prof Neil Ferguson analysed hospitalisations and vaccine records among all PCR-confirmed Covid cases in England between 1 and 14 December.  In a report published on Wednesday, the scientists found that any attendance at hospital was a fifth to a quarter lower with Omicron versus Delta cases, and between 40% and 45% lower when the visit resulted in being admitted for at least one day.

12/23/2021,"The actor Jack Hedley, who has died of a heart attack aged 92, had a solemn face and military bearing that often made him appear dour on screen, but he was well cast in television roles that made his face more familiar than his name. In his early small-screen career, he even attained heart-throb status as the undercover agent and anti-hero of the title in The World of Tim Frazer (1960-61), screened under the Francis Durbridge Presents banner. He appeared in three overlapping six-part thriller serials as the easygoing structural engineer recruited by a secret government department.  The character conceived by Durbridge as “ordinary” – not “tough, trigger-happy or dame-slapping” – investigates his own business partner’s mysterious disappearance in England, drug smuggling in Amsterdam and the death of another undercover agent in Wales. “It’s refreshing to be given a part in which I can wear smart clothes, drive fast cars and have a mews house in London,” said Hedley at the time. “It certainly makes a change from the neurotics I’ve played in the past.” He later claimed to rue the fact that “this Frankenstein’s monster of an upper-crust Englishman was born”, but it served him well over the next few decades. Hedley’s services history in the Royal Marines informed his performance in Colditz (1972-74) as Lieutenant-Colonel John Preston, senior British officer at the Germans’ castle fortress whose escape-proof reputation is put to the test by allied prisoners of war. Preston is a strict, emotionless disciplinarian, but he is highly principled and respected by his fellow officers as he defends them – often using his encyclopedic knowledge of the Geneva conventions – while building up a relationship with the kommandant (played by Bernard Hepton). The stiff upper lip quivers only when he hears about his wife’s death. Later, Hedley played a former soldier in Who Pays the Ferryman? (1977), the widower Alan Haldane, who sells his boat business and returns to the Greek island of Crete, where he had once been a hero among resistance fighters. He hopes to see his wartime lover but discovers that she is dead – and that he had fathered a girl who is now a young woman. This Greek tragedy had real-life consequences for some of the cast and crew, including Hedley. Several blamed broken marriages on the four months they spent filming Who Pays the Ferryman? on Crete, and Hedley – who admitted to having affairs on filming trips abroad – said his own went downhill on his return home. “There is something strange and mysterious about these Greek islands,” he said. “When the cast arrived, they suddenly started acting strangely. They were no longer themselves. One man walked into the sea at midnight and said he was going to swim to Cyprus, 700 km away. Another man fell madly in love with a girl who did not return his feelings. As a result, he tried to take his own life.” Hedley married Jean Fraser in 1965, after meeting her in Ireland while filming The Very Edge (1963), in which he played a detective and she was the producer’s assistant. The couple divorced in 1984. The actor was born Jack Hawkins in London, and said he never knew his father. His mother, Dorothy Withill, had grown up in poverty but went on to make a fortune by founding Direct Mail, an office services business. Jack later took his cousin Hedley Hawkins’s forename as his own professional surname because the film star Jack Hawkins – another performer who attracted military roles on screen – was already registered with Equity, the actors’ union. On leaving Emanuel school in Battersea, south London, he became a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, then spent eight years as a marine commando on active service in Malaya, India, the East Indies, Australia and Korea. He rose from cadet to lieutenant but was eventually invalided out after being shot twice in the leg. He then worked in his mother’s business but, after 18 months, was losing interest in his job. On walking past Rada’s building on the way to the office one day, he decided to audition for an acting course and was accepted. While there, he played Dr Dolittle, opposite Glenda Jackson’s Eliza, in Pygmalion at St Pancras town hall. After graduating in 1957, he went straight into the West End as Daniels in It’s the Geography that Counts (St James’s theatre). Screen producers were quick to spot his talents and he made his film debut as Dr Galbraith in Behind the Mask (1958), following it with small parts as an architect in Room at the Top (1959) and a reporter in Lawrence of Arabia (1962). His military background came to the fore in movies such as The Longest Day (1962) and How I Won the War (1967). Films never fully exploited Hedley’s talents, although he had satisfying roles in Goodbye, Mr Chips (1969) as William Baxter, the housemaster who beats Peter O’Toole’s Chips to become headteacher, and the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only (1981), in which he not only played Sir Timothy Havelock, but also voiced the millionaire yacht owner’s parrot. Television gave him better opportunities. In the Alun Owen play No Trams to Lime Street (1959), he was cast as a merchant sailor on shore leave in Liverpool having an affair with Billie Whitelaw’s married woman. Then, he starred as the cockney seafaring wireless operator Corrigan Blake, caught up with revolutionaries in the Caribbean, in the 1962 pilot You Can’t Win ’em All, also written by Owen – but was replaced for the subsequent series, Corrigan Blake. Other TV roles included Donald Killearn (1970-71), a colleague of the agony aunt played by Phyllis Calvert, in Kate; Graham Jesson, husband of Sophia Loren’s tempted Anna, in the 1974 TV version of Brief Encounter; and the disappeared thriller writer Charles Latimer in A Quiet Conspiracy (1989). Hedley’s second marriage, to Elspeth (nee Daintry) in 1986, also ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, Alex (nee Westendarp), whom he married in 2001, and the two children of his first marriage, Jonathan and James.

12/23/2021,"A deputy headteacher and her partner have been jailed for child sexual abuse offences after they filmed themselves abusing and raping a girl. Julie Morris, a teacher who was also head of safeguarding at a primary school in Wigan, was sentenced to 13 years and four months in prison after she pleaded guilty to 18 child sexual abuse offences, including two counts of rape.  The 44-year-old teacher and her partner, David Morris, 52, filmed themselves abusing the girl, who was under 13, in a series of videos. Liverpool crown court heard the videos showed Julie Morris giggling as the abuse took place. On Wednesday she also admitted three counts of taking indecent images of a child, one of engaging in sexual communication with a child, and one of possessing indecent images of a child. Sentencing the couple, the judge, Andrew Menary, said: “Every now and again you see cases the circumstances of which are almost beyond belief. This is one of those cases. It demonstrates that human depravity really knows no depths.” David Morris was sentenced to 16 years for 34 offences, including seven counts of raping a child under 13, sexual activity with a child, engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, sexual communications with a child and taking, possessing and distributing indecent photographs of a child.The pair were also given indefinite sexual harm prevention orders and will sign the sex offender register for life. The offences are not related to Julie Morris’s employment at St George’s Central C of E primary school in Tyldesley, though police found that she had sent photographs of children at her school to David Morris. “These photographs were not indecent, or criminal in nature, and there is no evidence that any of the children were harmed,” said Merseyside police. John Wyn Williams, prosecuting, said the couple met on the dating app Plenty of Fish in 2016 after both had separated from their partners and the relationship “quickly became intensely sexual”. He said: “The communication between them became graphic and depraved, which led to some of their sexual fantasies becoming a reality.” David Morris was arrested on 2 September but cautioned and released and a number of devices were seized, which showed the recordings of rape and sexual abuse, the court heard. The couple were arrested the following day at an address in Hindley, Wigan. “The couple were found to be in possession of £10,000 in cash and their camper van was packed with their belongings, indicating that they were about to abscond,” said Merseyside police. Julie Morris was sacked shortly after her arrest. As well as videos and images on David Morris’s phone, officers trawled through 175,000 pages of messages between the couple, revealing sexually explicit communications. The pair also set up a group chat with the victim in which they would talk about how they would abuse her, the court heard.The police’s thorough analysis of 175,000 pages of chat logs, spanning three years, revealed the couple’s sexual interest in young children.DCI Bev Hyland said: “These extremely serious offences committed by Julie and David Morris have had a devastating impact on the victims and their families.” Thanking members of the public for their bravery in alerting police to the couple’s behaviour, Hyland added: “What makes this case even more concerning is the fact that Julie Morris held a position of trust as a teacher – she held the role of safeguarding lead – and yet she saw fit in her own personal life to completely disregard all of the responsibilities and the trust that her role held.”",News/UK news,Teacher and partner jailed after they filmed themselves abusing girl,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/22/teacher-and-partner-jailed-after-they-filmed-themselves-abusing-girl
12/23/2021,"It is not just the hospitality industry that is facing chaos in this moment of not-lockdown. The cultural sector, especially the performing arts, is similarly afflicted by the message that – quite rightly – extreme caution should be observed when it comes to attending crowded indoor events. What’s wholly unfair, though, is that the workers in the live arts – everyone from electricians to wigmakers, actors to folk musicians, front-of-house personnel to opera singers – are, once again, left flailing. On the one hand, shows are being cancelled because of illness and self-isolation as, especially in London, the Omicron variant of Covid-19 surges. (It is easier, at the present time, to count which West End shows remain open rather than those that have been forced into pre-Christmas closure.) On the other hand, bookings are plummeting. The scale of this is severe. Before the pandemic, the turnover of the arts and creative sector was £9.8bn – which nearly halved in 2020. Up to October 2021, the industries recorded revenues of just £4.7bn. There was a lot riding on the usually lucrative winter season. What this means on the ground is individuals having their work cancelled well into the new year: livelihoods are collapsing, again. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced a £30m top-up to the culture recovery fund. This is welcome, but it targets organisations in cashflow crisis, not individuals – and in the performing arts, 70% of the workforce are freelance. At the moment, there is no help for these people: the SEISS (self-employment income support scheme) was closed in September (and many cultural workers anyway found themselves ineligible under its frame of reference). The alternatives may be finding work outside the sector – or turning to universal credit.  At previous moments during this pandemic, Mr Sunak has engaged with workers’ representatives and the Trades Union Congress. There are no signs of such engagement at the present time. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has been all but silent, and it is highly improbable that she is regarded as a significant figure at the cabinet table. Lucy Powell, the recently appointed shadow culture secretary, is a more serious proposition, and she has been commendably swift to listen to those who work in the arts. Wales and Scotland have announced limits on gatherings after Christmas. This is intensely difficult for the performing arts, but at least allows for producers to plan. No such clarity exists in England. Post-Christmas restrictions are hinted at, but so far not confirmed. Clarity is a tough thing to wish for in the throes of a highly unpredictable pandemic. But if one thing has been predictable over the past 20 months, it has been precisely that: unpredictability. What is needed is a regularised means to carry workers through brief, acute phases of difficulty. Mr Sunak should be formulating a permanent short-time work scheme – something like the German Kurzarbeit, or the French scheme for les intermittents du spectacle (intermittent workers in the performing arts) – through which workers, including freelancers, may be supported through times of economic turbulence. The TUC published a sensible report into the idea in August. Such a programme would not just be beneficial to individuals, but would help businesses and organisations retain valuable workers. Talented, highly skilled people should not be facing the terror of the cliff edge every time a fresh variant of the virus threatens the route out of the pandemic.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Covid-hit arts: there is a solution | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/22/the-guardian-view-on-covid-hit-arts-there-is-a-solution
