5/2/2022,"My wife, Jennifer Piercey, who has died aged 79 from amyloidosis, was an actor who had a crowded career for more than 40 years on stage, television and radio. She worked with Alan Ayckbourn in the West End and Laurence Olivier at the National Theatre, toured the UK in rep and played Nicholas Lyndhurst’s mother in TV’s The Two of Us. Jennifer was born in Aberdeen, where her father, Leslie Thompson, was a civil engineer. Her mother, Elsie (nee Piercey), was a former fashion model. After St Margaret’s school, Aberdeen, Jennifer studied at the College of Speech and Drama in Edinburgh, graduating in 1963. She went straight into her first professional job, taking her mother’s maiden name as her stage name, playing a gorgon matron in Semi-Detached, by David Turner, at the tiny Byre theatre, St Andrews, the same year appearing as Prism in The Importance of Being Earnest. Moonlighting from the university as an assistant stage manager at the time, I fell hopelessly in love with her. We kept in touch sporadically then met again in London in 1975 and married in 1977. In the 1970s and 80s, British theatre still had a flourishing repertory network and Jennifer travelled and worked all over the UK. In 1972 Ayckbourn cast her as Eva, the foiled would-be suicide, in the original production of his Absurd Person Singular at the Library theatre, Scarborough. Subsequently in the West End she appeared in his Joking Apart and as the lovelorn secretary, Veronica, in The Revengers’ Comedies. Laurence Olivier invited her to join the National Theatre at the Old Vic in 1972, to appear in Macbeth, The Cherry Orchard and The Bacchae. She toured Australia in 1974 with the National Theatre company in The Front Page, written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, and in 1975 appeared as Denis Quilley’s wife in Zeffirelli’s West End production of Saturday, Sunday, Monday, by Eduardo De Filippo, adapted by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall. Other London work included a lovely study of the put-upon spinster Miss Walkinshaw in John Byrne’s The Slab Boys at the Royal Court and as a caustic secretary to Peter Bowles’s preening star in Noël Coward’s Present Laughter. Later appearances saw her as the redoubtable Lady Brocklehurst, forever pursuing her errant, randy husband (Ian Talbot), at the Open Air theatre in Regent’s Park in Talbot’s fizzing production of The Boy Friend. She also spent a key period in children’s theatre, which she loved, working for two seasons for the Unicorn Theatre Company in London. On television she appeared in Jonathan Creek (1998) and Grange Hill, and in several series of The Two of Us (1986-90). Among film work, a favourite was in Another Time, Another Place (1983), Michael Radford’s wartime Black Isle drama. Her last stage role came in 2005, in Men Should Weep, on tour for the Oxford Stage Company. Jennifer’s last few years were plagued by ill health but she enjoyed gardening, reading and cookery. She is survived by her sister, Patricia, three nephews and three nieces, and by me.",Arts/Stage,Jennifer Piercey obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/01/jennifer-piercey-obituary
5/2/2022,"Britain’s central bank policymakers are “duty bound” when they meet this week to push the UK into recession to cap rising inflation, a former Bank of England (BoE) official has said. Adam Posen, who runs Washington-based thinktank the Peterson Institute, said that while the Bank of England would not want workers to lose their jobs, it should hike interest rates now to squeeze out inflationary pressures made worse by Brexit trade and immigration restrictions. The BoE’s monetary policy committee (MPC) meets on Thursday and is expected to increase interest rates by 0.25%, taking the central bank’s base rate to 1% – its highest level since early 2009. Inflation in March peaked at 7% – its highest level for 30 years. Posen, who was a member of the MPC from 2009 to 2012, said the central bank needed to take more drastic action after Brexit reduced the UK’s labour supply and limited the flexibility of the workforce. Without a U-turn by the government on trade restrictions and immigration policy, the BoE must shrink the economy. “The central bank has no choice but to cause a recession when a broad range of prices are rising at such a strong pace,” he said. “It is duty bound to bring inflation down after more than a year when it has been more than 2 percentage points above its 2% target level during a period of full employment.” He said wages were increasing due to shortages of workers and this was likely to add to inflationary pressures over several years unless further interest rate hikes were imposed. He added that if wages failed to keep pace with inflation over the rest of the year, it showed that the wage bargaining power of workers was weak and there was even more reason to put the brakes on rising prices. “There is a greater risk of inflation persisting without further action in the UK compared with other major economies. The US is going through a period of high inflation that monetary policy will arrest. Euro area countries don’t really have much inflation other than the spike in energy and food prices caused by the Ukraine war. “The UK, on the other hand, has Brexit, which is going to restrict the supply of labour over the longer term, and trade restrictions that will keep prices higher than they would otherwise be,” he said. Opinion is divided among academics and City analysts over the next steps by the central bank, with some, including Posen’s predecessor on the MPC, the labour market economist Danny Blanchflower, arguing that rates need to remain low to protect an economy already heading for recession. Blanchflower, a professor at the Ivy League university Dartmouth College, said several recent indicators showed the UK was already heading into recession and it would be irresponsible for the BoE to give it an extra push. But those calling for a succession of interest rate increases this year argue the faster pace of wage increases and strong levels of savings among middle and higher income groups will mean demand outstrips supply, generating even higher inflation. They say firms lack the skilled workers and raw materials needed to meet demand, and are likely to respond by increasing prices further. Shortages of workers pushed vacancy rates to a fresh record in the latest labour market figures covering the three months to February. The worst affected industries – IT, manufacturing, construction and hospitality – were those that relied most on foreign-born workers, mostly from the EU, Posen said. He added the UK was “far more open to trade and immigration, and attractive for foreign investment before the 2016 Brexit vote”. Ken Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said: “A recession in Europe is almost inevitable if the war in Ukraine escalates, and the Chinese economy may already be in recession. Writing on the Project Syndicate website, he added: “And with US consumer prices currently increasing at their fastest rate in 40 years, prospects for a soft landing for prices without a big hit to growth look increasingly remote.” Last week the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Britain would postpone physical checks on fresh food imported from the EU for a fourth time, citing the likelihood they would cost UK firms £1bn in red tape. A report last week by researchers at the LSE Centre for Economic Performance said that the introduction of new post-Brexit trading rules last year caused a “major shock” to UK-EU trade. The research found UK imports from the EU fell by 25% relative to those from elsewhere in 2021. Its authors suggested new rules had also caused many smaller businesses to terminate relationships with suppliers based in the EU and stop exporting to the 27-member trading bloc.",News/Business,Bank of England ‘duty bound’ to trigger recession to curb inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/01/bank-of-england-duty-bound-to-trigger-recession-to-curb-inflation
5/2/2022,"Tens of thousands of people have taken part in French street demonstrations as Labour Day marches sent a “message” to Emmanuel Macron that he must consult citizens more during his second term, and reverse plans to raise the retirement age or face protests. “There will be a fight over pensions, that’s clear – battle has been declared,” said the leftwing CGT trade union in Toulouse. Trade unionists, environmentalists and parties on the left – as well as yellow-vest anti-government protesters – marched in cities across France, demanding a rise in pensions and salaries and an end to Macron’s plan to gradually raise the pension age to 65. There was a large police presence in Paris. France Télévisions reported that a few demonstrators dressed in black on the edge of the otherwise peaceful Paris march had smashed windows and a cash dispenser and police fired tear-gas. In the Brittany city of Rennes, police used tear-gas and water cannon to keep a group of anti-fascist demonstrators from the city centre. The centrist Macron, who was reelected last weekend with 58.5% of the vote against the far-right Marine Le Pen, is under pressure to govern differently in his second-term — with less top-down decision-making and a more participative, decentralised approach, in which citizens would have more input. “This is a very political May Day, where workers intend to weigh heavily on all the big issues,” said Benoît Teste, head of the FSU teachers’ union. “It’s a crucial moment to feel the mood on the ground and set the tone.” “I want to calm things,” Macron had told locals in a walkabout in south-west France on Friday, after vowing to take into account everyone who voted for him, including those on the left who chose him only to keep out Le Pen. But no details have filtered out on how Macron would consult with citizens or whether he will undertake a reform of France’s political system, including introducing an element of proportional representation in parliament. With his second term beginning officially on 14 May, Macron is currently deliberating over who to appoint as the new prime minister who will have expanded powers on overseeing French environmental policy. Some have hoped it would be a woman with a background on the left. Macron has spent recent days still in campaign-mode, wading into crowds in town squares in order to listen to voters’ concerns, sometimes for hours at a time, to counter his image as haughty and aloof and to show he has understood the current cost-of-living crisis, which is voters’ number one concern. This is seen as crucial if he is to secure a broad centrist majority in the parliamentary elections in June that would give him a free hand to implement his policies of overhauling the welfare state and pensions system. The parliament vote has been seized upon by both the far-right Le Pen and the radical-left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who are seeking to greatly increase their seats in a France where voters are divided and disappointed with politics. “What we have seen is an extremely strong break between the base of the social pyramid – those who don’t have riches nor power nor influence – and the so-called summit,” said François Bayrou, the head of the centrist party MoDem, and a key Macron ally, during the campaign. “There must be a new government approach, which must be constantly in consideration of the French people.” Sylvain Burquier was one of 150 people randomly selected to take part in a citizens’ assembly to develop methods for cutting carbon emissions during Macron’s first term. Environmentalists criticised the government for not going far enough to follow the citizens’ recommendations. But Burquier said the method itself, of forming an assembly of everyday people to thrash out difficult public policy issues, had proved that it worked and should be expanded. “The 150 of us are convinced that new forms of participative or deliberative democracy can move issues forward,” Burquier said. “By being a middle path – neither activists nor businesses – we shook things up … The population was behind us, we’re still active today, we upset a lot of people because we were totally transpartisan, and only linked by the common good, not at all by political posturing … It’s a new transversal way of doing things that upsets the status quo and when that happens, things move forward.” Macron has promised his second term would be devoted to tackling the climate emergency, after admitting environmental policy must be speeded up. But an Elabe poll after Macron’s presidential win on 24 April found 57% of people didn’t believe he would make the environment his top priority. A key policy task in the short term is to address the cost of living crisis. Macron is expected to renew caps on energy costs and consider further anti-inflation payments to low-income households this summer. Ultimately, Macron has promised to get France to full unemployment. The unemployment rate dropped to its lowest in 13 years during Macron’s first term, and its economy – the world’s seventh largest – outperformed other big European countries as well as the broader euro currency zone. But with inflation in France reaching a new high of 5.4% in April, while growth stalled in the first quarter, May Day marchers warned that people were angry at the struggle to make ends meet, calling for salaries to be increased and pensions to be raised. Trade unions at the demonstrations said Macron’s new plans to raise the retirement age could lead to strike action. During Macron’s first term, a different proposed pensions overhaul sparked protests that lasted longer than any strike since the wildcat workers’ stoppages of 1968, and the reform was shelved during the pandemic. “If there’s a need to, we’ll strike,” the secretary general of the Force Ouvrière trade union told BFMTV at the Paris demonstration. “Let that be heard. We have our reasons. It’s not just pure obstruction, it’s based on an economic and social argument.”",News/World news,May Day marches across France send pensions message to Macron,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/may-day-marches-across-france-send-pensions-message-to-macron
5/2/2022,"The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol will decide “in the next week or two” whether to issue subpoenas trying to force Republican lawmakers to testify about Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, one of two Republicans on the panel said on Sunday. “If that takes a subpoena, it takes a subpoena,” Adam Kinzinger said. The Illinois congressman also told CBS’s Face the Nation public hearings planned for June will aim to “lay the whole story out in front of the American people … because ultimately, they have to be the judge” of Trump’s attempt to hold on to power. Kinzinger and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol attack, which a bipartisan Senate committee linked to seven deaths. But Senate Republicans stayed loyal, acquitting Trump, and Kinzinger is one of four anti-Trump House Republicans who have since announced their retirements. He and Liz Cheney of Wyoming are the only Republicans on the January 6 committee. The June hearings, Kinzinger said, will involve laying out “what led to January 6, the lies after the election, fundraising, the 187 minutes the president basically sat in the Oval Office [as the Capitol was attacked] … the response by [the Department of Defense]. “It’s important for us to be able to put that in front of the American people because ultimately, they have to be the judge. The Department of Justice will make decisions based on information but the American people … have to take the work we’ve done and decide what they want to do with it or what they want to believe.” Majorities of Republicans in Congress and in public polls believe – or choose to support and repeat – Trump’s lie that Biden stole the presidency via electoral fraud. Prominent Trump supporters in Congress who have advanced that lie and were involved in attempts to overturn the election before 6 January have refused to speak to the House committee. “I won’t say who I think we need to talk to yet,” Kinzinger said. “I mean, I think everybody needs to come and talk to us. We’ve requested information from various members. “In terms of whether we move forward with a subpoena, it’s going to be both a strategic tactical decision and the question of whether or not we can do that and get the information in time. Decisions we make every day.” Kinzinger added, “I think ultimately, whatever we can do to get that information. I think if that takes a subpoena, it takes a subpoena. “But I think the key is, regardless of even what some members of Congress are going to tell us, we know a lot of information … we’re going deeper with richer and more detail to show the American people.” Kinzinger said he would “love to see” Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president who ultimately refused to reject electoral college results on 6 January, testify before the committee. “I hope he would do so voluntarily,” he said. “These are decisions I think that we’re going to end up making from a tactical perspective in the next week or two, because we basically pinned down what this hearing schedule is going to look like, the content. “And as we go into the full narrative of this thing. I would hope and think that the vice-president would want to come in and tell this story, because he did do the right thing on that day. If he doesn’t, we have to look at the options we have available to us if there’s information we don’t already have.” A lawyer for Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a far-right Republican congresswoman shown in court filings by the committee to have been in contact with the White House around 6 January, has claimed she was in fact a victim of the riot. “I’d love to ask her a few questions,” Kinzinger said. “We know some things. I won’t confirm or deny the text messages of course, but let me just say this. “For Marjorie Taylor Greene to say she’s a victim, it’s amazing … I mean, she assaulted I think a survivor … from a school shooting at some point in DC. She stood outside a congresswoman’s office and yelled through a mail slot and said [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] was too scared to come out and confront her. “And then when Marjorie Taylor Greene is confronted she’s all of a sudden a victim and a poor helpless congresswoman that’s just trying to do a job? That’s insane. “We want the information.”",News/US news,"January 6 committee set to subpoena Trump allies, Republican Kinzinger says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/january-6-committee-subpoena-trump-allies-republican-kinzinger
5/2/2022,"Gamechanger. There is no better way to describe Mino Raiola and his impact on the transfer market, a crazy and unpredictable world where he fitted perfectly. As a moment to sum up the agent – and what he built around him – nothing can beat what unfolded before my eyes in Turin on 17 July 2019. Matthijs de Ligt was expected to arrive at the Juventus Stadium, and hordes of enthusiastic fans had come to greet him. He was another world-class signing after Cristiano Ronaldo in 2018, with competition seen off from clubs such as Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. The man behind the deal was Raiola, whose excellent relations with Pavel Nedved, the Juventus vice-president and one of his former clients, had helped to smooth the deal from Ajax. When the car arrived and Raiola got out first, the Juventus fans started … singing for him. Incredible but true. It was surely the first time in football history, supporters chanted for an agent. “Mino, Mino, Mino …” The song was pretty clear and a laughing Raiola greeted the fans before answering the inevitable questions from journalists about his commissionIt was a snapshot of who Raiola was in the football industry: a smart man ready for anything who certainly would not have wanted to be “beatified” after his death aged 54 on Saturday. For fans and managers Raiola could be a dream and a nightmare. There were those who sang his name in the hope of a top player joining their club and those who hated him to the point of obsession because they were terrified of losing a star, or because of his financial demands.In July 2016 I saw Raiola in the centre of Milan with his cousin and right-hand man Vincenzo. A delicate and important negotiation was under way for Paul Pogba to return to Manchester United from Juventus. Raiola had arrived to meet Juventus in secret and as soon as he saw me he hid next to the entrance of the hotel where the meeting was scheduled to take place. Shortly after, he walked in with his usual sly smile. “No photos or videos now,” he told me. “We still need a little patience for a historic deal, OK?”Three weeks later, Raiola completed a deal for United to pay €100mfor a player they had lost on a free transfer four years earlier. It was a masterpiece for his strategy. Communication was his priority, dividing public opinion to win the trust of his clients. It is no coincidence that for many years some of the world’s best footballers chose him, knowing he was ready to go to war with clubs to defend their interests. The other keywas vision. For months, despite being seriously ill, Raiola had been preparing a strategy for Erling Haaland’s future. He considered Haaland one of the finest jewels of his time as an agent and was proud to have brought him to his agency when the forward was at RB Salzburg, before the world had noticed the Norwegian. Raiola made sure he fulfilled the promise he made to Haaland and the player’s father, Alfie: to bring the best possible offers from Europe’s top clubs, each with a similar salary, to allow the choice to be entirely in the striker’s hands. Raiola’s relationship with Pep Guardiola had been far from excellent since Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s time at Barcelona but he wanted Haaland to be able to freely choose his future by including Manchester City in the race. It is impossible to mention all the champions managed by Raiola but the one perhaps hit hardest by his death is Ibrahimovic. The Swede has been silent for days in the Milan dressing room and was among the few allowed to enter the hospital to say goodbye to Raiola with his family. I will always remember what Raiola said to me after he held a meeting with Milan’s board regarding Ibrahimovic’s return from LA Galaxy and I asked whether he was progressing with negotiations. “We always go forward with negotiations,” he replied. “With mine it’s impossible to go back. Then Ibrahimovic is able to do things that humans can’t even imagine.” The last line was delivered with a laugh. The essence of Raiola’s strategy was clear to everyone, and he was hated or loved depending on the opportunities he could bring to a club. He was surrounded by stars and demanded multimillion commissions so that anyone who wanted to negotiate with him knew they had to invest huge figures. Those who knew him well say his biggest regret was not having seen Mario Balotelli win the Ballon d’Or. Raiola often repeated to friends that “Mario could even get two or three, if only he wanted to ...”Raiola was a man of jokes, fierce attacks and regular clashes with public opinion and clubs but he also built excellent relationships in football and life and always had one goal: the best possible strategy for his clients and himself.

5/2/2022,"Russia’s online trolling operation is becoming increasingly decentralised and is gaining “incredible traction” on TikTok with misinformation aimed at sowing doubt over events in Ukraine, a US social media researcher has warned. Darren Linvill, professor at Clemson University, South Carolina, who has been studying the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA) troll farm operation since 2017, said it was succeeding in creating more authentic-seeming posts. He has identified the sharing of faked factchecking posts and accounts which amplify disinformation by linking between platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Telegram, as current tactics by the IRA which it now believes is operating across different locations. On Sunday, the UK government claimed it has identified a former factory in St Petersburg as a new base for trolling operations where “cyber soldiers are ruthlessly targeting politicians and audiences across a number of countries including the UK, South Africa and India”. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office cited government-funded research, which it has not published, that reportedly shows paid staff in Russia are “using Telegram to actively recruit and coordinate new supporters who then target the social media profiles of Kremlin critics – spamming them with pro-Putin and pro-war comments.” Linvill said this was “highly consistent with what we have seen the IRA previously do, given how it understands the power of authenticity”. It was reported that targets have included Boris Johnson’s social media accounts as well as accounts of bands and musicians including Daft Punk, David Guetta and Tiësto. The government said it had shared the research with the social media platforms. It said the Russian operation was searching for “organic content” posted by genuine users consistent with its messaging, and then working to amplify these messages. “This means that, provided the content they post is not too offensive, they are unlikely to be subject to de-platforming interventions,” an official said. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said: “We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with their lies about Putin’s illegal war. The UK government has alerted international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations.” Linvill said trolls using comments under legitimate accounts was a common disinformation tactic and was not new, adding: “The IRA has a long history of taking advantage of legitimate voices.” One benefit of a troll posting comments under an account with large numbers of followers is that they do not need many followers themselves to be seen. He said the IRA almost always posted in Russian and the main goal appeared to be influencing Russian public opinion, but the UK government said its latest research suggested Moscow’s operation was “designed to manipulate international public opinion” in favour of its military campaign in Ukraine. TikTok and Twitter have closed scores of accounts in recent months which Linvill believes may be linked to the IRA. He said the impact of TikTok was particularly startling, with some accounts having hundreds of thousands of followers. “They were very, very effective,” he said. “They got an incredible amount of traction in the nationalist Russian space.” Twitter said it proactively assesses for inauthentic behaviour and since the start of the war in Ukraine it has removed over 100,000 accounts for violations of its platform manipulation and spam policy. It has labelled or removed 50,000 pieces of content. TikTok and Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, have also been approached for comment. Linvill said the IRA’s strategy was not to cause people to believe something new, but rather to sow doubt and cause distrust in information sources that are usually seen as legitimate, in particular to deter domestic opposition to the Russian president. “If you don’t believe in anything, you’re not going to fight for anything and you are more likely to go along with Putin,” he said.",News/World news,Russia’s trolling on Ukraine gets ‘incredible traction’ on TikTok,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/russia-trolling-ukraine-traction-tiktok
5/2/2022,"A senior judge who prosecuted terrorists and is now in hiding in Afghanistan feels “heartbroken, abandoned and backstabbed” by the British government for refusing to bring him to safety despite a high court ruling in his favour. The high-profile judge, whom the Guardian is not naming for his safety, also received strong support from two former independent reviewers of terrorism legislation. He worked closely with British and American forces to prosecute Taliban, Isis, al-Qaida and Haqqani network terrorists captured in Afghanistan, and is at such high risk that he has to hide in separate locations from the rest of his family, who are also in hiding. He cannot have any direct phone conversations for fear of his location being revealed. A high court ruling on 1 April this year supported his claim for sanctuary in the UK. The UK government has accepted that he is at risk in Afghanistan but says he does not meet the policy criteria for being brought to the UK. Officials said his contribution to the UK’s counter-terrorism work in Afghanistan was “minimal” and that because the court where he prosecuted terrorists captured by the allies was an Afghan institution, he was not a direct employee of the British government. The judge faces having to make a highly dangerous journey to Pakistan to a UK visa-processing centre to get his biometrics done for a visa application. However, if the UK government then refuses the visa, he could be deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan and placed directly in the hands of the Taliban. The high court ruling from Mrs Justice Lieven states: “I do accept that if it did happen, it would place JZ [anonymised initials used in the ruling] and possibly his family at real and immediate risk of death.” She added that the UK government had failed to apply discretion to defer biometrics “in a rational manner”. The former independent reviewers of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile and Lord Anderson wrote to the Home Office on 15 April, urging them to reconsider their decision not to allow the judge to come to the UK. “The courageous acceptance by judges of the responsibility for incorruptible trial of terrorists … made an important contribution to the lives of Afghans and to international counter-terrorism efforts,” they said in their letter. In a second case where the government has left Afghans in danger in their home country, an Afghan interpreter who worked for British forces and was badly injured in a Taliban bombing before being relocated to the UK has been trying for eight months to bring his parents and brothers from Afghanistan to safety in Britain. However, a Ministry of Defence (MoD) letter dated 26 April stated that officials had not yet been able to confirm the eligibility of the man’s family for the Afghan relocations and assistance policy scheme and urged his supporters not to make the case public. The judge in hiding told the Guardian through an intermediary: “I am shocked by the government’s decision to refuse to relocate me in the UK. I was once considered an important ally, given security due to the imminent threat I faced and awarded certificates of appreciation for making material contribution to the UK and allies’ counter-terrorism mission in Afghanistan. “I do not regret serving justice upon those who killed innocent people including UK government personnel, but I am heartbroken, abandoned and feel backstabbed by the government for refusing to relocate me in the UK. I plead with them to save my life and the lives of my family.” An MoD spokesperson said officials were unable to comment on individual cases: “We recognise the challenging circumstances faced by Afghans applying to resettle in the UK through the Afghan relocation and assistance policy (Arap) scheme and are processing applications as quickly as possible. To date we have relocated over 9,000 applicants and their dependants to the UK. The scheme remains open and is not time limited, and we are determined to continue with this work.”",News/UK news,Judge in Afghanistan ‘backstabbed’ by UK government’s refusal of sanctuary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/judge-afghanistan-uk-government-high-court-ruling
5/2/2022,"Full marks to George Monbiot for his critique of the English school exam system (England’s punitive exam system is only good at one thing: preserving privilege, 27 April). He asks what would a fair, rounded 21st-century education look like. One answer would be to look at Finland, where there are no exams before school leaving and no league tables. All assessment is teacher-based, geared to guiding further learning. Teachers enjoy high professional autonomy, grounded in their own education to master’s level. The Finnish system is avowedly egalitarian, with the aim of minimising social inequalities. All students receive free school meals. And guess what? Finland outperforms the UK not only in terms of wellbeing and life satisfaction of 15-year-olds, but also in their performance in the OECD Pisa tests, based on reading, mathematics and science. The English education system is based on three Cs: competition, coercion and cramming. The Finnish system rests on three different Cs: collaboration, communication and conceptualisation. Finnish education is not perfect, and it is not the only route to high Pisa performance. But the OECD is in no doubt what a 21st-century education requires: “When teachers feel a sense of ownership over their classrooms, when students feel a sense of ownership over their learning, that is when learning for the ... information age can take place.” There is an alternative, if we so choose.Chris SinhaHonorary professor, University of East Anglia  Once again, George Monbiot has highlighted a major flaw in UK society and the role exams play in preserving privilege. It is, of course, possible to bypass the system, as my own experience has shown. Having left state school at age 17 without any A-levels, I then managed to re-enter higher education by gaining workplace qualifications to gain a BSc and PhD, and became a professor at the University of Nottingham. The challenge of regurgitating information in exams in no way helped me. But having a more rounded education provided me with a much more supportive attitude in teaching students, hopefully helping many to fully reach their potential, beyond the normal criteria of exam grades.Dr Michael SymondsSutton Bonington, Nottinghamshire  There are reasons other than those George Monbiot mentions that explain the government’s desire for introducing a Gradgrind education system. Reducing the curriculum to easily quantifiable elements makes it easy for the government to control education and to ensure educational deviancy is eliminated. Good schools are those that match up to criteria determined by the government. Margaret Thatcher’s distress at the wrong sort of people controlling our children’s education is no longer a problem. Curriculum and teaching methods are determined by ministers. Any school that doesn’t meet the imposed criteria will be deemed failing and closed. Educational deviancy, or more correctly, independent thinking, is eliminated from the system. This system also provides plenty of “red meat” to be thrown to the media. An arbitrary change in the rules makes it easy to find schools that are failing. There is nothing more likely to thrill the rightwing media than a tough minister cracking down on errant schools.Derrick JoadLeeds  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/2/2022,"Joe Biden’s $33bn request to Congress for more aid for Ukraine is likely to receive swift approval from lawmakers, a senior Republican said on Sunday, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, made a surprise visit to the war-riven country. The president on Thursday had asked for the money for military and humanitarian support for Ukraine as it fights to repulse the Russian invasion now in its third month. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and ranking member of the House foreign affairs committee, went on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulous and said he expected the chamber would look favorably on the request in the coming weeks. McCaul’s comments came while Pelosi led a congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the House speaker promised on behalf of the US: “We are here until victory is won.” McCaul was asked if he believed Congress would quickly pass Biden’s requested package, which includes $20bn in military aid, $8.5bn in economic aid to Kyiv and $3bn in humanitarian relief. “Yes, I do,” McCaul said. “Time is of the essence. The next two to three weeks are going to be very pivotal and very decisive in this war. And I don’t think we have a lot of time to waste. I wish we had [Biden’s request] a little bit sooner, but we have it now.” McCaul added that he believed Republicans, who have supported the Democratic president’s previous financial requests for Ukraine, might have acted more expediently if they held the House majority. The chamber is not sitting during the coming week while members tend to in-district affairs, delaying debate and a vote on the aid package. “If I were speaker for a day, I’d call Congress back into session, back into work,” he said. “Every day we don’t send them more weapons is a day where more people will be killed and a day where they could lose this war. I think they can win it. But we have to give them the tools to do it.” Meanwhile, Bob Menendez, the Democratic New Jersey senator who chairs the upper chamber’s foreign relations committee, echoed Pelosi’s pledge that the US would continue to support Ukraine financially. “We will do what it takes to see Ukraine win because it’s not just about Ukraine, it’s about the international order,” he said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “If Ukraine does not win, if [Russia’s president Vladimir] Putin can ultimately not only succeed in the Donbas but then be emboldened to go further, if he strikes a country under our treaty obligations with Nato, then we would be directly engaged. “So stopping Russia from getting to that point is of critical interest to us, as well as the world, so we don’t have to send our sons and daughters into battle. That ability not to have to send our sons and daughters into battle is priceless.” Menendez said that the US and its allies needed to “keep our eye on the ball” over a possible Russian move into Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria, where explosions were heard in recent days. “I think that the Ukrainians care about what’s going to happen in Transnistria, because it’s another attack point against Ukraine,” he said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. And that is about helping Ukraine and Ukrainians ultimately being able to defeat the butcher of Moscow. If we do that, the world will be safer. The international order will be preserved, and others who are looking at what is happening in Ukraine will have to think twice.” Samantha Power, administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), laid out the urgent need for Congress to approve the package during an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation. “There are vast swaths of Ukraine that have been newly liberated by Ukrainian forces, where there is desperate need, everything from demining to trauma kits to food assistance, since markets are not back up and running,” she said, noting that from previously approved drawdowns “assistance is flowing”. But she said that 40 million people could be pushed into poverty, and demands for help would only grow. “We’re already spending some of that money, but the burn rate is very, very high as prices spiral inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine,” Power said. “So that’s why this supplemental is so important. It entails $3bn of humanitarian assistance to meet those global needs, which are famine-level, acute malnutrition needs. “And it includes very significant direct budget support for the government of Ukraine, because we want to ensure the government can continue providing services for its people.” “Putin would like nothing more than the government of Ukraine to go bankrupt and not be able to cater to the needs of the people. We can’t let that happen.”",News/US news,Republican: Biden’s $33bn Ukraine aid request likely to get swift approval,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/biden-request-33bn-ukraine-aid-michael-mccaul-republican
5/2/2022,"I greatly enjoyed Sophie Elmhirst’s article on the last of the UK’s phone boxes (The long read, 28 April). In the late 1980s, I worked for British Telecom in east London and when a new boss of “public call offices” (as phone boxes were officially called) was appointed, I was asked to take him on a tour of some of his new property. I took him to the site of one that I knew was frequently vandalised. All that remained were a few metal stubs poking out of the ground. It at least gave the new guy a feel for the scale of his job. From what I remember, he didn’t last long.Steve TownsleyBridgend  Your article was a joyous trip down memory lane. In the mid-1980s, I was the press officer for the international division of British Telecom. Due to a lack of interest from the corporate centre, I found myself managing the 30 or so BT district press officers dotted around the UK on matters of red phone boxes. As part of that, in tandem with my BT colleague Dave Wenlock, I toured schools, Dave suitably dressed in his “Mr Payphone” costume, imparting to young children the importance to the community of a working, reliable payphone network, key in those pre-mobile phone days.

However, I was dismayed to read a somewhat uncalled for slur about the game of real tennis in the closing paragraph of her article on Twitter’s new owner (What better owner for Twitter than Elon Musk, master of the ill-advised tweet?, 26 April). What has real tennis ever done to Marina to cause such an unprovoked attack? Perhaps we should be told. It is certainly not my experience of 30 years’ involvement with real tennis at Cambridge, where the university club is (unusually) open to young and old from all sorts of backgrounds, including both members and non-members of the university.

5/2/2022,"Arsenal breezed their way past Aston Villa, scoring seven unanswered goals at Borehamwood to stay shoulder to shoulder with league leaders Chelsea. Emma Hayes’ team are ahead by a single point, and the onus remains on Arsenal to continue winning their games in the hopes that their rivals might drop points. Arsenal’s clearest tactic was to ensure Beth Mead, who had scored in each of her last four games, remained in Mayumi Pacheco’s line of sight on the right-wing. While the visitors’ back four were busying themselves with Mead Vivianne Miedema sprung up to cause defensive chaos from the left. The Dutchwoman evaded Sarah Mayling’s erratic marking from the start, making darting runs in the box, and at other times, delivering defence-dissecting passes. It was this particular pattern of play that led to Arsenal’s – and Miedema’s – first. With an audacious run through the Villa midfield, the forward blasted the ball past Sian Rogers as early as the ninth minute of the game. Of course, one would not be enough, especially with the WSL Golden Boot race hotting up. Arsenal searched for a second through Miedema, this time troubling the Villa central defensive pairing. Anita Asante and Rachel Corsie struggled to remain in touch with one another. It wasn’t long before Arsenal exploited their failings and struck a second time in the 13th minute, with Miedema perfectly recreating her first goal. It became increasingly apparent with both goals that Villa were missing Jill Scott’s tenacity and press. The 34-year-old’s injury left a gaping hole in defensive midfield, and Arsenal glided through it on almost every occasion, unchecked. It was only down to another outstanding performance from Rogers in goal, similar to her player of the match display against Manchester United, that kept the scoreline at 2-0. That would all change after half-time. Though Rogers had already made several saves in the first half, she could do little to divert a header from her own defender, Corsie, that gifted Arsenal a third goal in the 52nd minute. There had been some confusion on the scorer; Miedema’s shot clattered off the crossbar to meet Corsie’s head, Mead too seemed to be hovering around the goal, but it was the Villa defender that was deemed to have the final touch. Carla Ward had seen enough from her side, and indeed Alisha Lehmann, swapping her for Shania Hayles. But the forward joined nine other players camped deep in their own half, and soon there would be a fourth goal from Beth Mead, a fifth from Lotte Wubben-Moy, and a sixth from Stina Blackstenius in the 82nd minute, as Arsenal relentlessly ploughed through their opposition. At the cusp of full-time, Nikita Parris scored the seventh goal of the game from the penalty spot, and with the final whistle, both teams had gained their own reprieve and insight. Aston Villa will likely avoid relegation despite the battering, Arsenal know that they must continue to win their games and hope that Chelsea stutter against Birmingham City later on Sunday. All focus now turns to a big north London derby next weekend at the Emirates Stadium.",Sport/Football,Miedema sparks rout of Aston Villa as Arsenal maintain WSL title pursuit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/arsenal-maintain-wsl-title-pursuit-with-rout-of-aston-villa
5/2/2022,"It was all too much for the Everton legend Colin Harvey, who could not bear any more Chelsea pressure and made for the exit with a few minutes to go. Frank Lampard’s team could withstand it, however, and kept Everton’s Premier League survival prospects in their own hands with a potentially priceless victory over Thomas Tuchel’s team. Richarlison’s 46th-minute goal brought Everton a fourth successive Premier League win over Chelsea at Goodison Park in what was a must-win fixture given Burnley’s stirring revival under Mike Jackson. Jordan Pickford was immense in the Everton goal, repelling everything that Chelsea threw at him in the second half, while Yerry Mina was commanding in the heart of a defence that embodied resistance. Lampard’s new club live to fight another day. Evertonians did whatever they could to lift their team before the game. Chelsea players were disturbed in the early hours of Sunday morning by a long and loud fireworks display outside their hotel in Liverpool city centre. When the Everton team bus turned on to Goodison Road 90 minutes before kick-off it was met by thousands of fans who had congregated with banners and blue flares to welcome Lampard’s players. The question was how those with the greatest influence on Everton’s Premier League status would respond? As they had to, was the answer. Goodison was a beautiful bear-pit, imploring its team on while responding to any Chelsea touch or adverse decision with a chorus of boos. There were plenty of the former. Lampard set up his team to match Thomas Tuchel’s 3-4-3 formation but in the knowledge that the visitors, like Liverpool at Anfield last Sunday, would dominate possession. Chelsea enjoyed a 75% share in the first half. Jorginho and Ruben Loftus-Cheek regularly passed through midfield with ease and yet, for all the space and promising positions that Mason Mount found, Jordan Pickford was rarely employed in the Everton goal throughout the first half. Mount curled over from 20 yards and Timo Werner was denied by a fine recovery challenge from Séamus Coleman after Loftus-Cheek had broken through Everton’s lines but the Chelsea threat was otherwise limited. Kai Havertz spent most of the opening 45 minutes engaged in an off-the-ball spat with Yerry Mina. Distractions served Everton’s purpose as Chelsea began to lose composure. Anthony Gordon fed off the crowd to tear at the visitors from the first whistle. Brought down in a dangerous area by Loftus-Cheek the 21-year-old took the resulting free-kick himself but, after blazing over, Everton did not seriously threaten again until the breakthrough. The intent was there from Gordon, Richarlison and Demarai Gray but not the support of defensive-minded teammates to unsettle Thiago Silva or Antonio Rüdiger. Something had to give for Everton to claim the goal they desperately needed. It arrived in the form of a gift from César Azpilicueta rather than a change of approach from Lampard. Everton’s moment stemmed from a throw-in by Alex Iwobi a minute after the restart. Richarlison won it under pressure from Rüdiger only for Chelsea to recover possession through Silva. The veteran squared to his captain who, seemingly unaware of Richarlison’s tireless running, took too long over a clearance and smacked the ball into the Brazilian. Suddenly Everton were two-on-one on the edge of Chelsea’s penalty area. Gray touched the rebound back to Richarlison and, just onside, he slipped a measured shot beyond Édouard Mendy into the far corner. Goodison was in uproar and should have been celebrating the luxury of a second goal minutes later. The opportunity again came from an Iwobi throw on the right. Gordon spun away from his marker and found Abdoulaye Doucouré breaking into the Chelsea area. The midfielder released Vitalii Mykolenko on the left and the first goal of the Ukraine international’s Everton career beckoned. He opted for power over placement and fired badly wide. A Chelsea response was inevitable and Pickford performed heroics to keep them at bay when it came. With a slice of luck too. The England goalkeeper was beaten by his international colleague Mount when the No 10 struck the inside of one post and then the other with a half-volley from Havertz’s knock-down. The rebound fell invitingly for Azpilicueta but Pickford, having leapt up and sprinted across the goalmouth, managed to save the defender’s shot on the line. Mina hacked clear and, from the resulting corner, the ball dropped to the feet of Rüdiger at the back post. Pickford saved bravely at point-blank range, injuring himself in the process. He also tipped over from Loftus-Cheek’s 25-yard drive and denied the substitute Mateo Kovacic with a low save during seven minutes of stoppage time that turned Goodison apoplectic when it was announced. Gray could have soothed Everton nerves with five minutes remaining when breaking into the area following good work by Doucouré and the substitute Salomón Rondón but shot just over. But Everton held out, and fight on.",Sport/Football,Richarlison boosts Everton’s survival hopes with winner against Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
5/2/2022,"When a string of mysterious explosions hit government buildings in Transnistria, the Moscow-backed separatist region of Moldova, there was no immediate claim of responsibility. But for Pasha, a 24-year old journalist from the breakaway region’s capital, Tiraspol, this week’s blasts were a clear sign that it was time to get out. “There was a chance that there would be more attacks, and it’s no fun waiting to find out where would be hit next,” he said. Adding to the uncertainty were growing rumours that men in the region would be mobilised to fight alongside Russian troops across the border in Ukraine. So Pasha, his mother and his friend, fellow journalist Maxim, 23, packed their essentials and drove to the Moldovan capital, Chișinău, where they are staying with relatives. They are hoping to return home, but other friends who left Transnistria have already fled to Turkey, Poland or the Czech Republic. With a population of 470,000 people, Transnistria is a predominantly Russian-speaking sliver of land wedged between the Nistru River and the Ukraine border. A year after Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union, the region broke away in 1992 after a five-month war in which Russian forces (and Crimean Cossacks) intervened on the side of the separatists. No country, not even Russia, has recognised the self-declared Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, but the “frozen conflict” has kept Moldova partitioned ever since. Now, many fear that last week’s explosions may herald a dangerous thaw. On Monday, government buildings in Tiraspol were hit by what appeared to be rocket-propelled grenades. In the following days, blasts hit a radio tower broadcasting in Russian, and shots were reportedly fired near a Russian arms depot. Separatist authorities in Tiraspol blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators. Kyiv has accused Russia of launching the attacks to further destabilise the region, while Moscow denounced them as “acts of terror”. Meanwhile, Moldova’s pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, blamed the blasts on infighting between rival factions in Transnistria. But the uncertainty has prompted growing concern that Moldova could be dragged into the Ukraine conflict. Moscow has long used Transnistria as a bargaining chip in its efforts to influence Moldova. The region still hosts 1,500 Russian troops, as well as 20,000 tonnes of ammunition stored in Cobasna, the largest ammunition depot in eastern Europe. Among last week’s incidents were shootings a mile away from Cobasna, according to the Transnistrian authorities. Moldovan government sources fear that if the depot blew up it could result in an explosion 10 times bigger than the 2020 Beirut blast, where 2,000 tonnes of ammunition were stored. Despite its frail economy, Moldova has already received about 95,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine, a figure equivalent to 3.5% of its population, according to the Moldovan foreign ministry. The events of the past week are prompting many refugees to consider fleeing once again. “If war comes to Transnistria, I will leave, probably for Germany,” said Lyuda, 35, an accountant and single mother who fled Mariupol in March and is now working for the UNHCR mission in Moldova. Security has been stepped up on the Transnistrian side of the border, causing long queues of traffic, but at the Moldovan checkpoints down the road, security forces simply wave vehicles through. Moldova’s government has pledged to step up security, but for now life goes on as usual in Chișinău. In Valea Morilor park, joggers make laps around the lake, anglers cast their lines and the loudest sound is the voice of a canoe coach training her students. Across the city, Chișinău’s central market is packed with people buying food and offerings for the upcoming Paștele Blajinilor, Moldova’s holiday commemorating the dead. But even here, there is an edge of uncertainty. Alex, a stallholder in the market had just come off a call with a cousin in Italy who he was thinking of joining, he said. “I have a wife and a baby, and I don’t feel safe here,” he said. Inside Transnistria, separatist authorities have kept quiet about the war raging in Ukraine. “Transnistria’s leaders are being cautious,” said the Moldovan journalist Alina Radu. “They are not cheering on the war, but nor are they criticising Russia’s military aggression.” Since the death of its Soviet-era industry, Transnistria’s economy has been dominated by a small elite. Russia provides Transnistria with free gas, which gives businesses in the region a competitive advantage over Moldovan businesses. Its largest conglomerate, which controls everything from petrol stations to a cognac distillery – and the football club FC Sheriff – was co-founded by the former KGB agent Victor Gușan, who also has a Ukrainian passport and owns property in Kyiv. “Transnistrian leaders are under a lot of pressure,” said the Moldovan journalist Alina Radu. “For the first time, they are isolated. Both Moldova and Ukraine have governments that are not pro-Russian. Transnistrian elites have two options: to follow the orders of Putin, the most terrible dictator today, or to have a prosperous future with Europe.” Analysts in Chișinău warn that Russian security and propaganda networks are spreading. A recent report from the Royal United Services Institute, said Russian spy agency the FSB aimed “to destabilise Moldova to tie down Ukrainian forces on the southern border, to counter growing pro-European sentiment in the country, and to show the west that support for Ukraine risks wider consequences, including in the Balkans”. Valeriu Pașa, from the Moldovan thinktank Watchdog said that Moscow had overestimated vestigial pro-Moscow sentiment in the country. “Russia’s aim is to create tension,” he said, pointing to debunked viral reports that Romanian troops had been deployed near the border with Moldova. But Moldova, with a population of just 2.5 million, has already suffered from mass emigration, and such pressures still had the potential to cause more harm, said Radu. “I am afraid that the tension might generate yet another harmful wave of emigration – just as the government has been trying to bring back the diaspora.”",News/World news,‘I don’t feel safe here’: Transnistria fears could spark Moldova exodus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/i-dont-feel-safe-here-transnistria-fears-could-spark-moldova-exodus
