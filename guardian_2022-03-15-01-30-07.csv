3/15/2022,"War is a good time to bury scruples. We may hate Vladimir Putin, but one dictator at a time appears all we can handle. So Britain’s Boris Johnson is to make a humiliating dash to plead with Saudi Arabia’s ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to lower the price of oil. What will he offer in return? Will it be a blind eye to the state murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the continued devastation of the Yemenis, or the execution at the weekend of 81 men, some of them political prisoners? Who next is to be appeased, the “oligarchs” of the UAE, or Nicolás Maduro, ruler of oil-rich Venezuela? How kind must Britain suddenly be to China, as the latter equivocates in its attitude to Putin and greedily eyes Taiwan? Ukraine has brought an enhanced moral sloppiness to British policymaking. Sanctions were thought a price worth paying in lieu of coming more directly to Kyiv’s aid against Putin. But as the war has not gone well for Putin, nor have sanctions for the west. They have sent energy prices and inflation soaring. At first this was to be a noble display of sharing Ukraine’s agony, sort of. Now it has all got too much. Political scientists may call it realpolitik, but in truth it is merely starting to hurt. Oil-producing dictators are not fools. They know it would help sanctions if they raise production to lower energy prices. Some climate activists might think a price spike is no bad thing, given the need to limit global carbon fuel consumption. But either way, the spike will not last. The Ukraine war will end and prices will fall, as they have so often before. There is no reason to grant the oil producers their brief opportunity to launder their reputations in western capitals. Johnson now proposes to walk into the Saudi trap, to appease one, if not more, dictators to ease the pain of ever tougher sanctions. Every area of his domestic and foreign policy seems open to short-term expediency. He reportedly intends to reopen the prospect of hopelessly expensive nuclear plants and carpet the countryside with wind turbines. He is under pressure to cut fuel duty and drill for oil in the North Sea. There is talk of keeping coalmines open. Russia supplies just 8% of Britain’s oil and 4% of its gas, yet this is constantly called “dependence”. Industry minister Kwasi Kwateng pleads, “We are all vulnerable to Putin”. No we are not, just vulnerable to cunning lobbyists who race to exploit every area of policy weakness. The government’s anti-immigrant border policy is also being revealed in all its political crudity. Afghan immigrants are interned in London hotels and forbidden to work. Ukrainian migrants, after weeks of resistance, are welcomed into Britain’s homes, welfare state and labour market. The difference lies in the headlines. On Ukraine, British ministers are being bludgeoned across Europe for their inhumanity – and forced to concede an ethical policy. The Afghans are mere victims of Britain’s own military failure and can be forgotten. When foreign policy has to rely, as it often does, on equivocation, there is the more reason to hold tight to some underlying moral principles. Britain has been right not to join a war between foreign states that does not threaten its security. But that is precisely why it should stand up for concepts of freedom, charity and the rule of law, even at some short-term cost to itself. In other words it should see this crisis out. Saudi Arabia is an appalling regime. If Britain regards sanctions as the proper response to Putin’s war, it should bear the cost of that response. To oppose one dictator should not require appeasing another.

3/15/2022,"British judges have ruled that Bermuda’s ban on same-sex marriage is permitted under its constitution, in a setback for gay rights in the British overseas territory. The UK’s judicial committee of the privy council (JCPC) – the ultimate court of appeal for Bermuda and dozens of other British overseas territories, dependencies and Commonwealth states – on Monday overturned a decision by Bermuda’s highest court, which ruled the ban to be unconstitutional. The JCPC also ruled separately that there was no right to same-sex marriage under the constitution of the Cayman Islands. The attorney general of Bermuda appealed to the JCPC after the country’s court of appeal and supreme court both held that section 53 of the island’s Domestic Partnership Act (DPA) 2018, which confines marriage to a union between a man and a woman, was invalid. The case attempting to establish the right to gay marriage had been brought by six people including Roderick Ferguson, a gay Bermudian; Maryellen Jackson, a lesbian Bermudian and the LGBTQ charity OUTBermuda. The judges sitting in London allowed the attorney general’s appeal by a four-to-one majority. In the written judgment by Lord Hodge and Lady Ardent, they said: “No restriction is placed on the worship, teaching, practice and observance of the respondents which manifests their belief in the validity of same-sex marriage. The protection of a ‘practice’ does not extend to a requirement that the state give legal recognition to a marriage celebrated in accordance with that practice.” They also said that the exclusion of same-sex couples from the institution of marriage was not attributable – as the respondents had argued – to their creed but because they were of the same sex. Responding to the decision, Ferguson said: “The Bermuda government’s crusade against same-sex marriage was waged to convince you that there’s something shameful about your sexuality. “Don’t believe that tired old lie … Our work as a society is not done until everyone’s humanity is recognised both in law and in life.” In his dissenting judgment, Lord Sales said the attorney general’s arguments failed to take seriously the text of the constitution as a legal instrument “which contains a general protection for freedom of conscience and the right to manifest one’s conscientious beliefs by living in accordance with those beliefs (subject to a power on the part of the state to interfere with that right where that is justified for social reasons, which justification is absent in this case)”. OUTBermuda said future generations and future courts would be inspired by the dissenting judgment. But the charity also raised concerns about people who had already entered into gay marriages in Bermuda, including when the DPA was suspended. The case in the Cayman Islands concerned Chantelle Day and Vickie Bodden Bush, a lesbian couple who were denied a marriage licence in 2018 on the basis that marriage was defined in the territory’s bill of rights as “the union between a man and a woman as husband and wife”. They won an initial legal challenge but lost at the court of appeal and took the case to the JCPC. The same five judges as heard the Bermuda case unanimously rejected the appeal. In the written judgement, Sales said there was nothing in the constitution to stop legislation permitting same-sex marriage but the bill of rights had been “obviously” written “to emphasise the limited ambit of the right [to marry] and to ensure that it could not be read as capable of covering same-sex marriage”.",News/World news,"Bermuda’s ban on same-sex marriage is allowed, UK judges rule",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/bermuda-ban-on-same-sex-marriage-is-allowed-uk-judges-rule
3/15/2022,"Ed Sheeran “belittled” a songwriter who accused him of ripping off his song in the 2017 hit Shape of You, the high court has heard. Sami Chokri said he was hurt by the tone of Sheeran’s lawyers’ emails after he noticed similarities between his song Oh Why and Sheeran’s Shape of You. “I feel like I’ve been robbed by someone I respect, or respected,” he told the court. “This is years of a cloud over my head. All I heard and read was emails belittling me and my questions … All I wanted to do was ask for an explanation. If I’d had one, we wouldn’t have had to go through with this rubbish.” The grime artist called the trial “the most horrible weeks of my life”. Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch, claims Shape of You infringes “particular lines and phrases” of his track, which was released in 2015. He and his co-writer Ross O’Donoghue argue that a central “Oh I” hook in Sheeran‘s song is “strikingly similar” to an “Oh why” refrain in their own composition. Sheeran and his co-authors, the producer Steven McCutcheon and Snow Patrol’s John McDaid, deny allegations of copying and say they do not remember hearing Oh Why before the legal fight. In his written evidence, Chokri said he was shocked when he first heard Shape of You on the radio in 2017. “I was a passenger in my girlfriend’s car and Shape of You came on the radio,” he wrote. “She and I were both shocked to hear the similarities … She pulled over the car and we said this is what everyone is talking about.” He later posted on Facebook: “Anyone else think Ed Sheeran’s new song Shape of You chorus sounds familiar lol?” “I had lots of responses,” he said, including one from Sheeran’s friend Jamal Edwards, the late SBTV founder, who posted the “shifty eyes” emoji (which was later deleted). “I thought maybe he had played a part in showing [my song] to Ed,” Chokri said. Before his death last month, Edwards gave a written statement denying playing Oh Why to Sheeran. “Even if I was sent a copy, I did not share it with Ed,” he wrote. Chokri told the court that while he respected what Edwards had said, “I also believe that Jamal would share music with Ed Sheeran.” He said he believed Sheeran had heard Oh Why “through the many points of access that me and my team have shared” and “the closeness in our circles musically”. Last week Sheeran told the court that the contested element of his song was “entirely commonplace”. He added: “Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it. “I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly.” But Chokri told the court on Monday he did not accept Sheeran’s explanation. “I’m not sure if he lied or doesn’t remember,” he said. The songwriter, from Reading, said Oh Why was written in June 2014 during “a difficult period of time”. The court heard how he registered the song with PRS for Music – the industry body that collects and distributes royalties – only in 2017. Ian Mill QC, representing the Shape of You co-writers, suggested that “the reason you registered then was because you had in mind the claim about copyright infringement”. The court has previously heard that PRS for Music has suspended certain payments to Sheeran and his co-writers for the performances or broadcasts of Shape of You. Chokri said he knew about the suspension but “didn’t know that signing up to PRS was for that purpose”. Sheeran and his co-authors launched legal proceedings in May 2018, asking the high court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O’Donoghue’s copyright. The pair issued a counter-claim for copyright infringement, claiming that Shape of You infringed “particular lines and phrases” of their song.

3/15/2022,"An auction of signed books, experiences and mentoring sessions from the British literary community to raise money for Ukraine has raised £37,000 in its first week. Lots include lunch at the Ritz with Pillars of the Earth author Ken Follett, the chance to name characters in new books coming from crime writer Peter James and comedian Lenny Henry, a signed, limited edition of Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl’s memoir, and a 1945 first edition of Nancy Mitford’s novel The Pursuit of Love. Douglas Stuart is offering two tickets to the launch event in April for his new novel, Young Mungo, along with a signed, dedicated first edition of the novel, his hotly anticipated follow-up to his 2020 Booker prize-winning debut, Shuggie Bain. With almost 350 lots, the Book Aid For Ukraine auction still has a week to go and expects to raise tens of thousands more for refugees fleeing the Russian invasion. Literary agents are offering the chance for hopeful authors to get their manuscripts read, authors such as Erin Kelly, Charlotte Levin and Sarah Hilary are giving mentoring sessions, and there is a lunch date and signed book on offer from the BBC’s Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen. The auction was organised by Hayley Steed, a literary agent at the Madeleine Milburn agency, who was inspired by the auction organised by publisher Phoebe Morgan last year to raise funds to send Covid vaccines to India. Steed said: “I was watching the news about Ukraine and feeling powerless, and wondering what we could do as a books industry and community. Phoebe’s auction was hugely successful and I thought we might be able to do something similar for Ukraine. “So many people are feeling the same way and it seemed like this was the perfect chance to direct that energy into doing something positive.” She put out a call on social media and was astonished by the response, receiving more than 200 emails overnight offering lots for the auction. Publishing house Pan Macmillan has also said it will match all bids made on lots involving its authors. Steed said: “It’s going so incredibly well, far better than I expected. When we started I hoped that we might raise a five-figure sum but it’s far exceeded my expectations. It would be fabulous to get to £50,000 now, or even more.” Among the most hotly contested lots currently are a written critique of the first 25 pages of a novel from literary agent Juliet Mushens, (current bid £540), 10 signed copies of the latest Viz comic annual, , and a signed book and 45-minute tarot reading from astrologer Jessica Adams, for which bidding has passed £2,000. Money raised will go to British-Ukrainian Aid, which “offers assistance to vulnerable individuals who have been physically, mentally or socially disadvantaged, including the injured and wounded, orphaned children, elderly people, internally displaced persons, refugees and families who have lost their main earners”.

3/15/2022,"Bus fares in Greater Manchester will cost no more than £2 a journey after Andy Burnham won a fight with the private bus companies, enabling him to “put people before profit”. At least 30 bus operators compete for business in Greater Manchester, with single fares often costing £4 or more currently. Burnham, who won a second term as the region’s mayor last year, has promised to deliver a low-carbon, “London-style”, fully-integrated public transport system across bus, tram, train and bike, called the Bee Network. “The era of people paying £4 or more for a single journey is coming to an end,” said Burnham at the launch of the Greater Manchester 2021-31 “good lives for all” strategy. Children’s single fares would be capped at £1, he added. Greater Manchester is the first city region outside London to have brought buses back into public control in more than 30 years. Burnham’s colleagues Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire and Steve Rotheram in the Liverpool city region are hoping to follow suit. Wigan and Bolton will be the first of Greater Manchester’s boroughs to have Bee Network-branded buses from autumn 2023, with all 10 districts joining the network by the end of 2024. Burnham set out the new franchising timeline after bus companies failed in a judicial review to stop him bringing buses back under public control. “We will make travelling by public transport more appealing, easier and, significantly, put people before profits,” he said. The plans are supported by a £1.2bn five-year investment programme, with more than £430m to improve bus services across the city region. Burnham has hired the former managing director of Transport for London (TfL), Vernon Everitt, as his new transport commissioner. Dame Sarah Storey, Britain’s most successful paralympian, takes over from former Olympian Chris Boardman as Greater Manchester’s active travel commissioner. She has done the same job for the Sheffield city region for the past few years, and Boardman is now running Active Travel England. Storey, who went to school in Marple in Stockport and trained at the Manchester velodrome, said she was delighted to “come home”. “It’s not just about transport. It’s also about health. I live and breathe the benefits of walking and cycling every day so I will be making that case to government,” said Storey. “If you want to invest in the north, if you want to level up the north, you have to invest in people’s health and wellbeing.” She wants people to walk or cycle the first mile to the bus, tram or train stop “or even their whole journey if they are training for something crazy like me”.",News/UK news,Andy Burnham to cap Greater Manchester bus fares at £2 a journey,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/andy-burnham-cap-greater-manchester-bus-fares-2-pounds
3/15/2022,"Conservatives are blaming a “handful of very wealthy peers” who make up the shooting and hunting lobby over the news that legislation banning the import of hunting trophies is to be scrapped. The animals abroad bill contained measures including banning adverts for holidays that include elephant rides. It was to be a flagship bill signalling to the world that post-Brexit Britain was a world leader in animal rights, legislating against animal cruelty abroad. Most significantly, it included a commitment to ban the import of endangered animal parts. But over the weekend it emerged that the bill was no longer likely to be implemented. Government sources said it had been scrapped, and that manifesto commitments including the trophy hunting import ban would no longer take place in this parliament. The government has officially blamed a lack of parliamentary time to implement the bill, elements of which were promised in the 2019 Conservative manifesto. Ministers have blamed lobbying from the traditional wing of the party for No 10’s change of heart over the bill. A senior government source said: “A handful of crusties have managed to seize control. A handful of very wealthy peers are pressing for all the animal welfare measures to be dropped because they fear eventually it might mean their weekends could be affected.” Some within the Conservative party believe, according to this source, that trophy-hunting animal rights activists will say that it is hypocritical to legislate based on nature-depleting action abroad, when shooting weekends are still allowed in the UK. Conservative MPs have called on Boris Johnson to keep the bill alive and implement it as soon as possible. Sir Roger Gale, a member of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which counts the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, as a patron, spoke out on Monday. He said: “There is absolutely no place for trophy hunting in the civilised modern world. There is an infinitely better living for those in developing countries to be made out of photo tourism, the photographing of living wild animals, then there ever has been in murdering those animals simply to bring their body parts home and stick them on a wall. That is why trophy hunting has to be banned, and it has to be banned now”. Lord Benyon, an environment minister, has said it will be “debated when parliamentary time allows”. New polling from Survation, commissioned by the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, has found that 92% of Conservative supporters are in favour of a ban on imports of endangered animal hunting trophies. Eduardo Goncalves, of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: “Dropping a bill backed by 92% of your party’s supporters is baffling, to say the least. Aside from it being a broken manifesto commitment, it doesn’t look good when the prime minister and the Queen tell MPs the ban is going ahead, only to mysteriously axe it for no good reason. “One can only hope this is some terrible misunderstanding and that Boris Johnson will move quickly to clarify matters. If, as is expected, there is a new Queen’s speech in May, then it is imperative that the trophy ban is included within it. The patience of many Tory voters is fraying. Animal welfare issues can be strong drivers of voting intention. If the Conservatives go back on this commitment, they can expect it to come back to haunt them.” Those in the shooting lobby have welcomed the news that the bill has been delayed. Christopher Graffius, executive director of communications and public affairs at the British Association of Shooting and Conservation, said: “There is much good in the animals abroad bill that everyone who cares for animals and the countryside will support, but there are areas of the bill such as banning the importation of trophies from sustainable and regulated hunting which are not evidence based and will damage conservation. “With limited parliamentary time produced by a heavy legislative agenda and war in Ukraine, the withdrawal of the Bill allows for further consideration and improvement before its resubmitted to parliament.”",News/World news,Tory row as law barring import of hunting trophies set to be axed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/proposed-law-banning-import-of-hunting-trophies-to-be-scrapped
3/15/2022,"“What if the Titanic never hit an iceberg? What if it sank for another reason?” asks a bereaved character whose fiance perished on the “unsinkable” luxury liner in 1912. The what ifs in Ron Hutchinson’s drama explore the psychological effects of fake news spawned in the wake of the disaster, specifically the theory that the American financier JP Morgan orchestrated the sinking of the ship to kill off his enemies. It is a zany idea for a play, even if it lies on the outer realms of conspiracy theory. Emma (Genevieve Gaunt), a young British woman mourning the loss of her beau, arrives in New York to unearth hidden facts herself and coincidentally meets a jaded newspaper hack, Molloy (John Hopkins). He promptly offers to help her in order to sell her story to the papers and early scenes alternate between their meeting and his exchanges with his editor (Lizzy McInnerny) who – again coincidentally – lost her own lover in the maritime disaster. Under the direction of Eoin O’Callaghan, this set-up promises a corporate murder mystery as Emma and Molloy begin their investigations. A ship engineer (Fergal McElherron) speaks of structural failures in the Titanic’s design and warns: “Ask the wrong questions and you get a hatchet in the head.” But as competent as the performances are, this play goes nowhere dramatically. Instead, it swims around in exposition, with flimsy, cliched characters and little beyond theories being spoken out loud. Its action – what little there is – feels static, almost sleepy, despite the colourful premise, and we can hear the creaks of its plot turns. It is touching that Hutchinson dedicates the play to his grandfather, a shipfitter on the Titanic who died from injuries sustained in the shipyard. It is also ambitious in its intention to bring together the idea of fake news with psychoanalytic aspects of reality, fantasy and neurosis (Freud’s “new science” is briefly mentioned). But it does not succeed in exploring this ground with any depth or coherence, and it never becomes clear what it is ultimately trying to say.

3/15/2022,"Police in New York were on Monday still looking for a suspect who stabbed two employees at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) on Saturday, after being denied entry due to a revoked membership. The suspect, whom police identified as Gary Cabana, 60, was seen on surveillance video jumping over a reception desk and stabbing two employees, the New York Times reported. Police said Cabana’s membership was revoked due to two prior incidents of disruptive behavior. Cabana received a letter on Friday rescinding his membership, but showed up to the museum on Saturday saying he wanted to watch a film. In video, Cabana is seen hopping over the reception desk with a knife and cornering three employees. After stumbling into a wall, Cabana proceeds to attack the employees who are hiding underneath a desk. Two employees were stabbed. A third managed to run past the suspect after a museum security guard, standing on the other side of the desk, threw what appeared to be a large binder at Cabana, temporarily distracting him. One victim, a 24-year-old woman, was stabbed in the back and neck. The second, a 24-year-old man, was stabbed in the left collarbone. Both were taken to Bellevue hospital and listed in stable condition. The attack happened just after 4pm ET, one of the museum’s busiest times, CBS reported. The last known address for Cabana was at a supportive housing unit in Manhattan run by the non-profit Breaking Ground, which provides housing for low-income people, people with mental illness and those who have been diagnosed with HIV/Aids, the Times said. A user writing as Cabana has remained active on social media, making a series of posts. One post on Facebook said he had bipolar disorder and was “triggered” by a woman who told him to quiet down during a film. “Bipolar is a tough road to hoe,” the user wrote. “Dr Jekyll to Mr Hyde. THEN U get framed ind [sic] evicted from MoMA (not just the movies, ALL THE ART too) by a bitter old woman who shushes U when U LAUGH during a comedy.” In further messages to a reporter at the New York Post, the user blamed workers at the museum, accusing them and a woman named as Barbara of conspiring to ban him and noting that he was upset at not being able to see Starry Night, a painting by Vincent van Gogh. “The stabbed girls were in on the BACKSTABBING too,” the user wrote. “I don’t backstab, I do the frontside only.” Police said they were aware of the social media posts and were investigating.

3/15/2022,"John Oliver took a deep dive into the industry of exorbitant pricing for live events on Sunday’s Last Week Tonight, and in particular the company Ticketmaster – or, as he called it, “one of the most hated companies on earth”. The average price for a popular concert has more than tripled since the mid-90s, vastly outpacing inflation, and that’s before the resale market. As the biggest player in the ticket market, Ticketmaster claims that “they strive to put fans first, and that the people we care most about are the fans,” Oliver explained. “And yet, as anyone who has ever bought from them knows, that’s generally not the feeling you get when you’re dealing with them.” That starts with ticket fees, which “can range from the annoying to the completely batshit”, said Oliver. His research staff found a ticket to a 2019 Kidz Bop concert with fees that amounted to 75% of face value; fees for a Tyler, the Creator concert in Florida next week amounted to 78% of face value. Ticketmaster has said their fees are determined “in collaboration with our clients” who “share in a portion of the fees we collect” – venues, promoters and sometimes the artists themselves. But some of those “other parties” also include Ticketmaster, because in 2010, the company merged with Live Nation, which owns or operates most of the top music venues in the US. The company has had “somewhat of a chokehold” on live entertainment since, Oliver explained, pointing to a 2020 justice department memo alleging that the company had strong-armed venues into using Ticketmaster and retaliated against venues that refused its services. That investigation also found that Ticketmaster often holds back the vast majority of tickets from the general public for the resale market, where they are mostly bought by professional ticket brokers with bots – “as I’m sure you all assumed, all of those stupid ‘are you a robot?’ tests have very much not kept them all out,” Oliver quipped. Brokers flip those tickets on the secondary market for a huge mark-up on sites like SeatGeek, Stubhub and Ticketmaster, again. “These sites badly want you to think of them as fan-to-fan marketplaces,” said Oliver. “But the truth is, resale sites are not just fan-to-fan at all.” A government accountability report from 2018 found that the “overwhelming majority” of ticket sales on these sites were conducted by professional ticket brokers, marked up anywhere from 49% (on average) to as high as 7,000% (a One Direction concert). “Ticket-selling sites go out of their way to cater to their broker clients, because they bring them in a lot of money,” Oliver continued. For example, the company has allegedly not cracked down on ticket brokers with multiple accounts to circumvent purchase limits. To quote one Ticketmaster rep, asked by an undercover reporter at a 2018 ticket broker conference how many brokers use multiple accounts: “I’d say pretty damn near every one of them.” “Now, I have to tell you Ticketmaster insists that it spends millions on technology to weed out bad behavior and that that employee’s comments were not reflective of its policies,” said Oliver. “But even taking them at their word – which I am not inclined to do – their whole system is designed to be opaque,” especially on secondary sellers, which are kept anonymous. Finally, there is the “uncomfortable fact”, said Oliver, of what a ticket is actually worth. “An economist will tell you it’s worth whatever people will pay,” he explained. “So if someone is willing to spend over $2,000 including fees for an Adele ticket” – the going price for one to her Vegas residency – “that is what it’s worth, as gross as that sounds. But if Adele doesn’t want to charge that, there is going to be a gap between the face value of the ticket and what someone can get for it, and a whole industry is going to scramble in to exploit it. “When you take all of this together,” he later concluded, “the reason tickets are so hard to get when they’re on sale is that they’re often not on sale, and the reason they cost so much on the secondary market is that you’re paying exorbitant fees to the platform and might be buying from a broker or in rare cases, even from the artist themselves.” The whole ticket-selling ecosystem “enriches a lot of people who do not contribute anything to the actual show that you’re paying to see,” he added. “And at the center of all of this is Ticketmaster, because it turbo-charged many of these shitty practices that have now become industry standard.” What can be done? Oliver called on Congress to pass policies that would force transparency on ticket-selling sites, “but the truth is, much of the power here is actually in the hands of the artists. Because the biggest ones could do things to tamp down the secondary market,” such as making their tickets non-transferable or offering platforms for fans to resell tickets without a profit, as Pearl Jam did before its 2020 tour was cancelled. “But if regulators don’t act and artists don’t have the clout or the inclination to require companies to put those guardrails in place,” he concluded, “I’m afraid you as a fan are going to remain vulnerable to the worst parts of this system.”",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver rips Ticketmaster and live music costs: ‘One of the most hated companies on earth’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/14/john-oliver-ticketmaster-live-music-costs
3/15/2022,"Ukraine’s war-ravaged economy could shrink by up to 35% this year if Russia’s invasion becomes a protracted conflict, the International Monetary Fund has warned. In an initial assessment, the IMF said the loss of life, damage to critical infrastructure, trade disruption and an outflow of refugees would lead to gross domestic product falling by a minimum of 10% in 2021. However, it stressed that the experience of other countries affected by recent wars, such as Iraq and Syria, suggested the impact could be much more severe. The IMF also said the war – which has already led to a sharp rise in energy prices – would cause “devastating” damage to the global economy. Last week, the IMF announced a $1.4bn package of emergency financial support to help the country cope with the growing financial costs of a war that has resulted in almost half the banks shutting and the central bank struggling to deliver cash to branches and ATMs. “While geopolitical tensions with Russia had already curtailed Ukraine’s access to markets, the escalation to an invasion of Ukraine by Russia and full-blown war on 24 February has dramatically altered Ukraine’s outlook,” a report prepared by IMF staff said. “A deep recession and large reconstruction costs are to be expected, on the backdrop of a humanitarian crisis. With the war ongoing, the situation remains extremely fluid, and any forecast is at this stage subject to massive uncertainty.” The report noted Ukraine faced a “massive” humanitarian shock, with indications of rapidly increasing loss of life and sizeable infrastructure destruction across the country. Air and seaports had been closed, and substantial damage had been incurred at Mariupol (through which 50% of total exports are shipped) and a majority of the airports. A large number of roads and bridges had been destroyed, further crippling transportation and logistics. The IMF admitted there was “massive uncertainty” about the economic effects of the war but said instead of forecasting 3.5% growth this year it now expected a deep recession. The prediction of a 10% fall in GDP was based on a prompt end to the fighting and financial help from donor bodies. “However, the intensity of the ongoing conflict is causing widespread destruction to Ukraine’s productive capacity and rapidly worsening the outlook. Increasing loss of physical capital stock and mass migration would result in a significantly more pronounced output contraction, a collapse in trade flows, further diminished tax collection capacity, and a greater deterioration in the fiscal and external positions. “Data on wartime real GDP contraction (Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen) suggests that annual output contraction could eventually be much higher, in the range of 25-35%.” The previous conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which involved Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, led to Ukraine’s economy shrinking by 6.6% in 2014 and a further 10% in 2015. The IMF believes downside risks are “exceedingly” high and the longer the war goes on the more likely it is that Ukraine will suffer the sort of losses experienced in other conflict-affected countries. The IMF estimates Russia will also suffer a deep recession and will provide an estimate of the hit to output in its world economic outlook due out next month. Vladyslav Rashkovan, the IMF’s alternate executive director for Ukraine, said: “The prolongation of Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine, in addition to the humanitarian and economic losses, will also lead to significant spillover effects throughout the world: deterioration of food security, surging of energy and commodity process, rising inflationary pressures, disruption of supply chains, increasing social spending for refugees, and increasing poverty. The global economic damage of this war will be devastating.”",News/Business,"Ukraine economy could shrink by up to 35% in 2022, says IMF",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/14/ukraine-economy-shrink-2022-imf-russia-war
