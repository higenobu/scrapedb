12/20/2021,"Two babies survived a tornado in Kentucky last weekend that ripped the bathtub they were sheltering in out of the ground and tossed it with them inside, their grandmother said. Clara Lutz told WFIE-TV that she put 15-month-old Kaden and 3-month-old Dallas in the bathtub last Friday with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible. Then the house in Hopkins County started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. ""I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.” Lutz, who had been hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub, said she began looking everywhere among the wreckage for the children. Her house was stripped to the foundation. “All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee,’” she said. The bathtub was found in her yard, upside down, with the babies underneath. Authorities from the sheriff's office drove to the end of her driveway and reunited her with the two children, she said. Dallas had a big bump on the back of his head and had to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said. Lutz said the parents of the children live on the north end of the county and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado. At least 90 people have been confirmed dead across multiple states after more than 40 tornadoes pummeled a wide area last weekend. In Kentucky, state emergency management officials and the state health department put the current count at 75. The governor, who said his staff believes there are an additional three deaths, said Saturday that all of the people reported missing in the state after the outbreak of tornadoes have been accounted for.",U.S./Associated Press,2 babies survive tornado that carried them away in bathtub,https://news.yahoo.com/2-babies-survive-tornado-carried-162942972.html
12/20/2021,"China Peak Mountain Resort had a message for certain members of its customer base Sunday: Staff members are going to start cracking down on marijuana use at the ski area. “Just a gentle reminder,” the resort posted via Instagram, noting to folks that although legal in California, marijuana “use is illegal at our resort, as we are 100% on United States Forest Service federal land and must operate by their FEDERAL rules.” “Because of the complaints we have seen over the weekend, we have to crack down on its use at our resort starting now with staff in the parking lots as well (as) on lifts to ensure that we are all obeying the rules.” Those caught using marijuana “will be removed from the resort for the day, no exceptions.” Further resistance will result in customers having their season pass “voided for the rest of this season and you will not be allowed to purchase a pass in 2022/23.” “Please do not make us play this game!” the post concluded. “We want to keep China Peak fun for everyone and maintain good standing with USFS. Thank you for your understanding.”",U.S./Fresno Bee,High on the mountain?
