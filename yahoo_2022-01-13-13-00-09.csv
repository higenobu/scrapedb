1/13/2022,"Burhan Chowdhury, of Hamtramck, Michigan, told a judge he had been too weak to clean up his yard. Judge Alexis G. Krot said he should be ashamed and that she would give him jail time if she could. Chowdhury's son said he usually helps his dad with the yard but he was out of the country. A Michigan judge berated a 72-year-old man on Monday after he told her he had failed to keep up with the maintenance of his yard because his cancer treatments made him very weak. In a video of the exchange, Burhan Chowdhury, of Hamtramck, Michigan, can be heard struggling to breathe as he explained his situation to 31st District Judge Alexis G. Krot. ""You should be ashamed of yourself,"" Krot could be heard saying in the video. ""If I could give you jail time on this, I would."" She then issued him a $100 fine, adding: ""You've got to get that cleaned up. That is totally inappropriate."" The man's son, Shibbir Chowdhury, 33, who appeared with his father for the Zoom hearing, spoke up to clarify that his father was sick and that the property had already been cleaned up. ""Do you see that photo?"" Krot asked. ""That is shameful. Shameful. The neighbors should not have to look at that."" Shibbir Chowdhury told The Washington Post that his father was diagnosed with lymph node cancer in 2019. He said he usually helps keep up the yard for his parents, but he was out of the country in Bangladesh for three months last year. He said the weeds grew out around his parents' house while he was gone. When he returned, his father told him they had received a ticket for noxious weeds and vegetation. Shibbir Chowdhury said he was shocked by the judge's reaction to the situation. ""She was telling my father, a sick person, that he should go to jail. That's ridiculous,"" he told The Post. ""You can't give a 72-year-old person jail time for not cleaning an alley."" ""I was really shocked by it. I didn't expect her to yell at us in this kind of a situation,"" he added. Shibbir Chowdhury said he is going to pay his father's fine and has received a lot of support from other people online and in their community. ""People understand that a situation like this can happen with someone who is old or sick,"" he said. Court records viewed by Insider showed the fine was paid on Wednesday. Krot was appointed by then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder in August 2016 and elected in November 2018. As a judge, she is unable to comment on the case, WDIV reported.

1/13/2022,"A man who took photos of himself inside the Capitol rotunda pleaded guilty to one count on Tuesday. Thomas Fee sent a selfie to his girlfriend's brother — a federal agent — during the siege. Fee faces up to six months in jail after pleading guilty to one count of parading. A New York man who sent photos of himself inside the Capitol building on January 6 to his girlfriend's brother — a federal agent — pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge connected to the attack. Thomas Fee, a retired firefighter from Freeport, New York, was arrested nearly one year ago after he turned himself in to authorities two weeks after the insurrection. On Tuesday, Fee, 54, pleaded guilty to one count of parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building, as first reported by WUSA. The charge carries a sentence of up to six months in prison. Following his 2021 arrest, Fee initially faced charges of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Federal prosecutors have offered several Capitol rioters the lesser parading charge in exchange for their guilty pleas. Dennis Ring, an attorney for Fee, told Insider that his client chose to resolve the case by pleading guilty to the single misdemeanor count of illegally demonstrating inside the Capitol. ""He has taken responsibility for his conduct and will accept the sentence Judge Bates dispenses,"" Ring said. Prosecutors identified Fee early on in the aftermath of the riot after he texted a photo and video of himself inside the Capitol to his girlfriend's brother, who worked for the US Diplomatic Service, according to charging documents. The special agent's wife first saw a Facebook post made by Fee's girlfriend saying Fee was at the pro-Trump ""Stop the Steal"" rally that preceded the riot, according to a criminal complaint. The agent then texted Fee, his sister's boyfriend, to ask if he was in Washington, DC, at the rally, investigators said. Fee responded by sending a selfie taken inside the Capitol rotunda amid scores of rioters. Fee also sent his girlfriend's brother a video of himself from inside the building where other rioters can be heard screaming ""Pelosi"" and ""tyranny,"" the complaint said. In a text message accompanying the video, Fee reportedly said he was ""at the tip of the spear."" According to charging documents, the unnamed special agent initially deleted the messages but was later able to revive them, after which he sent them to DSS. The agency then sent the evidence to the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Following his January arrest, WABC reported that Fee was working as a firefighter during the September 11 attacks. He was also reportedly honored for rescuing 13 people, including a pregnant woman and children, during Hurricane Sandy. However, as a volunteer firefighter in Hempstead 2004, Fee was suspended after being accused of yelling racial slurs at a Black doctor who walked by the firehouse a couple of times, the outlet reported. More than 730 people have been arrested in connection to the deadly attack and more than 170 have pleaded guilty so far.

1/13/2022,"A man accused of pushing an Asian commuter into the path of an approaching subway train in New York City last May has been arrested after groping a woman, police announced on Tuesday.

Ronald Lacey, 23, allegedly shoved the victim, 35, in the direction of an F train at the 21st Street-Queensbridge Station in Long Island City at around 7:45 a.m. on May 24, 2021.

Bystanders reportedly flagged down the train and pulled the victim up to safety.

The victim, who then lost consciousness on the platform, sustained a fractured wrist and a deep wound that required 14 stitches.

“Without provocation, this defendant allegedly shoved a man from the platform of the subway onto the tracks with a train entering the station,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a statement, according to QNS. “This could have ended with tragic results if not for the quick action of the good Samaritans.”

At the time of the attack, Lacey had pending charges of possession of a weapon, menacing and harassment for an incident that had occurred the week prior; however, he was released without bail the next day, according to the New York Daily News.

He was finally arrested on Jan. 7, for grabbing a 31-year-old woman’s buttocks at the Union Square Station on Dec. 8, 2021.

Lacey has been charged with attempted murder in the second degree, assault in the first degree, reckless endangerment in the first degree and harassment in the second degree, according to Sunnyside Post.

Police initially investigated the subway attack as a possible hate crime, but Lacey has not been charged with any hate crimes following the incident.

The 23-year-old will return to court today. If convicted, he will face up to 25 years in prison.

1/13/2022,"“I think, in many respects, Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will, ultimately, find just about everybody,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci yesterday during a “fireside chat” with the Center for Strategic & International Initiatives. His comment came one day after the U.S. set an all-time record for daily infections, at 1.4 million, and also for test positivity, at 26%, per Johns Hopkins University. Fauci went on to reference statements he made last year in which he said Covid would likely not be eradicated, but controlled, becoming an endemic problem, rather than a pandemic. More from Deadline Record-Breaking 1.4 Million New Daily Covid Cases In U.S.; Hospitalizations, Test Positivity Also Hit All-Time Highs 'Chicago PD' Pauses Production After Positive Covid Tests Covid Deaths Begin To Rise In Los Angeles; Wave Believed Tied To Beginning Of December Omicron Case Surge “It’s no way, I believe, likely – I mean, aspirational, but not likely – that we’re going to eliminate it because, A.) it has a high degree of transmissibility; B.) variants arise; and C.) there are so many people that are unvaccinated. And we eliminated polio because we got almost everybody vaccinated. We eliminated measles because we got almost everybody vaccinated.” The U.S. currently has 63% of its population vaccinated. Last June, President Biden outlined a plan to have 70% of adults — then the only Americans eligible for the vaccines — get vaccinated by July 4. The country did not achieve that goal. The percent of adults vaccinated is certainly higher now but the goal posts have shifted now that Americans as young as 5 are eligible to receive the shots. Even with the vaccines available to a greater swath of the U.S. population, the number of daily vaccinations has fallen precipitously from a 7-day moving average of 1.7 million in early December to about 900,000 this week. Given that, the goal of eradication seems less possible now than it may have least summer. CDC “People who are going to be vaccinated, we’ve seen that curve flattening out,” Dr. Tony Napolitano, whose company Wellstand provides testing services to events and film and TV productions, told Deadline last week. “I don’t think you can move the needle much on vaccination. So what’s left is social distancing, testing and masking, those type of things.” Given that, says Fauci, there is now another goal. “So what’s the box that we’re all looking at now? That box is control, namely, getting the level of infection that causes severe disease low enough that we can incorporate this infection – some people have said learning to live with it – that I believe we are possibly approaching that,” he said. “Now, the reason I say possibly is that we still now have close to a million infections a day, we have [a record] 150,000 people in the hospital, and over 1,200 to 1,300 die. So we’re not at that point where this is an acceptable ‘let’s live with it’ now. But I believe we will get there.” Acting head of the FDA, Janet Woodcock, told a Senate committee yesterday that not only will most people get Covid, but the nation’s focus may need to change, and ensuring the operability of emergency services is key right now. “I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is [that] most people are gonna get Covid,” said Woodcock. “And what we need to do is make sure that the hospitals can still function [and that] transportation [and] other essential services are not disrupted while this happens. I think after that will be a good time to reassess how we’re approaching this pandemic.” Fauci, for his part, said those and other practical matters are still a reason for Americans to get vaccinated. “Those who have been vaccinated and vaccinated and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death. “Unfortunately, those who are still unvaccinated are going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this,” he said.

1/13/2022,"Price levels continue to rise at a rate we haven’t seen in decades. In December, U.S. consumer prices surged 7% on a year-over-year basis, the fastest pace since June 1982, when inflation hit 7.1%. If you’re hoarding cash, spiking inflation means serious consequences for your savings. Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike. In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two characteristics that help companies thrive amid high inflation: an ability to increase prices easily and an ability to take on more business without having to spend too much. In other words, invest in asset-light businesses with pricing power. Here are three Berkshire holdings that fit the description. American Express demonstrated its pricing power quite recently as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 all the way to $695. The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment. American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills. In fact, business is already booming, as the company’s revenue jumped 25% year over year to $10.9 billion in Q3. American Express is the third-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway, only behind Apple and Bank of America. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth over $24 billion. Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller. Yes, American Express trades at over $170 per share. But you can get a smaller piece of the company using investing apps that allow you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1%. Coca-Cola is a classic example of a so-called “recession-resistant” business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a simple can of Coke is still affordable to most people. The company’s entrenched market position also gives it some pricing power. Besides, Coca-Cola can always rely on a trick it’s used in the past: keeping its prices the same but subtly reducing its bottle size. Factor in its strengths from its iconic brand portfolio and the fact that its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago. It has survived — and thrived — in many periods of high inflation. Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $23.1 billion. At current prices, you can lock in a dividend yield of 2.8% on Coca-Cola's shares. No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal, but consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway. Earlier this year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones. While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying as much about a drop in sales volume. Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing more than 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. One of the reasons behind that concentration is the sheer increase in the tech giant’s stock price. Over the past five years, Apple shares have surged more than 500%. Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 1.7%. 4 Ways to Earn Big Returns in 2022 Without the Shaky Stock Market Jim Rogers: Next Bear Market Will Be ‘Worst in My Lifetime’ — He'll Rely on 3 Assets Robert Kiyosaki Says We're Already in a 'Technical Depression' — He's Using These 3 Assets for Protection This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

1/13/2022,"Monday won’t be all picnics and parades. While many workers across the region have a day off for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, law enforcement officers will be out in full force. For reasons that still are not that clear, on MLK Day, South Florida roads, even the interstate, morph into a into giant free-for-all. It’s a daredevil’s playground with hundreds of people on dirt bikes and ATVs, whizzing down the roads recklessly, sometimes by the hundreds, darting around motorists . They pop wheelies and some even stand on the vehicles that are meant for off-roading. It’s unlawful to take such vehicles on public roads. Over the years the pack has been known to careen down sidewalks, clog roadways, drive at break-neck speeds, even intentionally veer the wrong way on roads. Called Wheels Up, Guns Down, this is not a sanctioned event like Spring Break, officials say, but a way for reckless, unlawful motorists to get attention on social media. Some of the packs of bikers have become so organized they even have stage-hands on motorcycles filming the dangerous stunts and posting the footage to social media. “[They] do so with total disregard for public safety and that is where I draw the line in the sand,” Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony said on Wednesday. “One of our core responsibilities is to protect the community and we won’t stand ideally by.” Fines for those riding unlawfully on public roads will be steep — more than $1,100, said Major Robert Chandler of the Florida Highway Patrol. Chandler said every trooper from Miami-Dade to Palm Beach counties will be working Monday to try to deter the reckless behavior and track down those who are participating. “We will outnumber you,” Chandler said, promising there will not be any warnings. Undercover officers also will be working. Troopers and other law enforcement agencies won’t just be on the ground; there will be plenty of law enforcement officers in helicopters using surveillance equipment. “There will be so many aircraft in the air that there is no way these motor-bikers can get away from law enforcement,” Chandler said. “At some point we are going to be in a position where we can safely make an arrest and take the bikes.” Chandler said there are a couple of proposals currently filed in Tallahassee that, if approved by the Legislature, could change the state’s road-racing statute allowing for criminal penalties and not just traffic citations and fines. If the statute is toughened, law enforcement could impound the dirt bikes and ATVs as well. Chandler and Tony encouraged regular motorists to pull off to the side of the road if they encounter a group on dirt bikes and ATVs this weekend and Monday. “You may not see us but we are there, monitoring, tracking, taking individuals into custody safely without exposing any of you to more harm,” Tony said.
