4/5/2022,"Covid-related deaths in England have jumped to their highest level since mid-February, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). There were 780 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the seven days leading up to 25 March – up 14% on the previous week. This increase follows several weeks where deaths appeared to have levelled off. Coronavirus infections have been rising across the UK since early March, driven by the Omicron BA.2 variant. Prevalence of the virus is currently at a record high, with ONS figures suggesting approximately 4.9 million had Covid in the week to 26 March. This increase may now be having an impact on the number of deaths, which typically lag behind infections by several weeks. The death toll is the highest since 18 February when 863 deaths were recorded – although this is still lower than at the peak of the first the Omicron wave when 1,484 deaths were registered in England and Wales in the week to 21 January. It is also well below the 8,433 deaths registered at the peak of the second wave of coronavirus in the week to 29 January 2021. In total 190,053 deaths have now occurred in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the ONS. The number of people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus is close to the total reached at the start of this year but is still far below levels recorded in early 2021. This relatively low number of deaths and hospitalisations largely reflects the success of the vaccination programme – in particular the rollout of booster doses at the end of 2021. A fourth “spring booster” dose of vaccine is being offered to people aged 75 and over, care home residents and those aged 12 and over with weakened immune systems.",News/World news,Covid-related deaths rise in England with infections at record high,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/covid-related-deaths-rise-england-infections-record-high
4/5/2022,"It’s a generic title, and this brooding Australian indie sports drama itself feels a bit generic: you’ll probably guess the ending seven minutes into the movie. Still, it’s well-acted, particularly by Levi Miller who plays 15-year-old swimming prodigy Benjamin, known to everyone as “Boy” – a transcendent athlete gifted with Michael Phelps levels of talent. Miller impressively looks the part: strong legs, broad back, shoulders as wide as the Sydney Harbour Bridge. What’s more, he manages to bring a spark of personality to a character who for chunks of the movie is a super-focused obsessive swimming machine. The film begins four months before the Olympics trials. Scouts from an elite sports institute in Brisbane are sniffing around; but then Boy’s dad Rob (Jason Isaacs) is released from prison – news that makes the front page of the local paper. Before jail, he was a violent alcoholic who terrorised his family; now he’s a spent force, broken and needy. From hereon in, the storyline acquires a slightly inevitable pull: Boy becomes distracted in the pool, drifting into trouble. He reconnects with his older half-brothers, a pair of heavily tattooed beer-drinking wrong ’uns. Can he turn it around before the trials? The stakes are high. Boy’s mum repeatedly reminds him that swimming is his ticket out. For years she’s got up at 3am to drive him to practice. His coach says that he could be a national hero – or end up washing towels at the local sports centre. It’s an emotionally generous film: you don’t doubt that either of these adults love Boy. But aged 15, it’s as if he has ceased to be a child in their eyes – at the time when he needs support the most. I wondered too if first time writer-director Tyson Wade Johnston lets the men in Boy’s family off the hook a bit – explaining their toxic violence as dysfunction passing miserably, unstoppably down through generations.  Streamline is available on 11 April on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Streamline review – brooding swimming-prodigy drama makes a bit of a splash,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/05/streamline-review-sports-drama-australian
4/5/2022,"Captain Tom Westley Head coach Anthony McGrath It was something of a shock when Essex failed win the Championship last year after lifting the trophy in 2017 and 2019 and the “Bob” in 2020. The die was set in late April when one-man wicket-muncher Simon Harmer went wicketless in the second innings at Edgbaston against Warwickshire (the eventual Champions), Essex’s first first-class defeat in 22 games. Harmer’s availability, now he’s returned to South Africa’s embrace, will be crucial, this year, as will the form of Alastair Cook, who has signed a two-year deal. Off the field, fallout from a bad-tempered winter rumbles on.Prediction Fourth (of 10) Captain Graeme van Buuren Head of cricket Dale Benkenstein Promotion – at last! Gloucestershire have waited three years to take up their first division berth earned in the autumn of 2o19, but kept performances up. A squad of batting bubbling with promise – Tom Lace, Chris Dent, and the unlucky James Bracey, spat out by the England machine last season – is backed up by the arrival of Marcus Harris. Off the field, the club continues to work tirelessly on its environmental status, pledging to meet net zero by 2040.Prediction Eighth Captain James Vince Team manager Adi Birrell Hampshire came within a snort of the Championship title in a thrilling game against Lancashire at the end of last season that they lost by one wicket. Captain James Vince was head and shoulders above the rest in that game, much as he had been all season. That somewhat fallible batting has been bolstered by the arrival of Ben Brown from Sussex and Nick Gubbins from Middlesex, while the bowling – Mohammad Abbas, Kyle Abbott, Keith Barker, Brad Wheal, Mason Crane and Liam Dawson – looks after itself, especially in April.Prediction Third Captain Sam Billings Head coach Matt Walker Bouncy Sam Billings, a breath of fresh air after his long drive to England’s final Ashes Test in Australia, will need all his enthusiasm to lead Kent to promotion. They didn’t win a game in 10 group matches last year, only finding their feet once hitting the bottom. Kent’s bowling resources though, will include Jackson Bird and later Matt Henry, plus Darren Stevens, the doyen of county cricket, still going strong in his mid-40s. Darren Stevens, he of Australian WhatsApp group fame, made 650 first-class runs and took 39 wickets last year, and he’s hungry for more.Prediction Ninth Captain Dane Vilas Head coach Glen Chapple The prospect of facing Hasan Ali and Jimmy Anderson with the new ball on an overcast Old Trafford morning will be enough to turn many batters green about the gills. Anderson, who took seven for 19 against Kent last year, while snapping up his thousandth first-class wicket, loves playing for Lancashire – the question is whether England will want him back. Alex Davies left for Birmingham in the off season, while Phil Salt makes the trip north and should slot into that vacant position in the top order. England may knock for Saqib Mahmood, Matt Parkinson and street-fighting batsman Josh Bohannon.Prediction Winners Captain Ricardo Vasconcelos Head coach John Sadler A tricky season lies ahead for Northants, who were promoted alongside Gloucestershire at the back end of 2019. Gloriously old-fashioned in outlook, they have the potential to pull off rabbit in the hat victories, but have lacked the tenacity to grind out match-winning Championship centuries – the twinkle-toed Ricardo Vasconcelos apart. A potential breakthrough season for all-rounder James Sales – son of David – who made his debut towards the end of last season, and played in England’s Under-19 World Cup final loss, while Northants expect typical reliability from seamer Ben Sanderson.Prediction Tenth Captain Tom Abell Head coach Jason Kerr After being nearly men for so long, Somerset’s red-ball season collapsed like a popped balloon in the autumn. The batting lineup, fragile as a shelf of china dolls, has been boosted by the arrival of Australian Matt Renshaw, who averaged 50 during his last spell with the club. Abell hopes Renshaw can nurture young blade Tom Lammonby and old hand James Hildreth. The bowling, a more comforting sight all round, is boosted by the arrival of Peter Siddle.Prediction Sixth Captain Rory Burns Interim head coach Gareth Batty The gulf between Surrey’s resources and their recent red-ball performances is one of the biggest mysteries in county cricket. It has been an off season of upheaval at The Oval, both in the boardroom and on the pitch, with a new interim coach in Gareth Batty, while the club said goodbye to three stalwarts in Rikki Clarke, Jade Dernbach and Liam Plunkett. Incoming are Chris Jordan, back to his old haunt, while Hashim Amla and Kemar Roach add familiar overseas pizazz. The biggest worry for Surrey fans may be whether Alec Stewart applies for the England men’s MD job.Prediction Fifth Captain Will Rhodes Head coach Mark Robinson Last year’s double title winners – Championship and Bob Willis Trophy – find themselves in the unexpected position of looking down at the rest. It was a true team performance that did it, with no batters averaging 40, and no bowlers taking 50 wickets, a squad exceptionally well led by Will Rhodes and overseen by the experienced eye of the director of cricket, Paul Farbrace. Down from Lancashire, Alex Davies adds some fizz, while young batsman Robert Yates impressed enough last season for commentators to be predicting him an Ashes berth.Prediction Second Captain Steve Patterson Head coach Ottis Gibson A possible points deduction hanging over their heads, Yorkshire start the season hoping to cling on for dear life after a nightmarish winter precipitated by Azeem Rafiq’s devastating evidence before the DCMS select committee. The EGM at the end of last month cleared the way for structural change at the club and lifted the ECB’s ban on international matches at Headingley, while Ottis Gibson and Darren Gough, the interim managing director, are bullish about wanting to put Yorkshire on the front and back pages for the right reasons. Fast bowler Haris Rauf should prove a spicy prospect on Headingley pitches that Gough hopes will be cooked just right.Prediction Seventh Captain Billy Godleman Head of cricket Mickey Arthur The club hope to turn around a miserable 2021 with the help of legendary homeworkgate coach Mickey Arthur, an international coach with Australia, South Africa, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. He has brought in stardust, with opener Shan Masood, who made a disciplined 156 against England on a dry pitch in 2020, and Suranga Lakmal, the Sri Lankan seamer, and is hopeful that their somewhat grizzled experience will sit well with the younger players. The batting looks particularly weak with the departures of Harvey Hosein (to retirement) and Matt Critchley (to Essex).Prediction Sixth (of eight) Captain Scott Borthwick Head coach James Franklin A plucky 2021 campaign gives the club something to build on, with South African Keegan Petersen joining David Bedingham (one of only five players to make 1,000 Championship runs last season) and new England cap Alex Lees to provide some ballast at the top of the order. Bowling has always been Durham’s favourite suit and Mark Wood (when fit) is the sprinkling on the cake of Ben Raine, Chris Rushworth and Brydon Carse (recovering from an injury on the Lions’ tour but expected to be back for the start of May).Prediction Second Captain David Lloyd Head coach Matthew Maynard Marnus Labuschagne and Glamorgan are, on paper, an unusual fit: one, the No 1-ranked Test batsman in the world, the other, a sometime-struggling county club. But, somehow, they are a perfect combination. Labuschagne will be joined by fellow Ashes player Michael Neser. The batting has been further bolstered by the addition of nearly-man Sam Northeast from Hampshire and Somerset’s Eddie Byrom, plus the talented Kiran Carlson who made three Championship centuries last year plus a sparkling 88 in front of the Sky cameras against Yorkshire.Prediction Third Captain Colin Ackermann Head coach Paul Nixon The club most often mentioned in dispatches when people grumble about the 18-team Championship, also had a stressful winter with the departure of chair Mehmooda Duke, the only female and one of two people of colour in the role. The club have a new director of cricket in Claude Henderson, who quickly signed his compatriot Beuran Hendricks, a left-arm swing bowler, while only Simon Harmer picked up more wickets in the Championship bowling spin than Callum Parkinson, Matt’s twin.Prediction Seventh Captain Peter Handscomb Head coach Richard Johnson Stuart Law’s disappointing period in charge came to an end when Middlesex found themselves in Division Three for the back end of the season. His replacement is Richard Johnson, an old hand at Lord’s, who made the star signing of the Championship in Shaheen Shah Afridi to back up an already solid pace attack. It is the batting that has caused the most raised eyebrows over the last few years, and Handscomb will be hoping for more luck himself after a painful 2021, though Mark Stoneman made a successful hop across the Thames mid-season last year.Prediction Fourth Captain Steven Mullaney Head coach Peter Moores Having at last found their red-ball form in 2021 after nearly two years without a win, it was a cruel blow for Nottinghamshire to find themselves back in Division Two. Few doubt they will come storming back, with a formidable pace attack to terrify some of the second division’ batting lineups. Overseas signings Dane Paterson and James Pattinson line up alongside Luke Fletcher and Stuart Broad, who has a point to prove. The batting lineup also has fizz, with Haseeb Hameed back from a disappointing Ashes and Joe Clarke, said to be in bubbling in England’s sights.Prediction First Interim captain Tom Haines Head coach Ian Salisbury A summer of disappointment followed by a winter of discontent, things can only get better at Hove. Sussex managed to pick up just one red-ball win in 2021, but their hotch-potch of youthful talent including Dan Ibrahim, who – at 16 – became the youngest player to make 50 in Championship history against Yorkshire, bubble with promise. Salisbury also made a shrewd signing in Steven Finn, and one of the most thrilling overseas acquisitions with Mohammad Rizwan.Prediction Fifth Captain Brett D’Oliveira Head coach Alex Gidman Jake Libby, who had a sparkling season with the bat last year, gets some support (at last) from new overseas player Azhar Ali, fresh from 185 against Australia at Rawalpindi. New captain Brett D’Oliverira doesn’t have an overflowing pot of resources, and, for the first time in over 18 years, Worcestershire have to march into battle without the familiar figure of Daryl Mitchell. He’ll be hoping for big returns from promising all-rounder Ed Barnard and seamer Josh Tongue.Prediction Eighth",Sport/Sport,County Championship 2022: team-by-team guide to the new season | Tanya Aldred,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/05/county-championship-2022-team-by-team-guide-to-the-new-season-cricket

4/5/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing a backlash from senior Tories over plans to privatise Channel 4, with former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson branding it “the opposite of levelling up”. Davidson led calls for the government to reconsider, along with former cabinet ministers Damian Green, and Jeremy Hunt. The scale of Conservative opposition to the proposals has already raised questions over whether the government has the votes to pass the required legislation through the House of Commons, with even tougher opposition expected in the House of Lords. Davidson said: “Channel 4 is publicly owned, not publicly funded. It doesn’t cost the taxpayer a penny. It also, by charter, commissions content but doesn’t make/own its own. It’s one of the reasons we have such a thriving [independent] sector in places like Glasgow. This is the opposite of levelling up.” Green pointed out the channel was founded by a Conservative government, with part of its remit being to boost Britain’s private sector television sector: “The sale of Channel 4 is politicians and civil servants thinking they know more about how to run a business than the people who run it. Very unconservative. Mrs Thatcher, who created it, never made that mistake.” Jeremy Hunt, a former culture secretary, told Sky News: “I’m not in favour of it because as it stands Channel 4 provides competition to the BBC on what’s called public service broadcasting – the kinds of programmes that are not commercially viable – and I think it would be a shame to lose that.” He said he had never considered privatising it when he was culture secretary. Another Tory who criticised the proposed sale was the father of the house, Peter Bottomley, who said it was “bad for the diversity of television, bad for viewers and bad for independent producers”. “It was considered in the mid-1990s and turned down. It should be rejected now,” he said. The backlash came after culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, pushed ahead with plans to privatise Channel 4, after 40 years in public ownership. The government hopes to raise about £1bn from the sell-off, making it one of the biggest privatisations since Royal Mail went public a decade ago. Ministers have suggested they could spend the proceeds to boost creative training and independent production companies, essentially funding their levelling up agenda. Julian Knight, the Conservative chair of the culture select committee, said he had concerns privatisation was “being done for revenge” after Channel 4’s critical coverage of Brexit and Johnson. He also said the potential sale proceeds are “irrelevant” in the scale of the national debt but that he would back a sale if it was part of an overhaul of all public service broadcasting. The plans have provoked a fierce reaction from the media industry, with prominent broadcasters such as Sir David Attenborough suggesting the government was pursuing an agenda of “shortsighted political and financial attacks” on British public service broadcasters. Channel 4’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, told staff of the news in an email on Monday night, saying: “We have been informed in the last hour that the government will shortly announce that the secretary of state has decided to proceed with the proposal to privatise Channel 4.” On Monday evening Dorries tweeted that public ownership was “holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon”. She added: “A change of ownership will give Channel 4 the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future.” The shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, described the move as “cultural vandalism”. She said: “Selling off Channel 4, which doesn’t cost the taxpayer a penny anyway, to what is likely to be a foreign company, is cultural vandalism. It will cost jobs and opportunities in the north and Yorkshire, and hit the wider British creative economy.”",News/Media,Senior Tories speak out against Channel 4 privatisation plans,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/05/senior-tories-speak-out-against-channel-4-privatisation-plans
4/5/2022,"Since the advent of industrial society, the ticking of the clock has governed the world of work. We set an alarm to wake up, we clock in, we clock out, we adhere to standard business hours or specified shifts, we’re beholden to time zones, deadlines and schedules, and our meetings are typically squeezed into fixed hour-long blocks of the day. But as businesses collectively reimagine the world post-pandemic and embrace hybrid models of working and more flexible scheduling, time no longer feels like the same constraint. Experts agree that the past two years have scrambled our sense of time. But what might this mean for how businesses operate? And how can technology help us be less beholden to the ticking clock? Let’s do the time warpHumans do not all experience time in the same way. “We don’t have a physical organ for time, the way that we do for other senses,” says Dr Aysha Motala, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Western Ontario’s Brain and Mind Institute. “That means that time is just super, super elastic. And that’s also why the pandemic has warped our sense of time.” But people appear divided on whether time has sped up or slowed down during the pandemic, and according to Motala, it depends on a range of factors such as stress levels, how busy you are, and how much social interaction you are experiencing. Remote and hybrid working has altered time constraints in other ways – collapsing geographic time zones for some teams and liberating many workers from the traditional nine to five. Likewise, meetings held via video call can be more easily wrapped up if the discussion is done in less than the allotted hour. And, perhaps more profoundly, many of us have experienced a new sense of mastery over both time and space thanks to our ability to flip between meetings in different parts of the city without having to sit in a traffic jam or navigate public transport delays. The impact of these changes on businesses go beyond efficiency and flexibility. For instance, virtual work and asynchronous scheduling have allowed businesses to dramatically widen the potential talent pool, with teams drawn from across time zones and geographies. Of course, a more malleable approach to business hours can have a negative impact on people’s work-life balance and boundaries if it isn’t properly managed. But, when safeguards are in place to protect people’s wellbeing, the new fluidity of time can also be empowering for employees – helping them to stay more in tune with human nature. Natural rhythmsHybrid working practices have also helped many find rhythm in their workday that feels more natural to them. Take napping, for example. In a world of hybrid working, there’s no need to feel guilty about putting your feet up and getting a bit of shuteye in the middle of the day. In fact, it could be exactly what your body needs. “Broadly speaking, a short 20-minute nap is fine. It can enhance your ability to process information and be functional during the second half of the working day,” says Prof Russell Foster, director of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, Oxford. “[Any] longer than 20 minutes, you tend to go down into deeper sleep. And recovery from that deeper sleep can leave you foggy for quite some time.” Foster notes that our internal biological clocks vary from person to person. “It’s like shoe size – one size does not fit all,” he says. “I think the key thing is that we need to be sensitive to our own needs and organise our life where possible accordingly.” Working through itSo how should managers and employees leverage all these societal shifts and our natural biological rhythms to make the most of our working days – and without neglecting the work that needs to get done? “Splitting up your day into segments of time can help establish some sense of routine,” says Motala. This could mean, for example, telling yourself not that you need to file those TPS reports today, but that you need to finish writing them by lunchtime. Tools that manage your workflow have also become increasingly useful, bringing logic and organisation to what might otherwise be fairly unstructured ways of working. Workflow platforms can help businesses better manage the way a particular task or job is completed by breaking down each stage of the process. Businesses can thereby unbundle certain processes, putting the constituent tasks into a kind of team pool and allowing managers to reapportion tasks in a way that lets people work more as they wish. This also increases the scope for automation, as machines can much more effectively manage tasks when all the data and input required is in one place. That’s particularly impactful when it comes to the kind of rote, mind-numbing tasks that eat up time but provide minimal satisfaction. The end result is more fulfilling and empowering work. And, of course, these tools can be especially helpful when teams are working across time zones. Software can also assign tasks to people in a way that allows companies to operate more flexibly and effectively. This can help managers resolve potential conflicts caused by newly flexible working arrangements, such as the tendency of staff to opt to come into the workplace mid-week and work remotely on Mondays and Fridays. Digital workflows such as those provided by ServiceNow can help HR departments manage these so-called “midweek mountains” by sending people notifications when members of a team come into the office. So as scrambled as we might feel by our shifting notions of time, perhaps we should also be optimistic about the new rhythm of the working day. Flexible schedules, combined with new tools to manage our work, mean that we can live more in tune with our bodies – and even get better results at work too. Empower people with digital workflows and wherever work goes, make it flow.

4/5/2022,"Book now Whether it’s asking for a payrise, giving a team member feedback they might not want to hear, turning down a job offer, speaking to a manager about their lack of boundaries, or simply saying something you’d rather not, it’s in our nature to avoid those conversations that we know won’t be easy. There is biological science behind this: our brains are wired to constantly scan for threats, and this means that they often communicate the worst to us. When it comes to tough conversations, this will mean putting it off, procrastinating and delaying - or even avoiding it permanently, at the expense of our own long-term fulfilment or happiness. There is a way to break this cycle. As you will discover in this interactive masterclass with coaches Lisa Quinn and Nicky Chambers, the process begins with listening to what’s actually going on, and recognising the truth of your thoughts and beliefs - rather than letting them unconsciously dictate your behaviour. Difficult conversations are difficult for a reason. We care about the outcome, and this means that if we avoid them, we’re suppressing emotions that will leak out elsewhere. In this class, you will learn how to identify how you choose to behave in different situations, and then utilise a clear and evidence-based framework to help you stop avoiding and start doing. Anyone who struggles with having difficult conversations, from experienced leaders to those just starting out in their career Understanding what makes a conversation difficult How to listen to, and hear, what is actually going on Recognising the truth of our thoughts, beliefs and feelings Examining your ‘story’ around difficult conversations How to prepare for the worst outcome Exploring how we’re choosing to behave How to develop a proactive approach Lisa Quinn and Nicky Chambers met while they were training in 2017.

4/5/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. It is now becoming a running joke that massive games-industry news keeps dropping in the hours after this newsletter gets sent out on a Tuesday. A few months back it was Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard; then the New York Times bought Wordle. Last week it was Sony’s rumoured revamp of the PlayStation Plus subscription service, and then the not entirely unexpected news that E3 – the annual games industry showcase in LA – has been completely cancelled, having previously shifted to a digital-only event. I am not going to spend long mourning the loss of E3, whose relevance to anyone other than games industry marketers, developers and journalists has long been waning. I hope it returns next year; if it doesn’t, I will miss the annual gathering in LA, and the buzz of covering live news and interviewing people as it happens. You don’t get to do that much on my beat. Like much of the entertainment industry, games news tends to be very tightly scheduled and controlled by publishers and marketers, so you are very rarely in a situation where you’re having to report reactively on the ground. But where else could you be playing some random VR horror game financed by Elijah Wood, freak out and take off the headset, only to discover you were being watched by Hideo Kojima and his entourage? Sony’s revamp of PlayStation Plus, however, is something that has implications for all of us. For many years now, if you paid your £40 a year to play games online on a PlayStation 4 or 5, you’d get a couple of free games every month. It’s been a popular and generous offer for players, and the free games were often a mix of expensive hits like Uncharted and great indie games that people might not otherwise have played. Now, PlayStation Plus is becoming something a bit more like Microsoft’s Netflix-of-games Game Pass subscription: for £83.99 a year, you get access to a vast catalogue of about 400 games, dating back to the original PlayStation and running right up to last year’s PlayStation 5 sci-fi masterpiece Returnal. For £100 a year, you can stream them all rather than downloading them. There’s one big difference here from Xbox’s Game Pass: Microsoft offers every single new game it launches as part of that subscription, for £10.99 a month – from Forza Horizon to the forthcoming Bethesda role-playing epic Starfield. Sony will continue to launch new games as standalone purchases, for £60 to £70. And presumably it will be a while before those games find their way into the Plus catalogue. This is a bit like movies screening in cinemas and coming out on Blu-ray first before appearing on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Explaining that decision, Sony’s Jim Ryan said, “The level of investment that we need to make in our studios would not be possible [if we included every new game in the subscription], and we think the knock-on effect on the quality of the games that we make would not be something that gamers want.” This speaks to something significant about Microsoft’s approach: one strongly suspects that Game Pass is loss-making, at least for now. That company has impossibly deep pockets; it just spent $70bn on an embattled publisher, after all. Sony and Nintendo cannot compete on those terms. Offering all its new games as part of a subscription would destroy Sony’s profitability – which should come as no surprise, when we see how streaming services have already affected the music, TV and film industries. For now, PlayStation Plus is supplementing – rather than replacing – game sales. If you have a PlayStation and you’re not fussed about playing the latest games as soon as they come out, it looks like you could save significant money by paying for a Plus subscription instead of three or four full-price new games a year. That’s if your bank account can sustain yet another direct debit: between Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Switch Online, Spotify, Netflix, Disney+, Apple Music and whatever other entertainment subscriptions you’re paying for, it’s terrifyingly easy to be spending upwards of £50 a month on this stuff. This is one reason I’m not immensely keen on the idea of an all-streaming future. In that scenario, either one company wins out, eats all the other ones and we’re left with one subscription … or we’ve all got so many subscriptions going, it’s an unsustainable drain on our finances. Neither of those looks like the path to a healthy video-games industry to me. I’m handing over to our games correspondent and all-round legend Keith Stuart for this week’s recommendation, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga: “When my sons were very young, the first games they really got to grips with were the Lego titles. We started on Lego Indiana Jones then worked through them all, from Harry Potter to Lord of the Rings to Marvel Super Heroes. I loved watching them begin to understand how puzzles and stories worked in games. Fast-forward (oh how fast it’s been) to 2022 and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a lovely reminder of why these games are so beloved. A genuinely funny script, intriguing quests and a solid grasp of the source material combine with excellent visuals to create a warm, nostalgic experience that will feel genuinely therapeutic to regulars. I love how each of the nine movies is dealt with in bite-size chunks, so you can whiz through, say, The Phantom Menace in an hour or so. The characters are great – even Jar Jar is bearable – and the locations filled with life and detail. It’s made us all feel like little kids again.” Available on: PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PS4, PS5Approximate playtime: 15-20 hours As Elden Ring has millions of players seeking out, er, creative ways to overcome its challenges, Keith honours the long and inglorious history of cheesing: the act of winning in a game by any undignified means possible – not quite cheating but not quite … not cheating either. Are any of us above spamming a sweeping kick in a fighting game or hiding behind an indestructible wall to kill a boss? A win’s a win, right? Wargaming, the company that operates the enduringly popular World of Tanks online game, has pulled out of Russia and Belarus, where many of its operations were previously based. This is a huge deal: Wargaming was originally a Belarussian company and has now cut all ties with its country of origin, closing its studio in Minsk. It also has a large studio in Kyiv. In news that will delight everyone over the age of 35, there’s going to be a new Monkey Island game! From the original creators, Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman! It even involves the voice actor who played unlikely pirate hero Guybrush Threepwood in the original point-and-click comedy classics. It’s called Return to Monkey Island and it will be out in 2022. The sequel to Nintendo Switch masterpiece The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been delayed into next year. Honestly, I am slightly relieved. I still haven’t even started Elden Ring. In this game, vampires aren’t feral beasts – they’re the global elite Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between review – existential ponderings on the road to nowhere Why aren’t video games scary any more – am I just middle-aged and jaded? I’m going to indulge my inner agony aunt here for a minute, because reader Daniel has written in with a proper social conundrum. I’ll let him explain: “I’m in my late 30s and a senior(ish) member of staff working for an organisation that likes to take itself very seriously. I was sat in my office during my lunch hour playing a couple of rounds of Mario Kart 8 to relax after a long morning of meetings and calls when my CEO (in his late 50s) comes in to randomly tell me something and suddenly starts berating me for doing something that looks unprofessional and unsophisticated. He wouldn’t have said this if I were reading a book … In the moment, I was flabbergasted – I didn’t know what to say. Any tips and advice on how I could have handled myself better?” Oh Daniel! I have been in your position and I really feel for you! It is horrible to be ambushed by people’s baffling hostility towards video games, and it can feel very personally wounding, like a commentary on your character or maturity. Once I was being interviewed about Grand Theft Auto 5 on the radio, and the presenter interrupted me with “When I talk to people like you I always think, why don’t you just read a book?” (I told him I have a degree in comparative literature. That shut him up.) Unfortunately, in your situation you could hardly have just told your CEO to shove off and leave you in peace. But next time you could gently challenge the idea that video games are either unprofessional or unsophisticated with some facts that always seem to matter far more to people who don’t actually play them: games are the UK’s biggest entertainment sector, we have our own Baftas, the average age of a gamer in the UK is now 31, and 50% of all players are over 35 (23% are over 45). Failing that, one of the great benefits of the Nintendo Switch is that you can play it while eating lunch in the park.

4/5/2022,"Scott Morrison has declared he pursued contentious captain’s picks in New South Wales – sparking a destructive internal Liberal party brawl culminating in election-eve legal challenges – because he wanted to stand up “for the women in my team”. After the NSW court of appeal on Tuesday confirmed Morrison’s preferred candidates were valid, clearing the way for the federal election to be called, Morrison told the ABC he intervened in the process because “I’m asked all the time why won’t the prime minister do more about getting good women in parliament and stand up for the women in parliament”. “I stood up for the women in my team,” the prime minister told the 7.30 program. “Sussan Ley, one of my finest cabinet ministers and one of our most successful women members of parliament, was under threat … from factions within the Liberal party.” When it was pointed out to Morrison that his preferred candidates in his home state were demonstrably not all women, the prime minister said defending female candidates had been his primary motivation “and people know that”. Morrison said of the candidates selected during the federal intervention “50% were women and 50% were men”. The prime minister said his agenda was “ensuring we put the best candidates in the field to ensure that our government could put the best foot forward to ensure we continue to have a strong economy”. He decried “factional games” in the Liberal party. When it was pointed out to the prime minister he had his own allies and agendas, as everyone in professional politics does, Morrison declared he had “always stood up to the factions” – in the process accumulating enemies – because he did not allow people to “bully their way into getting the outcomes they want”. The calling of the election is now only days away but the government is struggling to find clear air to sell its cash splash budget – in large part because of the roiling in New South Wales. Morrison on Tuesday night attempted to downplay recent public excoriations from colleagues. The conservative stalwart Concetta Fierravanti-Wells chose budget night to brand the prime minister an “autocrat [and] a bully who has no moral compass” – an intervention sparking renewed debate about Morrison’s character. Fierravanti-Wells – who has recently been relegated to an unwinnable spot on the Liberal party’s NSW Senate ticket– on Tuesday night dismissed Morrison’s suggestion he was protecting women. “Great women? What bilge water! This is his code for ‘I want groupthink’! Morrison is simply using the ‘gender card’ to conflate captain’s picks to trash democratic processes in NSW,” she told 7.30 in a statement. Catherine Cusack, a NSW Liberal who announced two weeks ago she would resign from the state Legislative Council over her anger about flood relief, had lambasted the prime minister earlier on Tuesday. Cusack accused Morrison of having “ruined” the Liberal party, declaring he had “trashed” its values over two decades, first as state director, “then as a scheming MP and now as prime minister finding loopholes in our constitution to delay preselections in order to get his way”. Morrison told the ABC on Tuesday night he had known Cusack “for a long time” and suggested she had made similar criticisms of the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian. When it was put to Morrison that Berejiklian, too, had branded him “a horrible, horrible person” in a leaked text exchange, the prime minister said the former premier had denied saying that. Berejiklian actually said she couldn’t recall the exchange. As well as the public blasts from some colleagues, Morrison is also being dogged by renewed controversy about his own controversial preselection for Cook in 2007. Morrison said his critics were people with axes to grind. The prime minister said people had a tendency to lash out when they became “frustrated in the political process”. He suggested the recent interventions were timed to inflict maximum damage. Morrison said “as prime minister, you’ve got to take all the slings and arrows and I do”. He added: “I never lose my focus on the job … and I’ll always stand up to the things that are trying to take our government off in the wrong direction.” “As a prime minister, you can’t just say yes to everybody and give everybody what they want.” While Morrison’s captain’s picks were upheld by the court of appeal, Guardian Australia understands that the unsuccessful plaintiff, Matthew Camenzul, who is a member of the NSW state executive, will seek to appeal to the high court – although time is running out. Tuesday’s NSW court of appeal decision backed the preselection of two ministers, Ley and Alex Hawke, as the candidates for Farrer and Mitchell, respectively. Trent Zimmerman was confirmed as the candidate for North Sydney where he is facing a challenge from independent Kylea Tink and from Labor candidate Catherine Renshaw. Lawyer Jenny Ware will run in the winnable seat of Hughes, where she is up against two independents and the former member, Craig Kelly, who defected to the United Australia party. In Warringah, another lawyer, Katherine Deves, who has campaigned against transgender women being included in women’s sport, will run against independent Zali Steggall. The court of appeal case unsuccessfully challenged the actions of a three-person committee appointed by the federal Liberal party which included Morrison. The committee intervened in March after factional brawling within the NSW Liberal party had stalled the usual preselection processes leaving the party without candidates in several important seats. The committee twice briefly took over the troubled NSW branch and bypassed rank and file preselections to confirm candidates. The major parties are now in full campaign mode with the leaders and frontbenchers barnstorming marginal seats around the country. Morrison is expected to call the election over the coming days. The latest batch of opinion polls suggest the Coalition will begin the campaign trailing Labor.

4/5/2022,"In this series we ask authors, Guardian writers and readers to share what they’ve been reading recently. This month, recommendations include a page-turning tale of a toxic relationship, a pocket-sized poetry pamphlet and an allegory of what it means to be alive. Tell us what you’ve been reading in the comments. Until recently, I hadn’t been reading anything cover to cover for almost a year. I often got anxious, and kept putting books down. But I found myself bringing The Stories of Mary Gordon almost everywhere with me. I practised a kind of bibliomancy with it, asking a question that made me anxious, and letting a random word, sentence or paragraph present itself. The results required my own interpretation, but they were often surprising and helped me to make sense of what has happened in my life. In March, I regained some hope and energy and started reading short stories and poems again. I enjoyed Bora Chung’s Cursed Bunny, which my friend Anton Hur translated. I reread some poems from Khairani Barokka’s Ultimatum Orangutan. It’s an exciting book of poetry – everyone should try picking it up. And, last week, I finally bought Yōko Ogawa’s The Memory Police (translated by Stephen Snyder)! Such a harrowing allegory of what it means to be alive, to remember, to have a freedom to remember. Happy Stories, Mostly by Norman Erikson Pasaribu, translated by Tiffany Tsao (Tilted Axis £9.99) has been longlisted for the International Booker prize. To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply. I’ve been reading Acts of Desperation by Megan Nolan. The short, sharp chapters keep you turning pages long after you should have gone to bed! I’m a sucker for unlikable, flawed narrators and I loved this unnamed narrator’s internal dialogue as she navigates a toxic relationship. I recently read Preti Taneja’s second book, Aftermath – written from “the centre of a wound still fresh” – which allowed me to think through terror, trauma, grief and the genre in which we give it shape, violence, vulnerability, memory, complicity and empathy. It made me return to and reread fragments from Lola Olufemi’s Experiments in Imagining Otherwise. The resonances between these two radical texts, which offer, above all else, hope for humanity are remarkable and should be required reading for everyone.Like many others, I suspect I read Warsan Shire’s eagerly awaited debut poetry collection, Bless the Daughter Raised By a Voice in Her Head, greedily, in one giant gulp. It surpassed my expectations, and shortly after I turned the final page of this collection, I wanted more – more poems centred on coming-of-age experiences of women of colour in the diaspora. Pocket-sized, but packed with a punch, Fathima Zahra’s pamphlet, Sargam / Swargam, was the perfect follow-up. I’ve not read Kazuo Ishiguro before, but he’s one of those huge authors that everyone talks about that you feel like you should have read. I picked up Never Let Me Go on a whim, and was bowled over by the chatty intimacy of the first-person narrator. She leads us through a tender study of what it means to exist in a world where cloning has blurred the boundaries of humanity. In spite of the clones’ otherness, the trials and turmoil they go through are hauntingly similar to those we all experience as we muddle our way through life. For all its subtlety and depth it still managed to be a page-turner, and I finished it in a couple of days. It is a book that will stay with me for many years.",Arts/Books,What we’re reading: writers and readers on the books they enjoyed in March,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/05/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-they-enjoyed-in-march
4/5/2022,"Travel disruption continues for lorry drivers and holidaymakers on the Easter getaway, after the ferry company Stena Line was forced to suspend all sailings between Fishguard in south Wales and Rosslare in Ireland to fill the gaps left by the continued suspension of P&O Ferries services. Stena has cancelled all sailings between the Pembrokeshire port and the Republic of Ireland until 12 April. The company has moved the ship which would usually serve this route to Northern Ireland after its customers raised concerns about the supply of essential goods to the region, as a consequence of the P&O Ferries crisis. Two of P&O’s vessels – the European Highlander and the European Causeway – have not sailed between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland since the ferry operator sacked 800 of its workers without warning last month. The company, which is owned by the Swedish Olsson family, said the suspension of P&O Ferries sailings had come at an awkward time of year when other ferries are out of service for their annual refit. Stena Line has advised customers who were due to sail from Fishguard to Rosslare to travel from the south Wales port of Pembroke instead, as Irish Ferries will accept Stena Line tickets on their vessels. The cancellations have come about as a result of what Stena Line described as “musical ships”. It has moved the Stena Nordica – which usually sails between Holyhead and Dublin – to Northern Ireland, to help provide extra capacity for freight traffic travelling there from Great Britain. As a result the Stena Europe, which usually serves Fishguard and Rosslare, has been moved on to the busier Holyhead-Dublin route, leaving a hole in the schedule. Stena Line’s Simon Palmer said: “Unfortunately we have had to temporarily move the Stena Europe from Fishguard to Holyhead as a result of the P&O crisis, as we had to add an extra vessel for that route to Belfast to ensure continued delivery of essential supplies to the region.” Holidaymakers and HGV drivers have faced several days of delays and disruption, as bad weather and continued suspension of P&O Ferries caused long queues of cross-Channel traffic at Dover over the weekend. Those hoping to avoid port chaos by crossing the Channel by train were thwarted on Monday, when a Eurotunnel Le Shuttle train broke down inside the Channel tunnel. The breakdown came as Eurotunnel said it was experiencing more traffic than it had since 2019, at the beginning of the first school holidays since the UK scrapped Covid travel restrictions. Airline passengers have also faced Easter holiday disruption, as staffing shortages related to soaring coronavirus cases led to widespread flight cancellations. More than 1,000 UK flights have been cancelled in recent days by airlines including easyJet and British Airways because of high levels of crew sickness. The lifting of Covid travel restrictions has prompted a surge in demand for foreign travel, but this comes at a time when Covid-related absences are exacerbating existing staff shortages, after many aviation workers were laid off during the pandemic.",News/UK news,Travel disruption as Stena Line moves ships to fill P&O Ferries gaps,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/travel-disruption-as-stena-line-moves-ships-to-fill-po-ferries-gaps
4/5/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy will address the UN security council on Tuesday amid global revulsion at apparently deliberate civilian killings by Russian troops in Ukraine, as the US and EU prepared further sanctions against a defiant Moscow. The Ukrainian president is expected to demand tough economic measures against Russia after a mass grave and the bodies of civilians, some with their hands bound, were discovered in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv. Zelenskiy, who visited Bucha on Monday after officials said the bodies of 410 civilians had been recovered from Kyiv-area towns when Russian troops withdrew, described the killings as war crimes that would be “recognised by the world as genocide”. A deputy Russian foreign minister was quoted as saying intensive talks between Moscow and Kyiv were continuing via video link and Zelenskiy conceded in a TV interview on Tuesday that negotiations with Russia were still the only option. But he said that after the killings, talks were now a “challenge”, adding it was possible he and Putin would not personally hold talks. In an early morning video address, he said Bucha was “only one town” and the number of civilian casualties in others, including Borodyanka 15 miles (25km) west, could be “much higher”. Images of the corpses of what appear to be civilians shot at close range in the streets of Bucha have prompted international condemnation of Moscow, calls for yet harsher sanctions and demands that those responsible be tried for war crimes. Russia has denied responsibility, suggesting the images are fake or the deaths occurred after Russian forces pulled out. However, satellite photographs taken before the withdrawal show bodies in some of the same places they were later found. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, claimed the atrocities were committed by Ukrainian nationalists, adding that Russia would present further “factual evidence” to the security council to that effect on Tuesday. Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian special services of staging civilian killings to spread propaganda in the western media, saying similar “events” had also been “organised by Ukrainian special forces in Sumy, Konotop, and other cities”. Dmitry Medvedev, one of Putin’s closest allies and deputy secretary of Russia’s security council, claimed the killings were “fakes that matured in the cynical imagination of Ukrainian propaganda” and “concocted for vast amounts of money”. The speaker of the Russian parliament’s lower house, Vyacheslav Volodin, alleged Bucha was “a provocation aimed at discrediting Russia”, with “Washington and Brussels the screenwriters and directors and Kyiv are the actors. There are no facts – just lies.” However, Maxar Technologies satellite imagery of one Bucha street from 19 and 21 March appears to show several bodies in exactly the same position as in video footage and photos taken this weekend in the same street. A New York Times analysis of close-ups of Bucha’s Yablonska Street concluded, after comparing them with video footage from 1 and 2 April, that many corpses had been there since at least three weeks ago, when Russian forces were in control of the town. Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, called the images from Bucha “harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide” and said the security council needed “to think about how we deal with that”. Amid growing outrage on Monday, the US president, Joe Biden, called Putin “a war criminal” and demanded “a war crimes trial”. The White House promised fresh sanctions on Moscow would be announced this week. The US and UK have also called for Russia to be suspended from the UN’s human rights council. As Italy and Denmark joined France and Germany in expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will travel to Kyiv to meet Zelenskiy later this week accompanied by Josep Borrell, the bloc’s highest-ranking diplomat, her spokesperson said on Tuesday. France has suggested new measures could target Russian oil and coal exports, although Germany has warned it is too soon to cut off Russian gas. Clément Beaune, France’s Europe minister, said on Tuesday the EU would most likely adopt a new round of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday. Russia supplies about a third of Europe’s gas and officials in several EU countries have urged caution around measures that could touch off a European energy crisis despite Putin’s efforts to energy as a lever to fight back against western sanctions. Zelenskiy said sanctions must be significantly ramped up after the killings in Bucha, adding: “But … did hundreds of our people have to die in agony for some European leaders to finally understand that the Russian state deserves the most severe pressure?” The Ukrainian president also called for additional weapons from western allies, saying more equipment could have saved thousands. “I do not blame you – I blame only the Russian military,” he said. “But you could have helped.” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he had spoken with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, about Bucha, stressing Ukraine would “use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account”. Kuleba also spoke with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Europe’s worst conflict in decades, which began with Russia’s invasion on 24 February, has killed 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates. The UN refugee agency has said more than 4.2 million refugees had fled the country, while the International Organization for Migration said nearly 6.5 million people are internally displaced.",News/World news,Zelenskiy set to demand new Russia sanctions at UN amid Bucha outcry,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/volodymyr-zelenskiy-un-security-council-russia-war-ukraine-bucha
