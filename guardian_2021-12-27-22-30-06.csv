12/27/2021,"Jury deliberations will resume on Monday morning in Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial in federal court in Manhattan.  The trial began in earnest on 29 November. Maxwell, 60, is being tried on six counts for alleged involvement in her ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty. Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender whose associates included Prince Andrew, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking girls. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail, where he was awaiting his own trial, about a month after his arrest. Deliberations in Maxwell’s trial began last Monday, before a break for the Christmas holiday.

12/27/2021,"Worsening shortages of materials and labour combined with planning delays will hamper efforts to increase housebuilding in Britain in the next 12 months, according to an industry report. Planning remains a major barrier to increasing the supply of new homes over the next year, according to a survey conducted by the industry body the Home Builders Federation, the construction finance provider Close Brothers Property Finance and the builders merchant Travis Perkins.  Delays in securing planning permission were cited as a problem by 94% of small- to medium-sized developers. Boris Johnson’s government has pledged to increase housebuilding to 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s to tackle Britain’s chronic housing shortage. The 243,000 homes built last year was the highest number in 30 years, but the report casts doubt on the target being met. More than three-quarters of housebuilders (78%) reported that the supply and cost of materials, such as bricks, timber and cement, pose a huge problem, compared with just 20% this time last year. “In March we were paying £9 a sheet for 9mm oriented strand board [a type of engineered wood], and up until recently we were paying £32 a sheet. Every single product has gone up,” said one firm that took part in the survey. Another said that in order to secure materials in short supply they have to be bought in bulk in advance, using cash that could be used elsewhere in the business. Worker shortages and rising wages were cited by 59% of builders as a major issue, compared with 19% last year. The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a global supply chain crisis that has led to ships being stuck at ports and shortages of goods ranging from cars to bricks. The UK construction industry has grappled with shortages of skilled workers for years due to ageing workforces, but the double shocks of Brexit and Covid have exacerbated these problems. Many firms highlighted the lack of eastern European workers at the lower end of the trades. The labour shortages have resulted in considerable wage inflation, something that smaller firms are less able to absorb than larger builders. An estimated 800,000 people are employed in the UK’s homebuilding industry either directly or indirectly in planning, design and construction of new properties. The report did contain one bit of good news: an increase in the number of apprentices employed by housebuilders. Almost 60% said they employ apprentices in their business, compared with just a third last year. Firms in the north were leading the way, with 88% hiring apprentices, compared to 59% in the Midlands and 52% in southern England. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation said: “SMEs [small and medium enterprises] are literally having to put their businesses on hold whilst local authorities delay the start of construction as their planning departments don’t have adequate capacity to process applications effectively. Allied to concerns on materials and staff, planning delays threatens the demise of even more SME builders.” Many of those surveyed felt that the planning process disadvantaged smaller firms in particular, partly because larger builders have the financial clout to absorb the costs of long and complex planning processes, and because councils make the planning process smoother for large housebuilders, as larger schemes enable local housing targets to be met more easily. Frank Pennal, chief executive of Close Brothers Property Finance, said: “The combined challenge of both labour and material shortages, rising costs and planning delays are a serious risk to the delivery of new homes across the UK. “Developing homes takes months and years and while some of these issues might only be short term, they risk leaving a lasting legacy on the provision of new homes.”",News/Business,Shortages and planning delays hinder UK housebuilding – survey,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/27/housebuilding-uk-survey-shortages-planning-delays
12/27/2021,"Severe staff shortages could undermine the government’s efforts to keep pupils in schools, with headteachers in England saying that they may be forced to send some children home if they cannot muster enough staff. Despite a pledge by Boris Johnson to avoid a repeat of January 2021, when the government insisted schools would remain open only for them to be closed after an abrupt U-turn, school leaders are warning that the rapid spread of the Omicron variant could lead to mass absences for teachers and other members of staff when schools reopen for the new year.  Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC that staff absences had been at “unsustainable” levels at some schools, with up to 25% of staff off in the week leading up to the Christmas break. “We don’t know what next week will look like. We’re not catastrophising that but we are saying we must have a sense of realism around this,” he said. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said it would be “naive” to think Omicron would not have an impact on schools when they reopen. “It does seem as though choppy waters lie ahead and that some form of disruption at the start of next term is looking sadly inevitable.” Barton said he “absolutely agrees” with the government’s guidance allowing schools to restrict attendance only as a last resort, but argued that school leaders would need to make difficult choices if there were widespread staff absences. “The problem is that if you are running a primary school, and you have got 20 staff and seven of them can’t come in next week, and the pool of supply teachers that you would normally call upon – that is, people have got a relationship with your school and therefore will come and step in at the last minute or a supply agency that will charge you money for doing that at a higher rate – that pool is limited,” Barton said. “You will find yourself in a very difficult position of perhaps trying to teach two classes at once in the hall, stuff which will not be good for the quality of education, or you will be in the position of making a decision about whether some year groups should be in school while some aren’t.” Barton said secondary school leaders could be faced with the dilemma of prioritising classroom teaching for year groups taking exams ahead of teaching for others, “because GCSEs and A-levels really need to go ahead if possible this year”. Last week the Department for Education launched a public relations campaign to encourage former teachers in England to sign up with supply agencies, with the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, urging people “to come forward if they are available to temporarily fill absences in schools and colleges in the new year.” The Daily Telegraph reported that DfE sources were unable to confirm how many had actually signed up with agencies so far, but that it was “at least hundreds”.",News/Education,Staff shortages could force schools in England to send some pupils home,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/27/staff-shortages-could-force-schools-in-england-to-send-some-pupils-home-omicron
12/27/2021,"The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is having an unexpected side-effect on the German municipality where scientists first developed it: for the first time in three decades the city of Mainz expects to become debt-free thanks to the tax revenues generated by the company’s global success. Mainz’s decision to use its financial windfall to also slash corporate tax rates in the hope of attracting industry, especially biotech companies, however, is drawing criticism from neighbouring cities and economists.  The city of about 217,000 inhabitants in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, has been carrying a crippling debt burden since the early 90s when authorities took out a loan that grew to €1.3bn (£1.1bn). Over the first year of the pandemic, the Rhine river city’s debt pile accrued a further €30m in interest alone. But the success of BioNTech, whose founders Uğur Şahin and ‎Özlem Türeci worked with the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer for trials and manufacturing of their Comirnaty vaccine in 2020, has transformed Mainz’s fortunes. Instead of an expected 2021 budgetary overspend of €36m, the city senate this winter announced a budget surplus of €1.09bn. With another surplus of €490.8m expected in 2022, Mainz hopes to clear its remaining debt within a year. Owing to German tax secrecy laws, BioNTech has not been officially named as the source of what Mainz’s senate calls the city’s “Cinderella story”. But the handsome wealth of the company that created the first vaccine authorised in the west is no secret. In January-September 2021, BioNTech made €10.3bn in pre-tax profits, of which it paid €3.2bn in tax – though the company has several sites in Germany and has not said to which municipalities the money went. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Mainz’s main gift to the world was the printing press, whose inventor, Johannes Gutenberg, developed a method of printing from movable type in the city in about 1440. Mainz’s mayor, Michael Ebling, said the game-changing development of BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine was of equally outstanding importance. He told the Guardian he wanted to use the tax money to settle his city’s debts, rather than invest in spectacular infrastructure projects. “Christmas may be upon us, but for the city of Mainz now is not the time to draw up long wishlists,” Ebling said. “The tax windfall will certainly make it easier to honour the other achievements that our city has given to the world.” As well as promoting Mainz’s role in the printing revolution, the mayor said he would nourish its reputation as an innovator in football: the Liverpool coach Jürgen Klopp and Chelsea’s Thomas Tuchel first made their names managing the local Bundesliga club Mainz 05. “We can renovate the Gutenberg museum of printing, and our football pitches will remain in such a state that every player can play a clean pass,” he said. Ebling’s biggest plan, however, is to build on the vaccine makers’ success and turn Mainz into a global biotech hub: a 12-hectare (30-acre) plot near BioNTech’s headquarters, the university clinic and the German Cancer Research Centre has been earmarked for development. Over the next 10 years, the city hopes to create 5,000 new jobs, in part by luring companies through much lower corporate tax rates, which German municipalities are able to set themselves on top of the federal corporate tax rate of 3.5%. Mainz plans to cut its corporate tax rate from 440 to 310 percentage points, by far the lowest among German cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants. The senate says the cut is a gift not only to science startups looking for a new home, but to smaller companies that have suffered in the pandemic. A spokesperson denied the reduced tax rate was designed to stop BioNTech relocating to other low-tax regions. But in Wiesbaden, notionally Mainz’s richer brother across the Rhine, local politicians have criticised Mainz as “extremely lacking in solidarity”, while economists predicted the move could trigger a race to the bottom among German cities. “It’s understandable that Mainz has lowered the tax rate, but I would share local politicians’ criticism of the extent to which they are slashing the rate,” said René Geissler, a professor of public management at the Technical University of Applied Sciences in Wildau. “It’s a bit of a bombshell.” “It will create enormous pressure on other cities to follow suit,” he added, questioning whether the plan would necessarily pay dividends. For startups, he said, a low tax rate was often far less important when choosing their headquarters than proximity to research institutions or companies working in the same field, conditions Mainz already offers.",News/World news,Pfizer/BioNTech tax windfall brings Mainz an early Christmas present,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/pfizer-biontech-tax-windfall-brings-mainz-an-early-christmas-present
