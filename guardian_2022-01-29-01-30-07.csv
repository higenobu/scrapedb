1/29/2022,"Tens of thousands of donated books have started to arrive at the new location of a Gaza bookshop that was destroyed by Israeli air strikes last year, and owner Samir Mansour now plans to reopen its doors next month. The two-storey Samir Mansour bookshop, which was reduced to rubble last May, had been founded by the Palestinian Mansour 22 years ago and was a beloved part of the local community. Its destruction during the 11-day conflict, which killed more than 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel, prompted a campaign that raised $250,000 (£187,000) to help rebuild it, plus donations of 150,000 books. The Israeli military has said that the store was not its target, claiming that the building that housed it also contained a Hamas facility for producing weapons and intelligence-gathering.  Mansour is now preparing to reopen as both a bookshop and library, in a new location less than 100 metres from the original site. The new building, which cost $340,000, needed to be gutted and remodelled, and Mansour spent $70,000 of his personal savings building wooden shelves, tiling and installing electrical supplies. All funds generated by the campaign, which was launched by human rights lawyers Mahvish Rukhsana and Clive Stafford Smith, have gone towards the project, with the blockade imposed on Gaza sending costs spiralling. Rukhsana, an American human rights lawyer working at 3DC in London, said that book donations had flooded in from around the UK, as well as from abroad, with the first cargo container of 50,000 books arriving in the Gaza Strip last week. Shipping of the remainingbooks will follow. “I was so happy when I saw the first shipment had arrived … I felt like a reborn phoenix,” said Mansour. “I did not expect all this support. But it was something beyond imagination and something more than wonderful.” “He lost approximately 90,000 books in the bombing and our goal was to collect 100,000,” said Rukhsana. “We were immediately flooded with books and volunteers who wanted to donate time, vans, cargo trucks, money, and lots of books.” A volunteer from Peterborough, Rabea Zia, helped Rukhsana manage 70 regional book drives across the UK; there were 20 book drop-off locations in London alone. “It started in volunteers’ homes. This became a challenge because garages, kitchens and living rooms were fast flooded with books. Some people held drives in restaurants and coffee shops, which also were flooded quickly and had to be cleared regularly,” said Rukhsana. “We made an appeal for vans. Volunteers borrowed cargo vans and began clearing homes. Central storage units were rented to accommodate the growing number of books. Our garage in Ascot was fast filled with about 30,000 books. Another 20,000 came in from Scotland. Another 20,000 from Leicester, Manchester, Croydon. And small publishing houses donated new books.” The lawyer said that any time it started to feel like too much for the volunteers, they would find a solution. “A cargo company approached us via social media and volunteered to put the books on pallets and stack them with forklifts in a warehouse. From there, another wonderful company called Awesome Books volunteered trucks to pick up from storage locations around the country. They sorted by genre and packed into storage containers,” she said. “It was challenging because of the Brexit-related trucking shortage, but everyone worked together patiently. It was amazing to see how a global community came together and wanted to support this project. Over 4,800 donors gave money from around the world to support his fund.” Rukhsana also explained how donors were encouraged to write messages inside the books, leaving their email addresses so that the books’ new owners can get in contact should they wish. The only request Mansour made was for Harry Potter books, because they are so popular with children in Gaza. Many people bought new Harry Potter box sets for the drive, said Rukhsana, with one volunteer selling cupcakes and baked goods for a month to raise money to buy JK Rowling and Roald Dahl book sets. One man from Santa Barbara spent over $300 shipping three boxes of books to the drive, and more books were shipped in from Greece, France, Italy, UAE, various US cities and Singapore. “There were multiple requests to hold book drives internationally. We had to decline drives because we exceeded our target fast,” said Rukhsana. “Volunteers worked until 1am driving and collecting books and then thanked us for the opportunity to be involved in a tangible way.” The name of the store, when it opens on 12 February, will remain the same, Samir Mansour Bookshop. “I think the community will support the idea of the new bookstore, especially as it is close to the same place that was destroyed,” said Mansour. “We are in a very bad economic situation. So we are hoping for the best and we will see what happens in the future.” Rukhsana said that she and the other volunteers were “really proud to see the books now arriving in Gaza to people who are truly in need of literature and escape. “When Israeli war planes bombed this bookshop it was a further attack on the community’s access to knowledge. This campaign was a gesture of solidarity, an attempt to restore dignity and the fundamental right to books,” she said. “The large-scale global outpouring of support was unexpected. Also unexpected was the intense desire so many had to be tangibly involved in making this right.”",Arts/Books,‘More than wonderful’ … Gaza bookshop to reopen after unexpectedly successful global campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/28/gaza-samir-mansour-bookshop-reopening-after-global-campaign
1/29/2022,"Late-night hosts unpacked the official retirement announcement by supreme court justice Stephen Breyer on Thursday, opening up speculation for the 83-year old’s replacement. Joe Biden promised during the 2020 campaign to nominate the first black woman to the court if the opportunity arose, “because he cares deeply about representation and winning Georgia,” said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show.  Biden announces he’ll nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court, and Fox News loses its s**t. pic.twitter.com/stCX9apJfz “Now that’s what it looks like he’s planning to do, but not everyone is happy about that,” he continued, queueing up several clips of furious Fox News hosts, including Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. “There’s a lot to unpack here, but most importantly: being a black woman isn’t the qualification,” Noah said. “Joe Biden is going to pick a black woman is who also qualified. These people act like Biden is just going to show up at the mall and be like, ‘Yo, Shaniqua, come with me!’” “No, she’s going to be qualified,” he added. “And why is that a bad thing? Why not try to make the supreme court a little more representative of the country it represents? I mean, their rulings impact the lives of every person in the country. So it would be nice to have at least once justice on there who’s had to ask the Walgreens guy to unlock the shampoo shelf.” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert mocked ridiculous speculation by Fox News hosts over Biden’s nominee; Laura Ingraham even suggested that the White House might nominate Vice-President Kamala Harris. “It’s a possibility, I think she’s at least on the short list. I think it’s a theory that could be credible,” said former Trump press secretary turned Fox contributor Kayleigh McEnany. “Yes, according to theoretical sources, the name they yanked out of their keister could be credible,” Colbert riffed. “Let me clue you in, Fox News. Joe Biden is not nominating Kamala Harris. It’s a 50-50 Senate and she can’t vote for herself! “And I know what you’re saying: anything is possible,” he continued. “No, it isn’t. There is no possible universe in which this happens. Thanos can snap that glove all he wants, but even the Infinity Stones could not put her on the court.” “Dr Stephen Strange is like, ‘the multiverse contains an infinite number of timelines, but in all of them, you’re an idiot.” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee tore into Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, whose refusal to end the filibuster along with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has cost Democrats the ability to pass crucial voting rights legislation. “Yes, America’s favorite centrist Democrat fun couple Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema heroically protected the filibuster,” Bee deadpanned. “We sort of understand this bullshit from Joe Manchin, a red state senator who calls himself a Democrat the same way Mormon teens call themselves virgins, but Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema is more a mystery.” Sinema was elected as a Democrat in 2018 in a state that is trending blue, but has continually hobbled her own party – she voted against the Build Back Better bill, has worked to uphold the filibuster. “Sinema has basically been a pain in the butt for years,” Bee explained, “like an itchy lace thong you only wear when dating someone new. In a speech defending her refusal to overturn the filibuster, thus allowing Republicans to block the voting rights bill, Sinema said she would “not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country.” “Lady, you are the disease of division infecting our country!” Bee retorted. “By blocking voting rights, Kyrsten Sinema has done irreparable damage to this country,” Bee concluded, “and Kyrsten, I am talking to you now: in two years, you’re going to lose anyway. Why block progress? Be a one term senator who fucking saves democracy instead of someone who craps on Americans while cashing checks from big pharma.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers touched on Biden’s tight-lipped dance in naming a successor to Breyer. “In our dumb system, there was nothing stopping Breyer from just changing his mind and sticking around, and we all just have to nod and pretend that having a forever job this important isn’t totally fucking crazy,” he noted. “I mean, what about an employee review every decade, is that too much to ask? Whoever came up with the idea of lifetime appointments must’ve been,” to quote Biden on a hot mic, a “stupid son of a bitch.” As for GOP opposition to any Biden nominee, citing whatever historical precedent, “there’s no reason to ever take seriously anything these guys say ever again,” said Meyers. “They blocked President Obama’s supreme court nominee eight months before an election, and then rushed to confirm Amy Coney Barrett eight days before an election. “Now they’re saying even when it’s not an election year, they won’t confirm a Democratic nominee. Next, McConnell’s going to claim the constitution says ‘the Senate can’t confirm a nominee when a democrat is president in a month ending in Y when it’s alternate side parking before or after Labor Day in a year when Tom Brady isn’t in the Super Bowl.’”",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah on the US supreme court: ‘Why not try to make it more representative?’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/28/trevor-noah-biden-supreme-court
1/29/2022,"Jair Bolsonaro has sparked disbelief and outrage by insisting he will go ahead with a trip to meet Vladimir Putin in Russia despite the escalating military crisis along the Ukrainian border. Foreign policy experts and rivals questioned the Brazilian presidents’s planned visit after he told supporters he would fly to Moscow in late February to improve trade ties.  “He’s a conservative,”the far-right populist told his supporters of Putin on Thursday. “Oh yeah?” one replied. Bolsonaro’s move, which analysts believe is designed to project the idea that Brazil’s internationally isolated leader still boasts powerful foreign friends, baffled many pundits. “Has Bolsonaro gone mad?” the editor of the political newsletter Meio, Pedro Doria, asked of the “utterly reckless” enterprise. Ricardo Rangel, a columnist for the conservative magazine Veja, urged ministers to resign over “the most insane trip of all”. “Showing support for Putin just as he threatens to wage a war of conquest is unforgivable from the point of view of the US or Europe, our main partners along with China,” he wrote, warning of “a diplomatic nightmare” if an invasion was launched during Bolsonaro’s visit. The conservative politician Heni Ozi Cukier voiced bewilderment over the trip and Bolsonaro’s claim Putin was a man of the right. “Our president hasn’t the slightest clue what’s going on in the world. He hasn’t the slightest clue who Putin is, much less what it means to be a conservative,” he tweeted. Experts say the trip underlines how Bolsonaro, having alienated allies including China, the US and EU, is desperate to find an international partner with clout. “He has progressively isolated himself from Brazil’s key partners. He supported Trump’s candidacy, fell out with Biden … antagonised China. So he starts 2022 with very limited assortment of partnerships,” said Guilherme Casarões, a political scientist from the Getulio Vargas Foundation. Before accepting Putin’s invitation, the only trips in Bolsonaro’s diary were to Poland and Hungary. “It’s almost a joke. The fact that after three years in office Bolsonaro has only managed to hang onto Hungary and Poland as allies, as well as a few Gulf countries, suggests he really hasn’t managed to make much progress with his diplomatic agenda,” Casarões said. The former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who looks likely to defeat Bolsonaro in October elections, has upstaged his rival with a series of high-profile overseas trips designed to repair Brazil’s reputation after three years of foreign policy chaos. Casarões suspects the US and EU will largely ignore Bolsonaro’s Russia trip and are more focused on Lula’s movements, having concluded “that probably Bolsonaro won’t be in the presidency much longer”.",News/World news,Outrage as Bolsonaro confirms Russia trip despite Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/outrage-as-bolsonaro-confirms-russia-trip-despite-ukraine-crisis
1/29/2022,"In its nearly 500-year history, Ye Olde Mitre in Holborn has served beer under 21 monarchs, survived the English civil war and emerged unscathed from the Great Fire of London. But few events have affected the pubs trade quite so profoundly as the Covid-19 pandemic.  Lockdowns choked off trade for months at a time. Even once venues reopened, social distancing restrictions and work-from-home guidance left city centres deserted and ruined the key Christmas period. “We’re a real ale house so people come from far and wide for our beers: regulars, office workers and tourists,” said Judith Norman, the historic pub’s landlady. “Our regulars tried to support us through the pandemic but with working from home we were a lot quieter than normal.” At Fuller’s, the pub chain that owns Ye Olde Mitre, trade was down by as much as 70% at some of the city centre venues that rely heavily on after-work drinkers. Some had to shut their doors temporarily. Now though, as plan B restrictions in England are eased, hope is returning at Ye Olde Mitre and elsewhere. Familiar faces are gradually resurfacing, dropping in for a pint after the odd office day here and there. “They’re easing themselves back in and we’re hoping they’ll return full time next week,” Norman said. The Fuller’s chief executive, Simon Emeny, thinks this weekend is building to a Monday “trigger point” for revival, with easing of plan B coinciding with the period just after payday and the end of Dry January, which came at the worst possible time. “I detect a growing desire for people to put Covid behind them and start behaving as they used to,” he said. “You’ll see an escalation next week and I suspect that normality will build back faster and stronger than it did in the autumn.” Bookings have been strong, he said, echoing a recent statement from the nationwide bar chain Revolution, which said events and parties booked for December are being rescheduled. “I feel really excited about February and beyond,” Emeny said. “The first step is to get back to where we were in October, then 2019 levels and we’ll see where it goes from there.” The early signs are encouraging. n December, with Omicron concern at its peak, pub sales were 12% lower than pre-pandemic levels, according to industry analysts CGA. The decline was an even more sobering 23% within the M25, with London particularly hard hit by work-from-home guidance. But by the third week of January, the deficit had eased to 11%. Diageo, which makes Guinness and Johnnie Walker, has seen the same patterns in the more than 180 countries where it stocks the bar. “What we see around the world is that as restrictions ease consumers are really waiting to get outside the home to socialise,” the Diageo chief executive, Ivan Menezes, said. The company is expecting trade to reach up to 90% of pre-Covid levels imminently. Help is also at hand from Wales, where nightclubs have been allowed to reopen from Friday and social distancing rules have been relaxed. But most leading lights of the hospitality industry are cautious, particularly given how much debt many are nursing as a lasting legacy of the pandemic. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the trade body UKHospitality, warned the chancellor, Rishi Suna,k not to be complacent about the health of the sector. “The hope is that the return to eating and drinking out will happen quicker than in previous lockdowns, when it took six to eight weeks for recovery to come through. “But that shows it’s going to be a long haul, not an immediate bounce back.” The best thing the government could do, she says, is to defer plans, scheduled for March, to bring the rate of VAT on hospitality from its temporary rate of 12.5% back to 20%. The rise, she said, would “make a bad situation worse”.

1/29/2022,"A US federal judge has blocked a highly controversial sale of oil and gas drilling leases across 80m acres of the Gulf of Mexico, ruling that Joe Biden’s administration did not properly consider the leases’ impact upon the climate crisis. The decision, handed down by the DC court late on Thursday, represents a landmark victory for environmental groups that had sued the government to prevent what was the largest ever auction of oil and gas leases in the gulf’s history.  “I’m thrilled the court saw through the Biden administration’s horribly reckless decision to hold the largest oil lease sale in US history without carefully studying the risks,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “New oil leases are fundamentally incompatible with addressing the climate emergency, and they’ll cause more oil spills and harm to wildlife and people in the gulf.” Rudolph Contreras, a US district court judge for the District of Columbia, was critical of federal government agencies for their environmental analyses that led to the lease sale, writing that they were guilty of a “serious failing” and a “grave error”. He ordered that the new leases be vacated and for the department of interior to conduct a new analysis that accounts for the planet-heating gases that would result if the drilling went ahead. The lease sale was held in November, just days after UN climate talks in Scotland in which the president vowed the US would “lead by example” in tackling the climate crisis. Biden had previously promised to shut down all new oil and gas drilling to curb emissions of planet-heating gases. The administration had claimed that it was compelled to hold the sale due to a successful legal challenge by a dozen states to lift a blanket pause Biden had placed on new drilling projects on federal land and waters. The Gulf of Mexico auction eventually resulted in 1.7m acres sold off to oil firms including Exxon, Chevron and BP, the company responsible for the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. A previous Department of Justice memo, however, showed that the federal government did not believe it was obligated to hold the sale and climate activists have said the episode shows Biden is not sufficiently committed to averting the climate crisis. The International Energy Agency has said that there can be no new major fossil fuel projects if the world is to avoid disastrous global heating. Even some of Biden’s allies have been sharply critical of the lease sale, with three Congressional Democrats filing a court brief in support of the environment groups. “These leases were a climate disaster waiting to happen,” said Raul Grijalva, one of the three lawmakers and chair of the House natural resources committee. “This decision is a welcome chance to reset our federal fossil fuel leasing policies and limit carbon emissions while there is still time to prevent the most disastrous outcomes of climate change.” A spokeswoman for the interior department said the government will review the judge’s decision, adding that “long overdue programmatic reforms” needed to be made in the management of oil and gas drilling across public lands and waters. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobby group, said the decision was “disappointing” and that it will review its legal options. Contreras’ ruling found that the government had relied upon an outdated and flawed environmental assessment from the Trump administration that claimed that greenhouse gases would actually increase if the lease sale did not go ahead, due to a reliance on foreign oil and gas supplies. The interior department had “acted arbitrarily and capriciously in excluding foreign consumption from their greenhouse gas emissions” contrary to requirements under the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, Contreras wrote. Environmental groups involved in the case called on Biden to now halt all future drilling. “The Biden administration’s failure to adequately evaluate the climate impacts of this massive lease sale wasn’t just out of step with their stated commitment to climate action, it was also illegal,” said Devorah Ancel, senior attorney at the Sierra Club. “We are glad that the court has held them accountable for this reckless action, and we will continue to fight to protect Gulf coast communities from the dangers of offshore drilling and climate chaos.”",News/US news, US judge blocks sale of Gulf of Mexico drilling leases over climate concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/28/gulf-of-mexico-oil-gas-drilling-leases-judge-blocks-climate-biden
1/29/2022,"The death of an 85-year-old man who reportedly succumbed to hypothermia after falling and spending nine hours sprawled and ignored on a bitterly cold street in central Paris has prompted grief, anger and incredulity in France and beyond. René Robert, a Swiss photographer known for his shots of some of Spain’s most famous flamenco stars, died last week after slipping while on one of his nightly walks around the busy Paris neighbourhood where he lived.  According to his friend the journalist Michel Mompontet, Robert fell over on Rue de Turbigo, between the Place de la République and Les Halles. “He suffered a dizzy spell and fell,” Mompontet said in a series of tweets. “Unable to get up, he lay rooted to the spot in the cold for nine hours until a homeless person called the emergency services. Too late. He had hypothermia and couldn’t cling on to life. “Over the course of those nine hours no passerby stopped to check why this man was lying on the pavement. Not one.” Mompontet, who also recounted the circumstances of his friend’s death on France TV Info, said Robert had been “killed by indifference”, adding: “If this awful death could serve some purpose, it would be this: when a human is lying on the pavement, we should check on them – no matter how busy we may be. Let’s just stop for a second.” Mompontet pointed out that many people – himself included – often looked the other way when it came to people on the street. “Before giving any lessons or accusing anyone, I need to deal with a little question that makes me feel uneasy,” the journalist told France TV Info. “Am I 100% sure that I would have stopped had I been confronted with that scene – a man on the ground? Have I never turned away from a homeless person lying in a doorway?” The death, which occurred in an area of Paris where many homeless people sleep rough, has sparked a debate about civic responsibility and basic human decency. A headline in Le Figaro read: “The photographer René Robert, dead in the indifference of the middle of the street.” The Spanish embassy in the Netherlands tweeted: “The death of René Robert, who immortalised with his camera all the great artists of flamenco, challenges our collective conscience.” Robert, who photographed flamenco legends including Camarón de la Isla and Paco de Lucía, was remembered by another of his more recent subjects. “Very sad at the loss of René Robert, who I was lucky enough to meet and be photographed by,” said the Grammy-winning flamenco singer Arcángel. “I can’t understand why no one helped him; I don’t want to think that we live in a society with so few values.” The Olivar Association, which has worked with young homeless people in Madrid for more than 30 years, said it was saddened but not surprised. “A lot of people are talking about the awful story of René Robert,” it said in a tweet. “But the reality is that this is the cruel, day-to-day experience of those who live and die on the street. What is happening to us as a society that something like this can happen?” According to homeless associations, 600 people die on the streets of France every year.",News/World news,‘Killed by indifference’: France shocked by death on busy Paris street,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/swiss-photographer-rene-robert-killed-indifference-france-shocked-hypothermia-death-busy-paris-street

1/29/2022,"A billionaire Republican donor and Trump supporter donated the maximum allowed amount to Joe Manchin after the West Virginia Democrat sank Joe Biden’s signature domestic spending plan. The Build Back Better plan sought to boost health and social care, and to help combat the climate crisis, at a price tag of $1.75tn.  Manchin, one of two key swing votes in the 50-50 Senate, used a Fox News Sunday interview in December to say he was finally a “no” on the legislation. The move appeared to surprise Biden, and enraged progressives, but Ken Langone was presumably delighted. The co-founder of Home Depot and author of a 2018 book called I Love Capitalism! had signaled his support for Manchin before the senator made his move on Build Back Better. “I don’t see leadership any place in this country. Thank God for Joe Manchin,” Langone told CNBC in November. “I’m going to have one of the biggest fundraisers I’ve ever had for him. He’s special. He’s precious. He’s a great American.” Manchin voted for Biden’s earlier Covid relief and stimulus package, as well as for a bipartisan infrastructure bill, but helped to water down both. In December, shortly after Manchin torpedoed Biden’s flagship legislation, Langone and his wife each gave $5,000 to Manchin’s Country Roads political action committee, CNBC reported. The amount is the most any individual can give in a year. CNBC also listed donations from major corporations that saw Country Roads raise more than $150,000 more in December than it did in November. Manchin is next up for re-election in 2024. As the only Democrat in major office in West Virginia, he holds outsized power in the evenly divided Senate – a position that would change if Republicans take back the chamber in November. Langone has contributed to Democrats but predominantly supports Republicans. He backed Trump in 2016, and continued to support him while in the White House, though he chided him over the Capitol riot. CNBC reported that Langone has recently made much larger donations than to Manchin, including $1m to a fund that works to defeat Democratic senators and half a million dollars to Americans for Prosperity Action, a group backed by the hard-right Koch family. In his book I Love Capitalism!, Langone writes of his fear of socialism in the US, a fear stoked by the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders’s run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Some young Americans, Langone says, think the US “should be headed toward something that, in my mind, resembles socialism: guaranteed income. Free college tuition. Single-payer healthcare. “I disagree. Strongly.” He also writes that he disagrees “not (as you might believe) because I’m a rich guy trying to hold on to my money. I disagree because socialism is based on the false notion that we should all be exactly equal in every single way.” Neither Langone nor Manchin immediately responded to requests for comment.",News/US news,Billionaire Republican backer donates to Manchin after he killed key Biden bill,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/28/joe-manchin-republican-donor-donation

Few can be ruled out with any confidence, but Debece (3.20) is arguably the best-handicapped horse in the race and could be worth backing at around 8-1 on his second start for Dan Skelton.  The 11-year-old has clearly been a tricky horse to train and will be making only his eighth start over fences but he is on a very fair mark on his best form and his two chase wins to date were both recorded on good ground. Debece has been a late scratch from two subsequent engagements after a strong second at Sandown last March, but he has had a wind operation in the interim and Skelton is well-versed in getting them ready first time up.

On balance, it could pay to forgive Coole Cody’s disappointing effort on New Year’s Day and hope for a return to his familiar front-running exuberance over this track and trip. Doncaster 2.10: Anna Bunina could offer some value getting 6lb from a likely odds-on shot in Miranda. John McConnell’s mare should improve for her comeback run at Musselburgh earlier this month and her five-length eighth on good ground in the County Hurdle last March suggests she should be a point or two shorter in the betting today. Cheltenham 2.30: Chantry House did not travel a yard when favourite for the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day and makes no appeal at short odds. Simply The Betts, on the other hand, arrives on the back of a career-best at this track last time – his first start with Harry Cobden in the plate – and he has often shaped as though this trip will be within reach. Doncaster 2.45: Coolbane Boy showed significant improvement on his second start for Sandy Thomson earlier this month and looks overpriced at around 5-1 for this step up to Graded company.

1/29/2022,"It sounds counter-intuitive on the face of it, but failing to sign all of your targets during the transfer window need not be a bad thing. Take Manchester City, for example, who are currently shoo-ins for the Premier League having already scored 55 goals, yet if they’d got what they wanted last summer, would now be lumbered up front with a slow, sour-faced, superannuated crosstown legend getting in the way of all the kids, and, even worse, five-goal spent force Harry Kane. Conversely, successfully getting your own way can end up backfiring. Yes, it’s Spurs and Harry Kane again, isn’t it.  That we’re specifically setting this up to make Tottenham fans feel a little less down today speaks volumes, but this is where everyone is at the minute, so let’s try to make the best of it.

This unfortunate state of affairs has plunged the fanbase into a deep funk, while sending Antonio Conte’s lid hovering in mid-air on a constant jet of steam, as if constantly daydreaming about what they’d have done with all that £125m cash-in bounty for Kane, and where they’d be right now, wasn’t distressing enough. But if champions-elect City’s positive reaction to marketplace misery is anything to go by, this needn’t ruin Tottenham’s season. That’s why The Fiver confidently predicts a similarly staunch response from Spurs, maybe a fifth- or sixth- or seventh-place finish. Well, it’s all relative. After all, Son Heung-min is world-class, Lucas Moura is fun to watch, and Ryan Sessegnon has to come good at some point. Harry may chip in with a couple more goals too, if he starts getting away again with those egregious shoves and exaggerated spills. So there’s no need for Spurs fans to be chasing Daniel Levy down the Seven Sisters Road waving pitchforks quite yet. Save all your protesting energy for the summer, just on the off-chance Conte abruptly ups sticks in high dudgeon, which, well, y’know. “I’m addicted. I’ve built Wembley and Old Trafford. When you’re doing Lego your mind’s taken off everything else, it’s the only thing that matters and, by the time you finish, you can’t believe two or three hours have just gone. It stops me thinking about football all the time” – Leicester City’s Jess Sigworth gets her chat on with Louise Taylor and, among other things, reveals she can build it like Beckham.

1/29/2022,"Audrey Hepburn, Amy Winehouse and Eartha Kitt are all icons, known for their distinctive eye makeup. Now Julia Fox has joined their ranks. The actor, model, and partner of Kanye West was photographed at fashion shows in Paris this week wearing an extreme take on eyeliner – with the “wing” of the black makeup extending far beyond her browbone. Strong eyeliner was also seen all over the haute couture catwalk at Chanel and Schiaparelli this week.  Jacqueline Kilikita, senior beauty editor of Refinery29, sees Fox’s look as part of a wider shift in makeup towards creative experimentation, with eyes the focus. This is down to a few factors, she says. “TikTok is behind a lot of the bold liner trends out there right now, thanks to experimental makeup artists. Wearing masks more also means it’s all about the eyes.” “We’ve endured two years’ worth of on-again off-again lockdowns thanks to the pandemic, and during that time makeup was sidelined in favour of skincare,” says Annie Vischer, the beauty editor of Grazia. “Now our social lives are back on the table many are craving a change-up.” Television has played its part. Vischer points to Euphoria, where experimental eye makeup is a signature of the character Jules. There’s also the upcoming Pam & Tommy, a miniseries about the Baywatch star and eyeliner icon Pamela Anderson, played by Lily James, and the musician Tommy Lee. These shows are, says Vischer, “romanticised 90s and 00s beauty trends. The inspiration is there for the taking.” Whether or not this extreme eyeliner experimentation will have an impacy on the average makeup look remains to be seen.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Bold eyeliner look takes Paris haute couture shows by storm,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/28/bold-eyeliner-look-takes-paris-haute-couture-week-by-storm
1/29/2022,"In this new series we’ll be asking authors, Guardian writers and readers to sharewhat they’ve been reading recently. This month, recommendations include a damning biography of Robert Maxwell, a mind-bending mystery novel and a delicious history of spaghetti with tomato sauce. Tell us what you’ve been reading in the comments.  One of the nicest things I find about going through a non-fiction spell is that a great book naturally leads me into its related territories, and the books I find there push me onward again. I can see with hindsight the widening concentric circles of my reading all making sense of one another in a comforting way, a way that makes the world seem like something a person could figure out and touch the sides of if they really tried. At the beginning of the year I happened across a 2004 Guardian article by the older sister of the writer Lucy Grealy, who died in 2002. It was critical of a memoir by Ann Patchett named Truth and Beauty which recounted Patchett’s friendship with Lucy. Intrigued, I went on to first read Grealy’s memoir Autobiography of a Face, a precise, beautifully written account of her childhood cancer and resulting facial disfigurement and multiple plastic surgeries. I then read Patchett’s memoir about their relationship, the proximity of the two texts making me appreciate anew how incomplete any single perspective on a shared relationship is. Reading the brilliant Empire of Pain by Patrick Radden Keefe about the Sackler family and the creation of the opioid crisis in America, led me on to one of his source materials, Pain Killer by Barry Meier. Its publication in 2003 led to Purdue Pharma convincing Meier’s employer the New York Times to remove him from his opioid beat, claiming that the book represented a conflict of interest. I also read Dope Sick by Beth Macy, published in 2018, which comes to the epidemic in a much more advanced stage, following a devastating array of outcomes that could scarcely have been imagined a few decades ago. In fiction this month I binged Maeve Binchy, who died 10 years ago. I reread Tara Road, whose punishingly rendered romantic betrayal left me winded in a way it did not when I first thumbed through as a teenager, and then read four more in the space of two weeks, and now I’m not sure I’ll ever really enjoy another non-Binchy novel again in my life. My standout of January, though, was the rightly lauded Fall: The Mystery of Robert Maxwell by John Preston, which achieved the nigh-on impossible by exposing the psychic wounds that lay beneath Maxwell’s deranged personal behaviour and wicked professional conduct, without undermining the seriousness of his actions. Acts of Desperation by Megan Nolan is now out in paperback (Vintage £8.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply. January has been a month of hunkering down with a big, big stack of books. As one of the judges for the Costa book awards this year, I have been immersing and re-immersing myself in the five category winners announced earlier in the month – the debut novel by Caleb Azumah Nelson, Open Water; best novel winner Unsettled Ground by Claire Fuller; John Preston’s rollicking biography Fall: The Mystery of Robert Maxwell; The Crossing, Manjeet Mann’s young adult novel in verse; and Hannah Lowe’s The Kids, a collection of sonnets inspired by her experiences teaching in an inner London sixth form. They’re all brilliant, and well worth reading and rereading. Elsewhere, I’ve been taking my mind off England’s shambolic Ashes performance with CLR James’s meditation on cricket, politics and identity, Beyond a Boundary. One of those titles that has been recommended to me often, I felt a little scared it might not live up to its reputation. It does, magnificently so. James’s intellect is present on every page, but never overwhelming. It’s wry, elegant and fierce. It reminded me why the complexities and intricacies of the sport are precisely the things we should savour about it. James acknowledges a debt to Victorian literature including William Makepeace Thackeray, and it’s felt apt that I have been nibbling away at Vanity Fair too, a chapter a day. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to get to it, and I fear I am already having conversations in a more circumlocutious fashion, so glorious is the prose. I’ve got to the Battle of Waterloo and am hoping the smirk gets wiped off George Osborne’s face. Michael Pollan’s Food Rules is a quick snack of a book, but it’s punchy enough to have made me start trying to eat less meat. Will I stay the course? Hopefully. But when I tell you that I would travel far for a good ragu, you’ll appreciate why I also devoured Massimo Montanari’s A Short History of Spaghetti With Tomato Sauce, an anatomy of a culture on a plate, and delicious with it. I took East of Eden on my first trip back home to Brittany in two years. It had been sitting in my drawer for the same amount of time. I had seen this centennial edition on a charity stall at the university hospital where I work, and got intrigued by its deckle-edge pages. I spent two beautiful weeks with the Trasks and the Hamiltons, who became like close friends I wanted to hear news from every night. Steinbeck writes powerfully of his profound fascination for the Californian land and shares with you his love and understanding for complex humanity. Sam rebelling against an unimaginative world, Lee piercing through prejudices one person at a time, Abra refusing to be crystallised into an impossible ideal. I finished the book on a beach at sunset. It was the perfect setting for a perfect ending. Back in the UK, I am now two thirds into the second volume of Thomas Cromwell’s tribulations, Bring Up the Bodies. I know it is supposed to be as good as Wolf Hall, if not better, but I’ve been finding myself less engaged. Perhaps I have been emotionally drained by East of Eden, or maybe I cannot care as much for Thomas as I did before, now that we no longer see him care for others. He has ascended to power, his wife and daughters are long dead, his proteges grownup. I have been doing an awful lot of “work” reading since coming back after Christmas, and it has in the main been a joy. I raced through the forthcoming new Mhairi McFarlane, Mad About You – she’s my absolute favourite romantic comedy author and this was a January tonic. Then I read Janice Hallett’s second novel The Twyford Code – it’s a mind-bending, code-cracking mystery and it helped get my sluggish brain working again. Whenever I get the chance I’ve also been working my way back through Diana Gabaldon’s Outlander books for a second time, after interviewing her last year; I’m currently on book six, A Breath of Snow and Ashes, and Jamie and Claire are contemplating the imminent revolution. Also on my bedside table right now is Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s The Beautiful Ones, a sort of magical version of Georgette Heyer’s Bridgerton. It’s pretty different to Moreno-Garcia’s excellent Mexican Gothic, a fantasy set in 1950s Mexico, but I’m loving it. And I’m a chapter in to Elizabeth Day’s Magpie – a book I’ve been looking forward to reading for ages.",Arts/Books,What we’re reading: writers and readers on the books they’ve enjoyed in January,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/28/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-theyve-enjoyed-in-january
1/29/2022,"A rapist who was caught on CCTV carrying his victim through Leeds city centre before he attacked her has admitted his guilt nearly seven years after the incident took place. West Yorkshire police released the footage in 2015. It showed a smartly dressed man now known to have been Austin Osayande carrying a woman through deserted streets.  Police said the 24-year-old victim had been walking to get a taxi home at about 5am after a night out with friends. Osayande, 40, was not caught until last September when he was arrested in connection with a separate sexual assault. On Thursday at Leeds crown court, Osayande pleaded guilty to one count of rape and one count of sexual assault by penetration. He was remanded in custody and a sentencing hearing was scheduled for 23 February. Police said at the time that the CCTV footage showed a man, who had the appearance of a doorman, “walking with purpose” around the city centre before approaching the woman. He was described as black, aged 30 to 40, tall and with a shaved head. He was wearing a long black overcoat and black trousers. The then head of crime for Leeds district, Det Supt Pat Twiggs, said: “The footage of the victim being carried off by this man clearly makes for disturbing viewing. We gave very careful consideration to releasing it and secured the consent of the victim who has been left understandably traumatised by what this man did to her. “I think the CCTV gives a really stark illustration of the very serious nature of this offence and we hope it will focus the public’s minds on helping us to identify and trace the man responsible.” Police said the man appeared a number of times on CCTV cameras. One piece of footage showed him loitering in a car park. Another showed him approaching a woman at 4.45am. “The other footage we have released shows this man walking around Leeds city centre and we strongly believe he was looking for someone to attack before he focused on the victim,” said Twiggs. “The way the offender is dressed does give him the appearance of a doorman and we have been making extensive inquiries with licensed premises. However, there could be other reasons why he was dressed smartly like this.” Leeds Live reported that Osayande, of Leeds, previously denied the charges but replied “I’m guilty” to the two charges when they were formally put to him on Thursday.",News/UK news,Man caught on CCTV carrying woman through Leeds admits rape ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/man-caught-on-cctv-carrying-woman-through-leeds-admits-rape
1/29/2022,"Lee Westwood has spoken of a December battle with Covid-19 continuing to impact him as he starts his professional year. Westwood, who is asthmatic, revealed last week in Abu Dhabi was the first time he had walked 18 holes since competing in Houston in mid-November. Westwood is in contention at the Dubai Desert Classic after delivering back-to-back 69s. He is five from the halfway lead, held by Justin Harding. Westwood’s explanation of circumstances renders his performance here especially impressive. “Covid has knocked me back quite a lot,” he said. “It felt like the flu and a chest infection. I’m not very often ill and I hate being ill and it takes a lot to stop me but I didn’t really get off the couch for two weeks in December. It surprised me how bad I was. It’s draining. I don’t feel like I can get as much air into my lungs at the moment. I am glad I was vaccinated.”  Westwood, who will compete in Saudi Arabia next week, shrugged off comments from his former Ryder Cup teammate Colin Montgomerie. The Scot referred to “evil money” in respect of those playing in the Saudi International. “Everybody has got their own opinions,” said Westwood. This issue continues to linger. Paul Casey matched Westwood’s aggregate despite visibly struggling with a neck problem. “I need full physical ability if I want to try and compete against the guys at the top of the leaderboard,” said the defending champion. “So I’m hoping I actually feel better tomorrow.” Harding added a 68 to Thursday’s 65 to earn a two-stroke lead over Tyrrell Hatton. “It would be pretty special to win this tournament,” said Hatton. “I remember when I was at school, waking up early in the morning to start watching it.” Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy’s 66 for a seven-under total means he retains legitimate hopes of what would be a third Desert Classic success. The highlight of McIlroy’s day two was a chip-in eagle at the 13th. “I hit the ball well enough for that score to be a good bit lower,” said McIlroy. “I missed a few opportunities. I certainly hit the ball as well as I’ve done in a long time, it could have been a few better but 66 this afternoon is a good score and sets me up for a nice weekend.” Ian Poulter and Robert MacIntyre were among those to miss the halfway cut.",Sport/Sport,Lee Westwood reveals post-Covid struggles despite strong start in Dubai,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/lee-westwood-reveals-post-covid-struggles-despite-strong-start-in-dubai-golf
1/29/2022,"Brighton are braced for another bid for their central defender Dan Burn from Newcastle before the transfer window’s closure on Monday night. By then Eddie Howe should have added the Lyon midfielder Bruno Guimarães to his squad as well as, potentially, a left-back and a striker, with Arsenal’s Eddie Nketiah high on his list.  Newcastle’s manager has prioritised recruiting at least one centre-half. He believes the 6ft 7in, 29-year-old Burn could help his side avoid relegation and is expected to persuade the St James’ Park board to increase the £8m offer rejected by Brighton this week. Burn, born in Blyth, Northumberland, grew up supporting Newcastle and is believed to be keen on a move to the north-east and a return to the region where he played for Blyth Spartans and Darlington. Coincidentally he has recently been in the best form of his time at Brighton, contributing to some impressive results for Graham Potter’s side. Although Potter would like to keep him, a fee in excess of £10m from a Newcastle board frustrated in their pursuit of Lille’s Sven Botman and Sevilla’s Diego Carlos could alter that stance. Steve Nickson, Newcastle’s head of recruitment, is in Brazil, finalising Guimarães’s £33m switch and Nketiah remains very much on the club’s radar, with the 22-year-old forward much admired by Howe who has been frustrated in a long-running pursuit of Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard. Howe – who has signed the right-back Kieran Trippier and striker Chris Wood this month – has spent the past week at a training camp in Jeddah, where he and his players have met representatives of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the club’s majority owners. Howe’s squad have met PIF officials informally at their Red Sea base and received “a motivational and inspirational” talk from Yasir al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s chairman. “It was a great experience to hear his thoughts on the club and his vision and what the future looks like,” said the manager. “It was a motivational and inspirational talk based on collective aims and collective team spirit. “We were all very impressed with what was said and the players left very enthused. A lot of people from the PIF have been here as well so it’s been a very good experience to bring everyone closer together.” Asked about criticism of the trip to a country with a dismal human rights record where women frequently find themselves segregated, Howe maintained he was focusing on football. “I’m doing it from a football perspective to try and stimulate the players mentally in a new environment and to forge unity,” he said. “It’s a footballing trip. “It’s been really good and the weather’s been really good. The lads had an afternoon on the sand with the local people and we’ve been go-karting, doing a lot of other sports and we attended a Saudi v Oman World Cup qualifier with some staff and players. But training’s been the priority.”",Sport/Football,Newcastle target Dan Burn and Eddie Nketiah in transfer push,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/newcastle-target-dan-burn-brighton-and-eddie-nketiah-arsenal-in-transfer-push
1/29/2022,"A new exhibition of portraits of Tudor monarchs highlights the continuing relevance of the issues that defined the 16th century, including relations with Europe, religious conflict and the birth of empire, according to its host museum. The paintings of the five Tudor monarchs and their key advisers tell a story of the “beginning of modern Britain, Britain in the world,” said Chris Stephens, the director of the Holburne Museum in Bath. “And what we’re seeing now perhaps is the beginning of postmodern Britain.”  The vivid likenesses are some of the most instantly recognisable images in British portrait painting, with many schoolchildren readily able to identify Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. It is the first time some of the paintings have been seen outside London. The portraits in The Tudors: Passion, Power and Politics, which opened on Friday, are organised thematically – dynasty, religion, queenship, conflict and empire – and hung on a regal purple background. “This was one of the most compelling periods of British history,” said Stephen. “And so many of the issues that define the 16th century are still with us. It’s the era of the birth of empire and it’s only now that we’re really engaging with what that means and how we interpret its legacy. “Similarly, the tensions with Europe, fraught relationships and alliances between Britain, France, Spain, the Low Countries, but also the continuities. You can see how some of those marital alliances that the monarchs are negotiating are all around continental European relationships. Britain isn’t and never was isolated. “Again, the tensions between Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots, and the beginning of the process towards the union of England and Scotland – which is also under stress today.” Alongside Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I, who ruled from 1485 until 1603, are some of the most significant figures of the era: Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, William Cecil, Thomas Cranmer, Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell. Many of the artists who painted the images in the exhibition were unknown but showed “extraordinary craftsmanship”, said Stephen. Royal portraiture flourished under Henry VII, said Monserrat Pis Marcos, a curator at the museum. “The turmoil caused by the Reformation resulted in an increased demand for paintings of the monarch, so his portraits were copied and circulated in an unprecedented manner. Elizabeth I and those closest to her also realised the power of portraiture to convey different messages.” Portraits also played an important part in marriage negotiations. “Basically, the fate of an entire dynasty could be sealed by one bad portrait,” said Pis Marcos. According to Stephens, the powerful images of Tudor figures created hundreds of years ago partly explain the enduring fascination with the era – as evidenced by the popularity of television dramas and documentaries, and the success of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy. The exhibition, in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery in London, currently closed for redevelopment, and National Museums Liverpool, runs until 8 May.",Arts/Art and design,‘Beginning of modern Britain’: Tudor portraits go on display in Bath,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/28/beginning-of-modern-britain-iconic-tudor-portraits-go-on-display-in-bath
1/29/2022,"It’s been two months since the first cases of Omicron were identified in the UK. In the weeks after it emerged, modelling scenarios presented to Sage suggested we were facing a situation even worse than last winter, with potentially tens of thousands of hospital admissions and thousands of deaths a day. Thankfully, as we now know, these scenarios did not materialise. The numbers of admissions and deaths peaked below the level expected in even the best-case scenarios. Pressure on hospitals remained very high, but in most cases, the situation was better than feared. The editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, this week described scientists’ response to Omicron as “a case study in error”. He attributed this to an “over-reliance on mathematical modelling and too little emphasis on the experience of health workers on the frontlines of care”, with insufficient attention paid to the views of South African doctors.  “Following the science” in relation to restrictions was always a misnomer, as “the science” was often uncertain, leading to models that inevitably provided a very wide range of scenarios with different levels of restrictions. Many people are now understandably concerned about the potential negative impact of ending plan B restrictions. But again, it is important to look at what’s actually happened to see how effective these restrictions have been – and whether they’ve led to better outcomes. Plan B restrictions have effectively been in place in Wales and Scotland since July (in England, the government announced the move to plan B on 8 December). A comparison of death rates since 19 July from ONS data shows that England has actually had the lowest death rates. (It is not possible to directly compare case and hospitalisation rates due to differences in how they are measured, but these are both closely linked to death rates.) Many have long assumed that more and earlier restrictions lead to better outcomes than voluntary behaviour changes. This assumption is largely based on evidence from the pre-vaccination era, when the countries that locked down quickly against Covid experienced far fewer deaths and hospitalisations. But over the last few months, the real-world evidence no longer appears to support this assumption: now, the main determinant of hospitalisation and death rates is the level of immunity in a population, through both vaccination and natural infection. This is especially the case among older and higher-risk groups. This is why England – where 98% of over 15s have some immunity to Covid-19 – appears to have fared relatively well since July compared with other European countries, despite having fewer restrictions. Behaviour change and compliance to rules also play a role, of course. There is evidence that household mixing in England rose and fell along with perceptions of risk rather than necessarily because of the rules in place at the time. And we have now seen that it is voluntary behaviour changes over the last few weeks, such as reducing contacts, that has led to the same reduction in admissions and deaths that the models showed would be produced by a return to step 1 of the roadmap. At the other extreme, lockdown sceptics now say that because lockdowns and other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing are no longer needed, they were never needed – even though before the vaccine programme, Covid-19 overwhelmed the NHS and the health service was not able to provide all of its services. Even during this wave, the pressure on the NHS remains very high – particularly due to staff absence – and many of my colleagues on the frontline are physically and mentally exhausted. That is why it’s so important for everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance – including wearing masks – even after mandatory restrictions end. Medical and public health interventions are usually judged by the criteria: do they have a clinically significant benefit? Does that benefit outweigh any harms? And are they the best use of resources – or would spending money on something else produce greater benefits? Of course, during the first wave this evidence was lacking – which is why lockdown measures were justified. Even in the second wave, there was sufficient evidence to show that the benefits of lockdown outweighed the costs – especially with the arrival of vaccines, when lockdowns were not just delaying admissions and deaths but actually preventing them. Vaccines have since transformed the situation. The cost-benefit equation has changed, and the benefits of lockdown restrictions do not outweigh the harms. It’s important to remind ourselves of we are trying to achieve – not just a reduction in harms from Covid, but also from the measures used to control it. This is best measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), not deaths – a measurement that takes into account disability too, and has been used in the most comprehensive analyses of the impact of Covid and restrictions. The key is to implement restrictions that have the most favourable cost-benefit and are most acceptable to the public to ensure these benefits are actually realised. So it makes sense to now focus on interventions that cause the least harm and that people are most likely to comply with. The use of lateral flow tests is one example; so is improved ventilation in schools and workplaces. Of course we must not ignore the needs and concerns of those who are most vulnerable to Covid, including those with long Covid and especially people for whom vaccines don’t provide good protection. Fortunately there are things clinically vulnerable patients can do to protect themselves – including wearing well-fitted FFP2 or FFP3 masks, which have been shown in hospitals to greatly reduce the risk of infection. The arrival of antiviral drugs will also provide additional protection from hospital admission and death. We need to establish the effectiveness of any potentially harmful restrictions before they are brought in again, and ensure their benefits outweigh the harms. Most importantly, although restrictions are ending, Covid is far from over. With our new freedoms we all have the responsibility to continue to protect others and be considerate of those who are more vulnerable to the virus.

1/29/2022,"The head of hospitals in Paris has raised the question of whether Covid patients who have refused to be vaccinated should be charged for emergency treatment if they become seriously ill with the virus. Martin Hirsch said the door to hospital treatment was open to all people but questioned whether this had to go hand in hand with “responsibility, allowing everyone to benefit,” in what he said was a “delicate debate”.  “When a free prevention tool is available, can be used, is recognised as something useful by the scientific community, and you refuse it, do you do so without suffering any consequences? Or do we say we will treat you, but there is no reason why you should have no consequences when there will be for other patients who are having difficulty getting treatment and can do nothing about it,” Hirsch told the television programme C à vous. His comments have provoked outrage and calls for his resignation, including from a number of candidates in the April presidential election. The Socialist party’s Anne Hidalgo said making the vaccine-hesitant pay for treatment was not the answer. “We have a strategy and we have to keep on educating people,” she said. Danièle Obono of the hard-left La France Insoumise (LFI), was among those calling for Hirsch to resign, saying vaccinated and unvaccinated people had each contributed financially to pay for the health system. Julien Aubert, an MP for the mainstream-right Les Républicains, accused Hirsch of “mixing politics with administrative functions”. About 30,000 people are being treated for Covid in hospitals in France. Non-vaccinated Covid patients are reported to represent 70% of patients in intensive care in Paris and Bordeaux and more than 90% in Marseille and Nice, according to doctors. One day in intensive care is estimated to cost the French taxpayer about €4,628 (£3,850), while a vaccine dose costs the state €20 (£16.60). Christopher Prudhomme, of the ambulance service in the Paris banlieue, said Hirsch’s comments were scandalous. “This isn’t his job. Looking for a scapegoat is catastrophic. If we enter the spiral of patient selection, are we to make smokers pay for the lung cancer treatment or punish the obese because they eat too much?”",News/World news,Outrage as Paris hospitals chief raises idea of charging unvaccinated patients,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/outrage-as-paris-hospitals-chief-raises-idea-of-charging-unvaccinated-patients
