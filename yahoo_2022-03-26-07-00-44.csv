3/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Neither Gazprom nor the Kremlin could shed much light Thursday on how they will implement President Vladimir Putin’s surprise announcement that Russia’s massive gas trade with Europe will be shifted into rubles. Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Adviser Chubais Quits Over Ukraine War, Leaves Russia China Plane Crash Update: Debris Found Miles From Main Wreckage Russia Central Banker Wanted Out Over Ukraine, Putin Said No Wall Street Is Scrambling For the Exits in Moscow — and Billions Are at Stake China Jet’s Dive Took It Near Speed of Sound Before Crash That may be the point. “This decision looks at lot like it was mainly for show,” said Oleg Vyugin, a former top Russian Finance Ministry official. “The consequences aren’t completely clear and probably everyone will wind up paying differently, some in rubles, some in euros.” European gas buyers were burning up the phones to Gazprom with questions about how the new approach is supposed to work but the gas giant had no immediate answers. Officials in Germany and Italy -- among the biggest buyers -- warned that the idea would violate existing contracts. A senior Russian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the move as not an economic one but a response to the possible threat that Europe might try to seize Moscow’s export revenues. Another suggested Moscow might be willing to cut off supplies to customers who refused to shift to rubles. Veiled Embargo? But with the European Union discussing expanding sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, possibly to the energy trade, the Kremlin has been looking for what it calls “asymmetric” ways to retaliate, where it thinks Russia may have more leverage. “The decision on payment for Russian exports in rubles apparently amounts to a veiled fuel embargo on Europe,” Fyodor Lukyanov, head of a Kremlin-backed foreign policy think tank, wrote in Telegram. “The ruble option leaves a way out for those who desire, but in the West, that will be seen as a political concession to Putin.” Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak warned in a state television appearance Wednesday that cutting off gas supplies to Europe would be “apocalyptic” for the continent. A Gazprom executive said the company hadn’t initiated the decision and didn’t know how it would be implemented. He added that a mechanism would be found given that the order had come from Putin. Reopening long-term contracts to change their payment terms could trigger complex negotiations on other provisions, as well. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday the government and central bank would have to come up with a mechanism in the week that Putin gave them when he announced the switch at a government meeting Wednesday. He said the move would affect countries Russia has designated as “unfriendly” for their imposition of sanctions, a category covering most of the country’s biggest gas buyers in Europe. Disruption Threat A major German industry group warned Thursday the demand may disrupt deliveries. “There are concrete and serious indications that the gas supply situation is about to deteriorate,” said Kerstin Andreae, BDEW’s chairwoman. “With Putin’s announcement that future gas deliveries will have to be paid for in rubles, an impact on gas deliveries cannot be ruled out.” Sova Capital estimates that pipeline exports to “unfriendly” countries in January amounted to 7.4 billion cubic meters, a volume valued at $6 billion, while total gas exports were 13.8 billion cubic meters, worth $9.5 billion. The impact on shoring up the ruble -- which plunged amid the sanctions last month -- would be limited because Gazprom is already obligated to sell 80% of its foreign-exchange receipts for rubles on the local market, Sova said. “Even if a buyer is willing to pay in rubles, it may prove quite challenging given the sanctions put in place against a number of Russian banks,” Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV, one of the biggest lenders to commodity traders, said in a report on Thursday. Soviet Precedent There was little evidence of preparation for Putin’s order. Energy officials prepared a research note on ruble payments for energy exports earlier this month but it’s not clear if it was submitted to the Kremlin, according to a person familiar with the situation and speaking on condition of anonymity. The report found no notable gas sales for rubles in the past, but cited a few transactions for oil products paid in yuan. Two years ago, Gazprom Export sold at least three spot gas batches for rubles via its electronic platform, according to company statements. The press office for Gazprom’s export arm declined to comment on whether more spot agreements were reached. Still, the deliveries accounted just for a tiny fraction of Gazprom Export’s total 2019 sales to countries outside the former Soviet Union, which reached nearly 199 billion cubic meters. Charging foreign buyers for Russian gas in rubles would mark a partial return to Soviet practices. The USSR supplied its closest allies with natural gas in exchange for so-called transferable rubles, a currency linked to gold. Buyers in Western Europe were traditionally charged in hard currency, or more often agreed to barter deals.

3/26/2022,"Energy industry experts are warning oil prices could double from current levels to $250 per barrel this year amid an ongoing international boycott of Russian energy supplies. There simply aren’t sufficient supply alternatives available outside of Russia, according to Pierre Andurand, who runs Andurand Capital Management and is known as one of the top hedge fund managers in the energy sector. “Wakey, wakey. We are not going back to normal business in a few months,” Andurand said on Wednesday at the FT’s Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne, Switzerland. “I think we’re losing the Russian supply on the European side forever.” The price of Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, rose as high as $139 per barrel after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused the six-largest disruption in oil’s supply since WWII. And despite a subsequent pullback, prices have begun to climb again in the past week, rising nearly 20%. On Thursday, Brent crude was back to trading near $120 a barrel, as renewed fears of a disruption in energy supplies from Russia continue to shake the market. Andurand isn’t the only top commodities expert predicting oil prices will soar to record highs. Doug King, the chairman of RCMA’s Merchant Commodity Fund, said at the FT Commodities Global Summit this week that he also believes oil prices could move as high as $250 a barrel this year. “This is not transitory. This is going to be a crude supply shock,” he said. Oil prices have experienced volatile trading since Russia invaded Ukraine, but things could get far worse if the E.U. decides to follow the U.S. in banning Russian oil imports. The E.U. buys roughly a quarter of its oil and more than 40% of its natural gas from Russia. “Uncertainties about Russian oil inject volatility in oil trading,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at the online bank Swissquote, told Fortune via email. “We see decent positive and negative swings, but the bulls have the upper hand. If Europe decides to walk away from the Russian oil, we will certainly see another leg up in oil prices.” Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to force ""unfriendly"" countries, including the U.S., E.U., U.K., and Japan, to settle energy transactions in rubles, rather than in U.S. dollars or euros, has also added to fears that Russia may be willing to retaliate for sanctions by restricting energy exports. Russian authorities also closed an oil pipeline that carries over 1% of global oil demand on Wednesday, citing storm damage. “If a weather-related ‘accident,’ it is certainly a convenient one from Moscow’s standpoint,” Bob McNally, head of consultancy Rapidan Energy Group, told the Financial Times on Wednesday. Increasing tensions in the global energy market come as U.S. President Joe Biden is set to meet with European leaders on Thursday. “Investors are expecting additional sanctions against Russia, along with a plan to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian energy,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients on Monday. Disruptions in Russian energy exports due to further sanctions will only lead to rising prices, according to Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at the commodity trading firm Trafigura. That could mean devastating effects for developing nations. “Whilst the U.S., western Europe and wealthier countries in the world will be able to afford some of these tax breaks, print some money … poorer nations won’t have the same toolbox,” Luckock said at the summit. “These are going to be the people who suffer first, and these are some of the unintended consequences of the policies that are likely to come.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•yesterday,"‘Wakey, wakey.

Once the bank discovered the issue, it decided to terminate the executives, the people said. The firings were first reported by Bloomberg News on Thursday. “Deutsche Bank thoroughly investigates allegations of possible misconduct comprehensively and without bias,” a spokesperson for the Frankfurt-based bank said in an emailed statement. “We do not condone violations of our code of conduct or company policy and take remedial action as appropriate based on the severity of circumstances.” The bank declined to comment further on the circumstances of the matter. Darsney, Raghunathan, Sun and Gaona didn’t respond to requests for comment. Darsney and Raghunathan were managing directors while Sun was a director and Gaona an associate. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is seeking to improve the bank’s controls after a string of mishaps, including that it recently breached a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice after it was slow in reporting allegations by a whistleblower. Both parties agreed to extend an existing monitorship until February 2023 after the DOJ found Deutsche Bank in violation of the deal. The bank has had to plough additional money into improving controls after criticism from regulators it’s doing too little. (Updates statement from Deutsche Bank in third paragraph.)

3/26/2022,"Historically low rates were nice while they lasted. In another hit to prospective homebuyers, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hit 4.42% this week, up 1.31 percentage points from three months ago, according to Freddie Mac. That's the largest 12-week jump since 1994. It's a dramatic shift from the average 3.22% rate at the beginning of this year, and the record low of 2.65% in January 2021. And rates are likely only going up from here. They were already rising before the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark short-term rate last week for the first time since 2018 to try to slow down inflation. The Fed has signaled there are likely a few more increases in store this year, making affordability concerns even worse. The dramatic rise in rates comes as buyers face soaring home prices and scarce inventory around the country. All of those factors could keep many buyers on the sidelines in the coming months, cooling the red hot housing market of the past few years. Increases have already been pushing up the median monthly mortgage payment, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Median payments in February increased 8.3% compared to January, from $1,526 per month to $1,653. More striking: payments jumped 25.6% compared to a year ago. And in fact, demand is already starting to drop. Last week, mortgage applications fell 8.1%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. It could keep falling if rates keep rising. The past two years have been ""transformative"" in the housing market, according to Zillow: record low interest rates combined with many people's desire for more space and millennials aging into their prime home-buying years created a buying frenzy across the country. That led to intense bidding wars, countless concessions from buyers like waived inspections, and many homes going for well over asking. Few markets were safe, with all 50 of the U.S.'s largest metros recording double-digit year-over-year growth from February 2021 to February 2022, Zillow found. Now, the typical U.S. home is worth $331,533, an eye-popping 32.4% increase from February 2020. In the past year alone, the typical home value rose 20.3%. Buyers who closed on homes throughout 2020 have benefited greatly from the astronomical price-appreciation. In fact, the growth in the typical home value in 2021 was higher than median wages in 25 of 38 major metropolitan areas, according to Zillow. In 11 metros, home price growth soared higher than $100,000, year-over-year. Rising rates could stymie that appreciation, though Zillow anticipates home values will continue to climb for the next few months, through the traditionally busy spring buying season, with year-over-year home price growth rate hitting 22% in May. Still, with interest rates rising, home prices remaining sky-high, and few homes for sale, buyers are starting to lose confidence. That transformative era just might be coming to a close.

3/26/2022,"For investors seeking a clear market signal, the last few weeks have been frustrating at best. So far this year, the main stock indexes are down – the S&P 500 has fallen just over 7%, while the NASDAQ is still in correction territory, with a 12% year-to-date loss. However, the market bounced back starting last week. We saw a week of solid gains that saw stocks make a strong rebound from their low points. The result: for the month of March, the S&P is up 3.9%, while the NASDAQ has gained 3.3%. This kind of volatility among conflicting long- and short-term trends makes it difficult for the average retail investor to make sense of what’s going on. What’s needed is a clear lead that will cut through the market’s signal confusion. One strategy is to follow the insiders. These are the corporate officers who combine and ‘inside’ view of company ops with accountability to shareholders and boards for bringing in profits. They know what’s likely in store for their companies – and they’ll trade company stock on that knowledge. To keep the field level, governmental regulators require them to regularly publish their trading activity. The result is a mine of solid data for investors willing to dig into it. We’ve gotten that digging started, using the TipRanks Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool to look up three stocks that have ‘Strong Buy’ ratings from the Wall Street analysts along with significant ‘informative buys’ from the insiders. Let's take a closer look. Aspen Aerogels (ASPN) First up is Aspen Aerogels, an industrial technology company specializing in aerogel insulation products. Aerogels are a light-weight, high-end, multi-use product, in which liquid-filled pore space has been filled with gas, resulting in a solid with ultra-low density that retains structural strength while showing remarkably low thermal conductivity ratings. Aerogels have found uses in construction, in LNG storage, and in petrochemical refining – and more recently, in the EV battery manufacturing niche. That last is worth a look. EVs – electric vehicles – are clearly a ‘coming thing,’ and they are benefiting from both societal and government pressures for expanded production and use. Aspen’s aerogel technology brings several advantages to battery makers, including a valuable combination of low weight and high energy density, along with passive fire resistance. Looking into Aspen’s financial performance, we find that the company reported strong revenues and weak earnings in its most recent quarterly, for 4Q21. At the top line, Aspen showed $31.5 million revenues, up 36% since the year-ago quarter. This gain did not translate into EPS, which declined from a 23-cent loss one year ago to a 50-cent loss in the recent Q4. The company’s share price didn't seem to react to the EPS loss. Aspen’s stock is up ~43% since the 4Q21 report was released. Some other factors to consider are the company’s overall 21% gain in annual revenue year-over-year, to $121.6 million, and its selection of a location for its second US manufacturing facility. Looking at the insiders, we find that Board member Robert Gervis made the most recent 'informative buy' – and his purchase demands notice. Gervis spent $4.5 million to purchase 135,870 shares in the company. He now holds a stack in Aspen worth over $7.6 million. Gervis is not the only one bullish here. This stock is covered by Eric Stine, 5-star analyst with Craig-Hallum, who believes that the company’s technological application in the EV industry is the key to its growth. “With each passing day, we believe it becomes more obvious that the light-duty passenger vehicle market is going electric, with ASPN a top name for us and critical to the adoption ramp. Despite being deeply engaged with OEMs across the automotive industry, we believe that ASPN still remains a relative unknown to investors and an under-the-radar electrification name but think this will change as 2022 progresses,” Stine explained. Stine rates ASPN shares a Buy, with a $65 price target that suggests room for ~75% growth in the coming months. (To watch Stine’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street finds itself in broad agreement with the bullish view on Aspen; the stock’s 7 recent reviews are all positive, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $37.06 and their $56.43 average price target implies ~52% upside from current levels. (See ASPN stock forecast on TipRanks) Smartsheet (SMAR) Next up is Smartsheet, a cloud-based software firm offering products to enchase workspace management and collaboration – a product line with clear applications and advantages in today’s white-collar office environment. Smartsheet’s platform is available to enterprise customers on the SaaS model, and can handle tasks ranging from content collaboration to resource management to integrations and multiple views to administration. The company counts approximately four-fifths of the Fortune 500 firms in its customer base. While SMAR shares were falling through much of February and March, the stock got a boost on March 15, with the fiscal 4Q22 report. The report showed that the business continues to grow – Smartsheet reported its eighth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The Q4 top line of $157.4 million was up 43% year-over-year. Looking forward, the company guided toward fiscal 1Q23 revenue between $162 million and $162 million, which would represent y/y growth of 38.5%, in line with expectations. Smartsheet is predicting 36.5% revenue growth for 2023 as a whole, with a year-end top line between $750 million and $755 million. Smartsheet has a strongly positive insider sentiment, pushed that way by two sizable recent transactions. Paul Porrini, the Chief Legal Officer Emeritus, spent $309K buying 32,500 shares, while Matthew McIlwain, of the Board of Directors, spent $496K on a total of 10,000 shares. Berenberg analyst Andrew DeGasperi was impressed by Smartsheet’s growth, and it guidance toward continuing that pace. He writes of the company’s prospects: “We believe Smartsheet is a market-leading platform, yet it only has 0.6% of global knowledge workers as users. We believe Excel, the primary work/project management platform, is ill suited to meet the increasing needs of a collaborative workplace environment... Given the nascent market, we believe Smartsheet has a significant opportunity to grow its user base. We believe Smartsheet's high dollar-based net revenue retention ratio, growing customer base, and economics of its platforms will drive demand."" These comments support DeGasperi’s Buy rating on the stock, while his $90 price target implies a one-year upside of ~63%. (To watch DeGasperi’s track record, click here) Tech stocks tend to attract a lot of attention, and Smartsheet is no exception – the stock has 16 share reviews on record, and they include 14 Buys against just 2 Holds to give the company its Strong Buy consensus recommendation. The shares have an average price target of $66.80, indicating room for 21% growth from the current price of $54.99. (See SMAR stock forecast on TipRanks) Kezar Life Sciences (KZR) We’ll wrap up with a clinical-stage bioscience researcher, Kezar Life Sciences. This company is involved in the fields of oncology and immunology, and is developing new treatments for cancers and autoimmune diseases. The company’s pipeline features first-in-class small molecule drug therapies with activity in protein degradation and protein secretion. Kezar’s pipeline features two clinical-stage drug candidates, KZR-261 and zetomipzomib. The first of these has recently advanced from the discover stage and the company has initiated a Phase 1 open-label dose-escalation study. The drug candidate is being studied as a potential treatment for solid tumor cancers. The real excitement for this company comes from the two Phase 2 trials of zetomipzomib. This is an autoimmune drug, under investigation as a treatment for Lupus, among other conditions. The company in December released interim results from its MISSION trial of zetomipzomib, showing that the drug candidate demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits in patients suffering from Lupus nephritis. The patient pool was small, only 5, but 4 patients showed positive results. In addition, the drug continued to show a ‘favorable’ profile for safety and tolerability, extended over 6 months. Top-line data from the MISSION trial expected in 2Q22. Kezar also has the PRESIDIO trial ongoing, investigating zetomipzomib against active dermatomyositis (DM) or polymyositis (PM). The Phase 2 trial is described as a ‘randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trial,’ and has enrolled 24 patients. Topline data from PRESIDIO is also expected in the second quarter of this year. Kezar also shows a recent ‘million +’ insider trade. Franklin Berger, of the company’s Board, made a purchase worth $1.299 million earlier this week. His buy totaled 80,000 shares, and it brought his stake in Kezar up to an impressive $14.28 million. This stock has also attracted the notice of H.C. Wainwright analyst Raghuram Selvaraju, who points out that the multiple upcoming catalysts are a strong inducement for investors. Selvaraju writes, “In our view, positive data for zetomipzomib from both the MISSION and PRESIDIO trials ought to establish Kezar as a triple-threat across SLE/LN, DM and PM and position the compound for advancement into late-stage clinical development. Depending upon the strength of the data, Kezar might also ultimately be considered an attractive potential acquisition target, in our opinion.” These comments are used to back up a Buy rating on the stock, and Selvaraju’s $22 price target indicates potential for ~22% upside this year. (To watch Selvaraju’s track record, click here) Overall, this stock has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 4 positive reviews. The shares are selling for $18.05 and the average price target, at $20.50, suggests ~14% upside from that level.

3/26/2022,"When a loved one passes away, most families hold a funeral to mourn, remember the deceased's life and pay last respects. While these events are a good way to gather family and friends to honor the deceased, funerals can be expensive. So, it's no wonder that many people ask if funeral expenses tax-deductible. The answer depends on who is paying and what kind of estate is left behind. Here's how it works. Consider working with a financial advisor as you make an estate plan or update an estate plan. Basic Considerations Funeral costs vary from region to region and the details of the burial service. According to the National Funeral Directors Association, the average cost of a funeral with a viewing and burial is $7,848. For families that choose cremation, the average drops to $6,971. Because funerals can be a major expense for some families, Social Security and the Department of Veterans Affairs (if eligible based on military service) provide benefits to help defray the costs. The ability to deduct funeral expenses on your tax returns depends on who paid for the funeral expenses. Unfortunately, funeral expenses are not tax-deductible for individual taxpayers. This means that you cannot deduct the cost of a funeral from your individual tax returns. While individuals cannot deduct funeral expenses, eligible estates may be able to claim a deduction if the estate paid these costs. However, if your estate is below the $12,060,000 federal estate tax exemption limit (2022 tax year), you cannot use this deduction. Which Estates Can Deduct Funeral Expenses? If your estate is above the $12,060,000 federal estate tax exemption limit, you'll want to claim eligible deductions to reduce taxes. With estate taxes of 40%, every dollar that you are able to reduce your taxable income equals huge savings. To claim funeral expenses on the estate's tax return, you'll need to complete Schedule J of Form 706. All of the eligible expenses should be itemized to adequately disclose what each expenditure was for. If the estate was reimbursed for any funeral costs, that reimbursement must be deducted from your total tax deduction. This includes payments from Social Security, Veterans Affairs, final expense insurance and other sources. Tax-deductible funeral expenses If you are eligible to deduct funeral expenses on your estate's tax returns, be aware that not all funeral expenses are tax-deductible. The following expenses qualify for a tax deduction for eligible estates, as long as they are reasonable in nature: Embalming or cremation Casket or urn Burial plot and burial (internment) Green burial services Tombstone, gravestone or other grave markers Funeral home facility costs and director fees Funeral service arrangement costs, including floral and catering services Transportation costs for the deceased and immediate family members Minister, rabbi or other religious leader service fees Catering food at the reception Be sure to keep copies of receipts for all expenses. This makes it easier to keep track of the total funeral cost. Plus, you'll need them in case of an audit. Non-deductible funeral expenses Travel expenses for funeral guests Any costs paid by a burial or final expense insurance policy or any other life insurance policy The Bottom Line Funeral expenses can cost thousands of dollars on average. With such a large expense, it is common to wonder if funeral expenses are tax-deductible. Being able to reduce your taxes can minimize the financial impact on your family. While you cannot claim funeral expenses on an individual tax return, you may be able to deduct them from your estate tax return if the size of your estate qualifies. Estate Planning Tips Figuring out how to pay for a funeral and cover other expenses after you've passed away can be a challenge. A financial advisor can help you determine the right amount of life insurance and find the best type of policy for your situation. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now. Rather than relying on your family to pay for funeral expenses, many people choose life insurance. These policies are generally large enough to cover multiple goals. These goals include burial expenses, college for kids or grandkids, paying off the mortgage and eliminating household debt. To determine how much life insurance you need, our life insurance calculator provides a personalized recommendation based on your financial situation and goals.

3/26/2022,"The zeitgeist of Google is angry about compensation. Or should that be the “Googlegeist?” That’s the name of an annual survey, and Google released the results of the latest edition earlier this month. Though it found that an overwhelming majority of employees are satisfied with the company’s mission and values, as of January, just a little over half said they believed their compensation packages are competitive, a number down from last year. As you might expect, compensation was a key topic of discussion at a recent all-hands meeting with company executives, CNBC reports. Via Dory, an internal Google tool the company uses to facilitate dialogue between speakers and attendees during events, employees subjected senior leaders at the search engine giant to a slew of tough questions over pay. Executives including CEO Sundhar Pichai and VP of total rewards (compensation and stock packages) Brett Hill were front and center. “Compensation-related questions showed the biggest decrease from last year, what is your understanding of why that is?” asked one employee. Hill replied: “It’s a very competitive market and you’re probably hearing anecdotal stories of colleagues getting better offers at other companies.” He also noted that employees are likely feeling the effects of inflation or the impact of location changes on their salaries. (Last summer, the company announced that it would alter salaries to reflect local markets for employees who moved or opted to work from home permanently.) “Amazon adjusted base salary cap, Apple reportedly used RSU bonuses,” wrote another employee, who then asked how Google is planning to respond to its corporate peers in terms of compensation in a tight labor market. Hill noted that when considering the 81 companies Google typically competes with for talent, there’s been no trouble with recruitment. “We already compare favorably to these companies. We are able to hire from them,” he said. “We will make changes if and when we need to.” When pushed by another employee about the drop in employee compensation satisfaction, Hill said: “This trend — it is concerning to us and we are keeping a close eye on it.” “We know that our employees have many choices about where they work, so we ensure they are very well compensated,"" said a Google spokesperson in a statement provided to Fortune. ""That’s why we've always provided top of market compensation across salary, equity, leave, and a suite of benefits. Getting employee feedback is important, and we'll continue to ensure we pay competitively everywhere our employees work and help them grow their careers at Google.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•yesterday,"Google execs cornered by employees at all-hands, demanding to know why Amazon and Apple are paying more",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-execs-cornered-employees-hands-205046684.html
3/26/2022,"Coinbase expands staking offerings to include Cardano. The current estimated annual return for ADA staking on Coinbase is around 3.75% APY. The recent price uptrend seen in ADA’s trajectory combines healthy technicals and ecosystem-centric upgrades. Top coins are re-tracing their way upward, with the larger market seemingly back on track to register a much-awaited recovery. Nonetheless, market-centric and ecosystem-based upgrades have acted as catalysts for the favorable price momentum apart from the more significant gains. One of the top show stoppers of this week has been Cardano (ADA) which finally managed to pull its price above the $1 mark after being under the price level for over a month. Positive market news has been key to ADA’s recent price jump, apart from larger market recovery. The publicly-traded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced on March 24 that it would offer staking for ADA, the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain. This move aligns with Coinbase’s plans to continue scaling their staking portfolio in 2022. A blog shared by the exchange highlighted that the current estimated annual return for Cardano staking on Coinbase is around 3.75% APY. Coinbase’s Senior Product Manager Rupmalini Sahu explained the decision by pointing out, “ADA is in the top 10 coins by market capitalization, and it has a flexible, sustainable, and scalable blockchain design. That design uses smart contracts, similar to Ethereum and Solana, to enable decentralized finance, NFTs, and other activities on the network.” Notably, Coinbase has been on quite a listing spree since last year; the exchange also recently added ApeCoin (APE). Coinbase aims to increase its staking options, as Sahu highlights the exchange’s “plans to continue to scale its staking portfolio in 2022.” Notably, ADA joins a list of coins for Coinbase provides staking services, including Algorand, Cosmos, Ethereum, and Tezos.  Cardano’s price has witnessed a significant boost after months of downtrend. A crucial development that fueled a bullish narrative among investors for ADA is Cardano’s network upgrade that increased Plutus’ per block script memory units to 62 million.  Historically, Cardano’s network upgrades have had a bullish impact on altcoin’s price trajectory, fueling demand for ADA across exchanges. At press time, ADA traded at $1.11, noting a 14.66% daily and a 31.69% weekly rise in price.  Cardano’s recent price uptrend combines a technical bounce from oversold levels and a bullish long-term outlook considering the upcoming network upgrades.

3/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian miner Petropavlovsk Plc extended a slump that has wiped out more than 90% of its value this year after warning that U.K. sanctions against its main lender, Gazprombank, mean it is currently unable to sell gold. Most Read from Bloomberg China Plane Crash Update: Search Continues for Second Black Box Putin Adviser Chubais Quits Over Ukraine War, Leaves Russia NATO Boosts Forces in East Amid Chemical Incidents Warning Apple Is Working on a Hardware Subscription Service for iPhones China Crash Mystery Grows as Evidence Signals Midair Breakup Gazprombank, which was added to Britain’s sanctions list on Thursday in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, acts as an off-taker of 100% of the company’s gold production under the conditions of two loans, Petropavlovsk said in a statement Friday. Restrictions on purchasing and selling gold in Russia may make it “challenging” to find an alternative buyer, it also said. The London-listed shares fell as much as 33% to a record low of 1.2 pence. Petropavlovsk has been hit particularly hard by the rout in Russian stocks following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions. A market capitalization of just under a billion pounds ($1.32 billion) only five months ago has since crumbled to about 65 million pounds. The selloff has made the stock one of the cheapest in London, trading at 0.9 times forward earnings -- a big discount to the FTSE 100’s 11.4 times. Petropavlovsk also warned on Friday that sanctions mean it cannot make an interest payment of $560,000 due today under the terms of a $200 million term loan with Gazprombank. It is a condition of that loan and $86.7m in revolving credit facilities that Gazprombank acts as off-taker of all the company’s gold production. “This asset freeze and the complications it introduces to POG’s operation mean the potential longer-term value we can see in the group looks under considerable jeopardy,” Peel Hunt analysts Peter Mallin-Jones and Tim Huff wrote in a note. Petropavlovsk is one of just a few Russian stocks still trading in London after the London Stock Exchange halted trading of Russian depositary receipts earlier this month in order to maintain an orderly market.

3/26/2022,"By Eileen Soreng and Praveen Menon (Reuters) - Russia might look to its giant neighbour to replace Australian alumina supplies cut off by sanctions, but Chinese aluminium smelters need all the feedstock they can get and may be worried about secondary sanctions from the West, industry analysts say. Australia on Sunday imposed an immediate ban on exports to Russia of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The move squeezes Russian aluminium giant Rusal, the world's No.2 producer outside China. It gets about 19% of its alumina from Australia's Queensland Aluminium (QAL), in which it holds a 20% stake. Graphic: Australia's ban on alumina exports to Russia tightens the raw materials screw on Rusal: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/egvbkbnempq/Rusal%20Alumina%20Dependency.PNG While there is no concrete evidence that Russia is seeking Chinese alumina supplies, analysts say close ties, proximity and the size of the Chinese market make it a logical option. China, the top global aluminium producer, is likely to step in and absorb Australian alumina exports that had previously headed to Russia and could then potentially on-sell supplies, said Wood Mackenzie senior manager Uday Patel. ""Chinese firms could buy alumina from QAL and then sell back to Rusal,"" Patel told Reuters. ""(China) could also sell some of its domestic production, but note that alumina demand in China is also increasing this year as Chinese smelters lift output after all the power constraint issues in 2021."" QAL and Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, which owns 80%, did not respond to requests for comment about what would happen to the alumina exports meant for Russia and if they were receiving requests from Chinese companies. Rusal could not be reached for comment but said previously it was evaluating the effects of the Australian move. ANZ analyst Soni Kumari agreed China's domestic demand would constrain what it can do for Russia. ""Russia could turn to China, but the country does not have enough export surplus given their requirement to feed domestic smelters,"" she said. ""Further, Chinese exporters would be cautious too due to fear of secondary sanctions."" Washington has warned China against taking advantage of business opportunities created by sanctions and helping Moscow evade export controls or process its banned financial transactions. Kazakhstan could step up to help offset Russian shortages, Kumari said, while other suppliers could include Brazil, Jamaica and Guinea. 'PARIAH STATE' China has refused to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion. Beijing has also opposed economic sanctions on Russia, which it says are unilateral and are not authorised by the U.N. Security Council. ""Russia is its key ally but at the same time China doesn't want the stigma of being seen as a pariah state for helping Russia,"" said Patel. He said there was talk in the market of some tonnages of alumina booked to be shipped from China to Russia via eastern Russian ports. Reuters could not independently verify any additional alumina shipments or planned shipments to Russia from China. China exported 7,967 tonnes of alumina in the first two months of this year of which 698.6 tonnes went to Russia, according to Chinese customs data. Last year, its alumina exports were at 119,891 tonnes, with 1,822 tonnes going to Russia. The loss of Australian supplies is not the only issue for Rusal, which supplies about 6% of global aluminium. Among Rusal's other major alumina suppliers, the Nikolaev refinery in Ukraine with a capacity of 1.75 million tonnes a year, is out of commission because of the conflict. There are also supply chain issues at Rusal's 2 million tonnes a year Aughinish alumina refinery in Ireland, WoodMac said. European nations and the United States have imposed heavy sanctions on Russia since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on Feb 24 in what it calls a ""special military operation"". The sanctions and ongoing conflict, along with supply constraints caused by the pandemic, have pressured commodities markets and triggered record price hikes. [MET/L] Aluminium is a key metal due to its use across sectors from auto, aerospace, packaging, machinery and construction sectors to production of military equipment and ammunition.

3/26/2022,"(Reuters) -Energy and metals firms led a jump in Russian stocks on Thursday as trading resumed after almost a month's suspension, reflecting soaring global prices for oil, gas and other commodities on fears the Ukraine crisis will threaten supply. The market was also underpinned by a government commitment to support stocks, leading a senior U.S. official to dismiss the limited resumption of trading as a ""a charade: a Potemkin market opening"". Stocks had not traded on Moscow's bourse since Feb. 25, the day after President Vladimir Putin sent troops into neighbouring Ukraine, prompting Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically and then Russian countermeasures. The reaction has cut off Russian financial markets from global networks and sent the rouble currency tumbling. Stocks had also plunged immediately after Moscow launched what it calls ""a special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour. Restrictions on trade with foreigners and a ban on short selling remained in place on Thursday as the Moscow Exchange cautiously resumed equities trading. On Friday, more securities, including corporate bonds and Eurobonds will be traded, the central bank said. ""We will do everything possible to open all segments of the stock market soon,"" Boris Blokhin, head of Moscow Exchange's stock market department, said. STELLAR GAINS The short session saw energy firms make stellar gains, with gas producer Novatek, oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil and gas giant Gazprom up 12%-18.5%. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was trading near $120.6 per barrel on Thursday, having jumped more than 20% from a month ago as worries about supply disruptions from the Ukraine crisis drive up prices. [O/R] Shares in mining giant Nornickel also gained 10.2%. Novatek and Nornickel pared losses sustained since before Feb. 24 by the session's close. Fertiliser producer Phosagro closed at a record high. ""Large bids to buy Russian shares have been seen since the market opening,"" BCS Brokerage said in a note, adding that a promise Russia's rainy-day fund will buy shares was also underpinning the market. ""The overall sentiment is supported by the confidence that the finance ministry will buy stocks,"" BCS said. The government said on March 1 that it would use up to 1 trillion roubles ($10.4 billion) from the National Wealth Fund to buy battered Russian stocks, although it was not clear whether any purchases were being made on Thursday. The finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'POTEMKIN MARKET OPENING' A senior U.S. official said Moscow's commitment to buy amounted to artificially propping up shares, and called the limited resumption ""a Potemkin market opening"". ""This is not a real market and not a sustainable model - which only underscores Russia's isolation from the global financial system,"" deputy White House national security adviser Daleep Singh said in a statement. Trading in Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange remains suspended. Prices of some instruments had plunged to almost zero before the bourse halted trading of them in early March. The Moscow Exchange said 567,000 private investors had accounted for 58.2% of Thursday's trading volume, with 121 professional participants conducting the remainder. ""Today the first step was made in our new reality,"" said Elbek Dalimov, head of equity trading at Aton brokerage, adding that trading orders were limited with non-residents, who hold more than half the free float on the market, sidelined. ""In the morning we saw a huge number of retail investors who on the one hand were closing short positions and on the other were ready to park their roubles in shares, so as to somehow save them from inflation,"" he said. The benchmark MOEX stock index ended the short trading session 4.4% higher at 2,578.51 points, having earlier reached a day peak of 2,761.17. The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 9% on the day to 852.64, pressured by the weaker rouble, according to MOEX data that was suspended in the Eikon terminal. The negative impact of sanctions was clear in some sectors, with shares in Russia's second-largest lender VTB down 5.5%. And with most European airspace closed to Russian planes, flagship carrier Aeroflot sank 16.44%. Trading apps of major brokerages with leading banks, including Sberbank, VTB and Alfa, reported temporary problems with processing clients' orders following the restart. ROUBLE FIRMS The rouble meanwhile extended its recovery, gaining 1.3% to trade at 96.50 against the dollar in Moscow trade by 1502 GMT. The currency had hit its strongest level in three weeks at 94.975 on Wednesday after Putin said Russia would start selling its gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in roubles. Against the euro, the rouble was 2.1% higher at 105.75, pulling further away from an all-time low of 132.4 it hit in Moscow trading earlier in March, but far from levels of around 90 seen before Feb. 24. Russia resumed trading of OFZ treasury bonds on Monday with the central bank helping to stabilise the market with interventions, the amount of which it has not yet disclosed. Yields of benchmark 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to their prices, stood at 13.68% after hitting an all-time high of 19.74% on Monday.

3/26/2022,"Every investor gets into the stock market to find the best returns. That’s been especially true for the past five years or so, as the Federal Reserve held interest rates at historic low levels. While the central bank has started reversing that policy, it will take time for rates to rise appreciably – and so for the near- to mid-term, stocks are likely to remain the best engine for finding returns-on-investment. The key to making the most out of a stock investment, however, is not just the return. Investors need to look at the initial buy-in, too, and to remember the old cliché of ‘buy low and sell high.’ There are plenty of stocks floating around with low costs of entry - $10 per share, or even less – that still have an attractive combination of sound fundamentals, analyst approval, and high upside potential. While the low share price entails some added risk – basic math suggests it can magnify gains, but the reverse is also true – it can be worth it when the return potential comes in at 100% or better. So let’s dip into the TipRanks data and find some low-price stocks that fit this bill. These are equities priced under $10 per share, and Wall Street expects them to double or more in the coming months. Here are details. Rent the Runway (RENT) The first stock we’re looking at is Rent the Runway, an interesting e-commerce firm in the contemporary fashion niche. Rent the Runway makes high-end fashion garments, as well as accessories, jewelry, and handbags, available to the average consumer, for rent instead of purchase. The service includes free shipping and returns, a fast turnaround on orders, cleaning coverage, AI-powered fitting technology, and a several membership choices, allowing users to select from 4 to 16 items each month. Memberships are sold on a monthly subscription basis. This unique company took its idea public last fall, with an IPO on October 27. RENT shares opened at a price of $21, at the top of the expected range, and the company sold 17 million shares, 2 million more than had been expected. The event saw the company raise $357 million gross proceeds. After the IPO, RENT fell steadily before levelling off at the beginning of 2022. The shares saw a slight uptick this month, although the stock is down 70% since it debuted on the markets. RENT has been trading publicly long enough to have released one quarterly financial report. The release, for Q3 of fiscal year 2021 (which ended on October 31) covers the quarter during which the company went public, and makes an interesting snapshot of RENT’s initial conditions as public entity. The company reported 78% year-over-year increase in active subscribers, and a 66% increase in total revenue. The active subscriber total reached 116,833, while the revenue was up to $59 million. RENT reported gross margins of 33.7%, a huge improvement over the 6.8% seen in fiscal 3Q20. In coverage of RENT for Jefferies, analyst Ashley Helgans writes: “We expect outsized growth from RENT, as the company sits at the intersection of multiple secular trends driving consumer behavior: 1) continued shift to ecom; 2) focus on sustainability; 3) access vs. ownership models; 4) desire for newness and variety; and 5) increase of women in the workforce.” Getting into some deeper detail, Helgans adds, “Rent the Runway has ~150K subscribers and over 2.5M lifetime customers. In a recent survey, 56% of women expect they will subscribe to fashion in the next five years. The company defines their current opportunity set at 21M women. Today, subscribers represent 0.7% of the company's defined TAM. On a TTM basis, 400K consumers used Rent the Runway (150K subscribers + 250K nonsubscribers). If 20% of those nonsubscribers convert, this would represent an incremental $90M in revenue.” In line with this bullish outlook, Helgans rates RENT a Buy with a $13 price target that suggests an impressive 117% upside in the coming months. (To watch Helgans’ track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, the analyst community is on the same page. Given that 4 Buys have been issued in the last three months compared to no Holds or Sells, the message is clear: RENT is a Strong Buy. In fact, the average price target is even more upbeat; at 18.75, the figure is expected to yield 12-month returns of 213%. (See RENT stock forecast on TipRanks) Cepton (CPTN) And now let’s turn to a tech company, Cepton. This firm designs and distributes LiDAR systems, the state-of-art, digitally based, laser ranging technology used in applications as varied as satellite mapping and self-driving automobiles. Cepton has patented its Micro Motion Technology, and delivers reliable, scalable LiDAR units capable of delivering long-range, high-resolution 3D perception. Cepton has been at the forefront of pushing LiDAR into applications beyond autonomous vehicles. The company’s units are used in ‘smart cities,’ where they enable road, rail, pedestrian, and traffic analytics. They are also found in the industrial market, with applications in autonomous robots and ground vehicles. The automotive sector gets the headlines, however – Cepton was, in September, selected by GM as a key LiDAR provider for the automaker’s 2023 production line. To raise new capital for its projects, Cepton entered the public markets just last month. On February 9, the company’s proposed SPAC merger with Growth Capital Acquisition Corporation, and the CPTN ticker started trading on February 11, closing that day at $8.23. In its first few days of public trading, the stock spiked to more than $40, before dropping back down; it is now trading for less than half its first day’s close. Cepton’s SPAC merger briefly gave the company a $1.4 billion valuation; it currently has a market cap of $613 million. The company did not raise as much capital as expected from the merger, due to a high-rate of pre-merger stock redemptions, but the transaction did give Cepton as much as $175 million in available liquidity once completed. Craig-Hallum’s 5-star analyst Richard Shannon sees Cepton as a potential winner going forward. In his recent note on the subject, he outlines several reasons, including its versatility and its wider market. “CPTN’s critical IP is in its unique MMT scanning method that has no moving parts and therefore is highly reliable, and a likely reason behind its GM win. While using 905nm edge emitters and APD detectors, CPTN can adapt to other scanning choices should cost/performance/reliability prove attractive over time, a capability we think few other lidar makers have... CPTN is one of a few lidar makers targeting the non-auto market, whereas dozens are going after the auto market. CPTN’s progress here (9 customers/126 engagements/$100M+ pipeline) plus what our checks indicate is industry-leading SW gives us confidence that this can provide a nice bridge to auto sales ramping in C23/24 that others don’t have.” Shannon’s stance on Cepton is a solid Buy, and his $19 price target indicates his confidence in a strong 369% one-year upside to the stock. (To watch Shannon’s track record, click here) This new stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating from Wall Street’s analysts, based on 3 reviews that include 2 Buys and a single Hold. The shares are priced at $4.05, and their $15 average target implies a 270% upside in the next 12 months.

3/26/2022,"Historically, only institutions have been able to be part of REITs (real estate investment trust), which are made up of companies that own or finance income-producing real estate across a range of property sectors. A startup called Flock Homes wants to give landlords a similar ability to own shares of a portfolio that is made up of multiple properties, and it’s just raised a $26 million Series A funding round toward that effort. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led the financing, which also included participation from 1Sharpe Ventures (which is led by Roofstock co-founder and chairman Gregor Watson) and Human Capital as well as existing backers Susa Ventures, Primary Venture Partners and BoxGroup. Founder Ari Rubin dropped out of business school to pursue his concept behind the startup, which went live in May 2021 with four homes in Denver, Colorado. Its typical user is a landlord of single-family homes with one to four units that doesn’t necessarily want to be rid of their investment but also doesn't want to deal with managing it anymore. “Flock buys the property from the landlord, who then gets shares in this partnership which owns a bunch of houses,” Rubin explained to TechCrunch. “They get to keep all the benefits of owning real estate without any of the burdens such as paying taxes or maintenance.” Once the properties come into Flock, the company owns and operates the assets. Meanwhile, the landlords then get shares in a diversified portfolio similar to a REIT, Rubin said. So, someone who owns a $500,000 house can sell it to Flock and get back $500,000 worth of shares in the fund. As the portfolio appreciates in value, so do the shares. “They also get their share of all the rental income, which we collect and hold back a portion for maintenance, property taxes and insurance,” Rubin said. “Then we pay out the remainder in a distribution.” Some people decide to reinvest their proceeds while others opt for cash flow, with the ability to redeem shares over time. “Most people, though, want to hold on to them forever, live off the income and pass them on to heirs,” Rubin said. “So it also can serve as an estate planning tool. But either way, they can put their ownership on autopilot and live off of the diversified income.” The company makes money by acting as an asset manager of the fund and charging management fees, which is 1% of the value of someone’s account. It claims to save the landlord money in taxes and other “frictions” if they had sold the home traditionally. Today, Flock has 110 homes in its portfolio across Denver, Austin,Texas and Kansas City. The company plans to launch in Seattle and “a handful of more markets” this year. “Institutions have been doing this for a long time via a mechanism called a 721 Exchange and it takes an army of lawyers and tax professionals and complicated pieces of paper to make it work. We’re building technology to streamline that process,” Rubin said. “We’re taking something that’s existed for a number of decades and are using technology to make it more accessible to more people.” The company aims to build a standardized portfolio of homes, so it won’t be including a $25 million mansion outside of Palo Alto, for example. It uses third-party valuation models to come up with fair market value of a home.  The way it works is that a landlord submits the information about a house through Flock’s website. The Flock team then uses a proprietary valuation system to derive a headline valuation, and then makes adjustments to the final price based on the amount of repairs and deferred maintenance found in the house. Unlike an iBuyer, Rubin said, the company “never profits” off a house value. “We’re focused on making sure the system is fair and transparent for every owner putting in their house,” he said. But what if homes depreciate in value? Rubin said the aim upfront is to only include homes with greater potential for upside. “We look for homes that will add value to other landlords and owners who have put houses into Flock,” Rubin said. “We have no idea what the market is going to do long term. Maybe it will keep going up and down. But we only take homes that we feel confident we can operate efficiently and provide really good returns to owners and good experiences to the residents who are living there.” Image Credits: Flock Homes Primary Ventures, Susa Ventures and BoxGroup co-led Flock's $6.5 million seed round last March, so this latest financing brings its total equity raised to $32.5 million. With 17 employees, it has dual headquarters in Denver and San Francisco. It plans to use the capital from this raise to continue to build out its technology and toward hiring. The company operates with an asset-light model, Rubin said, in that it doesn’t need cash to buy homes and rather uses money from when people are rolling in their equity from their homes. A16z General Partner Alex Rampell believes that one problem with being a landlord is that it can be very difficult to just retire. “Owning stocks and bonds can provide you with passive income and asset appreciation, but being a landlord means you need to fix toilets, worry about vacancies, find tenants and more,” he said. “The grass is always greener on the other side, except when you are trying to enjoy retirement and literally need to water the grass to find a new tenant.” He was drawn to Flock’s ability to allow any landlord to roll their properties into the portfolio it has created, while still providing the former landlord with the same income stream with no immediate tax consequences. “In the process, it is assembling a powerful machine to aggregate many properties, democratizing investor access and improving resident experiences with technology,” Rampell added.

3/26/2022,"The hot real estate market has made it nearly impossible for even a Federal Reserve governor to find a home. Fed Governor Christopher Waller attributed eye-popping home prices to the convergence of a pandemic-driven spike in demand and low interest rates in a speech on Thursday, adding that the ""crazy"" real estate market has impeded his own search for a new home in Washington D.C.

She offered three reasons for the favorable environment: an initial delay in recognition of the investment opportunity has given the market longevity; the consistent rise of rents nationwide; and the persistence of low interest rates. ""The return on investment is phenomenal, and has been in so many markets in so many cities throughout the U.S.,"" she told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer on Feb. 17. ""It's probably the best market I've ever seen in my life."" During the pandemic, the U.S. housing market boomed amid a surge in demand as COVID-19 shutdowns heightened the importance of people's homes and buyers sought to take advantage of low mortgage rates. A spike in home prices lagged behind COVID-19 shutdowns in the spring of 2020. By November of that year, however, housing prices had increased 9.5% compared to November 2019, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index. The longevity of the strong market owes in part to that initial delay in housing investment, Corcoran suggested. In this episode of Influencers, Andy is joined by The Corcoran Group Founder & ‘Shark Tank’ Star, Barbara Corcoran, as they discuss the country’s hottest real estate markets, Barbara’s ‘Shark Tank’ investing strategy, and why she thinks the metaverse could be ‘the best thing that ever happened to retail’. ""There was a shyness in the market — people were slow to respond to investment in real estate,"" Corcoran says. ""Now everybody's jumping into it, but it kind of lagged behind all other kinds of investments. So you had a little rest period."" Corcoran also cited the nationwide rise in rents as a driver of the hot housing market. In December, the average monthly listed rents in the U.S. increased 14.1% year-over-year to $1,877, which marked the largest annual increase since February 2019, according to Redfin. ""The rents have been going up nationally, and if you choose your properties carefully, like if you're investing say in Orlando, rents are up almost 30% — crazy,"" she says. ""So picture what that does to the bottom line."" When Corcoran describes the housing market as the best of her lifetime, she draws on decades of real estate experience. In 1973, at age 23, Corcoran used a $1,000 loan to launch a real estate firm called the Corcoran Group, which employed seven real estate agents who sold property on the Upper West Side in New York City. Over the ensuing years, the firm built an international presence and a reputation for luxury real estate. Corcoran sold the business in 2001 for $66 million. Low interest rates account for the final reason why Corcoran remains bullish on the housing market. Though Corcoran spoke to Yahoo Finance in mid-February, before rates on the most popular home loan (the 30-year fixed mortgage) surpassed 4% — the highest level since April 2019. ""Very importantly — which we all take for granted like our right to breathe — money is so cheap,"" Corcoran says. ""So you can leverage really high."" Corcoran offered up simple advice: Get into this housing market as quickly as you can. “I've never seen it more tantalizing and with more promise,” she says.
