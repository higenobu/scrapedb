2/21/2022,"I live in rural Derbyshire and have been trying to get broadband installed since July last year. Since placing the order, I have received every excuse in the book from BT as to why my installation cannot go ahead. My near neighbour has a broadband service, but it appears that there is a problem with the pole in the road and it must be replaced. I took another call yesterday to learn that BT has just delayed installation by a further six weeks to March. That will be almost nine months since I placed the order – if it goes ahead. I have a very poor mobile signal which makes doing any work at home very difficult.  The irony is, I have been promised £5.04p a day compensation for BT not connecting me, plus £25 each time it failed to attend. So far, I estimate it owes me over £800, a huge waste of money, which will no doubt end up being paid by other customers. NM, Derbyshire BT was one of the first firms to sign up to the Ofcom compensation scheme in 2019, which was launched to introduce financial disincentives to broadband firms for failing to connect customers. However, it clearly hasn’t worked in your case – £800 is an awful lot of compensation, but then it has been a very long wait. I asked both BT, your supplier, and Openreach, which manages the network on all the telecoms providers’ behalf, for an explanation, and Openreach has now got its act together. It blamed the delays on the fact that the work wasn’t properly flagged internally as a priority. “We’re extremely sorry for the time it’s taken to connect NM’s broadband. Such a lengthy delay is inexcusable but extremely rare. “We’re carrying out a detailed investigation to learn from this and prevent it happening again. In the meantime, we’ve replaced the pole and his broadband service has been connected,” it says. BT, the firm with which you have the contract, and the one responsible for paying the compensation (presumably reclaimed from Openreach) says: “We’re sorry for the delay. We’ve been working closely with Openreach to get him connected and have been keeping [NM] regularly updated. His broadband has been installed and we’ve provided compensation to make up for the delay.” You are just happy to be finally connected. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

2/21/2022,"Q Seven years’ ago – aged 60 – we downsized and bought a small flat by the Cornish seaside for £135,000 in cash. We have found we are too far from our grandchildren and want to move to a town near Bristol. We have no savings and very little income apart from two state pensions.  We can’t decide whether to sell our Cornish flat and buy a park home or small flat in the town. The alternative might be to rent out the flat in order to fund the rent on something up there. Or there’s the risky route of renting this flat out as a holiday let all summer and coming back for the winter.JW A I can’t tell you whether the last option you mention is possible. I would need a local holiday-let expert to tell me first, whether your flat is the kind of place which would be solidly booked from the beginning of the season to its end and second, whether in its current state it is suitable as a holiday let. If the answer to both questions is a “no” then I suspect you can rule out option three. If the answers are “yes” but “no”, you need to think about how you are going to pay for the improvements necessary to make the flat a going concern. Without savings, this could be tricky. I’m also not sure that this option meets the brief of wanting to see more of your grandchildren as you wouldn’t get to see them over winter when you are back in Cornwall, but maybe I’ve missed something. As to option two, it is also only an option if the rental income (after tax) on the Cornish flat is enough to cover the rent charged on a property you would be happy with in the Bristol area. I suspect that it won’t be. On a happier note – but depending a lot on what you can sell your Cornish flat for – you should be able to find something to buy in the town you are interested in. If you limit yourself to properties only available to the over 60s, £129,950 buys you a one-bed flat on the high street; £165,000 gets you a two-bed flat which “enjoys a south-facing aspect and a pleasant open view to the front”; while stretching to £255,000 means you could have a one-bedroom flat close to amenities and handy for buses to Bristol and the surrounding area. To sum up, I think you need to ask local experts to give you actual figures to enable you to come to a decision that is right for you.  Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

2/21/2022,"Today’s puzzle concerns contestants in a fictitious game show trying to win £1m. It was also once given to a different sort of contestant competing for a different sort of prize: candidates applying to study joint philosophy degrees at Oxford university. The teenagers were hoping to study PPE (politics, philosophy and economics), Maths and Philosophy, and Computer Science and Philosophy. They were set the puzzle in their admissions interviews, as part of a back-and-forth discussion in which the interviewer may have given hints and asked probing questions. The interviewer was focussed on how the candidates went about solving the puzzle as much as the solutions they gave.  It’s a really interesting puzzle, and – as we will see - relates to fundamental issues in logic and computer science. The game show You are a contestant on a game show with a £1m prize. A second contestant is in another room. The game is cooperative, so either you both win, or you both lose. You have never met the other contestant before, but you can assume they are just as logical as you are. The game begins with round 1, then proceeds with rounds 2, 3, and so on, for as many rounds as need be. On each round, each contestant has two choices: EITHER To tell the host: “I end the game” and announce a colour (any colour, of the contestant’s choice.) OR To send a message (of any length) to the other contestant. If you both choose to send a message, the messages are sent simultaneously, crossing in transit. To win the game you must both end the game on the same round, announcing the same colours. If only one of you ends the game, or you both end it announcing different colours, you lose. Round 1 is about to begin. What do you do? Clearly, you don’t end the game on round 1. That’s a self-evidently bad strategy. If you end the game, you would have to announce a colour, let’s say red. To win the £1m, the other contestant must also decide to end on the first round (unlikely) and also announce red (also unlikely). Don’t do it. The best strategy will involve some kind of dialogue between you and the other contestant. Let’s briefly consider a simpler variation of the puzzle, which will help us understand what the main puzzle is asking you to do. In this variation, the set-up is exactly the same, except that in each round only one contestant sends a message. In round 1 you send a message, in round 2 the other contestant sends you a message, and you continue alternating between the two of you. In this ‘alternating’ version, a simple strategy presents itself. Your round 1 message could be: “I will declare red on round 2; if you also do we will win.” Or, if you are more cautious, you may say: “let’s declare red in round 3, please confirm in round 2”. Remember, the other contestant wants to cooperate, and so will follow your lead. You will both win the £1m by round 3. This strategy, however, does not work in the original puzzle, when both of you must send messages simultaneously. Imagine your round 1 message is “let’s declare red in round 3, please confirm in round 2”. The other contestant is just as smart and logical as you, so they may have had the same idea, but with another colour! Let’s say their message is: “let’s declare blue in round 3, please confirm in round 2.” Where does that leave you both? Who confirms what colour in round 2? The crux of this puzzle is to understand that whatever message you send the other contestant, they may simultaneously send you exactly the same message but concerning a different colour. You must find a strategy that breaks this impasse. When this puzzle was used in Oxford admissions interviews, the contestant was not expected to come up with a perfect answer straight away. For a start, there is no clear-cut, “best message” to ask in round 1, since the effectiveness of any message will depend on the message you receive, and there is no way that you can know that in advance. Rather, the puzzle led to an open-ended discussion of the issues involved. There may be no “best initial message” but certain strategies are vastly better than others. The tutor may also have introduced these two variations: The collision variation: The contestants have three choices each round. Either they can end the game and announce a colour, or they can send a message, as in the standard version, or they can do nothing. If both players send a message, the messages collide and are not delivered. In this case, each player gets an error message saying the message was not delivered. What do you do? The pigeon variation: Only one contestant sends a message per round (like the simplified version mentioned above). You start in round 1, the other contestant sends in round 2, and you continue alternating between you. Although this time, you are a long distance from each other and the messages are sent via carrier pigeon, which means you can never be sure that the messages arrive. What do you do? These variations also begin to explain what the puzzle has got to do with computer science: they are analogies of the problems that arise when computers talk to each other.

2/21/2022,"Mike Cannon-Brookes has rejected a suggestion by Scott Morrison that a plan to shut AGL Energy’s coal power plants early would push up electricity bills, with the tech billionaire arguing fossil fuel generators are increasingly unreliable and new solar and wind lowers prices for consumers. Morrison on Monday responded to a proposed joint takeover of AGL by Cannon-Brookes and the Canadian asset management giant Brookfield. The prime minister said the government wanted coal plants to run until the end of their scheduled operating life and he was “very committed to sweating those assets” to ensure a reliable electricity supply at affordable prices.  Two Liberal moderates, however, have warmly welcomed the bid for AGL, with backbencher Jason Falinksi stating “this is a real positive”. AGL rejected the initial bid by Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes’s Grok Ventures to buy the company for about $8bn, shut its coal plants by 2030, and build or contract for about 8 gigawatts of new renewable energy and storage to replace it. But the consortium immediately pledged to continue to work on a takeover plan in shareholders’ interests. Asked about Morrison’s comments, Cannon-Brookes said the existing listed closure dates for Australia’s coal plants were not realistic, did not reflect “the economic life of those assets” and the consortium would spend up to $20bn on top of the sale price to replace AGL’s coal fleet “at a much lower price and a much higher reliability”. “Let’s face it – those coal plants aren’t exactly winning awards for reliability,” Cannon-Brookes, the co-creator of the software company Atlassian and one of Australia’s richest people, told Guardian Australia. “We’re trying to do this to provide lower power prices to the customers of AGL that increasingly want clean power as well because they have their own decarbonisation goals.” Cannon-Brookes said Australians were enjoying the lowest power prices in eight years, as the government had consistently pointed out, due to a significant increase of renewable energy into the power grid. He said his consortium was doing what the Morrison government had demanded when it called on the private market to replace coal plants before they closed so the commonwealth did not have to intervene further in the electricity market. “The private market is stepping up and providing that replacement capacity exactly as asked, and on an earlier schedule, which will result in lower power prices for all of those customers,” he said. “I assume he [Morrison] will be very happy with that.” Morrison’s dismissal of the proposal was backed more forcefully by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who said “affordable, deliverable, 24/7, no-questions-asked power” was essential to making Australia “strong”. Joyce contended on Monday that wind and solar energy did not meet those criteria. Joyce said if there was a problem down the line associated with replacing coal-fired power generation with renewable generation, Cannon-Brookes would not have to deal with it. “Poor people will pay for that problem,” he said. Cannon-Brooks said the takeover plan could create 10,000 construction jobs and would eliminate all emissions from Australia’s biggest corporate polluter by 2035. AGL is responsible for more than 8% of the national carbon footprint. Asked what role he would play if the bid was successful, Cannon-Brookes said he was currently focused on “trying to explain to shareholders why we believe this is the best option” and to show to everyone involved there were “alternate paths to this transformation”. He said he “deeply believed” decarbonisation was Australia’s greatest economic opportunity. “I’m happy to help in any which way. Obviously, my wife [Annie] and I and my family office have put a significant amount of capital into this, and this is not a philanthropic exercise. We believe that the economics stack up here and we can use our capital, which we’re very fortunate to have, in a catalytic way to help trigger and create that change,” he said. Two Liberal moderates warmly welcomed the bid for AGL. Falinksi said on Monday: “I think this is the market working.” “The bid has been rejected so [the consortium] will have to revise their numbers. But what Mike Cannon-Brookes is saying makes sense. He can deliver electricity for lower prices using renewables than using legacy coal assets,” the Mackellar MP said. “As long as he can make the numbers stack up around dispatchable power and reliability, which – with the cost of battery power declining and with pumped hydro coming online – then he can probably do that. This makes sense and he’s probably getting the assets on the cheap, so well done.” Fellow New South Wales moderate Andrew Bragg said the bid suggested investors now had the right policy signals to drive the energy transition. “The energy transition is going to be very expensive and it will be heavily reliant on foreign capital, which is why sending the right signals to foreign capital is important,” the senator said. “I think [the proposal] is good. It is good to see foreign and domestic capital seeking to propel the transition”. AGL recently brought forward the nominated closure date for two of its coal plants, Bayswater in NSW and Loy Yang A in Victoria, to no later than 2033 and 2045 respectively. The closure of its Liddell coal generator, also in NSW, had already been accelerated to next year. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AGL said it had rejected the unsolicited preliminary offer of $7.50 a share, which offered a 4.7% premium on Friday’s closing price of $7.16. Including AGL’s debt, the offer was in the range of $8bn. AGL said it was not in the best interest of shareholders. The consortium partners argued it was as it would avoid a “potentially value destructive” demerger under which AGL proposes to break off its coal plants into a separate entity to be called Accel Energy. It said the offer represented about a 20% premium on the company’s three-month volume-weighted average price of $6.28 a share. The owners of Australia’s coal-fired generators are under increasing pressure, both economic due to the rise of cheap solar energy in the national grid, and from activist shareholders to act in line with the Paris climate agreement. On Thursday, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025 rather than 2032. AGL’s share price finished Monday up 10.6% to $7.92. It had earlier topped $8 for the first time since mid-July.",News/Business,Mike Cannon-Brookes dismisses PM’s suggestion that coal plants should run to end of scheduled life,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/mike-cannon-brookes-dismisses-pms-suggestion-that-coal-plants-should-run-to-end-of-scheduled-life

2/21/2022,"A bronze statue of 19th-century Belgian king Léopold II in the centre of Brussels could be melted down and turned into a monument to the millions who died during his brutal rule of the Belgian Congo and other victims of colonialism, an expert group has suggested. The group of historians, architects and other specialists, commissioned by the Brussels regional government, also suggests a second option for the Léopold II bronze: creating an open-air statue park to house the equestrian work, along with other controversial monuments to figures of the colonial past.  The two scenarios were proposed in a 256-page report on the “decolonisation” of public space in the Belgian capital, which was commissioned by Brussels after Black Lives Matter protests swept across the city in 2020. The Léopold II equestrian statue, close to the Royal Palace, became a flashpoint for protesters during what became the largest demonstrations against racism in Brussels that participants could remember. Brussels has scores of monuments and streets named after the men who built Belgium’s empire in the late 19th century “scramble for Africa”. King Léopold II ran the Congo as his personal fiefdom from 1885 to 1908, when millions of people died of brutal treatment, hunger and disease. The Belgian state took over the Congo from 1908 until 1960, gaining colonies in modern-day Rwanda and Burundi from Germany after the first world war. Belgium’s colonial legacy, including violence against African populations, the theft of natural resources and anti-black racism are “established historical facts that are not always recognised and fully acknowledged by Belgium,” states the report. The group does not recommend tearing down all statutes, but proposes a case-by-case approach on what to do with them. Some monuments could be removed to museums or a statue park; others could be renamed or put in context with information plaques. “A decolonised public space is not a space in which all colonial traces have been effaced,” stated the report, “but free of material elements that promote then and now the asymmetric relation between the former white ‘civiliser’ and the former colonised black person, perpetuating a racist ideology and inequalities”. The Parc du Cinquantenaire, a monumental green space built to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Belgian state, financed by wealth pouring in from Congolese rubber, should be redeveloped, the expert group suggested. A monument in the park to the “Belgian pioneers” of the colonies should be renamed “monument to the deconstruction of Belgian colonial propaganda”, they suggested. The expert group also proposed a memorial to the victims of colonisation, as well as a museum or documentation centre where people can learn about Belgium’s imperial past. It warns against changing names by public vote, however, highlighting the furore when the Léopold II tunnel in Brussels was renamed after the late Belgian singer Annie Cordy in 2021. The singer, who died in 2020, came top of a public vote on renaming the tunnel, but the choice was controversial. Some criticised her old hit Hot Chocolate for its crude racial stereotypes, although her family strongly denied she had racist intentions. Others deplored the decision to name the tunnel in bilingual Brussels, after a singer far better known among Francophone Belgians than Dutch speakers. While fans said the decision to give an “ugly, dirty” tunnel her name was an “insult to her memory”. Pascal Smet, the minister in charge of urban planning for the Brussels capital region, said the group had taken a nuanced approach in addressing colonial monuments. “The easiest thing would be to get rid of all the statues, but they didn’t choose that,” he said. “Of course we all know for the individuals that are living in our city today, nobody is responsible for the colonisation, so there is no question of culpability, but it’s a question of a collective responsibility,” he said. “I think it very important, especially in the times that we are living now … not be stuck in history, but to understand history.” Many Brussels residents did not realise the significance of some colonial-era monuments and street names, he said. He had been unaware that the large thoroughfare, rue Général Jacques, had a link with the Congo. The street commemorates Jules Jacques, who organised punitive expeditions against Congolese workers who resisted Belgian-imposed rubber collection, but was later celebrated as a national hero during the first world war. Smet, who signs the permits to erect and dismantle monuments, hopes to publish an action plan by September, with the first decisions on individual monuments taken at the end of the year. A memorial to the victims of colonisation could be funded by the Belgian public sector and companies that profited from empire, he suggested. It was clear “something has to be done” with the Léopold II statue in central Brussels, but further debate was needed, he said. Belgium’s federal government, the owner of the central Brussels Léopold II bronze, would take the final decision, while choices on street names fall largely to local authorities in Brussels’ 19 communes. Smet promised the report would not languish. “This is not going to be a report that we have and say ‘ahh that’s interesting’ and then we put it on the shelf. This is going to be a report that has to be followed up.” ",News/World news,Call for Brussels statue to be melted and made into memorial for Congo victims,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/call-for-brussels-statue-to-be-melted-and-made-into-memorial-for-congo-victims
2/21/2022,"There are two lines of attack in the current culture wars. The first is slow, steady and discreet, marching by stealth through Britain’s institutions. The second is a brazen, loud artillery attack armed with cliches and buzzwords that are fired out across the media. The recent speech from the Conservative party chair, Oliver Dowden, to the Heritage Foundation in Washington is an example of the latter. It was a word salad into which he lazily and dispassionately (repeating this stuff really must get very boring) tossed a target list of vague and intangible concepts such as “cancel culture”, “woke psychodrama”, “obsessing over pronouns” and attempts to “decolonise mathematics”.  If the purpose of this kind of quick-fire attack is recruitment, then the slower, more covert attacks are for annexation. An example of the latter also came about recently, in the form of new guidance by the Department for Education on political impartiality in England’s classrooms. The document singled out topics such as empire, racism and the climate crisis as “political issues” that should be treated with care, moving the parameters of what teachers and students perceive as “neutral” and what is “ideological” another inch to the right. This side of the culture wars takes its time to cover ground by influencing education and culture. Those advancing this line of attack in government often act behind closed doors, so that by the time their goals are made public it’s too late to challenge them. Last month, the government announced that BBC funding from the licence fee would be frozen for the next two years, raised concerns about the BBC’s “impartiality and groupthink”, and suggested that its public funding model could face abolishment (although it later softened its stance). So opaque was the process that Richard Sharp, the chair of the BBC, said the broadcaster was blindsided by the decision being announced not to those concerned at the BBC itself, but via briefings to the Sunday papers. He told BBC Radio 4 that he “hadn’t anticipated learning what I learned over the weekend” as discussions had been ongoing with the government and were, as far as he knew, inconclusive. But discussions had been concluded elsewhere. At the end of 2020, a 10-person panel was appointed to help decide the BBC’s future and funding model. It was not set up under Cabinet Office guidelines, met only in secret, and freedom of information requests for a record of the proceedings were refused. Loud and quiet goes the pattern of culture war advance, like the children’s song: “loud and quiet, fast and slow.” Of recent wins, the expropriation and ubiquitisation of the word “woke” has been the quickest. Most people don’t actually know what “woke” means. But, to quote Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory explaining the nonsensical lyrics to a song: “Nobody knows what it means but it’s provocative. It gets the people going.” All that matters is that people pick up on its implications and intimations. Different permutations of “wokeness” have always been useful, leveraged by the right to portray any social change as a matter of exuberant and unhinged vandalism to the status quo. This is not a new tactic (little in the culture wars is): wokeness is the new “loony left” or “PC gone mad”, a swapping of terms to portray the left as an absurdity and threat which has been around since at least the 1950s. What is frustrating is that for a tactic that has been used for so long, progressive politicians still do not seem to have understood that the only way to beat the charge is to own it. To say when confronted with an issue presented as a matter of wokeness: “What do you mean by woke?” To expose and mock the term for its threadbareness, or to question its very pejorative use. I’ll take anything really at this point, as long as it is delivered with authenticity and swagger. Imagine hearing a politician say something like: “If by ‘woke’ you mean ending racism and inequality, reforming our curriculums so that they are factual and representative both of historical truth and how Britain is changing, and striving for a world where your chances in life are determined as little as possible by your birth, then sign me up.” I would think I was hallucinating. The signal the left sends by letting the term be claimed by the right is so powerful that Labour politicians are now in the bizarre position of denying the existence of the culture wars but being simultaneously afraid of being called woke. In an interview with the Telegraph earlier this year, Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, showed how cornered and defeated progressives can be by letting the term “woke” go uncontested, while being entirely pinned down by its assaults. She said there is a lot of “false division” created by the right on matters such as statues that she would not indulge as culture secretary. She then fell right into the biggest false division of all. “I wouldn’t say I’m woke. I’m not woke, but I’m not anti-woke either,” she said, like Schrödinger’s cat. “I’m just kind of fairly ordinary. I will absolutely sort of cry my eyes out at Strictly Come Dancing where a deaf woman wins it and a same-sex couple are the runners-up. I think that was a fantastic kind of illustration of where woke and anti-woke meet.” Don’t laugh – “woke and anti-woke” is actually a good summary of Labour’s response when it comes to the culture wars. It’s risk avoidance. What it really means is that the party is taking the moral high ground on the basis that it cares only about tangible issues that impact people’s lives in a strict economic sense, but is otherwise, to put it bluntly, frit. To engage in clear, studied defendable positions on hot button issues such as racism and colonialism that influence school policy, the media, and cultural institutions risks them being smoked out in the open about things that, through Labour’s appeasement in the culture wars, may well be poll kryptonite and tabloid ammunition. What helps this state of acquiescence is that there are lulls, missteps and retreats in the culture wars, inviting speculation that it’s all a distraction or “running out of steam”, an artefact of an ebullient post-Brexit Conservative party. And yes, sometimes it is a distraction, sometimes these issues do go away for a while. But the potential for new momentum is always there, ready to be accelerated further by a media that loves a good war, whatever the speed. Just look at the vigour with which newspapers ran front pages on the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi’s, latest guidelines and Dowden’s Washington speech, amping them up to claim that Black Lives Matter’s “biased” views are to be avoided (the Times), that students are being “indoctrinated” (the Daily Mail), and that Dowden’s words must be translated into “action” (the Telegraph). You don’t have to have a sophisticated grasp of what “woke” means to absorb the message being sent here: if you don’t vote for the Conservative party again and again, bad things are going to happen. With a zombie prime minister and a Brexit wrung of populist opportunities, culture wars campaigning will likely intensify in the lead-up to the local elections in May – and the next general election. There will be a lot of “Mr Dowden goes to Washington” silliness about woke maths, but there will also be a lot of gravely serious, opinion-forming, institution-changing propaganda and policy that we on the left cannot simply pretend we are rising above. In fact we are just hiding, hoping and praying that these moves won’t be crucial to refreshing the chances of a desperate government out of ideas. That sounds pretty risky to me.

2/21/2022,"Find out what the market is like for the product or service you are offering. How many other people are offering the same, or similar? Do they seem to be busy? How much do they charge?  Some particularly profitable hobbies include making quality bespoke goods such as jewellery, wall hangings, buying and reselling vintage fashion, or services such as music or language tutoring and gardening. Think, too, about where you see these services advertised. Etsy, for example, is a great place to sell crafts but sites such as Fiverr and TaskRabbit are better for selling skills, such as home improvement or writing services. Make sure you are clear on any regular costs incurred by selling your services or products on these platforms. Etsy charges 15p for each listing and asks for a 5% fee when you sell. If you make a sale directly through its offsite advertising, it charges a 15% fee. It is free to set up on TaskRabbit – it adds a standard service fee on to your client’s invoice, as well as any VAT. Fiverr, meanwhile, takes 20% of every transaction and charges your clients a service fee. Does the cost justify the profits you stand to make – or would it be easier to sell via social media, on sites such as Facebook Marketplace? Don’t sign up to anything that costs money until you’ve considered your options. The last thing you want is another bill that adds to your monthly expenses rather than helping alleviate them. Deciding on the perfect price point is key to the success of your side project. You want to charge a figure that is competitive, will satisfy your customer, and bring in the money you need to make a profit. To do this, consider your costs for making a single item or providing a service. How much will raw materials, posting and packaging, travel expenses and more, add up to? Can you lower these costs by buying some items in bulk – or exploiting supplier discounts? If you are selling something you make, consider, too, how long it takes and your level of experience. If, for example, it requires days of work to make a single piece, the price should reflect that. Consider what the price you are thinking of charging converts to as an hourly rate, and decide if that is reasonable. If you are providing a service, this will be more straightforward – and easier to compare with the market. If in doubt go over, rather than under. It is far easier to reduce the price than it is to increase it. Think about who your typical customer is likely to be and where they might look for a product or service you are selling. Are they social media users or using search engines such as Google to locate what they need quickly? Do they live locally, or are they spread across the country? It can make sense to do your marketing and sales in one place. For example, if you set up a storefront on Instagram or Facebook you can grow your audience on the same platform via hashtags and content. These are free to set up and launch. If you want to upgrade for greater reach and management options when you become more established, there are a number of pricing plans via software companies such as Ecwid that allow you to do so from £19 a month. Alternatively, you can set up your own website for free via sites such as Wix.com and use social media tools purely for marketing purposes. Take advantage of classic PR and marketing opportunities by offering comment to journalists looking for information about your products or areas of expertise, sending samples, or guest blogging for sites that target the type of audience you are trying to reach. Local free magazines and forums are a good place to get your name known. Dr Nikki Ramskill turned her hobby of blogging about personal finances into a small coaching business, the Female Money Doctor, which she runs alongside her main job as a GP. She charges £1,050 for a bundle of six money coaching sessions, as well as providing free resources and low-cost planning advice to those who need it via her website. “Stay organised,” she says. “Dedicate a time to work on your project, and do a little towards it every day, even if it is just posting a listing on Etsy. Be gentle with yourself and realistic about how much you can achieve around your main job.” She also recommends keeping marketing and admin tasks small – and not letting perfect be the enemy of good. “Master a handful of things first,” she says. “No one is amazing at social media straight away, it evolves as time goes on and you adapt. It doesn’t have to be perfect either. Don’t spend hours choosing a colour for your logo, for example. You can always adapt it further down the line.” Set up an account for your hobby to separate your earnings from your personal finances, and consider using digital tools to stay on top of your taxes. Any side business earning upwards of £1,000 a year must be declared to HM Revenue and Customs, and you need to complete a tax return at the end of January each year or face penalties and fines. Enzo Ottens is a co-founder of the fintech app Earnr, which allows you to track how much income tax you owe as you earn before you earn £3,000. “One of the main things we try to warn people about beforehand is to think about whether to set up a limited company,” he says. “Mainly because of the additional admin that comes with that – the balance sheets, the statement of accounts – and the hundreds you will end up paying an accountant to manage it. We recommend setting up as a sole trader first. “We also see a lot of our customers register with HMCR too early – even before they’ve made £1,000 in sales. And then they have to do a tax return even though they may not yet have made those sales.” Other products aimed at those running small businesses include NatWest’s Mettle account, which allows you to create and send invoices on the go and prepare your accounts for taxes, and Mastercard’s SumUp app, which creates payment links you can send to customers and clients. Both are free to set up.",Lifestyle/Money,How to turn your hobby into an income stream,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/how-to-turn-your-hobby-into-an-income-stream
2/21/2022,"It is now 13 years since Harry Parker stepped on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan, creating a blast that would result in the loss of both legs. Alongside the physical pain of the subsequent weeks, months and years, he also had to cope with a profound change in his sense of self. He compares the experience to that of Gregor Samsa, the subject of Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis – “the strangeness of not being who you used to be, turned into something that sets you apart from those around you”. Equipped with two hi-tech prosthetic limbs, Parker can now walk holding hands with his wife and carry his children on his shoulders. From the outside, it would be easy to conclude that he has adapted extraordinarily well to the event – and he says that “being an amputee feels normal”. But he still considers himself to be a different person – a “new body with a new identity” who is “12% machine”.  It is this transformation that forms the emotional and intellectual heart of Parker’s fascinating new book, Hybrid Humans, which examines the cutting edge of medical technology and the implications of these developments for our identities. The term “hybrid human” is personal: it sits more comfortably than other potential descriptions for his experience, Parker says – compared with “disabled” at the one extreme or “cyborg” at the other. The term may have the ring of futurism for many readers, but hybrid humans have been around since antiquity. Just consider Tabaketenmut, the daughter of an Egyptian priest who lived about 3,000 years ago. She seems to have lost her big toe to gangrene, which would have been a huge impediment to walking. (The big toe carries 40% of our body weight as we propel ourselves forward.) To solve this problem, she was equipped with an articulated prosthesis, made from wood and leather, with holes that could have laced the artificial toe to the foot. Ancient Romans, meanwhile, created prosthetic limbs from bronze and wood. Parker’s writing is elegant and often lyrical. He is particularly eloquent when describing the psychology of hybridity – how the mind melds with the machine. The brain, we hear, can quickly enlarge its body map to encompass a tool, creating the sense that it is a physical part of us. It is the reason that drivers duck when their car passes under a low barrier – in some sense, we have become the vehicle. Even an object such as a smartphone can become an extension of our mind – as we come to rely on it for memory storage and communication. This neural flexibility is common to all human beings. “We are set up for plug and play,” Parker says. But the emotional connection between an amputee such as Parker and the prostheses they wear is necessarily much more profound than most people’s experiences of technology. His legs may not be made of flesh, but they are critical for his humanity. “When I am without them, I feel less alive,” he writes. Awe-inspiring innovations have made Parker’s current life possible. His right knee, for example, is controlled by a microprocessor, with sophisticated sensors that can gauge the forces on the leg and guide its movements. It is, he says, like having another brain within his limb. And Parker gives us a taste of even more astonishing developments from the technological frontier, describing technologies such as exoskeletons – fitted over the body – that could allow people who are paralysed to walk again, and robotic skin, fitted with sensors, that could restore a sense of touch to people with spinal cord injuries. Such successes are often overhyped by the media, but Parker avoids this trap. Newspapers and websites may breathlessly celebrate the use of bionic eyes that can allow people with visual impairments to see again, for instance, but Parker points out that the resolution is very low. At best, someone using these devices can make out a few shapes that may help with navigation. And there are risks. Bionic eyes use metal electrodes implanted in the brain to communicate their signals. The electrical discharge can damage neural tissue, rendering them less effective over time. Scientists may find solutions to these problems – such as electrodes coated with stem cells that may sprout roots into the living tissue – but progress is made of small steps rather than giant leaps. Unlike many technology writers, Parker also recognises the social inequalities that are inherent in these innovations. Organisations such as the NHS cannot invest in the most up-to-date prostheses, meaning that the latest technology must be bought with private riches. For some, the necessary funds may come through insurance or compensation – but if you are born poor, with a congenital disorder, you may never make use of any of these technological developments within your lifetime. (My mother, an amputee, is still using the same basic design of prosthetic leg that she was given more than four decades ago.) Parker points out that it is often the very people who are most likely to suffer disability who are the least able to afford the best treatment – which, of course, makes it harder to find a way out of the poverty trap. His scepticism is particularly welcome when he meets some transhumanists, the followers of a philosophical movement that advocates the use of technology to overcome the limitations of our evolved brains and bodies. Among their many plans, they suggest that we all be fitted with brain implants that could give us instant access to vast stores of knowledge or link us up to other brains to create telepathic communication. Some transhumanists even hope that technology will allow us to beat death – by, for example, uploading our consciousness to an artificial intelligence, so that we are no longer reliant on our ageing and fragile wetware. For now, these are far-fetched dreams, and it’s not just the practical challenges of creating this technology that bothers Parker; the goals themselves seem undesirable. “I can’t imagine the pain, anxiety and frustrations of being a sentient being uploaded to a hard drive – what it would be like never again to feel rain on my face, or the visceral feeling of my family when we all bundle together on the sofa for a hug.” And doesn’t the possibility of death add meaning to our lives that would be lost with technological immortality? As someone who has lived as a “hybrid” for more than a decade, Parker never forgets the realities of everyday life, which encompass both pain and beauty. This may be a tour of the scientific avant garde, but the focus is always on the human heart and mind.

2/21/2022,"Wordle has exploded. Since launching in October, the word game has become a viral success thanks to users (including me) falling in love with the simple but frustrating task of guessing a five-letter word in six attempts. Like most puzzles, Wordle can be solved alone. But the game brings out the braggers and those braggers can offer up a treasure trove of data. Mathematicians have looked at players’ results to better understand the game and the way we play it.  Professor Barry Smyth, the digital chair of computer science at University College Dublin, analyzed more than 3m tweets from 800,000 Wordle players who had “won” the game (meaning that they guessed the word in six tries or fewer). The tweets show people getting better over time – on average, they manage to solve the game in fewer rounds the more they play. The tweets also show the probability of guessing the correct letter (yellow), guessing the correct letter in the correct place (green) or just getting it plain wrong (grey). No surprise, the chances of guessing the correct word get higher with each subsequent round, but the data shows the importance of letter placement. The second letter of the word is easiest to guess (72% of the time, it has been guessed correctly in the fifth round), the third letter is the next easiest (65%), followed by the last letter (52%). First and fourth letters are most likely to trip you up. And if you want to up your strategy, Smyth also discovered the best start words (scroll all the way to the bottom if you would like a spoiler – it’s not adieu!). Unsurprisingly, a computer program does much better than a bunch of tweeting human Wordle players. Xan Gregg, a data visualization software developer, did a deep analysis to find the hardest Wordle words. It turns out, almost every single word could be solved by the computer in five guesses or less – just three words required all six guesses (mummy, shush and yummy). By feeding a computer program 3,622 words, Gregg also found an optimal start word (also mentioned in the spoilers below – it’s different from the best word based on Wordle players’ success!). Like all data, both of these analyses miss something. Neither of them manage to capture quitting. A computer can just keep going and going with the guesswork, and Smyth only analysed people who had tweeted their results after winning the game. That’s a shame – I’m curious which five-letter word is most likely to leave us feeling defeated (“aroma” brought me close to tears). Smyth found that in over 95% of games where the word “tales” was used as a start word, the player was successful (and they were successful fast, 83% of them succeeded within four rounds). Another highly effective strategy was to combine two start words – to use “cones” followed by “trial”. Instead of looking at successful games played by humans, Xan Gregg found the best start word by allowing a computer to try out 3,622 start words. The word “crate” resulted in the computer winning in the fewest number of rounds.",Arts/Games, What the numbers tell us about the best – and worst – Wordle start words,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/21/wordle-starting-words-numbers-probability
2/21/2022,"When Frank Farrell’s retirement day came in 2018 – after 35 years of teaching – everyone thought he “would be straight down the pub to celebrate”. Instead, he stayed sober and prepared his materials: the next day he began his new career as a magician. He was 60, and he didn’t yet feel like a magician, but that weekend Mr Farrell the English teacher gave way to Magic Frank. Under this stage name, he performed 10 shows at a Harry Potter convention in Manchester. Farrell had been dabbling in magic since his 30s, but the scale of these gigs – he was paid nearly £2,000 – struck him as “a mark of respect” and validation. “I started to consider myself a magician, not someone who does a bit of magic on the side.”  A mentalist who specialises in card tricks, Farrell performs “parlour shows” at weddings, birthdays or Women’s Institute gatherings. The audience’s gaze is so intense, he feels his hands burn. Applause breaks from this “sense of wonder … Someone has seen something that logic tells them cannot happen, but which they’ve just seen happen,” he says. “Usually people start laughing. It makes me laugh as well. It feels good.” As a child, Farrell loved magic. The son of Irish immigrants – his father worked in building foundations, his mother as a home help – he grew up in Romford, Essex. Occasionally he trekked to the joke shop on Tottenham Court Road in London to splurge his pocket money on a stink bomb or two, or a device to vanish a ha’penny. “But it fizzled out because there was nothing to nurture it,” he says. “I didn’t know that there’s thousands of books on magic.” Instead, he got into acting. “I think you can see a theme here,” he says, sounding every inch the English teacher. “A need for an audience.” He reprised the magic in his 30s after he and his wife, Sheila, returned from a trip to India. Sheila had impressed some children with an illusion in which she seemed to pass a thread through her neck. Farrell thought: “When I get home I’ll learn some. It’s a useful thing if there’s children around.” He bought a magic book, practised tricks, even found a magic club in Manchester. He and Sheila had two boys, who were mostly unimpressed by the tricks as children. Farrell never worked his magic at school, except as an activity during enrichment week, when pupils had a chance to learn something different to their normal lessons. In some ways, maybe teaching was another parlour show, though. Farrell’s style was “a bit offbeat … I played music. I tried to bring comedy into the classroom.” He put on voices, loved wordplay, and for minor misdemeanours asked students to apologise to his pot plants. At his final summer fair, some of the students wore masks with his face on. Teaching, like magic, is transformative – albeit “a much slower process of transformation”, he says. “With magic you get immediate feedback if it works well. In teaching, that moment might never come. Even if you have had that effect, you might not know.” At first it was a shock to live life without a timetable. But Farrell now rehearses for an hour a day, has up to nine bookings in a month, and spends the rest of the time pitching, handling enquiries and deepening his art. He has finally shaken off any sense of being an impostor. “I can genuinely call myself a magician, because people are paying me to do it.” Clearly, he says, needing validation is a bit of a theme, but he is unsure why and doesn’t like to “navel gaze”. Maybe it “came from having a very ordinary background”, but adds: “Don’t we all want to feel special?” The ability to transform and to create wonder are important to Farrell, and I ask what, in himself, has caused him the greatest wonder? “I find the process of becoming older quite amazing,” he answers. “I have discovered that I am far more self-confident, more relaxed … I am living exactly the type of life I want to live.” When people ask about his retirement he likes to reply: “I’ve always been happy but never been happier.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,"A new start after 60: ‘After 35 years of teaching, I became Magic Frank – and I’ve never been happier’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/21/a-new-start-after-60-after-35-years-of-teaching-i-became-magic-frank-and-ive-never-been-happier
2/21/2022,"The United Nations’ top court will resume hearings into the alleged genocide against Myanmar’s Rohingya minority on Monday, with the military junta expected to represent the country in place of Aung San Suu Kyi. The claim that Myanmar’s military carried out genocide was brought to the international court of justice (ICJ) by the Gambia after a brutal 2017 military crackdown that forced an estimated 700,000 Rohingya to flee over the border to neighbouring Bangladesh. UN investigators have since alleged the military’s operations were carried out with “genocidal intent”.  Previously, Aung San Suu Kyi travelled to the court to defend Myanmar against claims the military carried out mass murder, rape and destruction of Rohingya Muslim communities. She is now being held in detention at the behest of the military, which seized power in a coup last year and charged her with a raft of alleged offences. Monday’s hearing has been preceded by controversy over who should represent the country. The national unity government, formed by elected lawmakers, ethnic minority representatives and activists, has said it intends to represent Myanmar, and that it has withdrawn preliminary objections to the case. It is expected, however, that the military will represent the country. Campaign groups and human rights lawyers have raised concern over the issue, with the Myanmar Accountability Project stating it was “clear the junta has no basis on which to represent the state of Myanmar in any UN body, such as the ICJ or any international organisation.” A representative of the Rohingya Student Network, who spoke from Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, told the Guardian the case represented not only the prospect of justice for Rohingya people but also the “hope to bring a federal democracy in Myanmar for all those who are fighting [for an end to military rule] in Myanmar right now”. The military coup, and the widespread violence since unleashed on the public, has prompted a shift in attitudes towards minorities. Previously there was little solidarity with Rohingya, but since the coup some protesters have apologised for not standing by Rohingya or believing their claims of persecution. “They joined our fight from 1 February,” said the Rohingya activist, who asked not to be named due to security concerns. “They just joined our fight, that we [have been] fighting for decades.” In 2020, Myanmar was ordered by the court to prevent genocidal violence against Rohingya and to preserve any evidence of past crimes. Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, said the military had totally failed to comply with the order. “The Rohingya in Myanmar today are subjected to daily harassment and intimidation by authorities, while there are also state-enforced restrictions on their movement, as well as their access to healthcare, education and livelihoods.” The junta was also blocking humanitarian assistance, leaving many Rohingya on the brink of starvation, he added. This week, the court is due to hear preliminary objections raised by Myanmar. Previously, it has raised several objections, including that the Gambia does not have the legal right to bring a claim because it is unaffected by the alleged abuses. Akila Radhakrishnan, president of the Global Justice Centre, said she did not believe, were the junta to represent Myanmar, that this would lend legitimacy to the military. It was more likely to reflect a continuation of the status quo in court procedures, she said. Radhakrishnan added: “There is such a strong link between impunity and the coup occurring, and the fact that the military has very rarely faced any direct consequences, that I think there is import to the fact that they are learning that they will be hauled into court – and this time around, unlike 2019, they can’t hide behind Aung San Suu Kyi and the civilian government.”",News/World news,Myanmar junta to take place of Suu Kyi at ICJ hearings into Rohingya genocide claims,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/myanmar-junta-to-take-place-of-suu-kyi-at-icj-hearings-into-rohingya-genocide-claims
2/21/2022,"The NSW government has begun issuing flood plain harvesting licences in NSW despite objections from the upper house – a move that has been labelled “an act of bastardry” and “bad faith” by key crossbenchers. Despite strong indications the regulations underpinning the licences could be disallowed for a third time by the Legislative Council, the state’s water minister, Kevin Anderson, is understood to have begun issuing the licences.  Industry sources confirmed that some irrigators in the Gwydir and Border Rivers catchments received decisions on their flood plain harvesting licences this morning. The minister refused to comment. The licensing regime for flood plain harvesting was disallowed twice last year by the upper house with Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers joining forces. A parliamentary committee report also called for further scientific work to establish the extent and impact of flood plain harvesting, which involves capturing floods moving across plains using dams, levees and channels. Environmental scientists have warned over-licensing could have long-term catastrophic impacts on the ability to achieve improvements in the Murray-Darling Basin. But the government has used the parliamentary Christmas break to run down the clock on the 28-day disallowance period after its third attempt to establish the licensing regime which was introduced on 15 December. On Friday, the Perrottet government took a further step, publishing a proclamation that the Water Management Act extended to flood plain harvesting licences in the northern basin – a necessary precursor to issuing the licences. Tuesday will be the first opportunity for the upper house to consider a disallowance motion. “This is an incredible show of bad faith from the new water minister,” the chair of the parliamentary committee, Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, said. “The government has had every opportunity to work with the crossbench and opposition to address the concerns of the community. Instead, they’re choosing to rush through flood plain harvesting licences in the dead of the night, bugger the consequences. “The committee handed down recommendations that would see flood plain harvesting regulated in a way that is lawful and sustainable. The water minister needs to be using this report as a basis for restoring balance in the Murray-Darling Basin, not the pleas of a handful of wealthy irrigators in the north who have been dictating this state’s water policy in their own interests for far too long.” Independent MP Justin Field declared the preemptive move “an act of political bastardry and extraordinary bad faith”.“I’m also extremely concerned it could leave the taxpayer on the hook for future compensation if future governments have to wind back those licences to ensure downstream communities and the environment get their fair share,” Field said. An upper house committee report found that flood plain harvesting has grown dramatically in the past 20 years. It has been blamed by the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists for some of the 20% reduction in flows in the Murray-Darling, along with climate change. The former NSW water minister, Melinda Pavey, reintroduced the regulations that will create the new licences just before Christmas, arguing she had now included more safeguards. Irrigators in north-west NSW, predominantly cotton growers, support the new licences even though some will need to cut their take of flood waters. They argue that the government’s failure to issue licences has left them in a legal limbo, particularly during recent periods of heavy rain, when farmers have been capturing water in dams for future use. The chief executive of the NSW Irrigators’ Council, Claire Miller, said she was pleased the licensing was now proceeding. “All stakeholders agree flood plain harvesting should be reduced, licensed and measured. The reform also means irrigators will be charged for using this water for the first time,” she said. “It is unfathomable why anyone would want to further delay the regulation, licensing and metering of flood plain harvesting and allow the current free-for-all to continue. We need to put the environment ahead of politics.Labor’s spokesperson on water, Rose Jackson, said the party was still considering its position on the latest effort to license flood plain harvesting. “We know the water is being taken. We want to see it licensed so there are regulated volumes, monitoring and enforcement, but it has to be included within the cap on extractions and be sustainable,” Jackson said.",News/Australia news,"NSW government issuing of flood plain harvesting licences ‘an act of bastardry’, crossbenchers say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/nsw-government-issuing-of-flood-plain-harvesting-licences-an-act-of-bastardry-crossbenchers-say
2/21/2022,"The Kurdish transgender woman Doski Azad shot dead by her brother last month, had been living in hiding from her family after repeated death threats, friends have said. According to friends, Azad had had to move home regularly after several death threats by male members of her family.  Three weeks ago, her body was found dumped in a ditch outside of the city of Duhok, in the Iraqi autonomous Kurdistan region. Her hands had been tied and she had been shot twice. Police have issued an arrest warrant for her brother, who is believed to have travelled from his home in Germany to carry out the killing. A talented makeup artist, the 23-year-old had supported herself since her family turned its back on her when she was a young teenager. She went to brides’ homes to prepare them for their weddings and built a reputation that earned her a job at a salon in Duhok. “She was such a nice person, and everyone loved her so much,” said a close friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “She lived alone because when she went to her family home, they said to Doski, ‘Get out’,” the friend said. “They said, ‘When we see you alone, we will kill you’.” According to the Duhok police, Azad was killed by one of her brothers in what was described as an “honour killing”. Police were called to the village of Mangesh, 12 miles (20km) north of Duhok, according to Iraqi-Kurdish news site Rudaw, by another of Azad’s brothers. The killer had allegedly already returned to Germany. “Our investigation so far suggests that Doski Azad was killed by her brother at a location just outside the city before he managed to flee the crime scene,” Duhok police spokesperson, Hemin Suleiman, said. Azad’s friend said attempts had been made on her life before. “When I called her [a while ago] she didn’t answer me, and later I said, ‘Doski, where you have been?’ And she said, ‘My brother came to kill me and I went to the police.’” Another Kurdish transgender woman was murdered last year by family members, Rudaw reported. Yeksani, a Kurdish rights group, said: “Hate crime against LGBT+ community in the Kurdistan region is on the rise.” The group’s director Zhiar Ali said Azad was one of a few openly transgender women in Kurdistan. “This level of freedom in Kurdistan comes at a risk, and we witnessed this in Doski’s case,” Ali said. “Living openly as an LGBT+ person is deeply stigmatised. “Honour killings are very prevalent. We have hundreds of nameless graves, they are marked with numbers. The victims are so disrespected that, not only are they blamed, but they disrespect them even when they are dead.” Ali was critical of the Kurdish media’s coverage of Azad’s death, some of which used derogatory language. “It was a completely irresponsible and disastrous reporting by the Kurdish media,” Ali said, primarily about the Kurdish-language coverage. Rasha Younes, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the murder signalled the “climate of impunity” afforded to perpetrators of anti-LGBTQ+ violence, empowered under Iraq’s penal code to cause harm under the pretext of “honour”. “This has a chilling effect on LGBT Iraqis, for whom the law does not offer protection, rendering any ‘suspicion’ of homosexuality or gender variance a cause for potential violence, which not only results in the death of LGBT people but makes their lives unliveable,” she said. Kurdish activist Amed Sherwan said most hate crimes were not reported. “It is very tragic that someone must pay such a price for being herself. It makes me very sad,” he said. The US, French and German consulates in Erbil condemned the murder on Twitter, as did the UN assistance mission for Iraq and the Canadian mission to Iraq.

2/21/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray here to open the week in news.  A massive leak from one of the world’s biggest private banks, Credit Suisse, has exposed the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes. Details of accounts linked to 30,000 Credit Suisse clients all over the world are contained in the leak, which unmasks the beneficiaries of more than 100bn Swiss francs (£80bn)* held in one of Switzerland’s best-known financial institutions. The leak points to widespread failures of due diligence by Credit Suisse, despite repeated pledges over decades to weed out dubious clients and illicit funds. The Guardian is part of a consortium of media outlets given exclusive access to the data. We can reveal how Credit Suisse repeatedly either opened or maintained bank accounts for a panoramic array of high-risk clients across the world. They include a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock exchange boss jailed for bribery, a billionaire who ordered the murder of his Lebanese pop star girlfriend, and executives who looted Venezuela’s state oil company, as well as corrupt politicians from Egypt to Ukraine. One Vatican-owned account in the data was used to spend €350m (£290m) in an allegedly fraudulent investment in London property that is at the centre of an ongoing criminal trial of several defendants, including a cardinal. The huge trove of banking data was leaked by an anonymous whistleblower to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Credit Suisse said that Switzerland’s strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients. “Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices,” the bank said in a statement, arguing that the matters uncovered by reporters are based on “selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct”. The bank also said the allegations were largely historical, in some instances dating back to a time when “laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the past decade, and a portion remain open today.

Biden, Putin may meet – Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin have agreed in principle to attend a summit aimed at de-escalating the Ukraine crisis, France’s presidency has announced. It follows weekend diplomatic efforts by Emmanuel Macron to avert a Russian invasion. The Élysée Palace said the summit “can only be held if Russia does not invade Ukraine”. The White House said Biden had accepted in principle, although “currently Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon”. Biden convened a rare Sunday meeting of his national security council. Moscow has rescinded its undertaking to end military exercises in Belarus which were due to conclude on Sunday. The Belarus defence ministry said Russian troops would stay indefinitely. We are of course live-blogging all the developments. End of Covid restrictions – Cabinet will meet today to rubber-stamp the lifting of all remaining Covid restrictions in England. Changes are expected to include ending the legal requirement to isolate if you have Covid; ending universal free PCR and lateral flow tests; ending the national contact tracing service; and ending twice-weekly tests for schoolchildren. Boris Johnson told the BBC that coronavirus “remains a dangerous disease” for vulnerable and unvaccinated people, but it was time “to see our country really getting back on its feet”. Separately, Priti Patel has agreed to ban anti-vaxxers from “harmful and disruptive” protests outside schools and vaccination clinics. Buckingham Palace said the Queen, 95, had experienced “mild cold-like symptoms” after testing positive for Covid but was due to continue with light duties this week. And Australia has finally reopened its international borders. SBTV founder dies – Jamal Edwards, who set up the media platform SBTV, which helped catapult grime and new artists like Ed Sheeran, Dave and Jessie J to global fame, died on Sunday morning aged 31. Edwards said he started SBTV “on a £20 phone” while he was still at school and grew it into a leading online youth broadcaster. Edwards was born in Luton in 1990 and grew up in Acton, west London. He received a BTec diploma in media moving image from Ealing College and worked at retail chain Topman to financially support himself while developing SBTV. A director, author, DJ, entrepreneur and designer, he was awarded an MBE in 2014 – when he was 24 – for his work in music. He was an ambassador for the Prince of Wales’s charity, the Prince’s Trust, and undertook extensive philanthropic work, including in mental health and the funding of youth centres. Ottawa freed of convoy – Canadian police have fenced off the Ottawa city centre after evicting the “Freedom Convoy” led by truck drivers opposed to a vaccine mandate. Seventy-six vehicles had been towed, police said on Sunday, and with the end of the three-week occupation came 191 arrests and the prospect of more. Demonstrators had used hundreds of trucks and vehicles to block the city centre since 28 January. On the weekend police used pepper spray and stun grenades to clear most of the area in front of Canada’s federal parliament. Protesters who were filmed by police and had left the city would be held to account, said Ottawa’s interim police chief, Steve Bell. “We will actively look to identify you and follow up with financial sanctions and criminal charges.” Canada’s parliament is due on Monday to vote on whether to keep in force emergency powers invoked by the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. House prices spiral up – First-time buyers are expected to lose out again in the race to buy the few properties on the market. Asking prices for homes newly listed in Britain rose by a record 2.3% in February, according to the property website Rightmove. The site said it was the biggest monthly increase in the 20 years it has kept records – the average advertised cost of a home was up by £7,785, to £348,804. The number of new property listings increased by 11% during the month, but the number of people looking to buy a property rose by 16%. Rightmove’s figures say average asking prices have risen by nearly £40,000 in the two years since the pandemic started, compared with £9,000 in the previous two years. A leak of data from Credit Suisse has shown how it provided services to known criminals and fraudsters for decades.

The Manchester United manager, Ralf Rangnick, condemned the unsavoury scenes that led to Anthony Elanga being struck by a coin from the Leeds United stand during a fiery contest at Elland Road on Sunday, with the hosts investigating the incident. Dreaming is for free, as someone round these parts once said, and Daniel Podence’s second-half winner means Wolves are now two points behind fifth place in the Premier League with two games in hand and both Arsenal and West Ham, the two teams immediately above them, to play away this coming week. The former England midfielder Jack Wilshere has joined Danish club Aarhus. There may have been some raised eyebrows at the Lionesses’ unusual starting XI to play Spain but a gutsy and focused performance against a team laden with Barcelona’s Champions League winners earned a 0-0 draw and demonstrated there is serious depth to England’s squad looking ahead to the European Championship this summer. If there is one man England’s rugby team are keen to see back fit and singing the anthems at Twickenham, it is Manu Tuilagi. Asian shares have mostly been lower after a retreat on Wall Street. Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Shanghai declined while Sydney advanced. At time of writing, futures trading suggests the FTSE will open higher while the pound is worth $1.362 and €1.198. The Guardian’s joint Credit Suisse investigation is promoted heavily on page one today. Also on the front: “Last-ditch talks as fears of Ukraine war intensify”. The Queen’s Covid diagnosis is on the front too, and in the conservative press it’s big news that ties in well with the clamoured-for end of England’s coronavirus restrictions. “Queen’s Covid example to us all”, says the Daily Mail. The Telegraph has “Queen vows to carry on working with Covid”. “Queen catches Covid in castle outbreak”, says the Express. The Mirror has “Queen gets Covid but she carries on” and the Metro’s headline is similar: “One keeps calm and carries on”. The Sun puts a foot wrong with “HRH to WFH” – the correct royal style is HM, for Her Majesty. The Times leads with “PM’s ‘pride’ as all restrictions lifted” while the Queen’s diagnosis is an inset panel to that story. In the i they have “Queen still at work with Covid”. The situation on the Ukraine-Russia border is also on fronts of course, and it is the lead in the Financial Times: “Belarus says Russian troops will stay as west seeks Ukraine talks”.
