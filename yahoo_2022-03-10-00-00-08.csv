3/10/2022,"Ally Kostial was about to enter her senior year at the University of Mississippi in Oxford when she was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds not far from campus. A search of her apartment led investigators to her Apple Watch, and discovered that her last text messages were with fellow student Brandon Theesfeld. Lafayette County Sheriff's Investigator Jarrett Bundren says they wanted Theesfeld to come in to talk -- and soon. ""He ... said that he would be there at 8:30 Monday morning,"" Bundren told ""CBS Saturday Morning"" co-host Michelle Miller. ""And 8:30 Monday morning came?"" Miller asked. ""No Brandon,"" Bundren replied. He says that's when the decision was made to start tracking Theesfeld's phone. ""What did you find out?"" Miller asked.""That he was on Interstate 55 headed north toward Memphis,"" said Bundren. District Attorney Ben Creekmore says with Theesfeld appearing to be on the run, investigators got an affidavit of arrest for murder and immediately sent out a bulletin. ""When we saw that his truck was leaving Oxford, there was a BOLO for his tag,"" Creekmore explained. ""BOLO?"" Miller asked. ""Be on the lookout."" It didn't take long for the Memphis Fugitive Task Force to spot Theesfeld. ""About an hour-and-a half, two hours later ... they caught him at the gas station,"" said Bundren. ""He had a .40 caliber gun consistent with the caliber of the shell casings that were found on the scene,"" Creekmore explained. ""And he had blood on him.""Bundren says he headed north to pick up Theesfeld and brought him back to Mississippi. Theesfeld was initially charged with capital one murder, facing the death penalty.

3/10/2022,"KUTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - When Russian tourist Konstantin Ivanov tried to draw money from his home bank account at a cash machine on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, the transaction was blocked. Unprecedented sanctions against Russia's banks over its invasion of Ukraine are taking a toll on its citizens overseas, who have been left scrambling to find cash or turn to crypto transactions to get by. ""This has created a huge problem for us. We have been left completely stripped of our finances - its like they have been completely frozen and we cannot use them at all over here,” said Ivanov, 27, adding that he might have to look for a job in Indonesia. The Russian embassy in the capital Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bali is a popular holiday destination with Russian tourists, who flocked to the island by the tens of thousands before the pandemic and were among the first to return when borders partially reopened last year. About 1,150 Russians entered Indonesia in January 2022, according to data from the statistics bureau. Rifki Saldi Yanto, the manager of a local cafe, said he had noticed a decline in Russian customers in recent days and many now pay with cash instead of credit card. Meanwhile more than 7,000 Russians were stranded in Thailand, another popular beach destination because of flight cancellations, a rouble currency in free-fall and payment issues. [L3N2VB1KZ] Russia's economy is facing its gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, after western countries moved in recent days to isolate it from the global financial system. International payments system SWIFT has disconnected several Russian banks from its network, while Visa and Mastercard said they were blocking overseas use of their cards issued by Russian banks from March 9.
