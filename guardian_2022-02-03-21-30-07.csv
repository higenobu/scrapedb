2/3/2022,"In an east London pub, the Glory, Adam All is pulling bras out from the pockets of his purple suit as he sings on stage. Cheeky, fun and dapper, he wears a glittery waistcoat over a gold satin shirt, his pink bow tie matching the shade of his rectangular glasses. All is a drag king; that is, usually a cisgender woman, transgender man or non-binary person performing in male or masculine drag on stage. This can include singing, lip-syncing and dancing. While drag queens have broken into the mainstream, largely thanks to the success of RuPaul’s Drag Race, their kingly counterparts have been confined to a more underground existence. Tonight, we are in a basement.  Still, things are changing. Since starting out in Southampton in 2008, All is now part of a thriving scene of drag kings across the UK. Being a king is his full-time job. “There are far more of us now, and we are smashing down doors left, right and centre,” he says. Tonight’s event, an open mic for drag kings, is sold out – as was the launch event for new drag king collective KingDom, in the same venue the night before. Armed with swagger, charm and – at times – gyrating hips, drag kings seek to do anything from dismantling the patriarchy and toxic masculinity, often by taking on male stereotypes, to covering mental health, sexuality and gender identity. “The message is much more about nutritious masculinity and looking at how positive that can be for all of society,” says All. This, however, can be a difficult task, explains drag king Chiyo, who describes himself as a “professional hustler”. “With the art of being a drag queen, you get feminine energy, which is beautiful and elegant,” he says. “But, drag kings, we work with masculinity, which is toxic and boring and gross. So we have to find a way to make masculinity not only entertaining, but not toxic, and show people what healthy masculinity can look like.” In London, LGBTQ+ venues – including the Glory, She Soho and Royal Vauxhall Tavern – are increasingly hosting drag-king-specific events, such as annual battle Man Up and showcase Kings of Clubs. Other top names in the capital include Prinx Silver, Don One, Oedipussi Rex, Izzy Aman, Christian Adore and the drag king collective Pecs. “Drag kings are just lovely, so supportive, always gassing you up, always showing up for you,” says Beau Jangles, who started performing as a drag king after going to a workshop run by Pecs in 2018. Since then, Jangles – his name inspired by the dancer Bill “Bojangles” Robinson – has been making waves. In December he performed in a Dick Whittington drag pantomime in the West End of London. “Without doing drag king-ing I wouldn’t have realised that I’m non-binary as quickly,” he explains. “It was very important to me when I was figuring out my queerness, as a way of tapping into the masculinity that I had been told I wasn’t allowed to.” Outside the capital, drag kings are also enjoying success. There is Brighton’s Sammy Silver, Newcastle’s Baron LaVey and, in Bournemouth, two kings who are surely among the best-named in the country: Dandy Issues and Well Hung Parliament. In Cardiff, there is Justin Drag; in Bristol, Oliver Assets and Fluxx Wyldly front the Brizzle Boyz drag king night; and, in Birmingham, Christian Gay and Victor Velvet have created drag night Kings ‘N’ Things. On the Manchester circuit, Mark Anthony is putting a male spin on burlesque, known as “boylesque”. In Glasgow, Dorian T Fisk is at the forefront of a burgeoning Scottish scene, and has been running his Shut Up and King workshops since the start of the pandemic. He wants to see drag kings on an equal footing with the queens. “A lot more show bookers are booking kings, so we’re starting to even out a little bit,” he explains. “But there is a lot of work to be done. We’re still getting queen-only lineups … I’m seeing some of that change happen in Scotland. We’ve proven that people will come and pay to see drag kings on stage.” Based in Derby, Romeo De La Cruz has performed around the UK with the aim of empowering LGBTQ+ people. “For me, it’s to bring, not just drag, but queerness to places where you don’t have that representation,” they say. “It’s about branching out into areas where we need to be showing people that may not have that representation to feel like: ‘Do you know what, there is someone else I can relate to. There is someone else like me. I’m not alone.’ I really enjoy that.” Back at the Glory, All dedicates his final song to Karen Fisch, a veteran drag king performer who is in the audience. What does the future look like for drag kings? “I can see all sorts of exciting things happening for kings,” says All. “I want to say that there will be similar representation of kings as queens in the mainstream. People are demanding change. So it can’t not happen. But how far that goes will be up to whether or not all the right pieces click into place at the right time.”",Arts/Stage,"The inspirational rise of drag kings: ‘We are smashing down doors left, right and centre!’",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/03/the-inspirational-rise-of-drag-kings-we-are-smashing-down-doors-left-right-and-centre
2/3/2022,"The remains of a woolly mammoth, rhinoceros, bison, wolf and hyena have been found in a cave system uncovered by a digger during the building of a new town in the south-west of England. Experts said the find at Sherford, a 5,500-home development on the outskirts of Plymouth, was “exceptional” and gave an astonishing glimpse into the megafauna that roamed what is now Devon between 30,000 and 60,000 years ago.  More than 200 clusters of bones have been carefully removed from the cave and they will be examined to try to help paint a picture of what life was like in ice age Britain. The samples taken from the site have so far uncovered: Partial remains of a woolly mammoth, including a tusk, molar tooth and other bones Partial remains of a woolly rhinoceros, including an incomplete skull and lower jaw A virtually complete wolf skeleton Partial remains of hyena, horse, reindeer, mountain hare and red fox Bones of various small mammals such as bats and shrews. It is anticipated that further bones of small mammals will be identified during post-excavation laboratory analysis. Whether all of the creatures uncovered at Sherford coexisted or lived at different points over a much longer time span is uncertain. One theory is that some of the creatures fell into a pit and were unable to escape, and carnivorous scavengers followed and met a similar fate – or the animals died elsewhere and the bones washed into the area over a period of time. Understanding the range of mammals present, particularly herbivores, will also provide an insight into the plants that may have existed at the time. Danielle Schreve, professor of quaternary science at Royal Holloway University of London, was one of those who crawled into the cave to help supervise the recovery work. “It’s really extraordinary to go into a cave and find remains of things like woolly mammoth tusks,” she said. “It’s pretty special.” Schreve said it was probably the most significant find of its kind since the discovery of the Joint Mitnor cave in Devon more than 80 years ago. The animal bones and environmental samples have been recorded and removed from the ground and are undergoing academic analysis and conservation. It is expected that the full archive of remains will return to Devon, into the care of The Box, Plymouth’s revamped museum. Developers have said the area where the remains were found would be conserved and nothing would be built on top, but the entrance to the cave will be sealed. Rob Bourn, the managing director of Orion Heritage and lead archaeologist on the project for the Sherford Consortium, said: “This is a major discovery of national significance, a once in a lifetime experience for those involved. To find such an array of artefacts untouched for so long is a rare and special occurrence.” Bourn said the south-west of England was very different in the time of the mammoth. “It was an area where mammoths and other creatures thrived, roaming great distances across a landscape that looked very different to today, with glaciers not far away in south Wales and a volatile climate prone to huge floods.” Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “This discovery is exceptional. To have found partial remains of such a range of species here in Devon gives us a brilliant insight into the animals which roamed around ice age Britain thousands of years ago, as well as a better understanding of the environment and climate at the time.”",News/Science,Remains of woolly mammoth found on Devon building site,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/03/remains-of-woolly-mammoth-found-on-devon-building-site

2/3/2022,"Come on Pilgrim is the greatest debut album by anyone, ever. Discuss. mungoslut I will partially agree, at least to appear humble. But seeing as I’m not so humble … I was listening to Murmur by REM a lot just before Come on Pilgrim and that was hugely influential on me as a songwriter. I’m going to be cocky and say: we were even better than Murmur.  I’ve had many a pub argument where I defended my position that I’d take the Frank Black back catalogue over Pixies. Which are you most proud of? SpoctorDooner I suppose I’m most proud of the Pixies catalogue because that’s what I’m known for. I’m glad for the paradigm of an actual band where everything has to go through a strong filter with a certain amount of compromise and humility. That can be difficult to deal with when you’re a young, cocky rock musician and still an idiot. What was it like performing with David Bowie? alyslinn I was very nervous. There were all these other greats, like Robert Smith, Sonic Youth and Lou Reed, so I certainly felt the most junior. But Bowie and his band were very gracious and accommodating. It was his 50th, and what are you going to give someone like that for their birthday? So I re-recorded [Bowie track] Fashion, but using the original lyric, which I understood was “fascist”. My friend John Flansburgh from They Might Be Giants brought some musicians to a recording studio in New York the day I sang with Bowie. I burned two copies: one my ex-wife probably still has, and the other copy I gave to birthday boy. What’s the strangest thing you’ve ever seen? Porcinho I used to have this dog who was fixed, so it didn’t have any testicles. And I had this cat who was also fixed, so it didn’t have a lot of sexual energy. They’d hang out on my bed with me, and often, when I would wake up, the cat would be performing fellatio on the dog. It’s not necessarily what you want to see before you’ve had your morning coffee. I won’t tell you their names because I don’t want to embarrass them. They read all my press. No one in Pixies ever speaks during a concert – not even a thank you. What’s the thinking? thejungpretender I have nothing against people who talk between songs. I’m just not very good at it. You become very self-conscious when someone’s tuning their guitar or there’s a pause in the show. It makes you nervous, so you ramble and make stupid jokes into the microphone. I’d listen back to early recordings; most of the time you couldn’t understand what I was saying, and if you did understand, it was stupid, so I just felt like an idiot. Kim [Deal, former Pixies bassist] was much better at talking to the audience, but when we got back together, she fell out of habit. Now it’s a better psychological place for everybody: for me, for the show, for the reverence of music and the gathering of people. How do you manage to keep screaming night after night? Have you ever shot your voice? eightyseventh I used to blow it out a bit when I was younger, so I took singing lessons from an opera guy in LA, who taught me an old bel canto opera trick: to look like you’re delivering 100% while actually giving 40%. If you’re wearing an operatic Viking costume for four hours, that’s a long time to be belting it out. It’s the same in a rock band. I’ve learned how to hide the appearance of restraint. Please elaborate on the inspiration behind Monkey Gone to Heaven. Virke7 I guess it’s loosely inspired by the so-called human dilemma of existence, our existential problem on whether we can survive as a race. But it’s told without any agenda or judgment and mixes in some very loose biblical, sing-songy things because, you know, “The devil is six and God is seven” rhymes with heaven. It’s a nursery rhyme with mythological folk imagery. In oversimplified evolutionary terms, we are descended from apes and monkeys, so they are the animal we metaphorically most relate to because of this evolutionary kinship. So that’s why it’s not a bird or a fish gone to heaven. Do you believe in God? SimonBlackFromPoland Well, as my father used to reply to the same question: we could probably talk about that all day long.I’ve always been interested in the UFO imagery that pops up throughout your oeuvre. I remember an interview where you spoke about a UFO sighting on the American Great Plains when you were a kid.PeterSaucer The best reference I can give is a Frank Black and the Catholics B-side called Le Cigare Volant, which means flying cigar. There’s a delicious Californian wine called Le Cigare Volant, very similar to Châteauneuf-du-Pape – my favourite wine, although I don’t really drink any more. If you do drink, I recommend Le Cigare Volant from the north of Santa Barbara. Anyway: the flying cigar is the classic description of unidentified flying objects, and I did observe a flying cigar with my brother when we were quite young. It was broad daylight, very slow moving, very close to us and had no markings. I recount the story in more poetic terms in song. What would visitors from another planet make of your music? Kevink2000 I imagine they would probably deduce a lot of information about who I was as a specimen of my species. They’d figure out how old I am, what sex I am, probably my age. But I expect they might find the music a little more distressing. Have you discovered any music in the past few years that has really inspired you?PhilClements The new Sleaford Mods album that came out last year is really fucking great. I listen to that a lot. What’s your favourite album by the Fall? TheFall2007 I Am Kurious Oranj. I was fortunate to go to two of your Brixton Academy shows when you reformed Pixies in 2004 – perhaps the best atmosphere of any gig I have been to. What are your memories? radiofour The first memory that comes to mind is that we were going to do all of our big numbers, including Hey, but I wasn’t really convinced that I was playing the guitar riff correctly. Fortunately [Pixies guitarist] Joey Santiago’s brother Bob, who has performed with Pixies, was at the first show and said: “Yes, that’s because you’re playing it wrong,” and showed me how to play it. So I’m grateful to Bob for steering me on what was a potentially a small thing, but kind of a big thing too. Know any good jokes? eendean Here’s one I learned from my grandfather. What’s the difference between a duck? One leg is both the same. I don’t understand it either. What is a debaser? JonBroster I guess it means: one who debases. A debaser. It was an attempt to introduce a new word into the lexicon, but I don’t think it’s been successful, else I would have heard about it. Kim Deal once gave a 16-year-old me a pair of your shoes after a gig in 1989. Do you want them back? ismightier I appreciate the offer but they probably have value to the person who has them. They might be vintage by now! A Japanese clothing dealer once offered me $500 cash on the spot for my tennis shoes, but they had more value to me as a pair of shoes that day. You don’t walk around the big city in bare feet. I was like: “I need my shoes. Sorry.” Are you friends with Kim Deal or do you guys hate each other? POlskiBus I mean, we’re always friends. You don’t be in a band together and not be friends. I don’t recall when I last spoke to her, and I’m not very good at Christmas cards. We did a lot of tours together, we wrote together and we made all those records together … but nothing is for ever. You’re sort of damned if you do and damned if you don’t. If you don’t get back together, people say: “Oh, that’s a bit sad. What are your memories? What are your regrets?” And if you don’t break up and stay together, everyone says: “Oh, are you guys still together, doing that same old shtick?” Have you ever written a song that made you think: “How will I ever top that”? JamesDonnelly Oh, sure. Every time I write a song that I’m pleased with. I’ve put together about 40 songs for the current Pixies record. A couple of times I even surprised myself, but I think it’s a common experience in songwriting. You write something that you’re pleased with and your first thought is: “I just wrote the best song I ever wrote.” But to say “I’m never going to write another song that good” would be quite an epiphany, so I’m not inclined to make that kind of statement. Have you ever felt like saying: “Fuck this shit, I’m going to live in a cabin in the woods”? HomerGoetznutz Sure. We all have our fleeting thoughts of: I never want to do what I do all the time ever again. I think we mean well when we speak to ourselves in that way, but it’s easy to have these kinds of epiphanies that aren’t necessarily that accurate.Where is your mind? upyerbum The mind is less debated than the existence of soul. The mind seems to be finite, with a beginning, a middle and an end, and then it leaves ghosts and residue. The mind is not in your brain; it’s reported by your brain, so the notion is that it’s not actually your brain, but it’s not your soul or your so-called art either.

2/3/2022,"In their final conversation with counsellors, Sailor, who identified as non-binary, felt weighed down. The 14-year-old described the mass of emotions in them as growing by the day, and felt they had nowhere to turn for help. Their parents, Jason and Monika, struggle to get the words out when they think of their child feeling so alone. Despite a referral to the NHS a year before Sailor died, no official help or assessment took place. The teenager ended up taking their own life in September last year after visits to accident and emergency owing to self-harming.  “Our child was first referred by the school in October or November of 2020 and then later by a GP,” says Sailor’s mother, Monika. She says that at the end of June the family ended up in hospital after a particularly bad cutting incident that left them concerned. “The psychiatric nurses gave a safeguard plan which involved locking up sharp items. There was no mention of suicide,” Monika says, adding that in later calls with health experts exercise was suggested as a solution. Sailor’s parents hunted for solutions but private counsellors refused to take a child who self-harmed. “They were considered too high-risk and counsellors were worried about being sued if something bad happened … Both Jason and I over a period of months tried several times a week to get Sailor help and it was difficult. How hard can it be when you say you have a 14-year-old who is self-harming, has obsessive compulsive disorder and wants to identify as gender neutral. “If you cannot get help for a young person dealing with all these things, it’s not surprising what happened. But it is heartbreaking as Sailor’s death was so avoidable.” To get a quicker assessment, Jason and Monika would need to wait until “absolute crisis”, professionals said. Sailor’s mental health deteriorated over lockdown but Jason says he feels a lack of funding is no excuse for poor support. “If you are in an organisation that is cash-strapped then work out how to best serve the people you need to,” he says. Sailor struggled with school shutting and opening up and was more stable when at home. They were popular but their OCD symptoms could be triggered by going to school due to a lack of control. “The humanity of this whole thing gets lost. From the perspective of mental health services it’s another person on a list, and to triage a child you wait until someone tries to kill themselves. But at this stage there’s a 50/50 chance of saving their life and in Sailor’s case it was too late. Our child died.” Monika says Sailor was “not a difficult teenager” and was “not hard work”. “They were creative, artistic and musical. I am not saying this because they were our child, it’s true. Sailor was not demanding and difficult like teenagers can be. We never fought, and I am a hothead,” she says. The parents say it was hard to hear Sailor’s final comments. “Sailor was saying there was no one there to help them, and all Sailor wanted was to be taken seriously by a doctor or children’s services,” Jason says.

2/3/2022,"Children with mental health problems are dying because of failings in NHS treatment, coroners across England have said in what psychiatrists and campaigners have called “deeply concerning” findings. In the last five years coroners have issued reports to prevent future deaths in at least 14 cases in which under-18s have died while being treated by children’s and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).  The most common issues that arise are delays in treatment and a lack of support in helping patients transition to adult services when they turn 18. Coroners issue reports to prevent future deaths in extreme cases when it is decided that if changes are not made then another person could die. Dr Elaine Lockhart, the chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ faculty of child and adolescent psychiatry, said the findings were “deeply concerning” and every death was a tragedy. She said there were too often lengthy delays and services were under strain as demand rises and the NHS faces workforce shortages. “In child and adolescent mental health services in England, 15% of consultant psychiatrist posts are vacant,” Lockhart said, calling for more support, investment and planning to grow staff levels. Among the cases issued with reports to prevent future deaths were those of: Sky Rollings, who died four days after being admitted to hospital. Pressure was applied for her to be transferred after she turned 18 and no longer qualified for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Instead of receiving the standard six-month transition, the college student was given six weeks. Mary Bush, who was assessed three weeks later than she should have been. There was a delay in Mary receiving psychological therapy, and she was still on the waiting list at the time of her death aged 15. Sam Gould, 16, who took her own life in September 2018. A coroner said “systemic weaknesses and failings” in communication between healthcare agencies probably caused her death. Becky Romero, 15, who died at her home in Bristol. The coroner ruled she died as a direct consequence of neglect by the NHS, because the service that was supposed to help her did not have enough resources. Tom Madders, the director of communications and campaigns at the charity YoungMinds, said: “It goes without saying that when young people seek help for their mental health they should be looked after, kept safe and helped to get better.” Madders raised concerns over waiting times and a high threshold for treatment. “Some young people start to self-harm, drop out of school or become suicidal before they get help, and those who transition into adult services face a lack of support,” he said. He called for more investment and early intervention. Another recent case flagged by coroners was that of Ellis Murphy-Richards, 15, who killed himself shortly after walking out of a counselling session on 30 September 2020. Concluding the inquest last year, the coroner Sonia Hayes raised concerns about the care the transgender teenager received hours before his death. He had tried to take his own life the night before. Hayes sent a report to prevent future deaths criticising the fact that an NHS worker had had to deal with the situation alone and that a psychiatrist had deviated from a care plan. She said there was no contingency plan being in place to deal with a young person who refused help. Speaking to the Guardian, Ellis’s mother, Natasha Murphy, said her “honest mistake was trusting CAMHS”. She said she felt she would have managed to look after Ellis and protect him as she had over the previous few years. Murphy felt her son was not taken seriously. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Every loss of life is a tragedy and the impact on families can be devastating. We are committed to looking after children and young people’s mental health and ensuring they have access to safe, appropriate care.” The department said that through the NHS long-term plan it was providing an extra £2.3bn a year to expand mental health services, meaning 345,000 more children and young people would be helped by 2023-24.

2/3/2022,"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of contaminating faith in democracy by trying to “devalue the rules so they don’t matter to anyone any more”, and hit out at the government for being too preoccupied with party allegations to deal with a looming cost-of-living crisis. The Labour leader said ministers were “intent on saving themselves, not serving the country” and called out Johnson for making “repeated lies from the dispatch box”.  After it was revealed 12 gatherings in Downing Street and across Whitehall were being investigated by Scotland Yard, Starmer said No 10 was “in paralysis” and suggested he thought Johnson had knowingly broken strict Covid laws. The prime minister has said people should wait for the Met’s inquiries to conclude, but is under mounting pressure from Tory MPs who are continuing to submit no-confidence letters. In a speech on Thursday at Edelman, Starmer vowed that he would lead a Labour government that abided by the “Nolan principles”, seven key standards that holders of public office are already expected to observe: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. “I shouldn’t have to pledge to honour these principles but, sadly, I feel I do,” Starmer said. “It isn’t that the prime minister thinks the rules don’t apply. He absolutely knows that they do. “His strategy is to devalue the rules so they don’t matter to anyone any more. So that politics becomes contaminated. Cynicism and alienation replace confidence and trust. So that the taunt ‘politicians are just in it for themselves’ becomes accepted wisdom. “It is a strategy to sow disillusion; to convince people that things can’t get better, government can’t improve people’s lives, progress isn’t possible because politics doesn’t work. “But I’m not going to play the prime minister’s game. I simply refuse to accept that Britain can’t be governed better than this.” Starmer said he would not “simply shrug my shoulders at the dishonesty and disrespect on the basis that it is ‘priced in’” with Johnson. He also accused the prime minister of issuing “repeated lies from the dispatch box” in parliament – a statement MPs are usually unable to make from the Commons given the strict rules about not accusing someone else of deliberately misleading the house. It comes after Johnson vowed to fight on as prime minister and lead the Tories into the next election, which could be as late as 2024, suggesting he hoped to remain in post until 2029. However, a Conservative MP and former cabinet minister said Johnson had already lost the trust of “large parts of the population”. David Davis, an ex-Brexit secretary, told Times Radio: “The problem is the prime minister is losing or has lost the trust of a large part of the population, which is important for the administration of law, that people should follow what the government says, and so on.” Three further MPs announced publicly they had submitted no-confidence letters in Johnson on Thursday, meaning the numbers are gradually increasing toward the threshold of 54 needed to trigger a ballot on the prime minister’s premiership. Johnson has brushed off suggestions he attended any gatherings that constituted parties, though apologised earlier this week after the interim findings of a report were published by senior civil servant Sue Gray. Gray’s report has not been published in full because of the ongoing Met inquiry, but a brief “update” on her investigation criticised “failures of leadership and judgment” at the top of government. Johnson said he was “sorry for the things we simply did not get right and sorry for the way this matter has been handled” and that it was “no use” trying to argue whether events broke the rules or not because he understood “the anger that people feel”. He also spoke of reviewing the civil service and special adviser codes of conduct – but neglected to include the ministerial code.",News/Politics,"PM’s disregard for rules is damaging democracy, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/pms-disregard-for-rules-is-damaging-democracy-says-keir-starmer

That is an album that now feels redolent of a different age, worthy of nostalgic retrospective pieces on American music websites, hymning the “the pre-algorithm era of tastemaking guided by the prominence of MP3 blogs”: an era in which Animal Collective looked like they might cross over to mainstream acceptance. Certainly, the nature of its success suggested it was attracting attention far beyond its usual constituency: Beyoncé reworked a line from its standout single My Girls on her universally lauded album Lemonade.  While some of their peers grasped the opportunity (Kevin Parker of Tame Impala, whose similarly psychedelically inclined debut InnerSpeaker appeared in Merriweather Post Pavilion’s wake, has become a regular pop world fixture, collaborating with Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Mark Ronson) Animal Collective appeared to let the momentum dissipate. They worked on two films: the absolutely dreadful would-be arthouse flick ODDSAC and the rather pretty Tangerine Reef, which set their music to footage of marine life. The band’s members released eight solo albums between them. The follow-ups to Merriweather Post Pavilion, the cluttered Centipede Hz and 2016’s frantic and abrasive Painting With were more coolly received: Beyoncé has not, as yet, lifted anything from either of these. But then, Animal Collective always were adherents of the Grateful Dead – they sampled 1974’s Unbroken Chain on an EP released just after Merriweather Post Pavilion’s success; band member Dave “Avey Tare” Portner contributed vocals to Dead percussionist Mickey Hart’s 2017 solo album – and they seem to have decided Garcia and co’s way of doing things suited them too: operating at a slight remove from whatever else is happening in the music business, buoyed by a fanbase big on the FLAC file equivalent of live tape trading. For better or for worse, the sense of a band preaching to the choir permeates Time Skiffs. With its lyrical references to matters temporal (“why are we in such a rush?” wonders Car Keys; “I cut my pace, no more racing urges,” offers Strung With Everything, “how many days do we have?”; while on Prester John, even the sight of a dried-up leaf leads the narrator to consider it had “a good long run, with a world of good intentions by it”) it often feels like it’s addressing an audience who have been with Animal Collective for many years: noughties hipsters now staring down the barrel of middle age and grappling with the realisation that one’s time on Earth isn’t as limitless as it once seemed. Even Walker, a eulogy for the late Scott Walker stirs Animal Collective’s own mortality into the mix: “Appreciate you cannot wait … we’ll see you out there”. Musically, there are lovely tunes – particularly the lazily gliding closer Royal and Desire – but there’s little of the head-turning WTF factor that marked out Merriweather Post Pavillion, or its predecessor Strawberry Jam, and nothing resembling a breakout hit along the lines of My Girls. There’s still a lot of cavernous echo applied to everything, but the sound feels relatively stripped back – the heady, enveloping psychedelic swirl of those albums is absent. On the plus side, so is Painting With’s spectacularly irritating trademark vocal style, in which Portner and Noah “Panda Bear” Lennox duetted by singing not alternating words, but alternating syllables of each word. In fact, the sonic mood often feels less psychedelic than strangely New Age-y, sounds associated with a genre that appealed to hippies who had outgrown the lysergic mayhem of their youth floating over Lennox’s rolling drum patters: keyboard riffs that twinkle like light on water; noises that recall gamelan instruments or things made of bamboo being struck with beaters, or – on the intro to Cherokee – some kind of hammered dulcimer; the minute of ambient synth, flickers of pedal steel guitar and what sounds like clanking wind chimes that opens Strung With Everything. Time Skiffs isn’t a straightforward album by most artists’ standards: that its patchworks of sound, lengthy instrumental interludes and slowly uncoiling song structures represent Animal Collective dialling things down says more about their past oeuvre than anything else. As it is, it feels like an act of quiet consolidation rather than a breakthrough, aimed squarely at existing fans, unbothered by grabbing anyone else’s attention. “How are we doing now?” asks Car Keys, over and over again, as if checking in on an old friend, a line that sums up both Time Skiffs’ limitations and its charm. Arlo Parks – SoftlySoftly isn’t a huge leap forward from Parks’ debut album, but it’s lovely nonetheless: a breakup song that’s oddly buoyant and uplifting.",Arts/Music,Animal Collective: Time Skiffs review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/animal-collective-time-skiffs-album-review
