4/15/2022,"Aviation is the most climate-intensive form of transport, so for the sake of the planet, will we have to quit flying for ever? I asked Professor Pericles Pilidis from the Centre for Propulsion Engineering at Cranfield University whether the promise of hydrogen planes could keep our holiday hopes alive. Thanks for joining me on Zoom, Pericles. Is that a plane you have as your background?Yes! It’s a hydrogen aeroplane. Is that the one that had its successful maiden voyage in 2020, but then crashed in 2021?No, this one doesn’t exist yet but is based on detailed analysis. It looks just like a regular passenger plane. How do hydrogen planes work?They look the same but inside they’ll be very different. Currently, planes use hydrocarbon fuel. When it burns, carbon dioxide is produced, which increases global warming. But with hydrogen, you are only producing water. About 3% of the carbon humans produce comes from aviation. By humans, though, we’re really talking about people in the west.Yes, but there are global benefits to aviation. I’ve just come back from a holiday in Barbados where roughly half the economy is tourism. If people stop flying, it won’t affect Britons much, but it will have a horrific economic impact in Barbados. Don’t get me wrong, I love travelling! I think there’s a reason people say someone is “worldly” as a compliment – it’s wonderful to experience other cultures. So how long until hydrogen can give us guilt-free wings?I’d say 10 years. The problem is that hydrogen costs three to four times the price of conventional fuels. Plus, airports will have to change, because transporting hydrogen is not easy, and aircraft designs will change, too. We don’t have the rules around safety qualifications for these planes – that needs to be developed. It’ll all cost billions, and we need to do it all without using fossil fuels. There’s no point using oil to produce hydrogen. Yet all these things can be done. We’ve been making aircraft safe for 120 years: we can make hydrogen aircraft safe in 10. We just need a lot of money. Wow! I’m guessing these costs will be passed down to the consumer.I’d expect some to be, yes. But wouldn’t that be temporary? A century ago only the wealthiest could have cars. Now everyone does. New technology usually becomes cheaperIf the political will is there, yes. This is somewhere national investments should come in. The UK government is spending £100bn on HS2. That’s the sort of money we need. It sounds like a lot but it’s not dissimilar to what the government’s already doing. I won’t hold my breath for such political will. They can’t even nationalise the trains even though it makes financial sense and would be popular.I’m not advocating nationalisation, but supporting private industry, like with wind and solar energy. Grants brought the cost of solar panels down, so it’s now a few per cent of what it used to be. But it’s still private companies making this happen. The difference with aerospace is that instead of buying from Germany or China like we do with solar panels, we can actually produce the engines. That’s British jobs being created. Sounds quite good, doesn’t it?It’s like having your cake and eating it, but before you can have your cake or eat it, you need to buy it first.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Do we need to stop flying to save the planet?

4/15/2022,"Companies owned by the billionaire Richard Desmond have launched legal action against the UK’s gambling regulator’s decision to grant Czech-owned Allwyn the licence to run the National Lottery. Desmond’s Northern & Shell and a subsidiary, the New Lottery Company, have taken legal action against the Gambling Commission, according to a high court filing dated 13 April – becoming the third party to challenge the award. The commission announced Allwyn’s victory in the fourth competition for the highly lucrative National Lottery contract last month, putting an end to 27 years of unbroken operation by Camelot. Camelot made a net income of £730m in the year to March 2021 on revenues of £8.4bn from almost 10m players. The current licence is scheduled to end in 2024, 30 years since the launch of the lottery in 1994. However, Camelot, owned by a pension fund for Ontario teachers and its tech provider International Game Technology, have also launched high court actions to try to overturn the commission’s decision. The competition was shrouded in secrecy, with code names used internally by the commission to prevent details of the judging process leaking. Northern & Shell, which owns the Health Lottery, had not previously made its bid public, and there are no other publicly available details of the former porn baron’s procurement claim. The claimants are represented by law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, in a case first reported by the Financial Times. Another bidder, Italian operator Sisal, which was bought during the competition by Paddy Power owner Flutter, is also considering joining Camelot’s action, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The Gambling Commission declined to comment on Northern & Shell’s action. When Camelot announced its action on 1 April the commission said: “The competition and our evaluation have been carried out fairly and lawfully in accordance with our statutory duties, and we are confident that a court would come to that conclusion.” Allwyn is ultimately owned by the Czech billionaire Karel Komárek, and it already runs lotteries in the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, and Austria. It hired prominent British businessmen to run its bid, including Sir Keith Mills, who ran London’s winning bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, and former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King. After winning the contract competition, Allwyn said it planned “to generate more money for good causes and the public purse” as well as stopping the “slide towards scratchcards and instant win games, giving due consideration to the wider societal impact these can have”. It also said Camelot employees would “all be welcome to join us”. Camelot employs 1,000 people in Watford. Allwyn and Northern & Shell were approached for comment.",News/UK news,National lottery: Richard Desmond takes legal action over licence award ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/national-lottery-richard-desmond-takes-legal-action-over-licence-award
4/15/2022,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is monitoring growing cases of hepatitis in children across the UK after six had to undergo liver transplants. The medical watchdog was told about 10 cases of severe acute hepatitis in children in Scotland on 5 April. Three days later, it was notified of a further 74 cases in the rest of the UK. More cases are likely to be reported in the coming days. As of 11 April, no deaths from hepatitis – inflammation of the liver – had been recorded, though some children had been transferred to specialist liver units. One epidemiologically linked case has been detected, which means a patient has had contact with one or more people who either have or had the disease, or have been exposed to a point source of infection. Dr Meera Chand, the director of clinical and emerging infections at the UK Health Security Agency, said officials were working across the four nations to “investigate a wide range of possible factors which may be causing children to be admitted to hospital with liver inflammation known as hepatitis”. “One of the possible causes that we are investigating is that this is linked to adenovirus infection,” she said. “However, we are thoroughly investigating other potential causes.” Other explanations being investigated include whether or not Covid-19 could have played a role in the unusual spate of cases. Officials stressed there was “no link” between the cases and the Covid-19 vaccine, as none of the children affected by hepatitis had received a jab. According to the WHO, lab tests have excluded the usual viruses that cause hepatitis. The organisation awaits the results of further tests for infections, chemicals and toxins. Giving advice on preventing any potential spread of hepatitis between children, Dr Chand said: “Normal hygiene measures such as good handwashing, including supervising children, and respiratory hygiene, help to reduce the spread of many of the infections that we are investigating. “We are also calling on parents and guardians to be alert to the signs of hepatitis, including jaundice, and to contact a healthcare professional if they are concerned.” There have been 49 cases in England, 13 in Scotland and 12 across Wales and Northern Ireland since January. Since its identification in the UK, fewer than five cases have been reported in Ireland with further investigations ongoing. Three cases of acute hepatitis have been reported in children in Spain.",News/Society,WHO monitors rise in cases of hepatitis in children across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/15/who-monitors-rise-in-cases-of-hepatitis-in-children-across-uk
4/15/2022,"High fuel prices and shortages at the pumps continue to affect motorists, with those in rural areas with poor transport links hit particularly hard. They come amid a wave of protests by environmental activists blockading fuel distribution terminals. A spokesperson for the UK Petroleum Industry Association sought to minimise the impact of the protests, describing the disruptions as “localised and short-term only”. Three people speak about how fuel shortages and rising prices at the pumps are affecting them. Diesel shortages have forced 65-year-old Robin Hunter, who runs a national car delivery service in Lincolnshire, to stop booking jobs for the first time in more than two decades in the business. “I’ve never had to cancel work before because I can’t get hold of [fuel]. I’ve always managed to muddle through,” he says. He doesn’t want to risk booking jobs, saying he “doesn’t know when the situation will get better”: he visited five local supermarkets at the weekend trying to get diesel, to no avail. “It was a bit of a job getting the last tank on Friday,” he says. “I daren’t go any distance – I was meant to go to Bedfordshire. With half a tank I’d get there, but would I get back? Or risk getting stuck in a compromising position on the side of the road? I may have a valuable car on board, which you can’t leave unattended.” Hunter has also noticed the price of diesel increasing. He paid £1.86 per litre for diesel last Friday, when he drove 300 miles moving four cars. “I managed to find fuel at the local garage in the next village to me. I tried supermarkets first because the price is more competitive,” he says, adding that he paid £1.49 at Sainsbury’s last month. “Diesel is used by working people – lorries, vans, agriculture. The issue highlights how many diesel vehicles there are on the road.” Liam Hargadon, a 62-year-old part-time teacher living near Luton, has also noticed that finding diesel locally has become a challenge. “It’s very difficult to get diesel in Luton’,” he says, adding that the situation “seems to have gone crazy” in the past week. “A week or 10 days ago it was OK, then we [started] seeing tweets and Facebook posts from my local community saying there’s nothing available.” Hargadon, who teaches three days a week in High Barnet, drives 24 miles to work as his village has poor transport links. “We get four buses a day in the village and if I were to use public transport it would take over two hours each way,” he says. “And that would be if all the transport links were working perfectly.” In the past six months, he’s also been affected by considerable increases in diesel prices. He says he used to spend about £60 a month on diesel; now it’s £100. Diesel at his local petrol station fell to about £1.70 after the chancellor’s mini-budget in March, when Rishi Sunak cut fuel duty by 5p a litre. “Now it’s back up to £1.73, so I think the 5p/litre thing has been eroded,” he says. In order to maximise efficiency, the 62-year-old tries to combine tasks when using his car. “I try to ensure that each journey covers two or more tasks.” he says. Although he’s always tried to do this for environmental reasons, he’s become “very conscious” of it now. “I don’t go and fill up just for the sake of filling up – I may as well first go shopping and then fill up, to try and kill two or three birds with the same stone.” High fuel prices mean Samantha Button, a 31-year-old housing officer in Yorkshire, is having to cut down her visits to her grandad, who is unwell. “Normally I visit my grandparents every weekend. He’s quite ill, so I try to make the most of the time we have. The 50-mile round trip didn’t used to be much of an issue before”, she says. “You don’t want to have to choose between family and cost, but I can see soon I’m going to have to cut down how often I go.” The cost of filling up started to be a problem last month, Button says. “It didn’t used to be an issue – now you fill up and it’s a lot harder to make it to payday,” she says. “When you’ve got it in your account, you fill up and worry about cutting back later. Now it’s stark: you look at your bank balance and think there’s not much there. I’ve managed to make do by cutting back on food.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘I daren’t go any distance’: how are people coping with UK fuel shortages?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/15/i-darent-go-any-distance-how-are-people-coping-with-uk-fuel-shortages
4/15/2022,"Russia says it has struck what it described as a factory in Kyiv that makes and repairs anti-ship missiles, in apparent retaliation to the sinking of its Black Sea flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva. Russia acknowledged that the ship had sunk late on Thursday, but won’t confirm Ukraine’s claim that it was hit by missiles. Instead it says an unexplained fire caused ammunition to explode, and that the boat capsized “in choppy seas” while being towed to port. Read more: what we know and don’t know about the sinking of the Moskva. The Moskva was the pride of Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war in Ukraine, making it both a symbolic and military target. Satellite images show the cruiser north-west of Sevastapol on 10 April … … and docked in port at Sevastopol on 7 April. The Russian navy has launched cruise missiles into Ukraine and its activities in the Black Sea are crucial to supporting land operations in the south of the country, where it is battling to seize full control of the port of Mariupol. Ukraine said on Friday that for the first time since the start of its invasion, Russia used long-range bombers to attack the city, where surrounded Ukrainian forces are still holding out in the Azovstal iron and steelworks. On Thursday, Russia said it would deploy nuclear weapons to the Baltic if Finland and Sweden joined Nato. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/15/2022,"In Mike Bartlett’s rambunctious, modern-day Restoration comedy, there are scripted instructions that “everything should be joyful and fun”. Under the direction of Rachel O’Riordan, Scandaltown is a springtime pantomime of sorts, in which the classic features of 18th-century restoration dramas are re-spun with knowing humour, smut, silliness and arch references to the hypocrisies of the state, although the political satire in itself isn’t sharp enough to sting. There is much delight in the spoofing of its genre: the typically revealing names, from Matt Eton (Richard Goulding), a repressed Etonian and Tory politician, to the conspicuously marginal character, Freddie Peripheral (Luke Hornsby). The classic restoration drama traits are all entertainingly over-egged, from disguises and comic asides to period language (whence, thereof, t’was), and the obligatory showdown when secret paternities are revealed and grudges unburdened. In its best moments it has the look of an expensively produced Monty Python sketch with pastiche that really is joyous. But it gets baggier as it goes on and by the end begins to resemble a flabby ITV comedy with rather too predictable jokes on Tory politicians, their partying and policies over the pandemic. Eton, the secretary of state for procurement with a Daily Mail columnist wife (Emma Cunniffe), has a heavy-handed, albeit amusing, resemblance to a prominent Conservative politician. The topical satire jibes at privileged media types, too, but the snarkiest broadsides are reserved for the millennial generation, which here spouts sanctimonious statements on climate change and capitalism. One among them is Jack Virtue (Matthew Broome), who turns against fellow millennials and their “tyranny of virtue” to become something of a Byronic rake. Just as in Bartlett’s Love Love Love, the generations are in battle; those who grew up in the 1990s are dismissed by younger characters as the “disgusting generation” of selfish, greedy porn lovers. The older lot, in turn, pillory them for their exhibitionist virtue signalling, Twitter activism and veganism. Rachael Stirling as Lady Susan Climber first appears on stage draped across a chaise longue in a fabulous basque and gold suit (Kinnetia Isidore’s wardrobe is uniformly phenomenal along with Good Teeth’s opulent set), her butler swiping her dating app for her. She is sparky in her central part, alongside a cast that is brilliant across the board. However, the pace and wit sag after the interval, the final revelations are not dynamic enough and the mystery around an offensive outfit worn by Lady Climber has no payoff. In its story it contains shades of Henry Fielding’s Bildungsroman, Tom Jones, which was recently adapted into the musical What’s New Pussycat? but that show was far more effective in its comic revelations, twists and pacing. Still, there is fun and fine acting along the way and as Bartlett instructs, it is all joyfully silly stuff.

4/15/2022,"It is conceivable that by the end of the year Nato’s land mass, GDP and territorial borders with Russia may expand by nearly as much as they would have if Ukraine had achieved its distant goal of eventual membership of the western defence alliance – if not more. The brutal manner in which Vladimir Putin has tried to foreclose Ukraine’s security options has led to a sudden change in thinking in Finland and Sweden that has been all the more powerful since it seems to have come from below, as opposed to from the political elites. It is not yet a done deal. Opinion so volatile, and previously so settled in its opposition to Nato membership, could swing back towards the comforts of semi-neutrality. Russian nuclear threats, already starting, may intimidate voters into having second thoughts. The process may be fraught. Many brands of Nato membership exist, and have yet to be fully explored by the Finns and the Swedes. But by Nato’s Madrid summit in June, Nato will be on course to expand its population by 16 million, its GDP by €800bn and its land mass by 780,000m sq km. Ukraine, by contrast, has a population of 41 million, a land mass of 603,000m sq km and a GDP of €155bn. A new 1,300km border with Nato could be formed, the precise opposite of what Putin set out to achieve in the treaties designed to shrink Nato that he ordered the west to accept last year. What is worse for Moscow, Nato could have strengthened itself in the Baltic Sea, right next to Kalingrad enclave, the strategic Russian naval base. By invading Ukraine, Putin thought he had hurled a missile at the west. It has emerged to be a precision-guided boomerang. To have turned two stolidly non-aligned countries into Nato members would join the pantheon of great strategic blunders of wartime. It is all the more extraordinary since the turnaround has been so rapid. Finland, with its brand of semi-neutrality for the past 70 years and emphasis on consensus-building, tends to shift foreign policy with glacial speed. Finland’s tolerance of Putin was so embedded that some on the left claimed it strayed close to collaboration as the Finnish political elite shunned the Russian opposition. In the government’s annual survey in December, Finnish support for Nato membership stood at 24%. Four months later, Finnish politics has somersaulted. Support for Nato membership stood at 68%. Surveys now show more than half of the 200 parliamentarians back Nato membership. In the 2015 Finnish parliamentary elections, 91% of SDP candidates were opposed to Nato membership. The Finnish SDP prime minister, Sanna Marin, said everything had changed. Russia is “not the neighbour we thought it was”, she said. Alexander Stubb, a former Finnish prime minister, said Finland’s membership is based on rational fear, created on the day of the Russian invasion. He predicts the Finnish application will be with Nato HQ by the end of May. “The train has left the station.” In a speech earlier this month to the council of the largely agrarian Centre party, Annika Saarikko explained that sometimes history moved fast, measured in weeks rather than years: “In the foreseeable future we cannot rely on a mutually agreed to international order or a functioning relationship with Russia for our security.” She added that Nato membership came with obligations. “Finland would not just be buying some fire insurance. It would be joining the central fire brigade.” Such has been the Finnish turnaround, it has adopted the unusual role of exemplar to the larger Sweden. That requires the two countries respecting the relationship, sensitivities, and different political cultures. The ideal from Nato’s perspective is that the two countries join simultaneously, and polls show support for this. But Finnish diplomats say they cannot be seen to be interfering in sovereign Swedish decisions. Marin stressed at her joint press conference in Stockholm with the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, that coordination with Sweden “is sought but is not a prerequisite”, adding: “Finland does not dictate schedules or conclusions to Sweden nor does Sweden dictate to Finland.” It is vital for the ruling Social Democrats, now launching an internal policy review, to be seen to be in charge of its own destiny. After all, last November the party had clearly affirmed its position that it opposed a foreign policy of alliances. Yet four centre-right parties now support Nato membership and two parties to the left are opposed to membership, claiming joining Nato implies coming to the defence of the authoritarians running Turkey and Hungary. With parliamentary elections looming in September, the SDP will want the review completed without the party descending into left-right splits. One of the difficulties is that given Russia’s behaviour, no plan B such as greater Swedish-Finnish defence cooperation, or the Nato partnership for peace, looks as concrete as full membership. Most Nato countries see Sweden and Finland as huge military and intelligence assets. “It would complete a missing piece of the puzzle of Nato strategic planning”, said Mika Aaltola, the director of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. But Finland would have to apply for Nato membership not knowing the precise future relationship. In its security document published this week, Finland insisted: “Membership would not oblige Finland to accept nuclear weapons, permanent bases or troops in its territory. For example, in the early stages of their membership, founding members Norway and Denmark imposed unilateral restrictions on their membership and have not permitted permanent troops, bases or nuclear weapons of the alliance in their territory during peacetime. Nato’s enlargement policy, which took shape in the latter half of the 1990s, has been based on the principle that it will not place nuclear weapons, permanent troops or permanent bases in the territory of any new member country. But if Finland, or indeed Sweden, did set a mass of limiting preconditions concerning nuclear weapons, permanent bases or forces, the application process might be extended. A lengthy accession process in turn carries risks since Russia, using the full spectrum of war’s grey zone, will seek to harass, and even paralyse. On the day the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke to the Finnish parliament, Russia was accused of cyber-attacks and invasions of its airspace. Finland has already canvassed Nato members for security guarantees in the four months to a year that it was in the Nato ante-chamber awaiting full acceptance. So there is an incentive to speed the application without delegitimising the domestic consultation. For those who fear Nato escalating the conflict inside Ukraine, a sudden extension of article 5 obligations in the north remains alarming, and may make Putin even more convinced he was right to confront a Nato policy of encirclement. But for all its talk of red lines and the stationing of nuclear weapons, can Russia really open a second front to the north when the primary front to its south-west is proving so costly in lost lives, reputation and treasure?",News/World news,Putin thought Ukraine war was a missile to Nato.

Two anti-Glazer banners were displayed and the crowd of about 30 people dispersed approximately half an hour before Ralf Rangnick held his weekly Friday media briefing at 1.15pm. The gathering comes before a planned protest on Saturday outside Old Trafford when the team host Norwich City. Asked about the protest Rangnick said: “We all know football is a game of passion and emotions. We can all understand – I can understand our supporters are disappointed with our standing in the table and the performance we showed at Everton [losing 1-0], at least after we conceded that first goal. “But I still believe our supporters are one of the best, if not the best, in England and as long as they protest in a peaceful way and support the team in the stadium, they have a right to express their opinion.” Organisers of Saturday’s demonstration have called for participants not to enter Old Trafford until 3.17pm – to represent a minute for every year since Malcolm Glazer purchased the the club. A United spokesperson said: “There was a small and peaceful protest outside the Carrington training ground today. We respect the opinions of fans and remain committed to strengthening our engagement with them.” Luke Shaw is unlikely to play again this season because of complications relating to ongoing treatment for the double leg fracture the defender suffered against PSV Eindhoven in 2015. “As it seems, he will be out for at least another four or five weeks,” Rangnick said. “It will be difficult for him to be available for the remaining seven games.” Fred, Scott McTominay, Edinson Cavani and Raphaël Varane are also injured.",Sport/Football,Manchester United fans hold anti-Glazer protest at training ground,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/manchester-united-fans-hold-anti-glazer-protest-at-training-ground

Wealth erodes difference, and celebrity trumps wealth, but still, one wonders what the Peltz family make of the Beckhams – Peltz’s father, Nelson, in particular. Brooklyn Beckham’s new father-in-law is a 79-year-old businessman and fund manager, who made his billion-dollar fortune acquiring and running companies. (He used to own Snapple.) It is hard to imagine where, exactly, small talk with the father of the groom might have landed, particularly in light of Beckham Sr’s limitations. Perhaps they talked about Victoria Beckham’s fashion brand, approaching its 10th year of annual losses, or maybe Beckham explained to Peltz Sr, once again, that he really is a big deal (outside America). The guest list included a certain stripe of British celebrity encapsulated entirely by the words “Gordon Ramsay”. And there I should have cut myself off. But it was a slow Monday, and from the wedding photos in Vogue it was a swift downward spiral to Brooklyn’s Instagram, where – there’s no excuse for this – I watched several videos, one of which featured him teaching a friend how to make a pecan pie, in his new guise as a chef. He was quite sweet, I think? It was hard to tell. Brooklyn squinted at the camera, looked mildly confused, and said things like: “That’s the thing about being a chef – always messy.” As an entertainer, he seemed disinclined to go much further than the standing and squinting, and one looks forward with anticipation to the career after this. After launching last Wednesday, Netflix’s two-part documentary on Jimmy Savile gained traction this week and proved to be another great advertisement for public ownership of Channel 4, a much better maker of documentaries than the streaming giant. This one was very long, not very original and, per the subtitle – A British Horror Story – clearly intended for American audiences, many of whom went on Twitter to voice their astonishment. For Brits it was an interesting moment of seeing ourselves through others’ eyes. Harder to explain to Americans than how Savile got away with his crimes for so long was the nature of his appeal in the first place. Here the documentary, light on victim testimony, heavy on bio, was somewhat useful, airing clip after clip of the man in his prime: that kiss-me-quick, end-of-the-pier burlesque that draws down into all sorts of British figures, from George Formby to Jimmy Krankie. Tactically, it was brilliant, a style thought incommensurate with adult sexuality, let alone predation. Whenever Savile said something jokey – “my case comes up next Thursday” – the camera lingered on his face to catch what appeared, in hindsight, to be a reptilian movement of the eyes. But that’s a point to make in three minutes, not three hours. For the last five years, I have watched the construction of Steinway Tower through my window, inching up floor by floor to its final height of almost 1,500ft – a quarter of a mile into the air – and, with a height-to-width ratio of 24:1, officially the world’s skinniest skyscraper. This week new residents were invited to move in and start experiencing Steinway’s special “sway” for themselves. As with other ultra-tall buildings in the city, you can apparently feel the place move in high winds, which pretty much guarantees I wouldn’t pay five bucks to live there, let alone $66m for the triplex. Downtown, residents of another Manhattan skyscraper were having bigger problems. Residents of 20 Exchange Place have, since Christmas, been hit with regular elevator outages to the upper part of the building, all the way to the 59th floor. Once a week I force myself to take the stairs to the 13th floor and am rendered non-functional for about 20 minutes. I can only imagine how the nurse quoted in the New York Times, faced with a 48-floor hike after a 12-hour shift, managed to haul herself home. The building management blames the problem on Con Ed, the energy provider, for failing to fix “surges” that it says keep knocking out the elevator banks, and Con Ed blames the building. All of which sounds terrible enough, but it gets worse. The Times reported that on occasion when residents are finally able to board an elevator, they have logged bumpy rides and “faster-than-usual descents”. My next home will be a bungalow. David Mamet, the once great playwright, continues his commitment to going the full David Icke with a comment made to Fox News this week that “teachers are inclined – particularly men, because men are predators – to paedophilia.” It came up in a discussion around Florida’s so-called “don’t say gay” law, but doesn’t stand out among Mamet’s recent public pronouncements, including his assessment of Donald Trump. In a recent essay collection, Mamet described him as someone who “speaks American, and those of us who also love the language are awed and delighted to hear it from an elected official.” Praising Trump for his language skills sounds like a trick question on a cognitive test for early signs of dementia, of a kind the former president loves to boast about passing. Anyway, Mamet still has a friend in the Wall Street Journal, a stablemate of Fox News, which after his most recent burblings stated admiringly that the Pulitzer prize winner “won’t play along with woke signalling”. It’s hard to let “coffee is for closers” go, but I guess now would be a good time to stop quoting him. It’s Good Friday and I’m doing what God intended for the Easter weekend, which is forcing my children to watch back-to-back golden age musicals until they climb the walls and howl for mercy. This is payback for them complaining about musical theatre at their after-school club last week – learning Edelweiss apparently finished them off – and begging me to switch them to yoga. Anyway, I may have let them drop out of class, but they’re not off the hook. We’re starting with Oliver!, moving on to Gigi, and working our way up to Easter Parade, which is under two hours long but will feel to them more like five. As they love to say to each other when fighting, and in the spirit of Good Friday: that’s what you get.",News/UK news,Digested week: a downward spiral from Vogue to Brooklyn Beckham’s Instagram | Emma Brockes,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/digested-week-a-downward-spiral-from-vogue-to-brooklyn-beckhams-instagram
