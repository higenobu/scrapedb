3/3/2022,"A cargo of oil from Russia is en route to a British port where it is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday evening, due to a loophole in the ban imposed this week by the government in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Department for Transport said on Tuesday it had implemented a ban closing British ports to all ships that are Russian-owned, operated, controlled, chartered, registered or flagged. However, the department has confirmed that the prohibition does not cover the origin of the cargo. On Tuesday, as the law was being passed, the Pluto was moored at Milford Haven in south Wales and was scheduled to dock next in Derry, Northern Ireland. According to the ship tracking website Marine Traffic, the 184m-long Pluto was under way in the Irish Sea on Wednesday afternoon, with a scheduled arrival time at the city’s docks, known as Foyle Port, at 8pm. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists.

The Guardian understands that Foyle Port expects to receive the vessel and does not believe that the measures brought in by the DfT cover the Pluto. The vessel is bringing crude oil from Primorsk terminal, near St Petersburg, which accounts for 30% of oil exports from the country. The Guardian has approached Foyle Port for comment. On Monday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, wrote: “The maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia’s economic interests and holding the Russian government to account. “In these circumstances the Department for Transport does not consider it appropriate for Russian vessels to continue to enter UK ports.” The Pluto is registered with the Marshall Islands and flies the Pacific archipelago’s flag.",News/World news,Tanker with oil from Russia slips through loophole in UK ban,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/pluto-tanker-oil-russia-uk-ban-loophole
3/3/2022,"The governor of Montana, Greg Gianforte, shot and killed a mountain lion that was being monitored by national park staff after hunting the animal with hounds and chasing it up a tree. The Republican governor hunted the lion on 28 December, according to details first reported by the Washington Post that were confirmed on Monday by Gianforte’s press secretary, Brooke Stroyke. Stroyke said the governor had a valid hunting license, drove the lion up the tree, and shot it. “The governor and friends tracked the lion on public lands,” said Stroyke in a statement emailed to the Post. “As the group got closer to the lion, members of the group, who have a hound training license, used four hounds to tree the lion once the track was discovered in a creek bottom on public land.” Stroyke also said that once the mountain lion was in the tree, Gianforte confirmed it was male, “harvested it, and put his tag on it”. “He immediately called to report the legal harvest and then the [Montana fish, wildlife and parks] game warden. In Livingston, the governor met the game warden who tagged the lion and took the collar.” The hunt happened on public US Forest Service land located south-west of Emigrant, Montana, according to residents familiar with the hunting episode who spoke anonymously to preserve community ties, reported the Post. The five-year-old mountain lion was being monitored by Yellowstone national park staff via a GPS collar and was known to park biologists as M220. The mountain lion hunt is not Gianforte’s first time hunting monitored wildlife. In February 2021, Gianforte killed a collared wolf 10 miles outside Yellowstone national park that was similarly tracked by national park staff and known as 1155. The wolf hunt was a violation of state rules as Gianforte did not complete a mandatory trapping class beforehand. Conservationists have remained outraged at Gianforte’s personal hunting of monitored wildlife and support of controversial pro-hunting laws passed last year in Montana, including an ordinance that directed a decrease in Montana’s wolf population and allowed hunters to kill wolves located just outside Yellowstone’s boundaries. “The consequences are severe for wolves,” said Dan Wenk, Yellowstone national park superintendent from 2011 to 2019. In just the past six months, a record 25 Yellowstone wolves were killed, 19 from Montana. While federal law bans hunting in Yellowstone, animals who migrate off park grounds are often killed by hunters. Almost 190 bison were killed during the 2020-21 winter season after wandering outside of the park’s boundaries in Montana.",News/US news,Montana governor kills mountain lion being monitored by national park staff,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/02/montana-governor-kills-mountain-lion-greg-gianforte
3/3/2022,"The Scottish government’s long-awaited bill to simplify how people legally change the sex on their birth certificate is finally published on Thursday. Since Nicola Sturgeon first mooted the changes to obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC) in 2016, this reform and associated legislation on the census, hate crime and the right of rape victims to request the sex of their medical examiner, have resulted in the most significant revolts of her premiership. Proponents of the reforms – which include removing the requirement for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria – hope they will streamline a process that transgender people find intrusive and distressing, but will not affect the spaces or services they use in their day-to-day lives. Critics argue that the simplification – known as self-identification – will fundamentally alter who can access women-only services and that the planned changes are already prompting an unwelcome policy shift, for example in single-sex wards. On Thursday, Shona Robison, the cabinet secretary responsible, will make a parliamentary statement to launch the bill, not usual procedure and a reflection of the fraught context of reform. Campaigners, advisers and politicians have told the Guardian they believe that delays to the bill have created a vacuum in which a toxic discourse has taken hold, damaging trust between the Scottish National party and the LGBT+ community that will take more than the success of this legislation to repair. In advance of publication, MSPs describe an atmosphere of trepidation, with supporters and critics fearing a “nasty” and “febrile” debate in Holyrood. Within the SNP, finance secretary Kate Forbes – a member of the socially conservative Free Church of Scotland – is the most senior politician to express concerns. It is understood that critical voices hold less sway throughout the party after a number left to join Alex Salmond’s Alba party, which has been accused of weaponising the reform against the SNP, although there is also deep disappointment within other sections of the party at the way alleged transphobia has been handled internally. A handful of SNP rebels are reported to be pressing for a free vote on this bill, as there was for same-sex marriage in 2014, and there are wider concerns that public uncertainty about the proposals could lose votes in May’s council elections. The reform was a non-negotiable aspect of the Scottish Greens partnership deal with the SNP, while the Scottish Lib Dems are likewise strongly in support, the Scottish Labour group is understood to be largely in favour and Scottish Conservatives largely against. While advocates calculate the overall arithmetic for the bill there remain concerns that some critics have not yet taken a public stance, and complaints there has not been enough internal discussion within parties. Those hopeful of a respectful debate praise the all party LGBT+ group led by the Conservatives’ Jamie Greene and the SNP’s Emma Roddick for brokering informal conversations. Vic Valentine of Scottish Trans Alliance said the time taken to implement reform had been “frustrating and harmful”, while another experienced LGBT+ campaigner Blair Anderson, explained: “Scotland has become the lightening rod because reform has been shelved elsewhere.” The UK government dropped plans for self-identification two years ago. Last week, Scotland’s highest court approved the decision by the government agency running this month’s census to allow any transgender person to self-identify as their lived sex – following a challenge by Fair Play for Women, which overturned similar guidance in England and Wales. The Guardian has spoken to a number of transgender Scots about the current process of acquiring a gender recognition certificate, which requires an individual to have lived in their preferred gender for two years and evidence of a medical diagnosis. One described the “demeaning” experience of a “faceless panel” thumbing through their private medical notes. Several had been unable to secure the necessary documents because of “pedantic” requirements, for example their specialist had not used an accepted medical term on a form or their old patient paper records had been shredded. Young trans people in particular have described being hurt and angered by the recent intervention from the Equalities and Human Rights Commission urging the Scottish government to pause its reforms for “more detailed consideration”, despite two public consultations since 2017. The argument that the reforms are purely a simplification of the process have been “kicked into touch” by the recent EHRC letter, argues Susan Smith of For Women Scotland, one of the most active critical groups, founded in 2018. “This is opening up gender recognition certificates to a whole new cohort of people, without gate-keeping, and there is huge public opposition to self-identification and the risk of people taking advantage of that.” FWS say supporters are “stepping up” their campaigning – which has already seen protesters booing Nicola Sturgeon outside Holyrood. Recent polling by Savanta ComRes for the BBC found that, while 57% supported making the process of obtaining a certificate easier, support fell over specific proposals, with 40% in favour of self-identification and 38% against it, while 44% opposed reducing the amount of time spent living in the acquired gender, compared with 37% in favour. LGBT+ campaigners say there will be no “floodgates”: the reforms still require a person to be living permanently in their chosen gender for three months, along with a three-month cooling off period, and any increase is likely to reflect those who had other documents, like a passport or driving licence, changed already. They insist that the profile of people applying will not change. But Murray Blackburn Mackenzie, a policy analysis collective also set up in 2018 and which has been highly critical of Scottish government “biased” engagement with sympathetic campaigners, recently argued that ministers sought to “minimise” the effect of the plans, making it “easier to dismiss even the possibility of unintended consequences.”.",News/Society,Scotland’s long-awaited gender recognition reform bill to be published,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/02/scotlands-long-awaited-gender-recognition-reform-bill-to-be-published
3/3/2022,"A groundbreaking academic study examining whether benefit sanctions are linked to claimant ill-health, including mental illness and suicide, has been halted after ministers reneged on a longstanding promise to release sanctions data. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been accused of a “culture of secrecy” when it insisted researchers resubmit approval for the release of the data – after nearly four years of delays since ministers first agreed to share it. The Glasgow University study seeks to examine whether the controversial practice of stopping benefit payments to claimants deemed to be in breach of benefit rules has a negative effect on their health – and creates mounting costs for the NHS. Ministers told MPs in 2019 they were actively supporting the research, though it almost immediately ground to a halt when the DWP insisted on new security protocols for the data release. When these were finally completed last autumn, ministers insisted researchers apply for the data all over again. The chair of the Commons work and pensions select committee, Stephen Timms, accused the DWP of blocking vital research: “This emerging pattern of obstruction suggests that a culture of secrecy is entrenched in DWP. It must wake up to the harm that it is doing and commit to a new spirit of openness.” Sanctions are financial penalties imposed on claimants the DWP says have breached benefit eligibility rules – typically by failing to attend jobcentre meetings, or meet job search targets. Those affected are docked hundreds – and sometimes thousands – of pounds from their benefit payments The Glasgow study proposed to link anonymised DWP data and NHS health records to track changes in the health status of sanctioned individuals, identifying for example if they had been given antidepressant prescriptions, treated for a worsening of underlying conditions such as asthma, or even taken their own life. The study could supply unprecedented detail of the potential impact of benefit sanctions on family breakdown and children’s health and schooling, as well as making visible the wider societal and NHS costs of sanctions, for example through the increased use of health services. Ministers claim benefit sanctions incentivise jobless claimants to move into work. However, critics say the policy is unsupported by robust evidence. There is a growing body of research indicating benefit sanctions are linked to poverty, food bank use, depression and other illness. Despite widespread concerns over the health consequences of sanctions, the DWP has imposed sanctions on a soaring number of people in recent months and the government recently widened the scope of its sanctions regime to include tens of thousands of newly jobless people. Prof Nick Bailey, who is heading the Glasgow sanctions project, said that had the data been shared as originally agreed with the DWP in 2018, his research would have been in the public domain by early 2020. It is now five years since the research process for the project was supposed to have started and it has yet to get under way. “The consequence for both policymakers and benefit claimants is we continue to operate an important policy, sanctions, which has potentially substantial consequences for those affected by it but with very little evidence of the impact of the policy, and almost none on the wider impacts,” said Bailey. A recent Glasgow University paper analysing international studies of sanctions reported “significant associations with increased material hardship and health problems” as well as evidence sanctions “were associated with increased child maltreatment and poorer child wellbeing”. The DWP has repeatedly faced criticisms it is blocking or burying politically uncomfortable research. Last month MPs had to force the publication of a DWP-commissioned report showing people on low incomes reliant on disability benefits struggled to meet basic living costs. Ministers have refused to publish the DWP’s own internal evaluation of sanctions effectiveness, also promised to MPs in 2019, while research originally commissioned back in 2018 assessing the impact of benefit policies on food bank use has also yet to see the light of day. A DWP spokesperson said: “We agreed in principle to release the sanctions data to researchers but this required formal accreditation of the security of the facilities to be used to store the data, as well as legal approval. The UK Statistics Authority granted this accreditation in late 2021 and we are now actively considering the data request.” Benefit sanctions were briefly suspended during the first lockdown in 2020. But numbers have risen in recent months, with the latest data showing there were 50,000 in November – up from 18,000 in July, according to David Webster, a senior research fellow at the University of Glasgow.

3/3/2022,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, with Moscow’s forces having taken the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, at 3am on Wednesday, security chiefs said, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv has also come under more heavy shelling as Russian forces step up their offensive and move forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. Russian armoured vehicles and soldiers could be seen patrolling Kherson. A video released by Ukraine’s ministry of emergency situations shows firefighters attempting to put out a fire burning in the regional headquarters of the ministry of internal affairs in Kharkiv. Video footage shows wrecked residential buildings with no windows, and fallen trees and power lines, in the aftermath of strikes that killed at least 11 people in Kharkiv. Last Thursday Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv. A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. On Friday Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer. On Saturday Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. Over the past few months Russia forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of its two proxy states in east Ukraine. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of around 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and each side has accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, the route of Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/russia-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/3/2022,"World leaders, environment ministers and other representatives from 173 countries have agreed to develop a legally binding treaty on plastics, in what many described a truly historic moment. The resolution, agreed at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi, Kenya, calls for a treaty covering the “full lifecycle” of plastics from production to disposal, to be negotiated over the next two years. It has been described by the head of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) as the most important multilateral environmental deal since the Paris climate accord in 2015. “Against the backdrop of geopolitical turmoil, the UN environment assembly shows multilateral cooperation at its best,” said Espen Barth Eide, the president of UNEA-5 and Norway’s minister for climate and the environment. “Plastic pollution has grown into an epidemic. With today’s resolution we are officially on track for a cure.” Inger Andersen, the director of the UN Environment Programme, tweeted: “We have just gavelled the resolution paving the way for global action to #BeatPlasticPollution. The most important environmental deal since the Paris accord.” “The work starts now!” she added. Andersen described the agreement as a “triumph by planet Earth over single-use plastics” but warned that the mandate did not grant stakeholders a “two-year pause”. “In parallel to negotiations over an international binding agreement, UNEP will work with any willing government and business across the value chain to shift away from single-use plastics, as well as to mobilise private finance and remove barriers to investments in research and in a new circular economy,” Andersen said. UN nations, which have been holding talks in Nairobi this week to discuss the terms for a treaty, agreed it should cover the production and design of plastic, not just waste. The resolution established an intergovernmental negotiating committee, tasked with drafting and ratifying the treaty. It will start work this year and aims to finish by 2024. The resolution introduces provisions to recognise waste pickers, a “groundbreaking development” that would affect millions of people, according to NGOs, and the acknowledgment of the role of Indigenous peoples. It is the first time waste pickers, low-paid workers in developing nations who scavenge for recyclable plastic and other goods, have been recognised in an environmental resolution. NGOs described the resolution as a critical shift in international policymakers’ approach, which previously focused on plastic as a marine litter issue. The mandate recommends measures to tackle plastic production, predicted to almost quadruple by 2050 and take up 10-13% of the global carbon budget. They urged world leaders to show even more resolve in developing and finalising the details of the treaty over the next two years. “We stand at a crossroads in history when ambitious decisions taken today can prevent plastic pollution from contributing to our planet’s ecosystem collapse,” said Marco Lambertini, the director general of WWF International. “But our work is far from over – world leaders must now show even more resolve in developing and implementing a treaty which addresses our current plastic pollution crisis and enables an effective transition to a circular economy for plastic.” Christina Dixon, the deputy ocean campaign lead at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said: “This resolution finally recognises that we cannot begin to address plastics in our ocean and on land without intervening at source – fundamentally, the plastics tap must be turned off if we are serious about tackling the problem.” Dixon said the world was at the “start of a journey” towards securing a legally binding treaty. Approximately 7bn of the estimated 9.2bn tonnes of plastics produced between 1950 and 2017 are now waste. About 75% of that waste is either deposited in landfills or accumulating in terrestrial and aquatic environments and ecosystems. Niven Reddy, the Africa coordinator at the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, said: “This milestone could not have happened without a global movement pushing decision-makers every step of the way.” Joanne Green, a senior policy associate at Tearfund, said: “Today marks the first step towards justice for communities impacted by the burning and dumping of plastic waste. The recognition of waste pickers and the vital role they play in stopping plastic pollution is long overdue; governments must now ensure that they are given a prominent seat at the negotiating table.” The treaty will be accompanied by financial and technical support, including a scientific body to advise it, and the possibility of a dedicated global fund. The resolution was adopted with the conclusion of the three-day UNEA-5.2 meeting, attended by more than 3,400 delegates in person and 1,500 online participants from 175 UN member states, including 79 ministers and 17 high-level officials. There is growing public concern over plastic pollution. More than 60 countries already have implemented bans and levies on plastic packaging and single-use waste, aimed at reducing use and improving waste management. Plastic consumption in developed countries is 2.5 times higher per capita than in developing countries, according to the Planet Tracker thinktank.",News/Environment,World leaders agree to draw up ‘historic’ treaty on plastic waste,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/world-leaders-agree-draw-up-historic-treaty-plastic-waste
3/3/2022,"Winning five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, two Big Cups, two Big Vases, a Super Cup and a Club World Cup is all good and well, but some Chelsea fans of a certain vintage still yearn for how things were before Roman Abramovich pitched his tent in Москва-на-Темзе all those years ago. Life was more innocent back then, what with the electric cattle fence surrounding the pitch, the frequent run-ins with Millwall, betting the farm on a behemoth of a stand in the middle of an economy-jiggering oil crisis and going nine matches without a goal in the old Second Division. Say what you will about Chelsea, but one way or another, they’ve rarely been boring. Good news, then, for those Blues who secretly preferred the fiscal turbulence of the seventies and eighties. Reports suggest Abramovich has his beady eye on the door marked Выполните одно, an aperture he’s more than willing to sling his hook through of his own volition. According to Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, Abramovich has put Chelsea up for sale, and is waiting for Wyss to cobble together a consortium willing to meet the valuation. Negotiations are apparently afoot, with Wyss fully aware that events, dear boy, may force Abramovich’s hand. With the clock ticking apace, it’s a race to the checkouts, rather like the final round of Supermarket Sweep, only without the easy-going charm of Rylan to take the edge off the absurdity. Of course, given Wyss is worth a reported £4.3bn, and anyone else chipping in will also likely have a few quid spare, all of this may ultimately have no effect whatsoever on Chelsea, and the club will continue pootling along as usual, sweeping up every other trophy in its wake. But should Roman take the magic with him when he ups sticks, spiritually sending the club back to the seventies, younger Chelsea fans need not fret, instead looking upon it as an opportunity to experience the very different sort of fun their predecessors enjoyed.

3/3/2022,"In the aftermath of Boris Johnson’s landslide 2019 general election, many assumed that the political balance within the House of Lords had swung squarely behind the Conservatives following a decade of ennoblements by Tory prime ministers. David Cameron and Theresa May had between them elevated 136 Conservatives to the upper chamber over the proceeding nine years. By November 2021, Johnson had ennobled 83 people to become life peers, 42 of whom are Conservatives, while many others were fellow Brexit supporters. And so what has followed has been a surprise. Official figures show that in Johnson’s first parliamentary session from December 2019 to March 2021, the Lords defeated the government on 114 occasions. This is the highest number of defeats in a single parliamentary session since Harold Wilson’s government in 1975-1976 was defeated 126 times. On Monday, the policies at the heart of the Johnson government’s nationality and borders bill were defeated in the Lords on five occasions. The vote removed a key plank of the bill, known as clause 11, which would have stripped refugees arriving here via irregular routes of full rights such as a right to a family reunion and access to a public safety net. Peers voted by 204 to 126, defeating the clause by a majority of 78. This was followed on Tuesday by the loss of two votes in a health bill. And on Wednesday, the government is expected to lose more in a further examination of the borders bill. Perhaps the most spectacular recent losses in the Lords came in January, when the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill suffered 14 defeats. Most of these were reversible in the Commons because they represent changes to the bill, but Priti Patel, the home secretary, tried to add 18 pages to the bill, including a series of new public order offences aimed at preventing a recurrence of last year’s Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion protests. The Conservatives are by far the biggest grouping in the upper chamber. They have 258 peers and might expect to be able to count on the support of many of the 39 non-affiliated peers such as Ian Botham, Kate Hoey and Claire Fox, who were sponsored by Johnson. Labour Lords in comparison have 168 members, while the Lib Dems have 83. But to win votes, the government has to also win over some of the 183 cross-bench peers – who operate as a grouping but without a whipping operation – and 25 bishops. According to Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the Lords, the size, complexity and controversial nature of the bills now coming before parliament means that they can easily be challenged. “We are getting these mega bills that are so badly drafted that peers can see glaring problems. Many Conservative peers do see themselves as guardians of the constitution. They believe that you should look at the detail and they want to see good legislation coming out of the Downing Street machine,” she said. Another problem for Johnson, she said, is that a large number of Conservative peers are not happy with the prime minister in the aftermath of partygate allegations and no longer identify with the party’s leadership or culture. “These are very strange times politically. A Brexiter Tory member told me the other day: ‘This isn’t the Conservative party that I joined, I am very uncomfortable with the changes.’ There is a general unhappiness and malaise on their backbenches,” Smith said. One cross-bench peer, who is no fan of Johnson, pointed out that many of his appointments are not showing up to vote. He gave the example of Lord Lebedev, the Russian son of a KGB officer and owner of the Evening Standard and the Independent. He was elevated to the Lords in July 2020 but has not voted yet or made a single contribution in the chamber. There is also concern on the red benches at a tendency by ministers to make laws that are constructed to avoid line-by-line scrutiny. Two Lords reports issued in November, one entitled Government by Diktat, and the other, Democracy Denied, warned that bills often provided only a broad outline of the law, with the details to be filled in later through secondary legislation, which cannot be amended and can become law without parliamentary debate. Dr Hannah White, the deputy director of the Institute for Government, said that the growing number of government defeats appeared to reflect concerns about the government’s laws. “This could indicate concerns in the House of Lords about the quality of the legislation and the powers that ministers are giving themselves in primary legislation,” she said. The Conservative party has been approached for comment.",News/Politics,String of Lords defeats reflects concerns over PM and legislation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/02/string-of-lords-defeats-reflects-concerns-over-pm-and-legislation
3/3/2022,"While on air, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D’Agata stated last week that Ukraine “isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European – I have to choose those words carefully, too – city, one where you wouldn’t expect that, or hope that it’s going to happen”. If this is D’Agata choosing his words carefully, I shudder to think about his impromptu utterances. After all, by describing Ukraine as “civilized”, isn’t he really telling us that Ukrainians, unlike Afghans and Iraqis, are more deserving of our sympathy than Iraqis or Afghans? Righteous outrage immediately mounted online, as it should have in this case, and the veteran correspondent quickly apologized, but since Russia began its large-scale invasion on 24 February, D’Agata has hardly been the only journalist to see the plight of Ukrainians in decidedly chauvinistic terms. The BBC interviewed a former deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine, who told the network: “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blond hair … being killed every day.” Rather than question or challenge the comment, the BBC host flatly replied, “I understand and respect the emotion.” On France’s BFM TV, journalist Phillipe Corbé stated this about Ukraine: “We’re not talking here about Syrians fleeing the bombing of the Syrian regime backed by Putin. We’re talking about Europeans leaving in cars that look like ours to save their lives.” In other words, not only do Ukrainians look like “us”; even their cars look like “our” cars. And that trite observation is seriously being trotted out as a reason for why we should care about Ukrainians. There’s more, unfortunately. An ITV journalist reporting from Poland said: “Now the unthinkable has happened to them. And this is not a developing, third world nation. This is Europe!” As if war is always and forever an ordinary routine limited to developing, third world nations. (By the way, there’s also been a hot war in Ukraine since 2014. Also, the first world war and second world war.) Referring to refugee seekers, an Al Jazeera anchor chimed in with this: “Looking at them, the way they are dressed, these are prosperous … I’m loath to use the expression … middle-class people. These are not obviously refugees looking to get away from areas in the Middle East that are still in a big state of war. These are not people trying to get away from areas in North Africa. They look like any.” Apparently looking “middle class” equals “the European family living next door”. And writing in the Telegraph, Daniel Hannan explained: “They seem so like us. That is what makes it so shocking. Ukraine is a European country. Its people watch Netflix and have Instagram accounts, vote in free elections and read uncensored newspapers. War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations.” What all these petty, superficial differences – from owning cars and clothes to having Netflix and Instagram accounts – add up to is not real human solidarity for an oppressed people. In fact, it’s the opposite. It’s tribalism. These comments point to a pernicious racism that permeates today’s war coverage and seeps into its fabric like a stain that won’t go away. The implication is clear: war is a natural state for people of color, while white people naturally gravitate toward peace. It’s not just me who found these clips disturbing. The US-based Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association was also deeply troubled by the coverage, recently issuing a statement on the matter: “Ameja condemns and categorically rejects orientalist and racist implications that any population or country is ‘uncivilized’ or bears economic factors that make it worthy of conflict,” reads the statement. “This type of commentary reflects the pervasive mentality in western journalism of normalizing tragedy in parts of the world such as the Middle East, Africa, south Asia, and Latin America.” Such coverage, the report correctly noted, “dehumanizes and renders their experience with war as somehow normal and expected”. More troubling still is that this kind of slanted and racist media coverage extends beyond our screens and newspapers and easily bleeds and blends into our politics. Consider how Ukraine’s neighbors are now opening their doors to refugee flows, after demonizing and abusing refugees, especially Muslim and African refugees, for years. “Anyone fleeing from bombs, from Russian rifles, can count on the support of the Polish state,” the Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, recently stated. Meanwhile, multiple reports indicate that Polish border guards are actively and forcibly turning away African students who were studying in Ukraine, thereby preventing them from crossing into safety. In Austria, Chancellor Karl Nehammer stated that “of course we will take in refugees, if necessary”. Meanwhile, just last fall and in his then-role as interior minister, Nehammer was known as a hardliner against resettling Afghan refugees in Austria and as a politician who insisted on Austria’s right to forcibly deport rejected Afghan asylum seekers, even if that meant returning them to the Taliban. “It’s different in Ukraine than in countries like Afghanistan,” he told Austrian TV. “We’re talking about neighborhood help.” Yes, that makes sense, you might say. Neighbor helping neighbor. But what these journalists and politicians all seem to want to miss is that the very concept of providing refuge is not and should not be based on factors such as physical proximity or skin color, and for a very good reason. If our sympathy is activated only for welcoming people who look like us or pray like us, then we are doomed to replicate the very sort of narrow, ignorant nationalism that war promotes in the first place. The idea of granting asylum, of providing someone with a life free from political persecution, must never be founded on anything but helping innocent people who need protection. That’s where the core principle of asylum is located. Today, Ukrainians are living under a credible threat of violence and death coming directly from Russia’s criminal invasion, and we absolutely should be providing Ukrainians with life-saving security wherever and whenever we can. (Though let’s also recognize that it’s always easier to provide asylum to people who are victims of another’s aggression rather than of our own policies.) But if we decide to help Ukrainians in their desperate time of need because they happen to look like “us” or dress like “us” or pray like “us,” or if we reserve our help exclusively for them while denying the same help to others, then we have not only chosen the wrong reasons to support another human being. We have also, and I’m choosing these words carefully, shown ourselves as giving up on civilization and opting for barbarism instead.

3/3/2022,"Two people come to mind when I recall my teenage anxieties about being blown to kingdom come in a nuclear war. One is an ancient American farmer; the other is my chemistry teacher, Mr Fenwick. I was in the upper sixth and we were both in the school production of Cabaret. I was hopeless as the leading man; Mr Fenwick was brilliant as the MC, a role for which he wore tights. Honestly, the 80s – what were we like? I digress. After rehearsals I’d give him a lift to Stourbridge Junction train station, and we’d have a pint in the pub across the road. One time we somehow got on to his childhood memories of the Cuban missile crisis. “I remember thinking, ‘Fucking hell, we’re all going to die,’” he said with feeling. This was the first and only time in my school years I heard a teacher use the F-word. He conveyed brilliantly the visceral fear he’d felt more than 20 years earlier; for a fleeting moment he was back there and he’d taken me with him. For all the horror I felt at that close shave humanity had had, even then it seemed like something rather quaint, a calamity my parents’ generation had narrowly dodged. Good sense had prevailed, and would surely do so again if we ever again found ourselves so close to the abyss. This was February 1985. I was already on the third Soviet leader of my teenage years: Brezhnev had died just over two years earlier, to be followed, briefly, by Andropov, who was succeeded, even more briefly, by Chernenko. All three of them, in their severe, grey way, had chilled me to the bone. My main preoccupations doubtless concerned all the standard adolescent agonies, but beneath it all the threat of Armageddon was always in the background, humming and clicking away like a Geiger counter. Even as Mr Fenwick and I chatted over our pints of Banks’s bitter, I was dimly aware that there was probably a Soviet missile aimed at us. Perhaps it had “Stourbridge” or “the Black Country” scrawled on it in Cyrillic script. And yet I don’t think I ever truly believed it would happen. I must have been a subscriber to the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, because I somehow found reassurance in the very madness of it all. I recall an item on television news about a large-scale rehearsal for a nuclear attack somewhere, I think in the American midwest. I’m hazy on the details but I remember very clearly a vox pop with an old boy, a resident of a town in the area. He looked like someone out of a Steinbeck novel, and spoke in the kind of accent someone might speak in if they were mocking a country boy drawl. Asked if the simulation exercise had caused him to worry any more about the prospect of a nuclear winter, he chewed thoughtfully on whatever he was chewing, and then said something like: “The way I see it, there isn’t one critter in this whole darned world crazy enough to start something like this.” Yes, I thought: I think that’s right. I hoped that was right. I still hope he was right. My daughters, only one of whom is a still a teenager, have both confessed to some alarm over Ukraine, and where this is all going to end. I’ve said two things to them, neither particularly helpful. The first has been along the lines of: “Ha, you should have tried being a teenager when I was a teenager. We had this the whole time. Imagine that.” Then, catching myself on, I’ve tried to reassure them with a cobble-together of various bits of geopolitical wisdom I’ve picked up from some of the wise owls I’ve spoken to on the radio. Naturally, I’ve edited out the alarming stuff I’ve heard from those wise owls I know and trust – such as the former US presidential adviser on Russia Fiona Hill, and the journalist Misha Glenny – who aren’t entirely sure that Putin won’t press one of his nuclear buttons. I suppose one advantage, if you can call it that, our teenagers have is that they already have experience of dealing with not one but two existential threats to humanity. That’s certainly what the pandemic felt like in its darkest days, and the climate emergency is deepening all the time. I didn’t have any such concerns. All I had to worry about was nuclear war; I didn’t know I was born. As my chemistry teacher and I drained our pints in the Labour in Vain pub next to the train station, Chernenko wasn’t long for this world. The following month he was replaced by Gorbachev, who looked less grey and forbidding than any of his predecessors. He certainly didn’t look like the kind of guy who would press the button. One thing led to another and, before the 80s were out, the Berlin wall had come down, the iron curtain had lifted and the danger seemed to have passed for ever. Bar perhaps the chubby North Korean with the flappy trousers, no contender for the title of nuclear-armed crazy critter for the ages presented himself. I assumed we were out of the woods; I never thought I’d be as scared as Mr Fenwick had been over Cuba. How wrong I was. I wonder if he’s as scared now as he was back then. If he wants to meet up in the Labour in Vain to share his feelings, I’ll buy the first round.
