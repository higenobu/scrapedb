4/8/2022,"Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, acknowledged in an interview published on Thursday that Russia had sustained “significant losses of troops” and called it a “huge tragedy.” The remarks, which were made to Sky News, are a rare acknowledgement from Moscow of the difficulties Russia has confronted in its invasion of Ukraine. Russia has not provided many updates regarding its troops’ casualties; previous figures reported by Moscow have been notably lower than estimates from Ukraine and NATO. The interview comes as Russian troops have left the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv and Kyiv, unable to quickly seize the capital of Ukraine as initially hoped. Peskov claimed that Russia was acting in “goodwill” by withdrawing from both areas, telling Sky News, “It was a goodwill act to lift tension from those regions and show Russia is really ready to create comfortable conditions to continue negotiations.” U.S. officials have expressed skepticism about Moscow pulling back its troops in those areas, however, with Pentagon press secretary John Kirby saying last week, “We believe this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal.” Peskov also denied the accusations of Russian atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, where photos and videos shared by Ukrainian officials have shown bodies strewn in the streets with their hands tied behind their backs. He told Sky News the situation in the Ukrainian city is a “​​well-staged insinuation, nothing else.” “We deny the Russian military can have something in common with these atrocities and that dead bodies were shown on the streets of Bucha,” Peskov said. Peskov also claimed Russia had “very serious reasons to believe” that the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol was “fake.” The Kremlin spokesperson continued to refer to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an “operation” rather than a war. The assault on Ukraine has led over four million people to flee the country, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency, and has killed or injured thousands of civilians.

Researchers with San Diego State University (SDSU) in California have shared a spectacular video of western banded geckos fighting scorpions. These geckos are normally thought of as fairly mild-mannered creatures. But, as you can see in the video shared by the SDSU, they can put out quite a thrashing when they need to.

These geckos prey on small arthropods like crickets and beetles. However, scorpions are also part of their menu, it seems. And, when they feed on these dangerous creatures, the geckos get pretty feisty. Instead of pouncing and attacking the scorpions like they would other creatures, the geckos actually writhe around violently after grabbing the scorpion. It’s an interesting sight to behold, and one that we’re not sure to forget anytime soon. You can see the video for yourself above. It is very reminiscent of how some predators capture their prey and then violently shake them to incapacitate them. The researchers believe that the western banded geckos fight the scorpions this way to render them unable to fight back. They shared their research on the way western banded geckos fight scorpions in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society. SDSU biologists Rulon Clark and Malachi Whitford, graduate students from the SDSU and the University of California joint Davis Ph.D. program, conducted the study. Clark says he first noticed the western banded gecko’s unique behavior when studying flat-tailed horned lizards in the 1990s. (via Newsweek) After a few years, he returned to commence another study. During that time, though, he and Whitford managed to film western banded geckos fighting scorpions and other prey. They were then able to dig deeper into the gecko’s natural behavior by studying the video. Most of us can probably look at geckos without being intimidated. After all, they aren’t scary creatures. Some companies, like Geico, have even gone on to use them as brand images. But, after seeing the way that these western banded geckos go toe-to-toe with scorpions, there definitely seems to be more to these little creatures than first meets the eye. If nothing else, this is just another reminder of how intriguing nature and the wild creatures that we share this planet with can be. Click here to read the full article.

4/8/2022,"By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday suspended Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council over reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" in Ukraine, prompting Moscow to announce it was quitting the body. The U.S.-led push garnered 93 votes in favor, while 24 countries voted no and 58 countries abstained. A two-thirds majority of voting members in the 193-member General Assembly in New York - abstentions do not count - was needed to suspend Russia from the 47-member Geneva-based Human Rights Council. Speaking after the vote, Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Gennady Kuzmin described the move as an ""illegitimate and politically motivated step"" and then announced that Russia had decided to quit the Human Rights Council altogether. ""You do not submit your resignation after you are fired,"" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters. Russia was in its second year of a three-year term. Under Thursday's resolution, the General Assembly could have later agreed to end the suspension. But that cannot happen now Russia has quit the council, just as the United States did in 2018 over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform. The United States was last year re-elected to the council. Suspensions are rare. Libya was suspended in 2011 because of violence against protesters by forces loyal to then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United Nations ""sent a clear message that the suffering of victims and survivors will not be ignored."" ""We ensured a persistent and egregious human rights violator will not be allowed to occupy a position of leadership on human rights at the U.N.,"" she said in remarks to be delivered to the General Assembly later on Thursday. The Human Rights Council cannot make legally binding decisions. Its decisions send important political messages, however, and it can authorize investigations. Last month the council opened an investigation into allegations of rights violations, including possible war crimes, in Ukraine. The resolution on Thursday was the third adopted by the 193-member General Assembly since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. The two previous General Assembly resolutions denouncing Russia were adopted with 141 and 140 votes in favor. After abstaining on the previous two General Assembly votes, Russia's partner China opposed the resolution on Thursday. ""Such a hasty move at the General Assembly, which forces countries to choose sides, will aggravate the division among member states and intensify the confrontation between the parties concerned - it is like adding fuel to the fire,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said before the vote. The General Assembly text on Thursday expresses ""grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine,"" particularly at reports of rights abuses by Russia. Russia says it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" that aims to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure and denies attacking civilians. Ukraine and allies say Moscow invaded without provocation. Russia had warned countries that a yes vote or abstention will be viewed as an ""unfriendly gesture"" with consequences for bilateral ties, according to a note seen by Reuters.
