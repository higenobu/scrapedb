5/3/2022,"Here’s a hard lesson that many new investors have learned in 2022: Stocks don’t always go up. Year to date, the S&P 500 has tumbled 14%. But you don’t necessarily need a rallying market to make money in stocks. You can always earn passive income through dividends. And owning real estate investment trusts is one of the best ways to do that. REITs collect rent from their properties and pass it along to shareholders. That means investors don’t have to worry about screening tenants, fixing damages or chasing down late payments. They simply sit back and watch the dividend checks roll in. The sector has caught Wall Street’s attention too. Here are three REITs that institutional investors find particularly attractive — even in today’s shaky market environment. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Boston Properties is the largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of Class A office properties — high-quality buildings that command high rents — in the U.S. The company has a portfolio of 201 properties totaling 52.8 million square feet. Boston Properties generates long-term recurring rental revenue as its portfolio has a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.8 years. Management maintains a strong focus on gateway regions with long-term rent growth prospects. Its top three markets by net operating income are Boston (34%), New York (28%) and San Francisco (20%). Paying quarterly dividends of 98 cents per share, the REIT currently offers an annual yield of 3.3%. Last week, Mizuho analyst Vikram Malhotra upgraded Boston Properties from ‘neutral’ to ‘buy,’ naming the stock his top pick in the office REIT space. His price target of $135 is roughly 10% above current levels. Warehouses may not seem like exciting pieces of property, but investors of Prologis aren’t complaining. The warehouse-focused REIT has delivered a total return — stock price appreciation plus dividends earned — of more than 200% over the past five years. Logistics facilities like warehouses are critical to our economy, particularly as consumers have embraced online shopping. Prologis is a leading player in the field. It has investments in 4,675 logistics facilities that total nearly 1 billion square feet. They are leased to 5,800 customers across two major categories: business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment. The REIT’s top tenants include names like Amazon, FedEx, DHL and UPS — companies that are firmly entrenched during this era of e-commerce. Prologis pays quarterly dividends of 79 cents per share, giving it an annual yield of 1.9%. On Monday, Raymond James analyst William Crow reiterated a ‘strong buy’ rating on Prologis, noting the sector’s potential to deliver free cash flow and increasing dividends. He also raised his price target on the shares to $190 — around 14% above where the stock sits today. Public Storage is a leading player in the self-storage business. It owns more than 2,800 self-storage facilities in 39 states totaling 200 million rentable square feet. The company has been around for 50 years, and it’s still growing. From 2010 to 2021, the REIT’s same-store net operating income increased by 80%. The business has served income investors well, providing dividends every single quarter since 1981. Today, the REIT has a quarterly dividend rate of $2.00 per share, translating to an annual yield of just over 2%. The stock has also picked up momentum, gaining about 45% over the past 12 months. More returns could be on the horizon. JPMorgan analyst Michael Mueller recently raised his price target on Public Storage from $385 to $434 while maintaining an ‘overweight’ rating. With the stock trading just below $400 right now, Mueller’s target implies potential upside of almost 10%.

5/3/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- In times of Treasury turmoil, the biggest investor outside American soil has historically lent a helping hand. Not this time round. Most Read from Bloomberg Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Selling Billions End of Easy Money Brings a $410 Billion Global Financial Shock Citi Says Trader Made Error Behind Flash Crash in Europe Stocks Dip Buyers Save the Day as Stocks Finish Higher: Markets Wrap Ukraine Latest: Johnson to Evoke ‘Finest Hour’ in Speech to Kyiv Japanese institutional managers -- known for their legendary U.S. debt buying sprees in recent decades -- are now fueling the great bond selloff just as the Federal Reserve pares its $9 trillion balance sheet. Estimates from BMO Capital Markets based on the most recent data show the largest overseas holder of Treasuries has offloaded almost $60 billion over the past three months. While that may be small change relative to the Japan’s $1.3 trillion stockpile, the divestment threatens to grow. That’s because the monetary path between the U.S. and the Asian nation is diverging ever more, the yen is plumbing 20-year lows and market volatility stateside is breaking out. All that is ramping up currency-hedging costs and completely offsetting the appeal of higher nominal U.S. yields, especially among large life insurers. Read more: New Waves of Treasury Selling to Push Yields Over 3%: MLIV Pulse The upshot: Japanese accounts are contributing to the historic Treasury rout and may not return en masse until the benchmark 10-year yield trades firmly above 3%. In fact, near-zero-yielding bonds at home look ever-more appealing even as U.S. debt offers some of the highest rates in years. “It’s a significant amount of selling and on par with what we saw in early 2017 from Japan,” said Ben Jeffery, BMO’s rates strategist. While an aggressive Fed tightening cycle to combat inflation could result in multiple 50 basis-point hikes in the coming months, the Bank of Japan remains locked in endless stimulus. That’s weakening the yen and upending the economics of buying Treasuries even as the 10-year Japanese government bond remains capped around 0.25%. While 10-year U.S. yields traded a whisker away from 3% in New York trading, buyers who pay to protect against fluctuations in the yen-dollar exchange rate see their effective yields dwindle to just 1.3%. That’s because hedging costs have ballooned to 1.66 percentage points, a level not seen since early 2020 when the global demand for dollars spiked in the pandemic rout. A year ago the Treasury benchmark was offering a similar yield, when accounting for the cost of protecting against moves in the exchange rate thanks to a modest 32 basis-point hedging expense. “Hedge costs are the issue for investing in U.S. Treasuries,” said Eiichiro Miura, general manager of the fixed-income department at Nissay Asset Management Corp. Fed tightening cycles and the associated market volatility have tempered Japanese buying of Treasuries in the past. But in this cycle, the high level of uncertainty surrounding U.S. inflation and interest-rate policy may trigger an extended absence. At the same time, Japanese traders returning from the Golden Week holiday have other offshore options as euro-hedging costs remain near the one-year average. “In the span of next six months or so, investing in Europe is better than the U.S. as hedge costs are likely to be low,” said Tatsuya Higuchi, executive chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co. “Among the euro bonds, Spain, Italy or France look appealing given the spreads.” Typically, Japanese buying has favored intermediate sectors of the Treasury curve from five- to 10-year notes, while life insurers and pension funds have focused on 30-year bonds. But hopes that the Treasury market would see long-end buying in the new financial year that began in April have been dashed as some big life insurers rethink their exposure to overseas debt, given currency volatility spurred in large part by the hawkish monetary shift at the U.S. central bank. “The Fed is being super aggressive,” said John Madziyire, portfolio manager at Vanguard Group Inc. “Are you really going to buy when Treasuries will probably get to more attractive levels?” One broad Treasury index is already sitting on a more than 8% loss so far this year. Much now rests on whether the 10-year can consolidate in a range of 2.80% to 3.10% this month once the upcoming Fed meeting is absorbed by the market along with quarterly debt sales from the U.S. Treasury. It briefly exceeded 3% Monday for the first time since 2018. “Japanese investors will wait for some stabilization in long-dated yields before they sense a buying opportunity,” said George Goncalves, head of macro strategy at MUFG. “If the 10-year settles during May, that will help attract buyers and at those yield levels you are getting compensated now.” (Adds Monday’s yield level in second-to-last paragraph.

5/3/2022,"Robinhood (HOOD) stock has been on a downtrend since its IPO in July of last year. The financial services company, which aims to “democratize finance for all,” also recently produced a lackluster earnings report for Q1 2022. Amid Robinhood’s financial woes, finance YouTube channel host and retail trader Matt Kohrs believes the outlook is bleak for the company’s stock. “At least from the retail trading community, which I'm happily a member of, I don't really think the sentiment has changed, I mean, it's a dumpster fire of a situation,” Kohrs told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I mean, in 2021, they managed to throw $3.7 billion into a pit, douse it in gasoline, and light it on fire. And it seems like they're not really changing course, as we're kicking off 2022.” Kohrs joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss quarterly earnings for Robinhood and why retail traders are leaving the platform. The company posted a larger-than-expected loss for the quarter ended March 31, as total net revenues decreased 43% year over year to $299 million. The first quarter of 2022 marked the fifth consecutive quarterly drop in revenue for Robinhood, with the total net loss coming in at $392 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. Monthly active users also fell 10% year over year — a major hit to Robinhood’s payment for order flow (PFOF) business model, of which the online brokerage has received criticism in the past for. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, an outspoken critic of the PFOF model, likened Robinhood’s financial reckoning to “God enacting justice.” “I think there's definitely a jump now,” Kohrs said. “People are ditching Robinhood for other commission-free brokerages. But I think there's two major ways to look at this. If we look at classic fundamental analysis of what's happening, their monthly active users in the quarter over quarter dropping by about 1.4 million, and on top of that, it's worse because they're also getting less money per user — the revenue's dropping.” Kohrs noted that Robinhood’s perception by the retail trading community is central to its usership and, consequently, how its stock performs. And right now, he said, retail traders view the platform to be “a little bit closer to the Sheriff of Nottingham” — the unjust tyrant in the tale of Robin Hood — rather than the titular hero himself. “There's definitely been an exodus from Robinhood,” he said. “One of the ones that I know is becoming very popular is Public. It's another commission-free brokerage. But the difference is there's no payment for order flow. As there's retail traders learning more and more about what's going on in terms of market structure … they're happy paying a commission, understanding that [they’re] paying for transparency, or they're going to ones that just don't engage in payment for order flow at all.” Even in terms of its cryptocurrency exchange offerings, Robinhood may be falling behind the competition. The company reported in its latest earnings report that its cryptocurrency transaction revenues decreased 39% year over year to $54 million, compared to $88 million in the first quarter of 2021. And although Robinhood Crypto added the ability to buy and sell popular cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), Compound (COMP1-USD), and Polygon (MATIC-USD) in mid-April, Kohrs believes it may be too little, too late. “So even if they're attempting to rebrand and really focus on crypto, it seems like it's going a little bit too slow in that their burn rate right now, like I said, [was] $3.7 billion last year,” he said. “They already burned another $300-plus billion this first quarter. And really, the sentiment of it, I just don't see many people. In terms of equities, options, and crypto, I think there's different brokerages and exchanges that are more trusted than Robinhood.” Thomas Hum is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

5/3/2022,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) reports Q1 2022 results after Tuesday’s closing bell, with analysts forecasting a profit of $0.92 per-share on $5.58 billion in revenue. If met, earnings-per-share (EPS) will mark a 75% increase on profit compared to the same quarter last year. The stock rose more than 5% in February after beating Q4 2021 top and bottom line estimates but rolled over quickly and has lost more than 30% of its value in the last three months. AMD’s innovative pipeline features the new Genoa server chip, which should compete forcefully with Dow component Intel Corp. (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). However, PHLX Semiconductor Index has lost more than 26% this year, highlighting a painful deterioration in sentiment. Worse yet, chip stocks are showing no signs of bottoming out, with Intel nearing a breakdown and industry leader NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) trading at a 9-month low. But not everyone is bearish on AMD’s outlook. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso upgraded the stock to ‘Strong Buy’ last week, insisted the company is well-positioned to thrive in a tough semi environment. As he notes “we have become more concerned about cycle risks given potential for slowing consumer demand and elevated inventory levels at customers, (but) we favor those semi companies with strong secular drivers, more muted cyclical exposure and attractive valuations, for which AMD appears well positioned.” Wall Street consensus stands at an ‘Overweight’ rating based upon 20 ‘Buy’, 4 ‘Overweight’, 14 ‘Hold’, and 1 ‘Sell’ recommendation. Price targets currently range from a low of $100 to a Street-high $185 while the stock is set to open Monday’s session nearly $15 below the low target. This dismal placement highlights the failure of analysts to properly evaluate the financial and psychological impact of rising inflation, war in Eastern Europe, and chronic supply chain disruptions. Advanced Micro broke out above 20-year resistance at 48.50 at the start of 2020, entering a powerful uptrend that stair-stepped to an all-time high at 164.46 in November 2021. The stock has been cut in half since that time, giving up nearly two-thirds of the gains posted since the March 2020 low. It broke through support at 100 in April and is now targeting the May 2021 low in the low 70s.  An active monthly sell cycle should keep pressure on price in the second quarter, favoring downside into that support zone.
