1/3/2022,"People struggling to get lateral flow tests for Covid “should just refresh” their webpage, the education secretary has suggested, as concerns mount over the impact of the Omicron variant on the country’s workforce. Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News he had organised a separate supply of tests for schools in England ahead of children’s return to the classrooms, amid requests they take at least two a week.  But when it was put to the cabinet minister that shortages of tests were still being reported intermittently across the country, he said: “If people feel that they can’t get a supply they should just refresh their webpage.” Zahawi said supply had been increased to 300m a month and delivery capacity trebled to 900,000 a day. In addition to testing, the government will ask secondary students in England to wear masks in classrooms once again. And it was announced that an additional 7,000 air cleaning units will be provided to schools, colleges and early years settings to improve ventilation in teaching spaces. Classes could be merged if the number of school staff off sick grew too high, the education secretary has said. He told Sky News: “The priority is to keep schools open. The testing, the staffing support we’re putting in place, and of course the ventilation is going to make a big difference to schools this year. The most important thing is to keep them open. “We monitor staff absenteeism, I just said to you we’re running at about 8% last year. If that rises further then we look at things like merging classes, teaching in bigger numbers.” But Zahawi repeated the government line that “there’s nothing in the data” to suggest further coronavirus measures will be needed later this week. He told BBC Breakfast that plan B measures would be reviewed on Wednesday, but added: “There’s nothing in the data that gives me any concern that we need to go beyond where we are at. “There’s some really good data from London that it looks like the infection rates are plateauing, if not yet coming down. But we are seeing leakage into the over-50s in terms of infections, and it’s generally the over-50s who end up with severe infection and hospitalisation.” Zahawi moved to reassure patients that the NHS is “very good at being able to move staff around”, amid fears over shortages in the health service. He said the NHS was used to dealing with staff being off over the winter and during “big flu viruses”. He told BBC Breakfast: “The NHS is very good at being able to move staff around within the system. They have an infrastructure to do that. We now have 10,000 more nurses and 3,000 more doctors than we had last year working in the NHS. “But the NHS is very good at sort of making sure that staff shortages are monitored and dealt with pretty well. They’ve done it over many years in winter when we’ve been, you know, have big flu viruses around.”",News/World news,"Just refresh webpage, UK minister tells people trying to get Covid tests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/just-refresh-webpage-uk-minister-tells-people-trying-covid-tests
1/3/2022,"On the first Sunday of 2021, a first-half Chelsea capitulation against Manchester City hastened Frank Lampard’s exit and deepened a despondent mood. Twelve months on, Liverpool’s two early goals at Stamford Bridge could have induced Groundhog Day feelings. Instead, Thomas Tuchel’s side roared back and showed that, whatever other problems have recently beset the Chelsea manager on and off the field, this is a team that plays for him. Though they did so in a rather un-Tuchel-like manner. The intense atmosphere generated by the Premier League debut of safe standing was met with the kind of front-foot, high-tempo performance more associated with a Jürgen Klopp side. Chelsea were the better team against Liverpool but they will rue the openness at the back that meant they had to settle for another draw which probably ends their title hopes, and more than the much-discussed Romelu Lukaku it is their first-choice full-backs, Ben Chilwell and Reece James, that they are missing most. Tom Davies  Tuchel refuses to guarantee Lukaku return to Chelsea team Liverpool were not at their fluent, cohesive best at Chelsea, though they played their part in a compelling spectacle. But they came away with a point because they have what Chelsea lack, forwards with a ruthless and instinctive eye for goal. It was no surprise Mohamed Salah scored another fabulous goal, and could have added an even better one with an instinctive long-range chip that Édouard Mendy saved sharply, but Sadio Mané’s was the more intriguing display after a lean run. His goal showcased the Senegalese at his clinical best, punishing Trevor Chalobah’s botched clearance, and he was a busy presence throughout. Yet there were also rash moments, from the risky raising of an elbow against César Azpilicueta in the sixth second of the match to the slightly weak, hasty finishes at the end of a couple of slick breakaways early in the second half. Overall he showed enough to demonstrate why Senegal will cherish him, and Liverpool miss him, during the Africa Cup of Nations. TD Match report: Chelsea 2-2 Liverpool There are times when you can take genuine succour from listening to your opponents. “Arsenal were better,” Pep Guardiola said after Manchester City’s smash and grab at the Emirates. “We faced an incredible team,” agreed Rodri, the matchwinner. Guardiola has historically gone out of his way to praise Mikel Arteta, a close friend, but no exaggeration was required on Saturday: City were overwhelmed for half of the game and Arsenal would do well to focus on that rather than the VAR calls, correct but convoluted, that helped turn the outcome. Officials are not biased against your team, whoever you support, even if is tempting to feel that way after such a rousing display counts for nothing. It is better to focus on what gives pleasure. Nick Ames Match report: Arsenal 1-2 Manchester City Another example of how VAR creates controversy. When Hugo Lloris dived at the feet of João Pedro and the referee, Robert Jones, who seemed in a good position, decisively gestured that the goalkeeper had won the ball, there was no reason not to think the decision had been correct. The ball had squirted out of the challenge at the sort of angle that suggested Lloris had taken it cleanly. But slowed down, a different picture emerged. Lloris, almost certainly, did foul Pedro, but that was almost impossible to tell in real time. Before VAR, while Watford fans may still have been outraged, others would have shrugged and accepted that in a fast-moving game, some things are impossible to give. Now, though, VAR creates an expectation of perfection and that makes the already difficult job of refereeing even harder. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Watford 0-1 Tottenham Patrick Vieira’s decision to replace Luka Milivojevic and Christian Benteke with Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta in the second half almost rescued a point for Palace, three goals down at the break to West Ham. Olise has now been directly involved in a goal every 63 minutes in the Premier League this season having set up Odsonne Édouard before scoring directly from a free-kick. Not bad for a player who hadn’t even trained for the last week and a half. “Michael is a top young player with a lot of talent,” said Vieira. “It was a gamble for us, as we didn’t know how he was physically. I was really pleased with the way he came into the game because he created chances, he created situations, and he scored a goal. He showed in the space of 20 minutes his quality, and that’s really good for the football club.” Ed Aarons Match report: Crystal Palace 2-3 West Ham Brentford can be delighted with the first half of their Premier League bow. After 19 games they are 12th with 23 points and, even though there is plenty of football to be played, you would struggle to find a single onlooker who believes they will not secure another season in the top flight. That said, the victory over Aston Villa felt crucial given they had only won two games in their previous 11. It was earned through sheer grit and Thomas Frank had a fair point when he said afterwards that only Leeds have suffered comparable injury woes. Promoted sides often wilt when the ravages of the winter begin to kick in but Brentford, who dazzled with their flowing football in the Championship but have shown different sides to their game in the Premier League, have displayed the mentality of giants to pull through and prove doubters wrong. Nick Ames Match report: Brentford 2-1 Aston Villa Whereas Rafael Benítez prefers to freeze out Lucas Digne to such an extent that Séamus Coleman started at left wing-back against Brighton, with the France international an unused substitute for Everton’s eighth defeat in 11 games, Graham Potter’s ability to keep unhappy players onside underpinned his club’s first ever victory at Goodison Park. Alexis Mac Allister was, by his manager’s own admission, frustrated with his limited playing time earlier in the season but marked his third successive start in a demanding week with a match-winning display against Benítez’s toiling team. “It just goes to show that football changes quickly,” the Brighton manager said. “Alexis has worked hard, stuck with the team and because he has been professional he can come in and perform. He scored two great goals but his overall performance was fantastic.” Andy Hunter Match report: Everton 2-3 Brighton It is far-fetched to ever suggest one team’s fortunes are defined by a single player, but the case of Maxwel Cornet and Burnley is about as close as you could find right now. Cornet’s sixth goal of the season in 11 Premier League appearances looked as though it would rescue a point at Leeds before the visitors were undone by two late strikes. The worry for Burnley is that Cornet, a player who they clearly rely on for moments of magic, is now headed for the Africa Cup of Nations. That makes Burnley’s January business all the more important but, even with new additions, you suspect their hopes of survival will revolve largely around one man as the season heads for the final stretch. Aaron Bower Match report: Leeds 3-1 Burnley Manchester United are unbeaten in five games under Ralf Rangnick and yet the mood music continues to be downbeat. The 3-1 home win over an understrength Burnley barely salved the wounds of a dreadful performance and fortunate draw at Newcastle, a feast for amateur body language experts. Rangnick was an antsy sideline presence during the Burnley game, repeatedly urging his players to chase the “second ball” far harder. He has already shifted his 4-2-2-2 to something more akin to 4-4-2. Wolves did not play during the festive season but they will likely be harder to beat for United than two teams in the bottom three. Before Wolves’ hiatus, It look a last-minute goal for Liverpool to win at Molineux while Manchester City required a penalty to squeak past them. They don’t score many, but they don’t concede many either. John Brewin Rangnick says Cavani ‘definitely’ staying at United Whenever Newcastle return to action, the expectation is Eddie Howe will be able to pick from a far fuller deck, with Covid isolation periods ending, the injury list easing and a first tranche of Saudi Arabian loot spent on new players. The names linked most closely are not quite of the Kylian Mbappé and Neymar level just yet, but someone as accomplished and experienced as Kieran Tripper would add quality to their defence. Eddie Howe’s working relationship with the England full-back from their time at Burnley a decade ago may facilitate that deal but other transfers may be harder to pull off. Convincing players to join a team second-bottom of the league and with one win all season will take serious cash and powers of persuasion. The suspicion is Newcastle’s back office, with no director of football or chief executive yet appointed, lacks the expertise and contacts to bring in the players who might guarantee survival.

1/3/2022,"Cats have been effortlessly stealing scenes from their human co-stars for decades. Who could forget Audrey Hepburn’s adorable marmalade tabby in Breakfast at Tiffany’s? Or Jinx, the toilet-flushing Himalayan in Meet the Parents? Behind every famous film cat, there is a dedicated trainer patiently teaching them to obey a command, making sure they’re happy on set, and grooming them fastidiously to maintain their fluffy good looks. The film-makers behind The Electrical Life of Louis Wain, a British period biopic about the Edwardian artist and illustrator who became famous for his surreal portraits of cats, were adamant they didn’t want to use CGI for the shoot, so animal trainer Charlotte Wilde was brought in with 40 feisty felines. “It was organised chaos,” she says. “They had their own green room and were treated like royalty.”  Wilde, who has also worked on Fighting With My Family and Bohemian Rhapsody, runs a London agency that provides animals for film and TV. Felix, her 10-year-old black and white moggie (“a very cheeky chap!”), was cast as Peter, Wain’s furry best friend, who inspires his first sketches. Cats, of course, are notoriously fickle and independent – but that doesn’t mean they can’t be trained like dogs to behave and do tricks on screen. Wilde says she uses positive reinforcement with plenty of snacks on hand to dish out as rewards. “We teach our cats to go to mark,” she says. “They’ll walk in and they’ll know where to stop. We train them so they run to the sound of a buzzer. We’ve got some that can roll over. A couple can retrieve. They’ll lie down, rub against people’s legs, walk alongside someone. We show them what they’ve got to do. Then we try to make that happen on the take.” A clicker is used as encouragement. “You might have a moment in between a couple of lines where we can get a click in, just so the cat [knows]: ‘You’re doing really well. Wait. Food is coming.’ Obviously, that’s really distracting for actors. They’re probably sick of the sound of a clicker by the end of the film!” Mark Harden, an animal trainer based in Los Angeles, was in charge of the five snowy white Chinchilla Persians who played Snowbell in Stuart Little, and looked after 40 cats on the set of Catwoman including several rare Egyptian Maus. With cats, he says, it’s all about getting into their mindset. “They’re a predator but they can also be skittish. They’ve got a very strong flight reaction. The most important thing with a cat is desensitising them to strange environments. A movie set is a very strange environment.” Canadian animal trainer Melissa Millett has a novel way of desensitising the cats she works with: she stages mock film shoots at home. For the Pet Sematary reboot, she recruited five Maine Coons from rescue shelters to play Church, in the Pet Sematary reboot, who is transformed into an aggressive zombie cat. This meant gradually acclimatising them to wearing makeup and being wet. The whole process took two months. “We started with a catnip party in the bathtub. A little bit of water on the cat while it’s eating. Then we worked up to a full bath. Separately, we would start with a bit of egg white and then work our way up. All the products had to be edible.” Expectations for cat actors tend to be much lower than for dogs, says Harden. “People are more in awe of you when you have a good working cat. I guess they expect the cat to be scared.” Even so, animal trainers can teach cats to do the kind of tricks that would easily outshine Lassie. Millett has a talented Bengal named Sashimi, who can ride a scooter. Wilde taught one of her moggies, Leicester, to pretend to play the harmonica, while Harden trained Cairo, an Egyptian Mau, to pick up a mobile phone with his teeth and run off with it. But it’s not all cats being cute and cuddly on cue. Being bitten accidentally is an occupational hazard. Then there’s the cat hair that gets everywhere. “You certainly don’t wear your best clothes to work!” says Wilde. “You have to get up extra early because you’ve got to get the animals ready. You go to bed later because you’ve got to put them to bed. They come first no matter what. I’d say it’s a way of life rather than a job. It’s incredibly rewarding. They give you so much.”  The Electrical Life of Louis Wain is out in UK cinemas on 1 January.",Arts/Film,"What’s new, pussycat?

1/3/2022,"A milky-white and sky-blue stone hangs from a red string around Ethels Correa’s neck, and every so often she rubs it between her fingers. “When I feel anger, I grab this stone and I begin to relax, because they taught me how to breathe, to relax the body and to relax the mind,” she says. “I carry it with me all the time.”  Correa, 41, from the south coast of Honduras, is among a group on a visit to La Siguata, a healing centre for women like her who are suffering from trauma as a consequence of having stood up for human rights in the country. “When I came here, I felt old, wrinkled,” says Correa, a mother of five who has been involved in land struggles in her home town, Zacate Grande, for two decades. But now, when she looks in the mirror, she sees a different reflection. “I look beautiful.” Inaugurated earlier this year, the 10-day retreat at La Siguata is part of a tiny but growing movement led by the Mesoamerican Initiative of Women Human Rights Defenders, which funds this and another centre in Oaxaca, Mexico, addressing the mental health issues that come with working in one of the world’s most dangerous regions for activists and women. “We realised that there was lots of burnout and also strong impacts on women defenders as a result of structural violence, as well as patriarchal violence that was very invisible and normalised,” says Ana María Hernández of Casa La Serena healing centre in Oaxaca, Mexico, which opened in 2016 and has since welcomed hundreds of women from across the region. “The very demanding dynamics of women defenders’ activism means that we don’t have time to recover our energies, to connect with our bodies and needs. There is an imbalance between giving and receiving,” adds Hernández. Hernández and colleagues from the Consortium for Parliamentary Dialogue and Equity in Oaxaca developed a holistic approach to help women overcome trauma and recharge, so they can continue their work with renewed vigour. During their 10-day visits to the centres, women participate in activities from the artistic to the spiritual, in groups and individually, and are given a personalised self-care plan to take home. La Siguata – which means “the woman” in the Uto-Aztecan Nahuatl language – sits behind high walls in the pine-covered mountains above the capital Tegucigalpa. “Since entering that gate, I felt connected, I felt like a protected woman,” says Correa. Solidarity is a guiding principle of the centre, encapsulated by a motto adopted from the Garifuna culture of the country’s north coast, painted over its entrance. It translates as “You for me, me for you.” The grounds of flowers and fruit trees provide a stark contrast to the concrete landscape of the city below. The women can relax in hammocks or gather around a firepit surrounded by marigolds. “This space teaches us to love nature, to feel that energy of the earth and the air, which I had not experienced,” says Sandra Laínez, 63, a member of the Network of Domestic Workers, who were among the first group to visit La Siguata. The centre has facilities for massage, bathing and acupuncture. “I arrived with a lot of body pain and I didn’t feel well,” says Correa, who has suffered a lot of violence over her life, including a blow to the head that she says she was lucky to survive. “If I’m sick, then I’m no good to the organisation.” Inside the house are dormitories, a spacious kitchen where cooking lessons are held, and an altar with candles and flowers dedicated to environmentalist Berta Cáceres, murdered after years of threats over her opposition to a dam project. It provides a poignant reminder of the hostility towards activists in Honduras, a nation with the highest rate of femicide in Latin America. “In the midst of this struggle, we have lost our sisters and our comrades,” says Rebeca Girón, of the National Network of Women Human Rights Defenders, who runs La Siguata. The centre is also open to survivors of sexual abuse and families of disappeared migrants. In the near future, it is hoped that women from Nicaragua – where the government has brutally repressed dissent, resulting in more than 300 deaths during the wave of protests in 2018 alone – will be able to visit. “We know that these 10 days are not going to be the 10 days that will transform their lives, with sudden changes from one day to the next,” says Girón. “But we do consider that we open the way. “La Siguata represents the recovery of that internal flame of passion, for wanting to live again and even to enjoy human rights work anew.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,House of healing: the Honduran sanctuary for female rights defenders,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/03/house-of-healing-the-honduran-sanctuary-for-female-rights-defenders
1/3/2022,"Elise, a fiftysomething writer, has work that she enjoys, a husband of 23 years with whom she is “uncommonly happy”, and two grownup sons. If her life is uneventful, it’s also replete; she is content and (this is the more important thing) grateful for such contentment. But then, as if a heavy stone had been hurled into a tranquil pool, it happens. At a party, she meets Dagmar, and something inside her shifts. Back at home, she considers her body in the bathroom mirror and thinks vaguely of what it might be like to sleep with this woman – or anyone! – at this point in her life. It is unthinkable and yet, it’s about to happen. She and Dagmar start sending each other text messages. Quite soon after this, they go to bed with each other, and it is wonderful.  Elise doesn’t lie to her husband. She tells him that she doesn’t want to leave him, but that she cannot stop herself from seeing Dagmar, and he makes his decision: they separate, and he begins a new relationship. But freedom doesn’t make life any easier for Elise, and not only because she misses Henrik so badly. Dagmar has a wife and two children, and she will not leave them for Elise – though neither will she break off with her. Live in the moment, she tells her lover; be happy with what we’ve got. But what have they got? Conversations conducted on cold park benches. Snatched weekends that are over almost before they’ve begun. An endless, lonely present. Which would be worse, Elise asks herself: a life without Dagmar, or this half-life of longing and WhatsApp? Is a little bit of Dagmar, however small, really better than nothing at all? And if it is, what does this say about the rest of their lives? I adored Anneli Furmark’s last book, Red Winter, about love among radical leftists in northern Sweden, but I feel even more strongly about Walk Me to the Corner (translated by Hanna Strömberg). However painful to read, it captures so brilliantly both the unexpectedness of sudden desire in middle age – as Elise tells her son, she hadn’t realised that fiftysomething love would feel exactly the same as twentysomething love; that it would come with all the same ridiculous and paralysing uncertainties – and the utter misery that comes with falling for someone whose deeds simply do not match their words. Does Dagmar love Elise? She says she does. But will she give up anything for her at all? No, she will not. Furmark’s richly coloured drawings are sketchy, rough around the edges. But they’re wonderfully effective: I love the way she makes women’s bodies and faces look so seductively solid and generous; somehow, she imbues even everyday objects – a quilt, a coffee cup, a freshly laundered vest – with an incredible tenderness, as if these things, too, had feelings. Given the complexity of what she’s aiming to capture – all the agonising repetition of a lop-sided affair – her narration is amazingly concise, in part because she’s so very deft at incorporating the tiny screens of mobile phones into her story. How swiftly yearning reduces a lover’s world to the length and breadth of their malevolent/ecstatic glow. With what astonishing speed a heart comes to depend on a brief text message.

1/3/2022,"Everton are close to signing the right-back Nathan Patterson from Rangers for about £9.25m plus add-ons. The 20-year-old Scotland international is in line to become the club’s second January purchase after Vitaliy Mykolenko. Patterson is not a regular starter for Rangers but was identified by Rafael Benítez as a target when the manager took over last summer. Two Everton bids were rejected in that transfer window, with Steven Gerrard, the then Rangers manager, describing the initial £5m offer “a joke”.  Patterson’s arrival after that of Mykolenko would meet Benítez’s desire to strengthen in both full-back positions. Mykolenko, a Ukraine left-back, cost an initial £17.9m and the money being spent by Everton is a substantial upgrade on last summer, when the £1.7m Demarai Gray and free transfers were signed. Patterson has played six times for Scotland and scored on his most recent appearance, the 2-0 win in Moldova that guaranteed a place in March’s World Cup play-offs, in which Steve Clarke’s team face Ukraine in the semi-finals. Everton’s poor form – one win in 12 games – continued on Sunday with a home defeat by Brighton. There was again no place in the team for the left-back Lucas Digne, who is expected to leave this month after being ostracised by Benítez.",Sport/Football,Everton close to signing Rangers right-back Nathan Patterson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/everton-rangers-nathan-patterson-transfer-news
1/3/2022,"New year, new Rumour Mill, new Newcastle. At least, that’s the plan, with their new ownership having waited three long months to splash the cash on their plaything.  Among the first to come in looks likely to be Kieran Trippier, scorer of a World Cup semi-final goal for England and a La Liga winner with Atlético Madrid last season. What might attract him to a move to the north east? The word is a previous working relationship with Eddie Howe from their time together at Burnley. Who else might come in? Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, unloved at Arsenal but heading to the Africa Cup of Nations with Gabon, looks like a two-plus-two-equalling-five equation. Odion Ighalo, who plays his football in Saudi Arabia with Al Shabab, and must be gettable, is also at the Afcon with Nigeria. Which may leave Darwin Núñez of Benfica, though he may cost a premium of £50m and, as one of the hottest properties in the game, may need to be offered serious cash to fight out a relegation battle. Luis Díaz, Porto’s Colombian flier, is another player linked with Newcastle though Liverpool are also a possible destination should they wish to refresh their squad in the absence of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané at that soccer jamboree in Cameroon. And another possible Newcastle target – let’s face it, most of the footballing world is a target at this point – is Gabriel Barbosa of Flamengo: aka Gabigol. How about a defender? Sven Botman of Lille, the Dutch international, a Ligue 1 winner last season will cost £30m from a club willing to sell the 21-year-old, as they are short of cash. But is Botman willing to join? How about a midfielder? An emotional return for Georginio Wijnaldum, on big money but not playing much for Paris Saint-Germain? Seems unlikely, but all bets are off in the magical world of the January market. Meanwhile it is said that PSG would like to sign Chelsea-owned Crystal Palace tyro Conor Gallagher to play in midfield. Other clubs are available, and there is talk of a swap deal – like they ever come off – between Manchester United and Barcelona for Ousmane Dembélé and Anthony Martial. United’s long-term target is Declan Rice, but good luck in getting West Ham to sell in January. The Hammers, though, may be willing to spend some of the summer’s probable Rice cash – he is also wanted by Chelsea and Manchester City - on Rumour Mill favourite Adama Traoré, who also interests Tottenham. Any other Spurs business? Yes, the wild suggestion in Italy that unhappy Romelu Lukaku might want to join up with Antonio Conte to put an end to his Chelsea “nightmare”. With Manchester City running away with the Premier League and most of the big clubs keeping their powder dry before the summer, it may be a quiet market beyond Real Madrid’s continued interest in Kylian Mbappé. And that probably means this column should be thankful for Newcastle having money to burn.",Sport/Football,"Football transfer rumours: Trippier, Aubameyang and more to Newcastle?",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/football-transfer-rumours-newcastle-trippier-aubameyang-wijnaldum
