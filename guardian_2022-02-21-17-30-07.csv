2/21/2022,"There is a blueprint for how to beat Pep Guardiola’s ball-hoggers and it is publicly available: Crystal Palace employed it in October’s 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium and Tottenham did the same on Saturday: adopt a low block, stay patient while possession is maintained by the blue shirts and when the moment arrives, pounce by racing in behind the sluggish centre-backs. For Palace, Wilfried Zaha’s pace terrorised City; for Spurs it was Harry Kane and Son Heung-min . Why don’t more teams try this? Perhaps because executing lightning counter-attacks in the one or two opportunities allowed by City’s supreme passing machine is tough. But in an era of attack coaches, forensic video analysis, speedy forwards and training-ground drills there should be no excuse for more teams not attempting to exploit the glaring vulnerability. It may not always work, but this is currently the only realistic way to dismantle the league’s dominant side. Jamie Jackson  Match report: Manchester City 2-3 Tottenham It is often Sadio Mané’s fate to take second billing to Mohamed Salah and, even on a day when he scored one of his greatest goals and drew level with one of Liverpool’s favourite players, he was eclipsed again. Salah’s 150th goal overshadowed Mane’s 108th, but the latter meant the Senegal international had matched John Barnes’ total and in 160 fewer games. If comparisons between wingers feel inexact as the game has evolved – Barnes spent more time on the touchline, Mané loiters in the penalty area – it is worth noting that none of the younger man’s 108 are penalties. “Sadio’s goal record is definitely insane as well,” said Jürgen Klopp and while Salah should soon overhaul Michael Owen and then set off in pursuit of Kenny Dalglish, Mané could become Liverpool’s 11th highest scorer some time next season. Though, just outside the top 10, that could leave him obscured again. Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 3-1 Norwich Thomas Frank has been clear in marking next Saturday’s match against Newcastle as the day when Christian Eriksen, joyfully for anyone who loves football, is due to make his return to competitive action for Brentford. No pressure should be put on Eriksen to bounce straight back to his old levels; it is simply a marvel that we will be able to enjoy his talents again. But Brentford would benefit from even a fraction of his best form: they are not offering enough going forward and, until an undeserved Christian Norgaard consolation, failed to fashion a chance of note at the Emirates. Against a vastly improved Arsenal that is no disgrace, but they are noticeably short of someone who can roam between the lines and pick a pass. “Physically he is in a fine place, he looks better and better,” Frank said of Eriksen. Brentford’s season looks in need of the stimulus he could offer. Nick Ames Match report: Arsenal 2-1 Brentford Head injuries proved something of a theme as Manchester United won at Elland Road. Mercifully, Anthony Elanga was not badly hurt after a coin hurled from the crowd struck him on the head but it rather took the shine off an otherwise wonderful match. And that coin was far from the only missile aimed at Ralf Rangnick’s players; what if one had hit someone in an eye? Earlier Robin Koch, went off looking dazed and confused after initially attempting to play on with a head injury following a collision with Scott McTominay. Marcelo Bielsa afterwards said blood from a cut forced his replacement by Junior Firpo but Koch was only taken off after he sat down, clearly unable to continue. Bielsa may be correct but, from the stands, Koch looked like someone with a potential concussion. So why weren’t the protocols followed? Louise Taylor Match report: Leeds 2-4 Manchester United When Aaron Lennon returned to Burnley on a free transfer following a year in Turkey with Kayserispor, it almost passed without notice. Many will have anticipated the winger rarely being seen in a starting XI. His first league start of the season came on 2 October, his second on 30 December when he impressed at Old Trafford, scoring in a 3-1 defeat to Manchester United. Since then the veteran has proved himself worthy of a regular place in Sean Dyche’s team. At Brighton the 34-year-old was a constant threat against a fearful defence who became just the second team to concede three times to Burnley. Lennon played a key pass in the buildup to the first goal and was clinical when adding an emphatic third to seal the victory. Burnley’s squad lacks depth but the reigniting of Lennon’s career has improved Dyche’s options and created a rare battle for starting berths. Will Unwin Match report: Brighton 0-3 Burnley Joe Willock provided the decisive touch to secure a point at West Ham and the midfielder’s performance suggests he can be instrumental in keeping Newcastle in the Premier League. Willock’s instinctive finish was his first goal of the season and Eddie Howe eulogised his contribution. His permanent move to St James’ Park came after a successful loan spell from Arsenal in which he scored in six of Newcastle’s final seven matches last season. Willock’s energy and athleticism caused West Ham plenty of problems on Saturday and justified the decision to keep him in the team ahead of the new signing Bruno Guimarães. The 22-year-old’s dynamism was a major outlet for Newcastle as the team extended their unbeaten league run to six games. With Kieran Trippier and Allan Saint-Maximin injured, Willock’s attacking threat will be a significant asset in the coming weeks and, in this form, he should be able to help steer the team clear of trouble. Simon Mail Match report: West Ham 1-1 Newcastle ‘Graig Catchart’ may sound like an unlicensed video game alias but that was the name etched on to Manchester United’s honours board when Craig Cathcart was named the club’s young player of the year in 2007. With hindsight, it could be considered symbolic of the underappreciated career Cathcart has carved out for himself away from Old Trafford. Quietly excellent in Watford’s vital victory at Aston Villa on Saturday, Cathcart was consistently in the right place at the right time. His efforts ensured Ben Foster’s post-match YouTube recording was more labour-intensive than the 90 minutes that came before it. In the wider football world, Cathcart’s talents may go largely unrecognised. But not at Vicarage Road. Sam Dalling Match report: Aston Villa 0-1 Watford There was no shortage of underperformers for Everton in defeat at Southampton but the way they failed to service Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be of concern to Frank Lampard. The striker has not scored since returning from a four-month absence in January and Everton, who have not won away since August, failed to register a shot on target at St Mary’s. Calvert-Lewin is unlikely to be in the thick of the action against Manchester City on Saturday but Everton must offer some kind of thrust. “We can’t use Dominic as a battering ram,” Lampard said. “He has too much quality for that and I don’t want to play that way. It’s two-fold. Give Dominic time and make sure we give him the service and play around him as much as we can to get the benefit out of him and all the forward-end players.” Ben Fisher  Match report: Southampton 2-0 Everton Given the number of air miles his players clocked up last week in becoming world champions, it was no surprise that Thomas Tuchel welcomed the prospect of Chelsea’s next two fixtures being played in London after the late victory at Selhurst Park. The Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday at Wembley will be an opportunity for Tuchel to win his fourth trophy in less than 13 months at the helm but he must first face Lille in the first leg of Chelsea’s Champions League last-16 tie at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. The French club have the advantage of an extra day’s rest having played their Ligue 1 fixture against Metz on Friday night, although Tuchel is confident his players can handle the quick turnaround. “Playing Saturday-Tuesday should not be a problem for us, we are staying in London,” he said. “Sometimes it can cause an advantage when there is a tight schedule, but this time we should arrive home quite early, catch some good sleep and be ready to fight on a good level.” Ed Aarons Match report: Crystal Palace 0-1 Chelsea Adama Traoré was never the most productive attacker but when he was dispatched to Barcelona, the fear was that Wolves had lost a huge part of the counterattacking threat on which they so rely. Not so on the evidence of the last two games, which have seen Wolves amass six valuable points in two displays of undiluted efficiency. Key to both has been Daniel Podence, a tireless attacker whose scampering energy gives his side the perfect outlet. On Sunday, Podence often found himself the lone ranger in hopeful breaks, but time and again he showed the value of touch, pace and hardened know-how. Where Traoré might have run down a cul-de-sac, Podence drew a foul. Where Traoré might have crossed into an empty box, Podence played it simple. Traoré was one of the most exciting players in the league but Wolves are not in the business of exciting anyone. Efficiency may not be sexy, but it might just get Wolves into the Champions League.

2/21/2022,"The Australian defence force has confirmed an “increase in the use of lasers by some vessels” but regards the latest incident involving a Chinese warship as “more serious”, officials have revealed. Experts said the shining of a laser at an Australian surveillance aircraft by a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) warship last week represented an escalation from a previous incident in the South China Sea in 2019 when Australian helicopter pilots were forced to land as a precaution.  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Monday that “all the countries in our region” deserved an explanation from the Chinese government over activity he branded as “dangerous, unprofessional and reckless for a professional navy”. Labor also condemned the incident, after the ADF disclosed that a PLAN warship had used a laser to illuminate an Australian P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft on Thursday. The Australian aircraft had been tracking two PLAN vessels that were sailing east through the Arafura Sea, north of Australia. When asked by Guardian Australia to detail previous incidents, an ADF spokesperson said ADF assets operating across the Indo-Pacific region “have observed an increase in the use of lasers by some vessels”. “The increasing prevalence of the inappropriate use of lasers is concerning as it poses a potential safety risk to all those operating in the region,” the spokesperson said. “Defence deems this incident to be more serious than previous incidents.” Senior Australian diplomatic staff in Beijing have raised the latest incident with China’s ministries of foreign affairs and national defence, the spokesperson said. ADF and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials have also raised it with the Chinese embassy in Canberra. However, the responses have not been disclosed. Dr Euan Graham, a maritime security expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, said the Australian government’s response indicated that “this act has crossed a red line in terms of what Australia considers normal or acceptable and it’s decided to name and shame accordingly”. It was “an extremely serious incident” that risked “injury or worse”, Graham said. In 2019, Graham was one of several academics who travelled on HMAS Canberra from Vietnam to Singapore in the South China Sea, when helicopter pilots reported having lasers pointed at them. The Australian vessel was being tailed by Chinese warships – something that is “standard procedure” when foreign navies pass through areas that Beijing claims within the South China Sea – but there was no suggestion in that case that the lasers were shone by the Chinese military. Graham asked at the time whether it was “the sort of coordinated harassment more suggestive of China’s maritime militia”. Thursday’s incident was “obviously a step up” because it involved a military-grade laser and was clearly from a Chinese naval vessel, Graham said. That was why the Australian defence department had issued such a “robust response”. If pilots were “dazzled”, that could affect their ability to safely land the aircraft but Graham said the more serious possibility was the use of the laser could be a precursor to firing a weapon. The Chinese embassy has yet to comment. China’s Global Times newspaper cited an unnamed “analyst close to the PLA” as saying almost all modern warships “are equipped with laser rangefinders, which are a type of measurement tool used to tell distances between objects”. “They are also used for civilian purposes and are of little danger, the anonymous analyst said, noting that the Australian military knowingly hyped this with the aim of throwing mud at China,” the article said. Graham said the Chinese vessels were legally entitled to pass through the Arafura Sea and Australia was also legally able to monitor those ships but the use of the laser “puts the Chinese navy in a very bad light”. He said the likely motivation was “to create a distraction that would interrupt the Australian attempt to conduct its surveillance operations” and “make life difficult for the Australian pilots and to ward them off”. Prof John Blaxland, an expert in international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University also described the incident as an apparent “escalation”, as laser pointing could be “separated from firing a missile with hostile intent by a mere split second”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison told a Tasmanian radio station: “Could you imagine if that had been an Australian frigate going through the Taiwan Strait that pointed a laser at a Chinese surveillance aircraft, or indeed a British ship or a Japanese ship or an American, US ship, could you imagine what the reaction would be?” Labor urged the government to convey a strong bipartisan message of condemnation to Beijing and sought an “urgent” briefing. The incident comes amid heated debate about national security in the lead up to election due by May. In 2018, the US Department of Defense said two US airmen had suffered “minor” injuries as a result of the use of what the Pentagon believed were Chinese-deployed lasers in Djibouti.",News/Australia news,"Laser incident involving Chinese warship most serious in growing trend, ADF says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/laser-incident-involving-china-extremely-serious-australian-experts-say
2/21/2022,"Afigure sits alone on stage, dressed in comfy jumper and trousers, one leg crossed over the other. He slowly moves his hands and turns his head. But this sole performer in Uncanny Valley, by theatre company Rimini Protokoll, is not human. It is a lifelike animatronic model of the German writer Thomas Melle. The show’s director, Stefan Kaegi, had seen animatronics used in museums, where he found there was not sufficient time for what he calls the “empathy mechanism” to kick in. But he wondered what would happen if the robot became a performer, “someone with whom we start to identify”.  His idea was to create a monologue for a robot that looked as human as possible – not perfect but average and fragile. Evi Bauer, who worked on the robot’s design, suggested that the best way to make something irregular and flawed was to find a human subject and make a copy. The question was who? Melle had recently published The World at My Back, a philosophical exploration of his bipolar disorder that Kaegi had found intriguing. Melle, in turn, liked the idea of being made into a robot. The costume department at the Munich Kammerspiele theatre company took a silicone cast of Melle’s head – a particularly claustrophobic process documented in the production – and then there were, says Kaegi, some “spooky moments” for Melle meeting his robotic doppelganger. The result is undeniably disconcerting. Even though its inner workings are visible through a gap in the back of the robot’s head, its movements are delicate and somehow tender. Science fiction often shows us technology taking over but Kaegi needed to programme the robotic Melle’s every movement: “I wasn’t working with an artificial intelligence. I was working with a very dumb machine.” But then, he says, all of theatre is an exercise in programming, from lighting to sound. People, too, are largely preprogrammed in the ways we behave, including our routines and our small talk. The show asks how free we really are: “How dependent have we become not only on technical devices, but on algorithms that help us to take decisions?” The word “robot” was introduced into the English language by a play: RUR (Rossum’s Universal Robots), a 1920 drama by the Czech writer Karel Čapek. And in the 100 years since, they have become a staple of film and television. From Star Trek: The Next Generation to Battlestar Galactica, Ex-Machina to The Terminator, robots in popular culture are usually there, Kaegi observes, to play on our fears of technology taking control or as a way of exploring our own humanity. Despite – or, perhaps, because – of their un-humanness, performance makers have explored robots’ theatrical potential in numerous ways. The Serbian choreographer Dragana Bulut’s Future Fortune has dancers interacting with a humanoid robot, and the Japanese director Oriza Hirata’s Robot Theatre Project uses robot performers alongside human actors, juxtaposing superficially cute if affectless robots with expressive human bodies. Last year, to mark the centenary of RUR, a team of Czech scientists and dramaturgs created a new play written by computer. (The result featured lots of repetitive dialogue and a preoccupation with sex.) But plays that feature robots are thinner on the ground. Spillikin, by Pipeline theatre, explored the relationship between a woman with Alzheimer’s and her robot carer; Interference, a trio of speculative plays presented by the National Theatre of Scotland in 2019, also featured a story about an android carer. Tim Foley’s Electric Rosary, which opens at Manchester’s Royal Exchange in April, is set in a convent whose nuns welcome a robotic sister into their order. The idea for the play came to Foley on a visit to a monastery with his father, where he saw the ageing monks using quad bikes. He imagined a scenario where the nuns bring a robot in to do the cooking and cleaning but it “starts to get something out of it”. This robot is designed to learn by example so Foley explores not just the behaviour of other characters but “the agency and humanity that robots are developing themselves”. Like Kaegi, Foley is interested in patterns and programming. One of his inspirations was a book on mathematical sequences and the loops that underpin things. It could be argued, he says, that the saying of the rosary is a similar kind of loop. One of the reasons that robots don’t feature as often on stage as on screen, Foley suggests, is a practical one. Without access to CGI, you have to either create a robot – as in Spillikin – or have an actor play one. Each presents different challenges. For Electric Rosary, they opted for the latter approach. There won’t be any attempt to make the performer look like a robot with masks. Instead, Foley says, “it’s through speech and movement that she’ll show her artificial manner. But as time passes and she adapts to requirements, she’ll begin mimicking what it is to be human and then potentially mastering it”. Foley’s robot is ultimately a dramatic catalyst – a way of exploring the nature of faith. “If the idea is we’re constructed by a higher power,” asks Foley, “are we then a form of artificial intelligence? If we’re made in the image of God and a robot is made in ours, is there a hierarchy here? Or will we be equal in the eyes of God?” Uncanny Valley is at Battersea Arts Centre, London, 22 to 26 February; Electric Rosary is at Royal Exchange, Manchester, 23 April to 14 May.",Arts/Stage,Uncanny Valley: the moving one-man play – starring an animatronic robot,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/21/robots-theatre-uncanny-valley-thomas-melle-electric-rosary-tim-foley
2/21/2022,"Towards the end of last week, as a certain high-profile Sky Sports pundit insisted it was “no big deal” that he had not returned to Sunderland to resume a management career that has been on the backburner for over a decade, one of his former international teammates took charge of his first senior game. A big story in his native Ireland, it flew largely under the radar elsewhere. Eight years after he drew the curtain on his career in English football, Damien Duff might have questioned the wisdom of his decision to take on the manager’s role at the League of Ireland side Shelbourne as he strode down the “wrong” side of a touchline he patrolled with such distinction as a player for Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Newcastle United and Fulham. In surroundings that could scarcely have been less glamorous, he began his new life as a gaffer on a filthy Friday night in the Dublin suburb of Drumcondra, where Tolka Park was taking a pounding from the wind and rain.  For Duff, this maiden foray into management constituted an extremely big deal, the 42-year-old having openly admitted he was terrified by the prospect of taking over a famous old Dublin club that has in recent years fallen upon hard times. “Am I scared? Absolutely,” he’d told reporters at his unveiling in early November. “Do I feel uncomfortable? Absolutely. Going into the Shels first‑team role, is it going to be easy? No. Is it going to be comfortable? No. But it is going to give me 24/7 focus which is what I need. When I have an idle mind, like most people, it is not good for you.” A two-time Premier League champion who represented his country 100 times in a playing career bookended by spells at Shelbourne’s great Dublin rivals Shamrock Rovers, Duff had been keeping his mind ticking over since retirement in a variety of coaching roles. There were stints working behind the scenes at Celtic and the Republic of Ireland, as well as jobs whipping into shape underage sides at Rovers and his current club Shels. Not literally whipping, although he found himself in a minor spot of bother some years ago when some of the parents of his charges at Rovers took exception to the gruelling nature of a training regime which subjected their children to 6.30am starts and double sessions up to five times a week. “I get slaughtered, but that’s a dinosaur mentality,” Duff said when the issue was raised during an appearance as a pundit on RTE. “You have to train five times a week.” More pertinently, the kids didn’t mind. While Duff’s pedigree as a player should go a long way towards convincing his adult charges, many of them part-timers supplementing their incomes with second jobs, to buy into the kind of work ethic that might make even a taskmaster as notorious as Marcelo Bielsa blanche, the club they represent will be unable to afford the kind of back room personnel and recovery aids all English Premier League clubs take for granted. Only a few days ago, Duff revealed his managerial duties have stretched to finding accommodation and part-time work for his many new recruits, while taking others to hospital in his car for scans. “I haven’t had one day where it’s been a clear easy ride,” he said more than three months after taking the job. “There’s always been some shit to deal with. More often than not, more than one piece of shit.” A household name working in a league where most players and managers habitually go unrecognised by the wider public outside their own front doors, Duff is working on an extremely tight budget at a club that was once a powerhouse of Irish football but has spent much of the past decade yo-yoing in and out of the League of Ireland’s top flight. On a two-year contract, his immediate priority is keeping them in the Irish Premier League, even if he has already conceded “Shels will lose an awful lot of games” this season. Their first reverse, a 3-0 defeat at home to St Patrick’s Athletic in front of a capacity 4,100 crowd, is already on the board. A deep thinker and perfectionist who demands the highest possible standards from his players on and off the pitch, Duff originally turned down the Shels job, because at the time he was offered it he was enjoying life on holiday with his family in the south of France and the thought of all the hassle it might entail simply did not appeal. Given a couple of days to mull over his decision, he soon changed his mind. Despite being financially secure after a playing career in which he earned tens of millions, he felt compelled to demonstrate the courage of convictions – the importance of bravery and stepping out of one’s comfort zone – he was preaching to his own two children and the under-17s he was coaching at Shelbourne each day. “I am bottom of the tree,” he told reporters. “I am not the best manager in the league. I have an awful lot to prove. In my first session with the Shelbourne first team I will probably be using bits from José Mourinho from 20 years ago. I will never change. I am still energetic, emotional. The players will soon learn that I never try being anything I am not.” While learning the gospel of José from 20 years ago is likely to be more beneficial to Shelbourne’s players than any teachings the Portuguese has espoused in recent years, Duff has insisted that “if there’s a bottle out of place, I’m not going to say I’ve had enough of Shelbourne Football Club”. This suggests he might also have absorbed a nugget or two regarding the kind of managerial missteps he ought not to take from his former international skipper Roy Keane.",Sport/Football,Damien Duff takes bold first step into management at Tolka Park | Barry Glendenning,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/21/damien-duff-takes-bold-first-step-into-management-at-tolka-park
2/21/2022,"The American national anthem may tout the country as the “land of the free”, but the legitimacy of that statement is becoming increasingly stretched in 2022, as conservatives have launched a concerted campaign to prevent ideas and books from being presented to schoolchildren. Republicans in several states have launched efforts to ban books pertaining to race and LGBTQ+ issues from classrooms, while some legislatures are pushing to introduce laws which would ban teachers from discussing homosexuality. Other states have already banned discussion of the modern-day impact of historic racism in the US.  It is a situation that has no parallel in America’s recent history. And in an interview with the Guardian, Stephanie Nossel, CEO of PEN America, a non-profit organization that works to protect freedom of expression in the US, said the efforts to censor education, in particular, fit in with a wider attempt by conservatives to influence society. “There have been battles and debates that have bubbled up from time to time but the ferocity of this wave of both the education gag orders affecting curricular and book bans is unprecedented,” Nossel said. “We’re in this pitched moment of historically unprecedented polarization in our country and there is a very potent and intense struggle under way about what the future of our society looks like,” Nossel said. There are few signs that US polarization will decrease any time soon. Democrats and Republican politicians are deeply divided over issues around education, social care, women’s rights and the pandemic recovery, while only a fifth of Republicans believe Joe Biden was legitimately elected, despite a lack of evidence of widespread election fraud. In January an NBC News poll found that 70% of Americans believe the country has become so polarized it can no longer solve major issues facing the country. “Our population is changing. We’re becoming an increasingly pluralistic society, along so many different dimensions and there’s this fierce backlash trying to kind of yank it in the other direction, with the notion that we’re somehow restoring some great path that’s been lost. “We see that in efforts to curtail voting rights across the country and to empower legislatures to overrule the will of an increasingly diverse population that go to the polls.” That crusade is increasingly bleeding into education. In the last year, PEN America counted 155 bills introduced in 38 states that would censor what teachers can say or teach in classrooms. In 2022 there has been a “steep rise” in the introduction of what PEN America calls “gag orders”, the organization said. In Florida a “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which would ban discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, was passed by the state senate’s education committee on 8 February, and has been endorsed by Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor. The bill, which must pass the full Florida senate and the house before becoming law, would allow parents to file lawsuits against school boards if they believe policies violate the law. A bill introduced in the Kansas house on 9 February would change the state’s obscenity law, making it a class B misdemeanor for a teacher to use any material which depicts “homosexuality” in a classroom, while looming legislation in Arizona would allow parents to sue teachers and school districts for perceived violations of parental rights. In schools, these laws serve to “hobble our educators, and intimidate them in a chilling way”, Nossel said. “It puts librarians, teachers, principals in a position of having to fear that if they put forward certain ideas, or even if a student puts forward certain ideas, and it gets taken up as a classroom discussion, that they may be subject to discipline or punishment or fines.” While classroom censorship has become an eagerly embraced hobbyhorse for conservatives, there is little evidence that a majority of parents are demanding more censorship in the classroom or demanding more influence over what their children can read, or be taught. A CNN poll in early February found that only 12% of Americans believed parents “should have the most sway over which library books are on the shelves and how American history is taught”. “I think it’s a manufactured issue, to be honest. There aren’t a lot of parents who are rifling through their child’s backpack in horror to discover, you know, a copy of Art Spiegelman’s Maus,” Nossel said. “I think there are some activists who have realized that by pointing out, whether it’s profanity or controversial ideas in some of these books, they can activate a sense of frustration that parents do have about a range of issues.” Those issues include the debate about wearing masks in schools, and mixed emotions about the length of pandemic-era school closures. But censorship has also been pushed by conservative groups linked to deep-pocketed rightwing donors. Groups like Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education have been instrumental in book banning attempts in the US, often presenting themselves as small, “grassroots” efforts, while in reality they have links to prominent, wealthy Republicans. Existing tensions, Nossel said, have “been used to fuel this ideological debate over books and to fire it up”. “We used to talk about a pocketbook issue here in the United States, an issue that affects people’s pocketbooks. “This is an issue that affects the backpack. It affects something that’s in the home, that’s very personal and close to home. And so, I think the organizers and the activists feel like they’ve been able to strike a nerve with this, even though the backdrop of parental concern over what’s being read and taught in schools is relatively low.’ There may be no recent parallel for the scale of the conservative crackdown. Nossel, whose book Dare to Speak: Defending Free Speech for All, serves as a guide to protecting and promoting free speech, said the clearest similarity to the potential prosecution of teachers is from almost 100 years ago, in the Scopes trial, involving the Tennessee science teacher John Scopes. In 1925 Scopes was accused of violating Tennessee’s recently passed Butler Act, which made it illegal to teach the theory of evolution in public schools. He was found guilty and fined $100, although the verdict was later overturned. After the trial Mississippi passed a similar law, and in the same year Texas banned evolution theory from school textbooks. More recent parallels can be found in the policing of books and ideas in the Soviet Union, and Russia introduced a “gay propaganda” law in 2013 which in effect made it illegal to equate straight and gay relationships. China has long banned the book Tombstone, Yang Jishen’s recounting of the Great Chinese Famine, which casts a negative light on the country’s communist rulers. Nossel said it would be going too far to directly equate the situation in the US to those countries – “We’re a democracy here, and that’s extremely important,” she said – but she warned there is an “echo in the tactics”. “Those situations, obviously, were far, far more severe. But I think we have to be on guard,” Nossel said. “A lot of us have been surprised about what we’ve witnessed in this country over the last several years. So we can’t be too sanguine about this just being sort of a phase, and a passing trend.”",News/World news,Books bans and ‘gag orders’: the US schools crackdown no one asked for,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/books-bans-gag-orders-suppress-discussion-racism-lgbtq-us-schools
2/21/2022,"Janet Hock is a former dentistry professor who lives in Indianapolis. She is also an avid scuba diver, with a long love of the ocean. “We plod around on Earth, but there’s this whole other world that teems with life – or used to,” she says. So when Hock, 77, updated her will in 2020, she added that she wanted to become part of a coral reef when she died. The unusual request means her cremated remains will be mixed into a perforated concrete dome, known as a reef ball. She will then become part of an artificial reef, having a second life on the seabed.  “You’re providing structure for fish to swim through and a place for plants to grow,” says Hock. “My first impression was that they’re really ugly. Then I thought: ‘Oh, it would be so nice to be down there, with little orange fish darting through the holes in my ball.’” The service is provided by Eternal Reefs, a Florida-based charity that says it offers a “way to give back after life by replenishing the dwindling natural reef systems”. It places reef balls made of pH-neutral concrete, along with human ashes, in regulated areas of the seabed around the US. Family and friends are given the GPS coordinates of where their loved one’s “grave” is located. The charity says it has seen the number of requests triple during the pandemic, mostly from people who love the sea – and the notion that in death they can help regenerate marine life. A desire to return to the ocean goes back millennia, with evidence of sea burial in ancient Egypt and Rome. In the South Pacific, bodies would be placed in canoes and pushed out to sea, while scattering ashes in the ocean has long been widely practised in Asia. And tales of fallen Viking heroes’ boats set ablaze have persisted in popular culture. Today, the idea of an ocean burial chimes with a search for eco-friendly alternatives to traditional burial and cremation. While the reef model still requires cremation, the idea is that the structures will help restore marine habitats by mimicking some characteristics of a coral reef. Most of the world’s reefs are at risk – from ocean warming and acidification, pollution and overfishing – according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Reefs are essential to protect shorelines and maintain marine ecosystems, as well as providing work for local communities and even helping scientists to produce new medicines. Eternal Reefs works with the Reef Ball Foundation and Reef Innovations, which constructs the balls. At more than a metre high and two metres wide and weighing 250kg-1,800kg (550lb-4,000lb), the balls have a rough surface that allows marine plants and animals such as corals and algae to grow on them. The organisation has so far sunk close to 3,000 memorial reefs across about 25 sites, from Texas to New Jersey. Murray Roberts, professor of marine biology at Edinburgh University’s school of geosciences, thinks it is a good idea. “Corals and all sorts of animals grow better on structure,” he says. “I can’t see an obvious downside.” Roberts says incorporating human ashes into artificial reefs could help shield them from destruction, as well as highlighting the damage we do to the ocean. “When you have artificial reefs that contain human remains, imagine the consternation there would be if that area was trawled up,” he says. Dr Ken Collins, of Southampton University’s National Oceanography Centre, agrees. “It is a designated bit of seabed which remains undisturbed,” he says. Collins, whose specialism is artificial reefs, sees no problem with marine concrete and is involved in a UK memorial reef himself. “Any impact disappears within days,” he says. Eternal Reefs says the money people such as Hock pay for reef balls – which cost between $3,000 and $7,500 (£2,200-£5,500) – helps fund more artificial reefs. “We consider ourselves to be reef-builders. [That’s] what our goal is,” says George Frankel, chief executive of Eternal Reefs. “And we’re using memorialisation as the tool.” It is not the only such project in the ocean: the company behind the Neptune Memorial Reef, in Florida, says it “creates life after life” in the ocean and also provides memorials made of concrete and cremated remains, which cost from $1,295, to generate funding. “Building a reef costs money – lots of it,” says Jim Hutslar, its operations director. Hutslar says the artificial reef is home to 56 species of fish, as well as crabs, sea urchins, sponges and coral. When complete, it will comprise 250,000 memorials covering more than 6.5 hectares (16 acres), making it one of the world’s largest human-made reefs. The idea has also been adopted in Dorset, as part of a scheme to attract divers to the county. Two local divers, Marcus Darler and Sean Webb, gained permission from the Crown Estate (the monarchy owns the UK seabed) to obtain a square-kilometre site off the coast of Weymouth and Portland for a reef to help regenerate the local lobster population, as well as act as a dive site. “To help with funding, we came up with the idea of Solace Reefs,” Darler says. With Collins’ support, they created perforated domes out of crushed Portland limestone and human ashes. Since 2014, they have deposited 16. After diving around the site, a marine biologist reported: “There was a real diversity of invertebrates covering the stones […] it has become a new ecosystem.” Both Frankel and Hutslar say many people are interested in replicating the model. “I get calls on a regular basis,” Frankel says. “The problem is they all think it’s a get-rich-quick scheme.” Still, he says there’s “no question in my mind that it will be mainstream”. Not everyone is convinced, however. The model still involves cremation, which, on average, releases 400kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for each body. “If people want to seriously make a difference, then don’t choose cremation,” says Rosie Inman-Cook, manager of the Natural Death Centre charity. “Cremation is a disaster.” The artificial reefs also use concrete, the manufacture of which is responsible for up to 8% of global CO2 emissions. Concrete has a huge environmental cost, says Michael Steinke, a marine biologist at Essex University, “so from that point of view it might not be the best idea, if you’re really environmentally minded.” Inman-Cook is wary of what she calls “gimmicky” burial products and services. Environmental concerns have led to quirky innovations, from “living coffins” made from mushroom fibre, to egg-shaped “seed” urns, which grow a tree on your remains. “It’s tinkering at the edges,” she says, arguing that such ideas are a distraction from more fundamental changes needed. Inman-Cook says natural burial is best for the environment. Hock says she was also sceptical about some of the new ideas for burial, but was impressed by the marine life living on some of the new reefs and felt it would be less difficult for her family than tending to a grave. “The video I watched showed how quickly these peculiar-looking balls were repopulated with fish, so the concept seemed to work,” she says. “It appeals to me – the thought of regrowing something that’s been destroyed.”",News/Environment,Reef ball burials: the new trend for becoming ‘coral’ when you die,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/21/reef-ball-burials-the-new-trend-for-becoming-coral-when-you-die
