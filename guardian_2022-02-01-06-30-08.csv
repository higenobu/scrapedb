2/1/2022,"Liz Truss has tested positive for Covid, shortly after sitting in a packed House of Commons without wearing a mask. Writing on Twitter on Monday evening, the foreign secretary said: “I tested positive for Covid this evening. Thankfully I’ve had my three jabs and will be working from home while I isolate.”  After the session in the Commons, during which she gave a statement about Russia, Truss also attended a packed meeting with Boris Johnson, Tory MPs and ministers on Monday evening at Portcullis House in Westminster, where she also did not wear a face mask. All members of the parliamentary Conservative party were invited to the meeting, with the rooms reportedly being so full that some MPs left early. Very few Tory MPs, including on the Commons frontbench, wore masks in the Commons on Monday; the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and health secretary, Sajid Javid, were notable exceptions. Truss was due to travel to Ukraine with the prime minister on Tuesday to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky amid rising tensions with Russia, and was also supposed to meet Maroš Šefčovič, the vice-president of the EU Commission for Interinstitutional Relations, later this week to work on reaching “a solution to the NI protocol that works for all sides”, as the foreign secretary put it earlier on Monday. Her announcement comes hours after the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said he had tested positive for the virus. “Yesterday I tested positive for Covid and will therefore be watching my brilliant colleagues at oral questions today instead,” he tweeted on Monday morning. “Thankfully, I’ve had my three jabs and will be working from home while I isolate.”",News/Politics,Liz Truss tests positive for Covid after speaking in packed Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/liz-truss-tests-positive-for-covid-after-speaking-in-packed-commons
2/1/2022,"Craig Kelly has signalled the United Australia party could throw a political lifeline to incumbent MPs prepared to break ranks and support two new private members bills he will bring forward during the final sitting weeks of parliament. The UAP plans to put all sitting members of parliament last on its how-to-vote cards in the coming federal election – a strategy prompting significant anxiety among Morrison government MPs, given the Coalition was the primary beneficiary of preference flows in the 2019 election.  But Kelly, the former maverick Liberal, and now UAP leader, says his party’s “pox on all your houses” strategy could well change depending on where MPs line up in the final sitting weeks. “If in the final couple of weeks of parliament, if people stand up and argue for the things I’ve been supporting, we might think whether or not we preference them last,” Kelly told Guardian Australia. Kelly confirmed that two Morrison government MPs had already made themselves exceptions to the UAP’s planned preference lockout. He said Queenslander Llew O’Brien would be backed at the coming election, because O’Brien had supported an effort to bring on debate about his private member’s bill to prohibit commonwealth, state and territory governments and other non-government entities from issuing domestic Covid-19 vaccine passports. O’Brien’s Queensland colleague, George Christensen, would also get UAP preferences in the event he chose to run again in the seat of Dawson, Kelly said, because of his support on many issues. Kelly’s very obvious attempt to foment ill-discipline ahead of parliament’s resumption follows the government’s managerial difficulties in the last sitting weeks of 2021. The Morrison government struggled to keep its program on the rails because a group of government senators refused to support routine legislation. Lower house MPs also crossed the floor to support crossbench proposals. As MPs prepare to return to Canberra for the final sitting weeks, there has been a run of bad polls suggesting the Coalition could lose any election held today. The Morrison government was a significant beneficiary of preference flows from the UAP and One Nation at the 2019 federal election. Labor strategists in Queensland are hoping the Clive Palmer backed-UAP holds firm on preferencing sitting members of parliament last, because the ALP currently holds only a handful of seats in the state. Kelly said his open invitation for colleagues to break ranks in the final couple of parliamentary weeks also applied also to Labor MPs. “This deal goes all ways,” he said. The UAP leader says he intends to bring forward two private members bills during the pre-election sittings. The first bill would curtail the powers of the immigration minister to “arbitrarily revoke a visa”. Kelly pointed to the recent deportation of international tennis star Novak Djokovic as a case in point. Kelly declared the Morrison government had “done what was popular at the time” by sending the tennis star packing, but he claimed decisions like deporting a high-profile visitor because of their “views on a contemporary subject” had “serious consequences” for tourism and for Australia’s ability to secure major events. He said the second bill would be a reboot of his legislation stopping commonwealth, state and territory governments and other non-government entities from issuing domestic Covid-19 vaccine passports. Kelly said he would attempt to apply that prohibition to three vaccinations rather than two. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is pushing via national cabinet to change the definition of fully vaccinated to mean three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, which would pave the way for changes to vaccine mandates, which Kelly opposes. The prime minister has not opposed the definitional change being sought by Andrews and some of the other premiers. But sources report Morrison has asked a number of questions during recent meetings with his state and territory counterparts about the practical impact of the new definition. Vaccine mandates are highly contentious with elements of the Coalition’s base. Political parties like the UAP, the Liberal Democrats and One Nation are courting disaffected Coalition voters by fomenting a community backlash against vaccine mandates. Anti-mandate protesters marched on parliament house in Canberra on Monday, prompting police to lock down the public entrances.",News/Australia news,Craig Kelly floats preference offer for Coalition MPs who break ranks in parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/craig-kelly-floats-preference-offer-for-liberal-mps-who-break-ranks-in-parliament
2/1/2022,"Boris Johnson may have been cast by his supporters as a “big dog” – but many of his fellow Tory MPs see themselves as frogs. They use the analogy of the amphibian which, placed in a pot of boiling water, would immediately leap out – but finds itself withstanding incredibly high temperatures if the heat is turned up more slowly. In this case, the gradually rising temperature is the drip-drip of sleaze, cost of living crises and Downing Street parties.  So on Monday it was with a heavy heart that some MPs admitted they had finally reached boiling point with “partygate”, unable to contain their rage at a dozen lockdown gatherings being investigated by the Metropolitan police and a redacted official report. A string of former cabinet ministers – and Johnson’s predecessor as prime minister – lined up in the Commons to publicly unleash their views on a Downing Street operation criticised by Sue Gray’s report for its “serious failure” to observe strict lockdown laws. The mood was combative. One MP described it as like a “boxing match”, another said “tribalism” had set in and Johnson was starting to be better propped up by his backbenchers. But however many impassioned speeches were made in defence of his Brexit credentials, the Covid vaccine rollout or commitment to “levelling up”, Johnson was wounded multiple times by interventions by some heavy hitters in the party. Theresa May, who tends to deliver sparse but withering attacks on Johnson, said people “had a right to expect their prime minister to have read the rules, to understand the meaning of the rules” and “set an example”. She believed Gray’s report was clear No 10 “was not observing the regulations they had imposed on members of the public” and accused Johnson of either not understanding the rules or believing they did not apply to his team. “Which was it?” she asked. Other grandees who took aim at Johnson included two former chief whips. The first, an emotional Andrew Mitchell, said he had given Johnson his “full-throated support” for 30 years but confessed to being “deeply concerned” by the prime minister’s previous denials of any wrongdoing at the dispatch box. Recalling a private conversation he had with Johnson 10 days earlier, Mitchell said he had told the prime minister “he should think very carefully about what was now in the best interests of our country and of the Conservative party” and added: “I have to tell him he no longer enjoys my support.” Mark Harper, another Tory MP who was once in charge of party discipline, said many people had questioned Johnson’s “honesty, integrity and fitness to hold that office”. His insistence that Johnson publish the full Gray report once the Met’s criminal inquiry has concluded was shared widely by other backbenchers, and led the government to U-turn in a matter of hours. Although the nearly 90-minute debate was often raucous and punctuated by cheers and brays, silence was observed for a speech made by Aaron Bell. He talked of attending his grandmother’s funeral in May 2020 – when two gatherings investigated by Gray happened in No 10, one of which is being probed by police. Bell recalled the “wonderful woman” whose funeral in Kent, with only 10 people, was a three-hour drive from Staffordshire. All other mourners had to watch online. “I didn’t hug my siblings, I didn’t hug my parents, I gave the eulogy and then afterwards I didn’t even go to her house for a cup of tea,” Bell said. “Does the prime minister think I’m a fool?” Although Johnson managed to avoid the resignations that helped bring down May’s administration, he did suffer one MP quitting as a ministerial aide. Angela Richardson, a parliamentary private secretary to Michael Gove, wrote in a social media post that she felt “deep disappointment” it had “taken so long” to get an acknowledgment of wrongdoing and an apology. Despite the challenging attacks from colleagues, it was still unclear if enough MPs would write no-confidence letters to trigger a ballot on Johnson’s future. Behind the scenes, Tory backbenchers said they thought Johnson had been in a weaker position the day before Christian Wakeford’s defection to Labour. One senior Conservative called Johnson a “bastard” who would “probably wiggle off the hook”. A backbencher, part of the so-called “pork pie plotters”, appeared in retreat, conceding the struggle to oust the prime minister was now a “long-game” and adding there “won’t be a queue” outside the office of Sir Graham Brady, the holder of no-confidence letters. Another MP said Gray’s pared-back report “looks like a smoking gun, but we’ll be waiting a while for the coroner”. While Johnson tried to shore up support on Monday night, he chose to address all MPs rather than only backbenchers as usual. A Tory source drily noted: “I’d want the moral support of the payroll if I was Boris having to face down the backbenchers right now.”",News/Politics,Tory MPs are frogs in boiling water amid Johnson’s ‘partygate’ defence,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/tory-mps-are-frogs-in-boiling-water-amid-johnsons-partygate-defence

2/1/2022,"Boris Johnson has been left desperately trying to shore up his premiership after the Sue Gray report as detectives were revealed to be investigating 300 photos and 12 events in Downing Street, including a party in the prime minister’s private flat. Johnson faced a wall of anger from Conservative MPs in the House of Commons after Gray’s investigation concluded that many of the 16 parties were “difficult to justify” and condemned “failures of leadership and judgment” in No 10 and the Cabinet Office.  Scotland Yard officers have obtained more than 300 photographs and 500 pages of documents. The images include pictures taken at alleged parties and from security-system cameras showing people entering and exiting buildings, the Guardian understands. Tory grandees were among those who made stinging interventions criticising Johnson’s conduct, with his predecessor, Theresa May, questioning his comprehension of the rules and the former chief whip Andrew Mitchell saying the prime minister no longer had his support. Angela Richardson, a Tory aide, said she had resigned her government job last week citing “disappointment” with the prime minister, while Aaron Bell, an MP from the 2019 intake, gave an emotionally charged speech accusing Johnson of making him look like a fool after he stuck to the rules during his grandmother’s funeral. However, Johnson appeared to have staved off an immediate challenge by pledging a shakeup of his Downing Street operation and belatedly promising to publish Gray’s full blow-by-blow account of the parties once the police have finished investigating. He later made a rare address to all his MPs, announcing changes to his No 10 staff in the coming days. He suggested that his former election guru, Sir Lynton Crosby, would be returning to help in an unofficial role. Conservatives were initially dismayed by Johnson’s defiant Commons performance in which he refused to commit to publishing Gray’s full report, which was redacted following the announcement of a Metropolitan police inquiry. But after former ministers including Mark Harper and Tobias Ellwood pressed him for a full and unredacted publication, he was forced into a U-turn. Several Tory MPs opposed to the prime minister’s continued leadership said they were witnessing “death by 1,000 cuts” and questioned why more of their colleagues were not submitting letters of no confidence. At least 54 are needed for a ballot on Johnson’s leadership, but even sharp critics like Mitchell are not believed to have handed in letters. One MP said Johnson’s determination to keep fighting meant removing him would be “extremely painful” and cause huge damage to the party, while another said it was clear Tory MPs would at some point need to “get the screwdrivers out to prise his hands off the doors of Downing Street”. The 12-page Gray report identified “failures of leadership and judgment” but left many questions unanswered, including whether Johnson had misled the Commons by denying parties took place and saying all Covid rules were followed. Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, was thrown out of the Commons for breaching protocol by repeatedly accusing the prime minister of having “lied and misled” parliament.MPs said the most damaging allegation was of a party on 13 November 2020, the evening that former aide Dominic Cummings quit, in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s flat. There had been reports of loud music and partying heard in the press office below and the alleged gathering is now under police investigation. The prime minister refused to tell parliament whether he was present in the flat that evening. He had previously denied in the Commons that any party took place on that date. Johnson was also present for at least one other of the parties under investigation by police – the “bring your own booze” affair in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said: “There can be no doubt that the prime minister himself is now subject to criminal investigation.”Johnson rebuffed questions about his own conduct, but promised to overhaul the structure of No 10 to address some of Gray’s criticisms. “I get it and I will fix it,” he told MPs. He also sought to turn his fire on the opposition by making discredited claims about Starmer having failed to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile when he was director of public prosecutions. One cabinet minister said there was significant concern about the continued centralisation of No 10, however: “One of the reasons this situation has evolved has been a reluctance from some people around the PM to take outside advice.” Another senior minister said: “Departments are constantly frustrated by nameless people in No 10 – is this the moment to add another layer of them.” Tory MPs initially said they were unimpressed by Johnson’s Commons performance and accused him of misjudging the mood – but many are continuing to withhold judgement until the Met investigation is complete, a new test of whether Johnson will personally get a sanction for breaching Covid rules. In her report, Gray did not criticise the prime minister personally or pass judgment on his past statements, but she highlighted failures at the heart of government. Gray listed 16 gatherings on 12 dates across 20 months in 2020-21 that she had examined for evidence of rule-breaking, of which 12 are being investigated by police. Gray said her report was limited by the Met’s request for her to make only minimal reference to gatherings that they were investigating. She said she had decided not to publish factual accounts of the other four dates as she did not feel able to do so without detriment to the overall balance of findings. It is understood that a more detailed full report currently exists and that Gray is keen to see that put into the public domain. Mark Harper, the former chief whip, said he was still uneasy about the prime minister’s commitment to publishing the full document, saying that Johnson had to commit “at the despatch box”.",News/Politics,Gray finds ‘failure of leadership’ at No 10 as police investigate 300 photos,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/gray-finds-a-failure-of-leadership-at-no-10-as-police-investigate-300-photos-boris-johnson
2/1/2022,"Ukraine will be responsible for its own destruction if it undermines existing peace agreements, a senior Russian diplomat has warned at a UN security council debate on the crisis.  Vasily Nebenzya on Monday derided western claims of a planned Russian attack as “hysterics” and blamed Ukraine for not abiding by the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were supposed to end the conflict between the Kyiv government and the Russian-backed separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Nebenzya, Russia’s permanent representative at the UN, also blamed western nations for “actively pumping Ukraine full of weapons” which he said would be used against civilians in the east of the country and were “in violation of the Minsk agreements”. He ended his address to the security council with a warning. “If our western partners push Kyiv to sabotage the Minsk agreements, something that Ukraine is ... willingly doing, then that might end in the absolute worst way for Ukraine,” Nebenzya said. “And not because somebody has destroyed it, but because it would have destroyed itself and Russia has absolutely nothing to do with this.” The US had called for an emergency debate on Ukraine as part of a diplomatic campaign to fend off what Washington and its allies say is a planned Russian invasion of Ukraine. As part of that campaign, the US and the UK both announced that pro-Putin Russian oligarchs would be targeted if an attack goes ahead. Russia had sought to stop a security council debate on Ukraine until after it took over the council presidency on Tuesday. But only China supported its opposition, with Gabon, India and Kenya abstaining, leaving the US with more than the nine votes required to proceed with an open session on the crisis. In her remarks, the US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that even as the issue was being debated in New York, Russia continued to add to the more than 100,000 troops already massed around Ukraine’s borders, and within days would have 30,000 inside Belarus alone. “Russia has already used more than 2,000 rail cars to move troops and weaponry from across Russia to the Ukrainian border,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russia has also moved nearly 5,000 troops into Belarus, with short-range ballistic missiles, special forces and anti-aircraft batteries. We’ve seen evidence that Russia intends to expand that presence to more than 30,000 troops near the Belarus-Ukraine border, less than two hours north of Kyiv, by early February.” Speaking towards the end of the session, the Ukrainian envoy, Sergiy Kyslytsya, described the Russian build-up of troops and military hardware around his country’s borders and did not echo President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s complaints that the West was exaggerating the threat. Kyslytsya said there were now 112,000 Russian troops massed around Ukraine’s borders and in Crimea, with another 18,000 deployed at sea off the country’s coast. He pointed to the sophistication of the weapons being gathered in Belarus, including Iskander missiles, Pantsir anti-aircraft systems and advanced Sukhoi-35 jet fighters. Kyslytsya also said Russia was bolstering paramilitary separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, which he estimated as 35,000-strong, including 3,000 Russian troops “in command posts and in other critical combat positions”. In naval exercises in the Black Sea which started last week, the Ukrainian envoy said the Russians had deployed frigates, battleships, missile ships, assault landing ships and minesweepers. Another six battleships from Russia’s northern fleet were reported to have entered the Mediterranean on Monday. According to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica, the vessels are carrying 60 tanks and more than 1,500 soldiers. The warships are currently navigating in the Sicilian Channel under aerial surveillance from Nato planes. Ukraine’s former defense minister, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, said that if the ships entered the Black Sea, the odds would tip on the likelihood of a Russian attack. In his comments to the security council, Nebenzya insisted that the military exercises were nothing out of the ordinary. “The deployment of Russian troops within our own territory has frequently occurred on varying scales before and has not caused any hysterics whatsoever,” he said, claiming that Russian troops were “in their own areas of deployment and barracks where they were before”. Military analysts studying satellite imagery of the buildup in Belarus say the military units are coming from Russia’s far east and their deployment in such large numbers so far from base is unprecedented since the cold war. The Belarus envoy to the UN, Valentyn Rybakov, said the Russian troops were in his country for joint exercises from 10 to 20 February “to develop joint measures to eradicate the threat on the borders of our allied state, including caused by the migration crisis and the need to stabilize the humanitarian situation”. The two nations’ combined forces, Rybakov said, would organize the defense of “strategically important facilities” and would “curb and ward off external active aggression”.",News/World news,Moscow warns Ukraine may ‘destroy itself’ as Russia and US clash at UN,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/russia-ukraine-united-nations-security-council
2/1/2022,"The decision to force NHS staff in England to get vaccinated against Covid-19 was always going to generate controversy, but it was also understandable. Sajid Javid’s professed motivation – to protect patients from unjabbed frontline personnel – was sincere, especially given the many thousands of people who have died after becoming infected while in hospital. The health secretary argued his case publicly and passionately, seeking to convert the many sceptics. But it was also a policy that was flawed from the start and which then encountered many obstacles along the way before meeting an increasingly inevitable demise. It will be little mourned.  For good policymaking to work, it needs the change being ushered in to have the backing of both those who will implement it and those affected by it, or at least a grudging willingness to go along with it. But while 58% of hospital bosses supported compulsion, 32% did not. The same survey by NHS Providers of 172 chiefs in 114 health service trusts did find near-unanimity on one question, though: 94% agreed that it would exacerbate already-widespread understaffing. More importantly, there was always going to be a hardcore of NHS staff who for whatever reason simply refused to set aside their own opposition to being vaccinated, even at the cost of losing their jobs. The 73,000 estimated to be in that position by the government’s own impact assessment was a big number, even in a workforce of 1.4 million people, and especially given that the health service has been hobbled for several years by almost 100,000 vacancies. The 40,000 care home staff who have quit since vaccination was made compulsory in that sector was a reminder of real-world consequences. Concerns about the policy took a while to emerge but then piled up quickly. Medical royal colleges representing nurses, midwives, GPs and obstetricians and gynaecologists voiced anxiety about the potential loss of staff in their areas of care; the Royal College of Nursing called the policy “self-sabotage”. An intensive care doctor challenged Javid about the edict with Sky News cameras rolling and other staff began legal action to try to overturn it. And, crucially, as the Guardian recently revealed, civil servants at his own department told Javid privately that fast-waning immunity from having two Covid jabs – NHS staff were not told they had to have a booster too – meant the policy was no longer “rational” or “proportional”. Confirming the late, late U-turn to MPs on Monday evening, Javid insisted that mandatory vaccination was the “right policy at the right time”, given it was conceived last year, when Delta was the dominant variant of coronavirus. However, high take-up of Covid boosters and fact that the recent Omicron strain is much less severe meant “it is only right but responsible that we revisit the balance of risks and opportunities that guided our original decision last year.” As a result, he said, “I believe it is no longer proportionate to require vaccination as a condition of deployment in health and all social care settings.” Javid’s backtracking will help hospitals maintain normal care. But it will also come at a price. A senior executive in a trust where 15% of staff were vaccine refuseniks said: “Undoubtedly it will help protect services by avoiding a significant loss of unjabbed staff. But there’s a balance between having staff in post to care for patients and having unjabbed staff in post treating vulnerable patients who are mostly frail, elderly and with compromised health.” The vaccination drive for the population as a whole that Boris Johnson trumpets as one of his key successes could also become another unintended casualty. As another senior NHS executive said: “It potentially undermines the public messaging around the importance of people getting vaccinated. There are still lots of people who haven’t been jabbed at all or who haven’t had their booster. This change will only make our efforts to get the final few million vaccinated harder.”",News/Society,Why demise of vaccine mandate plan for NHS staff was inevitable |  analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/why-demise-of-vaccine-mandate-plan-for-nhs-staff-was-inevitable
