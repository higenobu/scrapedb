12/22/2021,"Ihave been working from home since 2011, long before the pandemic, and getting enough exercise without a daily commute to the office has proven a challenge. I exercise most effectively when it’s just built into my day, like cycling to work was previously. My home office is also my person-cave and it is rigged out with a small couch and a TV. At some stage I independently discovered the concept of “temptation bundling” before it became a thing. At night I was binging TV shows while doing what I called the Batman Workout – situps, pushups and pull-ups, which was all Christian Bale’s Dark Knight ever seemed to need. By the time all six seasons of The Sopranos were finished, I actually was on my way to getting slightly ripped. But then I must have hurt my back, run out of good TV shows, or got the shits with it or something because I stopped.  I necessarily digress here. I’m a tinkerer and a nerd and some years ago I started pulling apart exercise treadmills that had been abandoned on the side of the road and turning the parts inside into other things. My first effort was converting my old-tech metalwork lathe to variable speed – its name is Frankenlathe. The second effort was a benchtop drill press – its name is just Drill Press. Meanwhile, to address my lingering home office fitness and ergonomic concerns, my carpenter father-in-law knocked up for me a very simple sit-stand computer workstation – basically some lengths of timber screwed to my workshop bench that cantilever out to support a keyboard/mouse work surface. I bought a gas-lift drafting chair so I would be sitting at the right height, and an elevating arm for my computer monitor. When wanting to stand, I could push the chair aside and raise the monitor up – the keyboard and mouse stayed at the same level. Just standing up at your desk does burn calories – but as a form of exercise it is dead boring, your feet get sore, your legs want to walk off somewhere else, and eventually you realise that it’s easier to think sitting down. I decided a treadmill workstation or “walking desk” would be the go. You can buy these in various forms but I decided to improvise. Your average exercise treadmill is too long for what my workspace could accommodate, but on Gumtree I found one shorter than usual and in full working order. I may have gotten it for free – it was a “need it gone” ad – though an exchange along the lines of “$10 and I’ll help you load it” comes to mind. I started stripping down the mini-treadmill, first discarding the handrails and figuring out the controls, but eventually it just languished in the Land of Unfinished Projects (garage) for several years, being variously shoved out of the way, tripped over, or having things stacked on or draped over it. Then I got interested in craft beer. Very interested. Then came the pandemic. Then between both of those combined, I was out one belt-hole in my trousers, then two, and it was time to take action. Since breaking my hand in three places when I fell headlong while trying to take adult tennis lessons(!), a Dark Knight Rises workout regime has been out of the question, at least while the hand is in rehab – a frustratingly longwinded process. So the idea of a walking desk was revived. Exercise treadmills can be raised to a vertical position so you can move them around more easily or stow them. I decided that mine would fold up in front of me when not in use, with the keyboard/mouse work surface sitting between me and the vertically stowed treadmill. The “arms” supporting my existing cantilevered desk just needed to be moved a bit further apart and screwed down again with good ol’ batten screws. The upright treadmill would then fit in between. When standing on the treadmill, both the desk surface and the monitor would need to raise up by quite a lot. So my elevating monitor stand now attaches to a Besser/cinder block, which is clamped to the workbench using a bit of hardwood cut into an L-shape and another batten screw going into the workbench. The desktop was more complicated. In the raised position, it has to be elevated and forward (away from me) in relation to its lowered position, so that I can be further forward, otherwise I would shoot off the back of the treadmill mid-stride. And when swinging the treadmill up and down, the desktop surface also needs to be shifted out of the way. Those are the basics of how this pandemic project came to exist. What kills exercise for me is the knowing you are doing it, and the waiting for it to end. Walking is one of the few things that I can do adequately and indefinitely without thinking about it very much. And with a treadmill desk, I don’t need to find the time. Typing and using a mouse is a challenge when desk-walking, but you adapt, including by going into your computer settings and putting the mouse tracking on low, and sort of bracing your wrists on the desk surface to steady your hands as you type. The Dirty Secret here is that my home office/bunker/person-cave is air conditioned. I despise the heat of summer, but now I can walk my daily five kilometres or so without becoming sweaty and angry like I would outside. The air conditioner is a repurposed one of those box-type ones that you see hanging out the wall of a cheap motel room. I put a second, outward-swinging door on my office, cut a rectangular hole and hung the air conditioner in that hole, so when I need it, I can just swing the door shut and plug it in. But that’s another story …",Opinion/Opinion,Why did I build a walking desk?

12/22/2021,"The Melbourne Cricket Club will implement Covid-19 protocols to welcome fans to the MCG for the Boxing Day Test but the ground’s capacity will not be limited, despite the Omicron variant increasing cases of the virus across Victoria’s capital. The state’s acting premier James Merlino confirmed on Tuesday that a capacity crowd of over 90,000 people would be allowed to attend the match, although MCC CEO Stuart Fox said on Wednesday he anticipated a figure closer to 70,000 based on ticket sales so far.  “We’ve got the stadium prepped, a lot of protocols in place for Boxing Day, and we can’t wait to welcome fans back to cricket,” Fox said. “Huge build-up, we’re just keen to get going.” Protocols at the ground will include checks for vaccination certificates at the gate, QR codes on entry and at some restaurants in the Members Reserve, cashless systems at bars and restaurants, and no entry for children under 12 unless accompanied by a vaccinated adult. The measures are less strict than those mid-year during the football season, but authorities are waiting for news from an emergency national cabinet meeting on Wednesday that may introduce a mask mandate across the country. In the absence of that, aside from some indoor parts of the ground, Fox couched mask-wearing in the language of personal responsibility. “We’re all used to wearing masks, and we’d encourage everyone to bring a mask at this point in time, and when you’re in congested areas we’d encourage you to wear it,” he said. Yarra Park around the MCG will be used to space out people queuing for entry, who are advised to come earlier than usual given the slower process at the gates. Professor Nancy Baxter, head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, told the Guardian that it would be safest not to have the event, but that balance was required given the way the virus has derailed so many important parts of people’s lives. “If they’re going ahead then masks should be used,” Baxter said. “No one is personally responsible for a pandemic. [Prime Minister] Scott Morrison used the analogy of skin cancer. My use of sunscreen doesn’t affect your risk of skin cancer. My wearing a mask affects your chances of contracting Covid. “It’s a long day, people will eat and drink, which means that even people who are wearing masks will take them off. People will be shouting, people will be breathing each other’s air. If it’s important for people in Melbourne, if we want a safe event that everyone can enjoy – we probably shouldn’t be having the event, but we for sure should be wearing masks.” With Melbourne back above 1,500 cases recorded per day, it seems almost inevitable that there will be exposures recorded at the Test match over the five days. That will also influence some people to stay away. “There’s always risk, but we’ve got a Covid safe plan in place for a reason,” said Fox. “We had one significant issue this year at the football, and we’ve managed that quite well. We had the data through to Health within two or three minutes. We’ve got a good handle on it, and we’re confident that we’ll get through our five days. “I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t a concern [but] people who’ve bought tickets will want to come to this event.” After Melbourne the series moves onto Sydney for the new year’s Test, starting on 5 January. Any mask mandate imposed on large-scale sporting events by national cabinet would be nation-wide and as such also impact the penultimate match of the series at the SCG.",Sport/Sport,Cricket fans urged to wear masks amid concern over risk posed by Boxing Day Test ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/22/boxing-day-ashes-test-cricket-covid-concern-masks-protocols
12/22/2021,"Much of the pandemic modelling to make news headlines since Covid-19 hit has depicted concerning scenarios involving high case numbers and hospitalisations. On Thursday, modelling from the University of NSW and cited by NSW health minister Brad Hazzard found Covid-19 cases in the state could reach 25,000 a day by the end of January. The latest modelling to raise alarm bells came from the Doherty Institute and was leaked to the media on Tuesday after being sent to politicians ahead of a meeting of national cabinet on Wednesday. It said Australia could see 200,000 new Covid cases a day by late January or early February.  Early into the pandemic in 2020, other models predicted “hundreds of thousands” of Australian deaths, while health workers in NSW were told to prepare for 8,000 deaths in the first-wave. But these are worst-case scenario models and are just one scenario out of dozens of different scenarios that are calculated by epidemiologists and biostatisticians. What is often lost in the reporting of these worst-case models is that they rarely ever eventuate, but are calculated to allow governments to see what might happen if they did nothing at all to control an outbreak, and to plan accordingly. The leaked Doherty Institute modelling projecting 200,000 cases came with an important caveat; this would only eventuate if nothing was done, including if people did not change their behaviour at all of their own accords. It also assumed no change to the pace of booster roll-outs, and that only very basic restrictions such as requiring masks in hospitals are maintained. But already, people are changing their behaviour in states like NSW where mask mandates for retail don’t exist, wearing masks anyway to shopping centres, or cancelling bookings for crowded venues. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation [Atagi] is constantly reviewing data on boosters, and adjusting its recommendations accordingly. What doesn’t make headlines are the other less worrying scenarios depicted by the Doherty Institute and other institutions that project what may happen if, for example, masks are worn, vaccines prove to offer fair protection against variants, or data changes on the reproduction rate of the virus. There is no one model or scenario experts rely upon, and models are constantly tweaked as more information is gathered about the virus. Ahead of national cabinet meeting on Wednesday the chair of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, Prof. Paul Kelly, said of the 200,000 figure “presents one of the worst case of all potential scenarios including assumptions that the Omicron variant is as severe as the Delta variant, an absence of hospital surge capacity, a highly limited booster program, no change to baseline public health and social measures and an absence of spontaneous behaviour change in the face of rising case numbers”. “None of these five assumptions represent the likely state of events, let alone all of them together, therefore presenting that scenario as the likely scenario that will occur is highly misleading.” The problem is that when parts of reports leak ahead of time, the most concerning picture, rather than the full story, is often presented. Chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, Prof. Adrian Esterman, said epidemiologists now model by creating individuals with certain ages, occupations, social movements, and other characteristics. It’s known as agent-based modelling, and it is used by the Doherty Institute. “They then do this a million times, each person with slightly different characteristics, then they simulate what happens when all of these individuals interact,” Esterman said. “To do that, they not only have to enter all these details about each individual person, they have to add in the things like the generation interval of the virus, its incubation period, its effective reproduction number as well. “And the point is, every single one of those things is an estimate, and is subject to change. So we now have dozens and dozens of parameters in the model, each of which are estimates creating ‘what if’ scenarios. “Taken together, these different scenarios help governments aim for the best, but plan for the worst. But they are only estimates, never certainties.”",News/World news,Leaked Doherty Covid modelling shows just the most worrying scenario – not the most likely | Melissa Davey,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/leaked-covid-modelling-shows-just-the-most-worrying-scenario-not-the-most-likely
12/22/2021,"Olympic and Paralympic sports will benefit from an unprecedented quarter-of-a-billion-dollar windfall in the buildup to the 2024 Paris Games after the Australian Institute of Sport and the federal government revealed a new long-term funding model for elite sport. The AIS announced on Wednesday it will, through government support, commit $257m over the next three years in an attempt to capitalise on Australia’s successful campaign in Tokyo earlier this year. It is the first time funds have been allocated for a full Games cycle, removing the uncertainty sports had previously faced on 12-month plans.  The new model is not based on rewarding success from the Tokyo Games, the AIS CEO, Peter Conde, said, but rather a commitment to build towards Paris and beyond – with a home Games looming in Brisbane in 2032. Several sports stand to benefit from cash increases, notably women’s football and the Matildas, who will receive just over $1.9m over the next three years dedicated specifically to the football tournament in Paris, after Sam Kerr’s team fell just short of winning a medal in Tokyo. Canoeing, women’s rugby sevens, rowing, surfing and skateboarding are among the other sports also set for sizeable increases. The women’s sevens program will jump 39% to an annual total of $2.5m, while surfing will get a 30% increase to $2m a year. Para and able-bodied canoeing increases to $7.15m a year, while rowing will get $10.055m. “This funding commitment is made possible because of the belief and confidence the Australian government and the AIS has in Australian sport,” Conde said. “The Tokyo Olympic Games and Paralympic Games inspired us all and we have worked with government to secure longer-term funding to forward plan and continue building on that success. This is why we are now launching an even stronger platform for Paris. “This additional high performance funding for the 2024 Games is in addition to $14.6m a year in direct athlete grants being provided leading into Paris, as well as the $82.2m allocated in the 2021 federal budget to fund wellbeing programs and extend performance pathways to develop our champions of the future. “This overall commitment to high-performance sport furthers the aim of the National High Performance Sport Strategy to create conditions for sustainable success, not only for Paris, but Los Angeles 2028 and our home Games in Brisbane in 2032.” The new funding is in addition to existing direct athlete grants ($14.6m) and the government’s $82.2m wellbeing and future athlete package, which has already led to increased investment in sports including softball, baseball, gymnastics, women’s hockey, men’s football and rugby sevens. “Through this commitment by the federal government and via a collaborative process with the AIS, sports are enabled to build their plans in advance for a full summer Games cycle, with funding right through until the end of 2024,” the minister for sport, Richard Colbeck, said. “This will be the first time that sports have received funding certainty so far out from an Olympic and Paralympic Games, and we’re proud to have made that commitment to building sustainable success for our high-performance athletes and their support teams.”",Sport/Sport,Australia’s Olympic and Paralympic sports to receive $275m funding boost,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/22/australias-olympic-and-paralympic-sports-to-receive-275m-funding-boost
