4/9/2022,"A newlywed Virginia Beach couple was found gunned down in their apartment—and police are now searching for the missing brother of one of the victims. Talon Rodgers and Alisa Wash, both 23, were discovered dead in their apartment Monday night around 6:30 p.m. by Virginia Beach Police officers in what is being described as a “double homicide,” according to a statement from police. Police said the incident does not appear to be “domestic related” at this time. Just two days after discovering the bodies, police issued a missing persons alert for Collin Q. Rodgers, who they described as an “endangered adult.” Although authorities did not describe Collin’s connection to Talon, a family friend identified him to The Virginian-Pilot as Talon’s younger brother. According to police, Collin was last seen by his parents at their Yorktown home on March 27. Detectives learned that he was missing during their investigation into the double homicide and said he is being considered “endangered” because of the “unknown circumstances” of his disappearance. A spokesman for the police department referred to the investigation as a “complex” case to WVEC-TV and said authorities are still trying to piece together what happened at the couple’s apartment, where Collin may also have been temporarily living at the time of the murders. Oxygen.com reached out to police, but did not receive an immediate response. Colin Rodgers Photo: Virginia Beach Police Department Neighbors told the news outlet that the couple had gotten married about a month before their shocking deaths. A wedding photo posted on March 12 on Wash’s Facebook page shows the couple beaming at the camera as Wash holds a white bouquet of flowers. “They were such good people,” a neighbor, who asked not to be identified, told the paper. “They were always together.” Zak Rabe, a neighbor who lived next door to the couple’s apartment, told The Virginian-Pilot that he had heard “a couple of loud bangs” one night last week while working late. “It was the middle of the night,” he said. “I had my headset on. I couldn’t really tell if it was close or far away.” Another neighbor—who described Wash as a “ray of sunshine”—told WVEC-TV she heard loud sounds on March 30.  The couple’s bodies were discovered after their friends had been concerned that they hadn’t heard from them. Talon was profiled in 2020 in a Tidewater Community College publication, the TCC Today, after winning a $2,000 scholarship from the American Boat Yacht Council Foundation while pursuing an associate degree in diesel marine technology.  “Talon is meticulous in everything he does and is a standout student,” Professor Abe Arispe, who had recommended him for the honor, said at the time. “He’s not afraid to ask questions and wants to be sure he has each task down pat.”  Talon said he was drawn to the diesel marine program because he wanted to expand on the knowledge that he already had from fixing up cars alongside his father while growing up. When he wasn’t in the classroom, Talon said he enjoyed riding his motorcycle through the country.  “It’s something you can do alone and get some air,” he said.  The couple had both been part of motorcycle social clubs before their deaths. Anyone with information about the homicides is asked to contact authorities.  Collin has been described as having several distinctive tattoos, including a snake on his arm and a blue Pokémon on his collar bone. Police said he may be driving a silver Hyundai Tiburon with the Virginia license plate: 4871XH.
