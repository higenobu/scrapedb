1/20/2022,"Former President Donald Trump should be investigated under the “closest possible microscope” for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his involvement in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, conservative attorney George Conway told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes on Tuesday. “This is gravest crime you could imagine that a president could commit. If you don’t at least look at this with the closet possible microscope, you are basically saying that a president is completely above the law,” said Conway, a vocal Trump critic who is married to former Trump White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. “This is about the Constitution basically being destroyed,” he added. “And if the Justice Department doesn’t use every available resource to look into whether or not that should be criminally prosecuted, it would be a travesty.” .@gtconway3d on why Trump must have his day in court for 1/6:“This is gravest crime you could imagine that a president could commit.

Did he do it corruptly? Well, let us count the ways.” “He lied his ass off for two months about the election. That seems pretty corrupt. He tried to coerce his vice president ... that seems pretty corrupt,” Conway continued. “And given the fact that what he was trying to do here — whether he was doing it corruptly or not, or with the intent to incite violence or not — he was trying to end constitutional democracy in the United States, which he was sworn to preserve, protect and defend. There isn’t a greater crime that could have been committed by the president of the United States.” Attorney General Merrick Garland said earlier this month that the Justice Department would do everything in its power to pursue wrongdoing “at any level” to defend democracy. “The Justice Department remains committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law — whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” he said. More than 700 people have been charged in connection with the attack on Congress, including 11 members of the right-wing Oath Keepers group who were indicted last week on seditious conspiracy charges.

1/20/2022,"Earth's interior is cooling faster than we previously estimated, according to a recent study, prompting questions about how long people can live on the planet. There's no exact timetable on the cooling process, which could eventually turn Earth solid, similar to Mars. But results from a new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, focuses on how quickly the core may cool by studying bridgmanite, a heat-conducting mineral commonly found at the boundary between the Earth's core and mantle. “Our results could give us a new perspective on the evolution of the Earth’s dynamics,"" ETH Zurich professor Motohiko Murakami, the lead author of the study, said in a press release. ""They suggest that Earth, like the other rocky planets Mercury and Mars, is cooling and becoming inactive much faster than expected."" The boundary between the Earth's outer core and mantle is where the planet's internal heat interaction exists. The scientific team studied how much bridgmanite conducts from the Earth's core and found higher heat flow is coming from the core into the mantle, dissipating the overall heat and cooling much faster than initially thought. ""This measurement system let us show that the thermal conductivity of bridgmanite is about 1.5 times higher than assumed,"" Murakami said in the press release. ""We still don't know enough about these kinds of events to pin down their timing.""

1/20/2022,"Fox News contributor Lara Trump is getting a lesson in recent history on Twitter after her latest gripe about President Joe Biden. Trump, the daughter-in-law of former President Donald Trump via her marriage to his son Eric Trump, said Biden was spending too much time in his home state of Delaware, where he goes on most weekends. “I’m old enough to remember when we had a president who worked all day everyday for the American people,” Lara Trump said on Fox News on Tuesday, adding: Lara Trump also said Donald Trump “clearly wasn’t golfing a quarter of his presidency.” But it was close: He played nearly 300 rounds over his single term in office, costing taxpayers more than $150 million. Millions of those tax dollars went into his own pocket since many of the golfing trips took place at his resorts.

1/20/2022,"As Omicron continues to spread rapidly across the country—and the world—it’s become clear that some Omicron symptoms are different from those of previous COVID-19 variants. People are reporting less loss of taste and smell and more cold-like symptoms, for starters. And there’s one symptom in particular that keeps coming up with Omicron: a headache. Early data from the U.K. published in the BMJ lists headache as one of the most common symptoms of Omicron, along with a runny nose and fatigue. Twitter is also flooded with anecdotal reports of headaches tied to Omicron. Data from the Washington State Department of Health released last week show just how common a headache is with Omicron: A whopping 65% of patients reported having one, making it the most common symptom the health department detected in people with the variant. Of course, headaches are common and can be caused by a slew of different things. So, what should you do if you develop a headache right now? Doctors break it down. It’s important to note that a headache isn’t a new symptom of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cites headache as one of the most common COVID-19 symptoms in a list that hasn’t been updated since February 2021. Other symptoms include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea That said, many are pointing out that a headache seems to be more common with Omicron than it was with Delta and other variants, and the data seem to back that up. But…why? “Many respiratory viruses—including COVID—cause headaches,” says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Doctors say there can be a few reasons why this happens with Omicron. “The general thought is that your body is experiencing an inflammatory reaction as it fights off the virus,” says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “A headache, along with fatigue, fever, and other signs are all part of that inflammatory symptom complex.” But Omicron in particular seems to focus more on the upper respiratory tract, which includes your sinuses, says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. “A headache commonly occurs with inflammation of the sinuses,” he points out. Add in other factors like the stress of having COVID-19, and Dr. Russo says it’s “highly plausible” that people infected with Omicron would develop a headache. There’s also this to consider, too, per Dr. Adalja: Symptoms of Omicron are more mild in general than previous variants—especially in people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19—and that may make symptoms like a headache more noticeable than it was with previous variants. “Headache” is a pretty broad term that can range from having a minor twinge to a full-blown migraine. But Dr. Schaffner says that an Omicron headache is “more likely to be frontal,” meaning you’ll probably feel it in your forehead vs. the back of your head. “You may also tap over your sinuses in your forehead and cheekbone and have pain,” Dr. Russo says. If you happen to get a headache right now, Dr. Adalja says you shouldn’t jump to conclusions. “An isolated headache is not something that I would attribute to COVID-19 because there are many, many causes of headaches,” he says. But, if you develop a headache along with other COVID-19 symptoms, Dr. Schaffner says it’s time to take a test. You also might want to consider getting tested if you develop a headache and you’ve had a recent known exposure to COVID-19, Dr. Russo says. “If you’re in a household where most people are positive, for example, it may be a harbinger of things to come,” he adds. The best way to treat a headache due to Omicron is the same way you’d treat a headache in most other situations, Dr. Schaffner says. He recommends taking acetaminophen to reduce your pain and making sure you continue to drink plenty of fluids (dehydration can make your headache worse). “If that doesn’t work, up your game to NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen,” Dr. Russo says. (These medications help block pain and reduce inflammation in a different way from acetaminophen.) And, if your headache seems to be related to inflammation in your sinuses, Dr. Russo suggests taking a decongestant as well to help relieve pressure in the area. Again, though, if you happen to develop a headache but have no other symptoms of COVID-19, you shouldn’t panic and assume you have the virus. “It could be from anything,” Dr. Schaffner says.

Logan Smith, 18, of Cocoa allegedly attacked the jogger Monday, but his plans were thwarted when the victim overpowered him using martial arts. Smith was reportedly detained until deputies arrived at the scene, according to an arrest report obtained by FOX 35 Orlando. MAN WANTED IN FLORIDA MURDER ARRESTED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

Investigators said Smith had a rubber mallet, an aerosol can of Axe body spray, a belt from a robe and a sheet laid out in the driveway of his residence to assist in his plot. ""The defendant walked directly across his street where he hid behind a light pole. He placed the mallet and the Axe aerosol on the ground next to him while he waited for the [victim] to come running down the street as he did regularly for exercise,"" the arrest affidavit states. Smith then allegedly tossed the robe belt over the victim's head until it was around the front area of the victim's neck. The victim immediately realized what was happening, and used his martial arts training to turn the tables on his attacker.

1/20/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Wednesday condemned plans by Slovenia to upgrade relations with self-governing Taiwan, a move likely to spark diplomatic and economic retaliation against the tiny Central European country. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China was “shocked by this and strongly opposed to it,” but gave no immediate details on how Beijing would respond. “It is a dangerous statement made by the Slovenian leader that overtly challenges the one-China principle and supports Taiwan independence,"" Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing, referring to comments Monday by Slovenia’s Prime Minister Janez Jansa. China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary and has been ratcheting up diplomatic pressure on the island to force it into political concessions. “No one should underestimate the strong determination, firm will and strong ability of the Chinese people to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Zhao said. Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949, and the People's Republic insists it is the sole legal representative of the island despite never having governed it. Slovenia follows Lithuania’s move allowing Taiwan to open a representative office in its capital under the name “Taiwan,” rather than “Chinese Taipei” in a break with diplomatic convention. American and Lithuanian officials say China has blocked imports from the northern European country since the Taiwanese government was allowed to open a trade office there under the name Taiwan. The U.S. and most other governments, including Lithuania, have diplomatic relations only with Beijing but maintain commercial and informal political ties with Taiwan’s democratically elected government. Most governments acquiesce to Chinese pressure by requiring Taiwanese entities to operate under the name Chinese Taipei. Chinese pressure has reduced the number of Taiwan's formal diplomatic allies to just 14. Beijing retaliated for Lithuania’s move by expelling the Lithuanian ambassador, and Lithuania has since closed its embassy in Beijing. Taiwan responded by setting up a $1 billion credit program aimed at funding projects by Lithuanian and Taiwanese companies, as well as creating a $200 million investment fund to help the Lithuanian economy. Both Lithuania and Slovenia are members of the European Union, which has taken an increasingly forceful stance against aggressive political and economic moves by Beijing. Both are also members of NATO and plan to set up their own representative offices in Taiwan, a close U.S. ally. In his comments, Jansa said ties with Taiwan would not include an exchange of ambassadors but would be at the same level as many of EU nations maintain with the island. Referring to Lithuania, he said it was “terrifying"" how China was attempting to isolate small European nations, saying that would harm Beijing's interests in the long term. In Taipei, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou on Tuesday praised Jansa as a “friend of Taiwan for many years"" who has visited on multiple occasions. “We would like to make a positive response to the establishment of representative offices, express a high degree of welcome and our sincere thanks,” Ou told reporters.",World/Associated Press,China condemns plans by Slovenia to upgrade Taiwan ties,https://news.yahoo.com/china-condemns-plans-slovenia-upgrade-093235193.html
