5/15/2022,"They have called it “Gota Go Village”. Here, on what was once an empty stretch of lawn outside the office of the Sri Lankan prime minister, on Colombo’s seafront Galle Face promenade, a thriving community has sprung up. There are tents, food stalls, a library, a memorial, art installations, stages for music and speeches, and even the beginnings of a small farm growing vegetables and fruit from recently planted trees. Nearby, a patch has been set aside to cultivate rice. It began as the focal point of the anti-government protests that have engulfed Sri Lanka for months as the country goes through the worst economic crisis since independence. As fuel, food and medicine have run short, the blame has been placed firmly at the feet of one man, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, widely known as Gota, who stands accused of economic mismanagement and corruption pushing the country to the brink of bankruptcy. The calls from the majority of the population have been clear: Gota must step down. But as it has become evident that Gotabaya Rajapaksa will not give in to public demands, the protesters, too, have made it clear they are not going anywhere. What began as a few temporary marquees grew into a full tent village occupied by hundreds. “We will not stop the protest until Gota goes home. We are staying here and we are ready to stay permanently,” said AM Fernando, who works in the television and film industry. But last week, the protest village also became the target of the worst violence the country has seen since the demonstrations began earlier this year. On Monday, pro-government supporters, many of whom had been bussed in from outside the city, attacked the Gota Go Village site. Armed with iron rods and sticks, they beat protesters and set tents alight. Police then fired tear gas and water cannons at the camp. Among the injured was a Buddhist monk, Welimada Upananda Thero, who is now receiving treatment for a leg so badly bruised that he needs crutches. “They just came started beating us. They beat everything we had in our tent, even my sandals,” he said The incident triggered violence elsewhere. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the brother of the president, who resigned as prime minister on Monday after mounting public pressure, had to be evacuated at dawn on Tuesday from his official residence in Colombo after protesters tried to storm the building. Houses belonging to the Rajapaksas and their supporters were attacked and set alight across the country, and the military was brought on to Colombo’s streets with orders to shoot looters. Yet despite a curfew and the imposition of a state of emergency, protesters at Gota Go Village turned out in their droves, rebuilding structures pulled down by the pro-government attacks. Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s appointment on Thursday of a new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has served as PM five times before, did little to appease the anger of many at the camp, and a spinoff site, “Ranil Go Home”, was set up by Friday. Wickremesinghe, who has been in politics for more than four decades, last served as PM between 2015 and 2019 in a regime that toppled the Rajapaksa family’s previous decade-long hold on power but ultimately descended into dysfunction and infighting. He suffered a humiliating defeat in the 2020 parliamentary election, with his United National Party (UNP) winning just a single seat. While he is regarded as a safe pair of hands for the economy, Wickremesinghe is also seen by many as the quintessential insider politician who will continue the status quo. He is long accused of protecting the interests of both the Rajapaksa family and corrupt figures in his own earlier government, maintaining his political career through back-door scheming. “The real problem for Ranil is he is being seen as prop, albeit a very weak one, for a widely discredited and now even reviled leader,” said Harim Peiris, a political analyst. Wickremesinghe said he was taking on the role in order to guide the country through the worst of the economic crisis and put food back on to people’s plates, and said he still supported the protesters’ call for Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down. But Alan Keenan, International Crisis Group senior consultant on Sri Lanka, said that by accepting the position, Wickremesinghe was inevitably helping to prop up the Rajapaksa regime. “His appointment breathes new life into the desperate Rajapaksa family, and seems likely to undercut chances of achieving the protesters’ central demand – backed by 90% of the public – that Gotabaya Rajapaksa resign as president.” Asanka Abeyrathna, a former university lecturer who has been at the protest camp since it was set up, was among those who said they were not happy with the decision to appoint Wickremesinghe as prime minister. “In 2015, Ranil was in charge of a government that promised us justice – but this did not happen, so what is the point of having Ranil again?” said Abeyrathna. “Maybe he can bring in dollars to get us gas, electricity and fuel but this will not ensure justice for past atrocities or relief for the people. Until Gota goes there will be no change.” Many in the protest camp called for Wickremesinghe to prove his political neutrality by taking action against the Rajapaksa family and to arrest Mahinda Rajapaksa for his role in instigating Monday’s violence. “The first thing Ranil has to do is to send Gota home and also punish him for the wrongs he has done,” said Fernando. Wickremesinghe’s ability to govern as prime minister remains to be seen. He is the only lawmaker from his UNP in parliament and so will be reliant on pro-Rajapaksa MPs and a few independents to form a majority coalition. He claimed to have the numbers but his majority will be put to the test in coming days, as parliament is due to vote on a motion of no confidence in the president and he will also have to get a budget passed. While Wickremesinghe’s appointment is likely to be welcomed by foreign governments and international creditors, many are sceptical he will bring about the systemic change being demanded by those on the streets or provide long-term political stability. “As long as there is a state of emergency, and the current president continues to function, the country’s economic recovery will be devastatingly slow,” said Gehan Gunatilleke, a human rights lawyer and former adviser to the Sri Lankan foreign ministry. Senior opposition lawmaker and economist Harsha de Silva publicly rejected an offer to take over the finance ministry in Wickremesinghe’s cabinet. “People are not asking for political games and deals – they want a new system that will safeguard their future,” he said.",News/World news,Sri Lankan president ‘Gota’ clings on to power despite violent protests and new PM,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/sri-lankan-president-gota-clings-on-to-power-gotabaya-rajapaksa
5/15/2022,"Irecently read (and greatly enjoyed) V2, Robert Harris’s absorbing second world war thriller about British attempts to locate and destroy the base in the Netherlands from which Hitler’s “Retaliation Weapon 2” – those devastating rocket-powered bombs aimed at London – were launched. Harris is famous for the meticulous research that underpins his plots and V2 is no exception. For me, a particularly interesting aspect of the novel was his portrayal of Wernher von Braun, the German aerospace engineer who was the leading figure in the development of Nazi rocketry and who was snaffled by the US (with a large number of his technical associates) to enjoy a splendid second career as the mastermind of the US space programme. Harris portrays Von Braun as an exceedingly shrewd operator who effectively used the Nazi regime to enable him to further his dream of space exploration. Although he joined the National Socialist party in 1937, he claimed that doing so was the only way of being allowed to continue his technical work on rocketry, which is perhaps plausible. Less so perhaps was his decision to join the SS, a decision that plays a useful role in Harris’s story. At one point, though, he came under suspicion for bring insufficiently “patriotic” and spent two weeks in a Gestapo cell before being reinstated after intervention by Albert Speer, the minister for war production, on the grounds that he was essential to the V2 programme. Whatever the truth is about this, what is abundantly clear is that Von Braun was an astute manipulator of the Nazi regime for his own purposes. He also knew that when Germany eventually surrendered, the Americans would be more interested in his potential usefulness than in, say, the employment of slave labour in the German rocket programme. And so it proved. In June 1945, the state department approved the transfer of Von Braun and his specialist team to the US. He worked on the US army’s ballistic missile programme and designed the rocket that launched the US’s first space satellite in 1958, four months after the USSR’s Sputnik sent the American political class into a panicky tailspin. In 1960, his group was assimilated into Nasa, where he became director of the new Marshall Space Flight Center and the lead architect of the Saturn V rocket that propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the moon. Not bad for a former SS officer, eh? But, as I discovered as I burrowed down the agreeable rabbit hole on which Harris had launched me, the story gets better. During his early years in the US, Von Braun became pally with Walt Disney, with whom he collaborated on a series of three educational films and to whom he probably confided his dream of a manned mission to Mars. More intriguingly, in 1949, when he was stationed at Fort Bliss in Texas, he wrote a science fiction novel (in German) entitled Marsprojekt but failed to find a publisher for it. He wrote it, he writes in the preface, “to stimulate interest in space travel”. Eventually, the novel was translated into English, cleared by the Pentagon (on the grounds that its author’s visions of space travel were “too futuristic to infringe on classified matters”) and published in 2006 as Project Mars: A Technical Tale. The action is set in 1980 – three decades after its composition. The world is governed by the United States of Earth, established after a devastating war in the 1970s between the western powers and the eastern bloc. The west won the conflict with the aid of Lunetta, an orbiting space station that dropped nuclear missiles on the Soviet Union. Soon after “peace” returns to the world, astronomers discover canals on Mars, suggesting the presence of intelligent life there. The president orders a mission to Mars to establish just how intelligent the Martians are and whether they pose a threat to Earth. Project Mars is very much the work of an engineer, outlining – in 48 chapters – the technical requirements of a huge space expedition involving a flotilla of 10 spacecraft with 70 crew members that would return after spending 443 days on Mars before the trip back to Earth. Chapter 24 is particularly interesting because it relates what the explorers discover about the planet’s inhabitants, who are conveniently humanoid in appearance and wisely live underground. They welcome the visitors, to whom they appear to be members of an ancient and benevolent “super-civilisation”. Martian technology is far superior to that of the vacationing Earthlings: it includes underground transport and organ transplants, for example; Martians take ethics and morality seriously and they believe that technology should be used responsibly. But the real knockout, at least for this columnist, is Von Braun’s account of how these super-humanoids are governed. It is all done by a group of 10 “men” under an ultra-wise leader. And what do they call this super-sage? Why, “the Elon”. Remind you of anyone? Keep on truckin’Cars Are Here to Stay is the title of a sobering essay by Alex Trembath.

Ye Vagabonds – brothers Diarmuid and Brían Mac Gloinn – boast a peer group that includes Lankum, Lisa O’Neill and Brigid Mae Power, all of whom are refurbishing tradition in deft, inspired ways. Here, the Carlow-born, Dublin-based Mac Gloinns set aside the Irish songs of The Hare’s Lament – their first album for Rough Trade offshoot River Lea, a label becoming a Hibernian force – in favour of traditional and original pieces sung in English.

Sibling harmonies are at the heart of the Vagabonds’ sound, delivered softly and unfussily, but the brothers are adept guitarists, and augment their arrangements with cello and bass from classical group Crash Ensemble, and with harmonium concertina and sax.

5/15/2022,"EasyJet removing seats from its planes, Tui no longer serving meals on flights, and bus companies cutting services. From the headlines, Britain appears to have a big problem with sickness absence as Covid adds to staff shortages across the economy. But these incidents apart, the big picture is very different. Thanks to low sick pay – now back to pre-Covid levels despite Boris Johnson’s promise to “build back better” from the health emergency – Britain has among the fewest working days lost to illness in the developed world. Sickness absence rose last year as the economy reopened, from a record low in 2020 when the pandemic reduced socialising and people could keep logging on from home despite illness. However, despite rising from 3.6 to 4.6 days a year, the average number of days lost to sickness has been falling steadily – from seven a year in the mid-1990s. Even with Covid and a bigger workforce, almost 36m fewer working days were lost in 2021 compared with 1995, a decline of a fifth to 149.3m. Critics say the government skipped a golden opportunity in the Queen’s speech last week to boost workers’ rights, and that Johnson’s party is out of ideas for fixing the cost-of-living crisis. After his election landslide in 2019, he promised an employment bill, yet, to the dismay of unions and employers’ groups, failed to take action last week. “If the period after a pandemic, where the inadequacy of the system has been thrown into sharp relief, isn’t the right time, when is?” said Rachel Suff, policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). A survey of 6,000 workers by the trade body for HR professionals found that over the past three months, almost half of employees went to work despite not feeling well enough to fulfil their duties. The CIPD says fixing sick pay should be a top priority for workers and employers alike. Suff said: “The absence figures mask the true picture for the health of the working-age population.” Britain’s sickness absence rates are less than half the European average, and closer to those in developing nations such as Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Employment experts say the reason is sick pay, where the UK is also the bottom of global league tables. Statutory sick pay (SSP) is £99.35 a week, paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. Early in the Covid pandemic the government began to pay this from day one of sickness, but in February it switched back to being paid from day four. This is one of the lowest rates in the OECD group of rich economies. As little as 19% of the average UK salary is covered by sick pay, according to the TUC. Rates are higher in Spain (42%), Sweden (64%) and Belgium (93%), while support is worse only in South Korea and the US, where workers have no legal right to sick pay. Germans on sick leave get full pay for six weeks, then 70% for up to 78 weeks. The UK government said international comparisons were difficult to make because of differences in each country’s system, and said it had improved the process in Britain with legally valid digital “fit notes” replacing handwritten ones: “As we learn to live with Covid-19,” it said, “we are keeping the SSP system under review.” Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Manchester Business School, said inadequate sick pay and a precarious economic backdrop were forcing people to keep working even when ill: “From Thatcher on, we have Americanised the UK economy, making it less secure and offering less protection than other countries.” The leading American-born psychologist, who coined the term “presenteeism” in the 1980s to describe the need to be at work even when not fully functioning, said an inadequate safety net was shortsighted and bad for productivity. “My view is the more you treat people properly, value and trust them, protect them and provide them with some security – not 100% but some – the more you’ll get out of them.” Experts warn that there are gaping holes in the system. Neither Britain’s 4 million self-employed workers nor employees earning less than £123 a week are entitled to SSP. As many as 2 million fall into the latter category, 70% of them women. Some employers do offer occupational sick pay schemes, but the prevalence of these has fallen dramatically since SSP was introduced under the first Thatcher government. In the early 1980s, 90% of employers offered this benefit, but after decades of decline, the Department for Work and Pensions estimated in 2014, the latest available data, that 26% of workers relied on SSP alone, while 17% didn’t know what they were entitled to. Occupational schemes are concentrated in higher-paying sectors, leaving factory and retail workers, and carers – among those least likely to be eligible for SSP in the first place – to the mercy of inadequate state support. With higher-paid service sector workers continuing to work at least partly from home – a factor that drove down sickness absence in 2020 – critics warn that a two-tier outlook for good health at work is emerging. “This is a class issue,” says Kate Bell, head of economics and rights at the TUC. In real terms, the rate of SSP is lower today than when it was launched in 1982. Unions and business groups say it needs to be brought closer to the real living wage of £9.90 an hour and £11.05 in London – the equivalent of £361.35 and £403.33 for an average working week. “No one should have to choose between putting food on the table or doing the right thing and staying at home when sick, but that is exactly what millions of workers up and down the country face,” Bell said. “Time and time again we warned ministers that sick pay wasn’t enough to live on. It’s reckless and counterproductive for ministers not to have fixed our broken sick pay system. Enough is enough.”",News/Business,Why the UK’s dire rates of sick pay bode ill for the economy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/14/uk-dire-rates-of-sick-pay-bad-for-the-economy-absenteeism
5/15/2022,"In the crypt of a 283-year-old London church, you would not normally expect to see displays of fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and fish next to shelves of tinned food, toilet rolls and nappies, and customers with baskets doing their weekly shop. But from September, that will be the scene at the City of London’s first social supermarket, which is to open in the vaults of Christ Church Spitalfields, a Nicholas Hawksmoor-designed church close to the financial district. It will replace a food bank set up during the pandemic that has been used by 20 to 70 families a week during the past year. Small social supermarkets have been springing up across the UK in recent years, some of them having started out as food banks. (At a social supermarket users pay for their groceries, but get a large discount.) They cater for low-income families – in the case of Christ Church these are referred by the local primary school – and pay a membership fee and/or a weekly fee for their shop. The vast majority of the families who use the Christ Church food bank include one or two adults who are working. Natasha Grimmett, head of social transformation at the church, said: “With the energy crisis and the rising cost of living, it’s hard when two parents are working and still they’re not able to meet basic necessities. It’s a misconception that people using food banks are unemployed.” Rather than picking up a free package of food and other staples, families using the new social supermarket will be able to choose from dozens of products. For a membership fee of £15 or £20 a year, they can do their weekly shop each Thursday for a fee of £3. The Pepys social supermarket in Lewisham, south London, runs on similar lines: local people pay a £3.50 weekly fee for shopping that would normally cost £30. Those who cannot afford this will still get help from Christ Church. Everything in the social supermarket will be colour-coded: green is for lower-cost staples such as rice, pasta, tinned food and basic vegetables, plus toilet rolls and sanitary products; the yellow category includes milk, eggs, more premium veg, fruit and cleaning products; red is for the most expensive items – meat, fish and disposable nappies. A single working mother who has been a regular food bank user said the social supermarket was “a very good idea as it will give people the opportunity and freedom to choose what they need in their basket without feeling embarrassed”. Set up by pastor Brigid Beney in the summer of 2020 to help local families, the Christ Church food bank expanded last year thanks to funding from the UK subsidiary of Japanese telecoms firm NTT Data. This was part of an initiative called The City Gives Back, which aimed to help shop and hospitality workers in the Square Mile who were hit hard when office workers switched to working from home and the City became a ghost town. The food bank has received nearly £50,000 so far from NTT Data UK and some of its clients, including insurers Howden Group, Tokio Marine Kiln and Ascot Group, and also takes donations from local supermarkets, often of food close to its sell-by date. NTT and Ascot have committed to funding the project for another year, and Grimmett said the church had also been applying for grants. She said turning the food bank into a social supermarket would help it reach more people and offer them a wider variety of food and other essential items – as well as avoiding the stigma of a handout. It will also offer debt counselling and classes in money management, IT and English language. “People have a bit more autonomy in what they choose,” Grimmett said. “We are moving our model from a crisis response in the pandemic to addressing the chronic issues in our area, which include the cost of living.” The City of London is an area of vast social disparity. It’s where the highest earners in the country work – it had an average income of £55,200 last year, compared with £25,000 across the UK, according to HMRC. What some of the families live on for a week, some City workers easily spend on food in a day. The food bank was the idea of Kim Gray, who was head of diversity at NTT Data UK. She has now left the company but still leads the food project, in collaboration with Pete Pentecost, who at the start of the pandemic lost his job handing out the free City AM newspaper to commuters at Bank station. “Pete thinks the social supermarket is a great idea. It’s just the next evolution of the food bank,” said Gray. “The City of London has been generous during the pandemic and has made people more aware of local issues, but it’s still very tough for many.”",News/Society,Social supermarkets offer choice and self-esteem to hard-up workers,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/14/social-supermarkets-offer-choice-and-self-esteem-to-hard-up-workers
5/15/2022,"Thousands of patients have been left without vital healthcare after nearly one in 10 physiotherapists was prevented from practising after their regulator removed them from its register. Exactly 5,311 physiotherapists were deregistered by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) on 1 May because they had not renewed their registration after the HCPC decided not to send out reminder letters. Ash James, director of practice and development at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP), said its helpline had been swamped with calls from distressed physiotherapists, concerned for their patients and worried about dramatic losses in income. “In one of the trusts in Liverpool, 23 physios were sent home in one day, and obviously the implication for patients is huge,” he said. “At a time when the workforce is stretched by the Covid backlog, it’s obviously not ideal that we’ve lost 9% of the workforce overnight.” Physiotherapists have many roles but play a crucial part in helping people leave hospital after long stays, because lengthy bed rest leads to muscle wastage that leaves patients needing physiotherapy to learn to walk again. So far, only about 2,300 physios have been re-registered. With most practitioners seeing at least five patients a day, the number of cancelled NHS and private appointments in the past two weeks could range between 50,000 to 100,000. The UK’s 61,000 physiotherapists are among 15 health professions regulated by the HCPC, along with paramedics, podiatrists, radiographers and occupational therapists – known as allied health professionals. Every two years, they must fill in a renewal form showing they have continued to work on their professional development and are fit to practise. There are three months to complete the process and the date is fixed, but usually only a small number of practitioners accidentally miss the deadline. The CSP said this year’s problems were due to the HCPC decision to switch away from letters and rely on email and text message reminder. Some physiotherapists did not receive a reminder email because they had been on maternity leave without access to email. Others had changed jobs, or lost access to old email addresses. A senior NHS physiotherapist said two members of her team had been downgraded and lost 25% of their pay as a result. Another physiotherapist who had left the NHS to work privately has lost two weeks’ pay so far. She turned up at the HCPC’s headquarters in tears trying to pay for her renewal, but no one would see her. “I have had to cancel patients for two weeks,” she said. “My husband doesn’t work – I have lost two weeks’ pay. One patient had come from Germany to see me and I had to cancel.” Some of her patients are vulnerable because they have neurological problems, she added, and need help to avoid falling and injuring themselves but she was not allowed to see them. “I’ve been waking up at 3am and crying. I feel broken and helpless and sick, just because I missed an email. Even the gas company will give you three warnings. But this has cut off my livelihood,” she said. Andrew Smith, the HCPC’s executive director of regulation, said 99.6% of its emails had been delivered, although he was unable to say how many were opened. He said they sent a reminder on 12 April and a newsletter, and also sent text messages. “People forget and don’t renew and it can be very stressful for someone who didn’t renew in time,” he said, adding that they worked with the CSP to find different ways to remind people. “We never see 100% of a profession renew – people retire, take career breaks, maternity and paternity leave. The normal range is between 90% and 97%. With physios this year, it’s 91%, within the normal range.” The CSP said usually 1,000 to 1,500 people left the profession each year, which would mean a renewal rate closer to 97%. Asked if the HCPC would expect to see similar numbers of physiotherapists removed from the register in future years, or if the body is looking at reforming the process, Smith said they would “always try to look to see if we can do things better – most organisations would want to do that”. He said they used a similar renewal process to other healthcare regulators, and that it was also the responsibility of employers to ensure that their staff met regulatory requirements. The CSP’s James said: “Of course, registrants have a personal responsibility to ensure they remain on the register. But the processes from the HCPC are just poor, and I’m concerned about the urgency of their response. “It’s not acceptable from our point of view. The sole purpose of the regulator is to look after the patient. And in this instance they have failed that on a number of occasions.”",News/Society,Thousands miss out on treatment as physiotherapists are struck off UK register,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/14/thousands-miss-out-on-treatment-as-physiotherapists-are-struck-off-uk-register

James, 40, was given the honour at her family home by the Duke of Cambridge on Friday for tireless campaigning to raise awareness of bowel cancer. Since the news on Monday that she was receiving end-of-life hospice care, James has raised more than £5.7m for Cancer Research UK through her Bowelbabe fund on JustGiving. Her original target had been £250,000. She reached the £5m milestone on Friday after donations from 240,000 supporters, including William and his wife, Kate. The money will go to funding clinical trials and research into personalised medicine for cancer patients and supporting campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer. James posted pictures of William with her and her family on her Instagram and said the visit had given her family “so much to smile about in the sadness”. “I believe I may have had the most surreal, mind-blowing, humbling five days of my life. I cannot thank you for your generosity,” she wrote. She thanked the Duke of Cambridge for “going above and beyond to make a very special memory happen yesterday”, adding: “Can’t quite believe I’m actually a dame.” She said: “My family are being amazing and as emotional as it all is, we are finding so much to smile about in the sadness. I may be getting weaker and more tired … having run off pure adrenaline, but my word, I always said I wanted to slide in sideways when my time is up, with a massive smile, no regrets and a big glass of champagne! Still my intention!” In a personal tweet written by William and Kate this week they said her work to raise awareness of the illness was inspiring. James was diagnosed with bowel cancer shortly before Christmas 2016. Since then, the former secondary school deputy headteacher has gone on to present BBC Radio 5 live’s You, Me and the Big C podcast about the illness. Her book Fuck You Cancer: How to Face the Big C, Live Your Life and Still Be Yourself has become a bestseller and she has also written a column for the Sun. Her updates on social media have attracted a following of more than 680,000 people. On Monday she said her “body simply isn’t playing ball” and that she was having hospice-at-home care. “Nobody knows how long I’ve got left but I’m not able to walk, I’m sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams,” she said. When her damehood was announced on Thursday night, Boris Johnson said: “If ever an honour was richly deserved, this is it.

5/15/2022,"After a landslide election victory, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr is to become the next president of the Philippines. The son and namesake of the late dictator received more than 30m votes, beating his closest rival, the current vice-president, Leni Robredo. Here, seven people in the Philippines share their views on the result and how they feel about the future of the country. I’m utterly disappointed with how ill-informed people are and this election shows how bad democracy can be. My dad is a Marcos apologist, and I used to believe that martial law was a “golden era” because he told me so until I enrolled and graduated law school. My dad is a hardworking person and I can respect opinions, but I can’t allow historical revisionism. My father told me that I should listen to him because he thinks textbooks and education, and news and basically all forms of credible info, are all just made up by oligarchs to control the narrative and keep Filipinos poor. I voted for Leni Robredo and can’t believe how efficient she is with her time and how diligent she is in serving the people. I can’t believe the majority of Filipinos are trashing her for being too good to be true. I just hope that after this administration people will come to their senses. Lyn, 27, Baguio city – voted for Robredo The election results are appalling and are a demonstration of how history revisionism has been happening right under our noses the past few years. I honestly cannot fathom the idea of being under a Marcos administration. It is a grim time in the Philippines at the moment. I voted for Leni Robredo. My vote was informed by my confidence in her integrity, qualifications and competencies as a leader. She proved herself during her six-year term as vice-president to Duterte. She offered hope to the Filipino people that we can actually vote for someone good and just. I hope for a Philippines rid of political dynasties. I hope that the Philippines finally rejects politicians who are unqualified and stops voting for celebrities, entertainers and others who know nothing about writing bills or passing laws. We cannot be swayed by empty promises any more. I hope that every single Filipino holds the new administration accountable and is open to calling out and criticising where they fall short. Celina, 24, government worker, Metro Manila – voted for Robredo I feel ecstatic about the election results. The Marcoses built a lot of infrastructure which still exists today – infrastructure in the Philippines has been neglected for decades. Our expectation is that it will now be the focus of this new administration. I feel that the presidencies following that of Ferdinand Marcos Sr did not really bring about lasting progress. The Philippines continues to lag behind Asean [Association of South-east Asian Nations] neighbours. It is hoped that the new administration will work towards defeating the pandemic, reviving the economy and making the Philippines more competitive and investor-friendly. Mary, 48, project finance analyst, Mandaluyong city – voted for Ferdinand Marcos Jr People don’t realise that even though there was support for Leni [Robredo], there was a more powerful silent majority who supported Marcos Jr. Filipinos want a Marcos return in order to instil discipline, progress, and bring back peace and order. I voted for Pac-Man [Manny Pacquiao]. He is clean and has the heart and will to reach out to his people. He has shown true and sincere dedication in service and is known for his public service. He has also gained wisdom through his years as a congressman and senator. On top of his rigid boxing training, he is a true Cinderella man. Rene, 63, architect, Nueva Ecija – voted for Manny Pacquiao It’s a big embarrassment, for we suffered under the brutality and greed of the parents of Marcos Jr. I couldn’t in conscience vote for Marcos Jr, because I don’t believe the narrative that the reign of his father is the Philippine golden age, which it was not. I also could not vote for his opponent [Robredo] because I felt she would just be a repeat of Noynoy Aquino. So I voted for the leftist candidate Leody de Guzman as a protest vote but wish Sara Duterte ran for president instead. We have a weak political party system and I believe the problem in the Philippines is we have a defective constitution. I hope with the big mandate of the president he will initiate the rewriting of the constitution and change the current political system. Edwin, 63, retired, Pampanga, Central Luzon – voted for Leody de Guzman It’s insanity to perpetually trap ourselves in the events that transpired in 1970s and early 80s. Some of the other candidates just do not understand the ordinary Filipino psyche. I’m a Mindanaoan, [from the south of the country] and would rather have federalism than full independence. I want a country that opens our economy to the world, free and not too tied to the west or east. We want a pragmatist like Duterte is. He’s mostly misunderstood in the west – he may be crude and brash but he thinks realistically. I voted BBM/Sara and hope they will continue the current administration’s build, build, build programme and the drug war. I didn’t vote for BBM/Sara forgetting the horrors of the past. I voted because they are the only ones left who at least have the intention to build on what we already have today. AJ, 48, computer programmer, Cagayan de Oro – voted for Marcos Jr I am disgusted about the results. With EDSA – the People Power revolution – on my mind, I can still vividly recall my 10-year-old self sitting atop my papa’s shoulders chanting laban [Tagalog for fight] and flashing the L sign. In that year, 1986, I was there, a part of the people power that toppled the abusive dictatorship and witnessed right before my eyes the rebirth of democracy that started from a simple yellow ribbon. Today, 36 years after the EDSA revolution, darkness has clouded the pink ray of hope. I am dismayed and definitely not satisfied with the way the national election turned out. I am praying that every Filipino will have access to quality education, to proper healthcare, and that there will be enough nutritious food for every Filipino family’s table.

5/15/2022,"The biggest question ahead of finals day at the Italian Open is identical to the beginning of the clay-court season and it remains unanswered: who exactly can beat Iga Swiatek? So far, it is only an increasingly difficult challenge. On Saturday, Aryna Sabalenka, the third seed, stood before Swiatek and took a shot at the world No 1 in the semi-final of the Italian Open. She left with three games to her name as Swiatek methodically picked her apart, easily defeating Sabalenka 6-2, 6-1. With her 27th win in a row, Swiatek has now defeated seven top 10 players in this period and she has dropped just one set since early March. The gap between herself and the field is the size of a canyon and it is only widening. Against one of the most powerful players in the world, Swiatek was still comfortably the aggressor throughout. She continually dragged Sabalenka off the court with her heavy spin and margin, she struck her backhand extremely well and her elite defence soaked up so much of Sabalenka’s attack, constantly allowing Swiatek to counter. Swiatek additionally continues to return at a supreme level, winning an absurd 71% of first serve return points against one of the hardest first serves in the world. Despite how she has continued to bulldoze opponents, Swiatek had not been entirely content with her form, pointing out her up-and-down level in matches as she continues to adjust to the clay. In the past, when she used to be markedly better on clay, moving to her favourite surface would be a considerable relief. Now that the gap between hard and clay is much smaller, she has to adjust her relationship with the surface. “I felt a little bit differently [than in previous matches] because I think my level of focus was on a constant level throughout the whole match. Maybe in the second set I got more shaky at the end. I’m pretty happy that I learned the lessons on previous matches. On previous matches I felt like I’m kind of letting my opponents come back to the match a little bit. This time I wanted to put pressure on my opponent from the beginning till the end,” she said. The run continues. Swiatek, who defeated Karolina Pliskova 6-0, 6-0 in last year’s Rome final, will face Ons Jabeur or Daria Kasatkina there this time. As people continually speak about Swiatek’s run in awe and to express their admiration towards her, she says that she has not had time to sit back and think about her continued achievements. That will only come after they are done. “On these tournaments where we play day after day, we don’t really get time to celebrate,” she says. “Right after we finish the previous match, we have to think about the next one. It’s pretty tough. But I know that after [the tournament] I’m going to be really proud of myself. For sure I’m going to have time to think about what I did. I’m just constantly surprising myself that I can do better and better. I feel like I actually can believe now that the sky’s the limit. That’s the fun part, for sure.”",Sport/Sport,Iga Swiatek storms into Italian Open final with victory over Aryna Sabalenka,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/iga-swiatek-storms-into-italian-open-final-with-victory-over-aryna-sabalenka
