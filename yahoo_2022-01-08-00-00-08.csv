1/8/2022,"Around 100 party-goers who threw a rowdy New Year's party on a plane now can't find a flight home. Airlines are refusing to accommodate them after videos of their maskless celebration surfaced. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the party-goers ""idiots"" and said an investigation is underway. A group of passengers who partied, drank, and vaped while maskless on a Canadian charter flight are now stuck in Cancun, Mexico, after multiple airlines denied them flights home, according to the party organizer. Authorities were shocked this week by videos of the party-goers dancing in the aisle, downing vodka, and blowing e-cigarette smoke into the camera on a December 30 flight from Montreal, after the clips were revealed on Thursday by Journal de Montreal's Francis Pilon. The 100 passengers — several of whom are reality TV stars or social media influencers — became so rowdy that flight attendants tried to avoid the cabin as much as possible, Pilon reported. The event's organizer, James William Awad, said their return trip was canceled by Sunwing, the airline that flew them to Cancun. Other airlines, such as Air Canada and Air Transat, also declined to take them back to Montreal, citing safety issues for their crew and other passengers, CNN reported. Awad said in a statement on Thursday that he spoke with Sunwing, but that they ""couldn't conclude on an agreement"" because the airline wouldn't serve the passengers meals on their five-hour flight home. Sunwing listed conditions for the party-goers' return flight, requiring them to be sober while on-board, to remain seated unless using the bathroom, and to allow security staff to fly with them at Awad's expense, he said. The organizer said he agreed to these conditions, except for the lack of meals on the flight. Sunwing and Awad did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment. The trip by his organization, 111 Private Club, a self-described ""exclusive private group (by invitation only),"" was Awad's first-ever travel event, he said. According to him, everyone on the plane had been tested for COVID-19 before boarding the plane to Cancun. ""I have significantly learned, and I am still learning from this experience. Learning from them is what makes the difference,"" he said. But the party plane's blatant disregard for Montreal's pandemic rules has already summoned the fury of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who called the party-goers ""idiots"" and said the videos were ""a slap in the face,"" per The Associated Press. He pledged a full investigation into the event by Transport Canada. —Francis Pilon (@FrancisPilon_) January 6, 2022 —Francis Pilon (@FrancisPilon_) January 4, 2022 Those found in violation of the transport department's rules will face fines of up to $3,938 for every infraction, per The AP. One passenger, a real estate broker, was suspended from his job after he was filmed with a loudspeaker in his hand while partying in the skies, Pilon reported.

1/8/2022,"Last March, Andreas Flaten discovered more than 91,000 pennies in his driveway. The change was left there by a former employer mad about Flaten's accusations of wage theft. The US Department of Labor is suing the company, saying it failed to pay overtime. When Andreas Flaten didn't receive his final paycheck from a former employer last January, he complained about it, calling up the US Department of Labor to lodge an accusation of wage theft. That employer responded by leaving more than 91,000 pennies on his driveway in Fayetteville, Georgia. Now the US government is suing that company, arguing the act constituted illegal retaliation. In a complaint filed with a federal court in Georgia, the Department of Labor accuses A OK Walker Autoworks and its owner, Miles Walker, of more than just pettiness. The lawsuit claims the auto-repair shop bilked its workers out of money they were owed. The lawsuit accuses the company of ""repeatedly and willfully"" failing to pay time and a half for overtime, instead relying on a flat rate of pay regardless of whether someone worked more than 40 hours in a week. A OK Walker Autoworks did not respond to a message seeking comment. The March 2021 penny stunt — along with the complaint that preceded it — appears to have prompted investigators to take a closer look at the shop's books. ""I honestly didn't think anything would be done,"" Flaten, 27, said in a phone interview with Insider. He didn't expect much when he first argued his wages had been stolen. What's happened since has restored some of his faith in government, and he thinks it should be a lesson to other workers who find themselves in a similar position.
 ""They definitely should not be scared to reach out,"" he said. ""Speak up. Don't be quiet about it. Because if you're quiet about it, it's just going to continue to happen to you and everybody else."" The saga began in January 2021, when Flaten called the Department of Labor to say he was missing $915, per the complaint. Soon after, on January 27, 2021, a representative from the department's Wage and Hour Division called the company to find out what happened. The lawsuit says Flaten's former employers were defiant at first, saying they wouldn't give him a penny. It says that hours later, however, Walker, the owner, decided he would pay after all — one cent at a time. ""How can you make this guy realize what a disgusting example of a human being he is,"" the lawsuit quotes Walker as saying before adding: ""You know what? I've got plenty of pennies; I'll use them."" The court documents say that ""on top of the pile of pennies, Defendants left a copy of Mr. Flaten's last paycheck with an expletive written on the outside."" The only point of contention is how the pennies came to be coated in oil. The company says it did not do that; Flaten says he still has a stain in his driveway. The company dedicated a page on its website to the penny stunt, in which it pushes back against ""cancel culture"" — after the incident went viral, the company's online reviews tanked — and urges readers to ""take a stand against the tyranny of an overbearing government."" It also appears to complain about Flaten in a series of questions. Flaten said he wasn't too bothered by any of that. As with an ""angry toddler,"" he said, ""you just got to kind of ignore it.""

1/8/2022,"A Maryland couple stranded on Interstate 95 in Virginia after a winter storm slammed several Eastern states helped distribute bread from a nearby bakery truck to dozens of other stuck motorists who also had not eaten for hours.  All it took was a phone call to ask for permission. Casey Holihan and her husband, John Noe, were stopped on the interstate for hours while driving from their home to visit Noe’s family in North Carolina, according to multiple reports.   “We were tired, frustrated, and hungry. Many of the people stuck out here had small children, were elderly, had pets in the car, and hadn’t eaten in almost a whole day,” Holihan shared in a post on Facebook.  But she and Noe had an idea. At approximately 9 a.m. Tuesday, they saw a truck from Schmidt Baking Company ahead of them, according to multiple reports.  By that time, the couple had not eaten for about 37 hours.   They reached the company's customer service line and asked if they could open the truck and distribute the shipment of food it was carrying.   Holihan admitted on Facebook that “we didn’t think it would actually work” but, less than 20 minutes later, the couple “received a personal call from the owner of the company.”   .oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;} Chuck Paterakis, one of the owners of H&S Bakery, which owns Schmidt Baking Company, was on the phone. He soon directed the truck's driver, Ron Hill, to distribute bread to the stranded motorists.  “This driver Ron Hill opened the back of the truck and with the help of some people close by passed out bread to more than 50 cars who were all incredibly thankful,” Holihan shared on Facebook. “This was one of the kindest moments I have ever witnessed.” 'AN OUTRAGE': Why drivers were left stranded overnight, some for 24 hours, on I-95 in Virginia Paterakis said “it was an easy decision” to distribute the contents of the truck, which included loaves of bread and rolls, The Washington Post reported. He said the bakery was “very humbled and grateful that we could help.”   Holihan told the Post that she and her husband, Hill and others who were stuck on the interstate handed out approximately 300 packages of bread.  ""We just kept giving it out until we couldn’t walk anymore because it was so freezing,” Holihan told NBC affiliate WBAL. ""It felt incredible just hearing people say thank you and hearing people just so relieved to finally have food in their car, food in their system and in their kids’ system. It was a really incredible feeling.""  Ice and snow stranded hundreds of drivers on Interstate 95 after a winter storm hit multiple states and brought over a foot of snow to some areas. More than 300,000 people were without power in Maryland and Virginia.   USA TODAY has reached out to Holihan and H&S Bakery.   This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Maryland couple, Schmidt Baking Company feed stranded I-95 motorists",U.S./USA TODAY,A couple stuck on I-95 in Virginia saw a bakery truck and had an idea: 'We didn’t think it would actually work',https://news.yahoo.com/couple-stuck-95-virginia-saw-011331215.html
1/8/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's security strategy would be entirely undermined if NATO agreed to refrain from expanding further and curb some of its activity in Europe, as Russia has demanded, Sweden's top military commander said. The Russian demands, listed last month, have unnerved European non-NATO members including Sweden, which has strengthened ties with the alliance even if it has no plans to join at present. Sweden's government has since stepped up diplomatic activity, with Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson holding talks with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Friday. ""Thank you NATO SG @jensstoltenberg for our conversation on the importance of upholding the European security order and deepening the partnership between Sweden and NATO,"" she said on Twitter. Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde also met U.S. President Joe Biden's Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer. The meetings come as General Micael Byden told daily Dagens Nyheter in comments published on Friday: ""The proposals for a new security order would destroy the foundations of our security policy structure."" ""We aim to become a stronger defence power in all categories and develop overall defence. But that hinges on developed international cooperation,"" the commander said. NATO diplomats have said Russia cannot have a veto on further expansion of the alliance and NATO has the right to decide its own military posture. Moscow says the demands are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion. Among the demands are ruling out further NATO expansion and Ukraine's accession to the alliance and abandoning any NATO military activities in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. On Thursday, after talks with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, Andersson said Europe's security order was non-negotiable. ""In Sweden, we ourselves decide over our foreign and security policy and who we cooperate with.""

1/8/2022,"An obscure fish known as the longhead darter was found recently in the Ohio River and wildlife experts are stunned. The species was believed to have vanished from the state’s rivers and streams over 80 years ago. “Why are we so excited? ... These were the first captures in Ohio since 1939 when Milton B. Trautman captured seven in the Walhonding River,” the Ohio Division of Wildlife reported Jan. 6. “This striking creature, native to Ohio, was thought to be extirpated from the state.” The term “extirpated” means the species is believed extinct (in Ohio), but may still survive in neighboring states. No one knows for sure, because there is “little historical information” on the status of longhead darters in the country, according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. “Throughout its range, this fish is uncommon and the American Fisheries Society lists the longhead darter as threatened in all states where it occurs,” the department says. Ohio officials say two longhead darters were captured “this fall during Ohio River electrofishing bass surveys.” The division did not say what became of the two fish captured in the Ohio River. Longhead darters grow to about 4 inches and “have a series of black blotches down their side that are connected by a broad lateral stripe,” the state says. At least nine different species of fish are believed to be extirpated in Ohio, including the alligator gar, the state says. An alligator in Canada?

1/8/2022,"By Erwin Seba HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday rejected a proposal by the United Steelworkers union (USW) to end an eight-month lockout of about 600 workers at the company’s Beaumont, Texas, refinery, the company said. The union's proposed modifications to contract language do not meet the company's goals and would increase costs, Exxon said. The company told the union ""we remain far apart,"" it said on its Embeaumont.com website. The two sides met for about an hour on Thursday in their first negotiating session since late October, said Bryan Gross, USW international representative. ""We made a few modifications around holiday pay and a few other items to match other Exxon Mobil contracts at the Baytown (Texas) and Baton Rouge (Louisiana) refineries,"" Gross said. He said the proposal modifications were not concessions. The two sides are awaiting results from a U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)-supervised decertification vote on whether to remove the union from the plant. The company has said it would end the lockout when its contract proposal, rejected by the union members in October, is ratified or when the union is removed through decertification. Exxon has kept the 369,000-bpd refinery and oil-blending facility running with supervisors, managers and temporary operators. The facility produces gasoline and Mobil 1 motor oil. On Dec. 29, the NLRB said it impounded ballots in the decertification vote while it investigates the union's complaints of unfair labor practices against Exxon. Results may not be known for several weeks, a NLRB spokeswoman said. The federal board is reviewing union charges that the months-long lockout was intended to break the union at the plant and that Exxon improperly aided a union-removal campaign. Exxon has denied the allegations. USW 13-243 officials have said Exxon’s offer would eliminate job security for many of its members, while the company has said the changes are needed to operate profitably in low-margin environments.
