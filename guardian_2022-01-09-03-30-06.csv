1/9/2022,"More than 150,000 people have died in the UK from coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to government figures. Britain on Saturday became the seventh country to pass the milestone after the US, Brazil, India, Russia, Mexico and Peru.  It comes after an additional 313 deaths were recorded, bringing the pandemic total to 150,057 people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid. However, separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 174,000 deaths registered in the UK where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. In the past seven days, 1,271 people have died, a 38% rise on the week before. It comes as an additional 146,390 Covid cases were reported on Saturday, bringing the overall total since the start of the pandemic to 14,333,794. In the past seven days alone, 1,227,288 people have tested positive, according to official figures, marking more than a 10% rise on the week before. Last January, the UK became the first European country to pass 100,000 deaths. While the latest wave of the virus, driven by the Omicron variant, has not led to deaths rising as quickly as during previous waves, hospitals are under increasing pressure as admissions and Covid-related staff absences rise. Earlier this week, Boris Johnson insisted England can “ride out” its biggest ever Covid wave “without shutting down our country once again”. But the prime minister admitted that parts of the NHS would feel “temporarily overwhelmed”. While England is currently under plan b restrictions, which include mandatory face masks in most public indoor spaces and advice to work from home where possible, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have introduced tougher measures, including for socialising and events. Across the UK, 18,454 people were in hospital with coronavirus on Thursday, according to government figures, a 40% week-on-week rise and the highest number since 18 February.",News/World news,"UK first country in Europe to pass 150,000 Covid deaths, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/uk-first-country-in-europe-to-pass-150000-covid-deaths-figures-show
1/9/2022,"Red flares were thrown from the celebrating home end and blue from the despairing away fans, but when Amari Morgan-Smith ran away celebrating what turned out to be the winning goal in the 82nd minute, everyone associated with Kidderminster Harriers seemed to be personally involved. Everyone in red piled on: all the outfield players of course, the substitutes, the goalkeeper Luke Simpson, who ran 70 yards to join in, the coaches, the manager. The bottle-washer and the tea lady weren’t far behind. It was pandemonium and, as the Reading fans chanted “This is embarrassing” and a yellow card was shown to their coach, the board came up to show there would be 12 added minutes. This had been a drama a long time brewing.  In the end there were another 14 minutes before the referee, Gavin Ward, blew the final whistle and Aggborough witnessed the kind of pitch invasion to warm the cockles of neutral hearts, sending the man on the PA into palpitations as he attempted to restore order. No chance. Reading, 79 places above Kidderminster in the football pyramid, failed to make their professionalism count. In a season in which they have been docked six points and fallen from seventh in the Championship to just above the relegation places, this was a new low. The 2015 FA Cup semi-finalists join Preston North End and Birmingham as Kidderminster’s biggest scalps and this will be a day the 5,100 fans in attendance will surely never forget. George Puscas had given Reading the lead in first-half stoppage time but even before Sam Austin, the Kidderminster captain, had equalised midway through the second half, the sense of an upset was always on. The scene had appeared set long before kick-off. After conceding two late goals to draw with Derby on Monday, Reading’s status as “giants” waiting to be felled was only enhanced when Veljko Paunovic, their manager, made eight changes, naming six players aged 21 or under. If the football was largely cautious in the first half, there was a red flare thrown on to the pitch from the home end before kick-off and a blue one to celebrate Puscas’s goal. Reading’s opener was a shame for the neutral, as Kidderminster had acquitted themselves very well in the first 45 minutes. Russ Penn’s non-league players started aggressively, kept their shape and even started looking like scoring before Puscas’s strike. Any early Kidderminster nerves were settled when Simpson botched his clearance but then saved superbly at the feet of Mamadi Camará after Puscas, in an offside position, had sensibly opted let his teammate take control. Kidderminster’s best spell came in the five minutes before the goal, ironically. Ashley Hemmings wanted a penalty as he felt Tom Holmes, the Reading captain, breathing down his neck and failed to get a shot away, but from the loose ball Morgan-Smith did strike goalwards and Rafael Cabral had to save well. The Reading goalkeeper then produced the save of the day – the kind of intervention that can tip a tie, perhaps even turn a club’s season around. Omari Sterling-James must have been at least 30 yards out when he let fly with his right-footed shot but, as it dipped down towards the top corner, Cabral turned the ball over the crossbar. Even from Hemming’s’s corner Reading looked vulnerable, as Morgan-Smith nodded the ball back in and Mark Carrington flicked his header back over the top. It looked as if Kidderminster would go in level at the break but then Danny Drinkwater, who had been roundly jeered every time he got the ball for the crime of having won a Premier League title seven years ago, played a ball into the feet of Tom Dele-Bashiru and Puscas scored his first goal for nine months with an assured first-time shot. Reading made all five substitutes, the last when one replacement, Felipe Araruna, had to be taken off on a stretcher on only his second appearance after more than a year out with a serious knee injury. Perhaps the changes unsettled Reading but Austin started to scent there was a chance. The former Burton Albion player eschewed the opportunity to square a pass as he raided down the right wing, cut back inside and flashed a left-footed effort just wide of the far post. Then came the moment that Austin will remember for the rest of his career. Caleb Richards headed a cross from the right back to Kidderminster’s creative pivot and, even if his shot from the edge of the area wasn’t the purest connection, Cabral fumbled the ball and it snuck over the line. Aggborough has witnessed some famous moments over the years, but after 82 minutes the roof nearly came off the stand behind the goal. Hemmings delivered an inswinging corner from the right and as an almighty scramble ensued at the near post as Cabral failed to take his catch, before Morgan-Smith turned the ball over the line.",Sport/Football,Kidderminster’s Amari Morgan-Smith stuns Reading to pull off FA Cup upset,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/kidderminster-reading-fa-cup-match-report
