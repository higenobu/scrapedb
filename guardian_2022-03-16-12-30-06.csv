3/16/2022,"It has become a source of dark irony among climate activists globally that court decisions denying their search for climate action begin by recognising the existential risk posed by the climate crisis. And so it went on Tuesday, when the full federal court delivered its judgment in the landmark Sharma case. “The threat of climate change and global warming was and is not in dispute between the parties in this litigation,” began chief justice James Allsop. What, then, does the judiciary – the third, independent and co-equal branch of government – propose to do about it? In the face of crippling climate inaction from the federal executive and legislative government that threatens to render Australia effectively uninhabitable in the centuries ahead, how will the courts react? On Tuesday, the full federal court overturned a landmark earlier decision that found the federal environment minister owed a duty of care to Australian children to mitigate climate risk in considering whether to approve a major coalmine expansion. Each writing separately, the three judges – Allsop, Michael Wheelahan and Jonathan Beach – accepted the minister’s appeal in a nearly 300-page judgment. “We are dealing with core, indeed, high policy-making,” wrote Allsop in deciding that the claim was not suited for judicial determination. “To the extent that the evidence and the uncontested risks of climate catastrophe call forth a duty of the minister or the executive of the commonwealth, it is a political duty: to the people of Australia,” he added. It is cold comfort for future generations who will suffer because of the government’s failure to fulfil that duty today. Much will be written in the weeks, months and years ahead about this significant moment for climate litigation in Australia. My comments are necessarily preliminary. But my overarching reaction is one of despair. Sharma is a judgment founded on centuries of jurisprudence – that, of course, is one of the strengths of the common law. But the common law evolves. Australia, and the world, has never faced a challenge of this nature. If not now, in light of all we know about climate harm and the government’s climate inaction (including, relevantly in the present case, approving a coalmine that will lead to an additional 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide), then when? Tuesday’s judgment was not all bad news. The considerable divergence between the three judges meant that this was not a slam-dunk for the government, an immovable obstacle to future claims. While Allsop appeared most concerned that the question was primarily a political rather than a judicial one, echoed to a lesser extent by Wheelahan, Beach rejected this line of argument. “In summary, I accept that policy questions are involved. But whatever they may be, they can adequately be dealt with,” he held. Instead, Beach rejected the case on more technical legal grounds. That leaves the door open to future claims, perhaps more narrowly framed, succeeding. Indeed, all three judges highlighted their desire to avoid foreclosing future litigation; they have sought further submissions about the resolution of the case, to “ensure that” other climate litigants are not “unduly prejudiced” by the outcome. There were also tea leaves from the three judges, even Allsop, about the possibility of a duty of care where there is closer nexus between the risk and the harm (he used the example of the government approving an asbestos mine near a large city). Such comments will no doubt be explored in future litigation. First, though, the plaintiffs in Sharma will consider whether to appeal to the high court. In that consideration they will take heart from Beach, the most sympathetic of the appeal bench to their claim. Noting that some of the legal concepts that stood in the way of the teenage plaintiffs “in their present form may have reached their shelf life”, he mused that “it is for the high court not us to engineer new seed varieties for sustainable duties of care”. Whether in Sharma or another case, Australia’s climate inaction will soon reach the nation’s highest court. In that context, some of the comments in Tuesday’s judgment about institutional restraint will be less applicable – the high court can, and does, rewrite the law. It should do so. It is often said that hard cases make bad law. There is no doubt that the issues posed in Sharma are immensely difficult – perhaps the most challenging that courts will ever face. Reasonable minds disagree about the extent of appropriate judicial intervention in the climate crisis. But what is most dispiriting about the Sharma decision is that in seeking to respect institutional boundaries, it goes a large way towards abandoning the field altogether. Climate (in)action is political, Allsop held, and courts should leave such policy-making to politicians. In the ultimate analysis, what is the point of our law, if not to protect Australians from the most significant existential risk ever faced? What is the point of our constitution if Australia becomes all-but uninhabitable – a land of fire, flood and drought? As our coal-loving government sends us towards climate oblivion, the federal court says: we see the risk, but cannot act.  Kieran Pender is a writer and lawyer.

3/16/2022,"A strange, sad fashion month had its coda on Tuesday night, with the presentation of Alexander McQueen’s autumn/winter collection in a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York City. Models walked around large piles of artfully arranged mulch which, the brand’s creative director Sarah Burton said backstage, were made from trees that had “fallen down naturally” and would afterwards be donated to farms and artists’ projects. She added that 85% of the collection was produced from “sustainable, recyclable fabrics,” including all of the polyester. The collection was heavy on reliable hits: ruffled ballgowns paired with ankle boots, trench coats, trouser suits with exaggerated shoulders. There were also punk references – leather jackets and fraying, holey, oversized knits – that recalled the work of the brand’s founder, Lee McQueen. A handful of looks used a printed fabric inspired by the dress famously spray painted by robots live on the runway in 1999, as part of McQueen’s Collection No. 13. Bright block colours – acid yellow, tomato red and tangerine – were taken from photographs of mushrooms, “the incredible colours that you get in nature,” Burton said. In notes distributed at the show, Burton explained that her overall inspiration was mycelium, the root-like filaments of a fungus. “Mycelium has the most profound, interconnecting power, relaying messages through a magical underground structure, allowing trees to reach out to each other when either they or their young need help or are sick,” she said. Celebrating community and interconnectedness now, she added, seemed “more important than ever.” Mushrooms and mycelium fabrics have been hailed as a sustainable alternative to leather, but none were used in the collection, though Burton said the company had been trailing them and hoped to use them in the future. “It’s working,” she said, “but we didn’t want to do it until we had enough product.” Burton took over from Lee McQueen, after 14 years as his right hand woman, after the designer’s death in 2010. Since then, under Burton and luxury conglomerate Kering, which has owned the brand since 2001, it has expanded into more commercial categories, including accessories and footwear. Now, the once anti-establishment label is a royal favourite: Burton designed the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress in 2011. Earlier this month the Duchess wore a light blue jumper by the label – to match a blue and yellow Ukrainian flag pin – on a visit to London’s Ukrainian Cultural Centre. In April, chief executive Emmanuel Gintzburger said he wanted to make Alexander McQueen “one of the most powerful luxury houses in the world”. The brand’s decision to cleave from the traditional fashion week schedule, to show collections in impactful moments – and locations – of its own choosing, as with Tuesday’s New York show, appears to be part of that plan. This latest round of fashion shows often felt surreal and jarring, taking place as war broke out in Ukraine. Ukrainian models and fashion editors were stranded in western Europe, while questions were raised about the industry’s patronage by Russian oligarchs. At the beginning of March, Alexander McQueen’s parent company Kering shut its Russian shops and online operations, as did LVMH brands including Dior, as well as H&M, Chanel and Hermes. Russian consumers account for about 3% of global luxury sales.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Nature looms large at Alexander McQueen’s autumn/winter show in New York,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/16/nature-looms-large-at-alexander-mcqueens-autumnwinter-show-in-new-york
3/16/2022,"After two years of Covid and now Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the resilience of the global interlinked supply chains is being continually tested. Now China’s zero Covid strategy is being challenged for the first time since the virus was first detected in the central city of Wuhan, with outbreaks in many cities. How might the outbreak and subsequent severe lockdowns affect Australia, which relies on China as its biggest trade partner by far? And could there be a further twist if Beijing’s close ties to Moscow end up snaring China’s economy in the growing web of international sanctions over Russia’s war? More than 5,000 new cases were reported by the Chinese government on Tuesday, the most since the early days of the Wuhan outbreak, according to Bloomberg. The list of regions with tight lockdowns already include the southern technology hubs of Shenzhen and Dongguan, covering 23 million people between them, and the north-eastern province of Jilin, with a similar number of residents. Add in megacities such as Shanghai and provincial capitals like Xi’an, and large parts of the economy are suddenly in hibernation. As #China’s officials continue to pursue a “zero-#Covid” strategy aiming for elimination in each outbreak, there’re more than 50 million residents under strict, stay at home, lockdown today. Then add those under softer “quasi-lockdown” measures that’s more like 90 million people. Betty Wang, ANZ’s senior economist in Hong Kong, says the lockdowns will certainly dent the economy. “A one-week lockdown of the affected areas could cause [a drop of] as much as 0.8 percentage points in GDP growth,” Wang says. That’s significant given the government’s predicted growth rate of 5.5% for 2022. ANZ is predicting a 5% growth rate is more likely. But, as in Australia, Beijing is not sitting back. It’s planning a ¥2.5tn (A$500bn) tax cut and rebate plan to stoke growth among other support, Wang says. Disruptions in Shenzhen, dubbed China’s Silicon Valley, will send wide ripples. Foxconn, an assembler of iPhones, suspended production, helping to send Apple shares lower on Monday before they rebounded during trading on Tuesday. Toyota and Volkswagen, which have plants in Jilin, were among other firms affected. Effects, though, should prove temporary – provided the lockdowns aren’t prolonged, Wang said. The current state of the Chinese economy going into the Covid lockdown, though, was already mixed. After the first two months of 2022, the economy performed better than expected in areas such as spending on so-called fixed assets such as roads, with 12.2% growth – more than double the 5% pace economists predicted. Retail sales grew 6.7%, or twice the 3% rate forecast, while even investment in the debt-wracked property sector rose almost 4% when a fall of 7% was tipped, according to CBA senior Asia economist Kevin Xie. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The one weak spot in [Tuesday’s] data was a lift in the surveyed jobless rate to 5.5%, indicating increased stress in the labour market,” Xie said. “We expect consumption, the weak spot over the past two years, will again be hurt the most compared to production and exports in March,” he said. “Moreover, the continued weakness in the property sector, elevated geopolitical tensions, and tighter regulations in the tech sector continue to weigh on economic growth.” Those geopolitical tensions include China’s close relations with Russia. Speculation that the US might retaliate if Beijing goes out of its way to help Moscow, including undermining sanctions, has already hurt Chinese firms listed on US markets and more could follow. It’s “another black swan” that needs watching closely, the ANZ’s Wang says. As a close ally of the US, Australia would be expected to echo any sanctions imposed on China or Chinese companies for helping Russia, much as it joined the US in banning Russian oil imports. But unlike sanctions against Russia, such a move against China would have a dramatic impact on Australia’s economy. In the meantime, there are some positives for Australian exporters. Every time China’s economy stumbles, the government amps up spending on roads, bridges and other buildings, moves that tend to boost demand for raw materials. That helps commodity exporters such as Australia, where higher iron ore or other material prices boost corporate profits and bolster budget coffers. The tax take for Australian governments rises about $2bn for every 10% rise in global coal and gas prices, Chris Richardson, a senior economist at Deloitte, says. He adds that the boost from rising iron ore prices could be even greater, assuming they go up and stay up. But for Australian businesses, Covid-related lockdowns risk a further deterioration of already critical supply constraints, says Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The ACCI-Westpac Survey of Industrial Trends, released on Tuesday, showed Australian manufacturers are facing the worst material shortages since the 1974 oil shock. Profits will suffer from any more disruptions if input costs rise more than they can pass on, he said. “International supply chain bottlenecks are producing material constraints on a scale not seen in almost 50 years,” McKellar says. “The Chinese lockdowns reaffirm the need to continue diversification of critical supply chains, ensuring that Australian businesses can source key components of production.”",News/Business,What could China’s zero Covid strategy mean for Australian business?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/what-could-chinas-zero-covid-strategy-mean-for-australian-business
