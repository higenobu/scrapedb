4/5/2022,"The number of new cars sold in the UK slumped by 14% in March because of the ongoing semiconductor shortages and the cost of living crisis, as electric vehicles enjoyed a record month. The slump in new car registrations, which follows two months of year-on-year sales increases, comes as the cost of petrol and diesel continues to soar to record levels. However, there were 39, 315 new electric vehicle (EV) registrations in March, more in a single month than the total sold in the UK in 2019. as buyers are increasingly choosing more environmentally friendly forms of transport with cheaper running costs. “At the current rate, sales of new electric vehicles (EVs) will overtake both traditional petrol and diesel sales by 2025,” said Ian Plummer, the director at AutoTrader. “There was already massive growth in this segment and, if anything, the demand for EVs is now even stronger as prices at the pumps rise on the back of the Ukraine crisis.” However, increased sales of electric vehicles will also mean more demand for electric charging points. In February, the Resolution Foundation warned that 10m homes do not have access to off-street parking or a personal garage, so will miss out on lower costs from charging the cars using cheaper overnight electricity. “Ministers need to make sure we can accommodate that predicted growth,” Plummer said. The slump in overall UK car sales in March, usually the strongest month of the year, follows a 41% fall in production in February, to the lowest levels since the 1950s. The 14% fall in new car sales last month will take registrations below 250,000, compared to the March average of 450,000 in the decade before the pandemic. “The industry’s lingering supply chain issues mean the traditional March rush for new registration plates has been flattened out by continued stock shortages,” Plummer said.

4/5/2022,"Laura Samani’s debut feature is a movie folktale: hard, weathered and knotted, like a piece of driftwood. In north-east Italy at the beginning of the 20th century, a young woman called Agata (Celeste Cescutti) is in shock after the stillborn death of her first child. Her priest tells her that the child is now doomed to wander Limbo in eternity because the baby died before being baptised. Agata is shown undergoing a folk redemption or healing ceremony on the beach, but for her it is clearly more like her own kind of desolate emotional funeral; yet Agata hears that there is a church somewhere to the north whose priest has the supernatural power to bring a dead child back to life for a single breath, enough for a baptism and to elevate its immortal soul. So Agata digs the baby up under cover of darkness and heads off with the tiny casket tied grimly on her back, like a pilgrim; she is befriended in the forest by the semi-feral Lynx (Ondina Quadri) who is to be her only friend on their desperately gruelling and dangerous journey. There are some amazing scenes and locations in this film, which has the air of a magical parable, like something by Alice Rohrwacher; I thought there might even be a tiny touch of Lars von Trier’s Breaking the Waves. The ending is, arguably, broadly guessable and some have expressed their dissatisfaction with the way that it is presented. I myself found my own objections were more about the hallucination-visionary scenes underwater which have become a bit of a movie cliche. Yet Samani’s film-making language has consistency and urgency, and there is an interesting streak of atheism that goes alongside this movie’s spiritual aura.  Small Body is released on 8 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Small Body review – a sublimely shot parable of spiritual redemption,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/05/small-body-review-a-sublimely-shot-parable-of-spiritual-redemption
4/5/2022,"From Tracy Beaker to The Illustrated Mum, Jacqueline Wilson has long written about difficult childhoods. In Baby Love (Penguin, £12.99), her first novel aimed at teenage readers for several years, she tackles the thorny topic of teen pregnancy. Laura is a painfully naive 14-year-old in suburban 1960 when, flattered by the attentions of a French exchange student, a fateful walk home changes her life for ever. Fearful of societal shame, her parents send her to a mother-and-baby home to have the child and give it up for adoption. Wilson, who writes about the lives of girls with such compassion, is particularly perceptive on the complexities of friendships and the realities of the British class system. Heartbreaking, yet full of warmth and hope. Also tackling big themes with a light touch is Christine Pillainayagam, a new voice in teenage fiction with her debut, Ellie Pillai Is Brown (Faber, £8.99, May). Fifteen-year-old Ellie describes herself as “somewhere between invisible and not very cool”, stumbling through the classic teen tribulations of first love, friendships, school and parental expectations, underpinned by the challenges of being brown in a very white town. An aspiring songwriter, Ellie’s favourite song lyrics are peppered throughout the book as she strives to find her own voice. There’s more school drama in Simon James Green’s Gay Club! (Scholastic, £7.99, May), which sees the election for LGBTQ+ club president spark backstabbing and politics. A memorable cast shines in this smart, comedic novel that takes an astute but affectionate look at the gay community. Green is one of the UK’s funniest writers for young people, often focusing on gay teenagers in his work; I hope this is the book to earn him a wider audience. In Erik J Brown’s debut, All That’s Left in the World (Hodder, £7.99), a super-flu significantly more deadly than Covid-19 has decimated the population. Two lonely, displaced boys make a treacherous journey down the eastern seaboard through a society in ruins, punctuated by escaped zoo animals and, most treacherous of all, other survivors. A slow-burning, heartfelt love story plays out against this post-apocalyptic backdrop, bringing hope and nuance to familiar survivalist themes. Aneesa Marufu’s debut, The Balloon Thief (Chicken House, £7.99), sees Khadija escape her destiny of arranged marriage and boredom by fleeing in a hot-air balloon, along with unlikely accomplice Jacob, one of the oppressed hari people. As they race across a vividly realised desert kingdom, the duo are swept into an exhilarating adventure of black magic, djinns and revolution, with powerful themes of racism and oppression woven into the action. A major award winner in the US for middle-grade novels including The Girl Who Drank the Moon, Kelly Barnhill brings her exquisite writing to older readers in When Women Were Dragons (Hot Key, £14.99, May). It’s set in an alternative 1950s America, where thousands of women and girls spontaneously transform into dragons, an event so shocking that it is forbidden to even acknowledge it. In this soaring coming-of-age novel, Alex brings up her younger cousin Beatrice, awakening to independence, feminism and identity as she navigates Bea’s urge to “dragon”. Fans of modern feminist classics such as The Power will find much to admire here; for teenage readers and beyond.

4/5/2022,"One recent Friday afternoon far-right militia figure Ammon Bundy started a live video feed on his YouTube channel in the wake of being arrested on trespassing charges at a hospital in Idaho, where he is running for governor. Bundy appeared disappointed to tell his followers what he believed the government was forcing him to do next. He looked down at the camera, wearing an open-collared shirt and his usual cowboy hat, and let out a sigh. Then he threatened a sitting Idaho judge, summoning his supporters to go to his home. Addressing his followers, he told them: “I’m calling on you to put off whatever you’re doing tomorrow, and come to [the judge’s] house … Patriot groups all across Idaho and around the country, I cannot try to hold you back any longer.” What had excised Bundy so much was a child custody case. But what his actions really revealed was a troubling development in America’s ever-more divided political landscape where far-right figures feel emboldened enough to threaten a judge, wield their followers against the institutions of the state and where an implicit threat of violence is increasingly present as they seek elected office. By the time Bundy made his remarks, his 17,000 YouTube subscribers were receiving near daily updates about a 10-month-old child near Boise, Idaho, who was taken into temporary protection from his parents after officials determined the child was suffering from severe malnourishment and in imminent danger. Diego Rodriguez, Bundy’s campaign consultant and friend, is the grandfather of the child at the center of a controversy in which even the far-right deputy governor, Janice McGeachin, has become embroiled. An ultra-converative pastor, Rodriguez is emblematic of the Christian fringe pushing to create a US “theocracy” in Idaho. Bundy railed against what he considered a “kidnapping” at the hands of the government. After an Ada county judge signed a warrant transferring temporary custody of the child to health and wellness officials, Bundy urged his followers – who are often armed – to physically descend on the judge’s house, to the deep alarm of local police. It was hardly Bundy’s first time in the headlines. Nor was it even his first time getting his followers to swarm an Idaho judge’s home, following a similar call in 2021. Bundy and his family have long been established figures in anti-government folklore after leading an armed standoff at their ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada. For 20 years Cliven Bundy, Ammon Bundy’s father, avoided paying grazing fees to the Bureau of Land Management, insisting that his cattle had more right to the land than the federal government. When armed federal agents were sent to confiscate the cattle for non-payment, hundreds of protesters and some armed militia members came to their support. Charges for Cliven and his two sons, Ammon and Ryan, were dismissed after a mistrial in which the federal prosecutor failed to turn over evidence and disclose the existence of surveillance camera footage and the presence of federal snipers in the area. Two years later in 2016 Ammon Bundy led a high-profile armed takeover and lengthy occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refugee, a sanctuary for birds in eastern Oregon. That year Ammon and Ryan Bundy were charged with conspiracy in federal court but again found not guilty. But Bundy has adapted to new times in US politics as the Republican party has lurched right under the influence of Donald Trump, and far-right militia groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers have dominated headlines, including after the January 6 assault on the Capitol. Bundy, however, has attracted far less attention as he built up a state-by-state-level, cell-like network that can host dinners to create a sense of community but also produce on-demand protesters. Bundy’s People’s Rights Network aims to form a coalition of militia members, anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, preppers and other far-right travelers. Its size eclipses most far-right groups put together. And many experts see it as a real threat to democracy. “They’ve repeatedly shown an ability to mobilize large number of armed far-right activists to threaten, harass, and intimidate public officials,” said Devin Bernhardt, director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, a non-profit that monitors the far right. While 2021 saw a retreat for many of the national far-right groups as they came under intense scrutiny from law enforcement, People’s Rights Network grew last year by 53%. Today it has 33,000 members across 38 states, according to a report from the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights. “Ammon Bundy, with People’s Rights Network, was the first to grasp on to Covid-19 denial as a mobilizing vehicle. The first to galvanize militants to oppose Covid-19 restrictions and to meld together anti-vaxxers, paramilitaries, Proud Boys and others into a larger movement to protest and protect these kinds of efforts,” said Bernhardt. Bernhardt says Bundy has shown the ability to radicalize people by “engaging in local conflict. Whether that’s showing up at vaccination sites and threatening healthcare providers or showing up at school boards and harassing school board members.” In the case of the call for militias to descend on the Ada county judge’s home, local police announced the baby at the center of the spat would be returned to the parents under stipulations agreed upon by the court. In a statement, Meridian police concluded with a plea: “There is no need to continue protesting or harassing our public health officials, police officers or anyone else involved.” Bundy called off the protest. But within a week Bundy had announced a new rally – a potluck to recruit new members to the cause. “Ammon Bundy is important because in many ways his efforts are a bellwether for where the paramilitary side of the movement is moving,” said Bernhardt.",News/US news,How far-right figures like Ammon Bundy ccause chaos in US politics,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/ammon-bundy-far-right-idaho
4/5/2022,"The Victorian gambling regulator has used new laws, under which it can levy fines of up to $100m, to launch disciplinary action against Crown Resorts for disguising casino spending as accommodation expenses. It is the first action the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission has taken and is based on findings of a royal commission into Crown’s Melbourne casino, the group’s biggest, with the regulator promising there will be more to come. The VGCCC said it informed Crown of the proceedings on Tuesday and would consider the company’s response before making a further announcement. In his report, tabled in state parliament in October, the royal commissioner Ray Finkelstein found that Crown allowed Chinese high rollers to use China UnionPay cards to transfer money to Crown’s hotel, Crown Towers. “The hotel issued a room charge bill to the patron, falsely asserting that the hotel had provided services to the person,” Finkelstein said in his report. “The patron would pay the bill and be given a voucher acknowledging the receipt of funds. Then the patron, accompanied by a Crown VIP host, took the voucher to the cage and exchanged it for cash or chips.” The inquiry heard that the casino started allowing clients to use this method, which evaded Chinese currency controls, in 2012 at the latest. Evidence before the inquiry shows that Crown workers raised concerns it might amount to money laundering but the company did not stop allowing the method until after employees were arrested in China in 2016 on allegations of illegal gambling promotion. In his report, Finkelstein said that “wealthy Chinese patrons were assisted in illegally transferring up to $160m in funds from their country”. It was one of his reasons for finding Crown was not fit to hold a casino licence, although the company has been allowed to continue to run the Melbourne operation under strict new conditions and after promising to reform itself. An inquiry in NSW has heard a similar scheme operated at rival casino Star, allowing the transfer of a total of $900m.

It also increased the maximum fine from $1m to $100m. “These powers are needed to deter Crown from engaging in the conduct that was revealed during the royal commission,” the VGCCC chair, Fran Thorn, said. “As a first step, we are acting on the royal commission’s findings that Crown’s China UnionPay process breached important Victorian regulatory obligations, was illegal and constituted serious misconduct.” Crown has been contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,Regulator launches disciplinary action against Crown Resorts after royal commission findings,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/regulator-launches-disciplinary-action-against-crown-resorts-after-royal-commission-findings
4/5/2022,"We are so close to a federal election now that the distinction between the faux campaign and the real one is basically nonexistent. But as the real contest creeps closer to being officially called, there’s a thorny problem for the Liberal campaign to navigate – how do you win an election when, for some voters, Scott Morrison is the problem? The components of this challenge have been clear for some time. Opinion polls show Morrison has lost standing over the past 12 months. Voter approval of Morrison in the Guardian Essential poll dived 19 points over the course of last year. Morrison knows voters have cooled since the glory days of “ScoMo” in his baseball cap wandering around the country enthusing “how good”, so he has been busy setting up a “better the devil you know” election contest rather than a Sally Field one (“you like me, you really like me”). If you look carefully at what Morrison says, it’s clear the prime minister understands he’s a drag on the brand in some parts of the country. Some strategists say the simplest way to characterise the current dynamic is thus: the prime minister is a minus in the cities but a plus in the regions. Obviously, that’s an oversimplification, but conceptually it’s useful. But voters souring on the candidate isn’t the only conundrum for Morrison’s backroom to manage. The other significant risk to war game is the persistence and virulence of blue-on-blue attacks – the recent character assassination by the conservative stalwart Concetta Fierravanti-Wells being a case in point. These score-settling insurgencies (before Labor picks up the slack with negative advertising during the campaign) are ominous in the sense they have escalated as the real contest draws closer, which suggests there is every prospect they will go on happening in ways Morrison and his strategists can neither influence nor control. If you are a professional political operation (and the Liberal party is) in this environment, the overriding objective becomes ensuring your marginal seat holders and candidates in targeted seats have the tools – both practical and rhetorical – to ride out a negative public backlash against the prime minister. This is a really tough ask when low-information voters can talk your ear off about how Morrison gives them the creeps but they wouldn’t have a clue who their local member is. So less than ideal, it’s fair to say. But sandbagging the local members becomes the only viable option a campaign has when the national mood sours on the incumbent, and combatants are lining up to roast your prime ministerial candidate, not furtively, but in plain sight. Speaking of plain sight, there’s a case study we can look at. Let’s consider the language of the Liberal backbench Bridget Archer, who holds the ultra marginal seat Tasmanian of Bass after snatching it from Labor in 2019 by a margin of 600 votes. To be clear. Archer isn’t a political drone. She says and does what she thinks, so I’m not suggesting she’s been coached intensively by a travelling posse of svengalis about how best to inoculate herself from an unpopular prime minister. But her language, if you listen, is interesting. On the ABC on Tuesday morning, Archer noted the only people in Australia who can actually vote Morrison out are the residents of Cook, the prime minister’s Sydney electorate. She said Australia did not have a presidential system. The system here allows voters to make judgments on the quality of representation provided by their local members. Archer encouraged voters to make the distinction between her and the prime minister. The looming referendum in Bass should be about her record, not Morrison’s. “If there was no value in local representation, why would we bother having elections,” Archer reasoned – adding “if we were all interchangeable, we wouldn’t bother doing this”. Just in case her point wasn’t clear, she said: “The people of Bass are my boss and my loyalty lies with them.” Archer is her own person. She’s not afraid to exercise her own judgments. But this language suggests a permission structure, either sanctioned or improvised (in the sense of making a virtue of necessity) that will probably be repeated in the electorates that will ultimately determine who wins the election. Let’s call this “permission to distance”. Not overt disavowal. Just distance. Given the current voter disaffection with Morrison crosses over in some places to disaffection with the Liberal party, we’ve also seen some Liberal candidates distance themselves from the usual party branding. Dave Sharma, running in the Sydney seat of Wentworth, has recently denied he’s engaged in strategic distancing after accusations his campaign materials mimic the teal colour scheme of the independent candidate Allegra Spender. For the record, the Liberals currently hold Wentworth with a 1.3% margin, and an independent held it before Sharma wrested it back. Sharma recently told Guardian Australia in a text exchange: “I’m the incumbent here, I’ve always been on the blue spectrum, and I didn’t think anyone owned colours!” Back in Tasmania, Eric Abetz is running a below-the-line campaign for the Senate with ubiquitous materials that do not mention the Liberal party. That fascinating improvisation reflects the fact Abetz was dumped from the number one spot on the Liberal ticket. But his current pitch also reflects the potent appeal of micro-parties and independents in the state. So the sandbagging and inoculation strategy is clear enough. What remains unclear at this point is whether operation permission to distance from Morrison can work. As they say in the classics, only time will tell.",News/Australia news,"With Scott Morrison on the nose in parts of the country, Liberal MPs may want ‘permission to distance’ | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/with-scott-morrison-on-the-nose-in-parts-of-the-country-liberal-mps-have-been-given-permission-to-distance
4/5/2022,"The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow across parts of Scotland, warning of expected disruption to roads and railways. The warning was issued from 6am to 10pm on Tuesday for an area covering much of Highland and Grampian. “Snow may cause some disruption across parts of Scotland through Tuesday before clearing northwards,” the Met Office said in its warning. “Some roads and railways [are] likely to be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.” The Met Office indicated there was a chance of up to 5cm of snow settling at low levels by Wednesday morning and 5cm at 300 metres above sea level – which it said was most likely across Caithness, Sutherland, and Ross and Cromarty. The weather across other parts of the UK is expected to feature further snow, sub-zero temperatures and heavy rain, with daytime temperature highs expected to reach average levels for this time of year. For most of the week there will be windy conditions and downpours in most areas across the UK, with the Met Office predicting overnight temperatures could drop below freezing. Jonathan Vautrey, a Met Office forecaster, said: “The general theme is for the weather to be unsettled. There will be a damp and cloudy start to the working week for most with further outbreaks of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday in Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. There will also be a more persistent band of rain across southern areas by Thursday.” Forecasters expect a wet start for most places on Wednesday, but with southern areas of the UK expected to have no rain. There will also be more widespread showers in the afternoon with a moderate breeze.
