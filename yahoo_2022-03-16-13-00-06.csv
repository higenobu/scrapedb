3/16/2022,"Almond Brewer was surrounded by Arizona police after a credit union manager doubted the authenticity of an account holder’s check. Authorities were called on a Black Arizona man attempting to cash a check he received after selling a boat. The man, Almond Brewer, went to Pinal County Federal Credit Union in Apache Junction to cash the $3,200 check only to be surrounded by police after a manager doubted its authenticity. According to a local report from 12 News, the incident occurred in October 2021 when the credit union manager called 911 — while Brewer waited — and told them the personal check was fake. The report notes that Brewer told the teller he had received the check after selling his boat to a woman on Facebook Marketplace, “and she looked kind of surprised.” According to the bank, the check had “red flags” like an old log of the credit union, as well as a routing and checking account number that didn’t match the member’s information. However, after running the check through a third-party verifier, its authenticity was deemed “inconclusive,” a fact the manager did not tell the police. When contacted by the credit union — after the police had been called — the account holder verified she’d signed the check, but police didn’t learn that until 10 minutes into their interaction with a stunned Brewer. “It was just, ‘oh, you know, Black guy locks in his hair, tattoos, came on a Harley, you know?'” Brewer told 12 News. “Let’s assume the worst.” “Why embarrass somebody like that? Why, you know, make them feel less than a man,” he later wondered. In a statement, issued in January, Amy Marshall, president and CEO of the Pinal County Federal Credit Union, said that “at no time did the staff feel threatened or feel Mr. Brewer was trying to rob the credit union.” She noted that police were already en route when the manager got the verbal check verification from its customer and maintained the staff apologized to both the law enforcement officials who responded and to Brewer himself. They had “seen an uptick in fraudulent activity,” Marshall wrote, and their “ultimate responsibility” is to ensure safe and secure accounts. She added that their team undergoes diversity and inclusion training and said they would be reviewing their processes. “Mr. Brewer, on behalf of Pinal County Federal Credit Union,” she concluded, “I would like to formally apologize for this confusing experience while visiting one of our branch locations.” The situation is reminiscent of a recent, now-viral incident involving Black Panther director Ryan Coogler, who was handcuffed by police in Georgia while attempting to withdraw $12,000 from his checking account at a Bank of America branch.

3/16/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -The U.S. consulate in the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo will close temporarily after it was hit by gunfire overnight, and trailers were set ablaze on roads downtown after a gang leader's arrest, authorities said on Monday. Shots against the consulate and Mexican military premises were reported amid gunfighting and pursuits in parts of the city that lies opposite Laredo, Texas, the ministry of public security in the state of Tamaulipas said in a statement. Suspected gang members paralyzed traffic in Nuevo Laredo early Monday by blocking roads with spike strips and setting fire to trailer trucks, the statement said. The U.S. consulate advised its employees to stay indoors and urged U.S. citizens to do the same or avoid the area. The consulate will be temporarily closed to the public, the Mexican government said later in a statement. A senior Tamaulipas official told Reuters there was at least one ""collateral"" fatality due to the violence. The gunfight followed the arrest of Juan Gerardo Trevino, or ""El Huevo,"" on Sunday, Mexico's government said in a statement. Trevino is facing a U.S. extradition order for drug trafficking and money laundering, as well as state-level charges for murder, terrorism, extortion and criminal association, it added. He is also a U.S. citizen, a Mexican government official told Reuters. Trevino is on a list of the U.S. Border Patrol's most wanted criminals, according to media reports. The Mexican statement named Trevino as the leader of the Cartel of the Northeast, a branch of the Zetas gang, as well as boss of hitman group ""Tropas del Infierno"" (Troops from Hell). The arrest represents a ""forceful blow"" to the cartel's power in the region, Mexico's government said. The government said in its later statement it was committed to security cooperation with the United States and that crime organizations involved in the incident will face the weight of the law of both countries.

3/16/2022,"The video shows a Russian missile launcher sitting in the open. Suddenly, it is enveloped in a huge fireball. Ukrainian officials say what looked like a video game was actually the work of a small, relatively cheap Turkish-made drone that has had a surprisingly lethal impact on Russia forces. A U.S. defense official said Monday that Ukraine has made “terrific” use of Turkish Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which can loiter over tanks and artillery and destroy them with devastatingly accurate missile fire. The official said the U.S. is working to help keep the drones flying. Ukraine received a new shipment of the drones this month, Ukraine’s defense minister said on Facebook. He didn’t say how many. It’s unclear whether the U.S. has made efforts to facilitate the supply of the Turkish drone or other similar systems to Ukraine, in addition to the Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles it is providing. Video: Video shows apparent Ukrainian drone strike on Russian forces Before the war began, military experts predicted that Russian forces would have little trouble dealing with Ukraine’s complement of as many as 20 Turkish drones. With a price tag in the single-digit millions, the Bayraktars are far cheaper than drones like the U.S. Reaper but also much slower and smaller, with a wingspan of 39 feet. As so often has been the case in this war, however, the experts misjudged the competence of the Russian military. “It’s quite startling to see all these videos of Bayraktars apparently knocking out Russian surface-to-air missile batteries, which are exactly the kind of system that’s equipped to shoot them down,” said David Hambling, a London-based drone expert. That is confounding, Hambling said, because the drones should be easy for the Russians to blow out of the sky — or disable with electronic jamming. “It is literally a World War I aircraft, in terms of performance,” he said. “It’s got a 110-horsepower engine. It is not stealthy. It is not supersonic. It’s a clay pigeon — a real easy target.” If nothing else, the Russians should be able to down the drones with fighter jets, Hambling said. But without air superiority, Russia hasn’t been flying regular combat air patrols. As for electronic jamming, one of the mysteries of the Ukraine invasion is why the Russians haven’t made more use of what experts believe is their advanced electronic warfare capability. The bottom line is that the Turkish drones continue to star in videos shared across Twitter and other social media platforms that feature them blowing Russian vehicles to smithereens. Ukrainians have even praised them in song. It’s unclear how many have been shot down, but some, at least, remain effective, U.S. officials said. “It is puzzling,” Hambling said. “It may be massive incompetence by the Russians. It may be that the Ukrainians have discovered some sneaky tactics they can use.” It’s hardly the first time the Bayraktar has played an important role in an armed conflict. Azerbaijan used small Turkish-made drones to devastating effect against the Armenian military in 2020, bringing a decisive end to a stalemate over a disputed enclave that had gone on for years. Video released by Azerbaijan shows the drones pummeling artillery, tank and troop emplacements surrounded by trenches that offered no protection whatsoever from the fiery death raining down from above. The Turkish drones also had a significant impact in battles against Russian-made military gear in Libya and Syria. The drones are manufactured by Baykar Technology, whose chief technology officer, Selçuk Bayraktar, is a son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “I’m sure it’s going to be selling extremely well,” Hambling said. Many experts have argued that another type of unmanned weapons system would be even more helpful to Ukrainian forces: a so-called kamikaze drone, a vehicle packed with explosives that is essentially a smart guided missile launched miles away from a target. Two Israeli companies make versions of those drones, the Harop and the Hero. The U.S. military fields a system called the Switchblade, the larger version of which can destroy tanks. That weapon isn’t approved for export except to the U.K. Turkey, which has sought to maintain friendly relations with both Russia and the West, was sanctioned by the U.S. in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defense systems. Erdoğan declined to say Monday whether Turkey would buy more Russian weapons. “Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows right now,” he said Monday during a visit to Germany, according to Reuters. “We have to see what the conditions bring. We have to maintain our friendship with Mr. Zelenskyy and Mr. Putin.”",World/NBC News,"Why are Ukraine’s cheap, slow drones so successful against Russian targets?",https://news.yahoo.com/why-ukraine-cheap-slow-drones-205933257.html

3/16/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia on Monday temporarily banned grain exports to ex-Soviet countries and most sugar exports, but a senior minister said it would keep on providing special export licences to traders within its current quota. Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter with Egypt and Turkey among the main buyers. It competes mainly with the European Union and Ukraine. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Monday signed an order banning the export of white and raw sugar until Aug. 31, and banning wheat, rye, barley and maize exports to neighbouring Eurasian Economic Union states until June 30. Deputy Prime Minister Viktoria Abramchenko, however, said the export of grain within the quota under individual licences would continue to be allowed. Moscow last week voiced concern about the quick pace of its grain exports to neighbouring ex-Soviet countries, with which it shares free customs zones under the Eurasian Economic Union. Supplies to the union are not subject to Russia's grain export quotas and current taxes. The measures were adopted ""to protect the domestic food market in the face of external constraints,"" the government statement said. European wheat prices rose on Monday after Interfax news agency reported on Russia's bank on grain exports. It did not initially mention the exclusions from the ban. The government made no mention of the export licenses in its statement either, but said that international transit of grain via the Union would be allowed. Russian wheat exports are down by 45% since the start of the current July-June marketing season because of a smaller crop, grain export taxes, and the export quota set at 11 million tonnes of grain, including 8 million tonnes of wheat, for Feb. 15-June 30. The country still has 6 million to 6.5 million tonnes of wheat to export until June 30, Dmitry Rylko, head of the IKAR agriculture consultancy, said.
