4/4/2022,"Strange Meeting It seemed that out of battle I escapedDown some profound dull tunnel, long since scoopedThrough granites which titanic wars had groined. Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and staredWith piteous recognition in fixed eyes,Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless.And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,—By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell. With a thousand fears that vision’s face was grained;Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.“Strange friend,” I said, “here is no cause to mourn.”“None,” said that other, “save the undone years,The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,Was my life also; I went hunting wildAfter the wildest beauty in the world,Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,But mocks the steady running of the hour,And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.For by my glee might many men have laughed,And of my weeping something had been left,Which must die now. I mean the truth untold,The pity of war, the pity war distilled.Now men will go content with what we spoiled.Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress.None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.Courage was mine, and I had mystery;Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery:To miss the march of this retreating worldInto vain citadels that are not walled.Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels,I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.I would have poured my spirit without stintBut not through wounds; not on the cess of war.Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were. “I am the enemy you killed, my friend.I knew you in this dark: for so you frownedYesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.Let us sleep now …” The literary precursors of Wilfred Owen’s Strange Meeting (1918) have been widely investigated. Dante and Shelley are two of the most readily identifiable. The contrasted registers seem, interestingly and awkwardly, to conduct their own battle for the poem. The tunnel in which Owen’s protagonist finds himself in the opening stanza leads him into a groaning dormitory he recognises as hell. The expansive pace and perspective of these opening lines aren’t unworthy of Dante. The imagery – the “groined” tunnel and the hell-hall of sleepers and stalled hope, are thoroughly, physically present, and at the same time, symbolically dense: they seem to evoke the ossified body and mind of war itself. The big, graceless para-rhymes, though hardly Dantean, are magnificently deployed. Owen’s speaker is not an intentional spiritual pilgrim, but a puzzled young soldier, either dying or dead. His encounter with the soldier from the enemy “side” brings about a beautifully understated reconciliation. “I am the enemy you killed, my friend,” this other soldier says, and his brief explanation is all that’s needed for their truce. This same soldier speaks at length before revealing his identity. It’s as if he represented the poet’s voice, proclaiming both the vision and the bitter understanding (and foresight?) that the vision can never be fulfilled. His language is pitched high – sometimes too high. Enter the Romantic poets with Shelley. Owen’s title, and some trace elements of the story, derive from Shelley’s epic romance, The Revolt of Islam. In the relevant passage, the narrator recovers from unconsciousness caused by blood loss. “And one whose spear had pierced me, leaned beside / With quivering lips and humid eyes; and all / Seemed like some brothers on a journey wide / Gone forth, whom now strange meeting did befall / In a strange land, round one whom they might call / Their friend, their chief, their father, for assay / Of peril, which had saved them from the thrall / Of death, now suffering. Thus the vast array / Of those fraternal bands were reconciled that day.” One of the contributors to a discussion in the journal Connotations argues that the lines beginning “Now men will go content” fail to make sense. Those lines are certainly a shock to the reader’s expectations. The vision of compassionate power – perhaps the power of the poet to tell the truths of war to a world in moral retreat – becomes increasingly messianic. In the last stanza, the earlier, more measured voice returns and is again compelling. It’s been argued that the poem is unfinished. Owen would surely have preserved the finely, purposefully unfinished last line, but it’s possible he would have made clarifications elsewhere if he’d had time to prepare the poem for publication. Richly influenced by earlier poets, has Strange Meeting been influential in its turn? Dylan Thomas admired Owen (“[a] poet of all times, all places, and all wars”) and I believe Strange Meeting may bear fruit in the great villanelle, Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Although not a “war poem”, its allegories of vividly disappointed ambition include, for example, “Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight / And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way” – recalling Owen’s lines “I went hunting wild / After the wildest beauty in the world”. The commandment of the second refrain line (“Rage, rage against the dying of the light”) could almost be the reversal of Owen’s “Let us sleep now …” Flawed though it may be, Strange Meeting resonates beyond its maker’s brief life, and one of its resurrections is the flawless poem by Thomas. There are words and visions that never sleep.

4/4/2022,"Officials being fined for lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street is “not the most important issue in the world” given atrocities in Ukraine, Jacob Rees-Mogg has said, while also arguing that Boris Johnson did not mislead people over the events. Defending earlier comments that described revelations about the parties as “fluff”, the Brexit opportunities minister said a more fundamental issue to be discussed was whether the Covid rules in place at the time were too rigid. Taking part in a phone-in show on LBC radio, Rees-Mogg declined a caller’s request to apologise for calling the party claims “fluff” now that the Metropolitan police had issued fines to some people who attended the lockdown gatherings. “We have a war going on in Ukraine, we have atrocities being carried out, we have pictures coming through that show the enormous brutality of Putin’s army,” Rees-Mogg said. “And what I was saying was, in the context of what is going on, not just with Ukraine but with the cost of living crisis, this is not the most important issue in the world. Having said that, people should obviously obey the law.” Those fined reportedly include the government’s former ethics chief Helen MacNamara. According to the Telegraph, she was fined £50 for attending a leaving event in the Cabinet Office in June 2020. Separately, sources told the Guardian that Downing Street staff have been issued with fines by over a party that took place the night before Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021. Even though fines had been issued, Johnson had not misled parliament when he said no rules were broken, as he was simply passing on information he had been given, Rees-Mogg said. “The fact that the prime minister was given wrong information doesn’t mean he misled people. The prime minister said that he was told that the rules were followed, but that turns out not to be correct. We know that fines have now been issued. But the prime minister can only work on the information he’s given. “If the prime minister is told information that is incorrect, and passes that information on, he has made no deliberate effort to mislead anybody.” Calling his earlier comments “completely reasonable”, Rees-Mogg appeared to suggest a more important issue would be for a future Covid inquiry to look into whether the rules imposed on people’s lives were overly tough. “I don’t think the issue of what may or may not have happened in Downing Street, and what we are finding out, is fundamental,” he said. “What I think is fundamental is that we look in the inquiry at how the rules were devised, and the effect that they had.” Asked about the fines on Sky News, the Wales secretary, Simon Hart, dismissed calls for Boris Johnson to resign, saying “the world has moved on a considerable distance”. Citing the views of his constituents, Hart said: “Throughout all of this saga of the Downing Street parties they have said one thing very clearly, and in a vast majority: they want contrition, they want an apology, but they don’t want a resignation.”",News/Politics,"No 10 lockdown fines ‘not most important issue’, says Rees-Mogg",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/04/no-10-lockdown-fines-not-most-important-issue-jacob-rees-mogg
4/4/2022,"At 5.20pm on Tuesday 4 April 1972, a man with shiny black hair said: “Hello,” and made television history. Small confession: no recording of that first edition of Newsround exists, so I don’t know for sure that he said hello, but thereafter he always began: “Hello again,” so it is more conjecture than a wild guess. The television history part is a fact. Fifty years on, with children asking questions about war and their need for a trustworthy, sensitive source of news, Newsround is more important than ever. It played a big part in my own childhood. In those days – the 70s – you came back from school and put the telly on. John Craven – the man with the shiny hair, as well as a nice line in 70s shirts and, later, offensively brightly coloured jumpers – told us what was going on in the cold war and Northern Ireland, as well as a lot of brighter news stories, generally involving animals. (The debut episode included a report about ospreys returning to Scotland.) “He is clearly one of the most influential journalists of the last 50 years,” says Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Channel 4’s lead newsreader. “And strangely unsung. When you think of the names thrown around over the past half-century, Craven is up there with David Dimbleby.” John Craven’s Newsround, as it was called then, featured in Guru-Murthy’s childhood, too. He used to come home from school in Blackburn and settle down to Newsround with a cup of tea and a crumpet. He didn’t know then that, a decade or so later, from 1991 to 1994, he would be on the other side of the screen, reporting and presenting for the show. Newsround was one of the world’s first TV news magazines made specifically for children. It was commissioned as a short series by the BBC’s Children’s department, but using BBC News facilities. It began life with a handful of staff and a couple of typewriters. (I always thought the percussive original opening theme sounded like a report being bashed out on a typewriter.) Craven – now 81, hair less black and shiny, but still very much around on Countryfile – was the main man for 17 years, until 1989. In those days before the internet and 24-hour rolling news, Newsround would sometimes be the first opportunity for the BBC to put out a big story. The news of the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981 and the loss of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 were broken on the programme. Post-Craven, Newsround became a stepping stone to more grown-up careers. Helen Rollason (Grandstand’s first female presenter) and Julie Etchingham (now an anchor on ITV News at Ten) did stints. Guru-Murthy covered the breakups of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia while still at university. “It was an incredible time to be learning about journalism,” he says. “There were so many geopolitical events. We didn’t shy away from any story; we assumed that children were interested in everything. They were very formative experiences, trying to explain complex events to a young audience in a way that would really bring it home to them.” It was brilliant training, he says. “I constantly find myself going: do I need to explain this, do a bit of background; should we have a map?” He is talking to me from his home, but he is heading to Ukraine any minute now. Behind him, on a big screen, CNN is showing scenes of the war. It has also helped him stockpile a commodity that is invaluable in the delivery of news: trust. When Channel 4 News did some audience research a few years ago, “the viewers were saying: ‘We trust Krishnan because we have grown up with him, watching him on Newsround.’” Lizo Mzimba, who presented from 1998 to 2008 and is now the BBC’s entertainment correspondent, has joined our video call. He has a healthy trust fund, too. “It’s really useful having people who have watched you [when they were kids]. Occasionally, you bump into somebody on the red carpet and they say: “God, I used to love watching you on Newsround.’ It helps break the ice a bit. They’re less on their guard – it’s that guy I used to watch on Newsround, I know him, I trust him. You get a better relationship with them and better answers.” Guru-Murthy and Mzimba say Newsround taught them to use short sentences and simple words wherever possible. Mzimba covered floods in Mozambique, Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 for the show, but he also has fond memories of some of the less serious things, such as a piece about triathlons that had him signing off in a swimming pool, wearing a big pair of orange armbands: “Lizo Mzimba, Newsround, doing the doggy paddle.” It wasn’t all collapsing regimes for Guru-Murthy, either. During his time, they did a mock general election for kids. He also went on the road with Take That, for a piece about fan mania. The sillier stuff hadn’t been part of the career plan. “I wanted to head towards my broadcasting heroes. I never imagined I would be sitting in the cupboard with Edd the Duck, but it was great fun.” Newsround also set the agenda. “It was pushing environmental news long before adult news was,” says Guru-Murthy. “Kids were interested in the world, in animals, the environment, in saving the planet. We were making programmes about that agenda because that’s where kids were already. It’s not about adults deciding what children should be interested in; this was the BBC meeting a need that was out there already.” It led the way on diversity, too. “The makers of Newsround were much more aware of the need to reflect the audience, for kids to see people who look like them, and that also meant bringing in younger presenters,” says Guru-Murthy, mentioning Lucy Mathen (who now runs the Indian blindness charity Second Sight) and Terry Baddoo (now a writer-producer at USA Today), who preceded him. Mzimba says: “As a young black boy living in the UK, I was particularly aware of people like Trevor McDonald and Moira Stuart. Then later figures on Newsround, like Terry Baddoo and Krishnan, of course. In a way, it was more subconscious than conscious, but they were all really key figures in making me think that perhaps this was the kind of job I could do in the future, so I will be eternally grateful to them for they path they trod.” In production and sets, too, Newsround was ahead of the curve, says Guru-Murthy – even back in the Craven days. “He understood that the way to make a presenter more friendly was to bring them out in front of the desk,” he says. “People standing up, moving around the studio, things like that.” Now, all the newsreaders do it. The way people – children included – get their news has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. In 2002, Newsround moved to the new channel CBBC, expanding from a single programme on weekday afternoons to bulletins throughout the day, seven days a week. “We were lucky when we did Newsround and the main activity after school was watching television, so CBBC had a huge grip on children’s time and attention,” says Mzimba. “With the internet and social media, it’s a challenge to get younger people more engaged, because they don’t come to traditional news programmes in the way they used to.” “It is frustrating that kids don’t have the same tradition of watching TV news,” says Guru-Murthy. “But that’s just a challenge of the world today. We’ve got to take it on, wise up to it, and we are doing.” On the day I am speaking to the two former presenters, one of the current presenters, De’Graft Mensah, leads the morning bulletin with a piece about World Book Day. This may not be news in the traditional sense, but is justifiable, says Guru-Murthy. “As a parent, I know it’s hugely significant – it’s what kids are talking about that day – so in terms of their world it’s the big story.” Then there is a report from Ukraine about refugees, especially children, on the border with Poland. This leads nicely into a feature by Marianna Spring, the BBC’s specialist disinformation reporter, about misleading news and how to spot it. Doing a story such as Ukraine for children is not that different from doing any kind of story, says Guru-Murthy. “You try to explain as much of the history – the Soviet Union and Putin – as you can, briefly and concisely. And you have to show quite a lot of the imagery, certainly the bangs and the disruption, but you would be very careful about the amount of distressing footage of people, especially of children.” There is a duty of care to the viewer, he says. While his target audience was eight to 12, there might have been younger children watching; their parents had the right to put them in front of it and for them not to be distressed by the content. “That didn’t mean you couldn’t tackle very serious news or would have to sanitise; we would just explain and contextualise, not scare anyone. It’s the opposite of a lot of news now, especially on the internet, which is driven towards hyping and trying to get clicks.” In July 2020, the 4pm programme was axed, with the focus moving to the 7.45am edition, BBC iPlayer and a website of explainers and features, including Happy News (maintaining a Newsround tradition of covering good news as well as bad). The BBC estimates that 2 million children watch the show at least once a week in schools, while the website attracts 750,000 unique browsers a week. Since the invasion of Ukraine, viewership of the online bulletin has increased by 25%. So: another 50 years, then? Of course, they both say yes, that you only have to look at the world to see the need for Newsround. That “might not be on television, but it will be in the media they are consuming in 50 years’ time,” says Guru-Murthy. Although he is no longer with the BBC, he gets in a dig at those who bash it. “Just look at what the BBC is doing in Ukraine and Russia. I look forward to seeing what Netflix, Amazon and Apple are doing in comparison. When you’ve got a real war, cultural war is put into sharp perspective.” My own kids have grown up with Newsround, just in school rather than after it. Their mum is a primary school teacher, one of the 75% of them who use Newsround as a teaching tool. She asked the six- and seven-year-olds in her year 2 class if they had any questions for the former presenters. They did. Why does Newsround exist? Krishnan Guru-Murthy: To explain what is going on in the world in a way that is clear, with facts you can trust. Lizo Mzimba: Because there is a demand for it. Children are interested in news; they deserve to get it in a way that is specifically tailored to their interests and the way they absorb information. Where do you find the news? KGM: Most of the time, it comes from us finding things out from our journalists around the world, asking people what is going on and then telling you about it. Is it all true? LM: Newsround works really hard to make sure what it says is accurate and in the correct context. KGM: We tried very hard to get it right – harder than most adult news programmes. Is it dangerous? KGM: Sadly, a lot of children live in dangerous places. To tell you about their lives and to explain what’s going on, you sometimes have to go to dangerous places, but you try very hard not to put yourselves at risk in the process. What did you learn from doing it? LM: When you’re gathering information in order to put out a programme like Newsround, you have to understand things yourself before you can explain it to somebody else. So it’s a wonderful way to learn about the world we live in – all the issues that affect people of all ages.",Arts/Television & radio,‘Kids are interested in everything’: Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Lizo Mzimba on Newsround at 50,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/04/krishnan-guru-murthy-lizo-mzimba-newsround-50
4/4/2022,"Two people have died and two others are fighting for life after a landslide on a walking track in the Blue Mountains, about 100km from Sydney. Emergency services were called about 1.30pm after reports of the accident involving a group of five walkers on a track near Wentworth Falls. NSW police acting superintendent John Nelson said a man and a boy died at the scene of the accident. A woman and a boy were in a critical condition, and a girl was walking out from the site with the assistance of authorities, he said. Nelson described the accident as tragic and said the girl was extremely distressed. NSW ambulance acting chief superintendent Stewart Clarke said the two critically injured patients had suffered significant head and abdominal injuries. They would be sedated and intubated before being winched to a helicopter and flown to hospital, he said. The scene that had confronted paramedics was “exceptionally confronting and heartbreaking”, he said, especially as it involved children. The girl had been uninjured but would be assessed again by paramedics and offered pastoral care once she returned to Wentworth Falls. “This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out,” Clarke said. “It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event. “This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.” Nelson said the site was incredibly dangerous and unstable after the accident but conditions in general had been favourable for walking on Monday and the track had been open, despite recent flooding in the area. “Obviously there’s been a major weather event – I can’t comment on the condition of this walking track.” Nelson said the ages of those involved in the accident, and whether or not they were locals, had not been confirmed.",News/Australia news,"Two dead, two critical after landslide in Blue Mountains",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/two-dead-two-critical-after-landslide-in-blue-mountains
4/4/2022,"“Weak leadership” of Australia’s SAS “let down” Ben Roberts-Smith and members of his patrol by failing to investigate allegations of war crimes and allowing the rumours to circulate publicly, the federal court has heard. A former SAS corporal, anonymised before the court as Person 31, told the court in evidence on Monday he was concerned enough by allegations he heard from Robert-Smith’s own patrol members that he confronted the Victoria Cross winner about them. Person 31 was subpoenaed to give evidence in court by three newspapers defending a defamation action brought by Roberts-Smith, his former comrade and Victoria Cross recipient. Roberts-Smith alleges the newspapers’ reports portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 31 told the court he was told that one of Roberts-Smith’s patrol mates had watched Roberts-Smith kick an unarmed Afghan prisoner off a cliff in the village of Darwan in 2012, he said. Further allegations “came to light”, Person 31 said, as he neared his retirement from the military in 2014. Person 31 said he believed SAS command failed its soldiers. “I felt the system let down the members of his patrol and Mr Roberts-Smith himself,” Person 31 told the court. “Those accusations that were brought out of the patrol should have been dealt with in the command. “It wasn’t, I understand, due to weak leadership at the time. Hence we’re now dealing with this in court where no one wants to be.” Earlier evidence in this trial has heard that SAS senior command were alerted to war crimes allegations as early as 2013, but that soldiers believed no action was taken. Person 31 said he was involved in a training drill at Lancelin base in Western Australia in 2012, where SAS soldiers rehearsed “clearing” Afghan-style compounds. Last week, another soldier known as Person 10 gave evidence Roberts-Smith ordered him to carry out a mock execution of a prisoner, actually another soldier, Person 9, acting in the role of a detained Afghan “person under control”. Person 9 was kneeling, facing a wall, when Person 10 said he was called into a rear room of the compound. Person 10 said Roberts-Smith gave him an order. “He said words to the effect of ‘shoot him’.” “But it’s Person 9,” Person 10 told the court her replied. Person 10 said Roberts-Smith reaffirmed the order: “Shoot him.” “I went ‘bang bang’.” Roberts-Smith allegedly said to Person 10: “That’s how it’s going to be on the day.” Person 31 said he climbed on to a shipping container towards the end of the drill, enabling him to look down into the compound – which did not have a roof – when he saw Roberts-Smith, Person 9 and Person 10 in the compound. Person 31 said he did not see or hear the mock execution. But he said the alleged mock execution was “spoken of” within the regiment and that he was concerned enough by the allegation to raise it directly with Roberts-Smith. “I recall walking past Mr Roberts-Smith outside the mess accommodation … we had a quick chat,” he said. Person 31 said he had told Roberts-Smith: “Fuck … pull your head in, you can’t be doing that shit. “I recall him looking down, grunting, nodding and walking off.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Roberts-Smith has consistently denied ever harming any prisoners. He said he never kicked a prisoner off a cliff at Darwan, and that the slain man alleged to have been kicked was an enemy “spotter” who was discovered hiding in a cornfield and lawfully killed within the military’s rules of engagement. “There was no cliff … there was no kick,” he told the court during his evidence. Roberts-Smith was also asked whether the mock execution happened at Lancelin. “No, it didn’t,” he said. “It’s just a ludicrous scenario. I don’t even know how someone would come up with that, quite frankly. It’s just a stupid thing for someone to have said.” In 2014, a letter written by soldiers and circulated around the SAS regiment sought to contest the commendation for distinguished service awarded to Roberts-Smith for his 2012 service. The letter, which was referenced in court Monday, raised at least 26 points of concern about Roberts-Smith’s behaviour on deployment and actions on mission. Person 31 declined to sign the letter, saying he did not feel comfortable putting his name to it.

4/4/2022,"The gangster saga went out in a blaze of Brummie glory and with more twists than Spaghetti Junction. Here’s your postmortem on the feature-length finale, Lock & Key … “One of you will die. Which I cannot tell.” This barrelling episode began with vengeful Michael Gray (Finn Cole) finally getting out of jail, where he’d been simmering all series after being set up by Tommy (Cillian Murphy). His intentions to kill his cousin had been stated all series. Now moustachioed Mikey (don’t call him that) put his plan into action. Tommy flew (how new-fangled) to the smugglers’ haven of Miquelon Island to collect the $5m payment for his opium shipment. Michael placed a briefcase bomb in his car. Well, his mother, Polly, (flashbacks of the mighty Helen McCrory) foresaw that Tommy wouldn’t be killed by a bullet. When Michael made his excuses to leave the motor, there was a window-shattering kaboom. Except it was the car behind, full of Boston mobsters, which blew to smithereens. Cue cheers from sofas as good ole Johnny Dogs (Packy Lee) popped up to tell Tommy: “I switched the ticker like you said, Tom.” Always one step ahead. Getting a bullet through the eye for his trouble, Michael went to meet his maker and his mother. “You are cursed, Tommy,” wept his wife Lizzie (Natasha O’Keeffe). With their daughter Ruby dead, there’s an argument to say that Tommy didn’t need her any more. Young Charles, remember, is the son of Tommy’s late first wife Grace. He’d grown increasingly distant, not even telling her about his terminal tumour. The final straw was sleeping with the enemy, Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson). Yet it was heartbreaking when Lizzie removed her rings, packed her bags and walked out. Charles (Billy Jenkins) opted to go with her, pointing out “you’re more my mum than he is my dad”. Oof. “Look after your mother and tell her I’m sorry,” said Tommy. You deserve better, Lizzie. After a series on the periphery and on heroin, big brother Arthur (Paul Anderson) got clean, aided by the return of his wife Linda (Kate Phillips). After a touching scene of brokenhearted brotherly love with Tommy, he had work to do. The South Boston mob dispatched the IRA to assassinate him at the Garrison. But they were expected. Charlie Strong (Ned Dennehy) acted as a decoy, luring Laura “Captain Swing” McKee (Charlene McKenna) and her soldiers into a trap. In a slowburn shootout reminiscent of Battleship Potemkin’s Odessa Steps sequence, complete with crying baby, the IRA trio played cat-and-mouse with Arthur, Charlie and Jeremiah Jesus (Benjamin Zephaniah). The coup de grâce was “an old keepsake from Passchendaele”. The Peakys released mustard gas into the mist-shrouded alley and emerged in gas masks to gun down their opponents. Arthur gave McKee a gulp of filtered air to ensure she was conscious when he extracted payback for Aunt Polly. “Vengeance is for the Lord,” she gasped, to which he replied: “Not in Small Heath it ain’t. Rest in peace, Poll.” Welcome back, Arthur. We’ve missed you. “Can you keep a secret?” Charlie asked Tommy’s illegitimate son, Erasmus “Duke” Shelby (Conrad Khan). The fact that he was showing the young buck around the gang’s well-stocked armoury gave a clue what was to come. Too many bad memories and a desire to burn down his ill-gotten gains meant Tommy wanted his country pile Arrow House emptied, razed to the ground and replaced by social housing. He dispatched a crew led by Isiah Jesus (Daryl McCormack) to drink the wine cellar dry, dig up the bodies buried in the grounds and send them to “Mr Patches to put in the furnace” (this unseen figure is surely a spin-off show waiting to happen). By candlelight, the “gardeners” arrived. Except Tommy had deduced that Billy Grade (Emmett J Scanlan) was the “black cat” traitor and that youngest brother Finn (Harry Kirton) was equally untrustworthy. No wonder he’d been sidelined. Duke executed Billy and banished Finn from the family. A feud for the future. We last saw Duke, now with proper Peaky haircut, having instructions whispered in his ear by Tommy. Like a frontman introducing the band, writer Steven Knight ensured this legacy tour gave much-loved characters their moment in the spotlight. Not only did “Uncle” Charlie come good. So did Johnny Dogs and Isiah. Fan favourite Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy) arrived for one last spot of scenery-chewing, announcing himself with “I smell the smell of roasting Irishmen”. It turned out to be the mumbling Jewish mobster who was the only hotel guest on Miquelon Island. In return for Tommy selling his opium to the Solomons gang and giving them Boston supremacy, Alfie signed over Camden Town to Tommy. Dear, dependable Curly (Ian Peck) proved his worth once more and got a Tommy cuddle of gratitude. Arthur raised a toast to late brother John (Joe Cole). Even housekeeper Frances (Pauline Turner) got a seat at the table. The gang’s all here. Thomas Shelby MP’s final appearance in the Commons wasn’t what you’d call conventional. He met Mitford on the famous green leatherette seats, requesting support for his housing bill – while outlining his leverage on an artfully folded paper plane. Mitford “wanted to fuck here, on these benches” but staunch socialist Tommy refused to go over to the Tory side, insisting she cross the floor. Order, order. Mitford’s fiancé Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin) interrupted in the nick of time, handing Tommy an invitation to the couple’s wedding in Berlin – at which the Führer himself would be in attendance. Luckily Tommy had business in Newfoundland. Good riddance, gruesome twosome. Like Nick Cave sings: “He’s a god, he’s a man, he’s a ghost.” In many ways, as Tommy admitted to Arthur, they never came back from the Great War. The siblings have been dead men walking for 15 years. Was Tommy’s brain tumour going to succeed where his human foes failed? Of course not. There’s a feature film to make first. So how was our antihero going to cheat death this time? Tommy took himself off to die in a Gypsy wagon, held a revolver to his head (again) – and had a magical vision of deceased daughter Ruby (Orla McDonagh) telling him: “You’re not even sick. You’ve must live, daddy.” Relighting his campfire, Tommy spotted a picture of Mosley’s wedding in a charred newspaper – and a familiar face among the guests: physician Dr Holford (Aneurin Barnard), alongside the female colleague he’d recommended for a second opinion. Tommy didn’t have inoperable tuberculoma after all. The deadly diagnosis was a fascist ruse. Contrived, certainly. Neither did it explain the seizures. But spine-tingling all the same. As the clock struck 11 for Armistice hour, Tommy spared Holford’s life. “Peace at last,” he murmured. His caravan was set ablaze by Holford’s manservant. He’d be assumed dead and could make a fresh start. He rode off into the sunset a free man – “back where we began: horses and caravans, vagabonds and thieves”. See you on the silver screen, Tom. Many commenters have expressed frustration with the meandering pace of this swansong series. I’ve cut it some slack for having to work around both the pandemic and the tragic loss of McCrory, keeping faith that all would come to fruition. For me, it definitely did. This was a thrumming, electrifying way to sign off. Sure, it didn’t tick every box. Several major characters were under-utilised this series, notably Arthur, Alfie and Ada, her stand-in stint as boss aside. At least Tommy handed her the reins. There was no sign of Winston Churchill or Liverpool Docks union convener Hayden Stagg, meaning Stephen Graham’s role was limited to just two scenes. Neither was there any comeuppance for fascist Boston boss Jack Nelson (James Frecheville) – although we can assume the Jewish mob will put paid to him. Yet any fears that Peaky Blinders might “do a Game of Thrones” were put to bed by a satisfyingly propulsive parting shot. Clocking in at 81 minutes, we’d been promised a mini-movie, a dry run for the forthcoming feature, and that’s what we got. This was part western, part gangster epic and so tense, I barely drew breath for the first hour. Hard to believe it’s nine years since Tommy first clip-clopped down Watery Lane. He ended where he began, alone on horseback. Tommy had “been on a journey from the backstreets to the corridors of power”. Now we Peaky Blinders rest. Me? I’m off to look at the fog. Spoilt for choice in an episode replete with one-liners, many of them from Alfie. But in the face of stiff competition, we enjoyed that mother warning her daughter: “If you get lost in the fog, the Peaky Blinders will get you.” The ultimate Brum bogeymen. We opened with Mozart’s Lacrimosa and left on Lisa O’Neill’s cover of Bob Dylan’s All The Tired Horses. In between, the musical highlight was the debut play of Radiohead side project The Smile’s new single Pana-vision, soundtracking Tommy’s near-suicide. It’s just a slight surprise we didn’t bow out with a blast of Red Right Hand. There’s a gathering storm alright … Tommy started series one on a black steed. He ended series six on a white one. Symbolic. “The BSA factory on Armoury Road” is indeed a Small Heath landmark. Sleaford Mods frontman Jason Williamson was perfect as ranting preacher Lazarus. Bravo to director Anthony Byrne who heroically helmed the show’s last 12 episodes under testing circumstances. He ended on a humdinger, full of operatic crescendoes and handsome cinematography. Let’s raise one last whiskey to Sarah Hughes, much-loved previous custodian of this blog. Her posthumous memoir, Holding Tight, Letting Go, was published last week.

4/4/2022,"The UK’s financial regulators will investigate the London Metal Exchange’s handling of a week-long suspension of trading in nickel amid chaotic conditions at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The LME suspended trading in nickel, a crucial material for electric car batteries, on 8 March after prices doubled over the course of a day to a record $100,000 (£76,200) a tonne. Trading in the metal reopened after a week, on 16 March. The exchange’s regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England (BoE) on Monday said in a joint statement the trading stop had underlined questions previously raised about the structure of the market and “particularly the role of transparency”. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine had raised concerns over the supply of nickel from Russia. The Moscow-headquartered Nornickel is the world’s largest supplier of refined nickel, mined in Siberia. The company is led by Vladimir Potanin, an oligarch who is one of Russia’s richest men. He and his company have not been sanctioned by the US, EU, or UK. Amid the market chaos resulting from the invasion, the LME caused uproar among metals traders by cancelling all transactions made on 8 March, a move it said it needed to make to protect orderly trading and prevent smaller members of the exchange from going bust. The LME on Monday said that the movements in the run-up to its trading suspension were “unprecedented”. It has put a 15% limit on daily market moves in metals for physical delivery, which it said had broad support, and will commission its own independent review of the chaos. It said: “The LME fully recognises the impact of these events on a broad spectrum of market participants, and understands that not all participants agreed with the course of action undertaken. The LME sought to act in the interests of the market as a whole and acknowledges the concerns expressed by some market participants.” The exchange said it had already identified one problem with its lack of visibility of trades that happened outside the exchange – known as “over-the-counter” trades – that helped to drive the price up. The FCA will “review the LME’s approach to managing the suspension and resumption of the market in nickel to determine what lessons might be learned in relation to the LME’s governance and market oversight arrangements”, while the BoE will look at LME Clear, the subsidiary that handles the actual transactions. The FCA made it clear that it LME will have to make changes after the turmoil. It said it “expects the LME to consider carefully how recent events should shape its future approach on market structure”. The regulators will also talk to trading firms to assess their risk management.",News/Business,London Metal Exchange faces review over nickel trading chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/london-metal-exchange-review-nickel-trading-bank-of-england-fca
4/4/2022,"Valeria Ramírez Castañeda, a Colombian biologist, spends her time in the Amazon studying how snakes eat poisonous frogs without getting ill. Although her findings come in many shapes and sizes, in her years as a researcher, she and her colleagues have struggled to get their biological discoveries out to the wider scientific community. With Spanish as her mother tongue, her research had to be translated into English to be published. That wasn’t always possible because of budget or time constraints –and it means that some of her findings were never published. “It’s not that I’m a bad scientist,” she says. “It’s just because of the language.” Ramírez Castañeda is not alone. There is a plethora of research in non-English-language papers that gets lost in translation, or is never translated, creating a gap in the global community’s scientific knowledge. As the amount of scientific research grows, so does the gap. This is especially true for conservation and biodiversity. Research about native traditions and knowledge tied to biodiversity is often conducted in the domestic non-colonial language and isn’t translated. A study published in the journal Plos Biology found that paying more attention to non-English language research could expand the geographical coverage of biodiversity scientific evidence by 12% to 25% and the number of species covered by 5% to 32%. There is research on nine amphibian species, 217 bird species and 64 mammal species not covered in English-language studies. “We are essentially not using scientific evidence published in non-English-languages at the international level, but if we could make a better use of [it], we might be able to fill the existing gaps in the variability of current scientific evidence,” says Tatsuya Amano, a Japanese biodiversity researcher at the University of Queensland and the paper’s lead researcher. His team pored over more than 400,000 peer-reviewed papers in 16 different languages and found 1,234 studies providing evidence on biodiversity conservation which, because they weren’t in English, may have been overlooked. These included Japanese-language findings on the effectiveness of relocating the endangered Blakiston’s fish owl, the largest owl species, and a Spanish-language study on the use of guardian dogs to alleviate conflict between farmers and Andean mountain cats in Patagonia. Although some non-English language studies don’t meet international standards, steps can be taken to help the community overcome language barriers, says Amano, who has published a guide in the journal Science. Some experts believe English should be the lingua franca of science. Scott Montgomery, a geoscientist at the University of Washington and author of Does Science Need a Global Language? argues that for the sake of the bigger picture, scientific knowledge should converge into one common language. “Science is very globalised and becoming more so, so the use of a global language is enormous for that. It’s not just for efficiency, it’s for collaboration,” Montgomery says. “I make the point that learning English should be something similar to learning mathematics for scientists. It’s just a very basic, fundamental skill that you need to participate.” Where that isn’t possible, other languages should be translated into English, he adds. Translating science into a more widely used language has been standard practice in history, according to Michael Gordin, a science historian at Princeton University. “This kind of chain of translations is a thing that’s been going on in the history of science for millennia,” he says. “Arabic knowledge, which was very prominent from about the ninth century to the 13th century, some of it was Persian translated into Arabic, but a lot of it was Greek and Syriac translated into Arabic, and more.” However, the amount of scientific knowledge that needs translating is huge. One potential solution is to extend the use of machine translation, which was initially developed to translate Russian science into English, according to Gordin. Another option would be to have large international scientific organisations subsidise the translation and copy-editing of local science into a universal language. It also could be possible to transition to a world where, say, Chinese, English and Spanish are the three languages of science and scientists were expected to have a passive knowledge of all three, just as English, French and German were the languages of science in the 19th century. It is a problem worth tackling because this language gap also widens the gap between the global north and south, argues Nina Hunter, a researcher at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. “Global south scientists and their science aren’t taken into consideration in the same way, because it’s all just based on the kind of criteria that are easy for the global north,” she says. In a recent paper, she argues that in the fight to combat the climate crisis, researchers from Lusophone Africa (Portuguese-speaking African countries) are being marginalised. Inequality in international influence is also a result of unequal access to knowledge, because of that language gap, according to Hunter. Many biologists from indigenous communities in South America or Africa, who have already had to learn the colonial language of the nation, are cut off from accruing more personal and professional knowledge for their research because so much of it is published solely in a language they don’t understand. Scientists can work with an English collaborator, or use a translator – but this ultimately strengthens the cycle of dependency on the global north, according to Ramírez Castañeda, who is currently a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. After her initial publishing struggles, she went on to study science communication and published an article on the difficulties facing Colombian researchers. The specific meanings of words can also pose a problem in translation, she says. For example, in the work she does with indigenous communities in the Amazon, many of the local languages don’t have one single word to describe forest snakes and frogs. “So we’re losing observations for science, too,” says Ramírez Castañeda. “For me, it’s not possible to just have everything translated to English. We need multilingual science, and we need people that feel comfortable doing science in their own languages.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Lost in translation: is research into species being missed because of a language barrier?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/lost-in-translation-is-research-into-species-being-missed-because-of-a-language-barrier-aoe
4/4/2022,"An increasing number of young children have been left unable to understand facial expressions after having fewer opportunities to develop their social skills during the pandemic, the education watchdog for England has said. Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s chief inspector, said the worst affected were the most vulnerable children, with those living in smaller homes without gardens typically spending more time on screens during successive lockdowns, which also resulted in delays in learning to walk and crawl. She said it was clear from four briefings on education recovery published by Ofsted that the pandemic had created “lingering challenges”. She said: “I’m particularly worried about younger children’s development, which, if left unaddressed, could potentially cause problems for primary schools down the line.” In the briefing on early years, based on inspections of 70 early years’ providers in January and February 2022, some providers say children have “limited vocabulary” while “some babies have struggled to respond to basic facial expressions”, partly due to interacting with people wearing face masks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Spielman said the pandemic and lockdowns had resulted in delays in learning speech and language; problems with social interaction and confidence, such as not knowing how to take turns; as well as delays in walking and crawling, with more obesity as a result.Children were also not at the expected level in developing vital self-care skills, such as being potty trained, tying their shoelaces and taking their coats on and off, she added.She said: “Children have had less time in early education, less time interacting with others outside the family. For some children they’ve not much interaction at all if they’ve spent all their time looking at screens. Children have been talking in the funny voices of cartoons they’ve been spending enormous amounts of time watching.” To assist their child’s development, Spielman advised parents to speak to their children as much as possible, take them out on walks, to the shops and to the park so they could see the world and take exercise. “Those basic parenting things are more important than delaying their entrance to school,” she said. She said schools were well-prepared to deal with children at a range of developmental levels, noting that the most effort would be put into children who have had the worst experiences over the pandemic.The inspectorate has seen “lots of really good work” across early years, schools and further education, including on catchup strategies to close gaps in knowledge and skills.But Ofsted found that funded places for two-year-olds had not been used as much as before the pandemic, which Spielman said she hoped she “will see reversed” as normal life returns.The reports showed that some staff members at nurseries have come up with innovative ways to help young children catch up, such as through a “chatter group” with a diary to record activities, or encouraging children to express their feelings through “emotion cards” with images of children displaying different facial expressions. In schools, Ofsted found the pandemic was continuing to affect pupils’ knowledge, while headteachers also raised particular concerns about children in reception year, who they said had delayed speech and language development.For older secondary pupils in years 11 and 13, teachers are struggling to help pupils catch up on content they had missed while simultaneously preparing them for exams.James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders’ union the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Schools work incredibly hard to give pupils the extra support they need but they cannot do it alone – the government must also invest in early years services for disadvantaged families, as well as vital services like speech and language therapy, so that those children who need specialist support receive it as early as possible.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our ambitious recovery plan continues to roll out across the country, with nearly £5bn invested in high quality tutoring, world class training for teachers and early years practitioners, additional funding for schools, and extending time in colleges by 40 hours a year.“We have simplified the national tutoring programme to reach as many pupils as possible, with funding going directly to schools from next year. The Nuffield early language intervention programme is also being used by the majority of schools to improve language skills of reception-age children.”",News/Society,"Pandemic has delayed social skills of young children, says Ofsted chief",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/pandemic-has-delayed-social-skills-of-young-children-says-ofsted-chief
