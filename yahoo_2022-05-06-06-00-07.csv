5/6/2022,"Paul Murdaugh’s former girlfriend detailed in court papers how the Murdaugh family enabled Paul’s binge drinking while underage, prior to a deadly boat crash in 2019. In a sworn affidavit filed Thursday in Hampton County, Morgan Doughty stated she has first-hand knowledge of how her ex-boyfriend Paul Murdaugh drank excessively, how Murdaugh’s parents funded and allowed him to do so while he was underage, and how Doughty has videos to prove it. The February 2019 boat crash, which killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach and shed the first harsh spotlight on the Murdaugh legal dynasty, prompted a civil lawsuit against the Murdaugh family and Parker’s convenience stores. It’s been over three years since the lawsuit was filed. The Doughty filing comes a day before a Friday hearing in Lexington County on the boat crash case, where jailed patriarch Alex Murdaugh’s attorneys are expected to argue to remove the “receivership” which is controlling and examining Murdaugh’s finances. Alex Murdaugh is incarcerated awaiting trial on charges he stole $8.4 million belonging to clients and colleagues. The boat crash lawsuit accuses the Murdaughs of negligence in enabling Paul Murdaugh’s drinking prior to the boat crash and Parker’s for allowing him to purchase beer using his older brother’s ID. But since then, Paul, 22, and Maggie, 52, Murdaugh were both found shot to death on June 7, 2021 at the family property “Moselle” in Colleton County. Their still-unsolved murders have caused every aspect of the Murdaughs’ lives to be picked apart by police, prosecutors, media and the public. Doughty’s filing further illuminates the behavior that lead up to the fatal boat crash that first brought scrutiny on the Murdaugh family name. Paul Murdaugh, son of Alex Murdaugh, “consumed alcohol on an almost daily basis and regularly drank to the point of becoming grossly intoxicated,” a fact known by his family members, according to Doughty’s affidavit. Murdaugh would regularly drink to the point of drunkenness while in front of his family members, the affidavit said. He drove cars and boats while under the influence, and Murdaugh’s parents gave him money to purchase alcohol, according to the document. In the affidavit, Doughty lists out 22 videos, and screenshots from those videos, that she took prior to the boat crash where Paul Murdaugh was intoxicated with his family or was enabled by his family. They include: ▪ A video taken on July 4, 2018, where Doughty is administering a shot to Murdaugh’s father, Alex Murdaugh. She said Paul Murdaugh was on the boat and also grossly intoxicated. ▪ A video taken on Dec. 31, 2018, where Paul Murdaugh was intoxicated from alcohol provided by his father, the affidavit states. Afterward, “Paul drove Alex’s truck, with Alex’s knowledge, and wrecked into one of his Paul’s friend’s BMWs. Alex paid cash to fix the car after the collision,” the document states. ▪ A video taken in December 2017, where Paul Murdaugh is intoxicated at Moselle, from alcohol he used his brother’s ID to buy and “with his parents’ knowledge,” Doughty said. “Paul’s mother picked us up that night because Paul was so drunk and acting crazy,” the document said. ▪ A video taken in Arizona in 2017, where Paul Murdaugh’s brother, “Buster,” is arm wrestling with Alex’s friend, lawyer Cory Fleming, the affidavit says. Fleming has since faced indictments in the Murdaugh saga and also provided Paul with alcohol that night, the document states. ▪ A video, without a date, taken of a party at Moselle where “Alex provided a keg of beer for a number of minors,” and Buster saw his brother intoxicated. ▪ A video taken at the Boathouse restaurant on Hilton Head Island, where Paul used his brother’s ID to buy alcohol, while Buster used his passport. “Paul’s parents were present and knew and paid the bill for the alcohol,” the affidavit states. ▪ The last two videos came from a wedding in 2018, where Paul had become intoxicated and his parents were there and knew of his condition, the document states. “Alex and Maggie argued on the way home that night because Alex also took a pain killer and became aggressive. We dropped Alex off at his parents’ house on the way home because of his aggressive behavior.” The behavior detailed in the legal filing is consistent with the picture revealed of Paul Murdaugh when he was taken to the hospital following the boat crash that killed Beach on Feb. 24, 2019. He was belligerent, unruly, and appeared intoxicated, according to prior reporting by the Island Packet & Beaufort Gazette newspapers. Why such behavior matters now is because of how police deviated from regular practice when investigating the offense of boating under the influence and how Paul Murdaugh’s father, Alex, attempted to interfere with the police investigation, prior reporting revealed. His actions prompted speculation in the community that the powerful family was attempting to use its influence to cover up for Paul Murdaugh’s actions. Paul Murdaugh came from a long line of lawyers, most of whom controlled the prosecutor’s office for the five-county 14th Judicial Circuit. His father, Alex, formerly a partner of the Hampton law firm his great-grandfather started, found himself the subject of a lawsuit brought by the Beach family after the crash. Paul Murdaugh’s behavior allegedly continued even after he was charged, while his family fought the Beach’s lawsuit. Then Paul Murdaugh was killed. It’s unclear how his prior actions fit into his murder. Police have announced no suspects or motives. Alex Murdaugh has been labeled as a person of interest in the murders of Paul and Maggie. Since then, the patriarch has been on the receiving end of dozens of lawsuits and criminal charges involving financial wrongdoing. But, according to the latest affidavit, it can all be traced back to drinks on a boat and a family that allowed binge drinking to occur.",U.S./Hilton Head Island Packet,Ex-girlfriend says Paul Murdaugh’s parents enabled binge drinking prior to SC boat crash,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-girlfriend-says-paul-murdaugh-195501460.html
5/6/2022,"(Reuters) -The Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV2 virus is intrinsically as severe as previous variants, , according to a preprint version of a large U.S. study https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1601788/v1 that counters assumptions in other studies that it was more transmissible but less severe. The findings, which estimated Omicron's severity after accounting for the impact of vaccines, should reinforce the importance of inoculations and booster shots, experts said. Vaccines helped keep hospitalizations and deaths relatively low during the Omicron surge compared with previous variants. The study, which is undergoing peer review at Nature Portfolio, was posted on Research Square on May 2. The authors, from Massachusetts General Hospital, Minerva University and Harvard Medical School, declined to comment until peer review is completed. ""We found that the risks of hospitalization and mortality were nearly identical"" between the Omicron era and times in the past two years when different variants were dominant, the researchers said in their report. The new study, based on records of 130,000 COVID patients in Massachusetts, is unique and ""pretty strong,"" said Dr. Arjun Venkatesh of Yale School of Medicine and the Yale Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, who was not involved in the research. Rather than just looking at numbers of deaths and hospitalizations, as earlier studies have done, it accounted for patients' vaccination status and medical risk factors and compared similar groups of people, Venkatesh said. The authors cited potential limitations in their report, including the possibility that the analysis underestimated the number of vaccinated patients in more recent COVID waves, and the total number of infections, because it excluded patients who performed at-home rapid tests. The study did not account for treatments patients may have received, such as monoclonal antibodies or antiviral drugs ""that are known to reduce hospitalizations,"" Venkatesh noted. ""It's possible that if we didn't have these treatments available today, Omicron would be even worse."" Countries around the world have found that a significant percentage of their citizens were unwilling to get a COVID vaccine, even during surges of apparently deadlier variants. When the Omicron variant was first identified late in 2021, public health officials said it caused much milder symptoms in the vast majority of infected people. That may have encouraged the vaccine hesitant that they were less in need of a shot. But Venkatesh said the new preprint adds to evidence that vaccines helped spare people from the worst impacts of Omicron. ""Don't make the mistake"" of thinking vaccines and boosters are not important, he said.

5/6/2022,"Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson told a group of COVID vaccine critics that he's in a ""guerrilla war"" as he seeks to empower doctors and reform the medical establishment. In an exchange during a Zoom conference call Sunday that was taped and placed on the website Rumble, Johnson said he ""always advised the doctors that I have been working with don't do anything, don't say anything to marginalize themselves."" ""I need every guerrilla fighting this guerrilla war right now,"" he added. ""Don't get out ahead of what the public is willing to accept as truth."" Subscribe to our On Wisconsin Politics newsletter for the week's political news explained. Johnson, who has raised concerns about COVID vaccines and promoted the use of ivermectin and other unapproved therapies for early treatment of COVID-19, was speaking to a group that called itself Doctors for COVID Ethics. Moderator Charles Kovess, who bills himself as Australia's Passion Provocateur, said about 100 ""doctors, lawyers, scientists, physicists"" were on the call. Johnson has provided a platform for doctors who have been critical of the nation's COVID response. In January, one panel lasted more than five hours. In June in Milwaukee, Johnson assembled a group of people who said they suffered adverse reactions to the vaccine. Patrick Remington, an emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, severely criticized Johnson and called his persistent questioning of medical science irresponsible. ""If he had a medical license these would be grounds for malpractice,"" said Remington, a former epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""But since he's not trained in medicine, he should stay in his lane and focus on things he knows about."" During his remarks Sunday, some of his most unvarnished to date on the subject, Johnson said the way ""we've handled COVID has been a miserable failure,"" and claimed the major reason is that ""no one wants to admit they're wrong."" Among those he criticized were ""Big Pharma, big media, big tech giants,"" and doctors who ""don't want to admit that the vaccine they were pushing on their patients are injuring them, potentially killing them."" He said ""the only hope we have is if enough doctors come forward and admit the vaccine has created these injuries."" ""Really the goal has to be to completely reform our medical establishment,"" Johnson said. ""Doctors should be at the top of the treatment pyramid, right now they're being crushed at the bottom. ""I think partly this is because of our education system that has created a bunch of woke doctors, too, that will not question authority, don't have the courage and compassion to practice medicine. They just follow orders. They're happy to practice protocol, regardless of whether their patients are just dropping dead from lack of treatment or under treatment,"" Remington, who said every profession including medicine, has outliers, took issue with Johnson's comments on vaccines and doctors. ""He doesn't understand medicine is a science and that physicians learn from research and from evidence,"" Remington said. More: Ron Johnson says mouthwash can kill COVID-19. Manufacturer of Listerine, medical experts say there's no evidence yet to prove that. Remington said COVID vaccines ""have been one of the safest if not the safest vaccine that has ever been developed."" He added: ""The vaccine has saved thousands if not millions of lives with a very low rate of complications."" More: Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson uses God in one of multiple attempts at sowing doubt over the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines There was media focus on one exchange during the 1 hour, 17-minute session, when Colorado-based attorney Todd Callender told Johnson that COVID-19 “shots caused vaccine-induced AIDS. They purposefully gave people AIDS."" The attorney also sought to hold people criminally accountable, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, and brought up several conspiracy theories, Johnson did not directly push back at the vaccine falsehood. He responded: ""Let me challenge you there. That’s way down the road. You gotta do one step at a time. Everything you say may be true, OK, but right now the public views the vaccines as largely safe and effective, that vaccine injuries are rare and mild. That’s the narrative, that’s what the vast majority of the public accepts. ""So until we get a larger percentage of the population with their eyes open to 'whoa, these vaccine injuries are real, why?’ You know, it’s gotta be step by step. You can’t leap to crimes against humanity. You can’t leap to another Nuremberg trial.” Late Tuesday, Johnson tweeted, ""I've never stated nor do I believe that the COVID vaccine causes HIV."" Once again, I can’t breathe without my exhalation being distorted by the corporate media  I’ve never stated nor do I believe that the COVID vaccine causes HIV  Even as the media attempts to defame me, I will always fight for transparency and advocate for the vaccine injured https://t.co/j9rKcEOF2T — Senator Ron Johnson (@SenRonJohnson) May 3, 2022 A spokeswoman for Johnson said, ""The senator’s goal is transparency from our federal health agencies, not getting fired if you chose not to get vaccinated, and getting those who have had adverse reactions to the vaccine recognized so they may get treatment. He’s never mentioned Nuremberg, intentional genocide, crimes against humanity, criminal intent, or COVID vaccines causing AIDS."" Our subscribers make this reporting possible.

5/6/2022,"A man accused of assaulting two Korean American sisters at a liquor store in West Baltimore last year has been deemed incompetent to stand trial.

Daryl Doles, 51, was indicted on 22 counts — including attempted murder and hate crime charges — for the violent rampage, during which he allegedly hit the victims with a cement block and attacked two other Asian-owned liquor stores.

The cement block incident, which was caught on surveillance video, occurred at Wonderland Liquor Store in the 2000 block of Pennsylvania Avenue at around 11:45 p.m. on May 2 last year.

The sisters were closing the store when Doles allegedly showed up, kicked a display window and attacked them.

 “They both tried to fight him off, but were unfortunately overpowered,” said John Yun, who identified the victims as his mother and aunt. Yun organized a GoFundMe page that raised $84,229 for their medical expenses.

The Wonderland attack was reportedly Doles’ third target. His rampage allegedly started at Linden Discount Liquors at 904 West North Avenue, where he was refused entry for not wearing a mask, and continued to nearby 40/40 Liquors at 2139 Pennsylvania Avenue.

 

After being barred from Linden Discount, Doles allegedly returned “with a large piece of lumber and attacked the security guard,” according to Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby. Then, at 40/40, he allegedly “kicked a display window, and said ‘f*ck Chinese.’”

Doles appeared before the Baltimore City Circuit Court via Zoom on Wednesday where the judge ruled that him incompetent to stand trial, based on a psychiatric evaluation.

“Based on the opinion of the evaluators at the Department of Health, I find beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant is incompetent to stand trial and dangerous to himself and others,” the judge said, as per WBAL-TV 11. The defense and prosecution were reportedly in agreement.

Doles has been in jail since the time of his arrest hours after the attacks. The latest ruling means he will be committed to a mental health facility instead of facing trial.

5/6/2022,"TISHOMINGO, Okla. (AP) — The teenage driver of a small car that collided with a large truck in Oklahoma, killing all six occupants in the car, tested negative for alcohol but positive for cannabis after her death, according to a preliminary report released Thursday. The teens were on a school lunch break in a Chevrolet Spark that is designed to carry four passengers when the collision happened in March in Tishomingo, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southeast of Oklahoma City. The driver and all five passengers died in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board also said the 16-year-old driver had been issued an intermediate driver's license six months before the crash. Under that license, she was only legally permitted to have one passenger from outside her household unless there was someone who was at least 21 years old in the car. According to the report, the teen driver turned left at a stop sign when her car was struck by an oncoming truck. The truck's driver was not injured and tested negative for alcohol and drugs, the NTSB report said. The six girls who died ranged in age from 15 to 17. Only two of them were wearing seat belts, according to an earlier report from the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.
