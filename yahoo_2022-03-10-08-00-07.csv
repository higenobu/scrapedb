3/10/2022,"Judge William Eichman told 42-year-old Kethan Lee Anderson that he acted as judge, jury and executioner in a case of street justice in which he strangled to death a fellow homeless man who was accused of sexually harassing his friend. Eichman told Anderson he was appalled by his lack of remorse when he spoke with detectives telling them that killing was ""the only significant thing you did in (his) entire life"" ""That's sad,"" the judge said before sending him to prison for 50 years. ""The court believes you are a danger to society."" Anderson, who had no prior felony convictions, faced between five years to life in prison after pleading guilty in October to a count of murder in the June 2018 killing of 51-year-old Richard Bradley Richards, whose skeletal remains were found in November of that year in the backyard of a condemned home in the 2100 block of 20th Street. Eichman told Anderson none of the evidence presented to him showed his actions were justified. ""The victim did not deserve it,"" he said. ""Even if he did what your co-defendant said he did."" Anderson's plea was not the result of a negotiation with the Lubbock County District Attorney's Office. Instead, he entered his plea and opted for Eichman to determine his punishment after a bench trial that began March 1 in the 364th District Court. Anderson, who has been held at the Lubbock County Detention Center since his Dec. 3, 2018 arrest, is one of two people charged with murder in Richards' slaying. Anna Smith is awaiting trial for her role in Richards' murder. Sunshine Stanek, the Lubbock County District Attorney, said the case summed up the problem of vigilante justice and Eichman's judgement was the appropriate response to Anderson's behavior. ""As angry or upset as you may be about a situation, we have to trust law enforcement to take care of those things,"" she said. ""And, that was one of the biggest issues in this case is that he tried to take matters into his own hands and that is not the answer.

3/10/2022,"Extremist Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) was roundly mocked on Monday for her ridiculous stretch trying to spin Russia’s invasion of Ukraine into an attack on gun control. “Remember. Ukraine gave up their nukes in exchange for promises of security,” the conspiracy theorist tweeted, referencing the country’s nuclear disarmament following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. “We see how that turned out,” the Donald Trump-adoring gun lover added. “This is why we must NEVER give up our guns to any government.” Critics thought Boebert’s comparison of firearms with nuclear weapons was just too much: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/10/2022,"(Reuters) - Moscow said on Tuesday that Ukrainian authorities had endorsed only one civilian evacuation route from areas affected by fighting out of 10 that were proposed, including five towards territory controlled by Kyiv, the Interfax news agency reported. The Russian defence ministry said 723 people had been evacuated through the Sumy-Poltava corridor, including 576 Indian nationals, in a first convoy. Ukraine said on Monday that a Russian proposal on humanitarian corridors was ""completely immoral"" after Moscow suggested it would allow people to flee Ukrainian cities towards only Belarus or Russia. Civilians have been trapped by fighting since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, and officials say food, water and other supplies have been running low in some cities. Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, said on Tuesday that Moscow had proposed evacuation corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol - ""one from each city to the Russian Federation, as well as one each through the territories controlled by the Kyiv authorities to Poland, Moldova, Romania"". Ukrainian civilians did begin leaving the northeastern city of Sumy and the town of Irpin near Kyiv, heading towards the Ukrainian city of Poltava, but Ukraine said Russian forces had shelled another evacuation route - from the port city of Mariupol. The Russian defence ministry said earlier that Russian forces had introduced a ""silent regime"" along the evacuation corridors from 0700 GMT, Interfax reported.
