2/7/2022,"Sajid Javid has begun a rather dramatic U-turn. Until recently, the health secretary insisted that care workers and frontline NHS staff had to get vaccinated against Covid or find another post, but the policy has now been dropped. Compulsory vaccination is still good health policy, he told fellow MPs, but ministers worry about a plunge in staff numbers. Yet there is a policy that public health officials, doctors and trade unionists have been calling for since the start of the pandemic, and that would not infringe on civil liberties or dent staff numbers: introducing a proper sick pay system. Doing that would reduce the spread of infectious diseases, ease the cost-of-living crisis for the working poor during this pandemic, and be a small step towards a fairer country. The UK’s statutory sick pay system is in terrible health. The previous health secretary, Matt Hancock, admitted that he couldn’t live on what it pays, currently £96.35 a week. No surprise there: it is among the lowest sick pay in the industrialised world.  Even worse, about 2 million workers do not earn enough to qualify for it, a fact that troubled the government enough to consult on whether to make the regime more generous. Three out of four employers who responded agreed that statutory sick pay should be extended, and small businesses were as supportive as large. Despite such hearty enthusiasm, the welfare secretary, Thérèse Coffey, long-grassed any idea of reform. The motive is probably the same as that behind last autumn’s withdrawal of the £20 boost to universal credit: the government does not want any of its pandemic-era “giveaways” to become permanent. For all that ministers pretend spending cuts are over, this remains a very austere government. The UK is thus running a huge risk to public health. If waiters think they are coming down with Covid but know they are not eligible for any sick pay, they have every incentive to go to work and cough and splutter over colleagues and customers alike. If care workers suspect they are seriously ill but worry that £96 a week will leave them behind on rent and bills, they have a choice: fall into debt or risk patients getting ill – with potentially serious consequences. These are terrible choices, yet ministers force them on low-paid workers every single day. About 8 million workers – more than a quarter of the labour force – face penury just for falling ill. So much for clapping for carers. What’s also unfair about this system is who it affects. New research from the IPPR thinktank shows that those people denied sick pay tend to be older or from an ethnic minority and it argues that this reeks of “age and race-based discrimination”. A healthier sick pay regime would allow anyone to claim it, regardless of low earnings. It would vastly increase mandatory pay and allow workers to claim from day one of their illness. When, in spring 2020, Rishi Sunak announced his measures to prop up the economy and slow the spread of coronavirus, he said: “We’re all in this together.” It was a generous phrase that soon rang hollow, as more and more low-paid workers fell ill just by doing their often essential jobs. The chancellor has had nearly two years to fix the sick pay system. If not now, when?",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on sick pay: a system unfit for purpose | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-sick-pay-a-system-unfit-for-purpose
2/7/2022,"Twenty five miles, 18 places and one division may separate Nottingham Forest from Leicester City but ultimately it was the crazy seconds in the first half that exemplified the difference between these East Midlands rivals. That was the time between goals from Philip Zinckernagel and Brennan Johnson as Forest, from the Championship, deservedly knocked out FA Cup winners for the second round in succession to land a fifth-round tie at home to Huddersfield Town.  The FA has confirmed it will investigate the unsavoury scenes that followed Joe Worrall’s goal nine minutes later as a Leicester fan found his way on to the pitch and took two punches at the celebrating Forest players before stewards took him to ground. It is eight years since these teams last met but, with some of the form Forest are producing under Steve Cooper, it is not inconceivable the next time they will meet will be in the Premier League. Brendan Rodgers has talked about changing his squad around this summer but Leicester, without an away win in seven games, need to do something about reviving this season before this rot goes any deeper. They were not just beaten here; they were humiliated. The pivotal spell of three goals in nine minutes simply took the breath away as Leicester were blown away. When Nottingham Forest have been good this season they have been very good – and when Leicester are bad they have been very bad – but this was something else. Only Fulham can better Forest’s record in the Championship since Steve Cooper took charge in September and the confidence he has instilled was clear to see, especially after Keinan Davis had chested down Brennan Johnson’s lofted pass back into the area and volleyed, left-footed, against the angle of post and bar. It was not that Leicester were taking this lightly. Indeed, although they had made three changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Brighton a fortnight ago, the returns of Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho, after the African Cup of Nations, ostensibly strengthened the side. That was in theory anyway. Forest had won four games on the trot before having an off-day at Cardiff last Sunday just as a place in the play-offs beckoned. But here they were just unplayable for the crucial period that ultimately allowed them to win this game. Leicester were undone somewhat easily for the opening goal. After good work from Djed Spence down the right wing, there was too much space for Brennan Johnson when the ball was played back to him and when his cross was winched in to the back post, Davis outmuscled James Justin to nod the ball down for Philip Zinckernagel to sidefoot the ball home. The BBC were still showing replays of that goal 24 seconds later when Johnson made it 2-0 after Daniel Amartey played a blind back pass towards Danny Ward in the Leicester goal. The pacey young forward, for whom Forest rejected a £20m bid from Brentford last month, showed fine composure to slot the ball wide of the keeper’s legs. Ryan Yates should have headed in and Zinckernagel had a shot deflected wide as Forest smelled blood; some of the first-time pass-and-move from Cooper’s team was exhilarating, not least in the move that led to the corner for the third goal. James Garner’s flag kick was headed in by captain Joe Worrall, back from injury, who celebrated injudiciously if understandably in front of the 4,000 Leicester fans. One fan got on to the pitch and threw two punches at Forest’s jubilant players as Yates, Johnson and Davis pushed him back before stewards took control of the situation. Ward saved well from Spence, whose future after this loan from Middlesbrough seems likely to be in the Premier League, and when Leicester pulled a goal back five minutes before half-time, there was a sense of the tie being back in the balance. Quite why the eccentric Brice Samba needed to come sprinting from his goal to cover James Maddison’s channel ball only he will know but the goalkeeper’s poor judgment did not stretch to taking out Iheanacho, who touched the ball past him and also Scott McKenna before drilling in from a difficult angle. Brendan Rodgers went for two up front at the start of the second half, Patson Daka replacing Harvey Barnes. The substitute, fed by Iheanacho, shot over and Ademola Lookman had a shout for a penalty when tackled on the edge of the area before the result was sealed on the hour mark. Spence, superb all afternoon, cut inside from wide on the right and kept running after playing the ball in to Zinckernagel whose return pass cut out the creaking Leicester back-line. Spence took one touch to compose himself before sliding his shot into the far bottom corner. It was a fitting finish for a display balancing fight and finesse.",Sport/Football,Nottingham Forest humiliate Leicester to keep FA Cup dream alive,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/nottingham-forest-leicester-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report
2/7/2022,"Labour has called on the Tories to return money from donors with links to Russia in the wake of tensions over Vladimir Putin’s military buildup on the Ukraine border. In a joint letter, David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, called on ministers to address Russian finance flowing into the UK.  Writing to their counterparts, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, both possible contenders to succeed Boris Johnson in No 10, Lammy and Reeves said: “Donors who have made money from Russia or have alleged links to the Putin regime have given £1.93m to either the Conservative party or individual Conservative associations since Boris Johnson took power in July 2019. Will the Conservative party agree to return it?” Truss has said oligarchs and key supporters of Putin will be targeted by UK sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine, but offered no new money-laundering curbs. The Foreign Office has threatened to seize the wealth of Putin’s inner political circle and business backers. But Labour criticised the package for failing to speed up the long-promised structural measures to tackle money laundering in the UK, including measures first announced by David Cameron in 2014 and 2015. In their joint letter, Lammy and Reeves said: “We believe, however, that there is much more that can be done to address the UK’s openness to suspect Russian money … “For years, the Labour party have raised the alarm about the role of dirty money in the UK and the lack of action from the Conservative government. Despite repeated warnings, the government has been asleep at the wheel and needlessly left our defences down at home.” They said this “openness to illicit finance has begun to damage our diplomatic efforts, with the Biden administration being warned that the widespread presence of suspect Russian money in the UK could jeopardise Britain’s response to this crisis”. Johnson last week committed to bringing forward an economic crime bill in the third session of parliament but Labour said this should already have happened. In particular, they called for reform of Companies House to prevent fraud and abuse, a register of overseas entities, foreign agent registration, new counter-espionage laws, a replacement for the computer misuse act and additional powers for the Electoral Commission. “We can’t stand up to Russia’s aggression abroad while ignoring Russian-linked corruption at home,” they said. “It is in our national and economic interests for the government to address the challenges of hostile influence and interference which the government’s inaction and behaviour have regrettably permitted.” Last week, the Guardian reported that anti-corruption campaigners were accusing the government of failing to curtail Russian wealth and influence in Britain, despite years of provocative actions from the Kremlin. In response to the Lammy and Reeves letter, a Conservative party spokesperson said: “The Conservative party only accepts donations from permissible sources, namely individuals registered on the UK’s electoral roll or UK registered companies. “Donations are transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and openly published by them.”",News/World news,Labour calls on Tories to return money from donors linked to Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/labour-calls-on-tories-to-return-money-from-donors-linked-to-russia
2/7/2022,"A woman is taking legal action against the Metropolitan police after a detective who told her she was “amazingly hot” while investigating her attack kept his job. Kristina O’Connor, now 33, said she was sent inappropriate messages by DCI James Mason after he responded to her report of an attempted robbery in October 2011.  The officer asked her out to dinner while taking her statement about the incident, in which she was assaulted by a group of men trying to steal her phone, the Sunday Times reported. Mason, who went on to work alongside the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, then sent O’Connor a series of personal emails including one telling her she was “amazingly hot”. O’Connor, the daughter of the late comedian Des O’Connor, told reporters: “I no longer trust the police. I feel that I am as likely to be abused by a police officer as I am by anyone else and perhaps even more likely, as I’ve seen that police officers can harm people with impunity. I am fearful of having to call or depend upon the police.” After her complaint about Mason, who was at the time of the incident a detective sergeant, a panel at a police misconduct hearing last year found him guilty of gross misconduct. The Met has confirmed he remains a serving officer. “I feel appalled that the officer in question is still serving … I question what it takes for an officer to be dismissed. It makes a mockery of the misconduct process that he continues to serve,” O’Connor said. O’Connor’s intervention comes after an official report revealed shocking details of Metropolitan police officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, as well as the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said the hateful and offensive remarks were part of a Met culture that needed to be rooted out. Last month, it emerged that the Met had apologised and paid compensation to an academic for “sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language” used by officers about her when she was strip-searched. Lawyers for O’Connor are arguing that the force “failed to properly investigate” her complaint as a case of gender discrimination. They are seeking a judicial review of how the investigation was handled. A Met spokesperson said: “We recognise there is a need for real change in the Met. We are committed to creating an environment that is intolerant to those who do not uphold the high values and standards expected of us.” They added: “Any victim of crime should have the confidence and trust to come to police to receive the support and professionalism they rightfully expect. “Where this does not happen, we want to know about it so any learning and, if appropriate, disciplinary action can be taken.”",News/UK news,Woman takes legal action after Met officer who called her ‘hot’ keeps job,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/06/woman-takes-legal-action-after-met-officer-who-called-her-hot-keeps-job
2/7/2022,"My husband Mike Jackson, who has died aged 73 following a long illness, had a distinguished career as a full-time official of the public sector union Nupe, and later of Unison. He was also active as a councillor in Watford. From 2004 he was Unison’s deputy head of health, in which capacity he acted as the lead negotiator for NHS pay talks. He was involved in annual rounds of negotiations on pay and conditions, including those that led to Agenda for Change, the pay and grading structure for NHS staff, which remains in place today.  Mike retired from Unison in 2011 but continued to put his extensive experience and talents to good use as a project manager for NHS East of England, where he was involved in the establishment of the Talent for Care national strategic framework, helping NHS staff to develop a long-term career strategy. Born in Derby, Mike was the eldest of three sons of Peter Jackson, who worked for British Rail, and Kathleen (nee McEvoy), a nurse. She died when Mike was 11 and his father subsequently married Daphne Wakefield, a nursery nurse; they went on to have a daughter. The family had by then moved south with Peter’s job, to the Watford area, and Watford remained Mike’s home almost continuously until his death, with only two short periods living elsewhere. He was a lifelong supporter of Watford FC, and the ability to walk to the ground in under 20 minutes was an essential criterion in his choice of home. After leaving St Albans grammar school, Mike worked for National Carriers, then Rolls-Royce. He went to Warwick University in 1974 and immediately became involved in student politics. He was elected to the national committee of the National Organisation of Labour Students in 1976 and as its national chair in 1977. He became a Nupe regional organiser in Greater London in 1978. He had joined the Labour party in 1972. His ability as an organiser was soon recognised and he took on positions of responsibility, eventually becoming election agent, a role he undertook in every Watford borough and county council election from 1983 to 2019. He also acted as agent for the general and mayoral elections from 1997 to 2019. He was elected to Watford council in 1980, and was leader of the council from 1990 until 1994, a period of great turmoil and challenge. He was a vociferous opponent of the Conservative government’s right-to-buy policy. Watford council avoided implementing it for as long as possible. Mike also initiated numerous progressive policies including declaring Watford a nuclear-free zone, the establishment of the town’s first women’s refuge and many environmental initiatives. He was selected as Watford’s candidate to fight the general elections of 1987 and 1992, and increased Labour’s share of the vote. His dedication to the party was formally recognised in 2020 when he was presented with the Merit Award for Outstanding Contribution by Jeremy Corbyn. After his retirement in 2015, Mike spent time with his grandchildren, also travelling, walking, gardening and supporting his beloved Hornets. He and I first met at Watford council and became a couple in 1994; we married in 2017. He is survived by me, his daughter, Alice, from his first marriage, to Judi, which ended in divorce, by three grandchildren, Ava, Otto and Kit, and his brothers, Guy and John, and sister, Carolyn.",News/Politics,Mike Jackson obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/mike-jackson-obituary
2/7/2022,"My mother, Karen Walton, who has died aged 85, loved art and literature, and was passionate about animal welfare, equality and trees. She was loving, creative, intelligent, infuriating and chaotic. Born in Dulwich, south London, to parents who were also creative – a painter and camouflage artist, Henry Hoyland, and a poet and puppet-maker, Margret (nee Mitchell-Withers) – she had an eccentric childhood with her sister, Rosemary. By the time Karen was 12, both her parents had died of cancer and she was bought up by her aunt.  From Sydenham high school, Karen went to the Central School of Arts and Crafts (now the Central School of Art and Design). In 1959, she met the theatrical producer Richard Walton. They married in 1961, and shared their love for theatre, music and art with wonderful friends, spending late nights enjoying good food and plenty of wine. I was born in 1963 and my brother, Charlie, three years later. We grew up to the sounds of Bobbie Gentry and the Rolling Stones, with summers spent in Cornwall, walking the coast paths, sailing, surfing and singing to the seals. After 26 years of marriage, which was later dissolved, Karen struck out alone and retrained as a Tefl teacher. She taught at Chiswick College, west London, as well as tutoring private students for 10 years or more. She made two beautiful homes, the first in Chiswick; the second a flat overlooking Streatham Common, which was flooded with sunlight and filled with colour, paintings and books. Animal welfare was very important to her; her cats were her greatest companions. Another enormous passion was trees, and her home overlooking the common was surrounded by them, which brought her great joy. After discovering she had cancer in early 2021, she chose not to have treatment or share her diagnosis with others. She had enjoyed a wonderful life and wanted to make the most of the time she had left. She lived independently at home until September last year when an unrelated illness led to a respite stay at Birtley House, a care home outside Guildford, in Surrey. It was there, happy and surrounded by beautiful trees, that she chose to spend her last few months. My mother’s life swung from the reserved to the highly emotional; the predictable to the totally unpredictable; from the joy-filled to deep troughs. She treasured strong friendships that she had nurtured across the decades and displayed great empathy.

2/7/2022,"Just one weekend in and the Six Nations is already stirring powerful emotions. In Scotland, with the Calcutta Cup under lock and key once again, there is renewed optimism and pride after the significant outcome on Saturday. And in England? To say Eddie Jones and his squad headed homewards with much to ponder is a familiar understatement. Even given the tricky conditions at Murrayfield, the visitors’ 20-17 defeat will be a source of acute and prolonged frustration. Apart from anything else, a couple of uneasy trends are emerging. For the third successive year any faint grand slam hopes have vanished within 80 minutes and, for the fourth time in five seasons, Jones has been unable to outflank Scotland’s head coach Gregor Townsend.  If England are going to conquer the world next year, they could do a lot worse than take several leaves from Scotland’s book. Did Townsend whip off his fly-half Finn Russell at the start of the final quarter with his team trailing 17-10? Of course he didn’t. The Scots had a clear plan, stayed calm, trusted in their playmaker’s ability and, ultimately, reaped the rewards for doing so. And England? The flawed decision to remove Marcus Smith from the fray neatly symbolised the split personality that remains a feature of Jones’s regime. The young fly-half had done pretty much everything asked of him and put England in front with the kind of smart, excellently taken try that separates a high-class fly-half from a moderate one. But then – boom – he was gone. Rather than being trusted to finish the job off, he was sitting idle in the stand. It felt very much like a conservative move and, even worse, a premeditated one. Had the game been at Twickenham, the boos of English supporters would have rung loudly around the stadium. As it was, English momentum and composure largely disappeared with him. Of course there were other unrelated factors involved. Maybe England did not always enjoy the rub of the green. Russell definitely deserved credit for the two inch-perfect punts that ended up stretching the red rose defence to breaking point. And it was a team decision, in the end, to go for that fateful late lineout rather than the penalty kick at goal that might have yielded a draw. The fact George Ford’s tentative punt and Sam Skinner’s steal combined to ruin the visitors’ day cannot be entirely laid at the management’s door. Then again, maybe it is time to acknowledge that tight officiating decisions or absent friends are not the primary reason why England are still blowing hot and cold, and now stand on the verge of another awkward campaign. Their issue is not a shortage of talented individuals or enviable depth or even increasing captaincy options. They simply lack the collective clarity of thought that Scotland, and others, are currently exhibiting. The game on Saturday was a perfect example. How did they end up with so little in the way of dynamic gain-line penetration beyond the occasional thrust from their back-rowers Sam Simmonds and Lewis Ludlam? How come the home side kicked so much more effectively? Was Joe Marler’s lineout throwing really the way forward? And, if they were really intent on playing fast and going for it, how did that square with hauling off Smith at the game’s pivotal point? Italy in Rome this Sunday should at least offer the opportunity to smooth away some of that angst. There is no question, either, that England’s rolling maul is starting to look far more effective. Two years ago they also lost their opening fixture and went on to hoist the title. It is far from impossible that they can still defeat Wales and Ireland at Twickenham and then head to Paris with much at stake next month. In that event, Jones will be fully entitled to enjoy the moment. No one relishes the constant tactical puzzles of international rugby more than the Australian and he continues to scour the sporting world for the little tweaks that might help him solve the game’s biggest conundrums. That said, Jones tenure of England increasingly feels as if it is being sponsored by Wordle: there seems to be a different problem to solve every day. No one is saying it is a simple task but surely Smith is the five-letter answer, not a question mark? The lack of consistent and absolute faith in people feels like the thing that is arguably disrupting England the most. Either way, enough assistant coaches and support staff have already come and gone for this to be a crucial period for the Jones project. The constant changes of tack – both stylistic and selectorially – are in sharp contrast with the largely settled environments of their main rivals and time is no longer on the management’s side. For all the talk of England’s youth and inexperience, Jamie George and Marler are 31, Ben Youngs will be 34 next year and Manu Tuilagi, forever the longed-for saviour, turns 31 in May. Owen Farrell was 30 last September and Jonny May will be 32 in April. Kyle Sinckler, Henry Slade and Elliot Daly will all be on the wrong side of 30 by the 2023 World Cup. For now, though, Jones’s priorities are simple enough. Put an arm around Luke Cowan-Dickie, ensure the Exeter hooker is not put in such an invidious defensive position again, quietly apologise to Smith and instruct his players to take out their irritation on Italy. Marler, Jack Nowell, Alex Dombrandt and Harry Randall will all be hoping for a start in Rome and it already feels as if this Six Nations season still has plenty of twists to come. England will not recall their Edinburgh weekend fondly but they remain in charge of their own destiny.",Sport/Sport,Smith exit shows split personality of Eddie Jones’s England regime remains | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/smith-exit-shows-split-personality-of-eddie-joness-england-regime-remains
2/7/2022,"The residents of Ramsay Street have survived almost four decades of affairs, disasters and terrible haircuts – but in the end it might be the popularity of a 1930s Yorkshire vet that finally kills off Neighbours. The long-running soap opera that launched the careers of Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie faces the axe after Channel 5 confirmed it would stop airing the series this summer. The broadcaster no longer wants to spend millions of pounds a year on the show and is instead looking to use its programme budget to reach upmarket audiences with original British dramas – driven by the success of All Creatures Great And Small, its hit revival of the series about rural life in the Yorkshire Dales.  Neighbours is made in Australia, but its popularity has waned in its homeland. As a result, the cost of making it is largely met by the UK’s Channel 5, which has been the show’s British home since it poached the programme from the BBC in 2008 as part of a £300m deal. “Neighbours will no longer air on Channel 5 beyond this summer,” said a spokesperson. “We recognise that there will be disappointment about this decision, however our current focus is on increasing our investment in original UK drama, which has strong appeal for our viewers.” Unless Neighbours’ production company Fremantle can urgently find a new overseas broadcaster to subsidise it, the longest-running programme in Australian television history will end this summer after 37 years on screen. It is consistently one of Channel 5’s most watched programmes, attracting roughly a million viewers a day, but it is expensive to make and its cancellation appears to be part of the broadcaster’s efforts to shed its reputation as the television home of “films, football and fucking”. Channel 5 has reinvented itself over the past decade under its boss, Ben Frow, often going against industry trends and embracing older regional audiences who still watch broadcast television when its rivals chase younger viewers on streaming services. As a result, it has steadily built its viewing aided by programmes about the royals, steam trains and almost anything with Yorkshire in the title. Channel 5 used to rely on buying up the rights to US dramas, but it decided to return to commissioning its own original British dramas in 2008. Its breakthrough hit was All Creatures Great and Small, a reboot of the much-loved BBC series of the 1970s and 80s, which launched during the pandemic, It attracted the channel’s highest ratings in five years and has been a critical success. The Guardian’s review described it as “a sweet, gentle, deliberately mild remake of a programme you can vaguely recollect watching all those years ago” and “the television equivalent of taking your brain out and dunking it into a bucket of warm tea”. It has also reached large audiences in the US, where viewers saw the appeal of watching a vet drive a vintage car across the English countryside before being kicked by a cow. Although such shows are expensive to make, they can also attract big audiences and the wealthier viewers that advertisers want to reach. Last week Channel 5 aired the original four-part series The Teacher starring Sheridan Smith, which attracted more than 2 million viewers every night – substantially more than were watching Channel 4 in the same time slot. After other hits, including the thriller The Drowning, Channel 5 says it intends to double its spending on original UK drama this year. Frow, an idiosyncratic industry figure, has already canned other longrunning Channel 5 series including Big Brother to free up budget and airtime for his own commissions. A spokesperson declined to comment on the suggestion that the channel might also want to axe Home and Away, another long-running Australia soap opera that it has aired for two decades. As for Neighbours, the show’s cast and crew have been warned that filming could stop in June, leaving them months to wrap up all the existing storylines. There is speculation they could try to persuade previous stars – such as Minogue and Donovan – to return to the programme for one last appearance, in the hope that good Neighbours can become good ends.",Arts/Television & radio,Curtains for Ramsay Street as Channel 5 no longer needs good Neighbours,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/06/curtains-for-ramsay-street-as-channel-5-no-longer-needs-good-neighbours
2/7/2022,"In July 2018, Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, wrote an article in the best-known local English-language newspaper, the South China Morning Post, stressing to Americans the territory’s unique position an Asian business hub. “The US is forgetting the differences between Hong Kong and China. Let’s remind them,” she wrote. “Hong Kong continues to have a robust and hearty infrastructure of values, practices and institutions that could not contrast more starkly with those of the mainland system.”  Now, packing up and leaving the city after more than 20 years there, Joseph listed “dizzying changes” since that op-ed. In 2019, the “anti-extradition bill protests kicked things off … then we had worsening US-China relations … now there’s Covid.” For Joseph, Hong Kong’s stringent zero-Covid rules are the final trigger for her departure. She is joining a growing list of American expats who have either left the territory or are pondering going. According to a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce, 44% of members were thinking of leaving Hong Kong due to the territory’s strict pandemic rules. Of the companies surveyed, 26% said they were considering relocation. “One of the things that’s really hurting at this point is there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel,” Joseph said. The administration of Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive, has insisted its coronavirus rules will not affect Hong Kong’s standing as a business hub. But Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, said last month that travel restrictions were leaving the territory “increasingly isolated”. Yet for many Hong Kong-based businesses, the Covid-induced separation is just the latest in a series of complications they have faced. Since Beijing imposed the national security law in the summer of 2020, executives say there has been a growing sense of uncertainty among businesses – both local or foreign. The authorities insist the law brought the territory “back on the right track” following months of street protests in 2019 and was necessary to ensure the national security of China. The law matches a series of crimes including secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with penalties as severe as life in prison. Opponents have criticised its broad scope as “draconian”. Alina Smith – not her real name - a senior executive from the US, said that although the law does not directly affect most firms, the aftermath of its passage has created more uncertainties in the operating environment and had left firms facing “a very special conundrum”. Smith has been living and working in Hong Kong for more than a decade. She said that until recently, the business community there did not have to worry too much. “We were able to put our heads down and do business. Now, we have to play all sides,” she said. “But this is a mission impossible, and you also don’t know where the line is these days.” More than three years marked by protests, the national security law’s imposition and Covid restrictions have had their effect on Hong Kong’s once freewheeling business community, Smith added. “And in particular for those who also operate in China, you have to toe the government line. But the irony is that if you toe the Beijing line, Washington will be unhappy. “So what are you going to do? Well, just don’t say anything … Meanwhile we are watching more of our friends leave because the territory has changed. As some say, ‘It’s now not a question of whether, but when’.” Not all businesses feel the need to hide their political leanings, however. Some – for example the London-headquartered banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered – have already articulated their position. “We respect and support laws and regulations that will enable Hong Kong to recover and rebuild the economy and, at the same time, maintain the principle of ‘one country, two systems’,” HSBC said in 2020. Around the same time, Standard Chartered said: “We believe the national security law can help maintain the long-term economic and social stability of Hong Kong.” These public political statements did not go down well in the UK, which had opposed the law. After the HSBC statement the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said his government “will not sacrifice the people of Hong Kong over the altar of banker bonuses”. “Everyone is walking a fine line here, and I’m afraid things aren’t going to get better,” said Prof Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at The Fletcher School at Tufts University in Boston. “Businesses these days feel they need to balance between their political capital and their ‘capital capital’.” Perhaps the most thorny and sensitive issue confronting many China-facing businesses in Hong Kong in the past year is Xinjiang: the far-west Chinese province where UN experts and rights groups estimate that more than 1 million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities,are being incarcerated. While Beijing has denied all accusations of human rights abuses in the region, last summer the US Senate passed a bill to ban imports from Xinjiang. This has immediately affected those work in supply chain and sourcing. For decades, Hong Kong has been Asia’s leading sourcing hub, through which materials move in and out of Mainland China. Now the increasingly hostile exchanges between Washington and Beijing are forcing the sector to pick a side, analysts say. While many smaller businesses, such as Smith’s, refuse to engage in making public statements on controversial issues, others, in particular big apparel brands have been caught in the crosshairs. Last March, the Swedish clothing chain H&M was singled out by China’s state media and faced a huge backlash after it had expressed concern about Beijing’s alleged use forced labour in cotton production in Xinjiang. Immediately, some Chinese internet users called for a boycott and e-commerce platforms dropped sales of H&M. The world’s second-largest global clothing retailer saw its revenues drop significantly as a result. It later indirectly addressed the controversy in its 2021 first quarter earnings report, saying: “We are dedicated to regaining the trust and confidence of our customers, colleagues, and business partners in China.” Such conflicts do not occur only inside China, however. Late last year, the US short-term holiday rental company Airbnb was found by US media to be listing more than a dozen properties on land owned by the Xinjiang paramilitary corporation, which was sanctioned by Washington over its alleged involvement in mass human rights abuses. The US outlet Axios said the company was at risk of exposure to US regulations preventing business dealings with sanctioned entities. Airbnb, which also sponsors the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, said US rules required it to “screen the parties we are transacting with, not the underlying landowners”. “Increasingly, sourcing and supply chain businesses don’t have an option. Yes, they can have their concerns and some could move to Singapore or South Korea, but their businesses are fixed pipelines. It’d be extremely costly to change that, and Beijing understands it,” Chakravorti said. “To most players, they are just stuck.” Despite the politics and the pandemic, Joseph said the China market was just too lucrative for ambitious Hong Kong-based executives to miss. “The Hong Kong I have known for 20 years has been going, going and gone. A new Hong Kong is emerging. Now it’s a very painful period of time,” she said. “But in many ways Hong Kong is still a big business hub. After all, capital flows don’t have to wear a mask; money doesn’t have to wear a mask.”",News/World news,‘No light at the end of the tunnel’ – Americans join Hong Kong’s business exodus ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-americans-join-hong-kongs-business-exodus
2/7/2022,"The violinist Julia Fischer is artist-in-residence with the London Philharmonic this spring. Her first group of concerts with the orchestra focusses on Mozart, with all five of his solo-violin concertos spread across three programmes. In the second of them, with Thomas Søndergård conducting, she played the fifth concerto, in A major, K219, as well as the Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, K364. There is no doubting the technical security of Fischer’s playing, nor the understated authority of her musicianship. But her account of the concerto was unsmiling and short on charm. With rather curt, peremptory phrasing, emotions kept on the shortest rein and little inclination to relish moments of lyricism even in the central Adagio, it was all oddly joyless.  Joined by the violist Nils Mönkemeyer for the Sinfonia Concertante, Fischer did seem more relaxed, though there was still something rather perfunctory about their performance. On this evidence Mönkemeyer isn’t an expansively expressive player either, and there was little of the playful give-and-take one associates with the best performances of this extraordinary work, let alone any obvious attempt to explore the depths of its slow movement, perhaps the most profound music Mozart had written up to that point in his life. It was left to Søndergård to inject a bit of life into the evening. He’d opened the concert with a suitably bright and brash account of the overture to Mozart’s Die Entführung aus dem Serail – tying in nicely with the “Turkish music” episode in the finale of the A major concerto. Then, with the LPO forces almost doubled in size just for this one work, he closed it with a brilliantly coloured romp through Strauss’s tone poem Till Eulenspiegel, depicting each of its picaresque episodes with sardonic vividness. A further concert in the series will be held on 12 February.",Arts/Music,Julia Fischer/LPO/Thomas Søndergård review – authoritative but short on charm,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/julia-fischer-lpo-thomas-sondergard-review-mozart
2/7/2022,"Supposedly this was a question of how many tries France would score; how quickly they would emulate the bonus-point victory achieved so ruthlessly by Ireland against Wales on Saturday. As it turned out, a brave and coherent display by Italy and a sodden afternoon in Paris combined to make it more difficult than expected. For all the recent talk of a ‘New England’ in the Six Nations, and despite their 27-point defeat, perhaps it is Kieran Crowley’s Italy that are starting afresh. They were ultimately overwhelmed by Gabin Villière’s hat-trick but can be proud of the way they defended. It was more than simple passion and commitment: there was a plan and a structure. A muscular early run by Juan Ignacio Brex hinted at a testing time ahead for France.  However, the French full-back Melvyn Jaminet kicked a penalty after five minutes, and Les Bleus’ first concerted attempt to run the ball looked ominous. The fly-half Romain Ntamack found Gaël Fickou in the Italian 22, whose angled grubber narrowly evaded Villière on the left. Italy were in Paris to play, though. When Jaminet failed to gather Stephen Varney’s fine, hanging box kick, Federico Ruzza pounced and carried into the 22. After another strong Italian run, Paolo Garbisi launched a cross-kick right, where the debutant Tommaso Menoncello was loitering. The 19-year-old Benetton wing did remarkably well to catch, stay fractionally in touch on landing, and dot down. The legality of the score was confirmed by the TMO. When Garbisi drilled the conversion unerringly through the sticks, Italy – and any neutral viewer hoping for a contest – rejoiced. Italy had another penalty when Uini Atonio was penalised for holding on but from the resulting lineout, Cameron Woki spoilt Italian ball and Varney’s improvised pass was stolen by Anthony Jelonch, who sprinted clear and dived over. France edged back ahead only for another Garbisi penalty to re-establish the Azzurri’s lead. As the first-half clock ticked into in the red, France opted to kick a penalty for the corner. Woki claimed the set-piece and then came a glimmer of French flair, the ball speeding through the hands of the inside centre Jonathan Danty, Ntamack and wing Damian Penaud. That all created an overlap for Villière, who made use of the drenched pitch to dive early and slide in for France’s second try. Another cultured strike off the tee by Jaminet made it 18-10 at half-time. France attacked the second half with renewed vigour and Danty crashed to within inches of the line two minutes after the break. After a long TMO check, Julien Marchand was found at fault for his follow-up attempt to score and Italy escaped. Gianmarco Lucchesi’s work at the breakdown, winning another penalty, was celebrated enthusiastically but a couple of minutes later, when Garbisi was turned over, a brilliant offload by Grégory Alldritt had Villière jinking to the try line for a second time. It was 23-10 and Italy held firm for nearly another 20 minutes, remaining within two converted scores, as Penaud narrowly failed to flick up a Ntamack kick up into his hands. It was Penaud who threatened again four minutes later, racing clear and kicking beyond the replacement Leonardo Marin, who body-checked him. The French fans wailed at replays but the officials deemed the challenge legal: and France’s hunt for the bonus point continued. It was secured with 12 minutes left, Penaud and Antoine Dupont exchanging passes and tearing down the French right wing, Penaud running in the fourth try, and Jaminet belting another beautiful strike through the posts. Beyond 80 minutes on the clock, Villière dived over for his hat-trick after some sustained late pressure – which was perhaps a little harsh on Italy. Fabien Galthié, absent after testing positive for Covid-19, has seen his team tested before next week’s potentially crucial match against Ireland in Paris. He should be pleased about that.",Sport/Sport,Gabin Villière hat-trick fires France to opening victory against Italy,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/france-italy-six-nations-match-report
2/7/2022,"Just like old times; well, a little bit, at least. Adama Traoré is back, Xavi Hernández is back, and Dani Alves is back. Even Luis Suárez was back in front of the Camp Nou fans and scoring, another familiar face to go with the new ones here. It would be a stretch to suggest that FC Barcelona are back – it would be absurd, in fact – but this victory was their first against Atlético Madrid in five meetings, lifting them over Diego Simeone’s side and into a Champions League place they have not looked like occupying all season. Just as importantly, it was as much fun as they have had for a long time. Traoré, the kid who played his last and until now only league game for the club in the 2013-14 season, returned for his second debut and for a while ripped into Atlético, providing an assist as Barcelona came from behind to win 4-2. Alves, who last scored here in 2015, assisted, scored, leapt into Xavi’s arms, and was sent off. And even Jordi Alba got on the scoresheet on an afternoon where fans might have wondered what year it is.  Mostly, though, they just enjoyed it, singing their way to the final whistle, wondering if maybe, just maybe, a team may be forming here after all. Because if their vulnerability remains, if they were made to suffer a little in the second half, this was an enjoyable afternoon in the sun, one that perhaps promised more. They had only been out there a hundred seconds when Traoré was dumped on the floor for the first time – and, it would turn out, the last. If that suggested that Atlético were aware of the threat he could pose, it didn’t mean that they were able to stop him. He just got up, dusted himself down, and ran at them over and over again, a storm brewing on the right that Yannick Carrasco momentarily bamboozling him with a nutmeg could not avoid. That even Carrasco scoring to give Atlético an early lead couldn’t, in fact. A neatly weighted pass from Suárez made it. Back in front of the Camp Nou fans for the first time, he bent the ball into the path of Yannick Carrasco to sweep first time beyond Marc Andre ter Stegen from close range. The game was just seven minutes and Simeone’s side had the lead but it didn’t last. And if Carrasco was decisive there, attacking on the right, as time went on, he would appear more often in the opposite corner, trying to help Mario Hermoso’s attempt to hold back the tide. Almost immediately, Barcelona were level. Alves and Alba – combined age, over 70 – connected, he Brazilian clipping a gorgeous ball over to the other full-back to volley an equally gorgeous shot into the net. It looked like that, at last – in truth it might have hit his shin – and Alba was off and running, gesturing for his critics to keep talking. Why would they? Watching this was much more fun. They weren’t even halfway through the first period and it could early have been 2-2 or 3-3. Instead, it was 2-1 to Barcelona. Joâo Felix curled just wide and then scuffed a glorious chance deep inside the Barcelona area. Between those two efforts, Traoré had set off, stopped, set off again and clipped an impeccable cross onto the head of Gavi. Next, Pedri skied his effort. Barcelona had the ball, and they moved it fast. Too fast for Atlético, Jan Oblak and Carrasco almost tying themselves in knots soon after. Traoré tore into Hermoso, especially when Alves came to join him. At 38, the legs and the lungs may not work the way they once did but the head does, the feet too. Nobody reads the game like him, the awareness and intelligence an all-too-overlooked part of his armoury. His filtered pass saw Ferran Torres hit over and just before half-time he provided the free-kick from which Gerard Piqué headed against the bar. Torres could not connect with the rebound, but Ronald Araújo could, smashing in the third. Alves then had a moment of his own, one that was all of theirs. He crashed in the shot after neat work from Gavi, 21 years his junior, and the Camp Nou almost came down. Racing to the touchline, wearing that grin and chased by his teammates, Alves embraced Xavi – a teammate last time he was here, his coach now – and then everyone else, too. They were enjoying this, the volume rising only to be silenced when the man who scored 198 goals for them now scored against them for the second time. He might have got another not long after, but sliced the kind of shot that usually ends up in the net. Atlético, though, were awake now, given hope: all the more so when Alves was sent off with 20 minutes to go after he caught Carrasco high on the calf with a full set of studs. Alves left, shaking his head, the crowd chanting his name but it was a poor challenge, an error that threatened to be costly. Atlético had reacted well and were taking the game to a team that still look vulnerable at the back. The threat never fully materialised, though, and Barcelona saw it out, noise rising around this arena. It seemed it was a match now but then it had been from the start and, boy, was it good. A bit like it used to be.",Sport/Football,Barcelona roll back the years in thrilling win over Atlético Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/barcelona-roll-back-the-years-in-thrilling-win-over-atletico-madrid
