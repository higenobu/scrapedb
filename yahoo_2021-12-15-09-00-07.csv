12/15/2021,"A Wisconsin woman is charged with first-degree murder after allegedly killing a man she had recently met online, by stabbing him then intentionally running him over, after which she circled the block and ran down the victim again “to make sure he was dead,” according to a criminal complaint filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. Lydia Carmona-Cartagena, 23, appeared in court Monday on charges of first-degree intentional homicide and use of a dangerous weapon. The five-foot-tall Carmona-Cartagena has been arrested previously for felony domestic abuse, and remains jailed on $100,000 cash bond. She faces life in prison if convicted of the new charges. The gruesome incident occurred in the early hours of Dec. 9, the complaint states. Shortly after 5:45 a.m., a witness identified in the filing only as “JH” got out of the shower and heard yelling outside. When JH looked out the window, she saw Carmona-Cartagena “tussling” with 41-year-old Chad Wilson, the complaint states. JH said it initially looked like Wilson was on top of Carmona-Cartagena, hitting her, but she realized things were the other way around when she observed Carmona-Cartagena “pulling [Wilson] and dragging him.” Man Confesses to Murdering Ex-Girlfriend on Livestream Before Killing Ex-Wife and Himself Carmona-Cartagena later told police she and Wilson met on Facebook a week or two earlier, according to the complaint. They got together for the first time on Dec. 8 and spent “approximately 24 hours” together, the complaint explains, which says that “while hanging out, they drank some alcohol and did drugs, including cocaine.” But somewhere along the line, things took a dark turn. At Wilson’s house, Carmona-Cartagena “was putting a lighter and cups on the tables which angered [Wilson],” says the complaint. “She did not like that he was being aggressive, so she asked him to drive her home.” On the way, Wilson stopped and told her to get out, the complaint alleges. Carmona-Cartagena “was not happy because she had a big bag of clothing that she would have to carry home,” it says. She then took a knife out of her purse, chased Wilson across the street, and allegedly “stabbed him 3 times [in] the legs and abdomen” before Wilson was able to get the knife away from Carmona-Cartagena. As Wilson was screaming for help, Carmona-Cartagena “walked over and kicked [him] in the face while he was on the ground ‘like a dog,’” JH told detectives, explaining that Carmona-Cartagena then got into Wilson’s black Cadillac SUV and “drove at [Wilson]...seemingly trying to hit him with the car,” states the complaint. Wilson managed to hide behind a tree, according to JH, who estimated Carmona-Cartagena hit Wilson with the car “three or four times.” “JH said that [Carmona-Cartagena] then drove around the block and hit [Wilson] again,” says the complaint. “JH described multiple times that [Carmona-Cartagena] ran over [Wilson], even after driving around the block or through neighbors’ yards. JH said that ultimately she saw [Carmona-Cartagena] run over [Wilson]’s neck and head.” JH then saw Carmona-Cartagena standing over Wilson, saying something to him, according to the complaint. She “left when sirens started,” and fled the scene by driving off into a nearby alleyway. Another witness, identified in the complaint as “TP,” told detectives she left her house around 6:05 a.m. and “saw something in the street that she initially thought was an animal.” “TP had to swerve around the object and saw that it was a human body,” says the complaint. TP pulled over and called 911. While she was on the phone, TP said she saw a black SUV coming up from behind her and tried to stop the driver from hitting Wilson’s body again. Carmona-Cartagena then got out of the vehicle and stood over the body “without saying a word,” looked at TP, and drove away, according to the complaint. Both eyewitness accounts were backed up by surveillance video from a nearby church, the complaint states. Wilson was pronounced dead by the Milwaukee Fire Department at 6:24 a.m. “due to injuries from being run over by [the] vehicle,” says the complaint. Detectives mounted a search for the SUV, which they eventually located about a block away, in Carmona-Cartagena’s driveway. She was sitting inside the car, which “had accident damage and blood on the front passenger side headlight and grill [sic],” according to the complaint. Officers placed Carmona-Cartagena under arrest, after which she made “several unsolicited statements,” the complaint continues. “I know why I hit him, for my safety, but I was hoping that he was still ok,” Carmona-Cartagena told first responders, claiming she ran over Wilson because “he was going to pull a gun on her.” Carmona-Cartagena allegedly admitted grabbing Wilson’s car keys as he lay bleeding on the ground, then getting back into his SUV, and driving towards him. “She stated that she missed a couple of times and was finally able to hit him in the street,” according to the complaint. “She saw he was still moving after she ran him over the first time, so she ran him over a few more times to make sure he was dead. She stated she ran him over the first time to kill him. She knew that she had numerous opportunities to just drive away, but she thought he was a gang member and had access to guns and would come and retaliate.” After allegedly killing Wilson, who was described by local NBC affiliate WTMJ as a community advocate involved in helping formerly incarcerated people reintegrate into society, the complaint says Carmona-Cartagena told police she walked up to Wilson “and knew he was dead so she leaned over and closed his eyes. She then left the scene when she heard the sirens getting closer. She drove to her residence and a squad pulled up at her house a short time later.” An autopsy determined Wilson’s death to be homicide caused by blunt force trauma. His family was unable to be reached on Tuesday. Carmona-Cartagena’s public defender, Vincent Paul Guimont, did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment. Carmona-Cartagena is due back in court for a preliminary hearing on Dec. 23. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

12/15/2021,"If you’re a homeowner in Boise these days, it might be a good idea to plan on sticking around for a while. The latest survey from Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University looks at the nation’s most overvalued homes and continues to show Idaho’s capital (and largest) city at the top of the list. Homes there in November were priced at an 80.5% premium, researchers said. The updated list is similar to a survey put out by the schools in August in terms of which cities appear, but the premium has increased in many markets. And Atlanta has replaced Stockton, Calif., in the top 10. (Dallas failed to make the Top 10, but has also shown a steep increase in how much of a premium buyers are paying.) While some of these cities are still showing up on lists of the fastest-growing markets, researchers say the numbers indicate housing prices in many metro areas are poised to flatten in the future, having neared or reached a peak of the current housing cycle. And buyers now purchasing a home in those areas should be prepared for a difficult time if they hope to resell for a higher value in the near future. Some major cities are showing a much slower rate of housing price increases, researchers note, especially Los Angeles and Miami. That’s resulting in market premiums that are noticeably smaller than at the peak of the last housing cycle in 2007. “This all suggests that some areas of the country learned a valuable lesson about prices, while others hold to the stubborn belief that housing prices grow to the sky,” said Ken H. Johnson, an economist at Florida Atlantic University’s College of Business. Here’s a look at the 10 most overvalued markets and the premium buyers are currently paying (plus the change in the past four months): Boise, Idaho – 80.51% (–0.13%) Austin, Texas – 57.13% (+6.41%) Ogden, Utah – 54.46% (+4.76%) Provo, Utah – 49.18% (+3.02%) Phoenix, Ariz. – 48.94% (+6.63%) Spokane, Wash. – 47.61% (+2.4%) Las Vegas, Nev. – 47.42% (+5.54%) Detroit, Mich. – 47.28% (+1.71%) Salt Lake City, Utah – 42.41% (+4.61%) Atlanta, Ga. – 45.17% (+9.22%) Not all the news is bad: Honolulu remains the most undervalued market, with homes selling for 1.6% less than they should.

12/15/2021,"A Brooklyn Center police commander testified Tuesday about ex-cop Kim Potter's Taser training. Potter is being tried for manslaughter in the April shooting death of Daunte Wright. Potter has said that she intended to grab her Taser and not her gun when she shot Wright. A Brooklyn Center police commander explained the department's policy on how and when to use a Taser during Kim Potter's manslaughter trial on Tuesday. The former Minnesota police officer is facing manslaughter charges for the shooting death of Daunte Wright during a traffic stop in April. Potter and her partner pulled Wright over for driving with an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror, and learned that Wright had a warrant out for his arrest after they stopped his car. Police body-camera footage shows that while Potter's partner tried to place Wright in handcuffs, Potter shot Wright in the chest as he tried to sit down in the driver's seat. The footage shows Potter shouting, ""Taser! Taser! Taser!"" before she shot Wright; Potter later said she intended to grab her Taser instead of her gun. Brooklyn Center Police Commander Garrett Flesland took the witness stand on Tuesday to explain the department's policies on when to use a Taser. The department first started using Tasers in 2002, according to Flesland. Prosecutors displayed documents that showed Potter had been certified on how to use a Taser in 2002, then was recertified in 2005, 2007, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019, receiving perfect scores each time. Officers are instructed to carry their Taser on their non-dominant side, and there are two different ways officers can holster their Tasers, Flesland explained. The first is ""cross draw,"" meaning that the handle of the Taser is pointed to the front of the body, making it easier to grab the weapon with the dominant hand. The second is ""reaction draw,"" meaning that the handle of the Taser is pointed toward the back of the body, making it easier to grab with the non-dominant hand. Flesland testified that he carries his Taser on his non-dominant side, in the ""cross draw"" position. Prosecutors showed the jury five still photos from body-camera footage, including from the day Potter shot Wright, that showed the former officer carrying her Taser on her non-dominant side, holstered in the ""reaction draw"" position. Flesland testified that, according to BCPD policy, officers are only to use Tasers ""to control a violent or potentially violent individual while minimizing the risk of serious injury."" Sgt. Mike Peterson, who is in charge of training BCPD officers, also testified Tuesday that officers are trained not to tase someone who is operating a vehicle. Prosecutors also showed the jury a warning that comes from the manufacturer of Tasers, which says not to use the weapon on someone operating a vehicle. Potter's defense has said that she needed to tase Wright to keep him from driving away, because Sgt. Mychal Johnson was leaning into the car and could have been injured. After Potter shot Wright, his car traveled down the street and collided with another vehicle. Flesland testified that BCPD policy only allows officers to shoot at a moving vehicle when they believe there's no other way to stop it, and even then the commander said it's ""rarely effective."" Defense attorney Earl Gray asked Flesland on cross-examination if it would be appropriate to use lethal force if ""another officer is in the front seat, laying over the passenger, trying to stop this guy from going, and he is ignoring the warnings 'Taser! Taser!'"" ""Potentially, yes,"" Flesland responded, ""but I wasn't there.""

12/15/2021,"Eric Trump spoke about his family's political inexperience on a podcast with a former NFL player. ""We weren't smart enough to collude with Russia,"" he said. Eric also recalled asking a campaign staffer what a caucus was on the day of the Iowa caucuses. In an upcoming interview, Eric Trump says that his family was too politically inexperienced and naive to be capable of what critics have accused the Trumps of in the past. Speaking with former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler on his Uncut podcast, Trump joked about how little he and the rest of the family knew about the basics of American politics while his father was running for president in 2016. Trump also referenced the Russia investigation, where Special Counsel Robert Mueller uncovered extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian government-linked individuals but not enough proof of the two sides conspiring to collude in an effort to tilt the election in the former president's favor. ""We weren't smart enough to collude with Russia,"" Trump says at one point. ""We didn't know what the hell we were doing. We didn't know what a delegate was."" As Cutler began laughing, Trump cut into a story from the day of the Iowa caucuses, one of the only contests his father would lose in that year's GOP presidential primary.  ""Jay, I remember walking up to a caucus in Iowa saying, you know, I looked at this young staffer and I go, 'Hey, do you know what a caucus is?'"" Trump said.  Trump added that he didn't know how he would be able to convince voters to back his father over more experienced operatives for rival campaigns. While Eric has ruled out any political ambitions of his own, his wife, Lara, considered running for a US Senate seat in North Carolina in 2022, but ultimately decided not to run. Eric currently serves as executive vice president of the Trump Organization, while Lara is a Fox News contributor.

12/15/2021,"An Antarctic glacier the size of Florida is on the verge of collapse, scientists with the American Geophysical Union warned Monday, a nightmare scenario made worse by climate change that could eventually result in several feet of global sea level rise. The findings were based on new satellite imagery of the Thwaites Glacier, which has been nicknamed the “doomsday glacier,” showing a proliferation of cracks across its surface. “The eastern ice shelf is likely to shatter into hundreds of icebergs,” Oregon State University glaciologist Erin Pettit said at a video news conference Monday. “Suddenly the whole thing would collapse.” Scientists have been monitoring the glacier, the current melting of which contributes to roughly 4 percent of annual sea level rise, for years. Its eastern portion abuts an underwater mountain, and was thought to be more stable, but new satellite images revealed that fractures have developed that are allowing warming ocean waters to speed its disintegration. If the eastern portion of the glacier were to give way, it would hasten the collapse of its other portions, Pettit said, adding that the collapse of the eastern section could occur in the next three to five years, “like the shattering of your car’s window.” “As it’s structured right now, this ice shelf acts like a dam. But it’s not going to for very long,” Pettit said. The chain reaction following the collapse of the eastern section of the glacier could threaten coastal residents around the world, many of whom may be unprepared for a sudden spike in sea level, which has risen slowly due to climate change since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Since 1880, rising global temperatures have resulted in 8 to 9 inches of sea level rise, though the rate of rise has seen a sharp uptick in recent decades. By 2100, NASA predicts, climate change will cause seas to rise by 2 to 6 feet, largely because of the melting of ice in Antarctica and Greenland. The Thwaites Glacier has been melting due to a combination of warm air and water temperatures, caused at least partly by climate change, making it more unstable. Between the 1980s and 2017, it lost 600 billion tons of ice. As the oceans continue to warm, the glacier is expected to become more unmoored to land, increasing its risk of collapse. “Things are evolving really rapidly here,” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, said during Monday's news conference. “It’s daunting.” While it could take centuries for the full impact of a total collapse of the Thwaites Glacier to play out, the latest data from Antarctica is not giving scientists any reason for optimism. ”Each new satellite image we get, we see deeper and longer fractures,” Pettit said, adding, “What we’re seeing already is enough to be worried about. Thwaites is kind of a monster.”",Science/Yahoo News,"Antarctica's 'doomsday glacier' is facing threat of imminent collapse, scientists warn",https://news.yahoo.com/antarcticas-doomsday-glacier-is-facing-threat-of-imminent-collapse-scientists-warn-220236266.html
