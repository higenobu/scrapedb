Reports have surfaced that the U.S. Air Force’s “doomsday plane” was spotted running a brief training mission at the end of February. The mission ran for four hours and took place following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia’s nuclear forces were on high alert. The “doomsday plane” is a modified Boeing 747 built to withstand a nuclear war.

British news site iNews was the first to report on the spotting. The modified Boeing 747 was spotted taking off from a U.S. Air Force base in Nebraska. It then completed a four-and-a-half-hour flight towards the city of Chicago before landing once more. iNews also reports that the doomsday plane was accompanied by several early-warning jets during the training mission. The government renamed the plane to a Boeing E-4B following its modifications. It cost around $200 million to design. The doomsday plane is part of a group of aircraft known as the Nightwatch. The U.S. military has maintained the Nightwatch since the 1970s. The purpose of the doomsday plane is to serve as a moving command point in the event of nuclear war. Because it’s able to withstand a nuclear attack, the military could use it to command ground and air forces without the commanders being in one spot for too long. It’s unclear whether this training mission was a result of Putin’s recent threats or not. The U.S. government often runs training missions to ensure these planes are ready for anything. Considering there are six of these doomsday planes, it could just be coincidental timing to see the training mission run so close to Russia’s threat and its invasion of Ukraine. What’s most intriguing about the doomsday plane is its design. The plane is almost completely windowless. It features a special shielding designed to protect passengers from the thermal effects of nuclear weapons. Additionally, it can stay in the air for several days at a time and has the ability to refuel in flight. The government designed the doomsday plane during the Cold War. As such, it includes analog flight instruments. The older flight instruments are less likely to be fried by electromagnetic pulses released after a nuclear blast. Each plane has 67 different satellite dishes attached to it. This allows the team onboard to communicate with just about anyone, anywhere in the world. Of course, most of the doomsday plane’s real capabilities are classified. At least, that’s what reports say. What we do know is that each of these planes stands around six stories tall. Live Science says that they include six bathrooms, a galley, a briefing room, and 18 bunks for sleeping. The doomsday plane can also hold a crew of up to 112 members.

3/5/2022,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO will defend all its allies and territory against a Russian attack, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday, as he arrived for a meeting of the alliance's foreign ministers in Brussels. ""Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of NATO territory,"" he told reporters, while condemning what he called Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine. ""And overnight, we've also seen reports about the attack against a nuclear power plant. This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engaging in good faith in diplomatic efforts.""

3/5/2022,"Caltrans and construction crews have blasted away a massive rock that fell Thursday night onto Highway 50 near Echo Summit, but the cleanup will keep the mountain pass in El Dorado County closed for several more hours Friday as personnel move debris from the roadway. The slide was reported at 5:40 p.m., according to Caltrans District 3, and a boulder that fell was “the size of a semi,” according to CHP personnel who were dispatched to the scene. A photo posted by the transportation agency showed a continuous rock with flecks of snow — roughly 15 feet by 40 feet across — taking up the entire westbound lane and half of the eastbound side of the pass, which is a few miles from Sierra-at-Tahoe ski resort. Construction and road crews worked through the night to drill holes into the boulder before blasting the rock into manageable pieces just after 10 a.m. Motorists traveling on Highway 50 from the Nevada state line to Davis are being warned about the blockage. Westbound traffic is being turned around at the Meyers roundabout near South Lake Tahoe, and a hard closure is in effect eastbound at Sly Park. Motorists can use Highways 49, 88, 89 as alternates in the immediate area, the CHP and Caltrans said, or travel to the Sierra via Interstate 80.",U.S./Modesto Bee,Rock ‘the size of semi’ tumbles onto California highway.
