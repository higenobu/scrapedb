5/19/2022,"Dee Hilton already knows how she would like the end of her life to look. She imagines a glass of champagne with her siblings – “just a little bit for me” – time with her children and grandchildren – the ones who are “old enough to understand”. And then, at the end, it would just be her with her “wonderful” husband, Andrew. “And then I just go,” she says. “That’s what I want.” On Thursday, Hilton got the news she had been waiting for. After months of delays and following a mammoth late-night debate, New South Wales became the last state in Australia to pass voluntary assisted dying legislation. It means that she will have “the right to take my own life”. It has been six months since the bill passed the state’s lower house despite opposition from both the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the Labor leader, Chris Minns. Its passage just after 12.30pm on Thursday is a landmark moment in the state, and follows a long-running campaign from advocates who have pushed for NSW to follow the rest of the country in passing voluntary assisted dying laws. The bill was spearheaded by the independent MP Alex Greenwich with 28 co-sponsors last year after a series of failed past attempts. He said the bill marked a moment in which NSW “finally passed a threshold of honesty and compassion”. “Honesty that not all people die well, and compassion that people with advanced and cruel terminal illnesses will have the same end-of-care options as those in every other state,” he said.

The person must be found to have capacity to make the decision to go ahead voluntarily without duress, and the application would be assessed by two medical practitioners. Supporters had hoped the bill would pass on Wednesday night, but after a mammoth debate in which opponents moved some 90 amendments in a late-night filibuster attempt, it passed the upper house on Thursday afternoon. One of the bill’s opponents, the employee relations minister, Damien Tudehope, said the bill “betrayed” people suffering from a terminal illness. “Some will say this is a great moment for NSW,” he said. “I will leave here today thinking this is a dark day for our state.” But for Hilton, the bill’s passage will come as a relief. Five years ago the 76-year-old was diagnosed with a rare degenerative neurological disorder known as multi-system atrophy. It means that, in her words, “all the systems in my body are dying quicker than they normally should be”.

If she’s lucky, she says she may have three more years to live. But she understands that the disease which has robbed her of so much – sharing a bed with her husband, cooking for her family – is “going to get worse, it’s not going to get better”. “I don’t want to be hanging around” to find out what the worst looks like, she says. It could have been very different for her. Last year, she attempted to take her own life while her husband was out of the home. “He came home and found me, and was very distressed and very upset. I don’t want to have to go through things like that,” she said. “I just really want my husband to remember me as a person, not as somebody who’s pissing and shitting themselves. We used to have a beautiful king bed, now I am in a hospital bed. We can’t even sleep together on the same bed now.” The Dying with Dignity NSW president, Penny Hackett, called the bill’s passage “an historic moment for people in NSW”. “This bill will give an immense sense of hope and relief to many people with a terminal illness who simply want to take back some control at the end of their life. “All people want is to know that if they have a terminal illness that will cause prolonged suffering at the end of their life they will have the option to die a peaceful death.” NSW becomes the last state to pass voluntary assisted dying laws. Victoria passed what the premier, Daniel Andrews, described as the most conservative euthanasia regime in the world when it passed in 2017. Western Australia followed in 2019, before Queensland passed similar laws last year. For advocates, the next step becomes challenging the federal government to overturn Howard-era laws which prevented the Northern Territory and ACT from making their own laws on voluntary assisted dying, something Greenwich referred to after the bill passed. “It’s now for the federal parliament to give the territories the same ability to pass the same laws,” he said.

5/19/2022,"In the first week of this six-week election lead-up, our experts analysed Scott Morrison’s “stalker cam” ad. Next was the United Australia party’s sloshing sea of yellow, followed by Labor’s attack ads. Then it was the Greens doing Grindr, and the teals’ attempts to seal the deal. This week, as the campaign period draws to a close, we asked Dr Andrew Hughes, a political marketing lecturer at the Australian National University, and the University of Canberra’s Dr Chris Wallace, to talk about the best and the worst advertisements of this election. Both Wallace and Hughes swiftly picked the one they hated the most. The Coalition’s holey bucket. In the ad, released last week, a rusted bucket sits in a spotlight, with a faded Labor symbol on it. “There’s a hole in your budget, dear Labor, dear Labor,” the female narrator sings, then headlines flash on the screen warning of economic disaster under Labor. “More taxes are coming, more taxes, more taxes, there’s a hole in your budget, dear Labor, a hole.” The song finishes, and a male voice intones: “It won’t be easy under Albanese.” “Every time I hear it and see it I want to throw a rock at the television,” Wallace says. Hughes agrees: “It’s driven us all bonkers, because it’s been on ad nauseam, on whatever channel, and even on social media platforms. It’s getting traction for all the wrong reasons. “There’s a hole in people’s heads from it. Focus groups would have said, ‘Labor, our fear is they spend and tax big’ … That does not translate into a leaky bucket ad. It doesn’t take long to make a video these days, why not have the creative content out there?” He likens it to the government’s Covid ad that showed a woman in intensive care, gasping for air. It got attention, he says, but missed the mark. “They were targeting people who couldn’t get the vaccine,” he says. What ads were successful? Wallace says while she hates the bucket ad, unfortunately the song was an “ear worm”, whose “annoyingness makes it extremely memorable”. It reminded her of the “Whinging Wendy” Labor ads of 1987, she says, referring to ads featuring a woman looking down the barrel of the camera, asking John Howard what cuts he would make in office. “The repetitiveness is … so annoying but so effective,” she says. Wallace says one of the criticisms of Labor’s 2019 campaign in her book, How to Win an Election, was that the party did not put out a single memorable ad. “That’s true this campaign as well, and I think that’s a problem,” she says. “The conservative side of politics understands that it’s emotion that moves voters. On the progressive side of politics, people think if you test the facts and come up with a good policy, that’s it. They don’t understand that you have to harness emotions to win voters. “Labor still has not learned that. The whole advertising industry is built on that idea, that you win people and get them to do things using emotion not reason. If you’re not coming up with ads that move voters, that’s a failure of political craft.” Hughes also struggles to nominate an ad he actually likes, although he says the “teal” candidates resisted the urge to go low. “They rarely dipped their toes in anything negative,” he says. “It was a breath of fresh air … against these old, stuffy campaigns from both parties that are wholly negative. Look at the falling of the primary vote count. It’s [because of] negative campaigning.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He adds that he thinks Australians are sick of Clive Palmer’s United Australia party ads, and that people have told him they think the best ads came from a party they’d never consider voting for. “People said to me the Pauline Hanson cartoon series was the most convincing thing they saw all campaign,” he says. The broadcast media blackout kicked in on Wednesday night, which is expected to only increase the amount of social media advertising rolled out over the next few days.",News/Australia news,Hole in your budget: is the most annoying ad of the election also the most effective?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/hole-in-your-budget-is-the-most-annoying-ad-of-the-election-also-the-most-effective
5/19/2022,"Experts have denounced a “totally misleading” claim perpetuated by government MPs and the United Australia party that the World Health Organization will use a possible pandemic treaty to control Australia’s health system, including to arbitrarily impose lockdowns. Political parties and candidates, as of Wednesday, are barred from running election ads on broadcast mediums but not on social media and in print, an inequity that experts have repeatedly urged government to fix. The United Australia party ran full-page print ads on Thursday baselessly claiming the major parties were planning to transfer “all our health assets and hospitals to the Chinese-controlled WHO”. It continues a theme perpetuated by government senator Alex Antic, who posted on Facebook this week that the WHO was preparing a pandemic treaty which could allow it to impose “lockdowns and enforce treatments against the will of the Australian people”. Fellow government senator Gerard Rennick shared a letter Antic penned to foreign affairs minister Marise Payne about the topic. The claim that the WHO would seize total control of the health systems of individual nation-states has also been propagated by US senator Marco Rubio and comedian Russell Brand, among others. The theory appears to stem from the WHO’s plans to discuss a possible pandemic treaty at its upcoming 75th World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, from 22 May. In a joint statement on the proposed agreement, a collection of world leaders said any treaty would hope to improve pandemic response coordination and preparedness, while fostering accountability and transparency from participating governments. “This includes greatly enhancing international co-operation to improve, for example, alert systems, data-sharing, research and local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment,” the statement said. Neither China nor Australia signed the joint statement in support of the proposal. Stephen Duckett, a former health department secretary and expert with the University of Melbourne, told the Guardian the recent claims about the treaty completely misunderstood its purpose. “It’s totally misleading, of course,” he said. “There are already treaty arrangements of this kind covering tobacco and it leaves total autonomy with each country … it’s typically framework arrangements and to try and bring consensus and so on. “It would obviously only apply to Australia to the extent that Australia wants it to.” Antic declined to respond to criticisms about his post, instead, he attacked the Guardian, claiming it was politically biased. A ban on broadcast election advertising came into force late on Wednesday, preventing election ads from airing on television and radio until the close of polls on Saturday. The blackout does not apply to social media or newspapers and experts have repeatedly warned the government that the rules are out of date and must be reformed. After the 2019 election, the University of Canberra’s News and Media Research Centre told the joint standing committee on electoral matters that extending the blackout to social media could “mitigate the influence on voting of some of the risk of online ‘scare campaigns’ and unverified news in the final hours of the campaign”. The committee found the rules were “no longer fit for purpose” and recommended, as it did in 2013, that the government reform its blackout rules. No changes were made during the last term of government. Dr Andrew Hughes, a marketing expert with the Australian National University, said the broadcast blackout no longer made sense, and only amplified messaging via social media, where misinformation was rife. “It is 2022. The blackout is silly, to be honest with you – in the current form that is,” he said. “I’d say, at the same time, it opens the door up for misinformation campaigns to be run.” Hughes said the blackout rules need reform. He said the blackout could be extended to prevent any advertising from parties and candidates, regardless of the medium. “You won’t stop all the content, you’ll just slow it down. And then it’s on the individuals and because it’s not paid or promoted [on social media], it’ll take away the effectiveness a lot.” Antic’s post was not an ad, so would not be captured by any extension of the blackout.",News/Australia news,United Australia party and Coalition MPs denounced for ‘totally misleading’ claim about WHO,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/united-australia-party-and-coalition-mps-denounced-for-totally-misleading-claim-about-who
