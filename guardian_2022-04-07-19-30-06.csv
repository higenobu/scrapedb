4/7/2022,"Tucked beneath the headlines on Covid and Ukraine, the most important climate legislation in US history – and thus, arguably, in world history – is still stuck in congressional purgatory. You’d be forgiven if you weren’t fully aware. It is not trending on Twitter. Joe Biden has mostly stopped talking about it. The enormous moral stakes have been brutally ablated by a broken, farcical and, above all, extremely boring legislative kludge known as budget reconciliation. The months-long saga has turned Biden’s original “Build Back Better” plan into the juridical equivalent of a Warhol soup can – a ubiquitous token evacuated of any original meaning. That the public has largely failed to track the implications of this process is an indictment of the way climate information gets filtered down to ordinary people: in dollar figures no one understands, in line graphs published by obscure wonks on Twitter, in front-page headlines that exhaust the emotive potential of journalistic prose. Connecting any of this to, for example, insurance premiums in Miami Beach, or the fate of the world’s remaining sea turtles, or the prospect of your own grandchildren spending the bulk of their crypto-wages on potable drinking water, requires an almost mimetic leap of imagination. And yet, the stakes remain what they are. Passage of the bill’s half-trillion-dollars-worth of clean energy investments would probably spell the difference between the world’s largest economy meeting its climate goals and blowing right past them. It is not an exaggeration to say that in that balance – between 2C and 3C of warming, between a government responsive to and avoidant of the greatest crisis of the 21st century – hang millions of human lives. The potential impact rivals that of nuclear war, except in this case the default is catastrophe. The fossil fuel industry has already fired its ICBM at the heart of our coastal cities. It’s up to the Democrats now to turn it around. And turn it around they still might. Joe Manchin, of his own volition, has returned to the bargaining table with a proposal that could retain most of the original climate investments from Build Back Better and potentially leave room for some investment in low-emission home and healthcare work. Biden and Schumer must stop at nothing to hold him to his word and land the deal. If they do, they could reverse the narrative of Biden’s presidency overnight. Not only would Biden finally be able to declare victory on his signature policy agenda, he would be offering a direct rejoinder to the crisis in Ukraine, pointing global energy markets toward wind and solar and undercutting fossil-fueled autocrats like Vladimir Putin. For a war-time president, the combination of crisis-response and long-term vision would earn him a place next to Churchill in the history textbooks. I want to pause here, though, to express my absolute, stupefying outrage that it’s come to this. That not a single one of the Republican cowards who claim concern over climate change – Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham – is even considering voting for the bill. That its fate will be determined by a man who makes money hand over fist pumping carbon into the atmosphere. That Biden had to dispatch the head of the National Economic Council to go zip-lining with Manchin in West Virginia last weekend. That the fate of organized human civilization would at least partially depend on two grown men donning intricate safety harnesses and skimming across a river gorge (though I’ll admit that, compared with your typical round of golf, there was something weird and almost endearing about this particular political mating ritual). All of which is to say: I won’t let my indignation die. I won’t succumb to the Stockholm syndrome of the Beltway pundit, who would tell my generation that this is just how Washington works. The point is that Washington doesn’t work. Washington is broken. This process is proof. But to refuse cynicism is not to refuse strategy. That’s why, on 23 April, thousands of people will be showing up in front of the White House – and in key Senate swing states – to make one last play at redemption. That’s why, to be blunt, you should really join them. Democrats still have a chance to make good on their slogan and deliver on climate. If they fail, we’ll lose far, far more than the midterms. We cannot allow them to fail.

4/7/2022,"Boris Johnson’s new energy strategy could take up to five years to start shaving money off people’s bills, the business secretary has admitted, as the prime minister announced a drastic expansion of nuclear reactors. Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan for cutting reliance on imported energy in the wake of spiralling prices caused in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was more of a medium-term way to ramp up homegrown energy production. Johnson declared that the long-delayed energy security strategy meant “nuclear is coming home” – but the review declined to set targets for onshore wind and committed to continuing the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. Days after 22 million people were hit by the energy price cap rising by 54%, Kwarteng suggested it would be years until the benefits of the strategy would be felt by consumers. “The strategy is more of a medium-term three, four, five-year answer,” the business secretary told Sky News. “I think it’s really important that we get an energy strategy that means we can have more security and independence in the years ahead. “We want to have security of supply, we want to live in a world where we’re not dependent on what Russian policy is, but we have more control over energy sources here in Britain.” The cost of offshore wind had decreased enormously in the past 10 years, Kwarteng said, adding: “Some of these benefits can happen quite quickly. But we need to start the planning process and the strategy now. And that’s what this security strategy is all about.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, attempted to intervene in the cost of living crisis at the end of March, but was accused of not doing enough to help struggling households expected to face the biggest fall in living standards since modern records began in the 1950s. At the heart of this week’s energy strategy was nuclear, and a commitment by the government to more than triple the amount of nuclear energy generated so that 25% of all Britain’s electricity comes from atomic energy. In a social media video to promote the strategy, Johnson said: “In the country that was the first to split the atom, the first truly to harness its power to light our homes and drive our factories, we will once again lead the way. “Nuclear is coming home. So instead of a new reactor every decade we will have a new reactor every year. “For years, governments have dodged the big decisions on energy, but not this one. We’ve got the ambition, we’ve got the plan and we are going to bring clean, affordable secure power to the people for generations to come.” Labour accused Johnson and Kwarteng of being “too weak” to follow through on their previously planned hopes to drastically increase the amount of onshore wind production because of hostility from Tory backbenchers. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said a significant majority of people supported onshore wind Pat McFadden, the shadow Treasury chief secretary, also said Kwarteng’s comments about the time it would take for the energy strategy to start to bring down energy bills showed the government had “no plan to immediately address their cost of living crisis”. He reiterated Labour’s call for a one-off windfall tax on “the booming profits of oil and gas giants – which would reduce household bills by up to £600”.",Lifestyle/Money,"UK’s energy strategy may take years to bring down bills, says Kwarteng",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/07/uk-energy-strategy-may-take-years-to-bring-down-bills-says-kwarteng
4/7/2022,"In the second half of James Baldwin’s seminal novel Giovanni’s Room, the narrator spots a sailor dressed all in white striding across a boulevard in Paris. He looks at him with a longing he doesn’t quite understand. The sailor reminds him of home, he realises, before making the following observation: “Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.” Chitra Ramaswamy invokes Baldwin at the start of her new book, Homelands. In it, she explores how a place becomes a home, what makes a family put down roots, and how hatred can tear them out. She does so by deftly interweaving her own life story with that of the 97-year-old Holocaust survivor she befriends, Henry Wuga. They are, superficially, an unlikely pair: one born in 1970s Britain to Indian immigrant parents; the other a refugee from Nazi Germany who arrived on the Kindertransport in 1939. Ramaswamy, a journalist, first met Wuga in 2011, when her editor sent her to interview him and his wife in the run-up to Refugee Week. She found herself back again within a few weeks, this time on a social call – the first of many. Wuga, a keen skier, tells her of the time he met Prince Charles standing in a queue for a ski lift in the village of Klosters, Switzerland. When asked by the heir to the British throne where he came from, Henry, who has a German accent, answered “Glasgow”. He was pressed further, of course; Ramaswamy notes that the older she gets, the more she realises there is no answer to this question capable of satisfying everyone. Wuga’s bewildering journey takes him from Nuremberg, Germany, where he lived as a child, to Britain on the train that saved him – and 10,000 other Jewish children – from annihilation. “I remember the horror,” he tells Ramaswamy, “I was older, but many of these kids were six and seven years old. They had never left their mums and dads. I tell this story a lot. It never gets … it was the howling of the children. Carriages full of screaming children.” He arrived in Glasgow on 5 May 1939, where his sponsor was waiting for him, and bounced into his new existence in the way only children can. But his life changed once again at the outbreak of war. Shortly after turning 16, Wuga was found guilty of corresponding with the enemy, simply for writing to his parents and other family members in Europe. The account of his internment in six different camps is the most gripping part of Homelands, shedding light on a particularly dark period in the history of Britain’s treatment of refugees. It is a cliche to describe a book as achingly beautiful, but those are the words I reach for: Homelands is both beautiful and, at times, left me with an ache I struggled to name. Ramaswamy’s prose is at its most visceral when she writes of her grief at her mother’s death. At the hospital, the junior doctor and her mother speak in their native Kannada, and Ramaswamy sees her “magically transform” into her first self, her Indian self. “She seems not only to be dying but going home. And in every possible way I cannot follow her.”The narrative, which shifts between past and present, Ramaswamy and Wuga’s stories, sometimes feels stretched too thinly. It relies heavily on WG Sebald’s Austerlitz, the novel about a Kindertransport survivor who tries to recapture the truth of his shattered childhood. It is a haunting work, which Ramaswamy reads “obsessively” and turns to whenever she feels lost. But the references to it feel like an unnecessary distraction. The remarkably self-assured material that forms the backbone of the book is able to stand on its own. On the question of home and belonging, Ramaswamy finally comes to an answer that satisfies her, and the reader. “In the future I will start to understand that belonging lies in the search. That disorientation is the true birthplace of millions of us.” It is clear by the end that her search has also uncovered something more solid, since Ramaswamy and Wuga have found each other.

The oranges represented the rolling away of the stone of Christ’s tomb and anyone who caught one would have a long – or even a second – life, according to folklore.

4/7/2022,"‘Fuck this world music, this racist term. This is a rock band,” Mikey Coltun told Wire magazine in February. Coltun, bassist in Mdou Moctar’s backing trio, was right. Anyone inclined to take Nigerien guitarist Moctar or his band at face value will be disabused of the “world music” notion as soon as they start to play. In calf-length Tuareg robes and turban-like white tagelmusts, they passionately shred and lock into psychedelic grooves. Singing in the Tuareg language Tamasheq, Moctar rewrites the guitar-hero rulebook: lesson one is that surging guitar music marinated in the African/American folk fusion known as desert blues is rock. Ostensibly here to promote the resoundingly praised current album, Afrique Victime, Moctar – “the Hendrix of the Sahara”, as he’s been tagged – is the type who needs no excuse to unpack his white left-handed Stratocaster and play. In an inversion of the usual rock star entrance, the 38-year-old even arrives on stage before his band, who amble on a few minutes later. The four are quickly immersed in the 2017 track Amidini, which proceeds from delicately finger-picked opening bars to psych-drone. Next, Kamane Tarhanin explains the many comparisons to Eddie Van Halen. New Yorker Coltun, the lone American in the group, has said that moshpits and crowd-surfing often break out at their shows, and we find out why: when Moctar slides into a melodic pattern and the others fall in step with him, creating layer on thrusting layer of noise at stunning speed, the urge to hurl yourself at another person arises. Packed in shoulder-to-shoulder, tonight’s crowd have to make do with vigorous body-shaking. Moctar, who doesn’t interrupt the flow by speaking to the audience, is a striking figure. A head taller than Coltun, rhythm guitarist Ahmoudou Madassane and a drummer, Souleymane Ibrahim, who redefines the word “powerhouse”, Moctar nods along to the beat while otherwise remaining impassive. Not even the political urgency of the show-closing song, Afrique Victime, which excoriates former colonial ruler France for leaving Niger impoverished, induces a change of expression. Moctar just lets his thrilling music do the talking.  At Hare and Hounds, Birmingham, 7 April.

4/7/2022,"Labor’s candidate for the hotly contested federal seat of Hughes in Sydney has withdrawn over section 44 citizenship concerns, leaving the ALP scrambling to find a replacement just days before the election is likely to be called. Peter Tsambalas, a local teacher, was preselected unopposed by ALP branch members in January. But he had not been officially endorsed as he was waiting for notification from Greek authorities that he had officially renounced his Greek citizenship. He began the process in December 2021. Despite being born in Australia and having Australian citizenship, Tsambalas acquired dual citizenship via his migrant parents. This is sufficient to trigger section 44 of the constitution which says a person is ineligible to run for federal parliament if they are “under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power”. “My team and I put every effort into resolving the citizenship question but it is clear we will not get there in time,” Tsambalas said on Thursday. “I want to thank all those who have supported me to this point. We spent several months working hard on the campaign and I believe I would have taken the fight up well in Hughes. “However, I now look forward to giving whatever assistance I can to the successful Labor candidate in this important election.” The seat of Hughes in Sydney’s south is currently held by former Liberal Craig Kelly with a 9.3% margin. Kelly resigned from the Liberal party over controversial views on Covid-19 and vaccination. Usually, Hughes would be a safe seat for the Liberals, but Kelly’s decision to run for the United Australia party, combined with the turmoil among the Liberals over preselections, has made it highly unpredictable. There are also two community independent candidates running – Georgia Steele and Linda Seymour. Both sides of politics acknowledge that section 44 poses a significant impediment for candidates who come from a multicultural background. It often requires careful analysis of citizen laws of another country and applications to foreign governments to renounce any rights to citizenship. However, changing section 44 would require a referendum and no steps have yet been taken to achieve that change. In Wentworth, the independent candidate Allegra Spender has had to give up her Italian citizenship acquired via her late mother – the fashion designer Carla Zampatti. She has publicly lamented it is one of the sacrifices she has had to make to run for parliament. A spokesperson for her campaign confirmed she was no longer an Italian citizen. Tsambalas is the first casualty of section 44 in this election campaign but may not be the last. On Saturday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced nine candidates he had handpicked to run in seats in the May election. Many are from multicultural backgrounds. A spokesperson for the NSW Liberals said the process was well underway to ensure their eligibility. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Section 44 triggered an eligibility crisis in federal parliament in 2017. Six senators and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, were referred to the high court between August and September that year. In October 2017, the high court ruled that five were ineligible to be elected being dual citizens at the time of nomination. In November 2017, three more senators resigned after recognising their dual citizenship. Joyce and John Alexander returned to the lower house after rectifying their citizenship status and winning byelections. The high court ruled that a candidate must take reasonable steps to renounce any dual citizenship.",News/Australia news,Section 44 strikes again: Labor candidate for Hughes quits race due to Greek citizenship concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/section-44-strikes-again-labor-candidate-for-hughes-quits-race-due-to-greek-citizenship-concerns
4/7/2022,"Hip-hop pioneer Kidd Creole has been found guilty of first-degree manslaughter for stabbing a homeless man in 2017. The musician, real name Nathaniel Glover, 62, was an original member of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five alongside his brother Melle Mel, AKA Melvin Glover. (He is not associated with Kid Creole and the Coconuts, the band led by August Darnell.) On 1 August 2017, he had a run-in with a 55-year-old homeless man named John Jolly, whom he believed was attempting to solicit him for sex. Glover stabbed Jolly, who later died in hospital. When he was arrested the day after the assault on a charge of second-degree murder, Glover admitted to the attack during a videotaped police interview, although he was unaware at the time of Jolly’s death. “To tell the truth, I thought he was gay and because I thought he was gay, and he was saying that to me, ‘what’s up,’ I was thinking that he was thinking I was gay,” Glover told police. “So I was a little annoyed by that. “He approached me. I got a little nervous. So then I tried to back up a little bit, and he moved forward, and then I just took the knife and stabbed him … I wish I never would have seen him. It’s all my fault, because I chose to stab him. I have to take responsibility for that.” Prosecutors alleged that Glover’s motives were homophobic. His lawyers said he stabbed Jolly out of fear and argued that Jolly’s medical records did not support the allegation that he had died of a stab wound, and claimed that a combination of alcohol and hospital-administered sedatives had in fact contributed to Jolly’s death. A Manhattan jury came to the guilty verdict within hours of lawyers on both sides presenting their closing arguments, Rolling Stone reports. Glover will be sentenced on 4 May and faces a maximum of 25 years in prison. He had previously been working as a handyman and security guard in Manhattan.",Arts/Music,Kidd Creole: hip-hop pioneer found guilty of first-degree manslaughter,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/07/kidd-creole-hip-hop-pioneer-found-guilty-of-first-degree-manslaughter-grandmaster-flash
4/7/2022,"The AntidoteWidely available, episodes weeklyTwo of the writers of HBO’s Insecure, Amy Aniobi and Grace Edwards – who are also best friends in real life – attempt to inject joy into the “dumpster fire” that is modern life. It’s an enjoyably chatty peek at life’s pleasures, from musing on the meditative joys of flower arranging or hikes in nature to pleasingly sweary moments of excitement (notably, exclaiming “You are objectively fine as fuck” in an interview with Black-ish actor Tracee Ellis Ross).

I love that its hosted by these three agony aunts/friends [Tolani Shoneye AKA Tolly T, Milena Sanchez and Audrey Indome] who have such a close bond. The titles are almost as good as the episodes, too – who wouldn’t be intrigued by “my dad is being catfished”?! This week, Ammar Kalia chooses the best audio dramas for scripted podcast fans, from spooky small-town goings-on to a historical blockbuster starring Rosamund Pike EdithScripted dramas can often seem like an excuse for audio production companies to stuff their new releases with celebrity names, rather than strong ideas and robust scriptwriting. Podcast network QCode has become something of a specialist in this celeb audio drama industry – with mixed results – but Edith, released last year, is one of their finest offerings, its high-profile casting matching the grandiosity of the script. Starring Rosamund Pike as Edith Wilson, the series recounts how she secretly took over from her incapacitated husband, US President Woodrow Wilson, in 1919 after he suffered a stroke. Mixing high stakes with farce – and a delightful American accent from Pike – the result is a wry take on the historical machinations of power.Welcome to Night ValeArguably the first massively popular scripted drama podcast to kick the entire craze off, this fictional radio show reporting on the eerie goings-on in a small US town kicked off in 2012 and has since run to over 200 episodes. Following in the footsteps of other early scripted podcast hits like Limetown, a TV adaptation is also currently in the works, while new episodes of the podcast are available twice a month. Start with episode 13 – a meta-narrative which takes you, the listener, as its mysterious subject. 36 QuestionsThis three-part 2017 creation from Chris Littler and Ellen Winter is a delightfully experimental journey into an estranged couple’s faltering relationship, told through song. Spring Awakening’s Jonathan Groff and Jessie Shelton star as the pair, trying to reconnect through 36 Questions That Lead to Love: a psychological survey designed to encourage intimacy. The couple record themselves in the form of a confessional, creating a tightly structured narrative that is delivered with gusto by Groff and Shelton. The 13 songs in 36 Questions prove that podcasting has ample scrope to explore and play with musical conventions. Here Lies MeFor fans of coming-of-age teenage tales like Pen15 and Big Mouth, writer Hillary Frank’s 2021 podcast Here Lies Me is essential listening. Tackling the particularly thorny age of eighth grade (13 to 14 years old), Frank’s YA narrative follows 13-year-old Noa as she navigates crushes, rivalries and changing friendships. Here Lies Me’s strengths lie in the casting of actual teenagers in its various roles – particularly Ollie Grishaber as Noa – as well as Frank’s willingness not to shy away from difficult topics such as sexual consent and racism. MoonfaceWith shades of writer Ocean Vuong’s poetic realism, James Kim’s emotively nuanced 2019 series tells the story of Korean American Paul (Joel Kim Booster) and his attempts to come out to his mother, despite the fact that her English is shaky and his Korean is minimal. Concerned with the frictions of misunderstanding as much as it is with meaning, Kim’s script harnesses the silences between words throughout its brisk six episodes. Rather than relying on polished scripts, Moonface gives us a taste of authentically strained communication between a mother and son, and a listening experience that is quietly thought-provoking.
