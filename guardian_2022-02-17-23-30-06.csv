2/17/2022,"A Tory MP who leads a group which campaigns against the government’s net zero measures has recruited two members of staff from a controversial organisation that questions climate science. After the Guardian revealed links between members of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, run by Craig Mackinlay MP, and the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), further ties between the two organisations have been found.  Politico reports that Mackinlay, an outspoken critic of the government’s Net Zero policies, has taken on Harry Wilkinson, the head of policy at GWPF’s campaigning arm Net Zero Watch, in addition to Ruth Lea, a former trustee of the group, to work in his parliamentary office. Wilkinson is an outspoken critic of consensus on global heating, and has tweeted: “The ‘climate crisis’ is a religious belief, nothing to do with science.” He previously worked for Nigel Lawson, who founded the GWPF and makes claims such as: “I think that climate change is not a threat, it is happening very gently at a fraction of a degree per decade which is something we can perfectly well live with.” The lobbyist celebrated the news of his new appointment, tweeting: “After 5 years of working as a Researcher for Lord Lawson, I am pleased to be able to take a position in Craig Mackinlay’s office. I look forward to supporting his work alongside continuing my role with Net Zero Watch.” Green campaigners have frequently called the GWPF a leading source of climate change denial, as it has questioned climate research by top scientists, called for green measures to be halted, and claimed rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has many benefits. Mackinlay confirmed the additions to his team, adding that Lea, who will be working unpaid, has had a parliamentary pass through association with his office since 2016, but that she has primarily worked with him on Brexit. He told Politico her work with Net Zero Watch “was wholly unconnected to her original appointment with me and is not related to her continuation as a passholder now. She is largely retired these days and she comes to parliament infrequently.” The MP for South Thanet added Wilkinson’s continuing employment with Net Zero Watch “is fully disclosed according to parliamentary rules applying to MPs’ employees and his depth of knowledge acquired there is invaluable to my interest and work on net zero issues”. The Net Zero Scrutiny Group of 19 Tory politicians has been accused of attempting to derail the government’s green agenda, linking it to the cost of living crisis and leading to fears of a “culture war” campaign around net zero. They have recently called for fracking and criticised the government’s plans to decarbonise industry, as well as shedding doubt on plans to phase out diesel and petrol cars in favour of electric. The group claims it does not contest the reality of climate change, merely the costs of net zero.",News/Environment,Tory behind attacks on net zero recruits two staffers from climate denial group,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/tory-attacks-net-zero-recruits-two-staffers-climate-denial-group-craig-mackinlay
2/17/2022,"On 31 January, the daily Tribune de Genève announced that four of Geneva’s best-known characters had suddenly been orphaned by the death of their maker, John Aldus, at the age of 81. These figures – a pair of art collectors, a poet and a pretty young woman, name unknown – were not actual Genevois but life-size, hyper-realist bronze sculptures of them, mingling with other burghers in the city’s Plainpalais Square. Placed there in 1982, they were collectively titled Alter Ego – Aldus was one such himself, the artist having for five decades been known by his birth name, Gérald John Ducimetière.  The Alter Ego figures remain Aldus’s best-known works, but they are easily misread. The quartet of bronzes are not public sculpture in any usual sense of the term: their purpose is not to memorialise or decorate, but to use familiarity to make space unfamiliar. If one word can be applied to the broad range of Aldus’s art-making – drawing, printing, film et al – then that word is probably “uncanny”. His 1974 video piece, La Blessure (Wound), showed a woodsman’s axe hacked into the floor of Geneva’s venerable Musée Rath; in the photo series, Matterhorn (1975), the Swiss art collector André L’Huillier – one of the characters in Alter Ego – spoons a chocolate replica of the titular mountain into his mouth. These early Swiss works often featured Aldus himself, a Byronic figure with a dark beard. The video Poisson shows him ruminating, for 13 seconds, on the question of why fishermen, demonstrating the size of a catch, do so palms-in rather than palms-out. In a 1975 interview, citing Plato, Aldus ruminated on beauty. “In nature,” he says, “nothing is beautiful or ugly. Man’s obsession with beauty is driven by the knowledge that only we are capable of producing ugliness.” This view, and its classical underpinnings, was typical of Aldus. If his background in the Genevan suburb of Veyrier was hardly intellectual – his father, Albert, worked in a factory, his mother, Lucie (nee Poitry), was a concierge – the young Ducimetière proved prodigiously bright. Locally schooled, he won a place at the Écoles des Arts Décoratifs and Beaux-Arts in Geneva, graduating in 1961 with the Prix Pierre Cailler. More prizes followed, with federal grants to match. As a student, he had visited Salvador Dalí in Cadaqués, and his work would retain a strong tinge of the surreal. In 1995 he changed his birth name, Gérald John Ducimetière, to John Aldus. “Ducimetière” means “of the cemetery” in French. Perhaps with resurrection in mind, the artist jettisoned his first forename for his second, conflating the last letters of “Gérald” with the first of “Ducimetière” to become John Aldus. (The surname was also chosen to honour the company whose eponymous graphic software Ducimetière liked to use, swallowed up that same year by Adobe.) The following year he moved to London; perhaps, like his familiarly unfamiliar Alter Ego characters, the point was to flirt with displacement. The works Aldus made in London were as thoughtful, and thought-provoking, as his Swiss work had been. His light sculpture, Lykeios (2000), punned in French and classical Greek. The building in whose turrets the piece was installed was called the Lycée, the word deriving from the Athenian temple of Apollo Lykeios where Aristotle had taught. Aldus’s British masterpiece, Tokens (2006), commissioned by Camden council, saw him embedding copies of the fragments attached as identifiers by 18th-century mothers to the clothes of the babies they abandoned at London’s Foundling hospital into the pavement of nearby Marchmont Street. As often in Aldus’s work, the experience of space in the piece becomes an experience of time. Tokens also recalled the artist’s own, more fortunate birth. “I had nine months in my mother’s womb and I became an artist,” Aldus said. “That’s all.” As to his own displacement, moving to London made him happy. Living and working in a studio in Hampstead, Aldus drove most days to an arts club in Chelsea where, book in hand, he would sit by himself, bespectacled and lost in thought. Aldus married Isabelle Braillard in 1986; they later divorced. He is survived by their daughter, Noémie.

2/17/2022,"The haunting strains of Ravel’s Bolero rang out across Capital Indoor Stadium, but for once Kamila Valieva was unable to weave her spell. The 15-year-old Russian is widely recognised as the greatest figure skater in history, but with Olympic glory on the line, the trials and tumult of the past week caught up with her over the longest four minutes and 20 seconds of her life.  The initial signs were not encouraging as she under-rotated on her first element, the quad salchow. But having then landed a triple axel, Valieva’s routine suddenly fell apart with two heavy falls – first on a quad toe loop and triple toe loop combination, and then again on another quad toe loop combination. The crowd clapped and tried to rally her. And rally she did. But the damage had been done. And despite leading after Tuesday’s short programme, Valieva’s performance in Thursday’s free programme dropped her down to fourth with an overall score of 224.09. For minutes afterwards sat in the kiss and cry booth, unable to comprehend what had happened. She was not the only one. It was an extraordinary conclusion to a remarkable competition, which was won by Valieva’s teammate Anna Shcherbakova of the Russian Olympic Committee, with another Russian, Alexandra Trusova, taking second and the Japanese skater Kaori Sakamoto finishing third. For Valieva there is just intense frustration and months of limbo while her positive test for trimetazidine, a drug typically described for patients suffering from angina, is resolved in the courts. However she might still get a team medal. Hours before the astonishing finale of the single skating competition, the president of the Russian Olympic Committee promised to fight any efforts to take his country’s gold medal in the team competition, even if Valieva was eventually disqualified for doping. ROC president Stanislav Pozdnyakov insisted that the anti-doping rules were written in such a way that a review of results in a team event would only take place if the alleged anti-doping violation had been committed during the Olympic Games. “We will defend this position consistently in any possible proceedings, including in the court of arbitration for sport if required,” he said.",Sport/Sport,Kamila Valieva’s Olympic dream falls apart as Anna Shcherbakova wins gold,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/kamila-valieva-anna-shcherbakova-winter-olympics-beijing-figure-skating
2/17/2022,"Commuters and long-haul travellers at London’s St Pancras International station will be offered something different this International Women’s Day: the chance to pause, reflect and enjoy a moment of art and connection in an unlikely place. On 8 March the station will become a stage for a series of brand-new, train-themed micro-operas created by teams of female composers and librettists.  These include Laura Reid and Oge Nwosu’s poetic song Detritus, which will be performed at the National Rail service departure boards and is told through the eyes of a cleaner who reunites people with their lost items. And against the backdrop of the station’s iconic statue The Meeting Place, Sarah Lianne Lewis and Sophia Chapadjiev’s The Parting Place will tell the tale of an elusive voyeur, while Joanna Taylor and Kerry Priest’s I Just Wanna Be (in Center Parcs) will explore journeys beyond the every day. Each newly commissioned piece has been built on anecdotes submitted to the Royal Opera House by members of the public, exploring themes of time, motion, meetings and farewells. The female composer and librettist duos were selected after an open call from the ROH’s Jette Parker Young Artists Programme (JPYA). The series, called Lost and Found, also includes Victoria Bernarth and Teresa Howard’s Mini Break, a comic opera about the panic of lost passports and the inevitable bickering that follows, as well as Anna Braithwaite and Priests’ The Hardest Journey, about hidden disabilities. The event is part of the Europalia Arts Festival, which involves European railway stations including Antwerp, Brussels and Rotterdam central stations. Some of the writing teams were mentored by the award-winning composer Laura Bowler, whose new work The Blue Woman will premiere at the ROH this summer. Singers include the Jette Parker Young artists April Koyejo-Audiger, Thando Mjandana, Chuma Sijeqa, Blaise Malaba and Egor Zhuravskii, joined by Siân Dicker, Milly Forrest, Njabulo Madlala, Sam Marston, Zahid Siddiqui and Jamie Woollard. Accompanying them will be players from the Belgium chamber ensemble Casco Phil, whose artistic director Benjamin Haemhouts devised the project. Angelique MacDonald, producer for the JPYA, said: “It has been a privilege to read the personal stories that were shared with us for this project, and watch them inspire seven new works in different styles and approaches. Opera is an innately human art form and it’s hugely exciting to be able to perform such relatable work with Caso Phil at St Pancras International.” Wendy Spinks, commercial director at HS1, said: “We are so excited for St Pancras International to be the backdrop for the latest Lost and Found performances, straight off the Eurostar. There will no doubt be many interesting and entertaining stories from travellers who pass through train stations, and we can’t wait to see them brought to life through the magic and beauty of opera.”",News/World news,St Pancras station to become an opera hall for International Women’s Day,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/st-pancras-station-to-become-an-opera-hall-for-international-womens-day
2/17/2022,"Ivan Michael Blackstock never stops moving. For the best part of an hour, the choreographer has been patiently explaining his approach to dance, a process that involves springing up from the balls of his feet and gesticulating in time with an imagined rhythm, despite the fact he is seated. “Whether I’m thinking about a performance or making music or picking up a paintbrush – that’s dancing,” he says. “That’s the first gear: the thing through which everything else flows.” Having worked on Beyoncé’s visual album Black Is King, a journey through Black identity and the global African diaspora, his new show, Traplord, casts the streets of south London as the perfect stage to explore the stereotyping of Black men in western society.  “When we see street culture and the imagery on TV around young Black men, it’s very violent and aggressive, and yes, there is some of that, but then there’s also a good,” he says. “You can see drill music as one thing – an expression of violence – but it’s people channelling their pain into doing something creative. Just because you live in this community and express yourself loudly, doesn’t mean you’re being aggressive.” An immersive dance performance, Traplord blends theatre, hip-hop and spoken word in its meditation on Black masculinity and mental health. “I’m proud to have worked on Black Is King: it was filmed here and it was a real chance to wave the flag for UK artists. But Traplord feels different: it’s Ivan this time. This is a story that has always felt present in me.” Although he repeatedly describes the process of bringing Traplord to the stage as “therapeutic” and a “great relief”, he says he is interested, above all, in “looking outside my pain”. “Within Traplord there’s a lot of utopic ideas. It’s something I learned from hip-hop, really: ‘What messages are you passing down to the community?’” Blackstock, 35, grew up in Peckham, with his mother, sister and brother, before crossing south London at 15 to live with his grandmother in Brixton. He felt the absence of his father keenly throughout his childhood and the spectre of abandonment hovers over his work; it is the key stumbling block in the hero’s journey in Traplord. “I was abandoned; I felt alone without that father figure in my life, so yeah, I do feel somewhat like I need to be a father, not just to myself, but to other young men.” From a young age, Blackstock channelled that unease into dance. “I’ve been choreographing since I was on the playground in primary,” he says. But the transition to secondary school came with a new self-consciousness that made him doubt his passion. After winning the schoola talent show with an MTV Base-inspired rendition of Usher’s My Way, Blackstock became a target for bullies. “They were like: we spit; we rap. But I was always moving and expressing my ideas through my body.” He describes his life through this period as “like a movie” (when pressed he offers Boyz N the Hood or Brotherhood as examples). At 15, leaving his home meant navigating groups of young men who would hassle him, threatening him with violence and cautioning him not to stray into their territory. “I felt trapped in my environment,” he says, suggesting that his race only added to the intensity of his claustrophobia. Aged 11, he was stopped by police in Elephant and Castle, south London, because he “fit the description” for a bank robbery. “It made me feel powerless. When you’re going through adolescence, there’s a lot of things happening: your body’s changing, you’re trying to find your voice and assert your masculinity; where do I fit in the world?” The answer came through dance. Blackstock left school without any GCSEs (his inability to sit still was no help in the classroom) but was booked as a dancer on MTV shortly after. He followed his passion from there, most pertinently through the hip-hop dance company BirdGang, which he likens to “finding a family”. The group’s breakthrough came in 2006, with a performance of its show What Is BirdGang? at Sadler’s Wells, co-producer of Traplord along with 180 Studios, where Blackstock is the artistic director. “I’ve been a fan of Sadler’s Wells since I was a kid. You know, dreaming one day that my work will be on that stage? BirdGang was like this flock flying together on the same mission and getting the chance to perform there felt like discovering my superhero alter ego.” Even though he is no longer with the company, he says BirdGang is still his family: “I was best man at one of the artistic directors’ weddings.” Gigs as a backing dancer for Kylie Minogue and Dizzee Rascal followed, but it was touring Asia, as a dancer with Pet Shop Boys, that he credits with kicking off his career as a choreographer. “Travelling the world meant being exposed to different types of men, different ideas of masculinity,” he says. Discovering butoh, a traditional form of Japanese dance theatre, was a “big thing for me”. Butoh typically features dancers in white body makeup performing intense and technically rigid body moves. He had unwittingly been a fan of the style for years, having been fascinated with the character Sadako’s creepily deliberate movements in the Japanese horror classic Ring. Blackstock calls this form of cultural exchange “sampling”, likening his use of movements from martial arts in his choreography to Wu-Tang Clan’s use of sounds lifted from kung fu movies. “I was a big Bruce Lee fan as a kid, and I always noted that crossover with hip-hop.” I ask if he is wary of appropriating other cultures for his benefit, just as hip-hop, and now grime and drill, have been subsumed into western culture. “I can only be as conscious as I can be. I don’t think any of us have full awareness of what we’re doing. All we can do is try to respect people’s spaces, people’s identities, and yeah, it’s very much something I’m learning to do also … ” he says, trailing off as though only partly happy with his response. Traplord, however, is very much situated in his own personal experience, even if it maintains his penchant for a broad range of cultural reference points. The show was conceived during two weeks of intimate conversations with a group of friends and collaborators he invited to his rehearsal space in an abandoned east London leisure centre. It draws on Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, Toni Morrison’s Tar Baby and the legacy of Blackface to inform its interrogation of contemporary Blackness. Blackstock is obsessed with what it means to be a Black man today, especially given how often we hear that Black masculinity is “in crisis”. “I just wanted to put my friends on: young Black men on stage telling their authentic truth at a time when I felt that story wasn’t being told on a theatrical stage,” he says. “It’s a fever dream of masculinity.” On Twitter, Blackstock describes himself as a “roadnaissance man”, (riffing on the slang term “roadman”). “Someone joked that I’m a roadnaissance man and it just stuck: I’m young, I’m trying to do something new and that means having your hands in many different pies, but I still feel connected to street culture and the road life.” Blackstock no longer lives in south London, having headed east to be near his rehearsal studio, where he lives with his fiancee, whom he met in 2009 while on a shoot in New York. Unsurprisingly perhaps given the emphasis he places on his own absent father, he is adamant that he wants to have children one day, even if that is not currently on the horizon. “For a long time I felt detached and, for me, that detachment came from a lack of love,” he says. “From feeling a sense of abandonment that led me to abandon myself. I’m interested in elevating those voices. People like me who felt they were abandoned.” As Traplord’s opening draws nearer, Blackstock says he “feels like a superhero … I feel like I’ve been sent here to save the dance scene. Maybe that’s just the ego version but I need people to understand that dance is amazing and recognise how dope the UK scene is. It’s not just what you’ve seen on social media, people busting simple dance moves, we’re here to tell stories. We’re more than just backing dancers.” Traplord is at 180 Studios, London, from 26 March until 16 April.",Arts/Stage,Ivan Michael Blackstock: ‘On TV the imagery around young Black men is very violent’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/17/ivan-michael-blackstock-on-tv-the-imagery-around-young-black-men-is-very-violent
2/17/2022,"The New York brand Collina Strada takes sustainability seriously – its website describes it as “a platform for social issues and awareness” rather than a fashion brand – but it’s loved by a younger demographic because it brings the fun too. Its contribution to New York fashion week on Wednesday was no exception. Rather than a show, a film called The Collinas was debuted at the Angelika cinema. A spoof of a reality TV show documenting a hapless intern, Tommy, joining the Collina Strada team, it sent up the dogmatism associated with sustainability with the eye rolls, vocal fry and side eye recognisable to viewers of shows such as Keeping Up With the Kardashians and The Hills.  The use of a disposable cup is greeted with a damning “ew” while Tommy’s pastrami sandwich is a thing of horror to other staff members tucking into raw carrots and broccoli. “I haven’t seen a dead animal since 2013,” says one. This film is a surprise for a brand so known for doing sustainability well but perhaps the irony is a reaction to the rise of the brand – and fashion’s increasing engagement with sustainability – over recent years. Hillary Taymour founded Collina Strada, while a fashion student, in 2009 – a year when terms such as “sustainability” or “deadstock” would have led a brand to be labelled niche rather than seen as an industry trailblazer. Collina Strada is now very much the latter: it’s produced in small batches in New York, prioritises more sustainable fabrics and has a partnership with a Ghana-based textile waste not-for-profit called the OR Foundation to reuse materials. Crucially, Collina Strada’s clothes are made mindfully but they also have a Y2K, club-ready aesthetic that appeals to Gen Z. All the actors in the film wore the colourful, cut-up, more-is-more designs of the brand. The audience at the Angelika mirrored the style of those on the film, suggesting the invitees were also friends of the brand. Many, including Taymour, wore the tie-dyed, oversized, arty clothes that the brand is known for. The casting for shows and films has also been ahead of the game. Models are always diverse: across age, size, ethnicity, gender and physical ability. The 70-year-old mother of her collaborator, Charlie Engman, is a favourite muse, as is Aaron Philip, the black, transgender and disabled model. Both appeared in The Collinas along with the models Cory Kennedy and Jazzelle Zanaughtti, executive editorial director at Dazed & Confused Lynette Nylander and – to make it really meta – a real reality TV star, Whitney Port, who made her name on The Hills. Wider fashion is finally catching up with Taymour . Nominated for a CDFA award in 2019, she was selected by the Gucci designer Alessandro Michele to be part of 2021’s digital festival, GucciFest, and has collaborated with Levi’s and Reebok. Celebrities including Rihanna, Rosalia, Charlie XCX and Camilla Mendes have worn her clothes. Speaking to the Financial Times this month, she described what drives her. “My goal with Collina is to teach people and have fun,” she says. “We’re just trying to make fashion a little less horrible.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,New York brand Collina Strada offers a club-ready aesthetic ,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/17/new-york-fashion-collina-strada-club-ready-aesthetic

2/17/2022,"Whenever my aunt Hilary Peters had any money – including a large sum given to her by her wealthy father, the literary agent AD Peters – she would give it away at the earliest opportunity. Long before the green movement became fashionable, her interest in religions (though she retained independence from all of them) merged with ecology and a deep love of animals, and in the early 1970s she set about healing some of the barren, post-industrial acres of London’s docklands. Hilary, who has died aged 83, encouraged young urbanites to connect with nature - such “connectedness” was intrinsic and vital to her - by starting one of the first city farms in Britain at Surrey Docks. She grew plants in the dock’s masonry and made home-made goat’s cheese for city workers’ lunches. Under her care, goats gambolled and hens scratched in an environment far from rural. Her book Docklandscape (1978) gives a good account of her trials and successes.  The daughter of AD (Augustus Dudley) Peters and his second wife, Margaret, Hilary was born in London, with two much older half-siblings. She attended Francis Holland school, then studied theology at St Anne’s College, Oxford. Thereafter she embraced poverty. After her work at the city farm, she lived happily in a narrow boat (with the playwright NF Simpson) for more than a decade and cruised the country’s canal systems, becoming an expert on these waterways. It may have been during this time that she conceived the idea of herself as a “pilgrim without destination”, subsequently transferring herself and the inevitable couple of dogs to a renovated ambulance and touring the country for 10 years. During this time she came to know almost all its landscapes and byways intimately, and gained a compendious knowledge of its churches and large country houses. For some years she edited the journal Follies and gained the reputation for ignoring “Private” signs and gaining entry to any folly that caught her attention. This acquaintanceship with landed gentry contrasted happily with her work for many years as a prison visitor. When foot-and-mouth struck in 2001 she joined farmers resisting what she regarded as the needless destruction of herds that had taken generations to establish. Thereafter, with scarcely a penny to her name, and by the good fortune that seemed innate in her, she became custodian of a beautiful gatehouse on the Badminton estate where she spent the rest of her life. Hilary had thought her mother “melodramatic”, and along with her father’s early departure from the marriage, this seems to have put her off the idea of family altogether. But she made up for it by enduring friendships. Many of those she had met on her travels came to stay at the gatehouse over the years, including a good few people in difficulties seeking a refuge. Hilary’s continual concern was to lay bare, as she saw it, the illusions of the self-constructed ego and to find her way through to the “other world” of a oneness we all, in her view, try to separate ourselves from. She was, I think, the least judgmental person I have ever met. A self-professed hermit, she nevertheless ended her days with an enormous circle of loving and devoted friends from every social class and all walks of life. Hilary is survived by her older sister, the literary biographer Catherine Peters.",News/Environment,Hilary Peters obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/hilary-peters-obituary
2/17/2022,"Part-wild hybrid cats could be banned by the UK government, after social media helped bring these extreme breeds to popularity. With their huge size, powerful muscles and spotted coats, hybrid cats are seen by some as the perfect pet for the social media age. But the growing trade raises concerns over animal welfare and the wildlife black market.  Government sources said they planned to review the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018. A source said: “During this review we will consider whether there is a need to introduce licensing arrangements for cat breeders including restrictions on the breeding of certain types of cats.” Current UK legislation does not regulate the hybridisation of exotic felids with domestic cats. Campaigners have argued that breeds that are part wildcat are unsuitable for most pet owners owing to their complex needs, and put pressure on rare felines in the wild because an increased demand for these cats means some breeders resort to the illegal wildlife trade to find wildcats to breed from. Savannah cats, a cross between a domestic cat and an African serval, have become particularly popular on social media owing to their striking look. One such cat, Stryker, has more than 800,000 followers on Instagram. A “luxury cattery” promoting the breed has 44,000 followers. The savannah cat breed was only recognised in 2001 and since then there has been a surge in its popularity as a trophy pet, with “F1 hybrids” – a cat with a serval as a parent – fetching up to £20,000 a kitten. According to research by the Wildheart Trust, there are 259 small and medium exotic cats registered as pets in the UK. A large number of these cats are used for breeding, producing hybrids such as the savannah. A spokesperson for the animal charity said: “Urgent legislative action to make this form of hybridisation illegal will prevent the suffering of individual animals caught up in this trade and mitigate against future threats to wild populations of exotic felids. The Wildheart Animal Sanctuary has over 40 years of experience caring for exotic felids. We see first-hand the physical and psychological damage inflicted on animals at the hands of humans.” Bengals, such as that owned – and kicked – by the disgraced footballer Kurt Zouma, were created by breeding domestic animals with the Asian leopard cat. While nowadays the breed is established, most are bred with each other rather than wildcats. Many are found dumped at rescue centres because their high-energy personalities are too much for their owners to handle. Those bengals that have a wildcat parent or grandparent could be subject to a ban, but many of the breed are now so interbred that wildcats are far back in their lineage, so experts have said these could still be allowed. A spokesperson for Battersea Dogs and Cats Home said it supported a ban on breeding these pets in the UK. They said: “In recent years demand has grown for designer hybrid cats such as savannah cats, a cross between a domestic cat and an African serval. Unsurprisingly these cats are not suitable for a domestic home environment, due to their wild cat DNA, their size, and their very strong predatory instincts. “We have seen so many examples of animals being bred for their looks rather than welfare, causing numerous welfare issues. It’s vital that we clamp down on this practice and stop further animals suffering at the hands of indiscriminate breeders.” The RSPCA is also calling for a crackdown on the breeding of these cats, because it involves a demand for dangerous wild animals. This has implications both for human safety and animal welfare. The RSPCA scientific officer Evie Button said: “We have concerns about the breeding, trade and keeping of wild – or ‘exotic’ – animals kept as pets, including those classified as dangerous wild animals, such as servals. We believe that animals should only be kept in captivity if good welfare can be assured and this can be very challenging. “Exotic pets are wild, non-domesticated animals kept in captivity and so their needs are essentially no different to the same species living in the wild. Some species – like servals – are unsuitable to be kept as pets because their needs are too complex to be met in a household environment.” She said the charity was pushing for a wider review into the keeping of exotic animals as pets.",News/World news,UK could ban part-wild hybrid cats after social media fuels boom in popularity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/uk-could-ban-part-wild-hybrid-cats-after-social-media-fuels-boom-in-popularity
2/17/2022,"Fittingly for self-distributed works by a true American independent, Patrick Wang’s four features to date stand tall with a graceful and tenacious outsiderdom. Their handmade quality and occasional rough edges may have made them a hard sell, but this seems unfair. There’s a collectivist spirit, moral conviction and self-taught experimentalism at work here – the latter given increasing room to express itself as Wang has gradually untethered himself from realism – that demands attention. Especially impressive is Wang’s 2011 debut In the Family (****) – starring Wang himself as Joey Williams, a Texan interior designer whose partner Cody (Trevor St John) is killed in a car accident. Cody’s will, written long before their relationship, states that his sister Eileen (Kelly McAndrew) should act as guardian to Chip (a beautifully instinctive performance by Sebastian Banes), his six-year-old son by his previous heterosexual marriage. This leaves the devastated Joey, himself a foster kid, flailing for legal options to preserve his relationship with Chip.  Wang – also a theatre director – likes to squat naturalistically in Joey’s household with signature middle-distance long takes. While this makes the 160-minute In the Family a testing prospect, the intimacy he fosters pays off, because you fully comprehend what Joey is fighting for. Wang’s understated approach to this Asian-American life is somewhat similar to last year’s Minari: racism (or homophobia, for that matter) is never explicitly mentioned as the reason why his in-laws suddenly cold-shoulder him. But prejudice subtly lingers in the vicinity: the hospital officiously bars him from visiting Cody in intensive care. As Wang subtly intensifies the style, the legal sparring builds into something truly engrossing and that wields a wily humanistic force. The lesson here is that people power and communication are worth more than systems and legal processes. “Those limits can be distracted. So don’t head straight for them,” says the gentleman lawyer who comes to Joey’s aid. The deposition scene in which Joey displays unflappable southern aplomb deserves to be a legal genre classic. Shorter but offering less substance is 2015’s The Grief of Others (**), adapted from a novel by Leah Hager Cohen. It’s another household affair, with Trevor St John returning; he plays the paterfamilias of the Ryries, who are close to breaking point after a horrific postpartum event. Wang cranks up the formalism here, with the opening stages scattered among various family members and bystanders cradling various degrees of personal agony, and interlude scenes shot red-filtered from the perspective of the deceased. But the drama constantly struggles to grasp the central nub of the trauma, caught between flat behavioural sequences (in which everything is subtext) and ragged melodramatic confessionals. Wang’s theatrical roots are given full rein in the two halves of the playful but empowering 2018 comedy-drama A Bread Factory, an almost Altman-esque sojourn with the team behind a community performing arts centre in the fictional town of Checkford. But Wang is also a former economist, and A Bread Factory Part One: For the Sake of Gold (***) diligently examines the civic value of art. That’s what lesbian couple Dorothea (Tyne Daly) and Greta (Elisabeth Henry), who run the Bread Factory, have to make a case for when a swish rival outfit across town tries to gazump their funding on the back of their new Chinese performance art duo, May Ray. Wang is clearly having great fun with this pair of po-faced chancers, spoofing vapid conceptual pomposity; the same goes for the Chekhov parody performed by one of Bread Factory crew, and another vignette in which a Hollywood heartthrob swans into town. Wang retains the observational neutrality of his other features, but the manic theatricality on stage constantly overflows from the proscenium into the real-life scenes. Wang is clearly a believer in the mutually reinforcing cycle of life and art. A Bread Factory Part Two: Walk With Me a While (****) shows how it’s the work of places such as the Bread Factory to unearth the latter in the former, when the team find a star performer for their production of Euripides’ Hecuba working at a local cafe. By now, the artifice is running amok all over Checkford: a pair of warhorse thespians slip into Russian melancholia over the samovar; cafe patrons tap-dance out their smartphone frustrations; Wes Anderson-style stop-motion sequences show the development work in progress on the play; a clutch of rough and ready chorus-line songs (most written by Wang). But amid this representational frenzy, it’s the simplicity of the Hecuba sequences – spellbindingly performed by Henry and the waitress-turned-actor Teresa (Jessica Pimintel)– that tip the balance back in favour of realism; a sober reminder that the purpose of all this creation is to find truth. As Greta and Dorothea struggle in the rehearsal room and in their private lives, Wang implies that the real worth of art is in giving us the strength to strive and persist. The fact that the box office take for both parts of The Bread Factory combined was $17,325 only proves his point.

2/17/2022,"Has political correctness infiltrated the pages of concert programmes? “These days it’s easier to appreciate the piece as ‘different’ rather than simply ‘sub-standard’,” we were informed in the note for the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment’s performance of Schumann’s violin concerto, as if concepts of good and less good are no longer allowed when discussing music. Let’s just say, then, that Schumann’s concerto is problematic, and that over the 84 years since it was exhumed from the archives in Leipzig and given its belated premiere, many violinists have attempted to solve those problems. But if there’s anyone today who can show that the work belongs in the pantheon of 19th-century violin concertos, it’s surely Isabelle Faust, who was the soloist for the OAE’s performance, with Antonello Manacorda conducting.  Faust certainly tried. As always her playing was a marvel of nimble brilliance, effortlessly navigating the thickets of figuration to which Schumann’s violin writing often resorts, and making the most of the touching simplicity of the concerto’s slow movement. But she could do nothing to mitigate the rambling repetitions in the first and last movements, or their sheer lack of thematic variety, for all her efforts at gilding them. Manacorda tried just as hard to bring life to the routine orchestral accompaniments. His care over textures had been demonstrated right at the start of the concert with his refined, almost stealthy kindling of Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, and, after the concerto, he lavished the same attention on the details of Schumann’s Second Symphony, without ever sacrificing any of its energy, exuberance or lyrical intensity – played on gut strings, with minimal vibrato, the opening of the Adagio was heart-stoppingly beautiful. Manacorda is apparently being talked about as a possible successor to Antonio Pappano at the Royal Opera House; on this evidence he’s certainly a conductor who will bring something fresh to even the most familiar music.",Arts/Music,OAE/Manacorda/Faust review – nimble brilliance and refined care ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/17/oae-manacorda-faust-review-nimble-brilliance-and-refined-care
2/17/2022,"NDT2 is a company of incredible dancers. The younger sibling of Nederlands Dans Theater is made up of the best of international dance graduates (under new artistic director Emily Molnar). Maybe there’s something magic in the energy and ambition and discipline you take into your first big job, matched with precocious technique.It shows in Hans van Manen’s Simple Things, from 2001, a quartet danced with immense finesse, the performers’ classical grounding evident in smooth-as-silk chainé turns and silent, springing jumps. The technical command and celerity of the dancers shows in an entirely different way in Marco Goecke’s new work The Big Crying, with its sharp, glitching angles, fast-forward speed and precise articulation. They nail its demanding complexity. Ricardo Hartley III is especially eye-catching, stretching into the most elastic backbend, his dancing so clean you could eat your dinner off it.  Goecke made the piece after the death of his father (the tops the dancers wear are intended to look like the curtains of a hearse) but it has none of the cliches of grief – no gut-clutching despair, no collapse. His dancers’ world is full of angry jolts, like compulsive thoughts, and a sense of disconnect, from time or the world around them. There’s a striking moment where two dancers throw their chests together, repeatedly and robotically, as if trying to connect at the heart, but nothing yields – the thing is, with work as slick and stylised as this, there’s always the risk the audience feels that sense of distance, too. There’s an interestingly disjointed relationship with Goecke’s chosen soundtrack, songs by Tori Amos, the tumbling waves of piano and her breathy dream-voice up against the severe accents of the dance.A final new piece, Impasse, by Johan Inger, gets us closer to the dancers’ youthful freedom. A trio, at first playfully carefree, are subsumed by encroaching tribes, first a black-clad clan doing sexy Latin hips, then wild, fancy-dressed party animals. The idea’s about the power of peer pressure, the ease with which we follow the crowd. I’m not sure how deeply the work explores its themes but as you can guarantee with NDT2, it has some fantastic dancing. NDT2 are at Sadler’s Wells, London, until 19 February, then touring.",Arts/Stage,NDT2 review – dancing clean enough to eat your dinner off ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/17/ndt2-review-sadlers-wells
2/17/2022,"A groundbreaking moment in the history of trade unions and women’s rights is to be marked with the placement of a blue plaque commemorating the 1888 matchgirls’ strike in east London. It is one of 14 blue plaques to be put up in the capital this year by English Heritage. The organisation has sought to broaden and diversify the scheme by inviting nominations from the public that relate to groups of people as well as individuals.  The strike by 1,400 girls and young women employed at the Bryant & May factory in Bow was prompted by the dismissal of three workers, low pay and dangerous working conditions. Workers at the factory were at risk of developing “phossy jaw”, a disease that could cause disfigurement, abscesses, brain damage and death, that was caused by exposure to white phosphorus used in the manufacture of matches. The workers, mostly aged between 15 and 20 and many of Irish descent, received meagre wages for long working days, and were fined if their work was deemed substandard. After three weeks on strike, the factory’s owner agreed to almost all the women’s demands, and recognised their union. The strike was hailed as a victory for workers’ rights. “These were women who were dismissed as being unskilled, impoverished girls, and the fact they were disciplined enough to organise and stay out [on strike] under real hardship until their demands were met was very significant,” said Anna Eavis, English Heritage’s curatorial director. “It was a spur and influence for other unions and other examples of direct action. It’s a very important episode, and it has a certain romance to it; it captured the imagination. “This plaque is a great way of acknowledging a group of people who would never get a plaque individually.” It will be placed at the site of the Bryant & May factory, which has now been converted into housing, later this year. Among the other blue plaques to be erected is one to the Ayah’s Home in Hackney, which provided a refuge between 1900 and 1921 for nannies and nursemaids from south Asia brought to London by British families but subsequently abandoned. Dr John Conolly (1794-1866), and the former Hanwell Asylum in Middlesex, will be commemorated for his advocacy of a system of non-restraint in caring for mentally unwell people. Conolly dispensed with handcuffs, leg irons and straitjackets that were regularly used in asylums at the time. The National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies, formed in 1897, will also get a blue plaque to mark its Westminster headquarters. At its peak in 1913, it had 50,000 members and nearly 500 affiliates, making it the largest of the organisations campaigning for women’s right to vote. English Heritage will also unveil this year the restorations of three of England’s most important sites – Clifford’s Tower in York, Marble Hill in Twickenham, and Richborough Roman Fort and Amphitheatre in Kent. Tim Laurence, the chair of English Heritage, said the charity – which looks after more than 400 historic buildings, monuments and sites – had had a “very tough” two years because of Covid closures, but had seen “tremendous loyalty” from its members and “terrific support” from the government.",Arts/Culture,"Blue plaque to honour 1888 strike by 1,400 East End matchgirls ",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/17/blue-plaque-to-honour-1888-strike-by-1400-east-end-matchgirls
