4/29/2022,"By Engen Tham and Xie Yu SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai's heavy-handed COVID-19 lockdown is driving scores of foreign residents to flee the commercial centre, denting the appeal of mainland China's most cosmopolitan city and prompting others to rethink their futures in the metropolis. While no official statistics are available for departures in recent weeks, pet movers, property agents and law firms say they are seeing a sharp uptick in departure queries, while online chat groups swapping advice on how to leave the city amid lockdown curbs have swelled. ""Normally we get about 30-40 cases a month but we got over 60 in April,"" said Michael Faung, founder of international pet movers Shanghai M&D pet. The city of 25 million is the China base for numerous multinational firms and long a magnet for expats lured by the international vibe of areas such as the French Concession, where boutiques and cafes line tree-shaded lanes. But China has seen a steady drain in foreigners since the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and subsequent entry restrictions have slowed new entrants to a trickle. Shanghai was officially home to 164,000 foreign residents last year. That compares to 215,000 work visa holders in 2018, according to government data, which did not count their dependents. The last straw for many has been the month-long lockdown, 10 foreign residents told Reuters, describing how they had difficulties obtaining food and fears of being separated from family members should they be infected with COVID. ""Until the lockdown I really couldn't feel the authoritarian government, because you're more or less free to do what you want and I never really lived oppressed,"" said Jennifer Li, a foreigner who is making plans for her family to leave the city that has been their home for 11 years. The handling of COVID ""made us realise how human lives and human mental health is not important to this government,"" she added. The Shanghai government did not respond to a request for comment. China says it must stick with its zero-tolerance approach given the danger the Omicron variant posed to people with underlying health conditions, the elderly and unvaccinated. MORE LEAVING Foreign business chambers have warned of foreign talent flight. The ""number of foreigners in China have halved since pandemic began and could halve again this summer,"" said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce at a recent forum. ""Europeans, including the Brits, will not even fill the Beijing Bird's nest stadium, a capacity of 80,000,"" Wuttke added. British international school Wellington College International Shanghai, which charges up to 348,000 yuan ($53,270) a year, sent a letter to parents on April 15 noting that some of its teachers wanted to return home. It also said it understood that some families were reconsidering their future in Shangahi and extended a deadline for parents to withdraw their children from the school, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. Wellington College did not respond to a request for comment. An April American Chamber of Commerce survey found 44.3% of respondents said they would lose expatriate staff if the current COVID restrictions remain in place for the next year. Shanghai's curbs were initally set to last only five days but have stretched into their fourth week with little clarity on when they may lift. Some of those who managed to leave describe harrowing efforts to reach the airport, from paying $500 for a cab that usually costs $30, battling neighbourhood workers who block departures, to being stranded at the airport after their flights were abruptly cancelled. One described how she and her five-month old daughter spent nearly a week sleeping on the floor of Pudong Airport, running out of food, when issues with documentation for her baby meant she couldn't board her flight. The lockdown has shuttered visa offices and many administrative firms in the city. The woman does not plan on returning to Shanghai, declining to give her name due to privacy reasons. ""With what I have faced, let me just go back to my country and do something there,"" she said. Pudong airport did not respond to a request for comment.

4/29/2022,"By Martin Quin Pollard and David Stanway BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's capital Beijing closed more businesses and residential compounds on Friday, with authorities ramping up contact tracing to contain a COVID-19 outbreak, while resentment at the month-long lockdown in Shanghai grew. In the finance hub, fenced-in people have been protesting against the lockdown and difficulties in obtaining provisions by banging on pots and pans in the evenings, according to a Reuters witness and residents. A video shared on social media, whose authenticity could not be immediately verified, showed a woman warning people via a loud-hailer not to do so, saying such gestures were being encouraged by ""outsiders."" The Shanghai government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In Beijing, authorities were in a race against time to detect COVID cases and isolate those who have been around them. A sign placed outside a residential complex read ""Entry only. No exit."" Polish resident Joanna Szklarska, 51, was sent to a quarantine hotel as a close contact, but she refused to share the room, which had only one bed, with her neighbour. She was sent back home, where authorities installed a front door alarm. Then she was called back to the hotel, where she now has her own room. ""Nothing makes sense here,"" the English-language consultant said by phone. At a regular press conference on Friday, Chinese health officials did not respond to questions on whether Beijing will go under lockdown or what circumstances might prompt such measures. The severe curbs in China have appeared surreal to many parts of the world where people have chosen to live with the virus. And the frequent signs of frustration among citizens will be uncomfortable for China's ruling Communist Party, especially as President Xi Jinping is widely expected to secure a third leadership term this fall. Nomura estimates 46 cities are currently in full or partial lockdowns, affecting 343 million people. Societe Generale estimates that provinces experiencing significant mobility restrictions account for 80% of China's economic output. 'HELLO CITIZENS!' New COVID cases in Beijing remain in the dozens, officials said on Friday, a far cry from Shanghai's numbers. In Beijing's Chaoyang district, the first to undergo mass testing this week, started the last of three rounds of screening on Friday among its 3.5 million residents. Most other districts are due for their third round of tests on Saturday. More apartment blocks were sealed, preventing residents from leaving, and certain spas, KTV lounges, gyms, cinemas and libraries and at least two shopping malls closed on Friday. People who had recently visited venues in areas authorities declared as ""at risk"" have received text messages telling them to stay put until they get their test results. ""Hello citizens! You have recently visited the beef noodles & braised chicken shop in Guanghui Li community,"" one such text read. ""Please report to your compound or hotel immediately, stay put and wait for the notification of nucleic acid testing."" ""If you violate the above requirements and cause the epidemic to spread, you will bear legal responsibility."" 'PEOPLE'S WAR' The April 30-May 4 Labour Day break is one of China's busiest tourist seasons, and the travel industry is taking losses. Companies reopening factories in Shanghai are booking hotel rooms to house workers and turning vacant workshops into on-site isolation facilities as authorities urge them to resume work under COVID curbs. Many foreigners want to flee mainland China's most cosmopolitan city. In response to COVID and other headwinds, China will step up policy support for the economy, a top decision-making body of the Communist Party said on Friday, lifting stocks from recent two-year lows. Details were scarce, but markets reacted to a shift in messaging away from the single-focus on COVID, analysts say. ""Now the goal is to balance containing outbreaks and economic growth,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, president of Pinpoint Asset Management, who expects China's economy to contract in the second quarter. ""This suggests the government may fine-tune the 'zero tolerance' policy to allow some flexibility."" Chinese authorities say fighting COVID is vital to save lives. ""The battle against the COVID epidemic is a war, a war of resistance, a peopleâ€™s war,"" said Liang Wannian, head of the National Health Commission's COVID response panel. In Shanghai, authorities said more people have been gradually allowed in principle to leave their homes recently. More than 12 million, nearly half the population, are now in that category. Still, many cannot leave their compounds, while those who can have few places to go as shops and other venues are closed. Often one of the 52,000 police mobilised for the lockdown asks them to return home. Many residents have grumbled at the inflexible policing, which sometimes does not take into account health emergencies or other individual circumstances. ""Some individual policemen...are emotional or mechanical,"" Shu Qing, head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, told reporters, admitting ""shortcomings.""
