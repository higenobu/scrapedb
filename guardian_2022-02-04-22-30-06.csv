2/4/2022,"“There’s just something so cathartic about getting hit in the head with a pillow,” posits Steve Williams as he grills a couple of steaks on the back deck of his catamaran. Catfish spin in the yacht’s neon stern lights, scanning the water’s surface for scraps of food on the Boca Raton harbor. Williams, a terrifically large muscular man, queues up a video on his phone. It’s the second ever exhibition match produced by Pillow Fight Championship (PFC), an organization Williams founded in south Florida with the goal of turning pillow fighting into a professional sport. The match took place back in October, but tonight it’s available for the first time, free of charge, on Fite.tv, the premier direct-to-consumer streaming service for combat sports.  Despite a full stomach, two empty bottles of cabernet and the hum of trade winds, there’s a hint of anxiety on Williams’s face. “I’m dying to know the stats for this fight,” he says. People cheer on fighters at the PFC Pillow Fight Championship. Photograph: Bryan Cereijo/The Guardian As Williams sees it, those stats, or number of streams, will determine the long term viability of his latest venture. In one week he will host the PFC Pound Down in Miami, his company’s largest organized pillow fight and the first pay-per-view event, where the sport’s inaugural champions will be crowned. A willing audience would be a boon for his cause. “You don’t really need to explain [pillow fighting] to people – that’s the beauty,” says Williams. The pillows – which make a crinkling sound like a dry diaper when held still and crack like a horsewhip when connecting with a cheekbone – are queen-sized, stuffed with foam and encased in nylon sailcloth. Fighters are matched up according to relative size and experience levels by what’s called a “matchmaker” in the universe of combat sports. There are only three 90-second rounds because hurling a broad, 2lb pillow with the torque of a golf club becomes virtually impossible after the four-minute mark, even for athletes in elite shape. A serial entrepreneur with a very niche dossier – from third-party cellphone roaming services to airport “crash phones” to a kind of proto-iTunes music subscription platform – Williams has a gift for marrying usefulness with novelty. As he sees it, pillow fighting is not just a gimmick. Steve Williams founded the Pillow Fighting Championship. He is working towards making pillow fighting a professional sport. Photograph: Mary Beth Koeth/The Guardian “There’s hardcore aggression with pillow fighting, but nobody gets hurt. A lot of people don’t want to see the blood and violence any more.” Williams is framing PFC as the next UFC – the largest mixed martial arts (MMA) organization in the world – borrowing heavily from the latter’s franchising business model and lurid, aggressive branding. Going door-to-door selling the martial-arts studios and boxing gyms of south Florida on his concept, he recruited dozens of active MMA fighters, reality TV stars, bare-knuckle boxers, mechanics, single moms and veterinarians to start training with his pillows. Then he hosted exhibition matches in south Florida gyms and casinos. Professional fighters appreciated the intensity and competition as much as the laypeople. Due to the severity of the whupping in a MMA match, competitors can only handle one or two a year. PFC embodies the notion of fighting without risking serious bodily injury. “I’ve been in martial arts my entire life, and I can tell you that this is going to be bigger than all of them,” says Yuri Villefort, a Brazilian professional MMA fighter who runs Indio Dojo in Boca Raton, one of the first gyms to partner with Williams. “Anyone can compete, and anyone can win. It doesn’t matter your size, age, or background.” Santiago Seijo swings against his opponent, Markus ‘Maluko’ Perez. Photograph: Bryan Cereijo/The Guardian Williams’ first pillow fight exhibition match took place last September, the second in October. They weren’t ticketed, but they generated video content, which was all Williams needed to spread the word outside of south Florida. Short clips went viral on Instagram, got picked up by Barstool Sports, and ended up on morning shows in England, which stoked a wave of new applicants. “I’ve never seen anything take off like this,” he says. Williams tallies that he’s spent over $350,000 of his own money to produce these fights and hasn’t made a dime in return. In his estimation, it’ll all be worthwhile this Saturday, when the bell rings at the Pound Down, the first “professional” tournament, which loosely means that athletes will be paid for their performance. Championship belts will be on the line, and the world will (with any luck) be watching. “Live around the world, we’re set for two explosive rounds of nocturnal neck support combat,” says the announcer in an ill-fitting tuxedo jacket. It’s 9pm inside a sprawling industrial park 20 miles west of downtown Miami. A throng of marginally famous social media influencers and fighters with blooms of cauliflower ear gather ringside. Resplendent in a blue velour blazer, Williams poses for pictures with Logan Paul’s boxing trainer. The VIP section is a bunkbed above the seating area, where a smartly dressed couple recline awkwardly. All told, there are a few dozen spectators and potential investors. Everyone else is associated with the byzantine video production effort. With five months’ experience, Terrell ‘TJ’ Jenkins is considered a veteran of the sport. Photograph: Bryan Cereijo/The Guardian Sixteen men and eight women from across the US and South America are competing in a single-elimination bracket for a shot at the title and the $5,000 purse. All matches are two rounds, with the exception of the final, which is three. Certain upgrades are evident: each fighter now has a trainer and a cut man in their corner, and a PFC branded uniform. (In Williams’ previous exhibition matches, competitors wore golf gloves and their own mismatched gym clothes.) On an overhead big screen, a live feed shows Terrell “TJ” Jenkins on his slow march from the locker room to the ring for his first fight. The crowd chants his name as he climbs through the ropes. He flexes and smiles wildly. Staring menacingly in the opposite corner is professional MMA and bare-knuckle fighter Mike Trujillo. Having all of five months’ experience, Jenkins is one of the few veterans of the nascent sport. For several weeks leading up to his first professional bout, he’s been weight-training and practicing MMA at Villefort’s dojo. PFC fighters Phillip Aughinbaugh and Krystal Tait get hit during their fights at the PFC Pillow Fight Championship Pound Down event. Photographs: Bryan Cereijo/The Guardian “You can’t apply too much technique. Otherwise, you’ll freeze up,” he says. “I’m fine with being the underdog. It’s part of my identity.” Jenkins, who is 6ft 2in with shoulders like Dwight Howard, had an admittedly troubled upbringing in Yonkers, New York. “We didn’t have the things that most people have – money, stable home, father figures. And whatever you’re lacking at home you seek elsewhere.” He spent a decade on probation in New York and several weeks being homeless after landing in south Florida in 2019. He slowly saved up to start his own mobile detailing business – his first office was in a commercial building owned by Williams. “We hit it off right away,” Jenkins says. When Williams started PFC, he invited Jenkins to try out. “I felt like a little kid again,” he says wistfully. “It brought back waves of that same joy and excitement. I needed to pass that on to other people.” He appears to be in a state of perpetual awe concerning how his life turned out – a business owner who’s able to employ members of his family, and a local favorite to win the main event on Saturday. “When I get in the ring, I’m thinking about my past, I’m thinking about all the stuff that tried to break me,” he says. “Work the back hand, and stay on him!” Villefort yells from Jenkins’ corner. Jenkins holds the pillow with both hands and swings like he’s trying to send a baseball out to left field. In this case, the ball is Trujillo’s head, and twenty seconds into the second round Jenkins does the unthinkable: he sends Trujillo to the canvas. The referee stops the fight, declaring Jenkins the winner by technical knockout (TKO)—the first victory of this kind in the short history of PFC. The crowd goes ballistic. Jenkins climbs out of the ring and hugs his brother. “I hope he’s alright,” he says, watching as the ringside doctor promptly escorts Trujillo out of the ring and to the hospital. So much for not getting hurt. In the midst of all this excitement, one of the women fighters, Meriah Hall, calmly bounces her one-year-old son, Alaric, on her knee. She looks unexpectedly relaxed. A week earlier, she exhibited a similar manner, pushing Alaric through a park on the west side of Delray Beach, Florida. Hall prefers to train outside rather than in the gym, her workouts consisting of long runs and meditation. In the ring, she’s known as the “Shuttle Launcher” – a reference to her hometown near Cape Canaveral and her fighting style. PFC fighters Meriah Hall, Xavier “Hurricane” Santana, Phillip Aughinbaugh and Krystal Tait get hit during their fights at the PFC Pillow Fight Championship Pound Down event. Photographs: Bryan Cereijo/The Guardian “I needed it,” she says about pillow fighting. “Things changed when I became a mother. It was an outlet to vent all my frustrations about my new life, motherhood and the pandemic.” Last October, around the time of the second exhibition hosted by PFC, her cousin died of complications from Covid-19, leaving a husband and three children. A few weeks later, her aunt died too. Hall won both of her exhibition matches last year. She’d like to protect that undefeated record, but most of all, she wants to honor her late relatives. “Who knows where all this will take me,” she says. “But it has a new meaning now that they’re gone.” Hall is more conservative than usual when she enters the ring on Saturday night. Her supporters speculate as to whether this is a strategy or an off night. Regardless, she still wins her first fight handily against a jiu-jitsu blue belt from the Bronx and advances to the semifinals. But Hall has no answer for Brazilian UFC fighter and two-time Muay Thai world champion Istela Nunes, who goes on to win the women’s division and hoist the title belt at the end of the night. Hall is introduced before her fight. Photograph: Bryan Cereijo/The Guardian Sipping a beer ringside, watching the men’s semifinals, Hall is visibly exhausted. “I feel like I did after my first fight. I guess I didn’t train hard enough,” she says. “I could also use a babysitter.” Jenkins, on the other hand, still has a title fight on the line. In the semis, he faces Hauley Tillman, a local boy, but loses in a split decision. A crescendo of boos rises behind the judges’ booth – the crowd says it was a robbery. Before stepping out of the ring, Jenkins hugs his opponent. “It’s all love,” he says. “I put my name on the map. No one in my family has ever done that. I’ll be back” Of the many winners and losers at the PFC Pound Down, the person who had the most to gain is Williams, and by Sunday morning he’s doing victory laps in the tide of predictably corny headlines, from the New York Post to Haaretz, that has surged overnight. Hall turned to pillowfighting as a way to combat the stress of motherhood and the pandemic. Photograph: Mary Beth Koeth/The Guardian “You wouldn’t believe what’s going on,” he says over the phone. “Japan, England, Brazil, America – they all want to know about pillow fighting.” His plan to install the program in schools, gyms, and dojos all over the world is being hatched expeditiously with mail-order model – call PFC and have a box of the (patent-pending) official PFC pillows delivered to your gym’s doorstep in one week. The wheels continue to turn as he thinks about the kids’ league, noting that the connection between contact sports and neurological diseases such as CTE has made parents less inclined towards football and martial arts. And then there’s the advertising: he says the absence of blood and gore makes this more attractive for mainstream corporations. “Bed, Bath, and Beyond would make sense,” he muses. Current sponsors include a bedding company called Pillow Guy. “Not to be confused with ‘the MyPillow guy’ – we’re not trying to get political.” Istela Nunes is declared winner of her fight against Meriah Hall. Nunes won the women’s division of PFC Championship. Photograph: Bryan Cereijo/The Guardian That anxiousness from the previous week has clearly been supplanted by elation. Williams says that he has the streaming numbers from Saturday’s Pound Down but doesn’t want to publicize them, either because they’re paltry, or so strong that he wants to play them close to the chest. This is yet one more reminder that it’s his sport, and he makes the rules. No matter, he’s still flush with confidence. “I’m sure that one day we’ll have a multimillion-dollar pillow fight, and the world will be watching.”",Sport/Sport,"Pillow fighting could be the next great combat sport – no, seriously",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/pillow-fighting-championship-pfc-sport
2/4/2022,"Shaftesbury, which owns swathes of Chinatown, Soho and Covent Garden, said West End crowds were returning despite the Omicron variant, with the prospect of an extended period of uninterrupted trading. The landlord, which owns a 16-acre (6-hectare) portfolio in the heart of London, said its vacancy rate had fallen below 5% for the first time since the pandemic started, to 4.9% in recent weeks – just above the 4.8% recorded in March 2020.  Brian Bickell, the chief executive, said the strong rebound in confidence and activity since last summer had continued into the key pre-Christmas period and the recovery was on track, despite short-term disruption from Omicron. City centres have been hammered by Covid-19 lockdowns over the past two years, with shops, restaurants and bars forced to shut their doors for several months at a time, forcing many out of business. During the first lockdown in spring 2020, the West End ground to a halt, and as many as 180 of the 630 flats owned by Shaftesbury were vacated as people moved out of London. When the new, highly contagious Omicron variant emerged in early December and the government imposed fresh restrictions, including ordering people to work from home where possible, some restaurants and bars closed temporarily and footfall in shops plummetted. The number of shoppers, tourists and office workers coming into the West End fell back to levels seen last summer. But with the lifting of restrictions in late January, “visitors and the West End’s important working population are now returning”, Bickell said. “Together with an improving outlook for international leisure and business travel, there is now the prospect of an extended period of uninterrupted trading growth. “Robust occupier interest across all our uses and in each of our locations has continued throughout the period, our vacancy levels are trending lower towards pre-pandemic levels and rent collection rates continue to improve.” Bickell told investors at the landlord’s annual meeting that visitor numbers in the West End were higher over the last weekend of January than at the same time in 2019. Businesses that were struggling to pay their rent during the pandemic are now mostly paying it again: for the quarter to 31 December, Shaftesbury received 88% of rent, with 10% outstanding and 2% waived. The landlord now only grants rental support on an exceptional case-by-case basis. John Cahill, an analyst at the US investment bank Stifel, said: “Short-term staffing issues also appear to be abating, and the long-term outlook is improving with the prospect of a return of international tourists and business travellers.”",News/Business,London property giant Shaftesbury hails return of crowds to West End,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/london-property-giant-shaftesbury-hails-return-of-crowds-to-west-end
2/4/2022,"Brexit checks on food and farm products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must continue pending a judicial review of the order made by Stormont’s agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, the high court in Belfast has ruled. Mr Justice Colton said he was “suspending the order or the instruction given by the minister of agriculture until the further order of this court”.  At the same he granted leave for an application for judicial reviews against the minister’s decision. “There shouldn’t be any confusion hanging over those in the civil service, so I am persuaded this is a case where there should be interim relief. “I therefore make the order to suspend the instruction given by the minister for agriculture until further order of this court.” Poots took the unilateral decision to order officials to halt all checks on Wednesday after taking legal advice from the former attorney general John Larkin. However, it emerged during the hearing that these checks were due to continue until noon next Monday. Colton made no comment on whether the Poots move was lawful or not but said the issues were important enough to proceed to judicial review. His ruling means the Brexit checks will continue until at least 7 March when the next hearing on the matter will take place. It transpired that a similar case was already pending for that date after an anonymised individual launched a legal challenge against Poots’s predecessor, Gordon Lyons. Ciaran O’Hare, of the law practice McIvor Farrell, which is acting for the anonymised member of the public, said the case was a “matter of urgency” as civil servants charged with the orders needed “certainty”. The decision by Poots to halt the checks was part of a wider DUP protest against the Brexit checks, which also led to the first minister, Paul Givan, resigning from his post at Stormont.",News/UK news,Brexit checks on food entering Northern Ireland to continue,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/brexit-checks-on-food-entering-northern-ireland-to-continue

2/4/2022,"After languishing in his car boot for several years, Jordan Bassett’s CD collection – mostly dating back to his teenage years – will soon be on proud display in his newly converted home office space. Bassett, a commissioning editor at the NME, has no means of playing the CDs and, in any case, his musical tastes have moved on. But the 100-150 thin, shiny 5in discs have sentimental value – and, who knows, one day they may be part of a revival similar to vinyl among music aficionados.  Although the decision by Tesco this week to clear its shelves of CDs was an unambiguous indication of the decline of the once-revolutionary music format, it’s not dead yet. Last year, UK sales of physical entertainment products fell 18.5% to just over £1bn, while digital revenues rose by 8.3% to £8.7bn, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. In 2007, at the height of the CD market, more than 2bn discs were sold globally. The digital streaming platform Spotify launched in 2008, and CD sales started their trajectory downwards. But towards the end of last year, there was a blip on the graph. CD sales rose by 15%, mainly thanks to Adele’s 30, which sold nearly 900,000 in CD form, Abba’s Voyage and Ed Sheeran’s =. In a love letter to CDs published in Rolling Stone last month, Rob Sheffield wrote: “Compact discs were never about romance – they were about function. They just worked. They were less glamorous than vinyl, less cool, less tactile, less sexy, less magical. They didn’t have the aura that we fans crave. “You didn’t necessarily get sentimental over your CDs, the way you fetishised your scratchy old vinyl, hearing your life story etched into the nicks and crackles …. But CDs work. They just do. You pop in the disc, press play, music booms out. They delivered the grooves so efficiently, they became the most popular format ever.” He lauded CD “boxsets, bootlegs, mixes from friends old and new, young bands whose albums I buy from the merch table at live shows”, and lamented the ephemeral nature of streaming culture. A recent article in Wired magazine also praised the CD format, and its “ridiculous affordability”. Streaming was for the masses, vinyl was for hipsters, said the author, but his experiment in CD listening had brought “unexpected joys”. Despite the convenience of streaming music at the touch of a keypad, some fans prefer to have tangible collections, complete with liner notes, to pore over, arrange and rearrange. And, as Adele pointed out to Spotify when threatening to pull her latest album from the platform unless it hid the shuffle button, “our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended”. Bassett said: “We may be seeing the end of CDs as a mass-market product, but we could also be seeing the beginning of the repositioning of the CD as a more fetishistic item.” But, he added, it was unlikely to match the vinyl revival of recent years. “There is not the same romance, the magic of dropping a needle on to vinyl. The plastic cases cracked easily. I remember listening to Nirvana’s Nevermind on the school bus and every time that the bus went over a bump, your CD would skip.” Sean Jackson of Reckless Records in Soho, which has been in business for almost 40 years, said some customers insisted that the quality of analogue sound was superior to digital. “But unless you’re really concentrating, you probably wouldn’t notice the difference,” he added. “There’s a market for everything – vinyl, CDs, cassette tapes. Formats go in and out of fashion, but music doesn’t.”",Arts/Music,‘They just worked’: reports of CDs’ demise inspires wave of support ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/they-just-worked-reports-of-cds-demise-inspires-wave-of-support
2/4/2022,"It is Tuesday night at Aggborough and a couple of hours before kick-off against Leamington Town the Harriers Arms, a pub attached to the main stand, is heaving. Later, after a 3-0 victory that moves the club four points off the top of the National League North, the Kidderminster manager, Russell Penn, mingles there with elderly fans to chew the fat. It is also the place where celebrations continued after the team beat Reading to secure a spot in the FA Cup fourth round, with West Ham the visitors on Saturday. “I was apparently dancing around with a mop at midnight,” says the chairman, Richard Lane. “I want to make sure that everybody who has put a huge amount of effort in, on and off the pitch, enjoys this moment.” For the past couple of weeks, it has been a diet of 14-hour days and precious little sleep for those behind the scenes. West Ham represent the club’s ninth game in four weeks. There are four full-time office staff – five if you count Toby the apprentice – including Helen Macdonald, the ticket office manager whose duties extend to preparing for 500 hospitality guests, and who, as the longest-serving staff member, has witnessed the highs and lows of the past 20 years. She worked as a volunteer when West Ham last came to the Worcestershire town in 1994, eliminating Harriers in the fifth round of the Cup. “In years gone by, as family and friends we would often speak about the time we played West Ham,” Macdonald says. “I only came in and made a few cups of tea but it was a massive occasion. It is brilliant for the area, local businesses, families; everyone has bought into it.”  As Macdonald speaks, the assistant manager, Jimmy O’Connor, pops into reception. Outside the club shop (which stocks commemorative mugs adorned with the West Ham crest) a snaking queue of supporters wait to buy wristbands for the fan zone – where Penn and O’Connor have promised Lane they will sing if they pull off the unthinkable – from the bar manager, Lorna Parsons. Jon Wilson, a volunteer who attended the West Ham game, is selling programmes. “The ground was totally different then. Over the far side where we stood was affectionately called ‘the cowshed’,” Wilson says of what is now the East Stand, which backs on to the Severn Valley Steam Railway. “They put extra scaffolding in for extra seats. The place was packed.” There is plenty of symmetry with that Cup run in ’94. In the third round that year they overcame Birmingham City, then run by the now West Ham directors David Gold, David Sullivan and Karren Brady, and in the fourth round they breached a Preston defence that included the now West Ham manager, David Moyes. Lane, whose father, Graham, was a director at Kidderminster, recalls being in the directors’ box at St Andrew’s when Jon Purdie scored the winner. For fans such as Matthew Hatton, who follows Kidderminster home and away, the tie marks a special occasion. “I will be up there with my dad, Colin, who has been taking me to home games since I was five,” Hatton says. “To be able to stand there with him and see a game of this magnitude is brilliant. You can feel the buzz throughout the town. I missed my cousin’s wedding to go to Eastbourne away … but I did manage to get back for last orders.” The stadium announcer, Scott Jones, a volunteer since 2007, gives a pre-match rallying call: “It is time to get behind the boys in red: Aggborough, let’s make some noise.” A minute before kick-off Stuart Pearce takes a seat in the directors’ box. Among the crowd is the Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant, a Wolves vice-president who counts Kidderminster as his second team, and on Saturday the VIP list will include the former England and West Ham striker Sir Geoff Hurst. Alan Irvine or Pearce, both of whom are on Moyes’s staff, have been at the Harriers’ past four matches. Penn and his assistant attended West Ham’s game with Leeds amid their relentless schedule. “Fifth in the Premier League coming to Kidderminster Harriers?” Penn says. “It is scary … whatever the result, we have to enjoy the experience. Everyone in non-league is rooting for us.” When Spennymoor Town visited in October, there were nine press strewn around the stadium but more than 100 media personnel will be here on Saturday. Everybody has wanted a piece of the pie, the club swamped by commercial interest. A clip of Penn’s post-match dressing room team talk after the Reading win went viral. “Fourth round? We ain’t done that in 35 years,” he says, lowering himself. “But we’re doing it now, baby!” Where was Lane at that moment? Having a celebratory pint of Bathams upstairs. There have been TV crews at training and the BBC has set up a studio at the stadium, ready for Match of the Day coverage, which is worth £110,000 to the club. In total sixth-tier Kidderminster, the lowest-ranked team left in the Cup, hope to generate more than £200,000, which will help fund new stadium floodlights and an irrigation system at the training ground. They started the season with a £400,000 playing budget, about the amount West Ham’s highest-paid player, Kurt Zouma, earns every month. “We will put our very small budget against a very big budget and the world will be able to see whether it is justified or not,” Lane says. The club have fielded media inquiries from Bermuda, Brazil and beyond. There will be a Scandinavian contingent in the stands, supporters from Harriers of Norway, a fan group that followed the team after being inspired by a YouTube clip of Bo Henriksen, a Danish striker who was signed by Jan Molby, walking out of the dressing room, past the tunnel and manager’s office and into the Harriers Arms, via a side door. They have constructed a ‘mini Aggborough’ in Aalesund, a replica terrace to watch DVDs of matches sent by the club, and paid for a new ice machine for the club. As full-time approaches Jones reads the attendance over the public address system: 1,668, including 55 away fans, a fraction of the expected sellout crowd on on Saturday. The North Stand terrace is rocking. Bobbing supporters bang on advertising hoardings – not publicising conglomerates but a local bedding centre and salvage company – and break into song, serenading Amari Morgan-Smith. Jaiden White, a teenager who came through the academy, adds a third goal with a minute to play. “Controlled, controlled,” Penn says as a trio of players, including Keith Lowe, 36, who is in his third spell with the club, complete a warm-down. He knows there is a delicate balance between his players relishing the occasion and being overawed. “I’ve been there as a player: you run an hour’s worth of legs in 10 minutes and then you blow up after an hour, but that’s natural,” Penn says. “They are going to have adrenaline up to their eyeballs but we have to curb that because there is still a game to play. They are going to see 5,000 through the turnstiles, lights everywhere, flashing phones, but we have to get rid of that one second after kick-off because then it’s game on.”",Sport/Football,Kidderminster v West Ham: ‘You can feel the buzz throughout the town’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/kidderminster-v-west-ham-you-can-feel-the-buzz-throughout-the-town
2/4/2022,"When Jabari Banks first learned of auditions taking place for the lead role in Bel-Air, a dark reimagining of his favourite 90s sitcom, he heard his destiny calling. “I was like, ‘Oh, I’m perfect for this!’ I knew at that moment: this has got to be me.” At the time, Banks was just 23 and still a musical theatre student who had never starred in anything, but what he lacked in work experience he made up for in relevant life experience. Banks is a talented rapper who knows his way around the basketball court and, like the song says, he’s “West Philadelphia born and raised”. In other words, he has a lot in common with the original Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Will Smith, who was a 21-year-old rapper in 1990 when his own life got, in the words of the show’s theme tune, flipped-turned upside down.  It started as a chance meeting with TV producer Benny Medina and within six weeks, Smith had relocated cross-country, co-written a brilliantly catchy theme tune with the legendary Quincy Jones (another of the show’s execs) and was on set filming the first episode. The sitcom’s premise was based on Medina’s own teenage experience of moving in with a rich white family in Beverly Hills, after growing up poor in South LA, but it also mirrored Smith’s own Philly-street-to-LA-stardom journey. Thirty years later, the life-imitating-art-imitating-life cycle continues, says Banks: “My life parallels Will’s life in the show so specifically, it’s really crazy. To be in front of the camera, and to play on this level is so beautiful.” The first episode of Bel-Air features Banks’ character Will enjoying a slower, more reflective version of the “Yo, homes, smell ya later” cab ride depicted in the sitcom’s opening credits. Shooting the part where Will steps out of the cab to gather his thoughts and enjoy the view was surreal: “I’m sitting there on Mulholland Drive and Will, the character, is looking out; but that’s Jabari’s first time on Mulholland Drive too, y’know?” When The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air debuted in September 1990, it met an audience already familiar with, and enthusiastic about, Black sitcoms. The Cosby Show, depicting an upper-middle class doctor’s family in Brooklyn had been on air since 1984 and its slightly edgier spin-off, A Different World, about students at a historically Black college in Virginia, had run from 1987. In the UK, Desmond’s, starring Norman Beaton as the grumpy-gregarious proprietor of a Peckham barbershop, was already a flagship show among Channel 4’s proudly multicultural output. Yet The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air still felt fresh, and has remained so in the decades since, through re-runs and into the streaming era: “I wasn’t even born before it was off the air,” says Banks. “My family had this six-series boxset that would be on repeat in my home. So I definitely caught all the episodes, for sure … This show basically raised me.” Many others share that abiding affection. The show’s theme tune has become a karaoke standard among millennials, and the teary televised reunion in 2020 was warmly received by a lockdown audience eager for nostalgic comfort-viewing. Even before then, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was present enough in the ether to inspire the creativity of Morgan Cooper, a 27-year-old filmmaker from Kansas City. He created Bel-Air, a four-minute fan film, in the form of a trailer for an imagined reboot and uploaded it to YouTube in March 2019, where it has racked up 7.2m views. Among those viewers was Will Smith – now a 50-year-old movie star and father of three with a mansion of his own. Uncle Phil would be proud. In his new guise of Hollywood mogul, Smith helped usher a real show into existence, with Cooper on board as a co-executive producer and director. Their first major challenge was to find a lead: “We needed a unicorn, because that’s exactly who Will was in the original,” says Cooper. “We needed a young man who had the charm, the charisma, and [who was] able to give you dramatic performances while still having great comedic timing.” Auditions were held nationwide, but it just so happens their unicorn shared Smith’s hometown. “I remember meeting Jabari in Philly and within five minutes, I knew he was our Will.” Bel-Air’s other characters and premise have also stuck close to their model, but the episodes have lengthened, from sitcom-standard 22 mins to encompass a widening perspective. Banks summarises this as “if all of the characters from the original wrote in a diary, and we got to open up that diary and dive deep into their feelings”. That tone is matched by a visual style that translates the royal reference of the title into Pan-Africanist imagery, reminiscent of Beyoncé’s Black Is King 2020 visual album, all rendered in a refined palette of teal and grey. Sadly, that means no backwards caps or 90s neons for this generation’s Will. It would be too obviously retro. “We’ve been asking ourselves, how do we recreate that style, but for now,” says Banks, before adding more hopefully, “and, y’know, maybe it’d be a good Halloween costume for me, for next year?” Another thing that hasn’t changed too much is the subject matter. Cooper believes there’s still much progress to be made in terms of Black representation on TV. “There are so many Black stories that still need to be told,” he says. “In Bel-Air, we see Black people from different places and with different perspectives having uncomfortable conversations with each other. I think that discourse is incredibly important.” In fact, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was always about expanding the narrow on-screen depiction of Blackness. Medina’s real-life adoptive family had been white, but he made the TV version Black because, as he explained to Ebony magazine in 1991: “That way we could explore Black-on-Black prejudice as well as Black class differences.” The writers of the sitcom were mostly white, as was standard in the industry at the time, but the cast felt their voices were heard. Script changes were made “whenever we would come across moments that they wrote, that was like, ‘This wouldn’t happen … Black people don’t do this,’” said original Carlton actor, Alfonso Ribeiro in the reunion special. “[That] was what made this show special, because we made sure that we were authentic every episode.” OG fans and recent re-watchers may remember the show’s frequent moments of political engagement, such as Aunt Viv’s reaction to Will’s Malcom X T-shirt in season one – “You can wear the T-shirt, you can put up the posters … but unless you know all the history behind it, you’re trivialising the entire struggle.” Or the time when Jazzy Jeff refused to lower his hands to testify in court: “Dude’s got a gun. Next thing you know I got six warning shots in my back.” So it is testament to the sitcom’s legacy that Bel-Air has room to go further still. For instance, while it’s easy to imagine the Bel-Air scene in which Carlton (Olly Sholotan) and Will fall out over the N-word appearing in the 90s show, it’s harder to imagine how they could have mined the same emotional depths back then, without being cut short by a punchline or a move to commercial break. Then there are the subtle but significant shifts in characterisation. In the 90s, the wider Black diaspora was represented by Geoffrey, a Jeeves to Will’s Wooster, played – very properly indeed – by the Saint Lucia-born, Surrey-residing Joseph Marcell. Now Geoffrey is played by Jimmy Akingbola. He’s no longer posh, but still a commanding presence, as a smart-casual, iPad-wielding “house manager”. Akingbola’s depiction of Black British masculinity is one that would not have made sense to US audiences, prior to Idris Elba and Daniel Kaluuya reaching the heights of Hollywood’s A-list. “Woo! He’s cold isn’t he?” agrees Banks, with an admiring chuckle. “And you know what? Jimmy’s been so adamant and so meticulous to depict the Black British experience differently than that perception from an American standpoint, which is that all British people speak the Queen’s English.” Bel-Air is in many ways a faithful heir to the Fresh Prince’s throne, but the kingdom all around is changing. Now social media exists to pick up what the show puts down, and Banks is already eagerly anticipating what comes next: “I know Black Twitter’s going to take to it, and that’s the thing we need to do, that’s how we move forward as society; we need to start having difficult conversations.” Bel-Air will be on Peacock from 14 February on Sky and NOW",Arts/Television & radio,"‘This show basically raised me’: meet Jabari Banks, the new Fresh Prince of Bel-Air",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/04/this-show-basically-raised-me-meet-jabari-banks-the-new-fresh-prince-of-bel-air
2/4/2022,"The only hat I own is a beanie, and I wear a gold chain rather than pearls. I don’t match my coat to my dress or my bag to my shoes and I wouldn’t be seen dead in sheer tights. Yet the Queen is, without a shadow of a doubt, my ultimate fashion icon. My style crushes come and go, but I bow down to Her Majesty. Is it treason to call one’s monarch a badass? Sorry, ma’am, but it’s true. At 95, she still rocks more hot pink than a Molly Goddard catwalk show. Why stick to tasteful neutrals, when you can wear chartreuse tweed with yellow tulips on the matching hat, as she did in London last spring? When I am old I shall wear purple, as the poem goes. How about purple, lemon, lime, royal blue and emerald? The royal wardrobe has been serving up pop-art colours since silkscreen portraits were just a twinkle in Andy Warhol’s eye.  There are many style lessons to be learned from the Queen, but the first is the power of colour. The Queen has made head-to-toe colour, in every shade of the rainbow, her signature look. Colour brings a tiny dopamine hit of surprise to every public appearance. It spotlights her as the centre of attention in any scene, but is cheery and accessible rather than fancy. If Farrow & Ball neutrals are the coded status symbols of a certain class and culture, the Queen’s bright coats and dresses are the paint-pot shades of every nursery school in the land. The second style lesson is that a great wardrobe is never about trends. No one has played the long game better, carving out a formula that can be dressed up or down. Clothes say who you are before you have spoken a word, which is why people who stay true to a signature style are those whose looks we remember. If you stick to a formula, you can have fun with clothes without looking flighty. The Queen rarely looks sombre, unless the occasion specifically calls for sobriety, yet no one would mistake her for anything but a serious person. A tight focus on one look – whether it’s prim tweeds, or a white shirt and old jeans – will always say strength of character. Good style doesn’t come between you and what you need to get done. The third lesson from the royal playbook is that clothes should help you do your job, never hinder it. In case you were still under the impression that style icons had to wear heels, I point you to Her Majesty’s favourite black loafers, the most useful all-purpose shoe in existence. The Queen also uses her handbag to communicate. I’ve heard that putting it on the table indicates she would like to leave dinner, and moving it from her left hand to her right signals that she would like an exit from a conversation. If anyone can figure out a way to make this system work without a bevy of aides, please do write in, as it sounds super helpful. But while I’m waiting, I will flag that the Queen’s diplomacy-by-diamonds approach – match the brooch to the state banquet, that sort of thing – can be utilised in a low-key way by us common folk. I would never, ever go to a party of the standing around making small-talk kind without wearing at least one piece that doubles as a conversation card. (My go-to: a pair of vintage Dolce & Gabbana chandelier earrings, made from farfalle pasta shapes cast in resin.) There are as many lessons from the Queen’s wardrobe as she has had years on the throne. I could go on. I won’t – but I hope she will.

2/4/2022,"He was supposed to be Spotify’s biggest acquisition, one who would transform the music streaming company into a one-stop shop for all kinds of online audio. But controversy over “misinformation” on Joe Rogan’s podcast precipitated a hellish week for the Swedish firm as high-profile boycotts, a social media backlash and a share price drop challenged the viability of its meteoric growth.  With questions mounting over whether streaming companies pay artists their proper due, a second and arguably bigger issue has emerged: whether Spotify can be held responsible for all of the material on its platform. The row started when a group of more than 250 US professors and public health officials called on the company to crack down on Covid-19 misinformation after an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience included “several falsehoods” about vaccines. Later, when Neil Young issued an ultimatum to Spotify to remove either his music or Rogan’s podcast from its platform, the company chose to back Rogan, whose podcast is its most popular, with an estimated audience of 11 million. Despite an apology from Rogan, in which he pledged more balanced and better-researched content, and a decision by Spotify to add content advisories to episodes discussing Covid, there were a slew of further boycotts, including from Joni Mitchell, Nils Lofgren, India Arie, and the podcasters Roxane Gay and Brené Brown. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who have a podcast deal with Spotify, said they had previously raised the issue of misinformation with the company. On the same day that Spotify staff were reportedly up in arms about the chief executive Daniel Ek’s defence of Rogan, there was an intervention from the White House calling on it to “do more”. But when Spotify paid a reported $100m (£73m) in 2020 for an exclusive licensing deal with Rogan, known for his brash and often polarising content featuring members of the so-called “intellectual dark web”, it made a value judgment that the boost to revenue was more attractive than avoiding any future controversy. At the time, Spotify had begun to assert itself as a key player in the podcast world, buying up rights to more and more shows, including from the Obamas. It has now spent more than $1bn on podcasts, with revenues from podcasts up 627% year on year. “To be frank, had we not made some of the choices we did, I am confident that our business wouldn’t be where it is today,” Ek is reported to have told staff this week. According to Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Midia Research, “Spotify with Joe Rogan is where Netflix was with House of Cards. It’s original audio content.” He explained that when Spotify got going, “radio basically owned the rest of the audio business, but in the intervening years podcasts have become much bigger. If it wasn’t doing podcasts, other companies would take some of its listening time away.” Spotify, he added, “doesn’t own the music catalogue, it’s entirely dependent on record labels. A podcast is a way of saying ‘we’ll invest in our own content and we’ll generate a much higher profit from that content’.” The debate has become larger than Spotify itself, touching on the cornerstones of today’s culture wars such as free speech and censorship. MailOnline ran an article headlined “Why Spotify must stand up to the luvvie bullies trying to stifle free speech – especially if Meghan and Harry join the Joe Rogan witch-hunt”. Another in the Hill read: “Can Joe Rogan save free speech?” Andrew Hartman, the author of A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars, said the dustup was the latest in “a long list of controversies over pop culture and censorship, with capitalism and commerce in the mix.” Most of these battles, Hartman said, had historically entailed efforts by conservatives, often religious conservatives, to censor liberals wishing to express transgressive views – for example, efforts to censor Martin Scorsese’s Last Temptation of Christ. “Now we have liberal musicians working to kick Joe Rogan off a platform for expressing or giving voice to views that are seemingly conservative,” he said. All of which leaves Spotify facing a heady cocktail of crises. The UK’s competition watchdog recently launched a study of whether streaming services such as Spotify hold excessive power, after a scathing report by MPs called for a “complete reset” of a model in which they said only big labels and superstar acts profit. “It’s like waiting for a bus,” Mulligan said. “Suddenly, many crises will come along at the same time. Arie removed her catalogue because of an episode Rogan did on race. Now more and more artists will be looking at all the other stuff he’s said, and other podcasts Spotify is supporting, and think: is this the place I want my music?” But comparing and contrasting streaming companies is difficult business. Since leaving Spotify, Young has directed his fans to use Amazon Music to stream his songs – a company criticised for its treatment of workers. His music remains on YouTube, which factcheckers say is a major conduit of fake news. “Surely there is misinformation on YouTube, Apple and Amazon, much of it worse than Rogan’s show – why are these artists not withdrawing from them too?” said David Hesmondhalgh, a professor of media, music and culture at Leeds University. While Spotify continues to retain more paying subscribers than any other audio streaming service (more than 406 million monthly users and 180 million paying subscribers), its market share is declining. This week the company’s shares briefly fell as much as 18% after it forecast current-quarter subscribers lower than expectations. “If I was Spotify I’d be more worried about that than about the Joe Rogan debacle,” Mulligan said. “The attention economy – how much time we spend with stuff – was peaking before lockdown and then boomed when everybody had a lot more time on their hands. That was always going to start receding when normal life resumed.”",News/Technology,How $1bn push into podcasts led to Spotify’s growing pains,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/04/spotify-crises-podcasts-culture-wars-competition-concerns
2/4/2022,"Twenty-eight months after it began in a clandestine shipyard deep in the Brazilian Amazon, one of the more unlikely criminal voyages of all time came to an end on Tuesday with the seven sentences handed down by a court in north-west Spain. Agustín Álvarez, a 31-year-old former Spanish amateur boxing champion, was jailed for 11 years for piloting a semi-submersible “narco-submarine” carrying 3,068kg of cocaine worth an estimated €123m (£104m) across the Atlantic. His two crewmates, Ecuadorian cousins Luis Tomás Benítez Manzaba and Pedro Roberto Delgado Manzaba, received the same sentence, while four Spaniards who conspired with Álvarez to help guide the sub ashore were jailed for between seven and nine years.  Not surprisingly, the case, a wildly improbable but true saga involving the Colombian Gulf Clan cartel, a bespoke 21.5 metre-long fibreglass boat christened Che, a pair of telltale pants and several miraculous escapes during the 27-day, 3,500-mile odyssey from Brazil to Spain, has made headlines around the world since the vessel was scuttled in a Galician cove on 24 November 2019. A little over two years later, the story of the first fully laden drug “sub” detected in European waters has given rise to a new “sub-genre” of Galician narco-chronicles. Last month, Javier Romero, a Voz de Galicia journalist who specialises in drug crime, published Operation Black Tide, a meticulously researched, 313-page account of the the epic yet doomed enterprise. At the end of February, a drama inspired by the case, also titled Operation Black Tide, will begin on Amazon Prime Video. The fictional series will be followed in March by a four-part documentary on the same platform, called, inevitably, Operation Black Tide: The Suicidal Journey. Romero remembers rushing down to see the boat that Sunday morning after a police source tipped him off about its discovery. He arrived at the Ría de Aldán beach, where, coincidentally, both he and Álvarez had spent their childhood summers, to see the sunken outline of Che, its grey prow emerging half a metre above the water. “One day, a narco-sub appeared on our coast – the first in Europe,” says the reporter. “How is that not going to grab your attention? It was just another level of drug trafficking.” At the time, however, neither Romero nor the police knew much about the craft and its crew. The vessel’s arrival in Galicia had been a hastily improvised “plan C” put together as fuel ran out and after two previous attempts to rendezvous with cartel boats off the coast of the Iberian peninsula had fallen through. In desperation, and exhausted after a crossing that had lasted very nearly twice as long as planned, Álvarez turned to three childhood friends from his home town of Vigo in the hope they would help bring him, his crew and the cocaine to safety. But neither the rescue, nor its subsequent rewards, were ever to materialise. An international police operation involving the UK National Crime Agency and officers from Spanish, Portuguese and US agencies meant the authorities were waiting for Che’s arrival in Galicia. The South American cousins – who could barely swim – were arrested shortly after the boat was scuttled, while Álvarez was arrested after hiding in a nearby abandoned house for five days. Romero, who spent two years researching the case and talking to police and to some of those who knew the convicted men, eventually pieced together the fateful voyage. He learned that Álvarez had been the cartel’s second choice of captain. Their first – another Galician – had travelled to Brazil to examine the €1m craft but turned down the job after deciding it was a suicide mission. Álvarez and the Ecuadorians had fewer qualms. After leaving their Amazon base, the three spent almost a month squeezed into a dark and stinking cabin behind three tonnes of cocaine and 20,000 litres of fuel. Food was energy bars, rice, biscuits and sardines; the toilet a plastic bag. “From then on,” writes Romero, “it was nothing but constant noise, suspicion, more darkness, stenches, possible betrayals, pain, leaks, damp, grease, fear, cold sweats and communications that either failed to arrive or were perhaps intercepted.” Even today, Romero can’t fathom how the trio endured those 27 Stygian days and survived three storms, a near miss with a huge ship, and the attentions of police boats and helicopters. The book doesn’t stint on details about Álvarez’s boxing career, about semi-submersible specifications, and about how investigators concluded the secret shipyard was somewhere near the Brazilian city of Macapá after finding a pair of pants and a receipt with the name of a local shop among Luis Tomás Benítez Manzaba’s belongings. But its focus is on Álvarez and his three friends, one of whom called on his father for help, and on how friendships formed in a schoolyard eventually led to a prison yard. As Romero puts it, the story is not just about sicarios (hitmen), superstition and submarines: “It’s about how these kids – apart from Agustín [Álvarez], who accepted a lot of money for his part – have fucked up their lives.” Today, all seven are behind bars and Che itself is on show at the National Police Academy museum in Ávila, which, by accident or design, is pretty much as far inland as one can go in Spain. Romero has seen the sub for himself and is all too familiar with its dark belly. “It’s awful,” he says. “It’s claustrophobic; it’s unspeakable. It just shows how little the drug organisations care about their own people. It’s cruel. It’s just a deathtrap.” The reporter tried to interview Álvarez but his request was declined. Since his arrest, and for obvious reasons, the former boxer’s lips have remained as tightly sealed as the 153 bales of cocaine he brought across the Atlantic. But should they ever meet, Romero knows what his questions would be. “I’d ask him to tell me more about those 27 days and what they were like. How did he feel in the jungle when he saw the submarine and inspected it? Did he feel safe? Or did he feel that climbing inside it would be madness?”",News/Society," In too deep: the epic, doomed journey of Europe’s first narco-submarine",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/04/europe-first-narco-submarine-agustin-alvarez
2/4/2022,"A man who exploited a modern slavery victim found living in a squalid shed has been given a suspended prison sentence. Peter Swailes Jr, 56, was sentenced to a nine-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, at Carlisle crown court on Friday.  The victim, who has learning difficulties, had been “used and exploited” for 40 years by the defendant’s father, Peter Swailes Sr, the court heard. Over the course of his exploitation he was forced to live in a horsebox, a disused caravan and more recently in a shed on a residential site north of Carlisle. Swailes Jr pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of another with a view to exploitation on the basis that he was unaware of the victim’s living conditions. Peter Swailes Sr, 80, who died last year while awaiting trial, had denied the same offence. Swailes Jr initially denied the charge, but later pleaded guilty on the agreed basis of his “limited” involvement with the victim. The charges followed a three-year investigation by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, supported by Cumbria police and the National Crime Agency, after a man was found living in a 2-metre (6ft) shed with a soiled duvet on the floor. The victim, who was 58 years old when he was rescued, received specialist help and now lives in supported accommodation outside Cumbria.

2/4/2022,"When Viktor Yanukovych sought to flee Ukraine as he was removed from the presidency in 2014, Vladimir Putin urgently summoned the heads of his military, security, and spy agencies for an all-night meeting on how to extract him. As they broke up at seven in the morning, he recalled, he told them: “We must start working on returning Crimea to Russia.” In Putin’s telling, he was alone with his top security officials when he made one of the most fateful decisions of his political career.  Since then, Russia’s growing isolation has only strengthened the so-called siloviki, the Russian security men who have surrounded him, many of whom served in the KGB and have maintained conservative, often conspiratorial political views. We do not know exactly how Putin makes his most important political decisions. Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of political analysts R.Politik, recently divided the Russian elite into two groups: technocrats who dominate government but “have no remit to interfere in security matters” and the siloviki who “dominate the agenda, fuel Putin’s anxieties and provoke and escalate tension”. As Russia gathers troops and appears ready to launch an attack in Ukraine, these security advisers may have an outsize effect on what happens next. Nikolai Patrushev The head of Russia’s security council and a “hawk’s hawk”, Patrushev plays the informal role of Putin’s national security adviser. A career intelligence officer, Patrushev has known Putin since the 1970s, when the two men worked together in the Leningrad KGB. He later succeeded Putin as head of the FSB and has chaired the security council since 2008. His interviews have revealed him as a conspiracy theorist who believes that western powers are seeking to destroy Russia. The United States “would much rather that Russia did not exist at all. As a country,” he said in a 2015 interview. His rhetoric on Ukraine, which he calls a “protectorate” of the west, has resembled that of Putin. “At any moment, there’s potential in Ukraine for an outburst of tensions so strong that millions of Ukrainians will flee to seek refuge in other places,” he said in a recent interview that predicted a possible conflict. Patrushev has also been accused of approving assassinations and other illegal operations. A UK public inquiry in 2016 found that “the FSB operation to kill [Alexander] Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr Patrushev”. And diplomatic sources have told the Guardian that the Russian operatives accused of trying to overthrow the government of Montenegro in 2016 were allowed to leave the country on Patrushev’s plane. He also chairs the Russian volleyball federation. Sergei Naryshkin The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Naryshkin is reportedly a former KGB officer and has known Putin since at least the 1990s, when the two worked at the St Petersburg mayor’s office. Naryshkin is a Putin loyalist who followed the Russian leader into the Kremlin, serving as his deputy head of economic development from 2004, then as the head of Dmitry Medvedev’s presidential administration from 2008, and then the chairman of the State Duma parliament from 2011-2016. He is an effective functionary and polished speaker who has occasionally been suggested as a potential successor to Putin. Naryshkin is also a hardliner who engages in conspiracy theories. In an interview earlier this year, he said that the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was a western plot to support the Russian opposition by finding a “sacrificial victim”. Earlier this year, he compared the government of Ukraine to “Hitler’s occupation”. He also has an edge: asked if he had ever been betrayed, he told an interviewer that “one thing soothes me: these traitors have either already burned in the fires of hell or will certainly do so”. He heads the Russian Historical Society, which has played an aggressive role in promoting favourable interpretations of Russia’s history, a pet project of Putin’s. Alexander Bortnikov The head of Russia’s FSB, the domestic security and intelligence service, Bortnikov plays a key role in maintaining Putin’s control of the country. The sprawling security apparatus employs hundreds of thousands of people and is responsible for everything from counter-terrorism to border security, counterintelligence, electronic surveillance and, unofficially, terrorising the political opposition. Bortnikov has also known Putin since the 1970s, when both served in the Leningrad KGB. He is seen as having less influence on Putin than Patrushev or Naryshkin. Bortnikov and Patrushev’s sons have become powerful Russian officials. Dmitry Patrushev is Russia’s minister for agriculture and Denis Bortnikov is the deputy president and chairman of the state-run VTB Bank’s management board. US lawmakers have included both on draft lists for sanctions because of their fathers’ proximity to Putin. Sergei Shoigu Shoigu did not serve in the KGB or the military and his role as minister of defence makes him as much a technocrat as a silovik. But his oversight of the modernised Russian military, including the aggressive GRU military intelligence agency, means that he is often involved in key security decisions or at least in their implementation. It was Shoigu’s order that ended the sudden buildup of troops in March-April that first set alarm bells in Europe ringing about the potential for a new Russian invasion of Ukraine. And he has appeared in Belarus this week to oversee war games that could serve as a cover to prepare for an attack. Shoigu is from Tuva, a Buddhist republic in Siberia that borders Mongolia. Putin and Shoigu regularly take short hunting and fishing vacations in Siberia, which give Shoigu direct, unimpeded access to the Russian president. Evgeny Minchenko, a political analyst who puts together a power ranking of Russian officials, said earlier this year: “Right now, there’s only one member from the cabinet who is in the ‘politburo 2.0’. And that’s Shoigu.”",News/World news,Putin’s security men: the elite group who ‘fuel his anxieties’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/putin-security-elite-siloviki-russia
2/4/2022,"Nathan Chen insisted this was not about redemption. The world’s most dominant figure skater over the past 47 months has not spent much time dwelling on his catastrophic Olympic debut in 2018, saying that he is motivated not by the scoreboard but by treating every competition as an opportunity to showcase his hard work while trying to enjoy himself the best that he can.  But results do matter. And from the crisp opening quadruple flip of his short program in the Olympic figure skating team competition on Friday morning, it was clear the American’s struggles on the sport’s biggest stage are firmly in the past and his arc remains firmly on course for a storybook ending in next week’s main event. The 22-year-old from southern California by way of Salt Lake City put down a flawless skate to open his second Olympics and finished with a personal-best score of 111.71 – the second-highest tally of all time and a scant .11 off the world record held by Yuzuru Hanyu, the Japanese superstar who is Chen’s primary rival in the men’s singles and did not compete on Friday. The Americans are off to a flying start thanks to Chen in their chase for a third straight medal in the team competition, a lead that held up through the rhythm dance and the pairs’ short program. “Any time you skate a good program whether it’s in practice or competition, it feels good,” Chen said afterward at the Capital Indoor Stadium. “It feels great to be able to have a short program that I actually skated well at an Olympics. I’ll take as much as I can from this experience and then take it day by day here.” Chen, a junior at Yale who has taken a leave of absence from his studies to focus on the Olympics, has gently pushed back on the redemption narrative throughout the run-up to Beijing, preferring to frame his journey in terms of personal fulfillment. But there’s no question that Friday’s mesmerising performance to Puccini’s La Boheme, which included a gravity-flouting quad lutz-triple toe loop combination, will help turn the page on his greatest disappointment. Four years ago, Chen arrived in Pyeongchang on a tailwind of hype as the joint-favorite with Hanyu. Inside, he was a ball of nervous energy. His error-prone performance in the team event – where he ultimately helped the Americans claim a bronze medal – presaged a nightmarish short program in the men’s singles where he tumbled to the ice on his opening quadruple lutz, failed to complete his required combination and was unable to land a single jump cleanly. Not even a redemptive, personal-best long program that netted the highest free-skate score in the field could lift him into medal position. Instead, Chen settled for fifth overall while Hanyu became the first men’s skater to defend an Olympic gold in 66 years. “I think you learn the most from your mistakes,” Chen said on Friday. “And I certainly learned a lot from that competition. I don’t think I’d be able to be here where I am now without having had that experience. So I think rather than that being a demon, it was a very helpful learning experience.” Since then, Chen has dominated the circuit like few skaters in recent memory – topping the podium in three straight world championships, three head-to-head meetings with Hanyu and all but one of the 17 competitions he’s entered overall – while expanding his repertoire to push the sport’s outer technical limits. Even on the rare occasions when the American has stumbled, he has roared back with ferocity and verve. When he fell in competition for the first time in two years on a quadruple lutz during his short program at last year’s worlds in Stockholm to fall into third place, Chen responded with a sublime free skate peppered with no fewer than five four-rotation jumps to win by more than eight points. “As much as I can, I try to stay present,” Chen said. “Be within every second basically, try not to think too far in the future, don’t look too far into the past. Although that might be hard, it’s always good for everyone to sort of try to stay present.” Having done his part for country in the team event – which continues on Sunday with the women’s short program and men’s free skate and concludes on Monday with the pairs, ice dance and women’s free skates – Chen’s focus will turn to next week’s showdown with Hanyu, who enters the Olympics under a cloud of uncertainty after missing the entire Grand Prix season due to an injury suffered in a November training fall. But cast the 27-year-old Japanese star as an underdog at your peril: Hanyu’s knack for raising his level when the lights burn brightest makes the climax of their six-year rivalry – starting with Tuesday’s short program and ending with Thursday’s free skate – one of the must-watch events of the coming weeks. “I’m honored to be alive at the same time as him,” Chen said of Hanyu. “It’s pretty crazy what he’s doing and I’m looking forward to being able to see him again in person. It’s been a really great adventure and journey for me to be able to have someone like him to share the ice with and certainly he’s just been a great inspiration to me.”",Sport/Sport,Nathan Chen lays Olympics marker down with flawless short program skate,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/nathan-chen-lays-olympics-marker-down-with-flawless-short-program-skate
2/4/2022,"Parents of men killed by Tajikistan forces have called on the international community to step in and urgently protect ethnic groups being targeted by the Tajik regime. In a rare interview, families from the Pamiri ethnic minority have demanded that soldiers who killed their sons be brought to justice and urged the UN to prevent a new phase of conflict in Tajikistan, a landlocked country in central Asia.  The president of 28 years, Emomali Rahmon, is seen by the Pamiri people as wanting control of the autonomous province of Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO). “We want justice and the truth about why our children’s blood was spilt,” said Abdulmuminova Pevistamo Aqdodovna, 65. Her son, Ziyobekov Gulbiddin, 29, was killed on 25 November last year by Tajik security forces during an operation in the village of Tavdem, in GBAO province. The Tajik authorities said Gulbiddin, who was the subject of a criminal investigation for allegedly harassing a Tajik prosecutor, resisted arrest and was killed in a shootout. But witness accounts and mobile phone footage, published weeks after, appear to show him being arbitrarily executed. After the incident, relatives and neighbours took the body to the central square of Khorog, the capital of GBAO, where there was a spontaneous demonstration of several thousand people. During the protest, two more men, Gulnazar Murodbekov and Tutisho Amirshoev, were killed and 17 others injured when government forces reportedly opened fire on the protesters. “The situation is becoming unbearable,” said Aqdodovna. “The government must explain to us why this happened. Our sons did nothing wrong. They weren’t criminals. They were innocent.” After the protests, authorities visited the homes of the victims’ relatives, the mothers of the dead men claimed, with threats that, if they did not follow the police orders, the same fate would befall them. “There is no justice here,” said Amirshoeva Amchigul Tutishoevna, 50, the mother of Tutisho Amirshoev, who was killed. “People no longer trust the authorities. They have lost faith in the institutions.” “I have seen the changes in my country and governments from 1957 to today,” said 90-year-old Marodbekov Dustnazar, whose son was shot dead by police last autumn. “But what’s been happening in recent months is something I’ve never seen before. My wife is paralysed, my son has died, and my grandchildren have now lost their father. The authorities accuse us of violating the law, but it is they who are violating the law and the constitution.” Conflict between Rahmon’s government and the Pamiri has continued for decades, with the minority group suffering discrimination in employment and housing and human rights abuses. The Pamir region has been the only place in the country where protesters against government oppression still take to the streets, despite the heavily authoritarian regime. Since it gained independence from the former Soviet Union, Tajikistan has been involved in a sometimes violent border dispute with neighbouring Kyrgyzstan. During the Tajikistan civil war of 1992 to 1997, thousands of Pamiris were killed, in what some human rights activists have described as “ethnic cleansing”. In 2012, during clashes seen by many in GBAO as an attempt by the Tajik government, which has little influence in the area, to bring the autonomous region under its full control, at least 40 civilians were killed. Prof Parviz Mullojanov, a senior adviser for peacebuilding organisation International Alert in Tajikistan, said the repression was yet another confirmation of the “obsession of the central government to take control of the entire country”. “It was a natural centralisation power process,” he said. “They started from the centre and gradually got rid of the independent commanders in the country, mainly in GBAO region. “While in the rest of Tajikistan the level of unemployment is about 15–18% of the population, in the GBAO it is estimated to be as much as 30%,” said Mullojanov. “Pamiris are underrepresented in the government and discriminated against within the administrative structures.” Viola von Cramon, a member of the European parliament with an interest in the region, said the EU was considering an inquiry. “We should be careful not to see the recent incidents as an isolated event.” “It goes way back,” she said. “The autocratic rule in Tajikistan and lack of the rule of law boils up the ethnic tensions. The use of excessive force and the shooting of protesters, even if they were throwing stones, is unacceptable and contributes to the spiral of violence. These events need to be urgently investigated and everyone who overstepped their authority needs to be prosecuted. “We are considering an inquiry and a resolution on the November events that still have strong ramifications – as people in GBAO are largely deprived of the freedom of expression and families of the killed are demanding justice.” During the protests, mobile and internet coverage was blocked in GBAO, which constitutes 45% of Tajikistan, with a population of nearly 230,000. The internet is still only available to state institutions and key bank staff. Security checkpoints have been reinforced, and hundreds of people who took part in the demonstrations have reportedly been banned from leaving the region. Special forces numbers have increased and, in January, Pamiri youth leader Amriddin Alovatshoyev disappeared. Alovatshoyev’s family said they were only told this week by Tajikistan’s interior ministry that he was in custody. Over the years, a number of activists have left to escape repression and arrest. At least 15 Tajik citizens have been kidnapped or have disappeared in Russia or Turkey since crackdowns on opposition in 2015 in Tajikistan. Repression in GBAO has been yet another conflict in central Asia which, in recent months, has seen an escalation of tensions. In Kazakhstan, peaceful protests in early January turned into violent unrest that left 225 people dead. Clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters in the energy-rich ex-Soviet state prompted President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to declare a state of emergency and call in help from a Russian-led military bloc. “This is actually the result of a combination of several factors, both internal and external,” said Mullojanov. “The internal factors are mainly the crisis of the existing political and economic model, which was created after the collapse of the Soviet Union. That economic system required reforms and the local government is not able to do that now. This is why we are facing such a crisis. It is like a domino effect – it started in Kyrgyzstan and then shifted to Kazakhstan, with Tajikistan and also Uzbekistan facing a similar crisis.” Mullojanov said other factors have contributed to the destabilisation of the area, such as the collapse of Afghanistan, the intensification of jihadist activity and interference from Russia and China.",News/Global development,‘We want the truth’: families of ethnic Pamiris killed in Tajikistan call for justice as tensions rise,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/04/we-want-the-truth-families-of-ethnic-pamiris-killed-in-tajikistan-call-for-justice-as-tensions-rise
2/4/2022,"The stepmother of a 19-year-old woman from Canada allegedly murdered in Essex as she visited the UK for the first time has paid tribute to her “strong, smart and witty” daughter. Ashley Wadsworth, from Vernon, British Columbia, had reportedly never left Canada before arriving in the UK in November to stay with Jack Sepple in Chelmsford, Essex, whom she had met through an online dating app. She was due to fly home to see her family this week.  Sepple, 23, has appeared in court charged with her murder and was remanded in custody. Wadsworth is understood to be a Mormon who had converted to the Church of the Latter-day Saints at the age of 18. Her stepmother, Charmaine Wadsworth, told CBC News: “We are just remembering how strong, smart and witty Ashley was – how kind she was and how she was always 10 steps ahead of all of us. She will be dearly missed by each and every one of us.” Her older sister, Hailey, wrote on Facebook: “I love you so much baby girl you’re the bestest little sister I ever could have asked for.” She had earlier said: “My poor baby sister, we will get justice baby girl, I love you so much I miss you every day your big sissy loves you.” Friends paid tribute to her, with one woman writing on social media: “My heart aches to hear this tragic news. The last time we talked we were planning to hangout right? Ashley was one of my best friends that I’ve met here in Canada. We lost a beautiful soul.” Another said: “Rest In Peace sweet girl. I remember the most beautiful, brightest; most special moments watching you grow up. I will cherish them forever.” A third wrote: “I hope heaven is everything you read about in church and more. And Ashley just know, I love you. I promise I will do my best to take care of your family for you. Till we meet again.” Sepple, of Tennyson Road, Chelmsford, is accused of killing Ashley Wadsworth at a property in Chelmsford on Tuesday. Essex police attended the address in Tennyson Road shortly after 4pm.",News/UK news,"‘Strong, smart, witty’: stepmother pays tribute to daughter, 19, killed in Essex",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/strong-smart-witty-ashley-wadsworth-stepmother-pays-tribute-to-daughter-19-killed-in-essex
2/4/2022,"The owner of the Upper Crust sandwich chain has reported a drop in sales as concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant kept customers at home but said it was hopeful of better performance as commuters return to offices. SSP Group operates fast food chains targeted at railway stations and airports, which also includes Camden Food Co, Ritazza and Burger King franchises at travel locations.  Hit hard by pandemic restrictions on travel, sales in the eight weeks from 6 December were only 57% of the equivalent in pre-pandemic 2019, the company said in a trading update. That compared with 66% of 2019 levels across October and November. Omicron was designated a variant of concern by the World Health Organization on 26 November, prompting a renewed wave of travel restrictions and concerns about the global economic recovery. SSP, which lost more than £400m in the year to September, said sales were “resilient” during December but that they had “softened” in early January. Over the first four months of its financial year, group revenues were at about 62% of 2019 levels. “The spread of the Omicron variant around the world and the subsequent government restrictions have inevitably had an impact on passenger numbers in many of our markets,” SSP said. However, the company added it was “confident in our ability to manage any short-term volatility” and “well-positioned” for the summer. It also said sales in recent weeks had been “more encouraging” as governments again sought to lift restrictions following evidence that Omicron caused proportionally fewer cases of severe Covid-19. Railway locations showed the fastest recovery, at 71% of 2019 levels, thanks to the gradual return to offices after the lifting of work-from-home guidance in England on 24 January. In the longer term, SSP will have to contend with the expected permanent increase in people working from home on one or more days a week. Fewer than two in five UK workers worked from home during 2020 even at the height of lockdowns, but of those a significant proportion is expected to maintain some of the flexibility enforced by the pandemic. SSP, which cut 5,000 jobs in June 2020 in response to the pandemic, said it had not changed its medium-term target to return to like-for-like revenues and profit margins “at broadly similar levels to 2019 by 2024”, suggesting it still expects a drawn-out recovery.",News/Business,Upper Crust owner’s sales fall as Omicron kept commuters away,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/upper-crust-owner-sales-fall-as-omicron-kept-commuters-away
2/4/2022,"Who will win? Ireland. They’ve gone quietly about their business, there doesn’t seem to be any great sense of hyperbole about them, but they beat New Zealand in the autumn, are coming strolling into the Six Nations and are red-hot favourites to beat the reigning champions.  Predicted order Ireland, England, France, Scotland, Wales, Italy. Key match? The second week is crucial and while Wales v Scotland could be pivotal, France v Ireland is blockbuster. France’s tournament begins for real then but it’s always tight and memories of Johnny Sexton’s late drop goal will still be fresh. Best player? Antoine Dupont may seem the obvious choice but has not played too much recently and there is no hiding place for him as the world player of the year. Everyone will be looking to put pressure on the most influential player in French rugby. Breakthrough player? A few possibilities – Mack Hansen, the uncapped Ireland wing, could burst on to the scene like Louis Rees-Zammit last year and on the subject of Wales, Johnny McNicholl, Taine Basham and Ellis Jenkins could take the next step up. I can’t wait for … The chance to see players smiling post-match. Unfortunately it was an enduring image of last year’s tournament when Rees-Zammit had scored that wonder try against Scotland but had to wear a mask when doing his TV interview. Who will win? France. Or Ireland. Or maybe Scotland. The championship grows more fiendishly competitive: the only certainty is that a grand slam will be a mighty achievement. Pin me down and I’ll plump for France on points difference. Predicted order France, Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, Italy. Key match? There are plenty but France v Ireland in Paris in round two will fundamentally influence the title outcome. Most important player? Johnny Sexton. As long as he stays fit, Ireland will believe they have all angles covered. Breakthrough talent? If Ulster’s James Hume gets a run he will make opposition centres sit up. I can’t wait for … Scotland v England. Tension-filled, tumultuous – and that’s just the weather forecast. A home win in front of a raucous Murrayfield crowd will put the “din” in Edinburgh. Who will win? At their best, France are a cut above every other team. They’ll win a grand slam, with one or two nail-biting last-minute victories along the way. Predicted order France, Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, Italy. Key match? France v Ireland in the second week is the showdown between the two top teams from last autumn, and unlike England and Wales, they’ve both got (mostly) fit squads to pick from. Most important player? Antoine Dupont, stand-in captain, world player of the year, and a man who can crack open the best defences. Expect him to make the difference in at least one close game. Breakthrough talent? This time last year, Melvyn Jaminet was playing in the French second division. Has landed 92% of his shots at goal, and scored 89 points, in six Tests since he made his debut. I can’t wait for … After the past two years, the first trip out and about among a crowd. The prospect of a wet and windy weekend at Murrayfield never seemed so tantalising. Who will win? Ireland. Will need a win in Paris or Twickenham but their two defeats last year were by fine margins and they have improved significantly since then. Predicted order Ireland, France, England, Scotland, Wales, Italy Key match? England v Ireland. Can’t see a grand slam this year but there’s every chance both sides will be two wins from three by their round four meeting. The victors will then take some stopping on the final weekend. Most important player? Tadhg Furlong, Ireland. When he is playing at the top of his game, Ireland tend to be doing similarly. The leading tighthead prop in the northern hemisphere and he has returned to fitness just at the right time. Breakthrough talent? Alex Dombrandt, England. Has been consistently demonstrating his rich talents at Harlequins for a while and this year’s competition will be all the better if he can do so on the international stage. I can’t wait for … South Africa to join the championship. In the meantime though, this is shaping up to be one of the most unpredictable tournaments in recent memory and with an emphasis on attacking intent it should not disappoint. Who will win? Ireland. But any of the top four could finish anywhere, bar sixth. Oh, and then there’s Wales, who are the actual champions remember. Ireland will probably lose in Paris or London. Predicted order Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Wales, Italy. Key match France-Ireland. The winner will be two from two and motoring. If France lose, they’ll probably fall apart. If Ireland win, they host Italy, then go to Twickenham. I think Ireland will win. Most important player Well, this is always a fly-half, isn’t it. Unless you’re being difficult. I already feel as if I’ve been difficult in tipping French travails (not that there isn’t ample precedent). So Sexton. Obviously. Breakthrough talent This is where you can be difficult, so I’ll go for Paolo Garbisi of bottom-placed Italy. They have spent decades trying to find a No 10. Now they have one, they need to find a team to go with him. I can’t wait for … The bleating about the state of modern rugby after the first bad game. Rugby has lots of massive, possibly terminal problems, but the spectacle on the field is better than ever.
