4/14/2022,"Germany has seized the world’s largest superyacht after “extensive investigations” determined that it is owned by the sister of the sanctioned Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov. The German federal police said on Thursday it had seized the $600m (£4.56m) Dilbar after weeks of painstaking financial investigative work exposed the yacht’s true ownership despite a complex web of “offshore concealment”. The yacht is flagged in the Cayman Islands and registered to a holding company in Malta – both tax havens favoured by the global ultra-rich to park their wealth. German authorities said they had determined that yacht was ultimately owned by Usmanov’s sister Gulbakhor Ismailova. Usmanov, a telecoms magnate who owns the £48m mansion Beechwood House in Highgate, London and the 16th-century Sutton Place estate in Surrey, was sanctioned by the UK last month. The billionaire, who has had significant interests in the English football clubs Arsenal and Everton, had already been sanctioned by the EU and the US. Ismailova and another of Usmanov’s sisters, Saodat Narzieva, have also been subjected to UK and EU sanctions. The UK government said Usmanov “indirectly transferred assets to Ismailova, including leaving his sister as the only beneficial owner of the yacht Dilbar”. The EU said he “transferred considerable assets to his sister Soadat Narzieva, including a single payment or gift of $3m. He also held 27 Swiss bank accounts, holding hundreds of millions of dollars, which can be linked to her brother.” At 15,917 tonnes, Dilbar is the world’s largest motor yacht by gross tonnage, and is typically crewed by 96 people, with space for 24 passengers in 12 suites. Designed by British superyacht expert Andrew Winch, it boasts a 25-metre (82ft) indoor swimming pool (the world’s largest on a private boat), sauna and massage room, cinema – and two helipads. The 156-metre vessel, which is undergoing extensive repairs in Hamburg, Germany, was last month inspected by police. However, German authorities denied reports at the time that it had been seized. On Thursday, Germany’s Bundeskriminalamt police force tweeted that they had established that the yacht was “subject to sanctions law and was able to be legally impounded in Hamburg”.

The firm describes it as “one of the most complex and challenging yachts ever built, in terms of both dimensions and technology”. At the time of its launch, Lürssen CEO, Peter Lürssen, said: “Dilbar has the most advanced security technologies of any superyacht in the world. But the things you read about it containing an anti-aircraft missile defence system are all nonsense.”",News/Business,German police seize superyacht owned by Alisher Usmanov’s sister,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/german-police-seize-superyacht-owned-by-alisher-usmanov-sister
4/14/2022,"British Airways has apologised after it refused to allow a Ukrainian family, including an eight-year-old girl, to board a flight to the UK despite them having all the correct travel documents. The family-of-three had fled their home in Kharkiv, which has suffered some of the most intense Russian bombing, after waiting more than two weeks to be granted UK visas. They travelled 800 miles to Warsaw airport in Poland, where they were due to fly to London under the UK government’s homes for Ukraine scheme. Vira Rybalchenko, 68, lost her passport in the evacuation but was assured by the British embassy that she would be allowed to travel because she had a paper copy of the document as well as a newly issued UK visa and a Ukrainian identity card. The family passed through airport security without issue but minutes before they were due to board the flight Rybalchenko was wrongly told by British Airways staff that she could not board without her original passport. The British flag carrier admitted that this was a mistake and issued an apology to the family after being contacted by the Guardian. It said: “We’re very sorry for the genuine error made by our team when trying to follow Home Office guidance and we’ve put measures in place to ensure this doesn’t happen again. We’re making contact with the family to apologise and will be providing a full refund of their tickets.” Rybalchenko’s daughter, Hanna Zakhovaieva, said: “This was a horrible experience and my mum was absolutely shocked. I couldn’t leave my mum in Poland because she doesn’t understand the language and doesn’t know anyone or have anywhere to stay.” Zakhovaieva, 37, said her eight-year-old daughter, Sofiia, was “very traumatised” by the war and speaks to her father, Konstantin, every day in Kharkiv to make sure “he is still alive”. The family had arrived at the airport at 6am with all of their belongings ahead of the 8.25am flight to London Heathrow. Zakhovaieva, an accountant, said they were left “without explanation or apology” by British Airways after being wrongly refused permission to board. They were eventually able to board an 8pm flight to London on a LOT Polish Airlines flight after an employee at Hungarian airline Wizz Air created a temporary travel document for Rybalchenko. Zakhovaieva said she witnessed another family being turned away by British Airways staff and that it may have happened to many more. “When we spoke to the visa centre at the airport they told us that the majority of the families will be in the same situation [regarding incomplete documents] and they were shocked that BA didn’t allow us to board even though we had a visa,” she said. “They said this is a massive issue that a lot of families will face.” British Airways declined to answer how many other Ukrainian passengers had been wrongly turned away. Zakhovaieva, her daughter and mother are now living with their host family in Surrey, Kate Larmer and Charlie Boffin, who helped set up the group Farnham Homes for Ukraine to match strangers in the UK with Ukrainians fleeing the war. Tatyana Moskalenko, a Ukrainian living in Britain who helps run the group, said airlines should know that refugees are permitted to board flights as long as they have a valid visa. She said: “We’re currently helping 87 families [get to the UK] and every one of these families is missing documents, either because it was lost in the evacuation or the passport has expired. This is government guidance that they don’t need to have a valid passport to travel because they are refugees – it is sufficient if they have a visa.” British Airways has faced weeks of turmoil with scores of flight cancellations caused by IT failures and staff shortages.",News/Business,British Airways says sorry for refusing to let Ukrainian family board flight,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/british-airways-says-sorry-for-refusing-to-let-ukrainian-family-board-flight
4/14/2022,"Covid cases are on the rise in the north-eastern part of the US, as many Americans travel and gather together for spring break and religious holidays. The rise is being driven by BA.2, a subvariant of omicron which is more transmissible than its sibling BA.1, and was responsible for an estimated 86% of new Covid-19 cases nationwide last week, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). With precautions having been relaxed in many places earlier this year, experts have been looking at whether BA.2 will lead to another surge. “This is what the beginning of surges have looked like” in the past, said Julia Raifman, assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health. The rise in cases is regardless expected to result in disruptions to school and work as more people become ill. The US is now at “a key point to trigger action”, Raifman said. “If we take decisive action to reduce the transmission, then we will reduce case growth… and if we don’t, then we’re really leaving it to the virus to decide what’s next.” Case counts across America remain comparatively low, and rates are still falling in several parts of the country. But the US overall is seeing a tick upward in numbers, with an average of 30,000 people testing positive in the US each day, compared to about 26,000 last week, according to the CDC. Washington DC, where the mayor, Muriel Bowser, and the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, each declared they’d contracted Covid cases last week, has one of the highest two-week average increase. Rhode Island, Maryland, Kansas, Oregon, New Jersey, Connecticut and New York all saw more than 60% increases. Philadelphia was the first city to reinstate its indoor mask mandate on Monday, in an attempt to stave off a rise in hospitalizations, which a University of Pennsylvania model predicts may rise in coming weeks. The city will also add requirements to show proof of vaccination if cases continue rising. The White House renewed its mask mandate for public transportation for another two weeks on Wednesday. Several universities across the US, including Columbia, American, Georgetown, George Washington, Johns Hopkins and Rice, are also returning to mask mandates on campus. US hospitalizations for Covid are at record low levels, however, with 74% of hospital beds currently in use for all causes across the country. But hospitalizations can be a lagging indicator, so it’s not clear yet whether BA.2 will hit the health system hard. Deaths are holding steady at slightly above 500 each day. Doctors hope that access to treatments, including monoclonal antibodies and antiviral medications for those who are most vulnerable, may stem a rise in Covid-related hospitalizations and death. But federal funding for these medications is running out, without a new deal in place yet. Only 1.5m of a planned 10m courses of the antiviral Paxlovid, for instance, have been delivered to states and territories. Hospitalizations and death aren’t the only severe outcomes – long Covid is also a major concern, Raifman said. Official case counts are also being affected by the prevalence of home testing and the lack of affordable testing for those without insurance, she added. “We’re really going backwards in our response, even as the virus remains with us.”",News/World news,"Covid cases rise in north-eastern US, driven by the BA.2 subvariant",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/ba2-variant-covid-cases-us-rise-north-east-omicron
4/14/2022,"Boris Johnson has dodged fresh questions over the future of his leadership after being fined by police for breaking Covid laws, as a former minister suggested he should consider his position. After a third Tory MP went public with their concerns, the prime minister stonewalled queries about whether he had lost the moral authority to lead the country and said he would comment further next week. Repeatedly pressed on what action would be taken against those who held parties in Downing Street in defiance of strict lockdown rules or whether he could face further fines, Johnson said people would have to wait until the House of Commons returned from its Easter break to hear his view. “I said quite a lot about this on, I think it was Tuesday,” the prime minister told journalists at a press conference in Flydd, Kent, where he was unveiling plans to send most migrants who arrive in small boats across the Channel to Rwanda for processing. “I’ll be saying more when I update parliament, as you can imagine, next week. You’ll probably have to wait until then for me to say more on that.” A second tranche of fixed penalty notices was issued by the Metropolitan police’s Operation Hillman team on Tuesday, with Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, each forced to pay £50 for attending an illegal birthday celebration. Johnson’s allies have downplayed the seriousness of the breach, saying he was present only for nine minutes and that it was not a planned event. However, Johnson was challenged over whether he would resign if he was handed fresh fines by Scotland Yard. “I redirect you to what I said earlier on, I’m afraid that won’t give you any particular surprise,” the prime minister told the Guardian. “I said quite a lot about this earlier in the week. I think I should wait until parliament gets back to update parliament fully.” Johnson is likely to face a barrage of questions when he makes a statement to the Commons next week, including over the suggestion he may have misled parliament by assuring MPs on 1 December that “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. The date of the full publication of the Sue Gray report also remains unclear, given the Met’s ongoing investigation is preventing the senior civil servant put in charge of the Partygate inquiry from releasing details of the dozens of interviews and evidence gathered by her team. So far only a small number of Tory MPs have gone public with their concerns about the fines. But Karen Bradley, the former Northern Ireland secretary, became the latest to heap pressure on Johnson. Speaking to her local news website, StokeonTrentLive, she said: “My constituents know that I have been clear that those that make the rules must not break them, whether intentionally or otherwise. The public are right to expect the highest standards of behaviour from their leaders. “I am proud of the British values of democracy, individual liberty, mutual respect, tolerance and the rule of law and have been privileged to promote those values around the world as an MP and during my time as a government minister. But we will lose the right to promote those values if we do not uphold them ourselves.” She added: “Whilst law-breaking in Downing Street is unforgivable, I am very aware that Europe is in a precarious position and that we all need to act responsibly so as to not make the situation worse. “I will spend the next few days consulting my constituents and will decide on what action to take after listening to them. But I do wish to make it clear that if I had been a minister found to have broken the laws that I passed, I would be tendering my resignation now.” Bradley follows the Conservative MPs Nigel Mills and Craig Whittaker in criticising Johnson for breaking Covid rules, as well as a justice minister, David Wolfson, who quit on Wednesday night. The home secretary, Priti Patel, who has been far more muted in her defence of the prime minister given her role covers law and order, gave her first public comments since the fines were issued. During a trip to Rwanda, she refused to “give a running commentary as there’s an investigation ongoing”, but said Johnson had “given a very thorough and fulsome apology and should be respected for that”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson refuses to say whether he will resign over Covid fines,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/14/boris-johnson-refuses-to-say-whether-he-will-resign-over-covid-fines
4/14/2022,"The Gambling Commission is to lay down tougher rules for the industry in Great Britain after becoming exasperated by the ongoing failure of online casinos and bookmakers to protect vulnerable people and addicts. In a major shift in emphasis, the regulator will start giving operators direct instructions on how to ensure that consumers aren’t harmed, taking a prescriptive approach, instead of leaving it up to them to decide how to do so. The Gambling Commission chief executive, Andrew Rhodes, said the regulator had been forced to act because firms were “not doing enough”, despite the imminent threat of a government review of gambling laws that could lead to stricter regulation. William Hill recently revealed that it has set aside £15m to cover potential costs arising from a review of its licence by the Gambling Commission. If the regulator were to fine the bookmaker that much, it would be the highest penalty ever levied against a British operator. Online casino 888, which is in the process of buying William Hill, was fined £9.4m last month over multiple failings that led to customers racking up huge losses during the depths of the Covid pandemic. Rhodes said the regulator’s more prescriptive approach would leave firms in no doubt about what they need to do to avoid facing more penalties, the volume of which has risen significantly in recent years. “Time and time again our enforcement cases show that some operators are still not doing enough to prevent gambling harm,” said Rhodes. “These new rules, developed following an extensive consultation, make our expectations even more explicit.” “We expect operators to identify and tackle gambling harms with fast, proportionate and effective action and we will not hesitate to take tough action on operators who fail to do so.” Under the new rules, bookies and online casinos will be required to monitor a specific range of indicators that a customer is suffering harm due to their gambling, flag worrying signs and take action quickly. They will also have to put in place measures to stop themselves marketing bonus offers for customers deemed to be at risk of gambling disorder. The Gambling Commission will expect them to provide regular evidence of their progress. It plans to issue guidance on how to comply in June, before the rules come into effect on 12 September.

4/14/2022,"It’s incredible what producers can get away with on reality TV if it is done under the guise of a “social experiment”. Ever since Big Brother’s early noughties launch, the term has been used to evade scrutiny, but as the genre’s offerings get more bizarre and difficult to defend, it’s a claim that’s increasingly made. Some of the most outrageous shows have justified their existence this way. We’ve seen pseudoscience rationalise the exploratory marriages of The Spouse House, which puts 14 singles into accelerated relationships for eight weeks in the hopes of leaving the mansion engaged. Married at First Sight described its gimmick of having couples meet for the first time at the altar as a “groundbreaking experiment”. And the supposed justification of Love Is Blind, which has taken the world by storm over the past few years? According to its description on Netflix, contestants talk to each other and even get engaged without ever seeing the other person, all in the name of a “social experiment”. It is all done in the name of drama, as opposed to enlightenment. Netflix’s new show takes it a step further – by meddling in pre-existing relationships. A more surreal series from the creators of Love Is Blind, The Ultimatum: Marry or Move on – which features the same presenting duo of Nick and Vanessa Lachey – is described as “a new social experiment that pushes relationships to the next level.” We follow six couples at a crossroads – one partner has issued an ultimatum, another is unsure about the future of their relationship. Over two months, the pairs will date people from the other couples (largely in front of their partners) to determine whether they will stay together or go their separate ways. Something about it feels particularly brazen. A lot of shows include soundbites from a TV psychologist or a panel of “experts” as part of the ruse, but The Ultimatum doesn’t even bother. In fact, it comes closer than any other series in being honest about its setup catering more to the audience than the couples. Not long into the first episode, Nick offers participants and viewers a don’t-try-this-at-home disclaimer: “Psychologists agree that an ultimatum is not a good way to get somebody else to do what you want.” Finally, some honesty! His wife, Vanessa, briefly counters this with the fact that an ultimatum worked for her when she levelled one at him and they subsequently broke up, dated other people, got back together and married. But it is still a mask-off moment, an admission of what we all know; the phrase “experiment” allows them to get away with an absolutely ludicrous premise, but the audience rarely buys into it as an explanation any more. The Ultimatum is not the first show to encourage contestants to ruin their relationships in the name of pop psychology. In 2019, Singletown took five UK couples and had them spend the summer dating as singletons, watching their other half’s shenanigans on-screen. US show Temptation Island has several couples agree to live with a group of singles of the opposite sex, in order to test the strength of their relationships – including frequent video rundowns of what their partner is getting up to. These shows are especially addictive because of the high stakes. Watching couples destroy their relationships leaves you asking, mouth agape: “Why?” The answer is the same as it is in much of reality TV; manipulation. In an interview with Bustle, Temptation Island’s showrunner Scott Jeffress said that couples often believe the quacks who assure them that the show will save their union. “Any couple that comes on and says, ‘There’s no way we’ll break up, we’re in love,’ I say, bring it on,” Jeffress said. “This is a way to really test the relationship. If you truly are a match, you’ll walk away together. Usually, they buy in and say: ‘We need to try it.’” Doing so can lead to devastating consequences. Before the second episode of The Ultimatum is over, there are already tears of regret and confessions from contestants that they should have thought twice. With all the bed-hopping and saliva-swapping, you can’t help but think contestants would have been better off looking into polyamory, as in the Channel 4 show Open House: The Great Sex Experiment. Across six episodes, couples hole up in a luxury retreat to explore whether having open relationships and sex with other people can strengthen their relationship. Its “experiment” credentials are strengthened by intimacy therapist Dr Lori Beth Bisbey, who provides support and advice on how to open relationships safely and healthily. Yet it still just feels like an excuse to watch people have threesomes on telly. Truly, the greatest trick the TV gods ever pulled was convincing couples to self-sabotage their relationships in the name of science. Even though couples might believe the shows have their best interests at heart, the rest of us do not. Producers need to realise something: “experiment” is a description of these shows that rings as true as Love Islanders saying they’re on the show to find that special someone.",Arts/Television & radio,Destroying relationships in science’s name: how reality TV ‘experiments’ wreck lives,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/14/destroying-relationships-in-sciences-name-how-reality-tv-experiments-wreck-lives
4/14/2022,"Manchester United were apparently put off by Antonio Conte’s style and short spells at his previous clubs but the Italian’s relentless nature is bringing the best out of Spurs – as a team and individuals – to put them in the driving seat for Champions League qualification. Since he arrived at Tottenham things have not always gone smoothly but the hard work on the training ground is paying off. They have won six of their past seven league games during a crucial spell. Spurs have scored more Premier League goals than any other team since the turn of the year and become less reliant on Harry Kane. Before Conte’s appointment, Spurs were bottom of the table when it came to ground covered. The key to all Conte’s work is making the squad fitter because without that his methods do not work. By all accounts he is working the players harder in training than his predecessor, Nuno Espírito Santo, to fit them into his preferred 3-4-3. When I was at Chelsea I would see Conte at the training ground and he was relentless with players as he tried to make the shape right and find areas for individuals to improve. Kane is thriving under Conte; in the league he has scored 12 goals this season and created another eight, with only one goal and one assist coming under Nuno. Like his teammates, Kane appears fitter, which has reinvigorated him after a long season when you factor in the Euros. His role has not necessarily changed because he has always liked to drop deep to make the most of his passing range, but now his teammates can keep going beyond him. It is no longer just Son Heung-min doing that, meaning Kane has greater options when he finds pockets of space. That takes the pressure off him, something reflected in his performances. Spurs’ most consistent forwards have been aided by the winter signing of Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus. He is the player they have been crying out for because Steven Bergwijn, Lucas Moura and Gareth Bale have tried to fill the role but failed to produce on a regular basis. The Sweden international has fitted in well and formed an understanding with Son and Kane to reach three goals and six assists in 11 league games. Whereas Tottenham’s rivals carried out limited January transfer business, Conte let four leave and although the club signed only Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur it has paid off. Kulusevski is young and they have options to buy for as little as €30m. It is part of the business model to buy a top player for a good price, like they did with Son, and gives them time to develop him into the player they want with two top individuals in Kane and Son alongside him. There are few better at bringing about immediate improvements out of players than Conte. Look at Romelu Lukaku: he took him to Internazionale after it was obvious the Belgian was not wanted at Manchester United and made him into a striker who scored 64 goals in two seasons and was sold for £97.5m. At Spurs, he has turned Matt Doherty from a player who could not get into matchday squads under José Mourinho into a major part of his system until injury at Aston Villa last Saturday ended Doherty’s season. In 2022, Doherty has two league goals and four assists and has looked to be back to the player he was at Wolves. Going out of the Europa Conference League and FA Cup will have helped Conte because he needed time on the training ground to make the squad used to his methods. Resting players for matches on a Thursday is useful but it does mean their training week will be disrupted because a different starting XI is put into shape. Fewer games to concentrate on is better because having a full week to overload the players to get them fit and sharp allows them to peak for one match. It enables them to build preparation into that game and means there can be no excuses, and you can see that coming through. At one point it did not look as if Conte would revitalise Spurs and he implied he was willing to leave after their defeat at Burnley in late February. Conte said “maybe I am not so good”, although he has plenty of evidence to the contrary. I do not know why he said it – maybe he wanted to put pressure on the club’s hierarchy – but it seems to have worked given that the football and results have been better since. It shows he knows how to push buttons on and off the pitch. Spurs have made themselves favourites for fourth spot. Manchester United are in terrible form, Arsenal have lost their past two games, to Crystal Palace and Brighton, and West Ham’s results have dipped while juggling the Premier League and Europa League. Spurs have a north London derby to come – a home game on 12 May – and I think they will secure Champions League qualification. Of the four managers vying for fourth place, Conte is the one I would want in my dressing room, without a doubt. Spurs have form in their favour and the stamina to complete the job, all thanks to Conte proving once again that his methods work.",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte is working his magic at Spurs and it all stems from fitness | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/antonio-conte-magic-spurs-fitness-favourites-fourth-place
4/14/2022,"This monologue, by a woman from the deep south of the US who thinks she is part wolf, takes in the stretch of her troubled life and ends with the Northridge earthquake of 1994. The play, small in itself, carries its own devastating and seismic power. Maxine (Clare Latham) has a series of flashbacks that take in her progression from an abused and feral girl, beaten by her father, abandoned by her mother and left to skin rabbits, into a woman embroiled in a drug cartel and capable of dead-eyed violence. “We ain’t never innocent, not even when we’re born,” she says. “We know iss all murder and lies from when we first open our eyes.” Latham’s performance is utterly arresting, never rushed despite the febrile story she tells. Her delivery carries an innocence alongside the graphic sex and violence, and she holds us breathless over the course of the play, which is performed straight through and gathers a compulsive momentum. Her story is partly an angered growl against the world’s iniquities but also a reclaiming of sorts – a need to describe her pain but also narrate the gleaming moments of love and joy. Ché Walker, writer and director, manages to make it intimate and epic and his script is rich and literary without being florid. Sheila Atim composes the music and with Bethany Gupwell’s lighting and John Leonard’s sound design, builds a strong atmosphere. Latham speaks from the nooks and crannies of Amy Jane Cook’s scorched-earth set, which has a crack running down its centre to prefigure the final earthquake. Her story takes in bigger world politics, from the Iran-Contra affair of the Reagan era to the 1992 Los Angeles riots sparked by the Rodney King video footage. None of this feels extraneous but feeds into Maxine’s life story and adds texture to its exploration of what it means to be a poor, white, disfranchised woman in the US. It is also a study of being a woman in a violent world and what this violence does to her humanity. Her sudden transformations into a wolf, which signal her rage but also her power, are left turns into magicrealism that might have seemed strained but are mesmerising here. She has an animal femininity reminiscent of Angela Carter’s wolf women whose skins are licked off to reveal fur beneath, and there are also echoes of Clarissa Pinkola Estés’s Women Who Run With the Wolves. This fairytale element is combined with the grit and gore of the story’s southern gothic and together it creates a heady effect. If the lockdowns turned the monologue into an overfamiliar form, Wolf Cub remoulds it into something new, exciting and dangerous again.

4/14/2022,"Rightwing populist parties have a detrimental impact on climate policy, researchers have found for the first time, amid growing fears of a similar movement in the UK. The study, by the universities of Sussex and Warwick, looked at the policy of more than 25 countries over a period of more than a decade. Researchers created a climate policy index and compared it with a baseline of a centre-right government. They found the combined effect of the presence of a rightwing populist party in parliament and in government was associated with a reduction in the index of about 25% on average. But while rightwing populist parties had a negative impact on climate policy across the board, EU membership and proportional representation voting systems lessened the effect. The study’s authors, Dr Matthew Lockwood and Dr Ben Lockwood, wrote: “These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that in countries with proportional representation, where rightwing populist parties enter government they will do so as typically junior coalition partners with limited numbers of cabinet seats and a tendency not to prioritise portfolios relevant to climate policy. “By contrast, in countries with majoritarian electoral systems, when rightwing populist parties get into government, our finding is that they have a much greater influence on climate policy.” Examples of rightwing populists reversing climate policies include Donald Trump, who pulled the US out of the Paris agreement and gave support for coal. In Australia, Tony Abbott repealed that country’s carbon price. Matthew Lockwood, from the University of Sussex, said populist parties were a growing concern, owing to the cost of living crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war. “The thing about rightwing populist parties is they tend to be very reactive to crisis,” he said. “In Europe, a lot of that has been on immigration, and in the UK it has been Brexit. And these issues have gone off the boil a bit so the people who were pushing for Brexit are now in the net zero scrutiny group. It’s the same people reacting to a crisis but now pushing against climate action.” There are fears that the risk is greater in post-Brexit Britain if those who wish to delay climate action become a louder voice in government. Lockwood said: “The risk is bigger – Britain is outside the EU, we have the same sort of electoral system as places like Canada, Australia, [the] US. If a more climate-sceptic or hostile faction takes hold in the Conservative party, then that’s going to be a lot more damaging than if it happened to countries in Europe with proportional representation.” However, he believes that the UK will not necessarily end up in a similar position to other countries with right-wing populist governments. “There’s something about the history of the Conservative party that has made it more resistant to these views than the populists in Australia and US,” he said. “Look how many MPs are in the Conservative Environment Network – so I’m not saying it’s bound to happen, but we are at risk.” The Netherlands 2010 – the populist and climate-sceptic PVV party got its best ever electoral result and came in as a junior coalition partner in a centre-right led government. The scale and ambition of greenhouse gas emissions reduction and renewable energy targets set by the previous government were reduced, and a coal phaseout remained off the agenda. Norway 2013 – the populist Progress party entered a minority government. Previous centre-left coalition governments had had ambitious climate policy, but again targets for emissions reduction and renewables were reduced. The Progress party took over the ministry of petroleum and energy and issued new drilling licences for oil, including in the Arctic for the first time. Denmark 2015 – the centre-right Venstre party formed a minority government that had informal support from the populist Danish Peoples’ party, which got 21% of the vote, its best ever share. There was backsliding on emissions reduction and renewables targets, and the goal of phasing out coal set by the previous government was dropped. Poland 2015 – the populist PiS took power as the largest party in a coalition government. In its first term it was hostile to renewables, blocking onshore wind and opposing expansion of renewable energy targets at the EU level. It also blocked the 2050 carbon neutrality goal in the European Council. However, from 2019 the party changed position on renewables. Austria 2017 – the populist FPÖ came in as a junior partner in a centre-right led government.

And there’s the sort of virtuosity that Rōki Sasaki managed to conjure for two and a half unforgettable hours on Sunday afternoon at the Zozo Marine Stadium outside Tokyo. Sasaki, a right-handed flamethrower for the Chiba Lotte Marines of Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball, achieved one of his sport’s rarest feats when he retired the minimum 27 batters without allowing an opposing player to reach base in a 6-0 win over the Orix Buffaloes, racking up a record-tying 19 strikeouts in only 105 pitches. Even more remarkable: he’s still only 20 and grew up amid the wreckage of the 2011 tsunami after his house, and several family members, were swept away by the floodwaters. It was only the 16th perfect game in NPB history and the first in 28 years, but somehow that manages to undersell the grade of Sasaki’s masterpiece. There’s sabermetric-backed reason to believe that Sunday’s silencing of the defending Pacific League champions may well be the greatest game ever pitched. After coaxing a pair of groundouts to open the game, Sasaki whiffed two-time reigning Pacific League batting champion Masataka Yoshida for his first strikeout of the day. He then struck out the side in the second, third, fourth and fifth innings to set a record with 13 consecutive strikeouts, laying waste to the 64-year-old Japanese mark of nine. (No pitcher in Major League Baseball has ever fanned more than 10 in a row.) Sasaki continued to breeze through the Orix lineup into the later innings, overpowering hitters with a fastball that averaged nearly 100mph while keeping them guessing with a devastating low-90s splitter that drops off the table right as it reaches home plate. Every pitch called by catcher Kō Matsukawa, an 18-year-old fresh out of high school, the imperious Sasaki calmly whipped past the flailing Buffaloes. He struck out the side once more in the eighth and then, down to the last batter, Sasaki uncoiled his beanpole frame for the 105th and final time and fooled the reigning Pacific League home run king Yutaro Sugimoto with a diving forkball for his 19th strikeout, equalling the NPB single-game record and setting off a wild celebration near the pitcher’s mound. “This is the greatest,” a beaming Sasaki told Japan’s Kyodo news agency in the aftermath. “Honestly, I wasn’t thinking about the possibility [of a perfect game]. I figured it would be OK if I gave up a hit, so I just pitched and put my trust in Matsukawa right until the end.” Roki Sasaki attributes his historic perfect game to his 18-year-old catcher, Kou Matsukawa pic.twitter.com/qJgwCK3L1b It’s been some journey for Sasaki, whose father and grandparents were killed and house swept away in the Tōhoku tsunami that engulfed Japan’s north-east coast when he was in elementary school. It’s a tragedy that, understandably, has stayed with him. “It’s been 11 years but I cannot easily erase the agony and sadness I felt at the time,” Sasaki said last month. “I’ve been able to dedicate myself to baseball thanks to the support I’ve had. I only have the sense of gratitude to those who supported me.” Courted by scouts from at least 20 of Major League Baseball’s 30 teams during a headline-grabbing career at Ofunato High School, he opted to sign with the Marines, who selected him first overall in the October amateur draft ahead of the 2020 season. He didn’t make an appearance during his first year with the club while on “physical preparation” – a rarity for a No 1 pick that made him a target for critics – but went 3-2 with 68 strikeouts, 16 walks and a 2.27 earned run average in 11 appearances during his debut campaign last year. And now this: the first perfect game in NPB since Hiromi Makihara of the Yomiuri Giants on 18 May 1994. His sudden rise to international fame after Sunday’s contest – Sasaki’s name (#佐々木朗希) was trending on Twitter globally for several hours in the aftermath – comes at a moment when Japanese players are breaking through in the US mainstream like seldom before. This week Shohei Ohtani, the two-way LA Angels star with the once-in-a-century skillset who captured last year’s AL Most Valuable Player honors, became the first baseball player in nearly two decades to appear on the cover of Time magazine. And Seiya Suzuki, the longtime Hiroshima Toyo Carp outfielder who joined the Chicago Cubs on a five-year, $85m contract in March, is off to a historically torrid start in one of America’s biggest markets. Sasaki, who hails from the same Iwate Prefecture as Ohtani, will no doubt have US fans drooling in anticipation of whether he will follow suit. But thanks to the byzantine posting system in place between MLB and NPB, which effectively deters the world’s best players from coming to the US as soon as possible, they could be in for a long wait. Japanese players who sign with NPB clubs must accrue nine years of professional experience before they can sign as international free agents on the open market. A caveat to the system would allow Sasaki to come over as many as three years sooner, but he won’t be able to maximize his earnings until he turns 25 or finishes his sixth season in Japan. Bottom line: unless he’s willing to play for under fair market value, and that’s presuming the Marines oblige his request to be posted early, it’s unlikely his Major League Baseball debut will happen before 2027. But while MLB fans are left to daydream about the future, Sasaki is focused on what he can produce now. “The reality is slowly starting to sink in. I spent last night immersing myself in the experience,” he said on Monday. “That mark in history will always stand. A player is expected to perform throughout the season so I’m shifting gears and moving on.”",Sport/Sport,Rōki Sasaki: the 20-year-old tsunami survivor behind the greatest game ever pitched,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/roki-sasaki-perfect-game-japanese-pitcher
4/14/2022,"MPs and a human rights group have called on the UK government to repatriate a young British boy and his gravely ill mother from a detention camp in Syria, after doctors said she was at risk of dying and leaving the child orphaned. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was reviewing the case of Zaid* and his mother, Maryam* – who was injured in an explosion in Syria in 2019 and left with shrapnel in her head – “as a matter of priority”. However, despite multiple requests over several months to repatriate the family, no action has been taken. Maryam’s condition has continued to worsen and she is unlikely to survive without medical intervention, according to doctors. At least 30 British children remain in Syrian detention camps in dangerous and squalid conditions, despite warnings from MPs that there was “compelling evidence” that women and children had been trafficked. Most of the women and children in the camps were captured by Syrian Kurdish fighters, ground troops in the US-led coalition against the terror group, when fleeing IS territory after the fall of Baghouz in 2019. Al-Hawl and Roj camps in north-east Syria hold 60,000 people; half of those in detention are children aged 10 years or younger. According to Save the Children, at least 163 people died in the camps in 2021, 62 of whom were children. Last year, Danish intelligence confirmed that at least 30 children from the camps had been kidnapped and trafficked by IS, formerly known as Isis. A report out this week highlighted the worsening conditions inside the so-called “widow camps”, saying “children … have been found to be severely neglected, abused and forced to work, while mothers are at ‘breaking point’ psychologically.” The human rights charity Reprieve has been working on multiple cases of British children living in dangerous conditions in the camps, including that of Zaid, whose age cannot be given in order to protect his identity. Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, who visited the pair, said Maryam’s tent was recently set alight and Zaid was forced to drag his mother out to save them both. Arson is a common occurrence as IS followers try to break out of the camps, though there are also often accidents with stoves. The young boy now “sees fires everywhere”, and remains on constant alert, said Foa. “He refuses to play outside with other children as he is afraid that if he leaves his mother’s side, she might die.” Andrew Mitchell, Conservative MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on trafficked Britons in Syria, told the Guardian: “The government’s position is surely hard to fathom. Ministers are asking us to believe that this British woman who can barely walk is such a threat to national security that she cannot be brought back home for life-saving medical treatment with her young son. “Has the UK really become so fearful and so cruel? I urge the government not to risk making an orphan of a young British boy and bring this family home.” Last week, Germany repatriated 27 children and eight mothers from north-east Syria and in February, the Netherlands repatriated 11 children and five mothers. The UK has so far repatriated seven children but no women. The Foreign Office responded to a request for comment on Zaid’s case by saying: “There may be British children in internally displaced persons camps in Syria who are innocent victims of the conflict. Where we become aware of unaccompanied or orphaned British children in Syria, we will work to facilitate their return, subject to national security considerations.” This amounts to a policy of separating children from their mothers, argues APPG co-chair, Apsana Begum. “By choosing to separate British children from their mothers, the government is putting these women in a situation that no parent should ever have to face,” the Labour MP told the Guardian. “The fact that the government would adopt this brutish approach to tear British families apart shows everything that’s wrong with its counter-productive and unbearably callous policy towards British nationals in north-east Syria.” During the pandemic, eight children aged under five died within days of each other as humanitarian organisations’ access to the camps was reduced. Their deaths were linked to conditions such as heart failure, internal bleeding and severe malnutrition, and could have been treated. Although the government claims to assess each repatriation request on a case-by-case basis, letters with similar wording have been sent to British mothers refusing to assist them. “These letters suggest a blanket policy of offering to separate mothers from their children – something the government has previously said is wrong,” said Foa. “Any child psychologist would tell you this is incredibly damaging and the policy is also totally out of step with our international partners.” In a statement for the Guardian, Maryam’s family said: “The UK government can easily repatriate them and save their lives if they wanted. But instead, every day we expect a call telling us the worst has happened. We feel completely helpless and just want them home where we know they are safe.” Last month, more than 8,000 Reprieve supporters wrote to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, asking the government to repatriate Zaid and his mother so that she could receive the urgent medical care that she needs. * Names have been changed",News/Global development,MPs call for British child and ill mother to be returned to UK from Syrian camp,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/14/mps-call-for-british-child-and-ill-mother-to-be-returned-to-uk-from-syrian-camp
4/14/2022,"After a virtual event in 2020 and a scaled-down festival last year, the 75th Cannes film festival has announced a lineup packed full of previous Palme d’Or winners and festival favourites for what it hopes will be a return to full capacity – and maximum buzz. New films from Ruben Östlund, Hirokazu Kore-eda , Cristian Mungiu, Michel Hazanavicius and the Dardenne brothers – all of whom have already triumphed at the festival – will play in competition. Meanwhile, Croisette favourites such as David Cronenberg, Claire Denis, Park Chan-wook and James Gray will also vie for the prize. No British directors have so far been announced as having films which will play in either the official competition selection or the sidebars. But at least one film is set in the UK: Silent Twins, which stars Letitia Wright and Tamara Lawrance as June and Jennifer Gibbons, twins from the only Black family in a small town in Wales in the 1970s who are sent to Broadmoor after a crime spree. The festival will open on a gory note, with a French remake of acclaimed Japanese zombie film One Cut of the Dead by the director of The Artist. Hazanavicius’s Final Cut stars Romain Duris, Bérénice Bejo and Bejo and Hazanavicius’s daughter, Simone. The horror theme continues with Crimes of the Future, Cronenberg’s visceral body-chopping sci-fi about the future of human evolution. Viggo Mortensen plays a notorious avant garde artist who, along with his partner (Léa Seydoux), “publicly showcases the metamorphosis of his organs in avant garde performances”. Kristen Stewart is an investigator from the National Organ Registry who makes an uncomfortable discovery. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Broker is set in a world in which infants can be placed in baby boxes and dropped off anonymously to be cared for by others, while in Decision to Leave, Park Chan-wook directs the story of a detective who falls for a mysterious widow. Cristian Mungiu, whose abortion drama 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days won the Palme d’Or in 2007 returns to the festival with RMN, a long-awaited multi-strand drama set in contemporary Romania. Two-time Palme d’Or winners Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne return with Tori and Lokita, about two African refugees whose friendship is tested when they settle in Belgium. Joe Alwyn and Margaret Qualley play a couple struggling to escape the Nicaraguan Revolution in The Stars at Noon, a romantic thriller from Claire Denis. Triangle of Sadness, the latest film from Force Majeure director Ruben Östlund is a social satire about a group of celebrity fashionistas shipwrecked on a desert island along with their yacht’s Marxist captain (Woody Harrelson) and crew. Two US directors have made the cut: James Gray, whose autobiographical drama Armageddon Time about his childhood in Queens stars Anne Hathaway, Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Strong; and Kelly Reichardt, back with her fourth collaboration with Michelle Williams. Showing Up is billed as a “sharply funny portrait of an artist on the verge of a career-changing exhibition”. Judd Hirsch co-stars. Out of competition, documentaries include Ethan Coen’s study of Jerry Lee Lewis and The Natural History of Destruction, the third film by Ukrainian film-maker Sergei Loznitsa dealing with the tragedies of 20th-century European history. Previously announced is a Tom Cruise career retrospective, as well as the premiere of the belated sequel Top Gun: Maverick. The film will premiere just over a week before it opens in the US. Cruise, who turns 60 shortly after the festival at the end of May, will discuss his 40-year career at an in-conversation audience on the Croisette. Cannes’ fond relationship with blockbusters hit a peak around seven years ago with the premiere of George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road, which won rave reviews before winning six Oscars the following spring. Miller’s follow-up to that film, Three Thousand Years of Longing, starring Tilda Swinton and Idris Elba, will also screen for the first time at the festival. Nine years ago, Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby opened Cannes, repeating the trick of Moulin Rouge in 2001. This year sees the stage set for the first screening of Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley biopic, starring Austin Butler as the singer and Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker. Notable firsts elsewhere in the lineup include Saim Sadiq’s Joyland, the first film from Pakistan to make the official selection, which plays in Un Certain Regard. In the Midnight Screening section, Squid Game star Lee Jung-jae’s first film, Hunt, will premiere.",Arts/Film,"Tom Cruise, Kristen Stewart, Anne Hathaway – and Elvis – set for Cannes film festival",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/14/tom-cruise-kristen-stewart-anne-hathaway-elvis-cannes-festival-full-line-up
