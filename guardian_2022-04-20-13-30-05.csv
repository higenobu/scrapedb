4/20/2022,"Labor is warning that a return of the Coalition’s omnibus industrial relations bill will mean changes to the better off overall test, allowing pay cuts. Scott Morrison has dismissed this as “another scare campaign” following on from Labor’s claims about aged pensioners being put on the cashless debit card. What is the better off overall test (Boot), and has the government really ruled out changes that could cut pay? After extensive consultation with employers and unions, the Coalition released an industrial relations bill in December 2020 that unions mostly hated. In particular, they singled out a clause allowing the industrial tribunal to approve pay deals that did not leave workers better off overall if it is “appropriate” to do so, given the impact of Covid-19 on business. The clause was subject to some safeguards including needing majority support from employees, and that the exception to the better off overall test would be phased out after two years. But Labor, unions and independent academics warned the change was a recipe for pay cuts, with deals struck in the two-year window to have effect for up to four years, long after the economy had bounced back from the pandemic. The then-industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, ditched the provision in February 2021. The government later gutted its own bill, removing provisions to criminalise wage theft and passing only minor changes to rules around casual work. On Saturday, the prime minster said the industrial relations bill was “absolutely” still its policy and the government expected to put it forward in the new parliament. On Tuesday Morrison added that a separate bill would lengthen pay deals for new work sites from four to six years. The industrial relations minister, Michaelia Cash, also revealed the Coalition would aim to double the penalties for breaches of industrial law, in a bid to crack down on the militant construction union. The problem the government has created for itself is that Morrison’s support for the industrial relations bill was ambiguous: is it intending to introduce the original version of the bill, or the one with the contentious exception allowing pay cuts removed? Labor went on the attack, claiming that suspending the operation of the better-off-overall safeguard could mean cuts of $10,000 a year for retail managers, $14,000 for a part-time disability care worker losing penalty rates, or $7,000 for a butcher. The shadow industrial relations minister, Tony Burke, said Morrison had “made clear that omnibus bill is returning and this is what it says”. “It allows for a pay cut … Your hourly rate of pay can’t be cut, but every loading, every shift penalty, every overtime rate can be cut.” On Wednesday, Cash put out a statement that tried to put the issue to bed: “The Morrison government is not changing the better off overall test – full stop.” But Morrison then muddied the waters, telling reporters in South Australia that “there are no major changes to the Boot at all”. Asked what changes to the Boot there are if not “major” changes and whether the pandemic exception could apply, Morrison said: “The pandemic has now passed. There are emergency measures that obviously no longer have an application when not in an economic emergency environment. “And so the measures that I have already articulated to you and that are set out well in the legislation, I think, are very clear.” The problem with this is: there are still businesses affected by the pandemic, and the bill didn’t set a high enough threshold to say it would only apply in “emergency” circumstances. It would be up to the industrial tribunal to decide if the exception applies, unless the government commits not to legislate it. The bill clarifies that non-monetary benefits can be considered in the better off overall test, a move that might help fast-food giants trim penalty rates in return for giving employees food. The bill would also allow part-time employees covered by the 12 awards in the retail, food and accommodation industries to work extra shifts at ordinary rates – without the overtime loading, which unions argue will cut take-home pay of people who should be classed as casuals. Unions are also concerned that tying pay rises on new work sites to the national minimum wage will cut pay. Despite Cash’s claim of no change to the better off overall test, Morrison’s comments leave open the possibility of legislating an exception that would allow pay deals that cut workers’ pay. If this is not what he intended, the government should simply say this section will be removed from the bill, as Porter did in February 2021. Combined with the other sections that affect take-home pay, there is a basis for Labor to argue the bill’s return will cut pay.",News/Australia news,Factcheck: has the Coalition really ruled out industrial relations changes that could cut pay?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/factcheck-has-the-coalition-really-ruled-out-industrial-relations-changes-that-could-cut-pay
4/20/2022,"Even Vladimir Soloviev, a state TV host, was having trouble swallowing the loss of Russia’s flagship cruiser Moskva last week as he took aim at a rare target: the Russian military. “You just tell me how you were able to lose it,” he said in an extended temper tantrum on his talkshow, one of Russia’s most popular. “Tell me, what the hell were you doing in that particular area of the Black Sea at that moment?” Soloviev remains pro-Putin and pro-war. But the rare outburst has pointed to how the stress of Russia’s war in Ukraine has grown as the invasion enters its third month, with both sides announcing a “new stage” in the conflict in the “battle for Donbas”. Kremlin officials have shown no signs of contrition. Vladimir Putin decorated the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade for its “mass heroism and courage” after the same unit had been accused by Ukraine of committing war crimes in Bucha. But as the cost of the invasion has grown, some unlikely critics of the war have also grown more outspoken. “I don’t see a SINGLE beneficiary of this mad war!” wrote the outspoken businessman Oleg Tinkov in a statement on Tuesday. “Innocent people and soldiers are being killed. Generals have woken up from their hangover to understand they have a shit army. And why would the army be good, if everything else in the country is shit and rife with nepotism, lackyism, and servility? “Dear ‘collective west’, please give Mr Putin a clear exit to save his face and stop this massacre.” Russian MPs have suggested charging him with discrediting the Russian armed forces. On both sides of a polarised Russian society, the failures of the first stage of the war have raised the stakes of the conflict, turning what the Kremlin calls a “special operation” into an existential one. “We are seeing that the fate of Putin, Russia and society as a whole is being merged into one,” said Greg Yudin, a sociologist. “I hear more often that while people think the war might have been a mistake, they say there is no way back; they say ‘we’ve got to finish the job.’” Marina Litvinovich, an opposition activist and politician who has remained in Russia, said she saw the war as a stress test for the government that threatened to bring down the “colossus with clay feet” that Putin had built over 20 years in power. But among ordinary Russians, she also sees clear signs of war fatigue brought on by a flood of information from the early days of the invasion. Apathy is on the rise. “I see people becoming used to the war,” said Litvinovich. “From some kind of nightmare or horror, the war has become ordinary for many.” People were “emotionally burnt out”, she said, and were increasingly turning away from the news even as the failures onboard the Moskva cruiser were exposed. Meanwhile, the early economic shocks of the war had passed for many, and few were looking to the economic recession to come. “Right now there’s this kind of false sense that life has normalised,” she said. “People think that the economic difficulties have passed.” The government has taken extraordinary steps, including the introduction of capital controls, to prevent an economic collapse. Maxim Reshetnikov, the head of Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development, claimed on Tuesday that the country had “withstood the first blow of sanctions”. But within the business community, there are clear signs of distress, as international companies continue to exit Russia on a daily basis. The Moscow mayor has predicted the loss of 200,000 jobs, proposing that out-of-work professionals can be retrained or temporarily employed, including doing “socially important” work in parks. Several big names have voted with their feet. The Russian business daily Vedomosti reported on Monday that Lev Khasis, a former senior executive at the state-owned Sberbank, had left the country for the US. But government officials have mostly remained in their posts. Temporary work stoppages at some large factories have not led to the kind of economic protests that the Kremlin is truly concerned about. “Putting aside personal positions about the war (some are for, some are against), people are mobilising and working as hard and creatively as possible,” a senior director for a major metals company said. “They understand that they need to give it their all for the company and themselves to survive.” New polling from the independent Levada Centre has indicated that Russian views on the west in particular grew more negative in March, likely due to sanctions and vocal western support for Ukraine. Those thoughts have largely been encouraged by Russian state media, where remarks that would have been considered fringe and genocidal, including calls for the erasure of Ukrainian culture, have increasingly been made on print and in primetime. “There are a lot of people who actually believe in this stuff,” said a senior manager in a state news agency. “And even if not, any Russian person at our level is apoliticised. It’s not for us to analyse the decisions … made by the bosses.” The Kremlin may want to finish the war as soon as possible, aiming for 9 May Victory Day, which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany. “But judging by the way the operation is going, he may prolong the hostilities, and 9 May will be just a day to achieve intermediate goals,” said Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre.",News/World news,Russia’s latest military failures polarise society even more,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/russias-latest-military-failures-polarise-society-even-more
