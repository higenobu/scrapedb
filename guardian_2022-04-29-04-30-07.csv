4/29/2022,"It’s only a short walk from the ECB headquarters out of Lord’s, but it took Rob Key a long time to complete it after he’d finished his first press conference as the managing director of the England men’s team. He was stopped by a Middlesex fan who wanted him to record a good luck message for a friend’s wedding, another who asked him to pose for a selfie, a gaggle of kids who wanted his autograph, a teacher who asked him to take a group photo with her class, and a steward who just wanted to wish him well in his new job. “Good luck Rob!” the steward said. “You’ll need it!” You guess a lot of his conversations end that way these days. The ECB still don’t have a chairman. They just announced that they are restarting the recruitment process because they haven’t been able to find anyone who meets the criteria. They still don’t have a head coach or head selector for their men’s team, who are bottom of the World Test Championship table and are due to play a Test series against New Zealand, the world champions, in 35 days. They are also waiting on two major reviews – one into the culture of their teams and another into the structure of their cricket, commissioned by a chief executive who has intimated that he may step down before they’ve reported. Key’s plan is to lead them out of this mess one step at a time. He has already picked his skipper and says he is confident that he will be able to hire a coach in time for the first Test. After that he will appoint a head selector too, unpicking one of the key decisions made by his predecessor, Ashley Giles, who folded the role into the head coach’s remit. Key doesn’t have any idea yet who it might be – “We won’t rush it, because I’d rather have someone really good” – and in the meantime he’ll help pick the team himself. But his main worry is making sure he gets the best people in these three jobs. “Then we’ll build the structures around them.” Key has the knack of making it all sound very simple. He speaks in plain English, which is a help, and manages to get through the best part of an hour’s talking without taking any positives, or executing any skills, or mentioning any of his key performance indicators or delivery networks. “You’re not trying to solve climate change or anything like that,” Key says. “Just make the best possible decisions on cricket, manage people to the best of your ability and make sure everyone’s on the right track. There’s not much else.” He suggests that England’s thinking got overcomplicated during the pandemic, and he’s right. Of course he wants Ben Stokes to be captain, because he was the obvious choice, and of course he wants Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to be in the squad, because they’re the best bowlers available – “and in Test cricket, if there’s one thing we’ve got to do it’s pick our best team”. As for rotation and the rest: “I don’t think we have to overthink all this stuff. If they play the first Test match and if they’re bowling really well and England are doing well, then they might play the next and then if they bowl well in that one, then on to the next and then if they’re tired then someone else can come in.” Likewise, if the schedule means there are times when players have to miss some white-ball cricket to ensure they’re in the best shape to play Test matches, so be it. “But I’m not going to tell you that they are not going to play a game in six months. We’ve just got to be flexible about it.” Trouble is, events have a way of making everything more complicated. Key got a taste of it when he made an off-the-cuff remark about Nottinghamshire’s Joe Clarke, whose friend and teammate Alex Hepburn was found guilty of rape in 2019. There are plenty of cricket fans who haven’t forgiven Clarke for his role in the case, and the messages he sent Hepburn on WhatsApp. Key found he had talked himself into a corner where he had to extemporise an answer about whether or not Clarke should be picked for England. “I’ll have to look into exactly what’s gone on in the past, but for me, I see no reason why not.” There are plenty more hard questions ahead, and they’ll need sharper answers. Behind all that straightforward talk about taking it one step at a time, Key did sound a bit like a man who is figuring the best way ahead as he walks along. He says he’ll be guided by the principle “do what’s best for English cricket”. But, as he said himself, the ECB is, and always has been, full of people trying to do exactly that. And they still ended up in this position. The test of Key’s ability will be whether he gets those decisions right or not. He says that’s what drew him to the job. After all those conversations on Sky about how the ECB ought to run the game, he wanted to see whether his ideas about the Test team, the domestic schedule, the IPL and all the rest of it worked in the real world. Well, as the man said, good luck Rob. You’ll need it.",Sport/Sport,Rob Key aims to keep it simple as he attempts to revive England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/rob-key-aims-to-keep-it-simple-as-he-attempts-to-revive-england
4/29/2022,"Virtually every home in the UK is subjected to air pollution above World Health Organization guidelines, according to the most detailed map of dirty air to date. More than 97% of addresses exceed WHO limits for at least one of three key pollutants, while 70% of addresses breach WHO limits for all three. The map, produced by the non-profit group the Central Office of Public Interest (Copi) and Imperial College London, combined 20,000 measurements with computer modelling to produce pollution estimates every 20 metres across the country. People can check their address at the website addresspollution.org for free. The website also ranks each address against national pollution levels. For example, Buckingham Palace in London is in the 98th percentile, with highly polluted air, while Balmoral Castle in Scotland is in the zero percentile, with the cleanest air. The towns and cities with the highest proportion of homes in the top 10% most polluted nationally are Slough in Berkshire, with 90%, followed by London, with 66%. Others in the worst 10 include Portsmouth, Leeds, Manchester and Reading. Copi is calling for a legal requirement for air pollution data to be disclosed to home buyers and renters, as is already the case with asbestos, for example. “Air pollution affects all of us. With this new accurate data now publicly available, it would be shameful for the property industry to not start acting transparently – lives depend on it,” said Humphrey Milles, the founder of Copi, which promotes public awareness campaigns on issues it says are being neglected by government. The WHO sharply reduced its guideline limits for air pollution in September, to reflect the increasing scientific evidence of the harm to health caused by toxic air. A 2019 review concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ in the body, causing at least 7 million early deaths a year worldwide and about 40,000 in the UK. The WHO says air pollution is the biggest environmental threat to human health and is a public health emergency. The UK’s legal limit for nitrogen dioxide is four times higher than the new WHO limit, but is still not met in most urban areas. The country’s legal limit for tiny particles less than 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5) is five times higher than the WHO limit, while the UK limit for PM10 is 2.7 times higher. The air pollution campaigner Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said: “This new data shows yet again that the government is failing the British public. Now people can really see the filthy air they’re breathing at their home, school or work address. Everyone needs to know what they’re breathing, and now with this new public service they can.” Kissi-Debrah’s nine-year old daughter Ella died in 2013, and a landmark coroner’s ruling later cited air pollution as a cause of death. The coroner then issued an official “report to prevent future deaths” in April 2021, which said: “Greater awareness [of air pollution] would help individuals reduce their personal exposure to air pollution. Publicising this information is an issue that needs to be addressed by national as well as local government.” Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, a special adviser on air pollution to the Royal College of Physicians, said: “Air pollution is an invisible killer, and it’s easy for people to forget and ignore. It’s essential that the public are given air pollution data for where they are thinking of buying or renting. In many cases like that of little Ella, it can be a matter of life or death.” Rebecca Marsh, the UK’s property ombudsman, said: “Air pollution is information all consumers should be aware of before they make a decision on a specific property. Arguably, this is material information that all sellers or landlords should be providing.” The map shows annual average pollution levels for 2019, the last year that was unaffected by Covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions. Even using the previous higher WHO guidelines, 55% of UK addresses would still breach the limit for at least one of the three pollutants. Sean Beevers, a researcher at Imperial College, said: “It is not just a London problem, so people should be thinking about air pollution more. What had previously been seen as reasonable levels have now been thrown out the window.” Beevers said, however, that the models were not perfect and cautioned against seeing places with slightly higher estimates of air pollution as necessarily worse than nearby places with slightly lower pollution.",News/Environment,"Dirty air affects 97% of UK homes, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/dirty-air-affects-97-of-uk-homes-data-shows
4/29/2022,"A 77-year-old white South African farm owner has appeared in court after shooting and wounding a black woman he claimed he mistook for a hippopotamus. Paul Hendrik van Zyl, was arrested on Tuesday after “firing shots in the direction of the woman”, Ramokone Linah, who was fishing with her partner in a river in Lephalale town, northern Limpopo province. Van Zyl faces attempted murder charges, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). “The arrested suspect alleged that he was shooting at the animals” police spokesperson, Mamphaswa Seabi, said in a statement. Linah, 38, sustained gun shot wounds on her arm, while her partner “managed to hide” before informing police and emergency services, police said. The accused “is the owner of the farm where the incident occurred”, said Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, NPA spokesperson in the province. Police seized two rifles, one revolver, one pistol, and two airguns during the arrest. Deep racial divisions remain in South Africa 28 years after the end of white minority apartheid rule, and such incidents frequently cause outrage. According to one local media report, the victim was part of a group of local men and women who had been fishing in a river near Mamojela Park, an informal settlement outside the mining town of Lephalale, since mid-morning. The shooting occurred in the early afternoon. Witnesses said van Zyl had fired at the group from the other riverbank and had been heard to tell police that he had aimed at what he thought were “hippos and monkeys”. A group of opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters staged a protest about the granting of bail outside the court, according to the party’s posts on Twitter. Hendrik was freed on 1,000 rand ($62) bail and the case was postponed for further investigations to 18 May. In a country where firearms are common, fatal accidents occur often, with about 250 people killed in 2018. According to 2019-2020 police crime statistics, more than 7,000 murders with guns were reported in South Africa. In a similar incident five years ago, a South African farmer was accused of wounding a farm worker with a pellet gun after “mistaking him for a monkey”. The incident also took place in Limpopo province.",News/World news,White South African in court for shooting black woman he claims he ‘mistook for hippo’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/white-south-african-in-court-for-shooting-black-woman-on-his-farm
4/29/2022,"Sex crimes logged by police in England and Wales have reached a record high amid warnings from the victims’ commissioner that the government’s aim to boost prosecutions to levels last seen five years ago is “a pipe dream”. Police-recorded sexual offences increased to their highest level over a 12-month period, with 183,587 in the year to December 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figures, which include cases of rape, stalking, spiking and domestic abuse, represent a 22% increase on 2020 and 13% on 2019. About 37% of sexual offences recorded were rapes, which rose 21% from 55,592 in the year to December 2020. Vera Baird, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, said the increase in reported rapes contrasted with the low number of prosecutions and left the government with little hope of reaching its goal of returning to 2016-17 prosecution levels of 5,190 cases a year. They fell nearly 60% in four years to 2,102 in 2019-20 even as the number of reports to police increased. “Record levels of victims are coming forward, but the charging rate remains in the doldrums. The marked increase in victim reporting is simply not translating into increased referrals and charges,” Baird said. “Close to a year since the publication of the government’s end-to-end rape review, we are yet to see any substantive improvement. The government’s promise to return to 2016-17 levels of prosecutions by the end of this parliament remains a pipe dream.” The increase in reported sex crimes may reflect a number of factors, the ONS said, including the “impact of high-profile incidents, media coverage and campaigns on people’s willingness to report incidents to the police, as well as a potential increase in the number of victims.” The rape and murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021 prompted a national debate over women’s safety, sexual violence and the response of police and prosecutors. Police forces have launched campaigns to encourage victims to come forward. Home Office figures also show that the proportion of all offences resulting in a charge fell in a year from 7.5% to 5.8%, not much more than a third of the rate of 15.5% in 2014-15 when records began. Total police-recorded crime was lowest in the first quarter of the year (January-March 2021) when there were major Covid lockdowns, but from April recorded crime returned to the levels seen before the pandemic, the ONS report said. It added: “Since restrictions were lifted following the third national lockdown in early 2021, police-recorded crime data show indications that certain offence types are returning to or exceeding the levels seen before the pandemic. While violence and sexual offences recorded by the police have exceeded pre-pandemic levels, theft offences and robbery remain at a lower level despite increases over the last nine months.” Overall police-recorded violence increased by 13% in a year, from nearly 1.8m offences to more than 2m in the year ending December 2021. Diana Fawcett, the chief executive of the charity Victim Support, said: “We are seriously concerned that sexual offences have reached a record high for the second year in a row. Sadly, these figures reflect what we’re seeing – the number of sexual violence cases referred to us have increased by a third since before the pandemic.” A Home Office source said the government was committed to reducing murder, neighbourhood crimes such as robbery and serious violence through a “Beating the Crime” plan announced by Boris Johnson in October. “Official statistics out today demonstrate that the Beating the Crime plan is working, with neighbourhood crime down by 31% and hospital admissions for under-25s as a result of assaults with a knife or sharp object down by 19% since June 2019. But there is much more work to do to reduce the number of lives being lost, so the government will continue backing the police to be relentless in their pursuit of violent criminals.”",News/UK news,Recorded sex crimes reach record high in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/28/sex-crimes-record-high-england-wales-prosecution-levels
4/29/2022,"Boris Johnson is under increasing pressure to take immediate disciplinary action against the Conservative MP accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons. The chief whip issued a statement on Wednesday suggesting the matter should be referred to parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which deals with sexual harassment and other disciplinary matters. But senior Tories questioned why he had not taken action directly against the MP, whose alleged behaviour was witnessed by two female colleagues in recent months. The identity of the MP is known to party whips, it is understood, but sources denied suggestions the MP was himself a whip. One cabinet minister described the situation as “madness all round”, while Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, said: “I hope the chief withdraws the whip. In any other workplace they would be on gardening leave.” Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, was present at a meeting of the “2022 committee” – a group of Tory women – earlier this week, when a series of incidents, including the MP watching pornography, were described. On Thursday the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on Johnson to bypass the potentially lengthy ICGS process, and discipline the MP directly. “This is an unusual case because the Tory party knows who this individual is. I think that they should deal with it, and deal with it sooner rather than later … They know who this is. They should take action now,” he said. Misogyny and sexism in parliament have come under close scrutiny in recent days, after a widely criticised Mail on Sunday story claimed Tory MPs believed Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, crossed and uncrossed her legs to distract Johnson at prime minister’s questions. Asked whether the MP accused of watching pornography should lose the whip, the prime minister insisted on Thursday that the case should be investigated independently. It was “obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace” but “what needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts,” Johnson said. A spokesperson for the whips’ office said: “This is the best way of handling this, because they can look at everything fairly, independently. This is the best process that we could have in place to deal with this matter.” At least five cabinet ministers have expressed alarm privately or publicly about the reports. Earlier in the day, the attorney general, Suella Braverman, said some MPs behaved like “animals”, and talked about a “coarsening” of behaviour in parliament and elsewhere. “I think this is something that does happen in many, if not all, workplaces, where a small minority of men – and it is men – are behaving in an unacceptable way,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. “I think that’s actually a more worrying symptom of our society and our culture. How have we got to a place in our society where watching pornography on the tube, in public, in front of children, in parliament, in the workplace has become somehow normalised for some people?” Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, told the BBC: “I’ve been around a while and I think it’s actually getting worse [for female MPs] … I always thought that, get more women in … things will get better, but sadly I don’t see that happening at the moment. I think we just need to have a majority of women maybe. So it’s just disappointing.” Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: “There have been several instances of inappropriate and sexist behaviour recently in parliament. It is shameful. Parliamentarians are public servants and it is their duty to set an example of character and integrity. The culture of Westminster needs to change.”",News/Politics,Senior Tories pressure Johnson to act now on MP accused of watching porn,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/johnson-must-act-now-on-mp-accused-of-watching-porn-in-commons-starmer
4/29/2022,"Ukraine’s prosecutor general has named 10 Russian soldiers allegedly involved in human rights abuses during the month-long occupation of Bucha. Iryna Venediktova also told German TV that that Ukranian investigators had identified “more than 8,000 cases” of suspected war crimes since Russia’s invasion, which included accusations of “killing civilians, bombing of civilian infrastructure, torture” and “sexual crimes”. Her comments came as the international criminal court (ICC) ramps up its investigation into alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine since the start of the war. The Dutch government will “very soon” send a team of “several dozen” forensic specialists to Ukraine on behalf of the ICC to gather evidence of human rights abuses, the ANP press agency reported on Thursday. Russian forces’ retreat from Kyiv in early April left horrifying evidence of atrocities littered across the region’s suburbs and towns, where scores of bodies in civilian clothes were found lying in the streets or buried in shallow graves. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Venediktova identified 10 soldiers – two sergeants, four corporals and four privates – who she said were all “involved in the torture of peaceful people” during the brutal occupation of Bucha, a small commuter town 18.5 miles north-west of Kyiv. Venediktova said the soldiers were part of the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade, a unit based in the Khabarovsk region, on the Pacific coast in Russia’s far east. “During the occupation of Bucha, they took unarmed civilians hostage, killed them with hunger and thirst, and kept them on their knees with their hands tied and their eyes taped. [The hostages] were mocked and beaten with fists and the rifle stocks. They were beaten for information about the location of the [Ukrainian] armed forces … and some were tortured for no reason at all,” she wrote. Venediktova appealed to the public to help gather evidence, and said that Ukrainian prosecutors and police officers are now investigating whether any of the men were also involved in homicides. Ukraine, together with a number of western countries and human rights organisations, has accused Russian forces of summarily killing civilians in Bucha. Stanislav Kozynchuk, the deputy head of the prosecutor’s office for the Kyiv region, said that investigators are working with victims to identify the perpetrators of human rights abuses. “Our suspects are military personnel from the Russian Federation,” he said. “We understand who was there, what happened, and now we are looking into these military units which participated in the killings.” Some of the implicated soldiers have already been redeployed to fight in eastern Ukraine, he said. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch said that “Russian forces committed a litany of apparent war crimes during their occupation” of the town, adding that ​​investigators “found extensive evidence of summary executions, other unlawful killings, enforced disappearances and torture, all of which would constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity.” The Guardian has reported that dozens of civilians who died during the Russian occupation of Bucha were killed by tiny metal arrows from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s defence ministry identified Russia’s 64th Motor Rifle Brigade as the unit that had occupied Bucha, publishing the names, ranks and passport details of all the soldiers. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the alleged human rights abuses, while Russian state television has aired reports claiming that the images of dead civilians in Bucha were staged or the result of crimes committed by Ukrainian forces. During a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, in the Kremlin on Tuesday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that “Russian forces had no connections to Bucha.” “We know who did it. We know who prepared this provocation … We know who they are,” Putin added, without providing further details. Earlier this month, Putin awarded the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the honorary title of “guards” and praised the unit for its “great heroism and courage”. “This high distinction recognises your special merits, great heroism and courage in defending your Fatherland, and in protecting Russia’s sovereignty and national interests,” Putin’s statement said.",News/World news,Ukraine names 10 Russian soldiers in alleged human rights abuses in Bucha ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/ukraine-names-10-russian-soldiers-in-alleged-human-rights-abuses-in-bucha
4/29/2022,"Ministers have been accused of “bending the rules to dodge scrutiny” after Downing Street missed the deadline for publishing the security advice it received about granting Evgeny Lebedev a peerage. MPs voted last month for the material to be released after reports that MI5 raised security concerns when the Evening Standard owner and son of a KGB officer was nominated by Boris Johnson to join the House of Lords in March 2020. Labour used an opposition day in the Commons to table a “humble address” – a type of motion that forces the government to release documents that was rarely used until a few years ago. Conservative whips were initially expected to order their MPs to vote against the move, all but ensuring it would fail – but a sizeable number of rebels made clear they were not prepared to do so, forcing the government to allow abstentions. The deadline for publishing the advice about Lord Lebedev’s peerage was 28 April. But the Cabinet Office minister admitted after parliament was prorogued in preparation for the Queen’s speech that work retracting some bits of information had not been finished. Michael Ellis claimed redactions needed to be made “for the purposes of national security”, which he said was “a consideration which is of upmost importance given the government’s responsibility to protect information when disclosure is not in the public interest”. The minister said the government was also “giving considerations to other principles, such as the need to protect the data of private individuals, communications with Her Majesty and also to the conferring by the crown of any honour or dignity”. He confirmed all the security services’ advice “has now been collated” but said that “all necessary considerations” had not been completed and that he regretted missing the deadline. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, claimed that by failing to release the documents, the government was “once again bending the rules to dodge scrutiny”. She said: “This last-minute delay just kicks the can further down the road, and has all the hallmarks of a government with something to hide. “If the prime minister wasn’t involved in forcing through the appointment of an individual of concern to our intelligence services, why won’t he come clean and publish the guidance in full, as parliament voted for?” Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s former chief adviser, said last month that he was in the room when Cabinet Office officials told Johnson the intelligence services had “serious reservations about the PM’s plan”. Johnson has previously denied he intervened to secure a peerage, and Lebedev said that he was not an “agent of Russia”.",News/Media,Tories ‘bending the rules’ after missing deadline for publishing Lebedev advice,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/28/tories-missing-deadline-publishing-mi5-evgeny-lebedev-advice
