2/9/2022,"Simone Biles and Lindsey Vonn were among the US sports stars to throw their support behind Mikaela Shiffrin amid the American alpine skiing star’s nightmarish start to the Winter Games. Shiffrin, one of the most decorated skiers in history whose bid for as many as five medals in China has been a tentpole of US rightsholder NBC’s breathless promotion of the Olympics, has failed to complete either of her two races so far thanks to a pair of highly uncharacteristic errors.  The 26-year-old overall World Cup leader skied out after missing a gate early in her first run of Monday’s giant slalom, ending her Olympic title defence only 10 seconds into her Beijing debut. Then on Wednesday, Shiffrin nearly fell at the fourth gate and was disqualified before the sixth in the women’s slalom, her signature event. As the dejected two-time Olympic champion sat in the snow on the side of the hill with her head bowed in disbelief for more than 10 minutes. NBC drew criticism on social media for lingering on the shot while other skiers continued their first runs. While the network’s cameras were fixed on Shiffrin, the four-times Olympic champion gymnast Simone Biles tweeted a show of support. Shortly after, Biles retweeted a post by the LGBTQ+ activist Charlotte Clymer, who wrote: “I don’t know, shaming people just because they didn’t perform well at the Olympics feels like the opposite of why we supposedly have the Olympics in the first place.” Vonn, the famed American skier whose three Olympic medals include a downhill gold in 2010, wrote that she was “gutted” for her longtime US teammate. “But this does not take away from her storied career and what she can and will accomplish going forward,” Vonn tweeted. “Keep your head high.” In Biles’s case, the gesture was reciprocal. Eight months ago, when her own decision to withdraw from the Olympic women’s gymnastics team competition and most of the individual program due to mental-health issues registered shock waves through the sports world, Shiffrin was among the highest-profile athletes to rally behind Biles. Another call for empathy came from Shiffrin’s boyfriend, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, the Norwegian skier who bounced back from a disappointing finish in the men’s downhill to win a bronze medal in the men’s super-G on Wednesday. Kilde shared a photo of Shiffrin seated on the hill in anguish after Wednesday’s disqualification and asked his followers to reflect on what it represented. “When you look at this picture you can make up so many statements, meanings and thoughts,” he wrote. “Most of you probably look at it saying: “she has lost it”, “she can’t handle the pressure” or “what happened?”… Which makes me frustrated, because all I see is a top athlete doing what a top athlete does! It’s a part of the game and it happens. “The pressure we all put on individuals in the sports are enormous, so let’s give the same amount of support back … It’s all about the balance and we are just normal human beings!!” A tearful Shiffrin, suddenly bruised by self-doubt, opened up at the bottom of the hill on Wednesday about the weight of these Olympics. “My entire career has taught me to trust in my skiing if it’s good skiing and that’s all that I have to rely on … Of course the pressure is high, but that didn’t feel like the biggest issue today,” she said. “So it’s not the end of the world, and it’s so stupid to care this much, but I feel that I have to question a lot now.” That has been in step with her transparency over the past few months during a sometimes turbulent run-up to Beijing that included back spasms that limited her preparation in November, a bout with Covid-19 that sidelined her in December and the unknowns surrounding the Xiaohaituo Mountain staging the Alpine skiing programme, where the usual test events that allow skiers to get used to the hill were canceled due to the pandemic. She has also felt the absence of her father, Jeff, whose accidental death in February 2020 made her consider hanging up her skis entirely. “Right now, I would really like to call him, so that doesn’t make it easier,” Shiffrin said after Monday’s mishap. “And he would probably tell me to just get over it. But he’s not here to say that. So on top of everything else, I’m pretty angry at him, too.” For now, Shiffrin will look ahead to Friday’s super-G, the speed race which she has never entered in two previous Winter Games but did win at the 2019 world championships. She will also have medal chances in Tuesday’s downhill and on 17 February in the Alpine combined, where she took silver in 2018.

2/9/2022,"Nguy Thi Khanh, Vietnam’s first recipient of the prestigious Goldman environmental prize, has been arrested on tax evasion charges. The founder of the Green Innovation and Development Centre was detained last month, but her detention was confirmed by state media on Wednesday.  Khanh, who won the Goldman prize in 2018, has campaigned for Vietnam to adopt greener energy strategies, putting her at odds with the country’s ambitions to boost its coal production. Last month, her office and home were searched and documents and devices were confiscated. It is understood she has been allowed to speak with her lawyer, who was not immediately available for comment. Khanh is the latest activist to be detained by the authorities on tax-related charges. Last month, Dang Dinh Bach, who heads the Law and Policy of Sustainable Development Research Center, was sentenced to five years in prison for tax evasion, while the journalist Mai Phan Loi, leader of the Center for Media in Educating Community, received a four-year prison term for tax fraud. Both are board members of the VNGO-EVFTA network, a group of seven community organisations involved in monitoring how the implementation of the EU-Vietnam free trade agreement, which came into force in August 2020, impacts workers’ rights, land rights and environmental strategies. The organisations said the Vietnamese authorities had begun clamping down on their activities last year after they launched a campaign to promote clean energy. Phil Robertson, deputy director for Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said: “Now that Hanoi has finished imprisoning all the political dissidents while the world was distracted by Covid-19, the state’s repressive apparatus is turning on the environmental and social NGOs. “Let’s hope the world fights harder for civil society leaders than they did for the dissidents, many of whom are now serving long prison terms for simply speaking out against rights abuses and corruption.”",News/Global development,Award-winning Vietnamese environmentalist arrested as rights groups fear ‘clamp down’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/09/award-winning-vietnamese-environmentalist-arrested-as-rights-groups-fear-clamp-down
2/9/2022,"In 2007, Boris Johnson took a shot at Hillary Clinton, then a candidate for the Democratic US presidential nomination, in his Telegraph column. He wrote that Clinton’s eyes put him in mind of a “sadistic nurse in a mental hospital” and that she represented “everything I came into politics to oppose,” not least “purse-lipped political correctness”. He even threw in a reference to “the position of poor Vince Foster’s gun”. Foster was a Clinton-era White House counsel, and his suicide in 1993 has fed wild conspiracy theories – including that the Clintons had him murdered – ever since.  When Clinton ran for president again in 2016, her opponent Donald Trump often spoke of her in similarly inflammatory terms, referring to the Foster case as “very fishy”. Anti-Clinton propaganda swelled online to the point where, a month after the election, a man stormed into a Washington pizzeria to investigate claims that Clinton and other top Democrats were running a paedophile ring out of the basement. “Pizzagate”, as it was known, and the broader QAnon movement that believes a cabal of Satan-worshipping celebrity paedophiles control the world, has since drifted ever closer to the heart of American public life. This brings us back to Johnson, who last week lobbed a paedophilia-themed smear at his own political opponent when he falsely suggested in the Commons that Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, had personally failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile during his tenure as director of public prosecutions. Then, on Monday, a mob of protesters harassed Starmer as he walked near the Houses of Parliament, lobbing a range of conspiratorial grievances including that he was a “traitor” and “paedo protector”. It’s not clear whether the protesters were directly incited by Johnson’s words. But it’s abundantly clear that these sorts of conspiracy theories all swim together in the same cesspool and that it isn’t possible to draw a neat dividing line down the middle of the Atlantic. What happens in America – online and off – increasingly influences what happens here. The protesters who mobbed Starmer were marching in solidarity with a Canadian anti-mandate movement that has documented QAnon ties. More generally, QAnon, while still small in the UK, has been growing here, too. British adherents, along with other extremists, have previously circulated the Starmer/Savile smear online. This is the putrid context in which Johnson smeared Starmer. Johnson has always been a keen observer of American political trends, and so it would surprise me if he didn’t know about this one. As much as allies might try to defend it as normal parliamentary “cut and thrust”, Johnson’s remark was a distinctly Trumpian act – not only in its execution, but also in its reception in online fever swamps. Comparisons between Johnson and Trump are often overblown. Trump’s moves to rile his base have tended to be much more overt, representing a greater departure from conventional political discourse. And he has long stacked his inner circle with creatures of the far-right media fringe – such as Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn. Johnson, who is as pure a product of the London media establishment as you’re likely to meet, has tended to hire spinners with ties to mainstream tabloids. His new communications director, Guto Harri, is a former BBC journalist who wasn’t rightwing enough to hold down a job at GB News. And attacking opponents with anything that might stick, of course, is a longstanding British media tradition. As a columnist for the Telegraph, Johnson made a habit of smearing his political enemies with a wink and a nod, usually before retreating to a place of plausible deniability. He did just that with his Clinton column, claiming later that it was all a big joke. He played his Starmer line the same way, initially defending it, before “clarifying” that of course he wasn’t referring to anything Starmer did personally, but rather his overarching role as leader of the prosecution service at the time. It seems likely that Johnson wasn’t necessarily trying to set a parade of far-right ghouls on Starmer as much as he was desperately throwing out a distraction – any distraction – from the scandals engulfing his government; a classic Johnsonian “dead cat”. That strategy has always been nasty. But our present, US-infused information hellscape makes it dangerous, too. Government sources have told reporters that it’s unreasonable to see the mob’s actions as Johnson’s fault. But cesspools are hard to separate; when they’re stirred up, everything floats together. And, as we’ve learned from the Trump years, it doesn’t take many extremists to seize on a leader’s words for violence to ensue. Johnson condemned the mob that harassed Starmer, but he’s made it clear that he won’t be saying sorry for his Savile remark or further distancing himself from it. In 2016, when he was asked again about his old Clinton attacks, he replied that “there is such a rich thesaurus now of things that I have said” that “it would really take me too long to engage in a full, global itinerary of apology to all concerned”. He’s clearly not intending to set off on one now. Jon Allsop is a freelance journalist.

2/9/2022,"While fears of a possible Russian military invasion of Ukraine continue to grow in Europe and the west, people in Ukraine have to get on with their daily lives. A callout asking people about the situation in the country received scores of responses, with readers primarily emphasising that while there was concern, Ukrainians were not in a state of panic and life largely continues as normal. Many underlined that the crisis was not new – there has been a conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east since 2014.  The Guardian received submissions from people across Ukraine, with about half of responses coming from residents of the capital, Kyiv. Here, five people share their experiences of what it’s like living with the threat of a Russian invasion. Last week I went to the supermarket and stocked up on some basic food items. It’s one of the first things that comes to your mind – the kind of thing we did when the pandemic broke out. So I just went and bought stuff that has a long shelf life, like pasta, olive oil, canned food, rice. I haven’t seen anyone panic-buying in the supermarket. I also checked where my documents were and put them in a backpack together with my laptop. It’s really hard to imagine what this can be like. I’ve been fortunate to only have seen war in films. Basically I’m getting my inspiration from Hollywood films – it sounds a bit silly, but you don’t really know how to behave. There’s this general feeling of unease – can you even make long-term plans? I have started taking sleeping medication to help me sleep at nights when I suffer from bouts of anxiety. I am in central Ukraine. I’m kind of halfway between Kyiv and Crimea, so it’s still a long way from, for instance, Donetsk and Luhansk. It’s much worse in eastern Ukraine and in Kyiv. I have friends [there] and my brother also lives in Kyiv. They do say that people are panicking a lot more there because they feel they might be the primary target. I have a friend in Kyiv who says many of her friends have signed up for self-defence courses or even purchased hunting rifles. I live with my three-and-a-half-year-old daughter and retired parents. My daughter and I have European passports (my partner is French) but I can’t bear leaving my parents behind. If push comes to shove, I may simply have no choice as I need to protect my daughter. Julia, 34, Kropyvnytsky, translator Many people have already thought of what they will do in case of an invasion, like whether they will go with their relatives, whether they will go themselves, where they will [send] their relatives. I don’t want to run somewhere, I don’t want to leave Ukraine … I don’t want to have to [make] this decision. But [in case of an invasion], I think that I will join the army. At least as far as I’m able to do that, because I don’t have military experience. [Invasion] feels like it’s very, very possible. I cannot say what is more likely – that invasion will be or that it won’t be. Maybe the feeling is like 50/50, but 50 is a lot. It seems like everyone is nervous but not in panic. At least so far. All in all we are used to it – war and military threats from Russia have become a common business over the last eight years. The escalation has become the [main] topic in our media and a usual topic of chats over coffee. People discuss whether to fight, to do nothing or to run away somewhere in Europe. YouTube is full of [videos advising] “how to prepare for surviving a war” or “what to put in your survival/alarm kit”. These videos have mostly been created in the last two months – some were created [before] but have become popular now. Some people are making stocks of some supplies, like food, but in general I don’t feel like it’s too many people. The shops are full of products. Dmytro, 27, Kyiv, works at a law firm There was a little bit of panic a few weeks ago after the American embassy ordered their staff to go back home – because of this, the [value] of Ukrainian hryvnia went down compared with the euro or American dollar. But the exchange rate has got back to where it was. As the Ukrainian president said, we need to remember that the war started in 2014 when they [Russia] annexed Crimea. Just because Ukraine wasn’t in the centre of all the media outlets in the world, it doesn’t mean that there was no war – 14,000 have died as a result. So I suppose for my parents and for [other people], they don’t feel that this crisis is new. I have lived in the UK for eight years but have been in Odessa for the past three weeks visiting my parents. It was the first time I was able to visit them in two years because of Covid. Odessa is the centre of the navy in Ukraine, so there are navy ships around, and Nato ships come to Odessa when they visit the Black Sea. So from that perspective, I guess people feel a bit more protected. People are very much pro-Ukraine, they support independence, they support American and British help. You can even get a free drink in some parts of Odessa if you have a British passport. People talk about the Russian threat a lot, of course. However, no one is panicking. People go on with their lives. Shopping, work, school, banks are as busy as usual without any signs of despair and mistrust. The attitude [towards Russia] here is sort of like: come on, you can try, but nothing good will come out of it. Rodion, 37, visiting Odessa, works in the pharmaceutical industry in the UK I am Russian-Ukrainian, born in St Petersburg but living in Kyiv all my life, since 1950. I’ve felt some hostility in the past [toward Russians] but it was hidden. Now it’s flourishing and really hurts. It hurts to see that between people because although I understand the hostility between the government and officials, I don’t understand enmity between common people. This is not right. 2014 was the crucial year [when the situation worsened] – Russians were regarded as personae non gratae. Some said just go away, just go to Russia. My daughter from my first marriage lives in Moscow, and my wife’s relatives [are also in Russia]. We avoid communicating about the situation. We speak trifles. I don’t know what [my daughter] thinks about the situation. We’re anxious. I live with my wife and she’s not well. We have no place to hide. So we’re just waiting. I’m reading the news every day. We’re anxious about how it will develop. I don’t have a gun, I don’t know how to fight back. I’m Russian, but I support my [Ukrainian] government and support the help that we’ve been offered from the west. I’m on the side of Ukraine, although I’m Russian, down to my bones. But Ukraine is my real native country. Victor, 72, Kyiv, former scientist I look at the news every 30-40 minutes and it has a huge impact on my mental health … but I can’t stop and I can’t think of anything else. I am very scared for my family – my four-year-old daughter and husband. I want to live my life in my beloved country, Ukraine, in my beloved city, Odessa. Live in a European democratic society. I want to make plans for the future, have another child, travel the world. But now I can’t plan anything. Even a trip to visit relatives in another area on the weekends. Because I do not know what awaits me tomorrow. Everything is calm on the streets – you might even think that nothing is happening. People are just trying to live their lives. But there is a terrible tension. Everyone around is trying not to talk about a possible Russian attack. And even at home we try not to talk about it. Everyone just reads the news every day and then I see in the eyes of my friends, neighbours and family the degree of growing anxiety. Yesterday my husband said that if the situation becomes the worst situation, [she should go] with the baby outside the country, and [he would] stay to [fight]. Now we live like it’s the last day, we try to be happy and take time with our family and do our work. Because we don’t know what will be tomorrow.

2/9/2022,"One of Britain’s largest trade unions has invited the governor of the Bank of England to work as a care worker for a day to witness how people cope on low pay. The GMB, which represents about 500,000 full and part-time workers, said Andrew Bailey should see first hand the challenges of making ends meet for people struggling on below average earnings – many of them low-paid women working in the care sector – after the central bank governor called for wage restraint to limit the rise in inflation.  Bailey caused uproar last week when he suggested that workers should help curb inflation by refraining from making wage demands, on the same day the Bank of England announced the biggest fall in disposable income in three decades. The central bank forecast that inflation, which increased to 5.4% in December, was on course to hit 7% in April while its latest estimates found that earnings were increasing by 4% to 4.5%. Bailey said interest rates would need to rise further if wages increased in line with inflation, causing unemployment to rise and economic growth to slow. “I’m not saying don’t give your staff a pay rise, this is about the size of it frankly. Show restraint,” Bailey said after the central bank’s monetary policy committee, which he chairs, increased the base interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5%. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said workers were not causing Britain’s cost of living crisis and should not be asked to pay for it. “Why is it that every time there is a crisis, rich men ask ordinary people to pay for it?” she said. Bailey was paid £575,538, including pension, in his first year as the Bank’s governor from March 2020, more than 18 times the UK average for a full-time employee. In the letter, GMB general secretary, Gary Smith, said Bailey should spend a day shadowing low-paid care workers to judge for himself how rising energy and food bills were affecting people on low incomes. “You do not appear to have called for restraint in price setting, or dividend payments,” he said. Smith continued: “Andrew Bailey should spend a day shadowing the low-paid workers in the care sector upon whom ‘restraint’ has been imposed for too long. “These are the predominately women workers at the frontline of the pandemic, who are putting their own lives at risk to care for some of the most vulnerable members of society. “The majority of those workers earn pennies more than the national minimum wage. After working a shift, I would be interested to know whether those workers should show ‘restraint’ against the mounting cost of living crisis. “I hope that Mr Bailey will be prepared to explain his reasoning to the people his apparent policy would affect.”",News/Business, Bank of England boss urged to shadow care worker for a day amid low pay row,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/bank-of-england-boss-urged-to-shadow-care-worker-for-a-day-amid-low-pay-row
2/9/2022,"Inmates held in a women’s prison are making 1,000 calls a month to Samaritans amid record levels of self-harm, increased violence and low safety levels usually only seen in men’s facilities, a damning report has found. Nearly a third of women held at Foston Hall in Derbyshire, which holds 272 residents, told inspectors they felt unsafe, while the use of force in the prison has doubled over nearly three years and is the highest on the women’s prison’s estate.  The women’s prison and youth offender institute is the first to be given a score of “poor” – the lowest – for the safety of female prisoners, since HM Inspectorate of Prisons developed its current framework more than a decade ago. The findings, in an official report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, have prompted calls for the government to abandon plans to build more women’s prison places. Nearly three-quarters of female prisoners have committed non-violent offences. The Ministry of Justice disclosed last year it would be building 500 new prison places for women, as the planned recruitment of an extra 20,000 police officers is expected to cause a rise in the female prison population. Inspections of the prison took place in October and November and it became apparent that the prison has struggled with the Covid pandemic. Charlie Taylor, HM chief inspector of prisons, said the rating of “poor” for safety levels was a “rare and unexpected finding” in a women’s prison. “Neither the prison’s assessment of vulnerability, nor the support offered to newly arrived women were good enough. The unpredictability of the regime was contributing to tensions on the wings and, we suspected, increased violence, particularly against staff. “Violence was now very high. The use of force had doubled since the last inspection and was the highest in the women’s estate. There was now far more frequent use of the poor segregation unit,” he said. Recorded levels of self-harm were also the highest in the women’s estate and two prisoners had taken their own lives since the last official inspection in February 2019, he said. “As an indicator of the level of distress, women were making 1,000 calls a month to Samaritans. The prison had no strategy to reduce self-harm or improve the care for those in crisis,” Taylor said. The response to women in crisis was too reactive, uncaring and often punitive, Taylor observed. “This, taken with other safety metrics and observation, meant it was no surprise that in our survey nearly a third of women told us they felt unsafe,” he said. The report also found that the majority of women who harmed themselves did not have enough support or activity and faced daily frustration in getting the help they needed. “Messages left on the prison’s crisis hotline had not been checked for six weeks,” the report found. The conclusions have prompted condemnation from prison campaigners. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said: “Foston Hall prison is a dangerous and harmful place for women. Horrendous rates of self-harm, exacerbated by the impact of Covid and restricted regimes, punitive treatment and segregation for women in crisis. This is inhumane and unjust.” Emily Evison, women’s policy officer at the Prison Reform Trust, said: “Women’s prisons are expected to solve problems which are made worse by women being in custody. Nearly three-quarters (72%) of women entering prison to serve a sentence have committed a non-violent offence. Many women who offend suffer from drug and alcohol addictions and mental ill health. “Building more women’s prison places, as the government has committed to doing, is an irrational response.” The report was accompanied by a paper identifying key findings in the inspection of five women’s prisons – Low Newton, Styal, Send, Downview and Foston Hall – in the last six months. Inspectors raised serious concerns about high rates of self-harm and vulnerability across the women’s prison estate, which accounts for only about 4% of prisoners in England and Wales. Self-harm is much more common for women in prison than men and has increased during the Covid-19 pandemic to record levels. Fifty-two per cent of women said they had children under 18 years old.

2/9/2022,"The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will meet her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Moscow on Thursday, although her plan to have passed the UK’s “toughest sanctions regime against Russia” in time for the trip appears to be in doubt. Truss told MPs the laws would be in place by 10 February, but nothing has been put to parliament, raising suspicions among opposition MPs that government lawyers are struggling to frame the sweeping and unprecedented new laws.  Without the sanctions laws, which the government said would be ready to use if Russia invaded Ukraine, Truss’s trip will lack a key piece of leverage. Truss will be in Moscow while the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will on Thursday be in Poland, one of the UK’s closest allies in Europe, before travelling to Brussels to meet the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. The legislation announced by Truss would “target any company that is linked to the Russian state, engages in business of economic significance to the Russian state, or operates in a sector of strategic significance to the Russian state”. The laws would also empower the UK Treasury to impose sanctions on individuals involved with these companies. Previously the UK had only been able to impose sanctions on businesses or individuals responsible for destabilising Ukraine. Truss told MPs on 31 January: “The package that we are putting forward in legislation will be in place by 10 February, which means that we are able to enact wide-ranging sanctions in broad categories that really target anybody who is providing strategic or economic support to the Russian regime. There will be nowhere to hide, and I am very clear that we will apply those sanctions without fear or favour.” She said the legislation, once on the statute book, would come into force as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine, were it to do so. Johnson said the sanctions would kick in as soon as a Russian “toecap” crossed the border. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said, “I do not know where the promised legislation is.” He also urged the government to introduce its repeatedly delayed economic crime bill as a matter of national security. He said: “So much of the wealth associated with the people close to the Putin regime is tied up in property in the UK. There is a very well-developed group of law firms, consultancies, trusts, PR firms who are ready to help these people and issue lawsuits against people who might expose them.” Speaking ahead of her visit to Moscow, Truss said: “Russia should be in no doubt about the strength of our response. We have said many times that any further invasion would incur severe costs, including through a coordinated package of sanctions. Russia has a choice here. We strongly encourage them to engage, de-escalate and choose the path of diplomacy.” The Foreign Office release made no mention of any date for putting the sanctions on the statute book. The Guardian has contacted the Foreign Office for comment. Major changes to UK sanctions legislation normally requires parliamentary approval. The visit is the first by a UK foreign secretary in more than four years. The Foreign Office said Truss would push for Russia to abide by the international agreements it has already signed up to – including the OSCE Helsinki Final Act, Minsk protocols, and the Budapest memorandum, which ensures the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine is respected. The Foreign Office has said the UK is spearheading international efforts to prevent an invasion. The country has been at the forefront of efforts to supply Ukraine with arms. However, the UK’s influence is restricted since it is not a member of the Normandy ormat, the four-member group of Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine that is supposed to oversee the Mink agreements on the future of the Russian-backed eastern region of Ukraine.",News/Politics,Liz Truss heads to Moscow with ‘toughest sanctions’ plan in doubt,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/liz-truss-moscow-toughest-russia-sanctions-plan-doubt
2/9/2022,"John Menzies, a Scottish firm that provides ground, air cargo and fuelling services at airports, has rejected a £469m takeover approach from a Kuwait rival, sending its shares soaring. The Edinburgh-based firm said its board had unanimously rebuffed a “preliminary and unsolicited proposal” from National Aviation Services, a subsidiary of the Kuwait-based Agility Public Warehousing, at a price of 510p a share in cash. It came after Menzies knocked back an earlier offer at 460p a share.  Shares in Menzies jumped 41% to 475p, a two-year high, and traded 32% higher by mid-morning at 443p, below the offer price. It is the latest overseas bid attempt after a surge in takeovers of UK companies by foreign firms in recent months, including the £7bn sale of Morrisons, Britain’s fourth-biggest supermarket group, to a US private equity firm. Menzies was founded in 1833 as a bookseller, but has focused on its aviation business since selling its newspaper distribution arm to the private equity firm Endless in 2018, after pressure from investors. It is one of the world’s biggest aviation services providers, with services including plane fuelling and de-icing, ground and cargo handling, and maintenance at more than 200 airports in 37 countries. Agility builds warehouse parks and offers last-mile delivery, as well as customs services, property management and aviation services across the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia. The company generates annual revenues of $5.4bn (£4bn). It was established as a state-owned company in 1979 and privatised in 1997, when Tarek Sultan, a Kuwait businessman and member of the country’s powerful Sultan family, was named chairman and managing director. After consulting its financial advisers, Goldman Sachs, Menzies concluded that “the proposal is entirely opportunistic, conditional and that the terms fundamentally undervalue Menzies and its future prospects”. It said the offer came “at a time when the full impact of management actions is not yet reflected in Menzies valuation and underlying volumes have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels”.

2/9/2022,"Newcastle city council’s leader, Nick Forbes, a close ally of Labour leader Keir Starmer who sits in the shadow cabinet, has been deselected from standing in May’s local elections, putting his political future in jeopardy. Forbes has run the city’s council for more than a decade, and also sits on Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) – but will be unable to remain in his post if he cannot stand for re-election.  At a selection meeting for his Arthur’s Hill ward on Tuesday evening, Forbes was defeated by Abdul Samad, a local activist, by 13 votes to four. Samad had previously stood for the Parklands ward in Newcastle, promising at the time to be a councillor who “put people first”. Forbes’s allies have described his defeat as being inflicted by the “hard left” and pointed out that the ward selection meeting was held late, limiting his opportunities to find an alternative potential seat. But two senior Labour sources suggested his defeat had also resulted from a power-struggle with Labour’s former chief whip Nick Brown. A Labour source said Brown had organised efforts to challenge Forbes as leader of the council after a falling out, and that Forbes had known his seat was under potential threat. “It’s obviously damaging and embarrassing. Nick is very accomplished but he did not organise well.” Brown, the MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East since 1983, was moved out of his longstanding role of opposition chief whip during Starmer’s reshuffle in May 2021. Forbes will be able to continue in his role on the NEC until September, even if he is not able to find a new area to stand in. The 48-year-old has been a prominent Labour voice in local government, leading the party’s representation on the Local Government Association. In a statement, Forbes said he was “immensely sad that Labour party members have chosen a different candidate” to stand for the ward he had represented for 22 years. He suggested he could try to find an alternative seat, saying: “A number of party members have already approached me asking if I will stand in a different ward.” Forbes said he would now “take some time to consider these options”. Of Newcastle’s 78 council seats, 26 are up for grabs in May. Labour is hoping to make significant advances in May’s local elections, exploiting Conservative disarray over the “partygate” allegations and Boris Johnson’s troubled leadership. Last year’s local elections were overshadowed by Labour losing the Hartlepool byelection, but Starmer’s team will hope their stronger showing in recent opinion polls will translate into a convincing performance.",News/Politics,Labour’s Newcastle city council leader deselected ahead of local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/labour-newcastle-city-council-leader-nick-forbes-deselected-ahead-of-local-elections

2/9/2022,"Police have been urged to investigate another party in Downing Street after a new photograph apparently showed Boris Johnson at a Christmas quiz in December 2020, with an open bottle of champagne and staff wearing Santa hats and tinsel. The image published by the Daily Mirror shows the prime minister with three members of staff at the event on 15 December, which No 10 has said was a virtual quiz.  EXCL: New bombshell image shows Boris Johnson with open bottle of bubbly at No 10 Christmas quiz https://t.co/2eK8mNvjdu Asked at prime minister’s questions if the Met police should add this to the events they are investigating, Johnson said the allegation was “completely in error”. At the time the photo was taken, London was under tier 2 restrictions, which banned social mixing between households. The government had explicitly told people they must not meet for Christmas parties. Johnson was challenged about the image at prime minister’s questions by the Labour MP Fabian Hamilton, who said: “It looks a lot like one of the Christmas parties he told us never happened.” Citing the case of a constituent who was unable to have family visit her in hospital when she was being treated for a tumour, Hamilton asked if Johnson would refer the event to police for investigation. Johnson replied by expressing his sympathy for the constituent, saying: “I understand very much her feelings. But in what he has said just, I am afraid, he is completely in error.” Asked again at PMQs about the photo, Johnson replied: “That’s precisely the point. That event already has been submitted for investigation.” The Met police are examining potential law-breaking at 12 gatherings in Downing Street, three of which Boris Johnson is known to have attended. A fourth event, in his Downing Street flat, is also under investigation and the prime minister has declined to say whether he was in attendance. But the event on 15 December, which was a virtual quiz for staff, was not among those gatherings referred to the Met police and Johnson insinuated they had already seen the evidence before making the decision. The police said they had been handed more than 300 photographs of events in Downing Street and 500 pages of evidence. A full report from the Cabinet Office official Sue Gray, who was asked to investigate the rule-breaking, is also expected to be released once the police work is concluded. The former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, now a fierce critic of Johnson, said further pictures would soon come out. “There’s waaaaay better pics than that floating around, incl[uding] in the flat,” he tweeted. “The pics will come out and the public will think ‘Met [police] lying’, not ‘oh PM innocent after all’. Penny dropping with MPs.” The new picture came to light just hours after sources suggested Johnson did not intend to resign if he was given a fixed penalty notice by police, though MPs could trigger a vote of no confidence. Mark Spencer, the former chief whip who has been moved to be leader of the House of Commons, told the BBC on Wednesday that most people had “had a drink” during lockdown. “I think clearly people were having a drink,” Spencer told BBC Radio Nottingham. “I’ve done that. I’ve had a drink of alcohol during Covid. “I think in the middle of an investigation it’s really difficult to get your story and your defence across because you’re not allowed to, because the police are investigating it. Once they’ve done that, once the facts are known, I think we’ll be in a much better place to talk this through. “The prime minister apologised at the dispatch box. It’s fair to say that Downing Street didn’t get everything right but let’s focus on the real world here. People are worried about their jobs, people are worried about the NHS.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson pictured at Christmas quiz with champagne and tinsel,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/boris-johnson-pictured-with-champagne-and-no-10-staff-at-christmas-quiz
2/9/2022,"Container ship accidents at sea should be considered the “oil spills of our time”, warned environmental organisations that found a toxic mix of metals, carcinogenic and other harmful chemicals on plastic washed up on Sri Lanka’s beaches after a cargo ship fire. When the X-Press Pearl sank off nine nautical miles off Colombo, Sri Lanka’s capital, in May 2021, the most “significant harm” from the country’s worst maritime disaster initially came from the spillage of 1,680 tonnes of plastic pellets, or “nurdles”, into the Indian Ocean. They were found in dead dolphins, fish and on beaches – in some places 2 metres deep. A UN report called it the “single largest plastic spill” in history.  But a new study, from Sri Lanka’s Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) and the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a coalition of NGOs in 124 countries, said the nurdle spill was the “tip of the iceberg” of environmental harm from the accident. Researchers analysed samples of nurdles and burnt lumps of plastic from four Sri Lankan beaches for heavy metals and various chemicals, including benzotriazole UV-stabilisers, which are used to prevent discoloration in plastics, bisphenols and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They found heavy metals as well as chemicals that both cause cancer and are “endocrine-disrupting”, or interfering with hormones. Of particular concern, they said, were levels of PAHs found on the burnt lumps, which far exceeded safe limits for consumer products set by the EU. For some substances, no level of exposure is considered safe. Dr Therese Karlsson, a science adviser at IPEN and co-author of the study, said: “Until now, there hasn’t been any publicly available chemical analysis of the spill. The chemicals have largely been overlooked because they are not visible.” While the nurdle spillage was “catastrophic”, Karlsson said, it was “the tip of the iceberg” due to the chemicals present – in particular BPA, which is used to make plastic and epoxy resins. “We found bisphenol-A (BPA), which is a probable human carcinogen and has been linked to everything from depression, to respiratory disease, to breast and colon cancer,” she said. “It is also an endocrine disruptor.” Of 1,486 containers carried on the vessel, 80 were classed as “dangerous goods” including caustic soda and nitric acid. The ship also carried epoxy resins, used in paints and primers, ethanol, and lead ingots, used to make vehicle batteries. The study concluded that current legislation and practices are insufficient to mitigate the risk of poorly packaged chemicals on ships. “Shipping is increasing, with 90% of the world’s trade moved by sea,” said Karlsson. “The cargo of these ships is so much more complex today. But the regulations have not kept up.” Chalani Rubesinghe, of CEJ, said the disaster had exposed the complexity of shipping chemicals. “These accidents have huge consequences on the environment and economies,” she said. The safety commission of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been discussing how to track containers and address the loss of pellets at sea. Sri Lanka has asked the IMO to classify plastic pellets as toxic substances, and Vanuatu is calling for better reporting of containers lost at sea. The Sri Lankan authorities said this week that clearing the wreck and debris of the sunken ship would take four months. They have filed an interim claim for damages of $40m (£30m) with the operator of the X-Press Pearl.",News/Environment,Cargo ship disasters are ‘oil spills of our time’ because of health risk from plastic,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/cargo-ship-disasters-are-oil-spills-of-our-time-because-of-health-risk-from-plastic
2/9/2022,"The family of a British author who was found dead close to her home in the Dominican Republic are hoping that a long-awaited trial will finally bring them answers. The body of Lindsay de Feliz, 64, was found in a shallow grave in the north-west of the country more than two years ago.  Her husband of 14 years, Danilo Feliz Torres, his two sons and a fourth man are to stand trial accused of her murder. All have pleaded not guilty. Proceedings are set to begin on 16 February after many delays. Speaking publicly for the first time, de Feliz’s family told the Guardian it would be a key moment in their search for justice. “Once the trial is over we will be able to start to grieve for Lindsay,” said her 60-year-old brother Patrick Firth. Her family in the UK – her mother, Shirley Firth, who is a few months away from her ninetieth birthday, and her three siblings – are grief-stricken by her death. Her mother misses their nightly conversations on Skype “where we put the world to rights”. De Feliz led a successful life in the UK, working as a marketing manager for various firms in the City. She longed for something different and in 2002 decided to leave her husband, job and life in the UK to follow her passion for scuba diving. After spending some time in the Maldives she settled in the Dominican Republic where she worked as a scuba-diving instructor and married a local man in 2005. Her family said she supported him financially to help him train as a lawyer and in an unsuccessful campaign to be elected as mayor. After she was shot in the throat during a robbery in 2006, de Feliz could no longer work as a diving instructor. She began writing blogs about her life in the Dominican Republic and published two memoirs – What About Your Saucepans? and Life After My Saucepans. The titles were references to a comment by her mother who had bought her a set of saucepans for Christmas that de Feliz did not take with her to the Dominican Republic. Her first book reached number one in the Amazon Kindle travel books chart. She adored her adopted country and the Dominican people. According to her mother, de Feliz would leave the UK after visits home for Christmas with suitcases bulging with over-the-counter medicines such as aspirin and paracetamol and plasters that she distributed to people living in poverty who were unable to access these basics. Her family say de Feliz was highly regarded in her adopted home and after her death there were 92 pages of tributes to her on the expat website DR1. “She was an amazing person,” Shirley Firth said. “She could go into a room and start talking to anyone. She made some dramatic changes in her life and even after she was shot in 2006 and could no longer work as a scuba-diving instructor she took it all in her stride. “A foundation has been set up in her memory to help disadvantaged women and children in the Dominican Republic. Royalties from her books are still coming in and we would like to give that money to a cause that Lindsay cared about.” Firth smiled at the memory of her daughter’s love of parsnips, which she tried and failed to grow in the Dominican Republic. She said that sometimes friends visiting from the UK would try to smuggle parsnips through customs for her. “We just have to keep going. We can’t have closure until this whole thing is finished,” she said. “We hope for some resolution and to see justice done.”",News/UK news,Briton’s family hope for answers in Dominican Republic murder trial,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/family-of-briton-lindsay-de-feliz-hope-for-answers-in-dominican-republic-trial
2/9/2022,"Ask trespassers if they are lost, install gates rather than stiles and only shoot dogs as a last resort. These are some of the guidelines issued to farmers and land managers by the government conservation agency Natural England, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales. The advice is designed to help people enjoy the countryside and covers protecting livestock and keeping rights of way usable.  The guidance includes advice on what to do if a dog is chasing farm animals, including a warning that farmers should only shoot a dog worrying livestock as a last resort. Recommendations for cutting back vegetation and keeping public waterways clear as part of ensuring rights of way are usable, putting in more accessible gates – or even leaving gaps – rather than stiles, and better signage for visitors, are also included in the guidance. It advises land managers who find walkers trespassing on their land that “visitors rarely mean to trespass” and to ask them if they are lost and help them get back to paths or areas they are allowed on. Land managers are encouraged to help visitors behave responsibly, securing gates open if they want people to leave that way, considering self-closing gates or signs if they want them shut, and keeping land free from rubbish that could encourage fly-tipping. It also includes advice on reporting criminal or threatening behaviour to the police, and reporting noise disturbances and fly-tipping to the local authority. There is advice on creating a safe environment, including stacking bales safely, using and storing chemicals responsibly, managing trees, and warning visitors of hazards in the landscape. The new guidance is issued under the Countryside Code, which was refreshed last year in an effort to help people of all ages and backgrounds enjoy the countryside responsibly – with tips such as advising people to say hello to others, stay on footpaths, and bag and bin their dog’s poo. The Natural England chief executive, Marian Spain, said: “With more people than ever before spending time in nature, this refreshed advice for land managers has never been more important in helping to ensure we work together to protect our outdoor spaces. “I urge all land managers to follow this new advice and continue to help make nature accessible to everyone, so people of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy the invaluable health and wellbeing benefits that nature offers, while giving it the respect it deserves.” The rural affairs minister, Richard Benyon, said: “We want to ensure that nature is accessible for all, whilst also supporting people to do the right thing when they are visiting the countryside. “The new advice in the Countryside Code will help farmers and land managers to help the public enjoy the outdoors in a responsible way. I am grateful to all of those stakeholders who have helped shape this updated guidance.”",News/UK news,‘Help lost trespassers’: Natural England issues new guidelines for farmers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/help-lost-trespassers-natural-england-issues-new-guidelines-for-farmers

2/9/2022,"Last week, a commission set up by Stanford University and the Lancet found that the devastating opioid crisis in North America could happen again, and not just there. The unethical practices that Patrick Radden Keefe documented in his prize-winning 2021 book, Empire of Pain, were not restricted to one company, Purdue Pharma, and the part of the Sackler family that owned it. They were and remain normal behaviour in the pharmaceutical industry and in the agencies that are supposed to regulate it. The Covid pandemic has, in some senses, been big pharma’s redemption. The vaccines that were developed at record speed, albeit on the back of decades of painstaking, publicly funded research, have been portrayed as a miracle of public-private cooperation. But this report reminds us that the question of trust isn’t going away – and it won’t until we do something about it.  At a Lancet webinar last week, the addiction expert at Stanford, Keith Humphreys, who led the commission, noted that if you measure the opioid crisis in terms of years of life lost, rather than absolute numbers of deaths, the fallout in the US and Canada has been on a par with that of Covid. Measure it by deaths relative to the populations of those countries, and it’s worse than the HIV/Aids epidemic at its North American peak. This “epidemic” was caused not by a virus, but by human greed. And it’s not over. Because those who became addicted to prescription painkillers often progressed to heroin and then fentanyl, the crisis is still growing despite tighter controls on prescription. The commission’s modelling suggests that without major policy changes, the US alone could lose another million lives before this decade is out. That’s not to mention the damage that addiction does even when it doesn’t end in death. What’s more, the crisis is spreading as companies cast their marketing nets wider – notably, to low- and middle-income countries where appropriate pain relief and palliative care are often in short supply. Rich countries aren’t immune either. GP prescriptions for opioids more than doubled in the UK between 1998 and 2018, prompting some to claim that the country was seeing its own opioid epidemic. Humphreys, who led the commission, laid the blame at the door of the opioid manufacturers, of which Purdue was only one. But he also described the culture that enabled them, pointing to “dramatic failures in regulation, in law, by healthcare systems and by individual physicians that failed to stop them”. And most of those weaknesses, he said, have not been fixed. They include a “revolving door” between industry and the agencies that regulate them; drug companies’ relative freedoms in countries to aggressively market their products; the existence of fake grassroots or “astroturf” groups that claim to represent patients’ interests but are actually in companies’ pay; and the industry’s well-funded lobbying of elected officials. Although the regulatory environments are different in Europe and the US, we know from at least 20 years of whistleblowing and investigative journalism that the problems the commission identified exist across the industry. In 2012, for example, GlaxoSmithKline was fined $3bn for promoting the inappropriate prescription of antidepressants to children. And last year, the French drugmaker Laboratoires Servier and the French medicines agency were fined for their part in the scandal over Mediator, a diabetes treatment that has been linked to hundreds of deaths. These cases will be familiar to those who follow drug industry shenanigans. What is interesting is the timing of the Stanford-Lancet report. It was released while we’re still living through a pandemic that has revealed unexpectedly high levels of mistrust in science. People who are vaccine hesitant often point to what they perceive to be the pharmaceutical industry’s untrustworthiness. Yet mainstream opinion absolves the industry of any responsibility for that. For the vaccine-compliant, the only bogeymen in this story – besides a handful of cynical anti-vaxxers – are the social media platforms that peddle disinformation. A week ago, for instance, the international non-profit NGO, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, wrote, “The simple fact is that the anti-vaxx movement – and its myriad offshoots – have gained public attention and traction for one main reason: because big tech profits from their content and their followers, and so refuses to take them down.” Let me be clear: the Covid vaccines deserve our trust. More than 10bn doses have been administered to date, and they have turned out to be safer and more effective than anyone dreamed possible. They are our best way out of this pandemic, and the more people who take them, the more lives will be saved. It is also worth pointing out that, even if Covid has created some vaccine billionnaires, vaccine development is not generally lucrative. Until Covid, big pharma was deserting the field because the profit margins were so slight – with the result that we still lack vaccines for some major killers, including HIV. But even if the industry pulled off a coup this time, in collaboration with academia, it needs to get its house in order or we risk seeing even higher levels of vaccine hesitancy in the next pandemic. After all, many people put their trust in opioids, and that didn’t work out so well. Some companies developing Covid vaccines, such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, have been censured for bad practices in the past. Is it really surprising that surveys show it is the least trusted industry? It is true social media has done us a disservice and our social contract was fraying before Covid came along. But it’s also true that, if anti-vaxxers and their enablers are ready to stop at nothing in pursuit of fat profits, they have an excellent role model in big pharma. If governments, industry and physicians acknowledge this needs to change, at long last, then this crisis won’t have gone to waste.

2/9/2022,"Single mothers have a hard time of it, in life and in fiction. Frequently they’re portrayed as unhinged psychos, sex-crazed hoydens, self-sacrificing saints (often widowed), or ground-down sloggers. I can’t think of that many happy, successful, yet devoted SMs in books – but maybe that wouldn’t make a good story. My second novel, Em & Me, centres on a single mother called Delphine, whose life was derailed as a teenager when she fell pregnant with her daughter Emily. I’ve long been preoccupied by the state of single motherhood, possibly since I had my own children and realised what back-breaking effort is required to raise them. The idea of doing it alone seems unimaginable, so I wanted to imagine it; to write a story that reflected the struggle but also allowed my protagonist to fulfil her ambition and potential.  Along the way, I’ve been inspired by these lone mothers of literature, in all their crazy, complex glory: 1. Medea by EuripidesIt might seem odd to start with a drama about a barbarian witch who kills her own children when her husband leaves her for a princess. But shoutout to Euripides for featuring a female protagonist who dominates the action, a chorus of Corinthian women, and a scot-free exit. Medea murders her sons in cold blood to annoy her ex, Jason. But Jason is maddening – a shameless social climber who rubs salt in the wound by suggesting Medea stay on as a mere mistress. Medea has the last laugh, escaping with the bodies of their sons in Helios’ chariot, hinting the Gods are on her side. This is a woman scorned taking back control and getting away with it. The Athenian audience didn’t react favourably to the notion, awarding the play third place (out of three) at the Dionysia festival of 431 BCE. I’m sure Euripides would be heartened to know Medea’s No 1 in my top 10. 2. Mrs Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility by Jane AustenI always think of Mrs Dashwood as ancient, but at 40 she’s four years younger than me. Perhaps it’s because she’s in the SM category of noble widow that she seems older. She has no name, known only as “Mrs Henry Dashwood”, subsumed into the persona of her dead husband, who failed to provide for her or his daughters. Like many of Austen’s mothers, her chief aim in life is to find suitable matches for her girls, who keep spraining their ankles, contracting fevers or being self-destructively repressed. It’s a sad trial for Mrs Dashwood, but she gets there in the end, and can happily retire to the bland Barton Cottage to await grandchildren. 3. Marmee in Little Women by Louisa May AlcottMrs March is the archetypal single mother saint. Technically she’s not single, but her husband’s absence elevates her to the SM sisterhood. Margaret March Senior is infuriatingly perfect. As a child, I remember being very upset at the thought of only getting a Bible for Christmas, and blamed Marmee, feeling she could have spent their pennies in a more enjoyable way, rather than virtue signalling. Alcott hints at dark depths when Marmee confesses she was once as hot-headed as her daughter Jo, but learned to control her temper. I would love to have seen a tiny flare of it, the glimmer of original sin. 4. The Bolter in The Pursuit of Love by Nancy MitfordAnother with no name, the Bolter is a favourite of mine, because she’s all sin – unrepentantly feckless, without a speck of maternal instinct, “too beautiful and too gay to be burdened with a child”. I find her extraordinary flippancy radical, inspiring and chilling. The family turn her hedonism “into a sort of joke” to avoid hurting daughter Fanny’s feelings, and that’s Mitford to a T – just because it’s funny doesn’t mean it’s not serious. 5. Annie Lee in Cider With Rosie by Laurie LeeMother Lee is noble and self-sacrificing but not as irritatingly good as Marmee. She’s messier and more endearing. “Disordered, hysterical, loving … muddled and mischievous”, Annie talks too much and dawdles, can’t cook or make beds, but her mothering skills are rich and varied. And, like many SMs, she stays when the father is long gone. In this tender, evocative coming-of-age, it’s not Rosie but Annie who wins my heart. 6. Pauline Mole in The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13¾ by Sue TownsendAdrian’s world is densely packed with detail and full of warmth despite the failings of his family. His mother Pauline is a philanderess who uses the family allowance to buy gin and cigarettes, locks the dog in the coal shed, sings My Way at 2am at the top of the stairs and runs off to Sheffield with another man. Ruthlessly unsentimental unless she’s drunk, on the rare occasions she reveals her maternal streak, it’s very special. When she turns up at Adrian’s bedside before he has his tonsils out, he dispassionately notes how old and haggard she looks. The love is there; it’s just locked in the coal shed with the dog, only let out occasionally. 7. Fiona Brewer in About a Boy by Nick HornbyHornby’s skill is making this chronically depressed and tiresomely earnest woman engaging and sympathetic. What Fiona does at the beginning of the book is startlingly selfish on one level, but also a painful reflection of the pressures of single motherhood, and the bone-crushing flatness of depression. Fiona is ground down by it all – being a mum isn’t enough, mothering alone isn’t enough, and that’s the trouble. 8. Jess Thomas in The One Plus One by JoJo MoyesA heart-tugging example of the long-suffering slogger, Jess juggles two jobs in an attempt to keep things together for her kids, occasionally Skyping Marty, their father, to suggest he contribute to their upkeep. When it’s later revealed exactly what Marty’s been up to since he left the family home, I relished Jess’s demented rage. In the end, Jess gets a worthy plus-one, just as she deserves. 9. Mia Warren in Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste NgMia’s guarded quality makes her fascinating, both to the reader and her landlady Mrs Richardson. Mia is Pearl’s mother, a listener and a watcher, intuitive and empathetic, but also distant. Elena Richardson’s rebellious daughter Izzy recognises Mia’s subversive spark and reacts to her subtly provocative challenge – “what are you going to do about it?” – ultimately resulting in a conflagration. An enigmatic figure, Mia’s magnetism puts her right at the heart of the fire, even if she’s not there to see it. 10. Desiree Vignes in The Vanishing Half by Brit BennettThe tale of light-skinned Black twins who take very different paths forces you to look one way, then the other, confounding expectations. Shy, introverted Stella boldly passes herself off as white. Desiree, the headstrong extrovert, returns to their dull home town with her daughter to escape an abusive relationship. But it’s Desiree who has the dignity that Stella craves and fails to find in her desperate sham of a marriage. Yin and yang, when Stella vanishes, Desiree stays – because that’s what single mothers have to do. They stick around. Em & Me by Beth Morrey is published by HarperCollins.
