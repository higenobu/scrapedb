5/13/2022,"Rishi Sunak has claimed he was prevented from raising benefits more at the spring statement because of the old computer system used by the Department for Work and Pensions. Acknowledging that technical problems “sounds like an excuse”, the chancellor told Bloomberg that he had discussed a higher rise than the 3.1% given across the board but was told there could be an uplift only once a year for people on some benefits. He highlighted the increase in the “national living wage”, the changes to the universal credit taper rate and discretionary support from councils as measures the government has done to help the lowest paid. But the claim of computer problems was labelled “pathetic” by Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, while Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, said the chancellor was “insulting your intelligence”. Many experts believe raising benefits would be the quickest and most effective way of helping the lowest-paid with the squeeze on living standards caused by inflation. The government has come under fire for raising benefits by just 3% when inflation is running at 7% and is forecast to hit 10% by the end of the year. “The operation of our welfare system is technically complicated,” Sunak said. “It is not necessarily possible to [increase benefits] for everybody. Many of the systems are built so it can only be done once a year, and the decision was taken quite a while ago.” He acknowledged that blaming the technology “sounds like an excuse” but insisted he was “constrained somewhat by the operation of the welfare system”. Ashworth highlighted the speed with which ministers acted to take away the £20 uplift in universal credit given to people during the pandemic – the biggest single cut to social security ever. “Shame Sunak’s computer didn’t say no to that,” he added. It was reported last month that Sunak had considered raising benefits by more than 3.1%, but that the Treasury was told “you could only do it once a year and this was not the time of year that you could do it”. The problem was said to be the antiquated IT system that distributes some legacy benefits such as jobseeker’s allowance and the employment and support allowance. Both are being phased out to be replaced by universal credit, but hundreds of thousands of people remain on the old schemes, which use an IT system about 40 years old. Changes to the legacy benefit payments have apparently got to be fixed in the autumn in order to arrive by spring. These are administered by paper-based systems and ageing, inflexible IT systems that take months to process changes, while universal credit updates can be done in a matter of weeks. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “Parliament voted to end the complex web of six legacy benefits in 2012, and as this work approaches its conclusion in 2024 we are fully transitioning to a modern benefit, suited to the 21st century. “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £22bn across the next financial year including our household support fund. “Parliament voted in March 2022 to uprate benefits by the usual measure.”",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak says technical problems stopped him raising benefits more,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/rishi-sunak-says-technical-problems-stopped-him-raising-benefits-more
5/13/2022,"The Democratic Unionist party has chosen not to back the election of a new speaker for the Northern Ireland assembly as members gathered for the first time after last week’s elections. The move – which leaves the assembly unable to function – marks an escalation after the party previously indicated it would not nominate for the position of deputy first minister because of its hostility to the post-Brexit trading arrangements. Ninety newly elected members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) gathered at Stormont, outside Belfast, on Friday for what was meant to be the first day of business since the election. Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, the main nationalist and unionist parties are obliged to share power. Power sharing between the blocs requires both sides to agree on a speaker before electing a cross-community government. After Sinn Féin emerged in elections as the largest party for the first time, it meant the new first minister would be the party’s leader at Stormont, Michelle O’Neill. The party has said it will not nominate ministers to form a new executive until its concerns about the Northern Ireland protocol – which sets out post-Brexit trading arrangements for the country – are resolved. Unionists oppose the treaty because of the extent of the economic barriers it creates between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP’s leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said on Friday: “The protocol is a direct challenge to the principles that have underpinned every agreement reached in Northern Ireland over the last 25 years. It erodes the very foundations that devolution has been built upon.” New MLAs have been signing in. They designate themselves as “nationalist” or “unionist” – an arrangement designed to facilitate cross-community voting on certain key decisions – though members who do not wish to designate as either category are considered to be “others”. There has continued to be pressure from Sinn Féin and from other parties including the Alliance party, which has become Stormont’s third-largest party for the first time. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, said on Friday morning: “It’s hugely frustrating, as members of society, that we’re not going to have a government formed, that we’re not even going to have an assembly where the basics can be done, like scrutinising ministers who are still in post ” The assembly cannot fully operate without a speaker. This means bills cannot be scrutinised, debates cannot take place. New ministers, a new first minister and a new deputy first minister cannot be elected. But the situation is worse than anticipated after the DUP had signalled it would in effect stand in the way of the the appointment of a first and deputy first minister in the power-sharing executive. Northern Ireland is left with caretaker government. As a result of legislation introduced a few months ago, ministers are still technically in their posts and in charge of portfolios, but they are very limited in what they can do and, for example, cannot take cross-departmental decisions. Experts warn the situation cannot continue and governance in Northern Ireland will eventually come to a halt as the focus continues to shift to what the UK government will do. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has reiterated her threat to scrap parts of the protocol, which she has described as “the greatest obstacle” to forming a new Northern Ireland executive. Boris Johnson is expected to give a speech as soon as Monday on the future of the protocol after exchanges between Truss and the European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič, which a UK source described as “tetchy”.",News/Politics,What now for Northern Ireland as Stormont assembly grinds to halt?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/what-now-northern-ireland-assembly-stormont-grinds-halt
5/13/2022,"For more than five years Deborah James, the presenter of the BBC podcast You, Me and the Big C, has put a spotlight on a cancer otherwise left in the dark, and with such authority that she was awarded a damehood late on Thursday. With candour and humour, James has kept her co-hosts, listeners and social media followers up to date with her treatment for bowel cancer, even going so far as to dress up in a “poo suit” in a BBC recording studio. Bowel cancer can be a sticky subject matter. Although it is the fourth most common and second deadliest cancer in the UK, people shy away from talking about it owing to embarrassment about symptoms. The podcast has met with praise and admiration from charities, experts and patients. When Louise Bolotin came across James’s story she “felt some solidarity, because she’s at the stage where she’s at hospice at home care and that will be what happens to me as well.” Bolotin, 60, received a diagnosis in January after going to A&E with constant vomiting. Doctors discovered that the cancer in her bowel had spread to her liver, chest and lungs. “I had no idea that I had cancer, so when I was told not only do I have cancer but it’s terminal and it has already spread, that was a bit of a shock,” Bolotin said. Of James, she added: “We’re both in the same situation really. Both facing end of life.” James, who was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2016, said on Monday that she was under hospice at home care and “spending my time surrounded by my family”. By Friday her Bowelbabe Fund, with shared links to charities including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, had raised more than £4m. “Over the last five years, I’ve campaigned, I’ve spoken about awareness, I’ve shared my story, my reason for laughs, for giggles, for showing that you can live with cancer,” James told the BBC. “Before I die the one thing I knew I wanted to do was set up a fund that can continue working on things that gave me life.” James is a patron of Bowel Cancer UK, among other charities. After her news on Monday, traffic to the charity’s website surged to nine times that of a typical day. Genevieve Edwards, the charity’s chief executive, said: “She has this incredible ability to motivate people and get people talking about the signs and symptoms.” The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who donated to James’s fund, called her efforts to raise awareness and end the stigma around bowel cancer “inspiring”, and Boris Johnson said the damehood was richly deserved. “Deborah has been an inspiration and her honesty, warmth and courage has been a source of strength to so many people,” he tweeted. Prof David Cunningham, a consultant medical oncologist and director of clinical research at the Royal Marsden hospital in London, said he had no doubt James “has saved lives by encouraging people to see a GP about any worrying symptoms”. Bowel cancer predominantly affects people over 60, an individual’s risk also depends on their sex, genetics and lifestyle factors. When detected early it can be tackled with surgery, chemotherapy or other therapies. In England, guidelines call for testing for people over 50, including at-home faecal testing (FIT) or examinations done at clinics or hospitals. Symptoms include blood in stool, persistent change in bowel habits, stomach pains or lumps, sudden fatigue and weight loss. When the Guardian spoke to Bolotin, a retired freelance journalist and editor, she was travelling to Edinburgh to see a group of childhood friends for the last time. “I’m completely at peace with my decision and I’m expecting what’s coming, and in the meantime I’m just trying to live my life as best as I can,” she said. For others, she advised: “Keep an eye out for symptoms, but bear in mind that symptoms are not always obvious.”",News/Society,From stigma to spotlight: Deborah James puts focus on bowel cancer,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/13/from-stigma-to-spotlight-deborah-james-puts-focus-on-bowel-cancer
5/13/2022,"Good morning. For the first time since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, a court in Kyiv will hear a war crime trial of a Russian soldier accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian. Vadim Shysimarin, 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, is accused of fatally shooting the unarmed man after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. Shysimarin, who is now in custody, is also accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days, including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov who is accused of breaking into a house in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife in front of her underage child. This trial comes as the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato, with Sweden moving to follow suit. In the US, $40bn in aid for Ukraine has been held up because of one libertarian lawmaker: Rand Paul. In the aftermath of the leaked supreme court document foretelling the end to federal abortion protections, Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, vowed that “California will not stand idly by”. He proposed a new reproductive health spending plan, dedicating an additional $57m to prepare for an influx of people seeking abortions from other states. But while no other state does more to protect abortion access, abortions have long been inaccessible for many in California: 40% of counties in the state have no clinics providing abortions. Eleven people were killed and dozens were rescued after a boat capsized near Puerto Rico yesterday – the latest in a string of incidents across the region as people from Haiti and the Dominican Republic flee violence and poverty. Authorities said people on the boat were believed to be migrants. Although the nationalities of all those on board were not immediately known, at least eight Haitians were taken to the hospital. Stores around the country are running out of baby formula because of a combination of short- and long-term problems that has affected most of the larger US brands. Here’s everything you need to know about why it’s happening and what to do if you can’t find any in your local stores. The US justice department secretly issued a subpoena to gain access to details of the phone account of Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian’s investigations correspondent in Washington, in an attempt to uncover the source of articles about a review into family separation at the southern border conducted by the Department of Justice’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz. The move was carried out without notifying the newspaper or its reporter. Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, decried the action as “an egregious example of infringement on press freedom and public interest journalism by the US Department of Justice”. The House select committee investigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol has issued unprecedented subpoenas to five Republican members of Congress. Nearly 150 people have been killed in gang battles in Haiti in an increase of gun violence that has paralysed much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Cuban rescue workers recovered the body of the 45th and last person believed missing after an explosion at a luxury hotel in Havana. Grammy-award winning country musician Naomi Judd died last month by suicide, her daughter, the actor Ashley Judd, confirmed yesterday.

5/13/2022,"Danish mink breeders have turned their backs on the industry en masse after being forced to cull their animals over fears a Covid-19 mutation could pose a risk to human health. In November 2020, Denmark, at that point the world’s largest mink producer, controversially announced it would cull approximately 15 million animals due to fears a Covid-19 mutation moving from mink to humans could jeopardise future vaccines. The Danish government temporarily banned mink farming and the breeding of the animals for their fur, later extending the ban until 2023. Officials have now said just a handful of producers in the country have chosen to resume business if the ban lifts in 2023. Greece, Poland and North America are now expected to increase production to make up the shortfall. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (FVST) told the Guardian only 13 breeders had applied for the compensation that would allow them to potentially continue breeding mink in 2023. Another 1,246 breeders applied for the compensation to end their mink farming. The FVST said, since the cull, it had found three cases of illegally farmed mink, two in December 2021 and one in February 2022. It added that £2.1bn had been paid out in compensation to the industry after the ban. Denmark’s State Serum Institute (SSI) confirmed that the mutated virus that sparked the cull, known as Cluster 5, is now considered extinct. It has not been detected since September 2020. The Danish government is expected to issue a decision later this month on whether mink breeding can safely restart next year. It remains possible that limited breeding may be allowed. International Fur Federation CEO, Mark Oaten, was upbeat about global mink farming, pointing out that all North American mink have now received Covid-19 vaccinations, and that a European vaccination programme is under way. He was pessimistic, however, about Denmark. Even if breeding is allowed to continue next year, Oaten sees three barriers to its resumption. “The first problem is that the infrastructure has disappeared in Denmark, so it’s very hard to get hold of the feed,” he said. The second difficulty is that the government’s decision on a restart is being made only after the compensation deadline, making any restarts “a huge gamble”. A third factor, he said, is a generational issue, with many farmers reaching retirement age. More broadly, Oaten said it was a “hugely complex time” for the fur sector, with sanctions and lockdowns in two of its biggest markets, Russia and China, coming on top of the Danish mink shortfall of about 10 million pelts. In the longer term, Oaten said: “We are expecting countries like Greece and Poland and North America to help fill that shortfall [of pelts] but that will take a few years.” Nor does Oaten fear further bans in Europe, partly, he said, because of the negative fallout the Danish government faced for its mink cull. Animal welfare campaigners said legislative proposals to ban fur farming are now under consideration across Europe, including in Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria, with compensation being a key issue.

5/13/2022,"The “out of touch” award this week goes to Lee Anderson, a Conservative MP who claimed in the Commons that there isn’t a massive need for food banks in the UK. As he sees it, the problem is that families don’t know how to cook or budget. His comments were refuted by his local food bank as well as campaigners such as Jack Monroe, famed for her tight-budget recipes, who artfully put it: “The square root of fuck all is ALWAYS going to be fuck all, no matter how creatively you’re told to dice it.” One problem with out-of-touch politicians is that they are unable to imagine how bad things can get and overestimate the ability of families (and voters) to cope. Right now, the dashboard is flashing red. The Bank of England has forecast that inflation will reach 10% this year, as the energy price cap is lifted and the economic shocks from the war in Ukraine continue. For some families, the impact will be felt more deeply still – for those who live in poorly insulated homes, who are disabled and haven’t benefited from existing measures, or who already only spend on the bare essentials. The former boss of Sainsbury’s has declared that the UK’s “golden era” of cheap food is coming to an end. Two million adults didn’t eat for a whole day in the past month due to tight finances, and the National Institute for Economic & Social Research (NIESR) has warned that an additional 250,000 households face destitution in 2023. Inflation would be less of a problem if incomes were rising proportionately, but despite a tight labour market, wages are falling short of rising prices and pay packets are being spread increasingly thin. The problem is likely to get worse. As economists had already warned, higher prices of essentials are cutting into the money people have in their pockets to spend in shops, pubs and the wider economy. That’s having a knock-on impact on the UK’s consumption-dependent economy as a whole, raising the spectre of “stagflation”, when the economy shrinks but prices are generally rising. The future is therefore looking grim for ordinary families hoping to get by. Many of those on very low incomes are likely to find themselves going into high-cost debt to keep the lights on and food on the table over the next year. But the effects will be felt much more broadly – and by a broader section of the electorate. Predictably, the clarion calls for tax cuts and the gritting of teeth to ride out the pain have begun. Households falling into destitution is not inevitable. The biggest causes of current inflation are rising energy prices in the wake of the war in Ukraine and supply shortages exacerbated by lockdowns in China – though there are signs that inflation is now becoming more broad-based. The government may not be able to prevent these, but it can choose how to prepare and how to respond, including who in society is asked to bear the additional cost. Right now, many families across the country simply cannot bear that cost. The government could support them, and the economy as a whole, by finding better ways to get cash into pockets – fast. At a minimum, universal credit and legacy benefits should be increased in line with inflation. Boosting child benefit and expanding eligibility for the cold weather payment or winter fuel payment would also help. The costs of inflation could – at least in part – be borne by those making large and unearned profits from the higher prices that are causing so much economic pain. The first priority, to fund support for households, should be a windfall tax on the extraordinary excess profits of oil and gas companies benefiting from high global prices. Those profits are being distributed to shareholders rather than being invested – with only a small fraction of the returns going to UK pension funds or their ultimate recipients. As well as providing immediate support, government should be addressing the root causes of the UK’s vulnerability to inflation. That requires unhooking ourselves from our addiction to fossil fuels and reducing how much energy we use, which was yet again ignored in the Queen’s speech. A major programme to ensure every home is well insulated could ensure all homes are affordable to keep warm. This, together with an accelerated switch to green energy, is key to protecting the UK from the turbulence of the global energy market and Vladimir Putin’s actions. The government also urgently needs to increase the capacity of the UK economy to boost growth prospects and ensure stable demand doesn’t exceed shrinking supply. There are currently more than a million fewer people in the UK workforce than we’d have expected prior to the pandemic, with up to 400,000 missing because of health-related problems. Investment, for instance in health, social care and childcare, could enable people suffering ill-health themselves, or looking after others, to take part in work. The political risk for the government in failing to act is that they signal they are either out of touch with ordinary voters, or not on their side. IPPR North and Survation polled seats like Lee Anderson’s, which turned Conservative in 2019, and voters were far more likely to say that Labour understood their area than his own party. The politics of the coming months and years will be about which party can show it understands the crisis situation that so many are facing, and will stand on their side.

5/13/2022,"TerraUSD, the “algorithmic stablecoin” whose collapse prompted a multibillion-dollar selloff across crypto markets, has turned off its blockchain and been delisted from major exchanges, in effect shuttering the project for good. However, the wider impact of the project’s failure appears to have been constrained. TerraUSD was once valued at more than $40bn (£33bn). Shockwaves swept through cryptocurrency markets on Thursday as tether, the largest stablecoin and a foundational part of the digital asset ecosystem, broke its peg to the dollar. On Friday, however, tether was back to within a fraction of a per cent of its $1 peg and has successfully processed more than $3bn worth of withdrawals without issue. Bitcoin and ethereum, the two most important cryptocurrencies, have recovered from their lows of early Thursday. Bitcoin is trading at above $30,000 a coin, up from $27,000, while Ethereum is at $2,000, up from $1,700. Both remain far below where they were trading at the beginning of the week, however. Terra’s failure is likely to topple more dominoes, according to a warning from Fitch Ratings. “The failure of Terra’s peg has sent shocks through the decentralised finance sector, with a key saving and lending protocol, Anchor, seeing massive liquidation of UST-collateralised loans and the pricing of other crypto tokens also being affected,” the company said. “This has led to further liquidation triggers throughout the ecosystem … Bouts of volatility will probably continue as the crypto sector digests the repercussions of the failure of the UST peg.” Stablecoins are intended to maintain a fixed value, typically $1 a coin. But some, such as Terra, are “algorithmic” stablecoins, which maintain that price through a promise to print or destroy currency to match demand. That approach has been criticised as sharing elements with a Ponzi scheme, requiring regular inflows of new capital to maintain the peg, and prone to a “death spiral” if investors lose confidence. That death spiral has left Terra’s two tokens effectively valueless. UST, the stablecoin, is now trading at under 20¢, far from its dollar peg; and Luna, the freely floating token that is supposed to provide the backing for the algorithmic stability, has fallen from $81 a coin seven days ago to $0.00004 a coin. The death spiral was worsened on Friday morning, when the key players behind Terra agreed to disable the blockchain that makes the system work, leaving the remaining holders unable to receive rewards for participation. At the same time, cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and FTX moved to limit trading of the token, in an effort to protect naive investors from further losses. That was too late for some. The video game influencer KSI bought more than $3m worth of Luna on Tuesday, saying he had “always been a risk taker… I saw an opportunity and I had to take it.” His holdings are now worth less than $10.  Despite the crash, the UK government says it aims to make stablecoins a legal part of the country’s payments infrastructure. “Our ambition is to make Britain a global hub for crypto-asset technology,” a Treasury spokesperson said , “by creating a regulatory environment where firms can invest, innovate and scale up, while maintaining financial stability and regulatory standards to ensure people can use new technologies reliably and safely. “We are delivering on this ambition – by consulting on a future regulatory regime for crypto-assets, legislating to bring stablecoins into payments regulation, and exploring ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the crypto-asset market in the UK.”",News/Technology,TerraUSD ‘stablecoin’ delisted from crypto exchanges,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/13/terrausd-stablecoin-crypto-exchanges
5/13/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has claimed that quotes attributed to her by the News of the World in an interview about Peter Andre were made up by the tabloid newspaper. Vardy told the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial that the now defunct news outlet fabricated and exaggerated unspecified elements of her conversation: “There’s a lot of things that didn’t come out of my mouth, that were misrepresented,” she said. The high court heard Vardy deeply regretted agreeing to sell the story about her one-night stand with Andre to the defunct Sunday tabloid newspaper in 2004. The original article included alleged descriptions of the entertainer’s sexual performance and comparisons to a “chipolata”. Vardy, 40, said she was “was very young at the time” and had not had any further contact with Andre: “I haven’t spoken to him but I have sent his wife and him messages a couple of years ago.” She claimed she was forced to sell the story to the News of the World by her ex-husband Stephen Clarke. Clarke has always strongly denied forcing his ex-wife to sell the story and won a complaint on this matter with the press regulator Ipso when the accusation was first aired in 2017. Vardy is attempting to clear her name by bringing the multimillion-pound libel case against fellow footballer’s wife Coleen Rooney, after Rooney publicly alleged that Vardy leaked information from a private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun. As she finished giving evidence on the fourth day of the trial, Vardy described the experience of being cross-examined as “exhausting” and “intimidating” and left her feeling like “she’d been bullied”. She said she had no option but to bring the case against Rooney: “I didn’t do anything wrong and I want to clear my name - not just for me but for my family and my children.” She also denied deliberately destroying evidence in WhatsApp messages and “was having constant panic attacks” when she made a back-up that lost some potentially key files. Vardy had previously being accused of throwing her former agent and best friend Caroline Watt “under a bus” in a last-ditch attempt to shift the blame and save her case. Vardy has suggested that Watt may have been leaking stories from Rooney’s private Instagram account to the Sun without her knowledge. Under questioning from her own barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, Vardy told the court that she had given Watt the password to her personal Instagram account when she appeared on the ITV show I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! in 2017. This was because she was not allowed to maintain her own social media accounts while on the show – but it also enabled the agent to view Rooney’s private Instagram account. Vardy confirmed she knew that Watt was looking at Rooney’s private Instagram stories and posts but said she did not know how often and did not think the agent was actively monitoring the account. She also confirmed that she had discussed posts on Rooney’s private Instagram accounts with her agent, in the knowledge her agent was talking to journalists at the Sun about Rooney’s private life. However, Vardy insisted this was not evidence she was actively trying to leak information on Rooney to the Sun. At points the courtroom struggled to understand the workings of social media. Hugh Tomlinson QC, wearing a legal wig, asked Vardy: “Is there a difference in the way that stories and posts are displayed on the screen on an Instagram account?” The court has also repeatedly struggled to define the emojis used in Vardy’s WhatsApp exchanges and what they mean. At one point the court discussed her attempts to leak a story on the arrest of drink-driving footballer Danny Drinkwater to the Sun – and her original request for payment. She denied attempting to seek out Drinkwater’s home address in order to tip off paparazzi photographers and Vardy read out an emoji-laden message she sent to the footballer around the time of his arrest: “What have you done? Shocked face. FFS Danny. Crying face.” Vardy told the court that her husband, the Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy, was “quite angry” about reports that his then-England teammate Wayne Rooney had suggested his wife should keep a lower media profile. Vardy said she subsequently had a FaceTime video call with Wayne Rooney about the accusations and Rooney “said it was a load of bollocks”. Vardy strongly denies leaking stories about Coleen Rooney to journalists at the Sun. She told the she court she never had a personal relationship with the Sun journalist Andy Halls – who wrote some of the stories in question – and never went “for drinks or dinner” with him.

It is a recognisably northern European scene, wet, woody and clouded. Rubens relishes its leafy, shady subtleties. Landscape art was still new when he painted this pastoral moment. The first pure landscape in European art is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, but it was northern artists such as Albrecht Altdorfer and Pieter Bruegel the Elder who made it a genre in its own right. Rubens is recognisably indebted here to his Flemish predecessor: the birds in the trees and the figure of the shepherd are very Bruegelian. Rubens was friends with Pieter Bruegel’s son Jan: perhaps he knew the father’s great landscape drawings whose rich dense thickets this painting echoes. It’s a painting to enjoy on a rainy day, when its dreamy depths at once warm and refresh. National Gallery, London To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

5/13/2022,"A criminal investigation into water companies in England has uncovered suspected widespread illegal sewage discharges from treatment plants, the Environment Agency has revealed. The investigation into more than 2,200 water treatment plants run by all 10 water companies is examining whether the firms breached legal regulations about when and how frequently they are allowed to release raw sewage into waterways. The EA said an initial examination of hundreds of documents from the water firms “confirmed that there may have been widespread and serious non-compliance with the relevant regulations”. Breaching the legal regulations amounts to illegal dumping of raw sewage, and criminal penalties apply. Last year, Southern Water was fined a record £90m for illegally discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into coastal waters off Hampshire and Kent. The company argued in court that the discharges had not been deliberate, and said it was committed to transformation, transparency and cultural change. The revelations came as members of the public, NGOs and charities rejected as too little and too late government plans to cut the scale of raw sewage discharges into rivers and seas. Targets drawn up by government and put out to consultation include a requirement for water companies to reduce the frequency of discharges to bathing waters by 70% by 2035, or significantly reduce harmful pathogens they contain, for example by using ultraviolet radiation. By 2040, 160,000 discharges of raw sewage through storm overflows into all waters should be eliminated, and by 2050 ministers are promising to eliminate approximately 320,000 discharges, about 80% of the total, into all waters. The cocktail of pollutants choking English rivers comes from three main sources: • Agricultural pollution: the use of fertilisers and pesticides and the intensive farming of livestock and poultry can all contribute to poor water quality, as rainfall runoff from farm land carries chemicals and faecal matter into streams and rivers • Sewage and wastewater: discharges from combined sewer overflows, which should only be used after exceptional rainfall, are now routine. They combine with urban runoff as a huge chemical cocktail: faecal microbes, hydrocarbons, industrial chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals and personal care products • Runoff from towns, cities and transport, referred to as urban diffuse pollution. In built up areas, pollutants accumulate on hard surfaces such as roads and car parks which can then be washed into the sewer network during rainfall. It enters surface water drainage systems the pollutants are then discharged directly into rivers, streams or estuaries untreated where they can cause acute or chronic problems The latest Environment Agency figures recorded the scale of raw sewage discharges from the 15,000 storm overflows in England in 2021 as 372,533 discharges for a combined total of more than 2.7m hours. In 2020, there were more than 400,000 sewage discharges, totalling more than 3m hours. The majority, 55.2%, of the 18,268 people who responded to the consultation via 38 Degrees, an online platform that helps the public respond to government consultations, disagreed with the timescale and scope of the government’s targets. Questioned further, 83.9% said the timeframes being proposed by the government were much too long. Matt Richards, campaign manager at 38 Degrees, said: “The conclusion we can draw from this is that, regardless of people’s stated views of the proposed targets, the overwhelming majority want the government to move much quicker than they are currently proposing.” Christine Colvin, of the Rivers Trust, said: “We think this plan gives us too little, too late. We need to see a broader scope that includes clear milestones for government as well as water companies, and much more urgency and ambition. We want to have healthy rivers fit for people and wildlife within the decade, not by 2050.” Any release of raw sewage into rivers and coastal waters through storm overflows is supposed to take place only after exceptional weather and according to conditions in the permits issued by the EA. Fish Legal, in its response to the consultation, also rejected the timeline and ministers’ proposed approach. It said the ambition to cut discharges into bathing waters was “extremely limited”. The legal group also condemned the entire approach of the reduction plan. It said: “There appears to be an assumption running though this consultation that most storm overflows only happen due to excessive rainfall … The Environment Agency, as a regulator, also appear to have been working on that assumption … Our members and the public therefore do not share the Environment Agency’s confidence. “The Environment Agency has previously taken a passive approach to regulating these discharges, relying on the water companies to collect and even analyse the relevant data. If nothing else, the current major investigation into water companies’ permit compliance is a tacit admission that operator self-monitoring and self-reporting – a situation whereby the water companies oversee their own works and report their own permit compliance – has not worked.” A report by the environmental audit committee in January found that rivers were being subjected to a chemical cocktail of sewage, agricultural waste and plastic pollution.",News/Environment,"Sewage dumps into English rivers widespread, criminal inquiry suspects",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/13/sewage-dumps-into-english-rivers-widespread-criminal-inquiry-suspects
5/13/2022,"The massive and deadly floods that struck South Africa in April were made twice as likely and more intense by global heating, scientists have calculated. The research demonstrates that the climate emergency is resulting in devastation. Catastrophic floods and landslides hit the South African provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape on 11 April following exceptionally heavy rainfall. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa called the floods a “catastrophe of enormous proportions” and “the biggest tragedy we have ever seen”, later declaring a national state of disaster. At least 453 people were killed and the port of Durban, the largest in Africa, was closed, causing global disruption in the supply of food and minerals. Other recent studies found that the heatwave in the Pacific Northwest region of North America in 2021 would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, and that global heating exacerbated the extreme floods in Europe in July 2021 and the storms in Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique in January. “If we do not reduce emissions and keep global temperatures below 1.5C, many extreme weather events will become increasingly destructive,” said Dr Izidine Pinto, at the University of Cape Town and part of the team that conducted the analysis. “We need to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a new reality where floods and heatwaves are more intense and damaging.” Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London and also part of the team, said: “Most people who died in the floods lived in informal settlements, so again we are seeing how climate change disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable people. However, the flooding of the port of Durban is also a reminder that there are no borders for climate impacts. What happens in one place can have substantial consequences elsewhere.” A brutal heatwave is being endured in India and Pakistan and is certain to have been made worse by global heating. “There is no doubt that climate change is a huge game changer when it comes to extreme heat,” said Otto. “Every heatwave in the world is now made stronger and more likely to happen because of human-caused climate change.” Nick Silkstone, at the UK Met Office, said: “Temperatures are expected to peak on Saturday, when maximum values could reach around 49-50C [120-122F] in the hottest locations, such as Jacobabad, and the Sibi area of Pakistan. These values are around 5-7C above average for the time of year.” The analysis of the role of global heating in the South African floods used weather data and computer simulations to assess how likely the extreme rainfall was to happen in today’s heated climate – 1.2C hotter than before the industrial age – and in the unheated climate of the past. The results showed such extreme rainfall could now be expected about once every 20 years compared with only once every 40 years in the past, meaning it has become twice as likely. The assessment also showed the rainfall was 4-8% more intense than it would have been without climate change. This is consistent with scientific understanding of how climate change influences heavy rainfall. As the atmosphere becomes warmer it can hold more water, increasing the risk of downpours.",News/Environment,"South Africa’s April floods made twice as likely by climate crisis, scientists say",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/13/south-africa-floods-climate-crisis-global-heating
5/13/2022,"Ameditation on art and creativity, On Connection is the musician, playwright, novelist and performance poet Kae Tempest’s first work of nonfiction. Written early in the pandemic, this extended essay mixes memoir and philosophical musings as it examines the need “to play, to create, to reflect and release” and the ways these impulses connect us. Tempest – who uses they/them pronouns – narrates with a rhythmic urgency and fierce humanity that will be familiar to anyone who has seen them perform live. In the opening chapter, Sound Check, they talk of a numbness that can occur as a “logical response” to the sensory overload of everyday life, and the power of poetry to overcome it. Twenty years on the spoken word scene has shown Tempest how “naked language has a humanising effect; listening to someone tell their story, people noticeably [open] up, become more vulnerable, and let their defences down”. In Doors, they reveal how they used drugs and alcohol to cope with anxiety, depression and gender dysphoria, though, in the end “creativity reached through the fog when nothing else could”. Inspired by Carl Jung’s The Red Book, the psychoanalyst’s dive into the unconscious mind, Tempest advocates looking inwards to “face what is in ourselves”. Most powerful are the author’s reflections on the mysterious magic of performance during which they are “granted access to a freedom so resolute it leaves me shining head to toe. I emerge ... covered in a gluey light. Looking out at the crowd, I see reality at last.

5/13/2022,"The tumult of war and climate breakdown has proved lucrative for the world’s leading oil and gas companies, with financial records showing 28 of the largest producers made close to $100bn in combined profits in just the first three months of 2022. Buoyed by oil commodity prices that soared following the turmoil caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, major fossil fuel businesses enjoyed a bonanza in the first quarter of the year, making $93.3bn in total profits. Shell made $9.1bn in profit from January to March, almost three times what it made in the same period last year, while Exxon raked in $8.8bn, also a near threefold increase on 2021. Chevron upped its profits to $6.5bn and BP reveled in its highest first-quarter profits in a decade, making $6.2bn. Coterra Energy, a Texas-based firm, had the largest relative windfall of the 28 companies, with a 449% increase in profits on last year, to $818m. The rocketing profits, at a time when inflation has surged in many countries, has prompted several of the companies to return billions of dollars to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Ben Van Beurden, chief executive of Shell, said that the company’s performance “has been helped by the macro and the macro has been impacted by the war in Ukraine”. He added that this situation means “we do have a better company, we do have a better performance, and yes indeed our shareholders will benefit from that as well”. Murray Auchincloss, BP’s chief financial officer, said in February: “Certainly, it’s possible that we’re getting more cash than we know what to do with.” Climate campaigners, however, have called the profits “obscene” and argued that the provision of fossil fuels would not be so lavishly rewarding if governments had acted properly to confront the escalating climate crisis. “The greed of these companies is staggering,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, an advocacy group. “We’ve heard their executives bragging about how much the agony of inflation and the tragedy of the war in Ukraine has allowed them to raise prices. These profits are going right into their pockets.” While the oil companies contend that they do not themselves set the global price of oil, the surge in profits is jarring given scientists’ warnings that the world should be rapidly phasing down its use of fossil fuels if it is to avoid unleashing catastrophic heatwaves, drought, sea level rise and other worsening consequences of the climate emergency. The wealth of the oil and gas industry also highlights how there is still far more money flowing from the destruction of a livable climate than there is from efforts to maintain it. The 28 large oil and gas companies made a combined $183.9bn in profits in 2021, a sum that dwarfs several major, but floundering, climate measures. Wealthy countries have promised, but so far failed to deliver, $100bn a year to developing nations to help them cope with climate impacts, while the largest piece of legislation in US history to combat the climate crisis, which would have cost about $55bn a year over the next decade, was scuttled due to opposition from Republicans and the pro-coal Democratic senator Joe Manchin. The International Energy Agency has said that there can be no new oil or gas fields, or coal mines, if the world is to reach net zero plant-heating emissions by 2050. Nearly two-thirds of all identified oil and gas reserves will have to stay in the ground to avoid the planet breaching a 1.5C temperature rise above pre-industrial times, a threshold beyond which will cause compounding disasters, according to scientists. A huge tranche of new “carbon bomb” oil and gas projects is in train from industry, however, that risks blowing apart international climate goals, to the dismay of high-profile advocates. “Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness,” António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, said in April. “Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.” In the US, the mounting profits have irked Joe Biden, who has complained that gasoline costs faced by drivers have remained elevated despite a recent cooling off in oil prices. The president’s Democratic allies in Congress have proposed a new windfall tax for oil firms that would be used to send payments to Americans affected by rising cost of living expenses. “Never content to let a crisis go to waste, oil executives are taking advantage of the international situation by using their windfall profits to juice their own pay and pursue share buybacks,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator who has spearheaded a bill that would impose the tax. “We should be clawing back big oil’s excessive profits and sending them to the Americans who paid exorbitant prices at the gas pump.” Most of the large oil companies now have their own climate goals, such as Exxon’s pledge in January to cut its own emissions to net zero by 2050. However, these promises are mostly centered on emissions coming from the operations of drilling and transporting oil and gas, rather than their actual use by consumers, which constitutes the lion’s share of pollution. Few companies are reporting on their investments in clean energy, such as wind or solar power, or efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Those firms that do cite these figures reveal that such climate-friendly investments are a very minor sideline, typically just a few percentage points of overall budgets. “We are seeing investment in these things but the levels aren’t meeting the science-based trajectory we need to be on to align with 1.5C,” said Simon Fischweicher, head of corporations and supply chains at CDP, a non-profit that helps companies disclose their environmental impact. CDP has estimated that the oil industry would have to invest three-quarters of its capital expenditure into low-carbon technologies if disastrous climate change is to be avoided. “There is a significant gap between what needs to happen and what is being promised,” said Fischweicher. “We haven’t seen the commitments in renewables that match the ambition required. I just haven’t seen any of these companies commit to net zero for the use of their products. There’s a lot more to do.”",News/Business,Largest oil and gas producers made close to $100bn in first quarter of 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/13/oil-gas-producers-first-quarter-2022-profits

5/13/2022,"Appliance by JO Morgan (Vintage, £16.99)The first work of prose fiction by the award-winning poet whose previous book, The Martian’s Regress, revelled in science fictional tropes, this is a collection of thematically linked short stories about the development of a matter transmitter from a cabinet resembling a refrigerator into a vast network of stations transporting not only goods but people all over the world. The approach is almost primitive, focusing on a single idea which is seldom dramatised, only discussed. But the very ordinariness of the characters and their conversations has a demystifying effect: in this context transporters could as well be aeroplanes or the internet. The notion of progress, and where new technologies may take us, is a consistent concern in SF, whether utopian or dystopian. Morgan takes neither approach as he gradually builds a picture of the ease and speed with which some people embrace new ways of living, while others, regardless of objections, eventually have it forced upon them: living off-grid is a fantasy few can afford. Book of Night by Holly Black (Cornerstone, £16.99)Charlie Hall wants to go straight, but conning people, uncovering secrets and stealing valuable books are what she’s good at – so when she hears that the Liber Noctem, a legendary book of spells, has gone missing, she’s drawn back into the dangerous world of shadow-magic. In her first novel for adults, the bestselling children’s fantasy author has created an original, convincing world in which a subculture of magicians known as “gloamists” work their sorcery by drawing on the power of shadows – their own, or those of others. Shadows can provide power or take it, may be shaped, lost or stolen. It’s a wonderful invention, well worked out and original, yet striking a profound mythic note, the way the best fantasies can. Troubled, smart bad-girl Charlie is a believable, sympathetic character. With a gripping, perfectly paced story and a killer ending, this dark fantasy feels like an instant classic. The Pharmacist by Rachelle Atalla (Hodder & Stoughton, £16.99)The setting for this compelling debut novel is a bunker where 0.2% of a UK city’s population has survived for more than half a year. The titular pharmacist, Wolfe, gives no details about the nuclear war that must have sent them underground. She tells herself she is lucky to have a place inside, and an occupation. The others are mostly politicians, bankers and wealthy businessmen close to “the leader”, and she’s one of the few there who had to leave her family behind. In an unexpected meeting with the leader in his heavily guarded lair, she notes he still has access to art and other prohibited luxuries. The people who work for him also benefit, and when he asks her to report on her neighbours she barely hesitates. But when his demands escalate, how far from morality will self-interest take her? Reminiscent of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, this unsettling story is a nightmare for our times of end-of-the-world prepping, increased nuclear insecurity and political inequality. Beautiful Star by Yukio Mishima (Penguin, £12.99)Mishima was one of the most famous Japanese writers of the 20th century, yet this 1962 novel has not been published in English before now – probably reflecting the low esteem in which science fiction was held in literary circles. The story concerns a family whose lives revolve around flying saucer sightings and the belief that each family member came from other planets, before uniting on Earth to try to save humanity from nuclear destruction. Eventually they meet other aliens who think humans would be better off dead. Mishima had a deep interest in UFOs, and belonged to the Japan Flying Saucer Research Association, an organisation whose declared ultimate goal was world peace. This is a strange, rather awkward novel that moves from vividly described scenes of ordinary human life and the beauties of the natural world to arguments about human nature and whether peace is possible this side of death. Eversion by Alastair Reynolds (Orion, £20)Reynolds is best known as an author of hard science-based space operas, yet his latest novel begins on board a ship sailing up the coastline of Norway in the early 19th century. The mystery deepens as the same group of people, on a different vessel with the same name, reappear in different places and times, always seeking out the same mysterious edifice. It would be unfair to reveal more details of this wonderfully entertaining puzzle wrapped inside an adventure story, which turns out to be science fictional after all. A clever diversion from a writer who is always worth reading.",Arts/Books, The best recent science fiction and fantasy – reviews roundup,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/13/the-best-recent-science-fiction-and-fantasy-reviews-roundup
5/13/2022,"The Championship campaign has been quite the white-knuckle ride for Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest, whose stressed-out fans must now contend with the anguish of being put through the playoff wringer. The idea of promotion to the top flight was extremely fanciful for both clubs in the early months of the season, with bad starts prompting concerns that they were more likely to go down than up. But after their playoff semi-final that starts on Saturday at Bramall Lane, one of these storied clubs will be a Wembley showpiece away from football’s fabled “dreamland”. It has been some journey, given the nightmarish way their campaigns opened. United were relegated from the Premier League with Paul Heckingbottom in interim charge after the dismissal of Chris Wilder last March and their owners opted against giving him the manager’s job full-time. Instead, they brought in the more experienced Slavisa Jokanovic. It would quickly prove a costly mistake. With promotions from the Championship with Watford and Fulham on his CV, the Serb had seemed a wise choice, but a change in formation led to a more pedestrian style, poor results and extreme dissatisfaction in the Bramall Lane stands. Jokanovic was dismissed six months and 22 games into his three-year deal, with United 16th. Heckingbottom, in charge of the under-23s, was again handed the reins, only this time permanently in an move some considered to be the cheap option. His appointment was not greeted with unanimous approval by United’s fans. Below them, Forest were in the process of dragging themselves up the table after a disastrous opening few weeks that left them bottom with one point. It prompted the sacking of Chris Hughton after six defeats in seven matches, their worst start in more than a century. Having got through 13 managers in the previous 10 years some stability was urgently required and Steve Cooper, who had led Swansea City to back-to-back playoffs before leaving last July, was identified as the man to provide it. “It doesn’t cost anything to be humble, it doesn’t cost anything to work hard, it doesn’t cost anything to show respect,” he told a fans’ group not long into his tenure. “As much as I want to build an identity and play a certain way, I also want us to show real core values of what it takes to be a real football club. There’s got to be a set of principles that you stick to, that you really believe in. Build from the back, be exciting, get good numbers up the pitch, get good attacks, create real opportunities to score.” At United, Heckingbottom set about changing fortunes by returning to the 3-5-2 that had served them so well in their first season back in the Premier League under Wilder and ramping up the intensity of training. “You just saw that on a match day,” said the right-back George Baldock in an interview with Sky Sports in November. “Everyone was a lot more intense. When you play at that intensity, you cause the opposition a lot more trouble.” Cooper, a former England Under-17s coach who has worked at the Wrexham and Liverpool academies, was quick to extol the virtues of youth upon taking over at Forest. “I believe a thriving Championship team has good young players in it,” he said. “Teams that have done well in the Championship have had homegrown players in them who are running a bit more with that youthful enthusiasm. I want homegrown players in the squad.” In 20-year-old Brennan Johnson, recently awarded the Championship’s Young Player of the Season award, Cooper and Forest have a midfielder who could scarcely be more enthusiastic and he has chipped in with 16 league goals and 10 assists this season. His consistently outstanding displays have attracted the attention of several Premier League clubs and Forest could struggle to keep him, even if they win promotion. Djed Spence, on loan from Middlesbrough, is another youngster who has excelled, the right-back catching the eye of a wider TV audience with a barnstorming display as Forest knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup. Available from Boro for about £17m, the 21-year-old is believed to have admirers at Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool, among other elite clubs, but reports suggest he is prepared to commit to Forest if they go up. At Sheffield United’s recent end-of-season awards, Morgan Gibbs-White made off with the two most prestigious gongs, winning player of the season and young player of the season after scoring 11 goals and providing nine assists as his side steadily made their way up to fifth. On loan from Wolves, the 22-year-old’s future is also uncertain but it seems inconceivable that he will not be a top-flight player next season, whether or not the Blades win promotion.

5/13/2022,"The high-end Chinese chain Tattu, with homes in Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, has arrived close to Tottenham Court Road station in London just as the scaffolding, cranes and general upheaval that has tormented the area for more than a decade begins to subside. The making of the new Elizabeth line has hampered Denmark Street, AKA Tin Pan Alley, and its environs for a very long time. Such a long time, in fact, that many of the 400,000 people a day who are expected to pass by the all-new, space-age Outernet building will have no memory of this neighbourhood’s former reassuringly shabby loveliness. Outernet is a £1bn music venue, office space, luxury hotel and lifestyle mothership that has gobbled up an entire block between New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road, and its entrance is marked by badly dressed door persons in ill-fitting, steampunk-style frock coats. I could devote this whole column to the plethora of jaw-dropping, state-of-the art solutions Outernet will be providing for central London – it has the world’s largest high-resolution wraparound screens, everyone! – but I came here for the food and, by golly, Tattu has got it, albeit in very small portions of wagyu fillet carpaccio at £34.90 a throw. Or, say, four pretty chicken truffle shumai dim sum at £12.90, or wok-fired “angry bird” chicken (sweet-and-sour chicken with a few floating chillies to you and me) at £24.90 and only just enough to feed one. Tattu, much like Outernet itself, is big and bolshie in every sense. It is less of a restaurant and more of an Instagram content fulfilment hub with added £9 broccoli and £36.50 char siu monkfish. It is impossible to take a bad photo in here. The lighting is beautiful and several plates have pure novelty aspect, billowing smoke, cloches and/or googly eyes. This is a lavish, fake blossom-strewn, luxury amusement park ride imagining of, according to the PR spiel, a traditional Chinese courtyard house. Tattu is the perfect place to be photographed under a blossom chandelier while sipping a smoking skull cocktail or poking a plate of colourful, £14.50 royal koi fish gau dim sum. Readers, I actually did this myself, posing, then posting a story of me watching a server unveil a chocolate “dragon egg” from under a smoking cloche, because living the ’gram life is pernicious. Ask yourself, if a woman eats shiitake bao (£11.50) on a rooftop in a fake Chinese courtyard, but there is nothing on Instagram to prove it, did it really happen? It’s lovely to see, once, but there are a hundred small Chinese places less than a mile down the road in, ahem, Chinatown that serve far more delicious food for a fraction of the price. Tattu is divided into four separate residences, themed around phoenix, koi, dragon and tiger, which means the dining room is confusing to navigate around, although, on the day I ate there, it was staffed plentifully with the sort of people who let you wander about for ages looking for your table, the bathroom or the lifts without quite realising it’s their job to steer you. Oh, how I miss the days when places were staffed by folk who had worked in a restaurant before, but, alas, here we are. The menu is brief and sort-of Chinese by way of Great Britain with South American and pan-European flourishes; it’s also littered with words and phrases such as “XO scallops”, “salmon caviar” and “wagyu” that make you feel you’re somewhere the Kardashians would enjoy. There’s a handful of dim sum options, 10 “raw” or “hot” small plates and 10 “large” plates. Spoiler: they are not large and prices hover around the £30-40 mark for lemon salt and black pepper lamb cutlets or Chilean sea bass with shaoxing wine and smoked bacon, before rocketing off into la-la land with £80 for green pepper lobster with jalapeños and crisp shallots. The cost is vastly offputting. I could almost tolerate giving Tattu £12 for dim sum, and that shiitake bao turned out to be nicely wobbly and moist, but had largely unmemorable innards. Delicate chicken truffle shumai were prettily puckered like little cats’ bums topped with a scattering of truffle. The best thing we ate was seven-spiced seared tuna from the raw small-plates section, featuring fine-quality tuna with some smoke from the grill, truffle and citrus ponzu and enough caviar to cover a Barbie doll’s forehead. At the main courses, my eyes danced around the page, rebelling about handing Tattu just north of £36 for a piece of honey-glazed monkfish. It arrived, just as I’d dreaded, overcooked to the point of dry, in a sweet caramel orange puddle. The “angry bird” chicken was a bowl of vivid red, sugary sauce concealing cashews, red pepper and a few bits of chicken garnished with past-its-best coriander. Entry level steamed jasmine rice is £6.50 on top, while candy rice with beetroot and ginger is a laughable £9. Pudding of “wood-smoked dragon egg” came under a cloche of steam, to reveal something that Thorntons would sell off after Easter for 88p and that tasted of almost nothing. Tattu as a restaurant and a bill will live on in my mind for ever. The memory is indelible. Tattu The Now Building Rooftop, Outernet, Denmark Place, London WC2, 020-3778 1985.

5/13/2022,"The public are being urged to keep an eye out for any signs of disease in local trees, as the UK launches a hi-tech, £5.8m tree laboratory to fight the spread of pests and diseases. The UK is especially vulnerable to the growing spread of plant pathogens because of warmer, wetter winters, and because it is a hub for global trade. The new research laboratory is set to address these threats by clamping down on pests in the UK and abroad, including the oak processionary moth, emerald ash borer and citrus longhorn beetle. The Forest Research Holt Laboratory in Surrey – a key part of the new Centre for Forest Protection – will be able to analyse and investigate reports of disease faster and more thoroughly than ever. The public can report sightings via the Tree Alert site, and a specialist will come and look at the tree, or send samples for further testing. “The public are our eyes and ears on the ground,” said Gerard Clover, head of tree health at Forest Research, which is part of the Forestry Commission. “It’s beholden on all of us to play our part in reporting unusual pests and diseases, unusual signs and symptoms.” More than 3,700 reports from the public were registered between April 2021 and March 2022, 25% up on the previous year. “We would anticipate that will grow as we raise public awareness. As people report things, this will enable us to respond and to diagnose those in a timely fashion,” Clover said. “This represents a real step-change in our capacity and capability. It’s a very significant investment.” As part of the project, a mobile field lab – a van retrofitted with a mini lab inside – will be driving around the country doing tests on site, meaning disease can be diagnosed more quickly. Helicopters are already scanning forests from above. Projects include studying risks to UK forestry from non-native trees and from the pinewood nematode pest, as well as looking at replacements for “lost” tree species. Last year, a Woodland Trust report found that only 7% of the UK’s native woodland was in good condition, with imported pests and diseases one of the leading threats, along with destruction by development and the impact of the climate crisis and pollution. In the past 30 years, the UK has seen the arrival of more than 20 serious tree pests and diseases. Sir William Worsley, chair of the Forestry Commission, said: “We are taking the whole issue of tree health really, really seriously. Those involved are first class and it gives me confidence that we are on top of the game. It’s being aware of risk management, and then taking appropriate action with haste.” The National Trust felled at least 30,000 ash trees last year as a result of dieback, with warnings that there would be a “catastrophic” increase in disease because of the climate crisis. Ash dieback – which is spread by fungal spores – is among diseases that experts can do little to contain once they have spread. Researchers will be collaborating with institutions overseas, including in France, Portugal, Italy and Canada. Emergency legislation was introduced to ban imports of wood from certain areas in France and Italy after the pine processionary moth was detected. Five to 10 pests are being added to the UK plant health risk register every month, according to Prof Nicola Spence, UK chief plant health officer, which makes it extremely challenging to reduce overall disease. The increase in storms is also damaging trees and making them more vulnerable to infection. “We can’t predict what the trajectory and possible risks are,” Spence said. “Of course climate change also exacerbates that because things are moving beyond their historical range.” Trees are a crucial part of the UK’s strategy to tackle the climate emergency, and the Committee on Climate Change has recommended planting 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of woodland every year until 2025. The UK is considered one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, and planting native forests is key to restoring habitats. Alisha Anstee, policy lead on tree health and invasive species at the Woodland Trust, welcomed the investment. She said: “We hope this expansion in the UK’s capacity and capability will help to combat existing pests and diseases that are causing havoc on our treescapes and woodlands. We also hope it will address the threats posed from overseas pests and diseases that have not arrived in the UK and, crucially, must not arrive – such as the emerald ash borer. But, she added: “We must stress this is only one element of what is needed to safeguard our trees, both now and into the future … Critically, we must keep focus on the importance of prevention. With two new pests and diseases being found in the UK in the last six months alone, we must not overlook the urgent need to reduce our reliance on tree imports by investing in our domestic nursery sector. “Continued loss of trees to pests and diseases will dramatically impede the UK’s ability to increase tree cover to meet climate targets and address the spiralling biodiversity crisis.” Ash dieback Caused by a fungus which arrived in Europe 30 years ago from Asia, it is expected to kill 80% of the UK’s ash trees. Fungal spores can blow tens of miles making it pretty much impossible to contain. It was first recorded in south-east England in 2012 and is now widespread. In summer, diseased ash trees get dark patches on their leaves, which then wilt and fall off. Dark brown lesions form on the trunk and eventually the whole tree dies. Dutch elm disease An aggressive form of this disease arrived in the UK in the 1960s and spread so rapidly that by 1980 the majority of English elm were dead. It is caused by a fungus spread by the elm bark beetle, which feeds on the tree. As it feeds, spores of the fungus enter inside and release toxins which cause the tree to die. Dutch elm disease turns leaves yellow, before they fall off and die. Twigs turn down, making a “shepherd’s crook”. Under the bark there will be dark brown streaks on the outer wood. Oak processionary moth First identified in London in 2006, it probably arrived on imported live wood. It has since been found in some surrounding counties. The caterpillars will be emerging over the next three months. They are black with long white hairs and move in long nose-to-tail processions, which give them their name. The nests are usually the shape of a dome or teardrop and are around the size of a tennis ball. They strip bark off oak trees and cause them to lose their leaves. The caterpillars can cause rashes and breathing difficulties, and should not be touched. Larger eight-toothed European spruce bark beetle In 2018, a population was discovered in Kent, and several more have since been found, with outbreaks in East Sussex, too. There is concern it could cause significant damage to the UK’s spruce timber industry. The best way to identify the beetle, which mainly inhabits stressed or weak trees, is to pick off a section of bark. Under the bark they produce a distinctive pattern of grooves where the larvae have burrowed. They form a shape that looks a bit like a fish bone and the grooves get wider as the larvae grow. Phytophthora pluvialis This fungus-like pathogen has no common name, and was discovered in Cornwall in 2021. Since then outbreaks have been found elsewhere in England, as well as Scotland and Wales. It can affect western hemlock, Douglas fir and several species of pine. It produces a gooey, white slime and lesions in the stem, branches and root of the tree, which look like someone has sliced sections of bark off with a knife. It causes needles to turn brown and fall off, and new shoots to die.

5/13/2022,"When House of Cards landed on Netflix with an almighty thump just under a decade ago, it felt like a paradigm-shifting moment for television: not only because it heralded the arrival of Netflix as a major player, able to coax A-list actors and creators to the world of streaming, but also because of what it meant for how we watched TV itself. An entire series released at once, able to be gobbled up in one go? Who could possibly argue with that! Soon Netflix was dumping a preposterous number of shows on to their platform in the same manner. Other streamers soon followed suit, and then even traditional broadcasters. The era of binge-watching had arrived. There was no going back. Well, err, about that … Fast-forward nine years later (skipping the intro on the way, naturally), and the binge-watching model is in retreat. We have returned to a place where the must-watch shows of 2022 – the likes of Yellowjackets, Severance, The Dropout, Moon Knight, Winning Time – are adopting the good old-fashioned weekly model. Most streamers have either abandoned the all-at-once approach (Amazon), only periodically dabble in it (BBC iPlayer, who occasionally drop full series, depending on the show, and never for their massive series that rely on overnight ratings), or have never embraced it in the first place (Disney+, Apple TV+ and of course networks like HBO). Only Netflix, originators of the binge-watch model are holding firm, and as you might of heard, they’re in a bit of a pickle right now. So why have we gone cold on binge-watching? Arguably the model’s fatal flaw, as many have pointed out, is its inability to replicate the ‘water-cooler’ feel of weekly appointment TV. I first noticed this when Netflix released the much-maligned fourth season of Arrested Development way back in 2013, and my friends were watching the show at completely different speeds. Any proper discussion about the show had to wait until the slowest of our group had finally gotten to the end of the season, weeks after the rest of us. It all felt anti-climactic (a bit like the season itself). That’s a sharp contrast with, say, Severance, whose weekly release schedule allowed viewer excitement to build in unison towards that sensational season finale (sorry, but I will not stop banging on about that finale). Of course the flip side to that is that, when it comes to avoiding spoilers, you have to be as fast as the fastest viewer. Chris Ryan, host of excellent pop culture podcast The Watch, was bemoaning that fact on a recent episode of the pod. He had burned through the final episodes of Ozark in one weekend in order to avoid the inevitable spoilery thinkpiece headlines and social media chatter that would be inevitably churning around the internet, but by doing so had robbed himself of some of the enjoyment that comes with watching a show’s climax. Compare that to something like Breaking Bad, whose heart-stopping final episodes were delivered in anticipation-building weekly doses, and I know which model I’d opt for. But the main reason I think binge-watching is such a turn-off in 2022 is due to the sheer amount of TV on TV right now. I can’t remember a moment like this, when so many high-profile shows are airing at the same time. It’s overwhelming enough, and the idea of all of them arriving in full at once is more intimidating still. In that context, the weekly drip drip of shows feels like a blessing. When it comes to the age of peak TV, sometimes less is more.

5/13/2022,"Thousands of women in England and Wales with fibroids are to be offered a new tablet to ease their symptoms as an alternative to injections or surgery. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the womb. About one in three women develop them at some point in their life. They most often occur in those aged between 30 and 50. Symptoms can include prolonged and heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain and pressure, and fertility problems. There are currently limited long-term treatment options. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has recommended a new treatment – relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate, also called Ryeqo – be offered on the NHS in final draft guidance. About 4,500 women will be eligible. Taken once a day as a single tablet, comprising 40mg relugolix, 1mg estradiol and 0.5mg norethisterone acetate, the treatment is another option for women with moderate to severe symptoms, Nice said. It works by reducing the release of hormones that control oestrogen and progesterone production by the ovaries. Relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate offers an effective alternative to surgery and injectable gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, which also work to reduce the production of oestrogen and progesterone in the ovaries. Clara Amfo, the BBC Radio 1 DJ, has previously spoken about her experience of living with fibroids. She told Radio 1’s Life Hacks: “A lot of people don’t know what they are. So they are basically non-cancerous growths that can appear on the womb. “The blessing is they are non-cancerous, which is a plus, but they still cause a lot of problems around fertility, enjoyment of sexy time, with your digestive system, with your urinary system, heavy periods. “I developed anaemia because my periods were very heavy. I was losing a lot of blood because of them.” Amfo recently had surgery to remove six large fibroids. “The recovery was so tough,” she said. “It was keyhole surgery but it was still invasive.” Helen Knight, interim director of medicines evaluation at the Nice Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said fibroids could have a “profound effect” on women because of their ability to cause “many debilitating symptoms”. “This treatment has the potential to improve quality of life,” she said. “As well as effectively reducing symptoms, it can be taken at home and is therefore more convenient than the injectable treatment, given in a hospital setting. “It can also be used long term, which could mean improved and sustained symptom relief, it is well-tolerated, and it will mean thousands of women can avoid invasive surgery which always carries some risk.” Maria Caulfield, the minister for women’s health, said: “Around one in three women can suffer from uterine fibroids at some point in their life – the symptoms can have a profound impact on women’s health and lead to infertility if untreated. “So this is another groundbreaking step forward to not only improve women’s quality of life and reduce symptoms, but to give them greater choice in the medication available and options for alternative, less invasive treatment.”",News/Society,‘Groundbreaking’: NHS advised to offer women tablet for fibroids,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/13/nhs-women-tablet-fibroids-nice
5/13/2022,"The defence minister, Peter Dutton, has called the presence of a Chinese spy ship off the coast of Western Australia an “act of aggression” but his department was far more sober in its assessment and international law experts have poured cold water on the claim. It is not the first time such Chinese vessels have been in Australia’s exclusive economic zone. So, given we are a week out from an election and the Coalition wants the narrative refocused through a “we live in uncertain times” lens, let’s put the politics aside and step through the facts. The first thing to say is that the Australian Defence Force and border force are doing their jobs. They, rightly, are monitoring the approaches to Australia and detected a People’s Liberation Army-Navy (PLA-N) ship called Haiwangxing operating off the north-west shelf of Australia a week ago. So far, this ship has had five “interactions” with Australian P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft, three with Dash 8 aircraft and one with a patrol boat. This Chinese intelligence collection vessel crossed Australia’s exclusive economic zone (not our territorial sea) on the morning of 6 May, a map released by Defence shows. The ship travelled south and passed Exmouth on 8 May before turning around on 10 May and heading north again. Defence says the ship’s closest point of approach to Harold E Holt Communication Station was about 50 nautical miles (93km) on Wednesday morning. It has been heading north-east since then and was 250 nautical miles (463km) north-west of Broome on Friday morning. Defence speculates the ship could be off Darwin (don’t mention the war over the port’s 99-year lease) by Sunday if it continues its current route. But what about the politics? In a press conference in Perth, Dutton on Friday said it was “very strange” and “unprecedented” that the ship had sailed so far south off the WA coast. He argued it was “hugging the coastline as it goes north and its intention will be to collect as much electronic intelligence as it can”. Dutton said the ship had been “in close proximity to military and intelligence installations on the west coast of Australia”. (This welcome transparency of course comes from a government that brought us a blanket of secrecy about “on-water matters” when discussing asylum-seeker boats.) “It is an act of aggression – I think particularly because it has come so far south,” Dutton said, before pivoting to a partisan election campaign message when asked about recent criticism from the Labor WA premier, Mark McGowan. Dutton implored any voters concerned about national security or “the situation in the Indo-Pacific” to take the “much safer bet” of Scott Morrison as prime minister and him as defence minister. Given we are in caretaker mode, an obvious question is: was the federal opposition fully briefed? It is understood Labor was given a heads-up on the general nature of the announcement shortly before the press conference. Dutton and the shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, then had a preliminary conversation about the warship after the press conference. O’Connor later issued a statement saying Labor “shares concerns” about the vessel’s surveillance operations off Australia’s west coast and he had “sought a more comprehensive briefing”. A second question is whether Dutton was correct to label the ship’s presence an act of aggression. His department didn’t contradict him but, in a statement issued shortly after his press conference, it vowed to “continue to monitor” the situation and had a noticeably different tone about the ship’s presence off the WA coast. “Australia respects the right of all states to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace, just as we expect others to respect our right to do the same,” the defence department said in a statement that would have been cleared by Dutton’s office. The message underlying this comment was: Australia has freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, too. Morrison in November 2021 was asked about a Chinese naval vessel in Australia’s exclusive economic zone. There was no talk of “act of aggression” then. “They have every right to be there under international maritime law, just like we have every right to be in the South China Sea,” Morrison said at the time. It was a similar response in July 2021 when a Chinese surveillance ship was heading towards Queensland in an apparent attempt to monitor a joint military exercise with the US. “We don’t raise any issue about that,” Morrison said. “Of course we watch them. We’re aware of that. And they’re watching us.” On Friday afternoon, possibly playing “good cop” to Dutton’s “bad cop”, Morrison didn’t specifically repeat the “act of aggression” framing. The prime minister simply said that when taken “together with the many other coercive acts and the many statements that have been made attacking Australia’s national interests”, the ship’s presence was not “an act of bridge-building or friendship”. Experts point out Australia’s territorial sea extends just 12 nautical miles (22km) from the coastline. In the exclusive economic zone, which stretches out to 200 nautical miles (370km), Australia has rights to regulate fishing. Countries have freedom of navigation and overflight in the EEZ – they just can’t start exploiting resources or fisheries. Donald Rothwell, a professor of international law at the Australian National University, said that based on the information to hand, it appeared “that at all times the ship was within Australia’s exclusive economic zone and was acting lawfully under international law”. Rothwell said the ship’s presence appeared to “represent a pattern whereby the PLA-N is seeking to test Australia’s resolve in respecting the freedom of navigation, which has in recent years also been contested by Australian actions and diplomatic statements vis-a-vis China and the South China Sea”. “This is not an act of aggression and is in fact fairly standard activity for navies to collect intelligence and undertake surveillance within the exclusive economic zone of other countries,” he said. “The US Navy does it regularly in the South China Sea including the Chinese exclusive economic zone. This is where the precise location of the ship is critical – within the exclusive economic zone these activities are permissible while within the 12 nautical mile territorial sea these activities would not be permissible and could very legitimately be treated much more seriously by Australia. “That the Australian response by RAN and RAAF has been to undertake monitoring and surveillance of the Chinese ship certainly indicates this is not an act of aggression.” Tim Stephens, a professor of international law at the University of Sydney, agrees that it’s “certainly not an act of aggression”. He said ships had no legal requirement to notify countries about passage through their EEZ, although that would be “a matter of courtesy to avoid misunderstanding”. Stephens said the ship’s visit could certainly be described as provocative but “legally it would never be considered an act of aggression”. “I think it’s entirely rhetorical,” he said.",News/Australia news,It’s unprecedented for Dutton to label a Chinese spy ship sailing outside Australia’s territory an ‘act of aggression’ | Daniel Hurst,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/its-unprecedented-for-dutton-to-label-a-chinese-spy-ship-sailing-outside-australias-territory-an-act-of-aggression
5/13/2022,"Nearly 150 people have been killed and scores wounded during gunfights between warring gangs in Haiti, as the latest surge of violence has paralysed much of the sprawling capital, Port-au-Prince. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Thursday that it had treated more than 96 people with gunshot wounds in its medical facilities in Port-au-Prince since 24 April. “The number of trauma admissions received per week tripled compared to mid-April, and most of them are very serious gunshot wounds that require extensive care,” said Mumuza Muhindo, MSF head of mission in Haiti, in a statement on Thursday. “The Haitian population is in an extremely vulnerable situation.” Earlier this week, the National Human Rights Defense Network found that as many as 148 people had been killed during intense battles between the 400 Mawozo and Chen Mechan, two feared rival gangs. During a bloody fortnight of battle, gang members raped women and girls and burned people alive, the organisation said in a report on Tuesday. In one neighbourhood, gangs killed 47 people before burning 17 of the bodies and burying the rest in mass graves. “A massacre of incredible cruelty was perpetrated,” claims the report, which says that authorities did little to stem the violence. “At the highest level of the state, there was no reaction.” Many residents fleeing violence have arrived to makeshift shelters, sometimes just a few blocks from their homes, where they face little humanitarian assistance and risk exploitation, according to charities working in the capital. Roadblocks have been thrown up in gang-controlled neighbourhoods across Port-au-Prince, preventing ambulances and aid vehicles from moving around. MSF reported that some patients they saw could only reach a hospital after delays of 24 hours, due to barricades manned by gangs. Analysts say the upsurge in violence is also due to a growing dispute between the 400 Mawozo and G9 gangs, which intensified when the former invaded the latter’s territory. “Occupying more territory would have given them more leverage to negotiate electoral votes and access to more businesses that can be extorted for protection,” said Louis-Henri Mars, founder and executive director of local peace-building organisation Lakou Lapè. Haiti, the first black republic, has largely been plagued by violence, political instability and meddling from foreign powers since it bloodily won independence from French colonists two centuries ago. Today the scene is particularly bleak as gangs – often with the tacit support of political and business elites – continue to wage war on each other, the authorities and civilian populations. The country is still feeling the aftershocks of a string of overlapping crises last year. In July, President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in his hillside home. A month later a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti’s southern peninsula, killing more than 2,000 people and destroying tens of thousands of homes. A spate of kidnappings – of rich and poor alike – paralysed much of the capital last autumn, while the deportation of over 10,000 Haitians from the United States’ southern border to Port-au-Prince added to the instability. But the scenes in the capital, where murder, kidnapping and gun battles are a daily reality, have seldom been so bleak. “This is the worst violence-related crisis we have ever seen,” said Fiammetta Cappellini, country director for Italian aid group AVSI. “More and more areas of the capital – usually considered ‘safe’ – are now battlefields; thousands of people are fleeing their houses.” Violence in the Caribbean country looks unlikely to abate after the extradition of Joly “Yonyon” Germine, a leader of the 400 Mawozo gang, to the United States on Tuesday. Germine was charged in the US for involvement in the kidnapping of 17 members of an Ohio-based missionary organisation last October. Cappellini added that the international community had for too long ignored Haiti’s woes. “Something has to be done now,” the aid worker, based in Haiti for over a decade, said. “Before it’s too late and the country spirals into hell with no way back.”",News/Global development,‘Incredible cruelty’: gang battles leave 150 dead in Haitian capital,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/13/haiti-gang-battles-dead-wounded-displaced
5/13/2022,"Frances Poet has form when it comes to dramatising illness. Her play Fibres (2019) was about a shipyard worker and his wife living with asbestosis. The cast of ailing characters in Still (2021) included a woman with chronic pain. Maggie May, delayed from 2020 because of the pandemic, is about dementia. The writer plays a trick on us when it looks certain her focus will be on Tony Timberlake’s Gordon. He is the one snoring – well, snorting – in the bed after a blockage has caused a stroke. We assume he is in a bad way. Turns out he is fine. Timberlake plays him as genial and loving. He is as patient and forgiving as he is quick to burst into song. The subject is in fact our narrator, Maggie, who is resisting the news that her recent forgetfulness has not been caused by depression but by Alzheimer’s. Played superbly by Eithne Browne, she has a hard-nosed Yorkshire brusqueness, a hit-and-run wit and gallons of bottled-up passion. The Post-it notes covering the ceiling of Francis O’Connor’s set flutter down to guide her through the day. In a foggy mood, she can scarcely make sense of them. Poet is strong on the human stresses this creates. In moments of lucidity, Maggie can see the cruelty she inflicts on best friend Jo (Maxine Finch), the anger she rouses in her son Michael (Mark Holgate) and the confusion she causes to would-be daughter-in-law Claire (Shireen Farkhoy). In Jemima Levick’s uncluttered production, Poet plays on the power of memory both to define us and to nourish us. The thought of Maggie losing herself is alarming. That she will also lose the memory of her newborn baby’s skin is heartbreaking. All of this illustrates well the mixed emotional bag of bewilderment, humour and terror the condition provokes. But as with so many plays about illness, Maggie May presents no dilemma to be debated, just a condition to be experienced. In dramatic terms, Alzheimer’s has no resolution.

5/13/2022,"Elon Musk has said his $44bn (£36bn) takeover of Twitter is “temporarily on hold” after the social media platform claimed that less than 5% of its users were spam or fake accounts. The Tesla chief tweeted on Friday morning that the deal was being frozen while he awaited details supporting Twitter’s assertion, in a post that indicated scepticism at the claim. Musk announced the move alongside a link to a Reuters article published on 2 May that referred to a filing with the US financial regulator, in which Twitter claimed that false or spam accounts represented less than 5% of its daily average users. Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usershttps://t.co/Y2t0QMuuyn Musk has agreed to pay a $1bn break fee to Twitter if he walks away from the deal. The news sent Twitter’s shares down about 15% in pre-market trading to $38.21, on concerns that the deal could collapse. The agreed takeover values Twitter at $54.20 per share. However, a renowned US short-selling firm, which takes bets against companies’ share prices, said this week that Musk could submit a lower bid for Twitter, owing to a slump in tech stocks and a weak financial performance at the social media platform. Tesla shares were up nearly 6% in pre-market trading on Friday. Musk has railed at automated or “bot” Twitter accounts – which are not run by human users – and said after announcing the takeover that he wanted to improve the platform by “authenticating all humans”. Twitter allows automated accounts on its platform, ranging from disaster early warning systems to algorithmic art. In 2021, it introduced a new “automated account” label to publicly mark such accounts as being run by a computer, not a human. But those accounts need to follow strict rules and can lose access if they misbehave. One such automated account may even have been the driver for Musk’s initial purchase of Twitter stock. Created by a 19-year-old aviation enthusiast, the @elonjet Twitter feed tracks and automatically tweets the location of Elon Musk’s private plane, taken from public flight tracker data. In January, Musk offered the teenager $5,000 to buy the account and shut it down, declining the creator’s $50,000 counter-offer. A few days later, he began purchasing Twitter stock, filing his legal declaration that he own a substantial stake in early April. But declared automated accounts such as @elonjet are far outnumbered by spam accounts, which deliberately break Twitter’s terms of service in pursuit of commercial or political goals. Such accounts may use the reply function or direct messages to send adverts or scams to other users, or they may represent attempts to influence the public discourse by tweeting political propaganda. Other fake accounts exist purely to boost the metrics of individual users, who can buy followers, likes and retweets from “bot sellers” who control thousands or millions of fake accounts. “Bots massively multiply the ability of one person to attempt to manipulate people,” Samuel Woolley at Oxford University said after the launch of a report into social media manipulation in 2017. “Picture your annoying friend on Facebook, who’s always picking political fights. If they had an army of 5,000 bots, that would be a lot worse, right?”",News/Technology,"Twitter takeover temporarily on hold, says Elon Musk",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/13/twitter-takeover-temporarily-hold-elon-musk
5/13/2022,"The Queen is likely to perform more virtual engagements and any future official physical engagements will continue to be jointly diaried with other members of the royal family as part of ongoing adjustments due to her “episodic mobility problems”. While she will continue to perform her constitutional role as head of state, her role as head of nation, which is not part of her formal constitutional duties, is increasingly being shared among other senior royals. The state opening of parliament, at which she authorised Prince Charles and Prince William to deputise for her this week, is the only head of state engagement so far that she has been unable to fulfil in recent years as her age catches up with the 96-year-old monarch. But sources said she had no reason to relinquish more head of state duties, which as sovereign include the appointment of the prime minister, approval of parliamentary legislation, approval of official appointments and approval of secondary legislation as head of the privy council. The only one she has been forced to delegate, through the issuing of a letters patent, is the state opening because it requires a physical appearance. But all the others can be performed virtually if needed, and she has been doing this for some time now, according to insiders. On Wednesday she attended privy council virtually; she is still receiving government “red boxes” and greeting ambassadors virtually; and on Monday she received via video link the Australians of the year, introduced by the Australian governor general, David Hurley. Her diary as head of nation had definitely “flexed”, said one source. It is as head of nation that she makes her Christmas broadcast, sends messages of congratulation on national achievements, and sends messages of condolence at times of national, international and Commonwealth crisis. But several such events also include physical appearances, such as trooping the colour, Garter Day, Royal Ascot and garden parties, as well as visits to charities and patronages. She did appear at the Royal Windsor horse show on Friday to watch her animals take to the parade ring. The Queen has not carried out any investitures since the Covid pandemic began, except for that of Captain Sir Tom Moore, whom she knighted in a unique ceremony at Windsor Castle. Investitures are now regularly conducted by Prince Charles, Prince William and Princess Anne. It has already been announced she will not be attending this summer’s garden parties, and Prince Charles stood in for her at the first of this year’s on Wednesday. Charles had already stepped in to represent her at the traditional coin-giving ceremony known as the Maundy service, which she missed for the first time in April. Diaries between Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace have been and are being more closely coordinated than before to make sure another royal is at head of nation events if needed, so that if it is decided at the 11th hour the Queen will not attend, another royal will be there. While it is not yet known which events over the platinum jubilee weekend she will attend, it is hoped she will at least appear on Buckingham Palace balcony following trooping the colour on 2 June and at the St Paul’s Cathedral service of thanksgiving on 3 June. It is also hoped she will be at the Royal Windsor horse show’s jubilee “Gallop Through History” event on Sunday, which will reportedly feature 10 of her 12 great-grandchildren in horse-drawn carriages, including the Cambridges’ three children George, Charlotte and Louis.",News/UK news,Expect the Queen to perform more virtual duties as other royals step up,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/expect-queen-perform-more-virtual-duties-other-royals-step-up
5/13/2022,"In the aftermath of the leaked supreme court document fortelling the end to federal abortion protections, California geared up to fight. “California will not stand idly by”, the state’s governor and legislative leaders said in a joint statement. As in other liberal-leaning states, officials and abortion providers vowed to ramp up abortion protections and turn California into an abortion safe haven. Already, no other state does more to protect abortion access. The right to an abortion in California is guaranteed in statute and by the sweeping personal privacy rights enshrined in the state constitution. California health insurance plans cover the cost of an abortion for low-income residents, and the state has rejected waiting period requirements and most restrictions on the practice. But even in the state with the best abortion protections in the US, abortions have long been inaccessible for many – especially those living in rural, conservative areas. Forty percent of California counties have no clinics providing abortions. Many people still have to travel far to get the appropriate care, or struggle to afford abortions, while language barriers and a lack of up-to-date information can make it difficult to find help. Advocates say that the millions of dollars state leaders are promising for abortion care and extended legal protections are a start. But even more may be needed to care for those living within the state, and the thousands coming from afar. “As more and more people come in from out of state seeking abortions, it’s going to put more pressure on a system that’s already strained,” said Laura Jiménez, the executive director of California Latinas for Reproductive Justice. Across the country, blue states seeking to become abortion sanctuaries are facing similar challenges. Even as Democrat-controlled legislatures from coast to coast convey millions into abortion funds, advocates are unclear on just how much money and resources will be required by abortion clinics and services that are already overextended. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights group, about 43% of Massachusetts counties had no abortion clinics, and 13% of Massachusetts women lived in those counties. In Vermont, 64% counties had no clinics, and about 38% of Vermont women lived in those counties. Jennifer Lopez, who lives in Visalia in California’s agricultural Central Valley, had to drive north over county lines to get a simple medication abortion. (The Guardian is withholding her last name because she worries about backlash in her community.) “When you drive into Visalia from other parts of California, it’s like you’re going back in time,” said Lopez, 36. Visalia has a small Planned Parenthood clinic, but it doesn’t provide abortion care. An effort by Planned Parenthood to expand recently inspired furor among conservative groups, and a public hearing on the proposal to build a clinic that would provide abortions was postponed several times this year over the controversy. Lopez, who works at a domestic violence shelter, said she considers herself exceptionally lucky. Many of the clients she works with lack access to transportation or funding to travel for abortion care. “This isn’t a new problem,” said Jessica Pinckney, executive director of Access Reproductive Justice, an organisation that helps secure financing and organize travel, lodging and childcare for people seeking abortions. About a quarter of those seeking help from Access come from out-of-state, including from Texas, which enacted a near-total ban on abortions last year, Pinckney said. But the organisation has also helped many coming from states like Nevada – where abortion rights are protected, but clinics are sparse – and in remote regions within California. “We have helped folks in rural parts of northern California travel four or five hours to the Bay Area to access abortions,” Pinckney said, adding that the few abortion clinics in the rural regions are unable to care for patients with complicated abortions or those who are farther along in their pregnancies. Although a shortage of abortion clinics is felt most acutely in rural parts of California, people living in underserved parts of big cities can struggle to find care as well. Amelia Torres, 25, said she had to travel from the South Central neighbourhood of Los Angeles, where she lives, all the way across the city to Beverly Hills in order to get a surgical abortion. Torres, thinking she was about five weeks along when she found out she was pregnant, initially sought a medication abortion at a nearby clinic. But the medication didn’t work, she said. When she went in for a follow-up appointment, it turned out she was about 18 weeks along and would need a surgical abortion, which more than half of abortion clinics in the state aren’t equipped to perform. She didn’t have a car, but her partner was ultimately able to take time off work to drive her to the appointment, and her family was able to take care of her two daughters while she was being seen. “I was lucky,” she said. Though some in her family tried to dissuade her from terminating her pregnancy, they ultimately supported her choice. “But without that support, the money, the transportation,” she said, “even here in California getting an abortion can be very difficult.” In addition to a lack of providers, language barriers and a lack of information can make it impossible for many to find abortion care, or the resources to help fund such care. “There’s always been an enormous stigma around seeking information about abortions,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. Advocates in recent weeks have become increasingly concerned about the spread of misinformation that implies abortions aren’t legal in California. The fear of criminalization or deportation may also keep California immigrants who lack legal status or are in the country with a temporary protected status from seeking abortions or public resources to help pay for care, they say. Late-term abortions, once the fetus is viable, are still restricted in California and can be prosecuted, as can abortions performed outside a medical setting. “This might include a situation where there’s been rape and incest, and the person doesn’t realize that they are pregnant until much later in the pregnancy,” said Upadhyay. “These are extreme situations that apply only to a small number of patients.” California could also do more to protect those who miscarry, or attempt self abortions, advocates said. Just this week, a district attorney in California’s conservative Kings county dropped the prosecution of a woman who spent four years in prison for giving birth to a stillborn child after using drugs. “California is definitely a leader in passing legislation to protect people seeking abortions,” said Jiménez. “But there’s still some work to be done in the decriminalisation of self-managed abortions” And then there’s the cost. Even with insurance, Lopez had to pay about $550 out-of-pocket for each of the two abortions she sought over the past three years. “I managed to pay, but it was a big chunk out of my savings,” she said. The median out-of-pocket cost of a first-trimester for those without insurance in California is about $700. One resident of the Central Valley city of Dinuba, whom the Guardian is not naming because they fear stigma from their family, said they ended up paying about $1,000 for a first-trimester medication abortion last year because concerns about an ectopic pregnancy required them to seek multiple follow-up appointments. California recently passed legislation eliminating co-pays for abortion care, and the state already covers abortion costs for those enrolled in the state’s public insurance option for low-income residents. The governor this week announced an additional $57m to prepare for an influx of people from other states seeking abortions in California, including $40m for abortion providers offering care to low-income patients without health insurance, and $15m to help community-based organizations with sexual and reproductive health outreach and education. The funds “will go a long way” to protect abortion access “for those who live here and those who may be forced to seek care here”, said Jodi Hicks, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. Researchers and advocates say that telemedicine clinics, which consult with patients online and mail abortion pills to clients, could be another way to quickly expand abortion access. Telemedicine services typically charge about $300 for a simple service, and often don’t take public or private health insurance due to the logistical complications of securing reimbursements for care delivered across county lines, said Mai Fleming, a physician and researcher at UCSF who also works with an online abortion clinic. The services aren’t right for everyone and infeasible for many in rural California who lack internet access, but they still could be a solution for some who live in areas without clinics, she said. “Going forward, I think expanding telehealth could be key to expanding access in rural parts of the state,” she said, adding that California should work to make it easier for online clinics to accept insurance. Often, brick-and-mortar abortion clinics shy away from offering telehealth abortion services precisely because of how insurance reimbursements work. Public and private insurance services reimburse at higher rates for in-person appointments that include an ultrasound, which is often medically unnecessary – leading clinics to require patients to come in person in order to recoup operational costs, Upadhyay said. In an attempt to ramp up the number of healthcare workers available to perform abortions, California and some other states are also moving to allow nurse practitioners to provide abortion care without the supervision of a physician. And ultimately, more primary care providers and family clinics could start providing abortion care, Fleming said – though as it stands, primary care and family medicine residencies still aren’t required to train doctors to provide abortion care. “Despite its very progressive laws, hurdles and barriers to abortion care have existed for years,” she said. But now, especially, she added, “it’s important to remember that abortion, legality, abortion rights, don’t necessarily equal abortion justice or abortion access.”",News/US news,Even in abortion ‘safe havens’ finding care can be challenging,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/13/abortion-access-safe-haven-california
5/13/2022,"As a source of dating advice, Kevin Samuels would seem a last resort for America’s Black women. On his YouTube show and podcasts, Samuels criticized Black women for being old and out of shape, and for having children out of wedlock. He sneered at “modern women” who flaunted their multiple college degrees and boasted of their independence. He dropped these bombs in the softest voice, in a tailored suit, and bathed in mood lighting with a funky kinetic energy sculpture on his desk. Yet many women not only tuned in to Samuels in droves, they cued up to Zoom into his show – some in hopes of putting the self-made image consultant turned relationship expert in his place. When Samuels suddenly died last Thursday in Atlanta at 57, as his star was still rising (the Fulton county medical examiners office has not yet revealed a cause of death), his many detractors reacted like Munchkins at the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East. The overwhelming lack of sympathy for Samuels – whose mother reportedly found out about his death as speculation raged online – comes down to his profiting from dismissing single Black women over 35 as “leftovers” whose unrealistic desire for “high-value men” would doom them to a lonely death. On a recent episode of the Fox Soul streaming show Cocktails with Queens, the actor Vivica A Fox called Samuels’ death karma payback. “This man was a hypocrite, in my honest opinion,” she said. “He insulted African American women on a consistent basis.” In a Mother’s Day sermon, the preacher-influencer Jamal Bryant indirectly singled out this “high-powered man” for allegedly needing “a GoFundMe for his funeral”. The many women in Bryant’s congregation ate this up. Still, just as many Black celebrities have rushed to defend Samuels. “Love him or hate him,” said the actor Marlon Wayans, “he spoke his truth. If you hated [him] why tune in?” The rapper turned comedian TI scorned the gleeful reactions to his death as a “fucking travesty” while branding Samuels’ haters as “despicable” and “bullies”. “Whatever he did, he did it, and [he’s] gone,” said the Why You Wanna emcee. “He got away with it.” Besides his mother and daughter, Samuels is survived by his legion followers in the online community known as the “manosphere”, a sort of digital bathhouse for naked pushback against feminist ideology and the reprisal of traditional gender norms. Casually drawing on relationship and income statistics, Samuels delighted in playing the role of market adjuster and scolding “average” Black women for pursuing Black men in the Talented Tenth – good-looking men with minimum six-figure incomes, no kids, no priors, and no hangups in bed. According to Samuels, guys mainly wanted women who were “fit, feminine, friendly, cooperative and submissive”. He barely had patience for callers who defied that description, and regularly played those clashes with them for laughs. And this was against the backdrop of Black women having a tough enough time being taken seriously online, let alone settling down. More than 30,000 people signed an online petition calling on YouTube and Instagram to de-platform Samuels, believing he had “galvanised a community of men of all races and nationalities in the outspoken hatred of women”. To many, Samuel’s polished and bespectacled presentation was little more than a pseudo-intellectual cover for misogynoir. “I think he has had an outsized impact on poisoning the social discourse between Black men and Black women around matters of love, dating and intimacy,” the Rutgers women’s studies professor Brittney Cooper wrote in a recent Facebook post, after Samuels used a clip of her talking about racism and fatphobia as an example of a low-value woman. “I hope that the Black women who liked Kevin’s work stop letting the latest brother with relationship advice exploit your pain.” Samuels’ public persona wasn’t always such a troll. A chemical engineering major who segued into a career in marketing, Samuels established himself on social media as a self-improvement coach and tastemaker (“the godfather of style”, he called himself), hipping men to the coolest clothes, watches and fragrances. But Samuels eventually saw the bigger audience for relationship content, and quickly distinguished himself by doubling down on the “negging” techniques that undergirded the pickup artist craze of the early aughts. It’s a blueprint that launched the mainstream success of Steve Harvey. Before he was widely known as the avuncular host of Family Feud and the Miss Universe pageant, Harvey was writing plainspoken relationship manuals for Black women and spinning them into the box-office topping Think Like a Man franchise. After one video sizing up a woman as “average at best” drew millions of views, Samuels was essentially rebooted as a relationship expert. In another oft-shared video he writes off a proudly curvy Black female caller as “running back-sized.” Before his death, Samuels had amassed more than 1.4 million YouTube subscribers and more than 1.2 million Instagram followers. Mainstream renown wasn’t much farther off. Already, Samuels was a fixture of the Black gossip blogs for his viral put-downs and for his interviews with Nicki Minaj, Future, and the social media influencer Brittany Renner. Those same blogs were quick to hypothesise about the chaotic circumstances of Samuels’ death and echo reports that the ultimate high-value man died broke. But his village of YouTube peers have rallied to debunk those rumours and rebuff what they characterise as efforts to defame Samuels in death. Mostly, they claim he was a tireless worker and shrewd businessman who could be harsh, but all in the interest of uplifting the community overall. In a YouTube eulogy, Melanie King, a Samuels protege who credits him for helping her rebuild from an agonising divorce, likened taking advice from him to “chewing broken glass”. “We needed that shock,” said King, who thought of Samuels more like a tough dad. “Because, let’s be honest, if he had not been so shocking to so many people, would you even know about him?”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Taking his advice was like ‘chewing broken glass’: the short life of dating guru Kevin Samuels,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/13/relationship-guru-kevin-samuels-life-death
