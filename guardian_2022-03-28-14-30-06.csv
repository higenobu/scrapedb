3/28/2022,"“Welcome to sunny Los Angeles: great for tans, shit for fans,” says ballsy businessman Jerry Buss (John C Reilly) to camera in this 10-part drama. It’s 1979, and he’s leaving the Playboy Mansion to go and buy the lacklustre LA Lakers basketball team. First on his to-do list: sign up college star Earvin “Magic” Johnson (Quincy Isaiah), much to the concern of his coach Jerry West (Jason Clarke). The Lakers are now one of sports’ most revered teams, and this series shows us that journey. Produced by Adam McKay, it’s a stylish and confident dive into a world riddled with elitism, racism and sexism – which also boasts some of the greatest sports stars in history.

Winners were instead announced on the Oscars Twitter account, then – in an even stranger move – celebrated in pre-recorded segments during the ceremony itself. The Oscars wanted more viewers so they cut a few categories. Then the majority of those categories were won by Dune, a critically and commercially successful blockbuster. Makes sense to me!! lmao that DUNE, a movie that made $400 million worldwide, is absolutely sweeping the awards no one will see bc abc wanted the show to be more ""populist"" If this year has taught us anything, it’s that the Oscars remains allergic to audiences’ real desires (to see awards) in favour of chasing clout (from Snyder stans).

3/28/2022,"If you’ve been watching any of the major American TV series recently, you may have noticed some new members in the cast. Some notable members. Some lower members. From the animatronic talking todger of Pam & Tommy to the bathroom bugle bared by Harry Goldenblatt in And Just Like That …, plus a whole panoply in the latest season of Euphoria, we seem to have entered a dust storm of dick. Despite having instances of full-frontal female nudity on screen since the experimental Dutch TV show Hoepla in 1967, the male equivalent seems to have lagged behind for several decades. This may have been partly caused by so-called obscenity laws, which prohibited the broadcast of an erect penis on national TV. Indeed, it wasn’t until August 2020 that British viewers got their first glimpse of an erection on telly, as part of Channel 4’s documentary Me and My Penis. British viewers have also been treated to glimpses of male nudity, even the odd nubbin, in a range of shows for many years – from War and Peace to Top Boy, from Misfits to Cucumber. Flaccid, yes. Fleeting, yes. But they were there. Back in 2014, Glyn Pritchard got memorably tasered in the tender parts in Channel 4’s Babylon. Pritchard’s character was caught in a police raid wearing nothing more than a T-shirt (what he laughingly calls a “crop top” when we chat). There were, the crew told him, various ways this could unfold. “They said I could do all the rehearsals, and all the other camera angles, with underpants on,” says Pritchard, who is due to perform in King Lear, in trousers, at London’s Globe this summer. “So I’d only be naked for that one shot. But that made it feel like it would be an occasion – building up to it. So instead, I tried to be naked as much as possible so we all got used to it and it was more comfortable.” Pritchard barks out a laugh. “Obviously, within reason. I wasn’t going for my lunch like that.” Perhaps what sets the recent American dongs apart is their idiosyncrasy. Even flaccid, the penis in And Just Like That … looked like a demi-baguette, while Pam & Tommy’s soliloquising sausage (inspired by Tommy Lee’s autobiography, in which the Mötley Crüe drummer chats to his penis) is more like something from the Muppet stable than a realistic appendage. Dear reader, it talks. But who are the people who make this magic happen? As a makeup and special effects artist, Matthew Mungle has been in this line of work for decades, creating quite an impressive number of prosthetic penises. His second job may have been applying Johnny Depp’s makeup every day of the Edward Scissorhands shoot, but he has hit on something of a specialism recently in making realistic, mobile or comic male genitals in everything from Will Ferrell’s Step Brothers to Little Britain USA and Shameless. “When I get an email or phone call from a producer or director saying they need a penis,” Mungle tells me, “my first questions are: is it cut or not cut, what’s the length and girth, how large are the testicles, and how long are the pubic hairs?” It sounds like a dating profile, I say. Mungle throws back his head in a great laugh. “You have to think about that stuff!” While he already has a range of soft moulds for various peckers, which can be customised or used off the peg, Mungle also makes bespoke penises for TV and film productions by sculpting a whole new structure out of oil-based clay. That’s right – shaft, testicles, scrotum and curlies, all coming together in one neat package that can be glued to the actor’s stomach. Well, as Mungle explains, it’s actually a bit more complicated than that: “There’s a flange at the top of the penis where the pubic hair is. I airbrush that with veins, different colours to make it look realistic. Then I have these pieces of hair lace I glue on. The bit at the very top of the flange is what gets glued to the actor’s own skin. That holds it on at the front. There’s also a piece of fabric that I glue on to the testicle area and, on set, that is pulled up between the buttocks and fastened at the top of the buttocks. It’s made of a sheer, nude-coloured power stretch material.” If this all sounds cumbersome, you may be surprised to hear quite how sentimental some actors get about their intimate additions. “I made the penis for Chris Hemsworth in Vacation,” Mungle tells me. “According to someone who worked on that movie, they put the, er, unit in an acrylic box and presented it to Chris at the end. Apparently, he was so proud of it, he had it on his mantle, right next to Thor’s hammer.” High praise indeed. As well as matching the colour of the actor’s skin, Mungle has to consider movement – and not just of the member. “The testicles I made for Step Brothers were quite specific,” he recalls, “because he pulled them out of his trousers and rubbed them on a drum kit.” You didn’t see the meat, just the two veg. “They had to move like free-floating testicles, rather than rigid miniature space hoppers. So I decided that we’d make actual testes that we put into a sack, which was very thin.” Ah yes, the scrotum. Tell us about it. “With plasticising silicone, you can make it as soft or as hard as you want,” Mungle explains, heroically stepping over the innuendo. “Using something called a deadener, you can make the material a little softer than a pencil eraser. Sometimes, for a scrotum, I do a firmer layer first then add a second over the top for the movement.” My eyes must have widened. “I’ve learned to be a chemist as well as an artist,” says Mungle, clapping his hands over his chest. “I’m a little Geppetto in my studio.” In real life, most penises come with their own set of inbuilt special effects: urination, erection, ejaculation. Yet these aren’t exactly a regular feature of television. Is that prudishness – or because of the technical difficulty? “I’ve never been called on to do a soft penis to an erect penis on screen,” says Mungle. “I’m sure that day will come. However, I worked with Matt Lucas and David Walliams on Little Britain USA and they had a sketch about two workout buddies. We had to sculpt whole body suits for them in latex: they come into the locker room, drop their towels and, well, they have extremely small penises.” This, I presume, is where most actors will be keen to point out that a prosthetic is needed. Mungle details how he transformed these flaccid members into erections off screen. “We worked a wire into each very small penis. When the time came, I had to go in, get down on my knees, take the little penis wire, pull it up then walk away.” He pauses. “I think there’s actually some video of me doing that.” Mungle hasn’t yet been asked to create an ejaculating penis, which would certainly feel like quite a step, given the still prevailing prudish attitudes to nudity. “With the way television is,” he says, “I’m not sure you’d get away with that. But I didn’t think they’d get away with showing this many penises!” Mungle worked on CSI not long after the infamous incident in which one of Janet Jackson’s breasts was exposed at the 2004 Super Bowl. “CBS,” he recalls, “came down and every time we did an autopsy of a female, you had to cover the breasts. It was ridiculous! You can pull out the heart, but not see their breasts.” In this context, why does there seem to have been such a ramping up of rampant male nudity in the last year? Are we genuinely experiencing a change in attitude? Perhaps the increase in visible male genitals is an attempt to counterbalance the sheer number of breasts that have been on TV for years, most notably in such shows as Game of Thrones. Or perhaps TV is finally just catching up with the much less prudish world of theatre. “As an actor,” says Pritchard, “going to do that scene that day, I was far more concerned with the performance than the fact everyone could see my willy. I’ve been naked on stage a couple of times. In fact, I did a play where all five of us were naked all the way through. After the first two minutes, the story takes over and it stops being a thing.”",Arts/Television & radio,Hollywood’s No 1 penis-maker: ‘Chris Hemsworth keeps his next to Thor’s hammer!’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/28/hollywoods-no-1-penis-maker-chris-hemsworth-thors-hammer-prosthetic-schlong
3/28/2022,"Hundreds of female professors working in UK higher education have joined forces to write to university bosses urging them to abandon planned cuts to pensions, arguing they will have a disproportionately damaging impact on female academics. More than 800 of the most senior women working in the sector have signed a letter that has been sent to Universities UK, the umbrella organisation representing higher education institutions, voicing their “deep concern” and calling for a last-minute rethink. Sweeping changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the UK’s largest private pension scheme, are due to be implemented from 1 April, despite having triggered repeated rounds of industrial action on campuses across the UK by members of the University and College Union (UCU). The letter points out that women are already adversely affected by the existing pensions scheme because of gender pay gaps at all career stages and because the scheme penalises those who have taken career breaks because of caring responsibilities. It warns, however, that the structure of the changes, which according to the UCU will cut 35% from a typical member’s guaranteed retirement income, will have “gendered impacts” that should be taken into account. “The cuts specifically to the defined benefit portion of the USS scheme – which provides guaranteed income for life – could disproportionately impact women because we generally spend more years in retirement,” the letter states. “Moreover, the sheer scale of the cuts would make the situation worse for future generations of women in academia, intensifying untenable trade-offs between early-career flexibility and the risk of financial precarity in old age.” The letter argues that the proposed reforms are based on a flawed valuation of the scheme done at the bottom of the market in March 2020. “The UUK should abandon the artificial April deadline, to allow time for a new valuation and comprehensive analysis of equity impacts,” it says. Pushing the changes through without due care for equity would show “a profound disregard for the wellbeing of women and members of other protected groups, undermining the commitment to equality, diversity, and inclusion,” the letter adds. Anne Pollock, a professor of global health and social medicine at King’s College London and one of the organisers of the letter, said: “It’s outrageous that our universities are planning to push through pension cuts on this scale without even bothering to do a full equity impact analysis. “If our universities want to claim that they support equity for women and other protected groups, they need to make sure that the impact of any cuts doesn’t fall disproportionately on the same groups that are already treated poorly by the scheme.” A UUK spokesperson insisted fairness, equality, diversity and inclusivity had been taken into account and said employers had conducted equality impact assessments on the changes, and also on the impact of the higher costs that otherwise would have been introduced. “Feedback from members and their representatives bodies in the recent consultation on the changes shows that affordability is a big concern, and particularly so for protected groups,” the spokesperson said. “USS will remain one of the most attractive pension schemes in the country.”",News/Education,Female professors call for rethink on planned UK pension cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/28/female-university-professors-call-for-rethink-on-planned-pension-cuts
3/28/2022,"Leo, the lion, is one of the zodiacal constellations. It is bordered to the east by Virgo, the virgin, and to the west by Cancer, the crab. Zodiacal constellations are defined as the 12 major star patterns through which the sun, the moon and the other planets all move throughout the year. They girdle the night sky and mark out the plane of our disc-shaped solar system. One of the oldest recognised constellations, with origins in Mesopotamian astronomical records dating to 4,000BC, Leo is a bright constellation that is easy to pick out at this time of year. The chart shows the view looking south-east from London at 2000 BST on 28 March 2022. It is straightforward to imagine a lion fitting into the constellation, with the head marked out by the sickle shape of stars. Regulus is the constellation’s brightest star. It shines with a blue-white light and represents the animal’s front leg. The second brightest star, Denebola, is similar in colour and sits at the rear of the constellation.

3/28/2022,"“Would he call his wife or his daughter a freak of nature?” wonders Nyakim Gatwech, the 29-year-old model targeted in a racism scandal that shook an Ivy League university. “His words are not just affecting me, but dark-skinned girls in general, dark-skinned girls who go to Columbia too or even a dark-skinned girl who is wishing to go there. It can affect her in a way that none of us can imagine – especially coming from a psychiatrist.” Jeffrey Lieberman has ranked among the US’s foremost clinicians for more than two decades. As the longtime chair of Columbia University’s psychiatry department, he was especially respected for his research and published discoveries about schizophrenia. But last month, the former president of the American Psychiatric Association became known for something else. Seemingly out of nowhere, Lieberman retweeted a photo of Gatwech and described her as a “freak of nature”; this was after the original post used the pronoun it in reference to the woman while making the false claim that she was listed in the Guinness book for having the world’s darkest skin. The fallout for Lieberman was swift. Within days he was suspended from his post at Columbia, stripped of his psychiatrist-in-chief position at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian hospital and asked to resign as director of the New York state psychiatric institute – a post that paid him almost $250,000. In addition to widespread condemnation online, Lieberman faced scorn from his many collaborators in New York’s elite medical community. “He’s a destructive personality who has done a great deal of damage, who is only now being held accountable after decades of impunity,’’ one former colleague told the City. In an email to university cohorts, Lieberman wrote: “An apology from me to the Black community, to women and to all of you is not enough.” Before his tweet and his Twitter account vanished, the model, Nyakim Gatwech, made sure to screenshot it for posterity. All her life, Gatwech has observed white people ogling her as if she were some kind of modern-day Hottentot Venus, an African female curiosity. But she hasn’t let the derisive comments deter her from pursuing a career as a fashion model, even as she risks being exposed to even more cutting prejudice in an industry famous for it. And while many industry stakeholders were quick to align themselves with the George Floyd-born antiracism movement while promising greater inclusion, Black fashion models still struggle to break through, much less earn their fair share. All the while, the same issues of cultural appropriation and racist gaffes remain. In her determination to join the ranks of Alek Wek, Duckie Thot and other world-renowned dark-skinned models, Gatwech makes her own breaks. For the better part of a decade, in between jobs as a Minneapolis daycare teacher and at a Buffalo, New York, Panera Bread, and while pursuing a degree in education, Gatwech collaborated with photographer friends to produce her own photoshoots, posting her favorite snaps to Instagram. It was through the following cultivated there that she came to be known as “queen of the dark” – a nickname that probably led to the Guinness book claim taking on a life of its own. The photo Lieberman retweeted, of Gatwech perched on a hotel bed mock-reading a newspaper, came from a shoot she hustled together two years ago. “Years back,” she says, “this thing would have really affected me.” Gatwech has lived a lifetime in her 29 years. Her mother fled war-torn South Sudan while pregnant; she was born at a refugee camp in Ethiopia and lived at another camp in Kenya for nine years before immigrating to Buffalo at age 16. On top of the ridicule she faced for not speaking English, the racist comments about her skin tone were relentless. “I would sit down in the classroom, and the students in front and behind me would get up and go, like I had some kind of disease or I smelled or my clothing wasn’t clean,” she recalls. “And some of these were other Black kids, to be quite frank with you. They were literally social distancing from me.” Some of the most uncomfortable moments, Gatwech recalls, came when the classroom lights went down for the projector; when she raised her hand, a classmate would think nothing of asking the teacher: “Can you even see her?” The bullying pushed Gatwech to consider suicide and weigh whether to bleach her skin – something her older sister was already doing. “She was like, ‘Here are the products, but it’s not going to solve anything,’” Gatwech recalls. “As you get older and into your career, there’s still gonna be people who say something about your skin color. You’ve got to work on loving yourself and not letting these people’s words affect you.” This article includes content provided by Instagram.

So they initiated a routine of daily affirmations and remembering the risks their mother took to bring them this far. And when the racist and colorist taunts finally became insufferable, the family pulled up stakes for the Minneapolis area, where they found instant community among the area’s east African expats. Once her self-confidence had recovered, Gatwech started to reconsider a career in modeling while binge-watching America’s Next Top Model after school. “When I saw Tyra Banks, I was like, ‘Wow, if she can do it, I can do it,’” she says. “But that was before I realized that my skin tone is not really accepted like that in this industry.” Her independent research into colorism sparked the idea for a shoot made up of Black women across the skin tone spectrum. But it was an outtake of her sitting next to a fair-skinned model during a set re-staging that properly launched her career and led to her booking work – not that it stopped her hustle. “For my first three big campaigns, I was the one pretending to be my manager,” says Gatwech. Unsure of what to charge for the work, she Googled possible rates. Still, the fact that model agencies hold fast to their blinkered views when it comes to rostering Black models is a continuing source of frustration. “When an agency already has that Sudanese dark-skinned model, they will just continue to work with her,” says Gatwech, who attended Black Lives Matter rallies in the Twin Cities after Floyd’s killing. “But that’s not diversity. Why can there only be one?” Gatwech’s social media ascent has continued, but she has yet to land a deal with a major modeling agency. “There hasn’t been an opportunity where a brand was like, ‘We want to put you on the cover of a magazine,’” says Gatwech, who splits time between New York and LA. “At least not yet.

3/28/2022,"Every few minutes, an ambulance or an unmarked white van arrives at a dusty courtyard on the western outskirts of Kyiv and an elderly, frail person is helped – or sometimes stretchered – from the back. These are some of the last residents of Irpin, a commuter town a few miles from Kyiv. They are those who were too old, too frail or too sick to leave earlier. Instead they have endured a month of hell as Russian forces pushed into the surrounding area during the first days of the war. The town has seen heavy fighting and has come under intense Russian bombardment. Volunteers hand out tea and sandwiches to the new arrivals, and those who are fit to travel arrange rides to relatives in the city or further afield. Others are stretchered into a makeshift medical tent and then transferred to hospitals or care homes. Not everyone makes it. On Friday a woman arrived with an open leg wound, apparently caused by a mortar attack. She died the next day in hospital. On Saturday afternoon a tiny woman who appeared to be well into her 90s sat shivering on a chair, wrapped in a green blanket and staring into the distance, shocked, confused and unable to speak. Tamara Osypchuk, 72, was a more lively evacuee, crying with joy as she was able to get through by phone to her daughter, who lives in Britain, for the first time in a week and inform her she was safe. “I live on the ninth floor and I have problems walking. Today is the first time I’ve been outside in three years,” she said, cloaked in a floor-length fur coat. While most remaining Irpin residents now sleep in basements, she had spent the past month in her apartment, wondering if each explosion would be her last. “The noise outside was incredible. All the time: bam, bam, bam,” she said, shouting at the top of her voice to indicate the noise. The opposite corner of her apartment building was blown off, but her flat somehow remained unscathed. She said frequent prayer had stopped her from panicking. “You have to look death in the eyes and not be scared. You should live as a human being, and leave this earth as a human being, with dignity. I wasn’t going to sit in any basement,” she said. Irpin was one of a number of towns west of Kyiv the Russians pushed towards after landing forces at the nearby Hostomel airbase in the first few days of the invasion. However, Russia’s plans to encircle or seize Kyiv quickly became bogged down in fighting. Ukrainian forces now claim to control 80% of the territory of Irpin, and to be close to encircling Russian troops in the wider area. Heavy fighting continues. Since early March there has been no gas, water or electricity in Irpin, and almost no medicine. Ukrainian forces blew up the bridge linking Irpin to Kyiv early in the war, to halt the Russian advance on the capital, meaning residents could only leave by crossing on foot across the ruins, which are strewn with abandoned, destroyed vehicles and still come under frequent Russian fire. For Oleksiy Ignatenkov, a 41-year-old businessman who coordinates a group of volunteers helping with evacuations from Irpin, the refusal of some residents to leave is infuriating. “We sometimes go to the same places again and again and beg them, but they won’t go,” he said, looking harried and exhausted. Evacuations have to be coordinated so that volunteers or soldiers in Irpin bring the residents to the bridge, carry them across, and are then met by more volunteers on the other side, who drive them a few minutes to the outskirts of Kyiv, where the booms in the distance are a constant reminder of what is happening in Irpin. “The evacuation route comes under mortar fire two or three times a day. It’s like playing Russian roulette every time,” said Ignatenkov. On Thursday two volunteers died during an evacuation attempt, he said, showing on his phone a video of the car after the attack, scarlet pools of blood in the front seats. He asked not to name the victims. Alexander Kolomiets, a 27-year-old trainee paediatrician who performs standup comedy in his spare time, was one of the few young people to remain in Irpin after the first week of fighting. He described a month of close shaves and near misses. “One morning I was getting water from the well and suddenly I heard noises, and I just jumped into the well and grabbed on to the sides with my arms and legs, like Spider-Man. I don’t know how I did it but it saved my life as there was shrapnel flying everywhere,” he said. He tried to feed as many pets as he could. “I was dashing into abandoned apartments where pets remained when there were gaps in the shelling, to quickly feed them,” he said. One house was hit half an hour after he left; another building took a direct hit just before he arrived. In one location he left the attic to look for a cat downstairs, and seconds later a shell hit the roof, destroying the upper floor. It is not just the shelling that kills, it is also the nervous tension. “I saw old people fighting over bread. Everyone was so on edge. Humour is important in these situations. I stayed to try to cheer people up, I tried to joke with people, and calm them down,” Kolomiets said. But late one night he heard the terrified screams of an elderly woman. When dawn broke he discovered it had been the grandmother of his childhood friend: her husband had dropped dead from a heart attack, apparently unable to cope with the misery all around. “We buried him in the courtyard that morning. Can you imagine that? Burying, with your own hands, in your own courtyard, someone you’ve known all your life,” he said. Another of the weekend’s evacuees from Irpin with enough energy to speak about the ordeal was 45-year-old Svitlana Rohutska, who runs an online construction business and also breeds Schnauzer puppies. She remained in Irpin because she did not want to abandon her dogs. “I couldn’t leave the puppies. There are big dogs left behind, and they’re all starving and forming packs. They would have eaten my babies,” she said. She had spent the past month in a basement together with six other people. They had plenty of food but the constant shelling and the poor sanitary conditions became unbearable. “We were becoming hysterical. Everyone was screaming at each other. Yesterday one of the others died; he either had a blood clot or it was coronavirus, we don’t know. He just died right there. I realised I had to get out. I need to wash, I need a doctor, I need to see a psychologist,” she said. She crossed the bridge carrying four of her dogs and a cat, and with seven puppies stuffed into a suitcase. While underground, Rohutska heard Russian soldiers passing on the street above, apparently on the hunt for food and supplies, she said. Another Irpin resident shared photographs taken in the town on 12 March, appearing to show Russian soldiers entering private property, and claimed they had been looting local houses. “Those orcs were taking anything they could get their hands on,” she said. While most people who have left Irpin are relieved to have reached the relative safety of Kyiv, Kolomiets said he planned to return on Monday in an attempt to persuade more people to leave. “The people who are left now are the people who really can’t walk: drug addicts, alcoholics and the really old pensioners. These are the people we have to take the most care of,” he said.",News/World news,Escape from Irpin: frail residents helped to safety after month of hell,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/escape-from-irpin-frail-residents-helped-to-safety-after-month-of-hell
3/28/2022,"Millions of households are paying an extra £170 in bills because of cuts to subsidies for measures such as home insulation, according to analysis that comes during an impasse on the government’s energy strategy. One cabinet source said it was now likely the strategy – designed to tackle rising bills and boost energy security – would not be ready this week, amid cabinet splits over funding for nuclear power and the relaxing of planning rules concerning onshore wind. On Sunday one cabinet minister suggested the government was looking seriously at schemes to offer homeowners discounts on energy if they live near new windfarms or nuclear plants. “We’ve seen great examples of other people where if they build a nuclear power station, within a certain radius of that power station they get free power,” said the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi. Campaigners have said the strategy should include further measures to make homes more energy efficient, on top of the announcement last week that VAT would be cut on materials used for measures such as the installation of solar panels and heat pumps. Analysis highlighted by Labour found a fall in home insulation rates since 2012, when many subsidies were cut, meaning that at least 9 million households were now paying £170 a year more in electricity bills. The party has called for a national homes insulation programme, which the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said would reduce energy consumption enough to nullify the amount of gas imported from Russia. Installations averaged 40,000 a month in 2012 under the previous government’s insulation programmes, the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) and the community energy saving programme (CESP). But these ended at the end of 2012 and were replaced by other schemes, including a loan system that had low take-up. The analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit suggests insulation rates subsequently fell by 92%. An additional 9 million households would be likely to have benefited from the energy-saving measures had they continued at pre-2012 levels. Labour has pledged £60bn of public investment to bring all homes up to the energy performance certificate (EPC) band C rating over 10 years, claiming it would save each family £400 a year on their energy bills and cut national gas imports by up to 15%. The average E-rated home is set to require an additional £320 a year for energy bills compared with a C-rated property. “The chancellor’s disastrous spring statement is unraveling because he failed to tackle the cost of living crisis that working people face,” Miliband said. “The government’s energy relaunch will have no credibility unless it finally delivers on energy efficiency – the best, most effective way to reduce energy bills, cut our demand for fossil fuels and bring down carbon emissions.” Sunak is expected to come under fire at the Treasury select committee hearing on Monday after a furious response to the spring statement, widely seen as not doing enough to ease the cost of living crisis. Johnson is expected to try to reconcile senior cabinet ministers this week amid fallout from the spring statement, and to resolve tensions over the energy strategy. A government source confirmed reports in the Sunday Times that Downing Street was looking at preliminary proposals for a new council tax rebate in the autumn, with consumers facing the possibility of further fuel bill rises in October. On Friday the energy price cap will rise by almost £700 to £1,971 – and it could rise to about £2,500 by October 2022 for the average dual fuel bill. Meanwhile, Zahawi hinted that the government could do more to help with the cost of living crisis. “I think he [Rishi Sunak, the chancellor] will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right,” he said. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say ‘job done’. But I think £22bn, in one year, of help when you’ve just spent £400bn is the right thing to do.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Sunak had been “playing games” by announcing a future 1p cut to income tax in the statement while people were struggling this year. “Rishi Sunak absolutely had more room for manoeuvre in this spring statement and mini budget, but rather than acting in the interests of the British people, he was playing games,” Ashworth said. “He was acting in his own interest because he thinks by offering an income tax cut in two years, that’ll help him politically with Conservative MPs if there’s a leadership contest or that’ll fit the Tory election grid.” As well as a major expansion in energy efficiency measures, Labour has called for the chancellor to cut VAT on energy bills and to impose a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies, as well as cancelling the planned rise in national insurance from April.",News/Environment,Millions of households pay £170 more for energy due to Tory subsidy cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/millions-of-households-pay-170-more-for-energy-due-to-tory-subsidy-cuts
3/28/2022,"Lawyers and campaigners have called on the government to take urgent action to help thousands of Ukrainian seasonal farm workers who were in the UK when the war started and have been left at risk of destitution, abuse and exploitation here. Ukrainians made up by far the largest proportion of workers in the UK on seasonal worker visas in 2021. Of the 29,631 visas issued under the T5 seasonal work scheme, 19,920 – 67% – were given to Ukrainians. The Scottish Refugee Council estimates that there are up to 6,000 in the UK. While the government has announced two schemes to allow Ukrainians to come to the UK – the family visa scheme and the community sponsorship scheme – Ukrainian farm workers who are here on six-month visas do not qualify for either. The Home Office has extended the seasonal farm worker visas until the end of 2024 but workers are tied to their employer, cannot seek alternative work outside the farming sector and have no recourse to public funds. They do not have the right to bring family members to the UK from Ukraine. Graham O’Neill, the policy manager at the Scottish Refugee Council, is calling for this group of temporary workers to be immediately moved on to the Ukraine family scheme, which has more rights attached to it. “We regard the UK government’s lack of action … at this traumatic time as a scandal in plain sight,” he said. Focus On Labour Exploitation (Flex) and other organisations have written to the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the immigration minister Kevin Foster raising concerns about the plight of Ukrainian farm workers and calling on government to make policy concessions in order to safeguard them. Lucila Granada, the chief executive of Flex, said: “We want to see the safety and wellbeing of this group of Ukrainian workers prioritised. They should be given permission to work outside the agricultural sector and they should be given recourse to public funds.” Jennifer Blair, a barrister and co-founder of the Ukraine Advice Project, said that about 1,000 Ukrainians had sought legal advice from them, including many farm workers. She said this group had been “particularly badly impacted”. James Seddon, a Lancashire leek farmer, said he had four Ukrainians working for him – couples who were desperate to bring their children to the UK but were unable to do so. “We will do anything we possibly can to try to help,” he said. “For Ukrainians currently here on farm worker visas the amount of work they have access to depends on the kind of farm they are working on. Those where farms cannot supply them continuous work because of the kind of crops grown are particularly struggling.” Poor working conditions and exploitation among seasonal farm workers is well documented. Earlier this month, the Work Rights Centre published a report about exploitation of farm workers in the UK on seasonal work visas. Many of the workers facing exploitation on farms are Ukrainian. One of the Ukrainian farm workers they are supporting, Oksana (no her real name), an IT worker in Ukraine, obtained a visa to come to the UK in August 2021 for a few months to earn some money, with her partner, a medical student. They were given work on a berry farm but were exploited and given work only intermittently. They complained about the exploitation but nothing was done so they left the farm and are living undocumented, working without permission in cleaning and construction respectively. The Home Office does not allow applications to the family or community sponsor visa schemes from within the UK so the couple are stuck. Oksana said she was “lost and torn” between staying undocumented in the UK or returning to Ukraine to help fight. The Home Office declined to comment on the visa situation for Ukrainian workers. A government spokesperson said: “We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing horrific persecution in Ukraine can find safety in the UK, setting up both the Ukraine family scheme and now the homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows those without family connections to come here.”",News/Environment,‘Scandal in plain sight’: charities call for help for Ukrainian seasonal workers,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/scandal-in-plain-sight-charities-call-for-help-for-ukrainian-seasonal-workers
3/28/2022,"If you are reading this, it means that I have just become a mother. For reasons of practicality, and superstition, I am writing this column in advance. I am currently 29 weeks pregnant, just into my third trimester, but this will not run until, all being well, my baby is born. Born, too – hopefully less painfully – is this series, The Republic of Parenthood, which will hopefully speak to other parents, and examine some of the philosophical, political and cultural issues around modern parenthood. I chose the name to honour The Republic of Motherhood, a beautiful poem by Liz Berry that evokes the feeling of which many new mothers speak; of joining a new society, almost, which feels like a closed-off state separate from the rest of the world, one that necessitates the learning of new rules and customs: “I stood with my sisters in the queues of Motherhood –the weighing clinic, the supermarket – waitingfor Motherhood’s bureaucracies to open their doors.As required, I stood beneath the flag of Motherhoodand opened my mouth although I did not know the anthem.” For Berry, the Republic of Motherhood is “a wild queendom”, and, though I feel her words deeply, I wanted this series to include fathers, and families of all shapes and sizes. Hence: parenthood. I also chose the name semi-ironically, for though parenthood may feel like a separate state to some, we are all, ultimately, part of a collective, a community. It seems to be that problems arise when we fail to acknowledge the role parents play in that and – vice versa – the part played by those who are childless and child-free (two slightly different things, as I will come to explore). So I hope this series speaks, too, to non-parents, and helps to foster solidarity between us all, whatever our choices. It is easy to say that everything about pregnancy and motherhood has been written already, and certainly I am joining a crowded field. Accordingly, I promise not to write as though I am the first woman to ever have given birth to a child, nor can I really profess to know anything. I can be honest, but I cannot be didactic, because I am a complete novice. This is all also sounding rather earnest, so I also promise not to take myself too seriously. So much writing about parenthood feels to me to be po-faced, moralistic in tone, painfully middle-class and passé. Very little of it seems to speak to parents of my generation and younger, who face unique struggles in addition to all the usual challenges, during an unprecedented societal moment and with a moral panic about the birthrate humming in the background. For example, last night I read a couple of newspaper articles that talked about home decoration for parents. Both assumed that everyone lives in a giant Victorian terrace, recommending lethally expensive furniture and accessories – cot canopies costing more than £100, a smart cot that “sleep-trains” your baby, retailing at more than a grand – and featuring quotes from influencers and mummy bloggers. As someone who lives in a rented flat and, with the best will in the world, has zero interest in following these women, I thought there might be some writing out there that spoke to me during my pregnancy. But there was very little. And there must be others like me, who are spending their days in a state of near constant bemusement and frustration. Instead, I have turned to older female writers, to Rachel Cusk, Anne Enright, Maggie O’Farrell, Rebecca Walker, Adrienne Rich, Elena Ferrante and Audre Lorde, for inspiration. It’s been a strange time to be pregnant: in the middle of a pandemic, though at a stage, thankfully, when vaccines have been available. It has meant that, while others have returned to an approximation of normal life, those who are pregnant and their partners are still living in varying degrees of lockdown. Even when we’ve had the jab, the advice is to be extra careful, and no one wants to risk their baby’s health or, should their partner catch Covid, being unable to be present at the birth. I have been lucky to have a pregnancy that has mostly been happy and healthy, but at times it has also felt curiously lonely. Reading and writing about it has helped, and I hope will continue to do so. When I showed my mother the poem The Republic of Motherhood, she praised it, but she also said: “It isn’t like this, you know, for everyone.” It was my first glimpse of a gulf between those who have struggled in parenthood, and those who have thrived. I have friends in both camps, and at this stage have no idea where I will fall: perhaps, like many people, somewhere in between. This is why it is important to stress that I do not believe my experience to be that of anyone else, and the purpose of this column is not to alienate, but to include. Our experiences may all be different, but we have much in common, whether we are parents or are contemplating parenthood, or have decided against it, or crave it desperately only to be thwarted. Wherever you fall, I hope this column speaks to you. And I hereby promise that I will never subject you to a single anecdote about changing my baby’s nappy. Well, not unless it’s really, really funny. What’s working: As I write this, I have not slept through the night for seven weeks (so much for “sleep while you can”), mostly because I simply cannot get comfortable. I have tried shoring myself up with piles and piles of feather pillows, but the only thing that seems to truly give my aching hips and back some relief is a pregnancy pillow (mine is from BellaMoon, and is like a giant, squishy croissant that you straddle, supporting you to sleep on your side). It isn’t cheap and takes up roughly the same space in the bed as a person, but, if it saves my aching back, I’m a convert. What isn’t: My friend recommended I tried hypnobirthing, but many of the “positive birth stories” are along the following lines: “During my home birth, I was bleeding out all over the living room floor. The midwife recommended that I go to hospital, but, using what I learned in hypnobirthing, I resisted all attempts at medical intervention.” Some may find these stories comforting: I really, really don’t.

3/28/2022,"Russian and Ukrainian negotiators will resume face-to-face talks as soon as Monday, as Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed the forthcoming new negotiations, saying he hoped they would bring peace “without delay”. The new talks are set to start in Turkey on either Monday or Tuesday, with Zelenskiy desperate to halt the bombardment of cities such as Mariupol, where officials said the situation is “catastrophic”. “Our goal is obvious – peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible,” Zelensky said in a late-night video message that also set out his negotiating red lines. “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory,” he said. The efforts at peace came as Joe Biden tried to limit the fallout from his controversial statement at the weekend that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”. When asked on Sunday if he wanted to see Putin removed from office in Russia he said simply “no”. The president’s original comments were swiftly walked back by both the White House and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who insisted the US did not have “a strategy of regime change in Russia – or anywhere else”. The UK, Germany and France also distanced themselves from Biden’s apparently unplanned remark. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that he would not have used Biden’s words, adding that he saw his task as “achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops by diplomatic means”. He told broadcaster France 3: “If we want to do that, we can’t escalate in either words or actions.” In his video address, Zelenskiy lamented a month-long Russian invasion that has killed thousands and devastated numerous cities, amid questions as to whether a near-stalemate in fighting has forced Moscow to temper its demands. The Ukrainian military claimed in its latest operational report that Russia had withdrawn troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses. Meanwhile, the UK Ministry of Defence said Moscow was “effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade” with its blockade in the Black Sea and continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets across Ukraine. The Ukrainian president used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss the idea of Ukraine adopting a “neutral status”, and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. But he said he was not willing to discuss demilitarisation, and that Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. Concerns remain about Russia’s sincerity in the talks, with Ukraine intelligence chief Gen Kyrylo Budanov suggesting Putin is seeking to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea. Budanov said he believed Putin had rethought his plan for full occupation since failing to swiftly take Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and overthrow Zelenskiy’s government, raising the prospect of a long conflict. About 170,000 civilians remain trapped in Mariupol without adequate food, water or medicine, as the southern port city is being turned “into dust” by Russian shelling, according to Ukraine’s foreign ministry. Zelenskiy claimed that 2,000 children from Mariupol have been taken by Russia, according to a press release published by the president’s office late on Sunday. “According to our data, more than 2,000 children were deported. Which means they were abducted. Because we do not know the exact locations of all these children. There were children with and without parents. It’s a catastrophe, it’s horrible.” Zelenskiy said the city remained blocked by the Russian military, describing the situation as a humanitarian catastrophe. “Food, medicine, and water can’t be delivered. The Russian troops are shelling humanitarian convoys and killing drivers.” France, Greece and Turkey are hoping to launch a “humanitarian operation” to evacuate civilians within days, according to Macron, who has sought approval from Putin. In other developments: The UN estimates that at least 1,100 civilians have died and more than 10 million have been displaced in a devastating war that has gone on far longer than Moscow expected. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks in an update to her Telegram account. Hollywood A-listers noted the toll on civilians with a moment of silence at Sunday’s Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles, urging support for “the people of Ukraine currently facing invasion, conflict and prejudice within their own borders”.",News/World news,Zelenskiy hails upcoming Ukraine-Russia peace talks amid fallout from Biden comments on Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/zelenskiy-hails-upcoming-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-amid-fallout-from-biden-comments-on-putin
3/28/2022,"You could not have asked for a better illustration of the resilience and willingness to rise to the occasion that has defined Melbourne Victory’s unlikely journey to back-to-back A-League Women’s titles. In the 76th minute of Victory’s smash-and-grab win over Sydney FC in Sunday’s grand final, Charlize Rule launched herself at another Sydney corner. The teenager could not find the equaliser, but she did find Casey Dumont: crashing into the Victory goalkeeper’s ribs and sending her crashing to the turf. Trainers immediately rushed onto the field and on the sideline, back-up goalkeeper Melissa Maizels sprung to her feet. Despite working to come into the season in the best shape of her life, that Dumont was even out there at that point was a minor miracle. Following a 3-1 loss to Adelaide a month prior she was taken to hospital with a suspected broken leg – only to start eight days later. She spent much of the week preceding Sunday’s final bed-bound with illness. Further, Maizels had already been roused from the bench on a number of occasions as Dumont struggled to continue. But now, with Sydney throwing themselves at Victory with every drop of vile and venom in their veins, her day appeared over. So impressive was her performance to that point, Victory’s title hopes, despite them still holding onto the lead, felt as if they would leave with her. Yet, much as her team has done throughout this season, Dumont persisted. “I wasn’t worried because I knew she’d get up,” Victory boss Jeff Hopkins said post-game. Indeed, nearly an hour later, Dumont sat alongside a coach who has believed in her more than most in her footballing journey as a player of the game and a champion. Unrestrained happiness radiated off her; agony and uncontainable joy from a player who refused to be cowed. A more fitting encapsulation of Victory’s season could not be written. They were underdogs on Sunday. They were on the road. Sydney were rolling. But they won anyway. They won despite losing their captain, on-field bedrock and irreplaceable leader Kayla Morrison to an ACL less than 45 minutes into the campaign. After Covid ripped through their ranks. In the face of a fixture that forced their semi-professional players to play seven games in 23 days. In spite of limping into the finals on goal difference. Nonetheless, once said finals began, this team found a way. A group of players that had been there before and got the (championship winner) T-shirt stood up to be counted under the bright lights of finals football. Three times they went on the road (admittedly one was against Melbourne City) and three times they downed more favoured opposition. A dressing room culture in which its players demand excellence from each other while simultaneously being their own biggest supporter group found the right balance to succeed with no second chances. And a beloved coach, now the most successful in Australian women’s national league history, was there to help them believe, even when they didn’t. Jeff 👊 pic.twitter.com/8UAWG2eJUk Perhaps what makes Victory’s crown even more appropriate is that, allegorically, their season can be held up as a microcosm of the ALW’s, their triumphant conclusion able to provide operators the Australian Professional Leagues inspiration for the months ahead. Much like Victory, great things were expected from ALW at the commencement of 2021-22 and there was significant goodwill, only for things to go wrong pretty quickly. A combination of Covid and apocalyptic weather played havoc with the fixture, pushing players, coaches and supporters to their wit’s end. Demands that the league begin the process of professionalising and introducing a full home and away became furious and deafening. League-wide complaints surrounding the new broadcaster festered and continued angst surrounding the familiar bugbears of fan culture and doubleheaders lingered. Questions began to be asked if the momentum of 2023 was already being squandered. With the momentum of a stirring, and much-needed, finals campaign to work with, this is the landscape the APL will need to navigate in perhaps the biggest off-seasons in ALW history. Touting the improvements that will come from being able to stage a full season without Covid, APL managing director Danny Townsend has gone on the record saying that a roadmap to professionalism will be delivered this offseason and that further investment to capture the halo effect of the looming World Cup will be delivered. Clarification will also need to arrive, soon, on the status of Western United and Central Coast Mariners’ entry for 2022-23, which was announced as an intention at the start of 2021-22 but still yet to be officially confirmed. In the end, after one of the most challenging seasons ever, it was fitting that it was the side that turned resilience into an art form that won it all. The job of the APL is now to make sure nobody needs to win it that way again.",Sport/Football,Melbourne Victory’s character endures with Casey Dumont at its heart | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/a-league-women-melbourne-victorys-character-endured-with-casey-dumont-at-its-heart
3/28/2022,"It’s a long drag up the rutted lane from Ninebanks to Ouston Fell but, with sun clearing through the mist, it feels good to be up early and out walking. Peewits cry overhead, flying over the track on rounded wings, swooping and tumbling in exuberant displays. Among the flock a few curlews glide, uttering the double note that inspired their name, before erupting in full-throated bubbling. Larks rise up from the tufty hillside to trill with musical notes; we strain to spot them against sky and cloud. The moor is boggy after rain. We jump puddles and ditches, or flatten clumps of field rush to make mats to walk on. Spongy sphagnum mosses shine in vivid mounds of ruby and emerald. They can hold many times their own weight in water, slowing the flow and reducing flooding. Where a narrow sike runs down, several fist-sized white blobs stand out against the moorland green. I prod one and it feels gelatinous, like a congealed lump of wallpaper paste. It rocks and wobbles under my fingers, an alien strangeness in this barren landscape. No wonder people thought it fell from meteors and called it star jelly. The clue to its actual source is sticking out from one of the white lumps. A bloated frog, stomach stretched into a mottled ball, legs shrunken and mummified, fine pointed toes on an elongated foot. This was a female frog, spewed out by a predator – perhaps the buzzard I’d heard calling earlier. If the mucus of a frog’s spawn swells in the predator’s stomach, it may be regurgitated, expanding further on contact with the rain and the wet ground. A second frog lies close by. It’s not surprising that myths and stories surround this weird and rare substance. In the 14th century, the English physician John of Gaddesden named it stella terrae, “a certain mucilaginous substance lying upon the earth”. Even now, the internet is full of theories – and it does feel otherworldly. I had read about star jelly but this was the first time I’d encountered it. Without seeing the dead frogs, it might have been easy to imagine that it came from some mysterious place.
