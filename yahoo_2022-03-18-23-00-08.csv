3/18/2022,"When an aging Abe Osheroff recalled why, as a 21-year-old kid from Brooklyn’s Brownsville neighborhood, he had volunteered to join the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War in 1936, he framed it as a personal, ethical decision. “Some of my friends were already going over. Some of them had been killed and wounded. … Then I began to see pictures of what was going on. … Bombardments, civilians getting plastered all over the place. … I knew that if I didn’t go, I’d be ashamed all my life.” Today, his words seem to echo those of individuals from around the world who are willing to risk their lives to help Ukraine in its desperate struggle against the Russian invasion. “Sitting by and doing nothing? I had to do that when Afghanistan fell apart, and it weighed heavily on me. I had to act,” a U.S. veteran confessed to a New York Times reporter before he headed east. Encouraged by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, volunteers are signing up – according to some reports, by the thousands – to join the ranks of what The Guardian has called “the most significant international brigade since the Spanish civil war.” The Guardian is not the first to draw an analogy between 1930s Spain and today’s Ukraine. But tempting as it is to compare the two, doing so does more to obscure than to explain either of the conflicts. In some instances, I see the analogy relying on distorted frames inherited from the Cold War; in others, it seems to be driven by blatant opportunism. The Spanish Civil War broke out in the summer of 1936 after an attempted military coup, led by Gen. Francisco Franco, failed to overthrow the government of the Popular Front, a liberal-progressive coalition that had been democratically elected to lead the Second Spanish Republic. But while the Republican government managed to hold on to Spain’s largest cities and about half of the national territory, the right-wing rebels took control of the other half. They proceeded to wage a bloody war. Republican forces faced a well-equipped rebel army that Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy had supplied with soldiers, planes, weapons and tanks. By contrast, other democracies left the republic to fend for itself, with more than two dozen countries signing a nonintervention pact. The republic was also shut out of the international arms market, leaving only the Soviet Union and Mexico as sources of military support. After the republic’s defeat in 1939, a repressive military dictatorship headed by Franco ruled Spain for the next 36 years. Osheroff was one of roughly 2,800 U.S. volunteers – and more than 35,000 from around the world – who flocked to Spain to help fight fascism. These foreign fighters were largely recruited through communist organizations, although many were not communists. What they had in common was their staunch opposition to everything fascism stood for. Upon arriving in Spain, the volunteers became fully integrated members of the Spanish Republican Army, where most of them served in one of five International Brigades. As a scholar of the Spanish Civil War and its legacy, I can see why many people would be tempted to read the war in Ukraine through a Spanish lens. Much as in civil war Spain, Ukrainian cities are being bombarded and civilians are dying, while those attacked are putting up an unexpectedly persistent defense against a much stronger enemy. As in Spain, the war is producing seemingly unending streams of refugees. And, as in Spain, the war seems to reflect an unusual degree of moral clarity – “It’s a conflict that has a clear good and bad side,” one U.S. veteran told The New York Times – while the fate of the world seems to hang in the balance. Yet historical analogies are never perfect, rarely useful and often misleading. For one thing, the geopolitics of today has little connection to the 1930s. In 1936 there was no NATO, only a weak and ineffectual League of Nations, and no threat of nuclear war. Furthermore, the volunteers who joined the International Brigades in 1936 from Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Asia had little in common with the combat veterans and Ukrainian nationalists who are signing up today, and whose politics, as NPR has reported, are vague and may skew to the right or far right. While the Russian invasion clearly violates Ukrainian sovereignty, those defending Ukraine represent ideologies that cover the entire political spectrum. By contrast, very few of the volunteers in Spain had military training or experience. And if Osheroff knew that the Spanish war was also his to fight, it was, as he explained, because he’d grown up steeped in progressive politics. He and his fellow brigaders were driven by the internationalist solidarity that’s the bedrock of the labor movement, but they also knew they had a personal stake in the struggle. Many of them were Jews and immigrants; they belonged to a generation that, as the historian Helen Graham has written, was resisting “attempts, by fascism, either alone or in coalition, violently to impose ethnic and class hierarchies both old and new across the whole continent.” The analogy falters in other ways as well. The half-million Spanish refugees who fled Spain in the last months of the war were not welcomed with open arms. The French government put them in concentration camps, while most countries around the world closed their borders, with some notable exceptions, such as Mexico. During Germany’s occupation of France, as many as 15,000 of the Spanish Republicans interned in France were deported to Nazi camps, where some 5,000 died. And yet in 1945, as Europe was liberated from fascism, the Allies decided to leave Franco alone and let him retain his grip on Spain. By the 1950s, Franco had become a U.S. ally in the Cold War. That same Cold War reshaped how the story of the Spanish Civil War was told. In the U.S., it became common to paint the anti-fascist volunteers as communist dupes. In 1984, U.S. President Ronald Reagan famously said the Americans in Spain had joined the wrong side. [You’re smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversation’s authors and editors. You can read us daily by subscribing to our newsletter.] Prompted by the Ukraine war, some of these Cold War clichés are slipping back into mainstream journalism. The New York Times reporter covering Zelenskyy’s international fighters, for instance, wrote that the adventure of the Americans in Spain, “often romanticized as a valiant prelude to the fight against the Nazis,” had “ended badly.” In reality, many of those who fought fascism in Spain went on to join the Allied armies in World War II. Others formed the backbone of the resistance movements in Nazi- and fascist-occupied territories. Invoking the Spanish Civil War to frame the invasion of Ukraine as a clash between fascism and anti-fascism, moreover, plays into the Kremlin’s narrative, which seeks to portray the “special military operation” as an effort to “denazify” its western neighbor. Ironically, one of the most opportunistic invocations of the historical analogy occurred in Spain itself. In early March 2022, when Spain’s progressive governing coalition decided to send arms to the Zelenskyy government, the country’s largest newspaper, El País, ran a supportive editorial stating: “Today, the weapons to defend Ukraine are the weapons that the Second Spanish Republic did not have 80 years ago.” In fact, the controversial decision to provide arms was dividing the governing coalition; the paper’s heartstrings-tugging invocation of the embattled Spanish Republic was an obvious attempt to end the debate. If there is one way in which the Ukrainian analogy with Spain applies, it is the tragic way the country is being used as a proxy in a battle between the world’s great powers. In July 1937, Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens, journalist Martha Gellhorn and novelist Ernest Hemingway visited the White House to screen “The Spanish Earth,” Ivens’ documentary about the war. After seeing the film, Gellhorn recalled in a 1938 letter that President Franklin D. Roosevelt remarked, “Spain is a vicarious sacrifice for us all.” The same terrible fate seems to be reserved for Ukraine and its people.

3/18/2022,"* U.S. acting like a sheriff in a saloon - Lavrov * Russia will never rely on the West again * European Union has shown its weakness - Lavrov (Recasts headline and lead) By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Russia has lost any illusions about ever relying on the West and Moscow will never accept a world order dominated by the United States, which is acting like a sheriff seeking to call all the shots in a saloon bar, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Western nations have imposed sweeping sanctions across Russia's financial and corporate sectors in response to Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, plunging Russia's economy into its gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Lavrov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign minister since 2004, said the West's reaction to what Moscow has called a ""special military operation"" had illustrated that the West was completely dominated by the United States and that the European Union was largely powerless. ""If there was any illusion that we could one day rely on our Western partners, this illusion is no longer there,"" Lavrov told Russian state-funded RT in English. Russia would look eastwards, he said. ""What the Americans want is a unipolar world which would not be like a global village but like an American village - or maybe like a saloon where you know the strongest calls the shots,"" Lavrov said. He added that many countries such as China, India and Brazil did not want to be ordered around by ""Uncle Sam"" acting like a sheriff. Russia's invasion has killed thousands of people, displaced more than 3 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Lavrov's defiant response to the West's effort to isolate his country echoed that of Putin, who has indicated in recent days that the post-1991 era of Russian history has drawn to a close and that from now on Moscow will look to China, India and, increasingly, inwards. ""We will now have to rely only on ourselves and on our allies who stay with us,"" Lavrov said. ""We are not closing the door on the West - they are doing so."" As the Soviet Union crumbled and the Cold War ended, many in both Russia and the West hoped that the confrontations which had divided the post-World War Two world would recede or even be bridged. Putin says Moscow's actions in Ukraine were necessary because NATO's enlargement threatened Russia, and that Moscow needed to save Russian-speaking people in Ukraine from oppression. Ukraine casts the invasion as a Russian imperial-style land grab.

3/18/2022,"U.S. Justice Department officials announced Wednesday that federal prosecutors have charged five people for allegedly stalking, harassing and spying on U.S. residents on behalf of China’s secret police. The charges stem from three different complaints, which were unsealed Wednesday by a federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y. Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew Olsen said the cases were examples of what he described as an “alarming rise in transnational repression” by authoritarian governments. Last month, Olsen announced that efforts to fight transnational repression would be a main focus of the National Security Division’s new strategy to combat nation-state threats. “Transnational repression harms people in the United States and around the world and threatens the rule of law itself,” Olsen said at a press conference at Justice Department headquarters in Washington. In one of the alleged schemes, the defendant allegedly worked for the Ministry of State Security, China’s civilian intelligence and secret police agency, and conspired to sabotage the congressional campaign of a U.S. military veteran who, as a student in Beijing in 1989, was a leader of the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. Another case accuses three defendants of acting as agents of the Chinese government by spying on and conspiring to disseminate negative information about a number of pro-democracy Chinese dissidents living in New York City, California, Indiana and other parts of the U.S. One of the alleged victims is a Chinese dissident artist living in Los Angeles whose sculpture depicting Chinese President Xi Jinping as a coronavirus molecule was destroyed by the defendants, prosecutors say. The third case involves the founder of a pro-democracy group in Queens, N.Y., who, according to prosecutors, was secretly working for the Ministry of State Security and allegedly used his position among New York City’s Chinese community to collect information about prominent dissidents, activists and human rights leaders. “All of these victims were targeted because of pro-democracy views, because they chose to exercise their freedom of speech here in the United States,” said Breon Peace, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Peace said the three cases unsealed Wednesday “reveal the outrageous and dangerous lengths” to which the Chinese secret police have gone to “silence, harass, discredit and spy on” dissidents in the U.S. According to a press release issued by the Justice Department, three of the defendants were arrested this week and were scheduled to appear before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday afternoon, while the other two remain at large.",World/Yahoo News,Five charged with spying on U.S. residents for Chinese secret police,https://news.yahoo.com/five-charged-with-spying-on-us-residents-for-chinese-secret-police-200753789.html
3/18/2022,"(Reuters) - A former Russian deputy prime minister who spoke out against the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine has quit as chair of a prestigious foundation after a lawmaker accused him of a ""national betrayal"" and demanded his dismissal. Arkady Dvorkovich, deputy prime minister from 2012 to 2018, became one of Russia's most senior establishment figures to question the war when he told U.S. media this week that his thoughts were with Ukrainian civilians. His comments prompted a senior ruling party lawmaker to demand that he be fired and to accuse him of being part of a ""fifth column"" undermining Russia. The 49-year-old had been chairman since 2018 of the Skolkovo Foundation, an innovation and technology hub on the outskirts of Moscow that brands itself as a kind of Russian Silicon Valley. On Friday, the Skolkovo Foundation said in a statement that Dvorkovich had decided to step down. He could not be reached immediately for comment. He remains president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE). Igor Shuvalov, chairman of the foundation's board of directors, said Dvorkovich had resigned, saying that he could no longer combine his duties at Skolkovo with his responsibilities at FIDE under the current circumstances. Thousands of people have been detained for protesting against Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which officials in Moscow describe as a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""de-nazify"" its former Soviet neighbour. President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday delivered a stark warning to people he called ""traitors"" in Russia who he said the West wanted to use as a fifth column to destroy the country. After his comments to Western media, Dvorkovich said in a statement on Skolkovo's website that he was ""sincerely proud of the courage of our (Russian) soldiers"" and that Russia had been targeted by ""harsh and senseless sanctions"". But the following day, Andrei Turchak, a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party, called for his sacking. ""He has made his choice,"" Turchak said. ""This is nothing but the very national betrayal, the behaviour of the fifth column, which the president spoke about today.""

On Sunday, Russian missiles struck a military training facility near the Ukraine-Poland border, killing at least 35 people and prompting warnings from NATO countries. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the defensive alliance would respond to any attack on NATO territory — even an accidental strike. A senior U.S. defense official during a background briefing Thursday said there have been more than 1,000 observed missile launches by Russian against Ukraine so far. The official said that Russian forces appear to be increasingly relying on non-precision-guided munitions more than at the start of the invasion, which suggests that ""they might be either conserving their precision-guided munitions or beginning to experience shortages.""

3/18/2022,"A Russian oligarch moved $1.3 billion shares to an offshore tax-haven the day he was sanctioned, filings suggest. A company controlled by steel tycoon Alexei Mordashov sold the shares, in travel giant TUI, on February 28. Mordashov has been sanctioned by the European Union and the UK since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A Russian oligarch moved $1.3 billion worth of shares to an offshore tax-haven the day he was hit with Ukraine war sanctions, regulatory and corporate filings suggest. On February 28, a firm controlled by Alexei Mordashov, one of Russia's richest businessman, sold a 29.9% stake in TUI, the world's largest tour operator, to a company in the British Virgin Islands, the filings show. The company that bought Mordashov's TUI shares, Ondero, is affiliated with the oligarch, according to Bloomberg. The British Virgin Islands, a British overseas territory, doesn't charge corporate, capital gains, or wealth taxes. Mordashov, a steel tycoon, is the second-richest person in Russia with a net worth of $22.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Before the share sale, Mordashov was TUI's top shareholder, with a stake of 34%, and had been a shareholder for around 15 years, according to a press release published by TUI shortly after he was sanctioned by the European Union. Mordashov resigned from TUI's board on March 2, the company said. Mordashov held his stake in TUI via Cyprus-based Unifirm, a company that is in turn owned by firms controlled by Mordashov and his sons, according to Bloomberg. A 29.9% stake in TUI was sold to Ondero on February 28, according to a TUI filing published March 5. Another 4.1% was sold to Russian investment firm Severgroup, according to a March 4 filing. Severgroup is owned by Mordashov. TUI indicated to Insider it couldn't identify the shareholders of Ondero. ""We would only know by receiving a voting rights notification of a controlling stakeholder,"" a TUI spokesperson told Insider. ""We can only attribute the Severgroup stake to Mr Mordashov,"" the TUI spokesperson said. ""This would mean that he does not have access to his shares and cannot derive any economical benefit from them,"" the spokesperson added. Insider couldn't reach Mordashov or his representative for comment. His spokesperson earlier declined to comment to Bloomberg. Mordashov ceased to have control of Unifirm on February 28, according to the March 5 filing by TUI. Sweeping sanctions have hit Russia and some of its richest people since the country invaded Ukraine. Many of the restrictions target oligarchs, spurring them to shuffle their holdings in their businesses, including shifting shareholdings and assets around intricate webs of onshore and offshore companies. Such structures are often used by oligarchs to hide their wealth, complicating attempts to seize their assets. Earlier this month, Mordashov shifted control of a $1.1 billion stake in a mining company to his wife.

3/18/2022,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) -The Biden administration made a carefully orchestrated gamble this week, issuing a series of public and private threats to Beijing that it will face consequences if it supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The strategy was capped by a tense, seven-hour meeting in Rome on Monday between U.S. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi. Having fired loud diplomatic salvos at Beijing, Biden administration officials are still debating the next steps to take to ensure China does not help Russia evade Western sanctions or supply weapons to Moscow as casualties mount in Ukraine. One result of the Rome meeting was announced on Thursday - Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak with Biden on Friday about ""managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine,"" the White House said. It is not likely to be an easy conversation. Beijing was combative in the Rome talks, people briefed on the interactions say. One U.S.-based person briefed on the meeting described Chinese officials' response as ""tough"" and ""offensive."" Another said simply that the talks did not go well. Washington is now sorting through a host of unanswered questions, including where any ""red line"" regarding Ukraine that China would need to cross to trigger a U.S. response is, and what exactly that response would be, administration officials say. The Biden administration is waiting to see what China does before deciding on a course of action. ""We're going to be watching closely,"" said White House spokesperson Jen Psaki on Monday. A senior U.S. official said they would be looking at what military, economic, or other support is being provided to Russia. The United States on Monday told allies in NATO and several Asian countries that China had signaled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, an accusation that China denies. Sullivan had warned before the talks that China would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over Ukraine. China, which announced a ""no limits"" strategic partnership with Russia in February, may find it hard to change course and back down after a threat was made public, said Kevin Gallagher, who leads the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University. ""This wasn't a good strategic move,"" he said. ""Like the United States, China has a domestic constituency."" He Weiwen, senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Beijing's Renmin University said: ""The U.S. has an intention to crackdown on China, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict provides a reason for it to do so,"" describing the U.S. warnings as ""blackmail."" Sources in the Biden administration and diplomats in Washington and Europe say Western countries had been sending private warnings to Beijing about China's support for Russian President Vladimir Putin for weeks before the Rome meeting. Russia has denied asking China for military assistance, and China warned this week of ""false information,"" in apparent reference to U.S. statements. ""China firmly opposes any words and deeds that spread false information and distort and smear China's position,"" Yang said, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Beijing's official newspaper, the People's Daily, carried a column noting the inaccurate U.S. intelligence that led to the Iraq invasion. Some U.S. allies also quietly questioned the intelligence Washington was relying upon regarding the Russian and Chinese conversations, several European diplomatic sources said. SANCTIONS DISCUSSIONS NOT ADVANCED Discussions between the United States and its military allies of any coordinated sanctions that could apply to Beijing are not advanced, according to one person involved in those conversations. A move to sanction China over Ukraine would have potentially dire consequences, not just for China, but for the U.S. and global economies, analysts say. China trades vastly more with the United States and its NATO than it does with Russia, and the Chinese economy relies heavily on international markets and capital. However, the talks between Sullivan and Yang did not focus on trade, one U.S. official noted. Biden entered office regarding China as the key foreign policy challenge of the era, one that required a more hardline defense of democratic values against autocratic competitors. But Biden hoped that his candid personal relationship with China's leader could defuse the likelihood of a Cold War or a direct military clash between the world's current superpower and its rising superpower, including over the status of Taiwan. ""China is either going to side with Russia and reinforce the sense that it has joined an 'axis of autocracy,' or it is going to put significant space between Moscow and Beijing and demonstrate that it genuinely cares about preserving even a basic relationship with the rest of the world,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""If it turns down this opportunity, it's not clear to me there will be a next time to meet and set aside differences. The ball is entirely in Beijing's court.""
