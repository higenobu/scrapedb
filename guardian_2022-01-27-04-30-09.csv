1/27/2022,"A frog has regrown a lost leg after being treated with a cocktail of drugs in a significant advance for regenerative medicine. The African clawed frog, which is naturally unable to regenerate its limbs, was treated with the drugs for just 24 hours and this prompted an 18-month period of regrowth of a functional leg. The demonstration raises the prospect that in the future drugs could be used to switch on similar untapped abilities for regeneration in human patients to restore tissues or organs lost to disease or injury.  “It’s exciting to see that the drugs we selected were helping to create an almost complete limb,” said Nirosha Murugan of Tufts University in Massachusetts and first author of the paper. “The fact that it required only a brief exposure to the drugs to set in motion a months-long regeneration process suggests that frogs and perhaps other animals may have dormant regenerative capabilities that can be triggered into action.” Many creatures are able to fully regenerate at least some limbs, including salamanders, starfish, crabs and lizards. Flatworms can even be chopped into pieces, with each piece reconstructing an entire organism. Humans have some regenerative capabilities – the liver can regrow to full size after being halved and children can regrow the tips of their fingers. However, the loss of a large, complex limb cannot be restored by any natural process in mammals. The rapid formation of scar tissue protects us from blood loss and infection, but also prevents regrowth. In the latest research, published in the journal Science Advances, the scientists amputated a frog’s hind-leg and enclosed the wound in silicone cap containing a five-drug cocktail. The drugs each had a different purpose, including reducing inflammation and the production of collagen to stop scar tissue growing. The drugs also aimed to promote the growth of new nerve fibres, blood vessels and muscle. The experiment was repeated in dozens of frogs and many of those treated had a dramatic regrowth of tissue, with many re-creating an almost fully functional leg, including bone tissue and even toe-like structures at the end of the limb. The regrown limb moved, responded to touch and the frogs were able to make use of it for swimming. In the first few days of treatment scientists observed the activation of molecular pathways that are normally used to map out limbs in the developing embryo. They believe that adult humans still retain the information needed to make body structures and that, in theory, it should be possible to tap into this dormant ability. “Covering the open wound with a liquid environment under the [silicone cap], with the right drug cocktail, could provide the necessary first signals to set the regenerative process in motion,” said Michael Levin, Vannevar Bush professor of biology and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts. The team now plan to test the technique in mammals. Bob Lanza, head of Astellas Global Regenerative Medicine, who was not involved in the research, described the advance as an “amazing achievement”. “The study has extremely exciting ramifications for regenerative medicine,” said Lanza. “Although frogs have much greater regenerative capacity than humans, this is a very important first step. With the right combination of drugs and factors a similar approach could potentially spur regeneration and restore lost function in humans.” Michael Schneider, a professor in cardiology at Imperial College London, said that the findings could have applications in other areas of regeneration, such as the possibility of scarless healing, after a heart attack. “The results are highly intriguing for human regenerative medicine, beyond just their implications for the limb,” he said. “As the authors acknowledge, a crucial step to be made before any human testing will be proof that this approach, possibly with further refinements, also can be applied to mammals.”",News/Science,Frog regrows amputated leg after being given drug treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/26/frog-regrows-amputated-leg-after-being-given-drug-treatment
1/27/2022,"The government was forced to deny claims that it had scrapped a crucial economic crime bill on Wednesday, as MPs from across the house rounded on ministers for failing to tackle the UK capital’s “Londongrad” reputation as a money-laundering hub used by Russian oligarchs, criminals and kleptocrats. The scathing comments in the House of Commons follow the shock resignation of junior minster Lord Agnew on Monday, who revealed in his departing letter that the government had only last week made a “foolish” decision to kill off the bill during the next parliamentary year.  As recently as December, prime minister Boris Johnson promised a “year of action” on fraud at a summit organised by US president Joe Biden, saying the government would target “the illicit finance that undermines democracy everywhere, strengthening our law enforcement powers to go after the criminals who abuse our corporate structures”. Agnew had also hit out at the government for failing to take action against Covid loan fraud, which critics have said could cost the taxpayer billions of pounds. The damning accusations pushed Rishi Sunak to assure that the government would “do everything we can” to recover stolen funds. “I’m not ignoring it, and I’m definitely not ‘writing it off,’” the chancellor said on Twitter on Wednesday. Figures from HMRC show an estimated £5.8bn has been lost due to to fraudulent claims for furlough and other business relief schemes. Reports suggest HMRC has off £4.3bn stolen of that sum as unrecoverable. However, the government has refused to confirm the figure. 1/ A lot of people are concerned about fraud in our Covid support measures and they’re absolutely right to be.No, I’m not ignoring it, and I'm definitely not ‘writing it off’ 👇 MPs said the economic crime bill was needed to tackle the Covid loan fraud issues raised by Agnew, and the use of London as a money laundering destination by kleptocrats from Russia and other regimes. Campaigners had been pushing for the bill to be included in the next parliamentary session, which run s from later this year into 2023, and will be announced at the next Queen’s speech. It was expected to include reforms of Companies House, the loosely policed UK company registry, and rules requiring those holding property through offshore shell companies to declare their identities. Paul Scully, the parliamentary under-secretary for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, was called to the Commons to answer an urgent question on the status of the bill. He said: “There has been nothing pulled at all.” But Scully said no legislation would be put forward before the yet-unscheduled Queen’s speech, which opens a new parliamentary year. The government has not yet set a date for the speech, but last year held the state opening in May. It comes as Downing Street considers sanctions against Russia if Moscow follows through on an invasion of Ukraine. “Up to 50% of money flowing through Russian laundromats – often used for tax avoidance stolen public funds and to launder monies derived from organised crime – flow through UK shell companies,” said Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake, who initiated the debate by tabling the urgent question. “This is not a notional white collar offence,” he said added. “It affects real people in very tangible ways. Terrorists and drug dealers depend on it to launder and legitimise their money through UK banks, companies and properties.” SNP MP Alison Thewliss urged the government to set a date for the introduction of the economic crime bill, saying the lack of action suggested complacency on behalf of prime minister Boris Johnson’s Cabinet. “Why is it that this government is so unconcerned that the UK is being deemed “Londongrad”, notorious for laundering of dirty money?” John Penrose, the Conservative MP for Weston-super-Mare also accused the government of moving too slowly. “The well of excuses after three or four years of promising this piece of legislation, or its related pieces, has now run dry. And it is absolutely essential for the credibility of his country and of this government, particularly the time when we have a crisis in Ukraine, and all sorts of Russian oligarchs waiting to move money into this country if they possibly can … that we do not back away from the central piece of legislation,” he added. Labour MP Chris Bryant said the UK’s rules, as they currently stand, are too “soft touch” and that “if we want to give a strong message to Russia in particular at this moment we’ve got to move swiftly not say ‘oh, I can’t possibly come into what legislation we might be thinking of in the future.’” But Scully refused to be pulled into speculation about the timing of the bill’s introduction. “What I can’t do is pre-empt what Her Majesty will say in the Queen’s speech,” he said, adding that she would “set out the government’s programming in due course,.”",News/Business,Ministers criticised for not tackling London’s reputation as money-laundering hub,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/ministers-criticised-for-not-tackling-londons-reputation-as-money-laundering-hub
1/27/2022,"Up to 2,000 Islamic State inmates who had overrun a Syrian prison have surrendered to their Kurdish captors, ending a six-day siege that marked the terror group’s most dramatic stand since the collapse of its so called caliphate nearly three years ago. The peaceful finale to the standoff on Wednesday was at odds with its bloody beginnings when up to 100 extremists tried to storm the facility in the northern city of Hasakah and free those jailed inside. The raid on Thursday night, which was led by two suicide bombers, led to days of intense clashes, which claimed the lives of close to 40 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces and about 30 jihadists, and forced more than 50,000 civilians to flee.  It also drew attention to the fate of up to 700 boys and youths, who had been kept in a wing of the prison. Their condition was not initially clear, but there were no reports of further violence or deaths after alarm was raised for their safety on Monday after several nearly US airstrikes and intensive gunfire. Ahead of the surrender, global concern had continued to mount. “These children should never have been held in military detention in the first place,” said Unicef executive director, Henrietta Fore. “The violence they are subjected to may amount to war crimes.” The UN said most of the children in the prison were Syrian and Iraqis, many of them orphans. However, the rest were made up of 20 other nationalities and their continued incarceration once again raised demands that they be repatriated. “None of them has been charged with any crime under national or international law,” said Fore. “The children of foreign nationals have received little to no support from their home countries.” After the surrender, the SDF posted photographs of rows of men standing outside the walls of the prison, many dressed in the distinctive orange overalls worn by alleged terrorists in prisons on both sides of the Euphrates. In Hasakah, there was widespread relief among locals who had initially feared that the storming of the prison had freed hundreds of extremists “Now they are saying that it’s over, we hope this is the end so we can start our normal life again,” said Fawaz al Aswad, 35, from the Azizia area. “During this past week we were not afraid of gunfire but we were afraid of Isis sleeper cells. No one got hurt from my family, but one of my neighbours died. He was an SDF fighter.” “We could hear gunfire all the time,” said Hala Muhammed, 31. “We were very afraid. If all countries have taken their Isis fighter(s) back now this would not happen. But it seems they want Isis to remain here for the time being.” Meanwhile, in north-western Syria a disturbance of a different kind – a savage winter storm – continues to cause disruption, with heavy snow and strong winds damaging thousands of tents used by the more than 1.5 million refugees in the province. NGOs have stepped up campaigns for funding for blankets and heating as the storm that brought deep snow to Istanbul and plunging temperatures from northern Iraq to Gaza continued to rage. The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) said that at least 545 tents have been reported destroyed and 9,125 tents damaged by snowfall, floods and winds. “The snow, freezing rain, and sub-zero temperatures are especially harmful to children, the elderly, and people with disabilities living in flimsy tents without insulation, adequate winter clothing, and heat,” it said in a statement. One group of aid workers, the Molham Team, recently raised more than $1m in less than two days to re-house 250 families in Syria’s north-west from tents into houses. The appeal, with the Twitter hashtag #untilthelasttent, initially aimed to raise $500,000 and help 100 families, but double that amount was donated, and the group was able to rehouse the entire camp.

1/27/2022,"Police will ask aides of Boris Johnson who are named in Sue Gray’s report as having attended parties during lockdown if they are guilty and thus accept a fine under regulations passed by the government they work for. Some could be asked in writing to accept or dispute the findings from Gray, while others will have to be interviewed under caution. The investigation is expected to take at least several weeks, with detectives prepared to expand their inquiry if further evidence emerges.  The Metropolitan police will take Gray’s evidence and ask those she finds to have attended gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall whether they have a reasonable excuse, sources say. Sources add that, while the lockdown-breaking offences are relatively minor and do not result in a criminal record if paid promptly, any attempts to lie, or to get others to lie, could see an escalation of Scotland Yard’s inquiry with perverting the course of justice investigations launched. Suspicion of committing such offences could lead to arrest, full criminal investigation and potentially time in jail if convicted. One police source said: “Lying could lead to a charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice,” and cited the example of those facing motoring fines whose lies amount to more serious offences, such as the former MP Chris Huhne, who ended up being jailed. A second source said “conspiracy to pervert would seem to apply” if concerted attempts were made to thwart the police investigation. The Met decided which of the alleged string of parties it would investigate on Tuesday, just before the commissioner, Cressida Dick, made her announcement. The broad findings from Gray were passed to the Met special inquiries team, which matched them up with the coronavirus laws at the times. The Met has asked Gray for the underlying evidence supporting the conclusions, such as data showing which people attended parties from emails or security cards. One source said detectives were “waiting to get under the hood” of the evidence gathered by Gray with the Met investigation at an early stage. One police source with extensive knowledge of policing the Covid regulations said: “You do not need to show criminal intent or a mens rea, simply showing you are there is enough, so a photo, or email might be enough to issue a ticket.” Met officers will trigger the fines process by sending paperwork to the criminal records office based in Hampshire, who technically issue the fine, which arrives by post with details of how to pay. The levels of fines will vary according to which regulations were in place at the time, as the penalties changed. 118,963 fines were issued in England and Wales until 19 December 2021. Some may choose to take the fine, while anyone who denies their guilt could force a fuller police investigation taking more time and resources, as they then would have to get cases ready for a magistrates court hearing. The former Met detective Simon Harding warned: “You can’t force people to talk.” The investigation will have to see what evidence from Gray would be admissible in the English court system, and thus may have to redo some of her team’s work. A source added other allegations would be looked at if evidence not found by Gray or new testimony emerged, amid claims some Johnson aides would not trust the civil servant’s inquiry, which was reporting to the prime minister, but may be more forthcoming with police officers independent of government. The Met’s investigation was announced after weeks of the force declining to do so saying it rarely investigated offences retrospectively. Dick said retrospective action had been taken against her own officers, and this includes 31 officers issued with £200 fines for having their haircut by a barber visiting an east London police station. It also includes nine officers photographed dining with each other in a cafe, with both incidents taking place in January 2021. The Met investigation into the Downing Street and Whitehall parties will be overseen by the acting deputy assistant commissioner, Jane Connors, and Commander Catherine Roper.

1/27/2022,"A woman stabbed to death by her abusive ex-husband in west London told a friend she was scared “he will kill me” two years before Monday’s knife attack. Yasmin Chkaifi, 43, was murdered by Leon McCaskre in front of horrified onlookers in Chippenham Road, Maida Vale, who himself died after being hit by a car.  The mother-of-two told a close friend in 2020 that she felt her life was in danger because of her abusive former partner, who she said had put cameras in her flat and stolen her post and phone. Her friend, Adele-Sara Richards, told the PA news agency that in April 2020 Chkaifi messaged her to say: “He’s had cameras in my house recording me for months. “He’s stolen my mail, my phone, has access to all my personal data. I think he will kill me. I’ve tried everything.” One of her sons told MailOnline that she had been continually harassed by her ex-husband, who had made her life “hell”. “It was a very abusive relationship, which got worse after the divorce,” he said. “My mother was continually being harassed and intimidated by this man. He made her life hell. “I was always in touch with the police but they did nothing to help her. There was even a panic alarm installed in our flat – that’s how scared she was of this man. He was a monster.” The 26-year-old driver of the car that hit McCaskre was later arrested on suspicion of murder and has been released on bail until late February while the police investigation continues. Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for the driver not to face charges. Meanwhile tributes have been paid to Chkaifi, who was known as Yaz and Wafat. She was a qualified childminder, had worked in a school and was studying for a master’s degree. In a statement posted on Facebook, her family said: “She was full of life, always stayed positive and always saw the best in everyone. Wafat loved to laugh, dance and leave a special impact on everyone’s life that got to share it with her. She has indeed left many broken from this awful and tragic news. “Wafat was the most pure and genuine soul you would meet. She has left two amazing boys who will continue her legacy of being pure souls.” Another friend, Olivia Jones, said: “She was incredibly kind, hospitable and an amazing cook and dancer.

1/27/2022,"It ended, as it had for a long time seemed that it would, with penalties. Eric Bailly, who had had an excellent game, had his dinked effort pushed against the bar by Egypt’s substitute keeper Mohamed Abou Gabal, and that was enough for Egypt to extend their unbeaten run against Ivory Coast in Africa Cups of Nations to six games and progress to the last eight. And it was enough for Carlos Queiroz to claim another triumph by suffocation.  Queiroz, unbending, unyielding, remains the same as he always been. His hair may slowly be retreating from his crown with each passing year but the hands-on-hip prowl around his technical area means the same as it ever did. So too does the football. Queiroz has spent the tournament despairing of fans who doubt his cautious approach and demand Egypt “kick the ball forward, kick the ball forward”, insisting he was content to wait for “one small mistake, one rebound”. Against this Ivorian defence, it was less likely to be one small mistake than several big ones. The pitch in Douala is probably even more disappointing than the media facilities, which perhaps offers some excuse, but again and again passes were misplaced. As Queiroz had hinted, Egypt didn’t so much try to create anything as wait for Ivory Coast to present them with the ball but, as in the group stage, a vaunted forward line squandered the opportunities. Omar Marmoush pinged a 15th-minute shot off the bar but, that aside, Egypt’s threat was largely theoretical. The Ivory Coast coach, Patrice Beaumelle, has twice won the Cup of Nations as assistant to Hervé Renard and apes Renard’s famous lucky white shirt. The rugged Mills and Boon look, though, is rather undermined by his decision to pair the shirt with a pair of Jerry Seinfeld trainers. Oddly what gave Ivory Coast a chance was the loss of Franck Kessié to injury after half an hour. Although that clearly weakened the Ivorians’ midfield, by encouraging Egypt to attack a little more, it did create space for them to counter into, as they had so successfully against Algeria. The result was that, as the tempo rose in the second half, the game seemed a contest of the terrible finishing of Egypt and the terrible crossing of Ivory Coast. But Queiroz soon put a stop to that. Egypt became increasingly conservative and wasted time at every opportunity. It was all very familiar; Egypt too have always been masters of that if they feel the game might be slipping form them, as Ivory Coast found in Cairo in 2006 in the Cup of Nations final. Queiroz is a master of this. He preaches control and, while a shootout clearly offers no guarantees, it was better than the alternative of taking Ivory Coast on in an open game. And when you have Mohamed Salah taking your final penalty, that does tip things in your favour. Morocco will be harder to stifle on Sunday, but Queiroz will not change: Egypt are in the last eight having only scored two goals.",Sport/Football,Mohamed Salah’s nerveless shootout penalty takes Egypt past Ivory Coast,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/26/mohamed-salahs-nerveless-shootout-penalty-takes-egypt-past-ivory-coast
1/27/2022,"Boris Johnson’s plight is leaving government in a state of near-paralysis, with key decisions delayed while No 10 focuses on defending the prime minister amid the Downing Street parties scandal, sources say. “It’s not as easy to get policy through if it has to involve No 10 at the moment. I’m aware the civil servants feel it – feel the slowdown,” said one frustrated aide in a Whitehall department. “You just need to have things to carry on doing.”  Michael Gove’s levelling-up white paper was expected before Christmas but has been repeatedly delayed – though sources in his department insist that is as much to do with the Omicron Covid surge as “partygate”. One MP who has been given a preview of the policy paper said they were underwhelmed and expressed concern that the government’s internal turmoil means strategic direction has been lacking. Despite inflation hitting a 30-year high, and with energy prices set to jump sharply in April, the government is also yet to present a plan to alleviate the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said to Boris Johnson on Wednesday: “What’s utterly damning, despite the huff and puff, is that this [the parties scandal] is all happening when petrol prices, the weekly shop, and energy bills are going through the roof.” He said of government ministers, many of whom have spent recent media rounds explaining away the allegations of rule-breaking parties: “Instead of getting on with their jobs, they’re wheeled out to save his.” Marking two years since Brexit, Johnson told his cabinet on Tuesday that “we must be bold to unleash growth and innovation, and show the British people, businesses and investors that things are changing for the better”. Yet civil servants point to the relatively empty parliamentary timetable, with little heavyweight legislation under discussion, as evidence of the lack of direction from the centre of government. The House of Commons adjourned before 5pm on Wednesday. Tim Durrant, associate director of Whitehall thinktank the Institute for Government, said of the partygate row: “It just sucks up everyone’s attention, that’s the problem … Whether or not they’re directly involved, ministers are always being asked: ‘Do you support the prime minister?’ So they’re having to defend him. They’re not able to get on with other things.” He pointed out that every hour spent by Johnson wooing backbenchers is time he cannot spend being briefed about the crisis in Ukraine, or other pressing concerns. “It’s not just about his time, it’s about the rest of government,” he added. “Ministers are paying attention to what’s going on, officials are following what’s going on; people will be thinking about, what are the various scenarios we need to be planning for, in case there are changes.” With Johnson asking wavering MPs what policies they would like to see implemented, there are also concerns that policy decisions civil servants believed had been settled could now be reversed. The prime minister has come under intense pressure, including from some members of his cabinet, to reconsider the increase in national insurance contributions due to take effect in April. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, wrung the commitment to the tax rise from Johnson in exchange for signing off on a surge in spending on the NHS, and sees himself as the representative of the Tory tradition of sound money. Sunak’s aides insist there have been no conversations between the pair about postponing or cancelling the increase, and Johnson’s spokesperson insisted on Tuesday there were “no plans” to do so. But government insiders fear the government’s stance on this and other issues may now be in flux as Johnson bids to win over sceptics in his own party in advance of a potential no confidence vote. Those policies that have been announced recently – including the freeze on the BBC licence fee, and the enhanced involvement of the military in tackling small boat Channel crossings – appear to be aimed at placating rightwing backbenchers.",News/Politics,"UK government being immobilised by Boris Johnson crisis, say sources",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/26/uk-government-being-immobilised-by-boris-johnson-crisis-say-insiders
1/27/2022,"Some regions that produce coffee, cashews and avocados may not be able to support the growing of these crops within decades as a result of global heating, a study has found. Researchers combined climate change projections and soil factors to model how suitable various regions will be for growing crops in 2050. The analysis found that all major coffee-producing regions face a decline in suitability, including Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.  For cashews, major growing regions such as India, Ivory Coast and Benin are predicted to become less suitable, while for avocados areas including the Dominican Republic, Peru and Indonesia will suffer. For all three crops, appropriate growing regions may open up at higher altitudes and latitudes, particularly for cashews and avocados. The US, Argentina, China and countries in east Africa are predicted to benefit the most. The study found that climate change adaptation will be necessary in many major producing regions, with potential mitigation measures including adaptations in plant breeding and site-specific management. “It was important to investigate where there will be shifts amongst suitable growing regions for all three crops due to climate change, with both expansions and contractions. This is why we put a focus on today’s main producing countries,” said Dr Roman Grüter, of ZHAW School of Life Sciences and Facility Management in Switzerland, who was the lead author of the paper. “In our suitability model, we wanted to prioritise regions where crops were locally adapted already. “When you identify regions that are climatically suitable for growing crops, the typography and soil factors are critical for cultivating crops and that’s why we took them into account in our model, as well as taking into account climate projections for 2050. Due to a negative impact on crop suitability in those countries there will be adaptation measures required in all of those regions with all three crops.” Dr Paul Jensen, of the Sustainability Research Institute at the University of Leeds, who was not involved in the study, said: “The research demonstrates the wide range and complexity of crop management considerations that food system stakeholders need to increasingly consider in the face of both extreme and minimal climate change scenarios. Long-term planning for how we manage the agricultural environment, without simply moving cultivation and related environmental impacts to new areas, is needed now to secure supplies of not only luxury crops such as those covered in the study, but also many staple crops that we all rely on. “This is particularly true of those crops that support the livelihood of smallholder farmers across the globe. If smaller entities in the global food system are not suitably supported in terms of understanding the impact of climate change and adaptation strategies and opportunities, we will see yet again that the most vulnerable in society will be those that suffer first and the most as climate change takes hold.”",News/Environment,"Regions growing coffee, cashews and avocados at risk amid global heating",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/regions-growing-coffee-cashews-and-avocados-at-risk-amid-global-heating
1/27/2022,"A litter of hairless French bulldogs has been branded a worrying example of “extreme breeding” by the British Veterinary Association, which has voiced concerns that some owners are prioritising novelty over the health of their pet. The dogs are believed to have been bred in Scotland and to be the result of crosses between French bulldogs, Pugs and Chinese crested dogs. They are thought to be the first litter of hairless French bulldogs in the UK.  But the national body for veterinary surgeons in the UK has warned that while the puppies might be healthy, they could end up with myriad problems, including a susceptibility to sunburn and heat stress as well as breathing difficulties. “Just because people like things to look a certain way it shouldn’t justify people being able to do things to these dogs that we know is going to cause potential harm and suffering and welfare issues,” said Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association. “I’m just really disappointed when I see things like this and I wish that we can get potential owners to understand how much some of this extreme breeding really does affect the day to day welfare of these dogs,” she added. It is not the first time hairless French bulldogs have been produced – one such dog made headlines when it entered the US after apparently being bought from China. At the time of the report vets described the animal as a “monster” and raised concerns that it could be at increased risk of painful acne, dermatitis and skin cancer. Shotton said the latest litter is just one example of extreme breeding, adding the novelty factor, “cuteness”, or chance to notch up likes on social media may be among the motivations for breeding and buying unusual crosses. “We feel like a lot of these types of dogs that are being marketed as very rare or particularly unique, are just being bred as a sort of popularity thing to get people potentially attracted to these dogs, because they’re almost a status symbol, rather than thinking about the welfare of the dogs themselves,” she said. Shotton added that while crossbreeds have sometimes been thought to be healthier than pedigree dogs, that is not necessarily the case, noting that crossing breeds that have particular health issues can mean the offspring get the worst of both worlds. “Unfortunately, in some of the crosses, [vets are] seeing a multiplication of problems,” she said. Hairless dogs can find it difficult to keep warm and are at increased risk of sunburn, and other skin problems, while flat-faced, or brachycephalic, dogs are known to be at increased risk of breathing difficulties, as well as being prone to heatstroke, eye ulcers, spinal problems and skin disorders. A new study published in the journal Plos One by researchers at the Royal Veterinary College, found that flat-faced dogs have almost seven times the odds of prolapsed nictitating membrane gland – or “cherry eye” – compared with dogs that have a head of medium proportions, with high levels of this disorder also seen in “designer” crosses such as Puggles. If not dealt with, the authors warn the condition can lead to chronic problems including inflammation or infection which may cause discomfort or pain. Dr Dan O’Neill, co-author of the study, said the development of new flat-faced breeds with even more extreme characteristics – as would be the case with hairless French bulldogs – goes against the position of the UK Brachycephalic working group who have described such breeding as “unacceptable”. A spokesperson for the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) said crosses of certain dogs were worrying, adding the organisation has a confidential helpline for anyone with concerns about low-welfare breeding. “The Scottish SPCA is extremely concerned about the increase in unscrupulous breeders breeding dogs with exaggerated characteristics and attempting specialist medical procedures without training. We are spearheading a taskforce to look in to these issues specifically,” they said.",Lifestyle/Life and style,First UK hairless French bulldog litter prompts ‘extreme breeding’ concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/26/first-uk-hairless-french-bulldog-litter-prompts-extreme-breeding-concerns
1/27/2022,"The hallmarks of this government have been its cavalier disregard for integrity, accountability and honesty. But there are exceptions; Lord Agnew’s resignation shows ministers can do the right thing. The counter-fraud minister decided to leave over the alarming scale of pilfering taking place under the government’s coronavirus support scheme, and colleagues’ apparent unwillingness to do anything about it. His departure should be a wake-up call. Since May 2020, around £50bn had been lent out to firms under the government-backed Covid loan scheme. The National Audit Office last December warned it had “limited verification, and no credit checks on borrowers, which made it vulnerable to fraud and losses”. The government also chose not to disclose the companies in receipt of Bounce Back loans, leaving ministers open to accusations that there was something to hide. Lord Agnew agreed, saying “desperately inadequate” efforts were made to stop government cash being stolen. The Tory peer thought that Covid loan fraud ran as high as 26%, which suggests the state handed over £10bn to thieves. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, denied “ignoring” fraudulently claimed Covid support funds, saying he would recover looted monies. Lord Agnew thinks doing so would give Mr Sunak a “sporting chance of cutting income tax before a likely May 2024 election”. This is true under the Treasury’s fiscal rules. Labour says recouping such losses would mean hardly any need for a national insurance hike.  On offer from the government were advances of up to £50,000, or a maximum of 25% of annual turnover, to support businesses during the pandemic. More than 1.5m loans were made. Yet there are only about 1.4m UK private sector businesses with employees. That more than 100% of UK businesses could have taken advantage of self-certified loans that were granted in 24 hours and for which the state was wholly liable should have rung alarm bells. Lord Agnew said schoolboy errors were made; more than 1,000 companies received state loans that were not even trading when Covid struck. Counter-fraud measures weren’t put in place. Simple acts could have helped. David Clarke, the former chair of the Fraud Advisory Panel, proposed to MPs last year that a centralised bank data repository could have identified long-dormant company accounts that received government cash. Companies House fails to undertake basic checks on its corporate register. Inexplicably, ministers have shelved long-promised plans to overhaul it. The former minister blames the banks for the losses. Lenders had no reason to implement checks as there was a 100% state guarantee for non-payment. Honest businesses needed the money to pay the rent. This cash helped landlords pay their mortgages – which in turn kept banks flush with cash. Bankers also make money by creating and selling mortgage derivatives, a financial investment instrument that depends on the underlying value of property loans. If they went bad, then potentially billions of pounds in the Square Mile might be affected. No wonder many finance houses are reporting record profits. The suspicion is that losing £10bn to fraud might have been seen as an acceptable price to pay to keep the UK’s jewel in the crown – the City – safe from harm. But if that is the case, then it is just another example of how finance has become an end in itself, unhinged from the economy and from the people and businesses it ought to serve.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on a Tory resignation: a minister goes over government failure | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-a-tory-resignation-a-minister-goes-over-government-failure
1/27/2022,"In his latest film, released in the UK this week, Pedro Almodóvar breaks new ground in a career that began as Spain started to transition to democracy in the late 1970s. Until now, the great director’s work has virtually ignored the dark decades of dictatorship under General Francisco Franco. “It was my way of getting revenge on him,” he explained to the Guardian last week. “But it didn’t mean to say I’d forgotten.” After Franco’s death in 1975, a “pact of forgetting” and an Amnesty Law largely drew a veil over the bloody atrocities of the Spanish civil war and the repressive era of dictatorship, allowing a traumatised population to move on. As the plot of Parallel Mothers reflects, this mood has given way on the left to a determination to bear witness to crimes never recognised or atoned for. The film stars Penelope Cruz as a photographer determined to exhume bodies from a mass grave near her village, where she believes her Republican great-grandfather lies after being summarily executed by fascist forces.  In recent years, such exhumations have been sought and performed throughout Spain, and more than 100,000 bodies are known to still lie in unmarked graves. The Socialist-led government plans to make new funds and resources available for digs, as well as other activities and research related to historical memory. As work progresses, civil war historians have been able to draw on new sources to better understand the horrors of the time and the specific nature of the fascist terror unleashed across the country. Last year, the government moved to outlaw the defence and cultural celebration of the Franco era. There has, inevitably, been a backlash. Many conservatives argue that the historical memory movement has unnecessarily stirred up division and recrimination. A culture war over the politics of memory is underway. This week, for example, Madrid’s rightwing city council restored the name of a street which memorialises a nationalist ship that shelled civilians in 1937. The rise of the nationalist Vox party has emboldened parts of the right which aim to rehabilitate the Franco era and the nationalist cause in the civil war. The direction of travel, though, is clear. For some time, plans have been underway for Spain’s first national museum devoted to the civil war, located in the Aragonese battleground town of Teruel. A commission of experts from across the political spectrum is to decide how to tell the story of the conflict, focusing particularly on the suffering of the civilian population. Its architects, led by the former Socialist MP and professor of politics, Javier Paniagua, hope that the £5m project can become a Spanish equivalent to the Verdun memorial or the Imperial War Museum. This is unlikely to be a museum which will appeal to Vox supporters. But Mr Paniagua said that the aim will be to fairly portray nationalist and republican perspectives, in an effort to enhance understanding of why a national tragedy took place. In an age of polarisation this is surely the right approach, however challenging and ambitious. Collective amnesia was perhaps an understandable option for a generation desperate to embrace a democratic future in the 1970s. But as Mr Almodóvar points out: “Remembering is part of the soul of who we are.” It will be a mighty task, but more than 80 years after the civil war ended, Teruel’s planned museum deserves to succeed.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on remembering the Spanish civil war: the work must go on | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-remembering-the-spanish-civil-war-the-work-must-go-on
1/27/2022,"That noise? The sound of the bottom of the barrel being scraped. Boris Johnson not only degrades himself but the Tory backbenchers falling over themselves to defend him. Not so long ago, Conservative MPs could just about kid themselves there were no parties in Downing Street and that Big Dog’s integrity was intact. Now the game is long since up and no one even bothers to defend the lies. Apart from Chris Philp. He’ll repeat any nonsense he’s been told to say. Instead we get ever more improbable lines from Tory MPs, who seem to have forgotten The Suspect made the laws, The Suspect broke the laws and The Suspect lied about it. Mostly along the lines of “it was only a small bit of cake”, “it wasn’t really a party”, “it was a surprise so he couldn’t be expected to remember it” and “he’s done such a brilliant job we shouldn’t be too bothered if a little bit of law breaking went on inside No 10”.  The advocates of this last excuse have been excelling themselves. We’ve had Jacob Rees-Mogg as good as admitting he couldn’t think of anything Johnson might do that would cause him to reconsider his support. Conor Burns said The Suspect had been “ambushed with a cake”. That Colin the Caterpillar can be a right bastard. Then there was Andrew Rosindell telling Sky’s Kay Burley that “it wasn’t as if he had robbed a bank or anything”. Phew. It can’t be long before someone says “he hasn’t killed anyone, as far as I know”. In the end, this kind of feeble moral relativism drags everyone down to the bottom. But we are where we are. And come Wednesday lunchtime, MPs of all parties appeared to be in limbo as they waited for the Sue Gray report to land on No 10’s doorstep. So prime minister’s questions had the feel of the Phoney War as both leaders seemed to pull their punches, as if they were testing each other out for weaknesses before the real battle when the two went head to head in the Commons statement in the coming hours or days. Keir Starmer kept it simple at the start. Did the prime minister think the ministerial code – especially the section on knowingly misleading parliament – applied to him? The Suspect mumbled a quick, rather uncertain, “yes” before going on to say that he couldn’t possibly comment on matters that were the matter of a police investigation. Except he could if he wanted to. There was nothing stopping him giving a long and detailed explanation of how he was completely innocent of everything that had been alleged against him. Other than, of course, that it would have been yet another lie. Then who was counting? In which case, said the Labour leader, why didn’t The Suspect do everyone – Sue Gray and the police in particular – a favour and just resign now? In December he had said all guidance had been followed and that no parties had taken place. Now he wasn’t even bothering to pretend there had been parties, nor that he had attended them. So unless he was now pleading he had been in a fugue state for 18 months and had had no recollection of anything until Gray had reminded him, then clearly he had knowingly misled parliament. All that was missing as a coup de grace, was for Starmer to pass him a slice of cake. The Suspect smirked and toyed with his toddler haircut, determined to appear upbeat. As much for himself as the MPs on his backbenches on whom he was depending to prolong what was left of his career. He wanted at least to go down with a semblance of fight. All hope of going with dignity had long since passed. If he had had a conscience, he would have been up to his neck in shame. For him it was still all a big joke that the police were conducting a criminal investigation into the prime minister of the UK. What followed was a stream of unconsciousness. He rattled on about trying to stop Putin invade Ukraine, while Labour just focused on his unfortunate habit of lying about everything. Why was everyone making such a fuss about something so trivial? I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Big Dog believes he only lies because other people make him do it. It didn’t seem to have occurred to The Suspect that it was him and his government that had spent virtually every waking hour for the past two months trying to protect his own job. Nor was there any greater self-awareness as he went on to say he was cutting taxes – they were going up in April – and fixing the cost of living. Just as food and fuel prices were rising. He ended by declaring Starmer was “a lawyer not a leader”. In time he might come to realise that wasn’t such a killer line as he imagined. Not least because he might be needing the services of a top lawyer in the coming weeks. It’s also probable most voters would settle for a good lawyer running the country rather than a pathological fraud. The only thing he can be trusted with is to be untrustworthy. The Tory benches were rather louder in their support than they had been in the past two weeks. Though this was more for show than sincerity. Most would happily knife The Suspect in the front if they thought it would play to their advantage. The loyalty is barely even skin deep. Only Sheryll Murray delivered a full on love bomb to her leader. Which was as pathetic as it was touching. Johnson ended by claiming the difference between the Tories and Labour was that he had a vision. If he does, it’s a drug-induced one. The main difference between the two parties is that the Tories are knee-deep in their own shit. And still have no real idea how to get out of it.",News/Politics,"Labour had Boris Johnson over a barrel, but he could still scrape the bottom of it | John Crace",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/26/labour-had-boris-johnson-over-a-barrel-but-he-could-still-scrape-the-bottom-of-it
1/27/2022,"A First Nation in Canada says it has discovered 93 potential grave sites on the grounds of a former residential school. The chief and council of Williams Lake First Nation said that a preliminary search of St Joseph’s Mission Residential School had revealed “potential human burials” in a small portion of the school’s sprawling grounds.  “This journey has led our investigation team into the darkest recesses of human behaviour,” said Kúkpi7 (chief) Willie Sellars on Tuesday. The school operated in the province of British Columbia between 1891 and 1981 and has a dark history abuse. Many students ran away and others tried to kill themselves. One child died of exposure in the wilderness after fleeing. “At the time, the coroner’s service and RCMP saw no reason to investigate the death as the child was ‘only an Indian,’” he said. Sellars said the investigation had exacted a heavy on toll survivors. “Our team has recorded not only stories regarding the murder and disappearance of children and infants, they have listened to countless stories of systematic torture, starvation, rape and sexual assault of children at St Joseph’s Mission,” he said. The investigation found evidence of children’s bodies being disposed nearby rivers and lakes and evidence the school’s incinerator had been used to dispose of children, said Sellars. Murray Sinclair, who led the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, previously told the Guardian of similar stories. Canada’s legacy of residential schools has come under renewed scrutiny ever since the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc Nation announced last May that had discovered that was believed to be more than 200 unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School. Over more than a century, at least 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their families and forced to attend the schools, many of which were run by the Catholic church. Children were forcibly converted to Christianity, given new names and were prohibited from speaking their native languages. The last residential school closed in the 1990s. Only a portion of the 470 hectares have been searched. Of the 93 potential graves identified, 50 were outside the school’s cemetery said Whitney Spearing, the lead investigator. “It must be emphasized that no geophysical investigation can provide certainty into the presence of human remains,” she said. “Excavation is the only technique that will provide answers as to whether human remains are present.” Sellars said the community will hold discussions over whether or not to excavate the sites, a fraught question that many nations across the country are dealing with. But Tuesday’s announcement validates the stories of survivors, he said. “For decades there were reports of neglect and abuse at the St Joseph’s Mission, and worse, there were reports of children dying or disappearing from the facility,” he said.“For the bulk of St Joseph’s Mission’s history, these reports were at best given no credence.”",News/World news,Nearly 100 ‘potential human burials’ discovered at British Columbia school,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/nearly-100-potential-human-burials-discovered-british-columbia-school-indigenous-people
1/27/2022,"The government will take the BBC to court in March in an attempt to prevent it from publishing or broadcasting a proposed news report. Oliver Sanders QC, representing the attorney general Suella Braverman, told the high court on Wednesday that the case involved matters of national security and breach of confidence.  The Telegraph reported on Friday that the BBC was planning to reveal the identity of a spy working overseas, prompting comparisons with the Spycatcher saga. It is a rare example of breach of confidence claim being brought by the government against a media organisation. In 1987, the Thatcher government gagged newspapers in England from reporting on Peter Wright’s claims against MI5, contained in his autobiography, Spycatcher, which had been published in Australia. Given the sensitivity of the current case, Sanders requested that Wednesday’s hearing be held in private, telling the court: “In our submissions, the difficulty of proceeding in open court … is it makes it almost impossible to discuss the issue, in terms of what the case is about.” The BBC’s lawyer, Adam Wolanski, opposed the application for the hearing to be held in private, describing it as “a departure from the open justice principle”. Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled that it would be held partially in private but only for discussions surrounding the Telegraph story. As a result the press and public were excluded from the hearing for more than an hour. However, Chamberlain said he was committed to the case being heard in public where possible, saying: “The principle is not to derogate from open justice unless it is strictly necessary and compellingly justified. He added: “The interim relief hearing will take place on 1 and 2 March. It will take place in public until – and to the extent – there’s an order made that any part of the hearing should not be in public.” The judge also directed that a redacted version of the injunction application and claim form, which were previously sealed, can be made public on Thursday. Before the hearing, a spokesperson for the BBC said: “The attorney general has issued proceedings against the BBC with a view to obtaining an injunction to prevent publication of a proposed BBC news story. We are unable to comment further at this stage, beyond confirming that we would not pursue any story unless it was felt it was overwhelmingly in the public interest to do so and fully in line with the BBC’s editorial standards and values.” A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said: “The attorney-general has made an application against the BBC. It would be inappropriate to comment further while proceedings are ongoing.”",News/World news,BBC to be taken to court to stop it from reporting on spy story,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/bbc-to-be-taken-to-court-to-stop-it-from-reporting-on-spy-story
1/27/2022,"The lack of a widespread electric vehicle charging network in the UK is holding back the mass adoption of zero-emission cars, according to carmakers and industry analysts. This year is considered crucial for electric vehicles (EVs) going mainstream, but the German manufacturer Volkswagen has warned that a significant increase in the number of available chargers is needed to convince consumers to make the switch from petrol and diesel cars.  The UK government plans to ban sales of new cars with internal combustion engines from 2030, when ministers hope one in every three cars on Britain’s roads will be electric, compared with one in 100 currently. “The key thing now is to ensure that the charging infrastructure not just increases to meet the current demand, but accelerates to overtake the current demand,” said Alex Smith, the managing director of Volkswagen UK. “We’ve got to get the charging infrastructure ahead of the game to enable us to progress from the quite specific adoption that we have at the moment into mass adoption. And we’re not there yet.” Sales of EVs have soared in recent years, and almost doubled between 2020 and 2021, rising from 108,000 to 190,000, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). This meant that Britons bought more electric cars last year than during the previous five years combined. However, sales have been climbing from relatively low levels, and accounted for just under 12% of sales last year. “We’re already seeing that divergence between the acceleration rate of EV adoption and the supporting infrastructure that’s in place,” Smith said. “Pure EV sales increased by 76% last year. The charging infrastructure increased by about a third.” The UK arm of Volkswagen saw its EV sales double between 2020 and 2021. It has committed to investing €89bn (£74bn) in EVs over the next five years, as it tries to atone for its 2015 Dieselgate scandal. It was found to have rigged the emissions of cars to make them appear cleaner than they were. Its newest models, the all-electric ID3 and ID4, are manufactured at its plant in the German city of Zwickau – the first factory belonging to a volume carmaker to only build cars powered by lithium-ion batteries. Smith believes “range anxiety” among consumers – when drivers feared electric vehicles wouldn’t travel far enough on a single charge to get them where they needed to go – has now been replaced by “charging anxiety”. “When there is a certain density of public charging infrastructure in a particular area, EV sales started to climb almost exponentially in that area,” Smith said. “Ultimately, filling your car with electrons should be as convenient and as reliable as filling your car with a liquid fuel.” Problems finding chargers are a common gripe among EV drivers, who complain that even if they do find chargers during their journey, they may be in use or out of order. There is also huge variation in the number of chargers available in different parts of the UK. The UK is lagging behind its continental neighbours in this regard. At the start of the year, there were 28,375 public EV charging devices available in the UK, according to figures published by the Department for Transport. Fewer than 20% of these – only 5,156 – were rapid chargers. That is fewer than half of the 66,665 chargers that had already been installed in the Netherlands by 2021, and a third less than the 44,538 chargers found in Germany at that time, according to figures from the EU’s European Alternative Fuels Observatory. Car industry analysts believe the UK government needs to take responsibility for developing and funding the vehicle charging network. “We need fast chargers on main routes, we need destination chargers, we need on-street [schemes] for installing chargers at home. We need a really holistic approach,” said David Bailey, a professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. “We’ve not had that from the government.” Bailey is also critical of “premature” cuts to subsidies for electric vehicles made by ministers last year. This has been coupled with a delay in the government’s plans to force shops, factories and offices in England with large car parks to install at least one electric car charger. “The government isn’t going to do it all, but leadership is about trying to get a variety of different actors to move in the same direction, and harnessing not only central government, but also local government and private sector investment to make this happen. Really they have not done enough,” he said. Bailey believes a big investment in infrastructure is needed to get the UK where it wants to be by 2030, when compared with a country such as Norway, where more than half of cars sold are electric. “We have simply set a date and have not put in place the infrastructure to get us to that date,” he said. The Department for Transport’s electric vehicle infrastructure strategy was reportedly due last autumn, but has been delayed. A spokesperson for the department said: “The government is providing more than £1.3bn to support the continued roll-out of chargepoints at homes, businesses and on residential streets across the UK, levelling up our chargepoint provision while supporting the deployment of rapid chargepoints on motorways and major A roads in England.” ",News/Business,"UK electric vehicle charging network is lagging behind, says Volkswagen",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/uk-electric-vehicle-charging-network-is-lagging-behind-says-volkswagen
1/27/2022,"The owners of Peppa Pig, the rosy-cheeked $1bn global phenomenon, are suing a Vietnamese studio that has created a hugely popular YouTube series based on an animated family of wolves. Entertainment One (eOne), the formerly London-listed owner of Peppa Pig that was acquired by US toy firm Hasbro for £3.3bn in 2019, has filed an action against Sconnect at the high court in London in conjunction with Astley Baker Davies, the company formed by the creators of the children’s character.  The action, brought by the London-based law firm and intellectual property experts Brandsmiths, is for alleged “passing off and copyright infringement” relating to Sconnect’s library of thousands of YouTube videos and burgeoning merchandise business. The claim form, which gives brief details of the case, also alleges that Sconnect is in breach of six registered trademarks relating to the use of Peppa Pig’s name, images and references in its content to push its own kids franchises by association. The target of the legal action is Sconnect’s Wolfoo franchise, which revolves around the main character, Wolfoo, “a five-year-old little wolf living on a hill in a small American village” and her family and friends. Wolfoo has rapidly grown to become a major YouTube hit among the same demographic of two to eight-year-olds that catapulted Peppa into becoming one of the biggest preschool brands in the world. The legal action was first reported by Variety. Sconnect has three official Wolfoo YouTube channels, with close to 30 million subscribers who have access to thousands of the three-minute episodes available in languages from French to Bahasa, as well as other properties such as stop-motion series WOA Luka and 2-D animation Max’s Puppy. In a sponsored article, the company boasts that “Wolfoo is dominating YouTube for kids”, and says its whole portfolio of properties attracts 2.5bn online views per month. In online forums and articles Wolfoo is frequently referred to as similar to Peppa Pig. In 2019, eOne sued a number of individuals over counterfeit merchandise, in both China and its biggest market, the US, to protect its $1bn-plus annual toy sales. The loveable character, who hit the headlines in November when Boris Johnson referred to a trip to Peppa Pig World theme park in a “rambling” speech to business leaders at a ​​ Confederation of British Industry (CBI) event, first appeared in 2004 as a five-minute children’s animation on Channel 5 Peppa Pig, which is now broadcast in over 40 languages and is available in more than 180 territories worldwide, was created in 2000 by Mark Baker, Neville Astley and Phil Davies. The trio, who became friends working in the animation department of Middlesex Polytechnic in the mid-1980s, are now multimillionaires and have stepped away from the business.
