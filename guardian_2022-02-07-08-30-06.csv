2/7/2022,"It’s the start of a new week, morning tea, and you have found yourself on Five Great Reads, our summertime wrap of interest and entertainment, lovingly brewed by me, Alyx Gorman, Guardian Australia’s chai, chemises and calisthenics editor. If you’re after breaking news instead – parliament starts sitting this week, so there’s a lot of it – please head over to our live blog. And if you just want to know what’s happening with Australia’s first olympic curlers, they’re having a very wild ride. Otherwise, let’s get to the reads.  Between 2019’s protests and the heavy national security laws that followed and souring US-China relations, Hong Kong’s once freewheeling foreign business community is feeling mounting pressures. But, according to a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce, it’s the territory’s strict Covid rules that have 44% of their members considering an exit.

Three minutes In Hollywood films it’s not uncommon to see a leading man paired with a love interest a decade or two his junior, with no acknowledgement of the May-December dynamic in the script. But at Sundance this year, a spate of films deal explicitly with romantic age gaps, and the practice of casting young female actors with older men is beginning to draw ire. Could this spell a reckoning? Repeatable line: “Men on-screen have a whole life, and women only have a shelf life,” says Nicky Clark, the founder of campaign group Acting Your Age. Clark lobbies for age-appropriate casting and representation for older women on screen. “Since the medium began, women were expected to retire at 40 and not do anything particularly interesting if they were working after that age. And that hasn’t really changed.” How long will it take me to read? Three minutes Yesterday, Amanda Meade wrote that Australia’s longest running soap opera Neighbours is in peril, as the UK’s Channel 5 pulled the plug on the show in Britain. But what is it being replaced with? The answer is “programs about the royals, steam trains and almost anything with Yorkshire in the title”, apparently. What now? Well, Channel 5 is re-investing its Ramsey Street money in British properties instead. Such as? All Creatures Great and Small. Sounds familiar… Well, it’s a reboot of a beloved eighties series, and it is airing here on the ABC. Our critic also described it as “the television equivalent of taking your brain out and dunking it into a bucket of warm tea”. It is easy for criminals to get their hands on databases of names, phone numbers and dates of birth from the dark web. Increasingly, fraudsters are using these lists in concert with other information available online to impersonate people’s university-aged children. Why? Because it’s a very plausible way to ask for money.

Dodging storms and tsunami warnings, four weeks on a board in a seaside town proved those fears wrong.

2/7/2022,"Some of the world’s biggest businesses are failing to live up toclaims they will hit net-zero emissions targets, according to research that suggests they will cut their carbon emissions by only 40% rather than the 100% cuts claimed. Household names such as Amazon, Ikea, Nestlé and Unilever are among the companies named as showing little substance to their claims that they will cut emissions drastically.  Thomas Day of NewClimate Institute, who compiled the report, said that taken in aggregate, the efforts of the 25 companies studied would make little impact. “It is not clear these reductions take us beyond business as usual,” he said. “We were very disappointed and surprised at how much room for improvement there was [among the companies studied]. Companies need to be much more transparent about these goals.” Near-term targets were of particular concern, he added. The report showed that the companies surveyed would only cut their emissions by about 23% on average by 2030, falling far short of the figure of nearly halving in the next decade that scientists say is needed to limit global heating to 1.5C. “It’s short-term action that’s the most important thing, in the climate crisis,” he said. Many are relying on carbon offsetting for a large portion of their projected cuts. Carbon offsetting is the controversial practice of paying for projects that reduce carbon dioxide – usually by maintaining forests or growing new trees – to compensate for greenhouse gases emitted elsewhere. Many of the companies studied have made much of their public claims to environmental sustainability. “Some companies I had expected more from, given their very positive perception, such as Ikea, Unilever and Nestlé,” said Day. The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor, by NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch, scored companies on criteria including their targets, how much offsetting they planned to use and the reliability of those offsets, as well as progress on reducing their own emissions, and how transparent they were in their target-setting and corporate reporting. None of the 25 companies rated were judged to achieve a high standard according to these benchmarks. Among those showing “low integrity” were Amazon and Ikea, while the 11 companies that ranked worst in the study, showing “very low integrity”, included E.ON and Nestlé. The over-use of offsetting was one of the main reasons most companies were marked down, said Day. Offsetting is increasingly popular among companies seeking to burnish their green credentials, and is set to become even more so through a new standards body. Critics say that many offsetting projects have been found to be of doubtful value, and some have been fraudulent. Forestry also makes a poor substitute for immediate emissions cuts as carbon emitted into the atmosphere today begins to heat the atmosphere now and continues to do so for at least a century, while trees take decades to grow and store carbon absorbed from the air. Proponents counter that with deforestation rampant across the world, preserving existing forests is one of the most important ways of tackling the climate crisis. Day said using offsetting tended to obscure whether companies were making genuine progress on cutting their own emissions, or hiding behind offsets to achieve a notional net zero. “It’s better practice not to offset – it’s more transparent and constructive,” he said. “Companies should not be claiming they are net zero by 2030 unless they are reducing their emissions by 90% by then.” He was also concerned at the apparent poor quality of some of the offsetting projects that companies were using. “If they insist on offsetting, at least it should be with carbon credits that have more integrity,” he said. An Amazon spokesperson said the company had a goal of reaching net-zero carbon by 2040: “We set these ambitious targets because we know that climate change is a serious problem, and action is needed now more than ever. Amazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our original target.” An E.ON spokesperson said: “In our view, [the report] is not only methodologically incorrect, but its results are misleading. E.ON’s carbon footprint is based on the principles of the globally applicable greenhouse gas accounting standard. E.ON was again included in the A List by CDP [the Carbon Disclosure Project] for its climate reporting in 2021.” A spokesperson for Ikea said: “While Ikea has achieved much already, such as breaking the link between decreasing our absolute emissions while increasing business growth, we have plans in place to address our remaining complex challenges, such as the climate footprint of the materials used in the Ikea range.” Benjamin Ware, the global head of climate delivery and sustainable sourcing at Nestlé, said: “We welcome scrutiny of our actions and commitments on climate change. However, the report lacks understanding of our approach and contains significant inaccuracies. [Our] climate roadmap has been validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative [a corporate sustainability body]. The work that went into it is rigorous and extensive.” A spokesperson for Unilever said: “While we share different perspectives on some elements of this report, we welcome external analysis of our progress and have begun a productive dialogue with the NewClimate Institute to see how we can meaningfully evolve our approach.”",News/Environment,"World’s biggest firms failing over net-zero claims, research suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/06/amazon-ikea-nestle-biggest-carbon-net-zero-claims
2/7/2022,"It’s worth prioritising The Curse just to hear the voice Tom Davis does in it. He has written himself the part of hulking weirdo Mick, a grimy, pie-stealing cartoon of a man whose tank tops are four inches too short and whose anecdotes about sparring with George Foreman (“They call me into the ring, my old Aristotle’s going like a rabbit’s nose … you ever been kicked by a ’orse?”) are clearly fraudulent. But the voice! A fruity back-of-the-throat baritone with loose consonants bouncing off a lolling lower lip and splashing everywhere, like a cockney Bernard Ingham – it’s a thick extra layer of funny on an already very funny script, and it’s the sound of a man at the top of his character-comedy game. Davis and his long-term collaborator, co-writer/director James De Frond, are in a run of form that suggests they can do just about anything. After the cleverly marshalled absurdity of innovative BBC Three meta-comedy Murder in Successville, they skipped through one series of spy spoof Action Team on ITV2 before landing on BBC One with the perfectly formed suburban sitcom King Gary. Now, still insisting on launching each new project via a different channel and in a different genre, they switch to Channel 4 for period crime caper The Curse.  Set in a gorgeously rendered 1980s east London – a place of magnolia Formica, peeling paint on corrugated fencing, some beautiful painted signage and pints served in thick, dimpled glass mugs – The Curse tracks a gang of idiots as they conceive, plan and execute a heist for which they are drastically under-qualified. At the end of episode one, the incident that gives the rest of the series its narrative impetus takes place. Before that, this little world is lovingly constructed. Davis’s character Big Mick is merely an ensemble player. First we meet cafe owners Tash (Emer Kenny) and Albert (Allan Mustafa): her in the kitchen doing all the work; him front of house, forgetting customers’ orders and failing entirely to assert himself when visited by imposing local villain Joey (Abraham Popoola). Then Tash’s brother Sidney (Steve Stamp) brings news of his employment as a security guard in a warehouse where booty worth as much as £50,000 is apparently begging to be nicked. Over a few jars, Albert, Sidney and Mick, along with their other mate Phil (Hugo Chegwin), decide to go for it. For viewers who did not see People Just Do Nothing on BBC Three, it must look as if The Curse has somehow surrounded Davis with an array of skilled unknowns, all of them unfeasibly brilliant at playing deluded weaklings whose bravado cannot hide how adorably ineffectual they are. Albert is smart but too timid to speak up for himself, while Sidney means well but is a fragile man (“Yes, I can do pressups! I do 50 a week!”) who does not know when to stay stumm. Phil, meanwhile, is a wannabe gangster who entirely lacks the necessary air of authority. He’s got himself a trilby, but his boss Joey keeps knocking it off his head, and his effort to rebrand himself as “the Captain” hasn’t caught on. “No one calls you that, Phil,” Tash wearily tells him. “You can’t just give yourself a nickname.” Those who did see People Just Do Nothing, who know that Mustafa, Stamp and Chegwin all wrote and starred in it together as deluded weaklings running a shambolic pirate radio station, will know that the trio have spent five seasons of their show honing the dynamic that powers any number of great sitcoms: men whose opinion of themselves is hopelessly at odds with obvious reality. Davis, himself a master at offsetting his chunky 6ft 7in frame by playing fretful softies, has spotted kindred spirits and formed some kind of sitcom supergroup. The scene with the four of them around the pub table is just sublime: while the People Just Do Nothing trio do their finely calibrated routine about blokes who are endlessly peeved by their friends’ foibles while being unable to see their own, Davis enjoys himself hugely as the random factor Mick. “I’m in! I’m all over it! Fifty thousand grand!” In its execution, though, The Curse is less traditional sitcom and more swinging Britflick, with De Frond deploying kinetic split screens, shiny old cars rolling vertically through shots, and Camille Coduri as a reflective, all-seeing narrator. There’s a lovely nod to the old Reservoir Dogs/Taking of Pelham One Two Three motif where criminals assign themselves colours – based on snooker balls, in this case – and all the right tunes by the Cult, Talk Talk, Talking Heads and the The on the soundtrack. Davis and De Frond seem primed to move on to movies before too long – with The Curse, they continue to make fabulous TV comedy look easy.",Arts/Television & radio,The Curse review – a sublime crime caper with an unfeasibly brilliant cast,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/06/the-curse-review-a-sublime-caper-with-an-unfeasibly-brilliant-cast
2/7/2022,"Carrie Johnson has denied that she has any role in shaping government policy and claimed she has been targeted by enemies of the prime minister in a “brutal campaign”. Boris Johnson’s wife took the unusual step of issuing a statement through her spokesperson on Sunday evening after months of claims that she is a “Lady Macbeth” figure behind government decision-making in Downing Street.  It has been alleged that she was influential in the decision to allow the evacuation of animals from the Nowzad charity from Kabul as the city fell to the Taliban in August 2021, while thousands who had worked with British forces were left behind. No 10 has denied either Boris or Carrie Johnson had any involvement in the evacuation. There has also been criticism over her possible role in the redecorating of their Downing Street flat, where interior designer Lulu Lytle used gold wallpaper that cost £840 a roll. Allies have dismissed the allegations as sexist. A spokesperson for Carrie said on Sunday: “Yet again Mrs Johnson has been targeted by a brutal briefing campaign against her by enemies of her husband. “This is just the latest attempt by bitter ex-officials to discredit her. She is a private individual who plays no role in government.” The Sunday Times reported on Sunday that she had privately said the prime minister should resign, as unhappiness among Conservative backbenchers caused by the “partygate” allegations shows no sign of going away. Since the stories broke the Tories have fallen behind Labour in the polls. It added that she had grown weary of the pressure on her and her family after recent revelations. The Tory peer Michael Ashcroft, who has written a new biography of the 33-year-old, claimed on Sunday that she was hindering the prime minister’s ability to lead Britain “as effectively as the voters deserve”. Carrie Johnson was previously a Conservative party official and worked for Zac Goldsmith, Sajid Javid and John Whittingdale. She has been a vocal supporter of environmental and animal rights causes. She moved into Downing Street with the prime minister when he took office in July 2019, and they have since got married and had two children.",News/UK news,Carrie Johnson says she has been targeted by ‘brutal campaign’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/06/carrie-johnson-says-she-has-been-targeted-by-brutal-campaign
2/7/2022,"David Moyes has said he is concerned that international duty could take its toll on Michail Antonio. The West Ham striker missed their FA Cup extra-time win at Kidderminster on Saturday because he was flying back from Jamaica, for whom he started three World Cup qualifiers in seven days, one in Panama City, in which he scored a penalty. Moyes has criticised the schedule and said he is worried the long-haul travel could prove detrimental.  Antonio is Moyes’s only senior recognised striker after the manager failed to add to his squad in January. Jarrod Bowen led the line in Antonio’s absence at sixth-tier Kidderminster and, despite scoring the winning goal in the final minute of extra time, West Ham lacked a focal point. The 31-year-old instead trained on Saturday after returning to London late on Friday following defeat to Costa Rica, which ended Jamaica’s hopes of qualifying for Qatar 2022. “He has been away a couple of times now and I’ve had concerns about it, yes, because it is new to him,” Moyes said. “It is not something he has been doing it since he was 21 or 22 or something like that. Obviously they are long travels if you’re going to Jamaica … they’re long journeys to play the games. But I’ll never stop anybody if they want to play for their chosen country.” Antonio, who was an unused substitute for England under Sam Allardyce in 2016, made his Jamaica debut last year and in March he is expected to be called up for another triple-header of matches. The forward is set to return to West Ham’s starting lineup when they host Watford in the Premier League on Tuesday. Moyes introduced Declan Rice and Craig Dawson at half-time at Aggborough but Kurt Zouma and Bowen ended up playing 121 minutes. “I quite like the boys playing extra time because it makes 90 minutes a lot easier once you’ve played 120,” said Moyes, whose side were handed a trip to Southampton in the fifth round draw. “I’m quite happy, maybe get them back into better shape. They had a week off and maybe they needed it, so hopefully it gets them in better condition. The biggest thing now is [that] the players make sure they get back to the levels they can show.”",Sport/Football,David Moyes concerned Jamaica duty taking toll on Michail Antonio,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/david-moyes-concerned-jamaica-duty-taking-toll-on-michail-antonio-west-ham
