2/2/2022,"Could human urine be liquid gold for horticulturists? A new trial is examining if “number one” could be a cheap and sustainable source of fertiliser for plants and lawns in Australia’s city parks.  The study, by Griffith University, aims to find out if “urine diversion toilets” being trialled in Brisbane and Sydney, might stop valuable excretions of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen from disappearing down the S-bend. “It’s the perfect liquid gold and currently we just flush it down the toilet,” associate professor Cara Beal, of Griffith University’s Cities Research Institute, said. Beal said the four-year project would investigate different toilet designs and incorporate new technology developed by a University of Melbourne chemical engineer. Human urine is sterile, but can also contain undesirables such as pathogens, hormones and antibiotics that need to be processed. “But the good stuff is the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that plants love. The technology is important, but that’s not the barrier to closing that nutrient loop and reusing our most precious resource we generate,” Beal said. “We have the technology. The issue is looking at the regulatory approvals and getting our health and planning departments to understanding this.” The trial is part of an initiative known as Nutrients in a Circular Economy being led by the University of Technology Sydney and including other universities, such as Griffith, and commercial and government partners. The trial will look at any health risks from using human urine, as well as investigating how it stacks up economically as a source of fertiliser. Potential sites in parks in Brisbane and Sydney had been identified, but there were still consultations and regulatory approvals to be negotiated, Beal said. Toilets could be installed by the end of this year. Beal said generating nitrogen was energy intensive and phosphorus was a finite resource that was mined. She said: “As a society, if we are to get to net zero carbon emissions we are going to have to move away from synthetic fertilisers.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tackling the community’s instinctive “yuck factor” would also be part of social studies to be carried out under the trial. The trial will use technology being developed by Dr Stefano Freguia, a chemical engineer at the University of Melbourne who has designed a self-powering system using electrical charges and membranes to separate the valuable elements from urine. “It’s one of several technologies that have been developed over the last 10 years. We have used human waste since the beginning of time, but recently we have become justifiably picky,” he said, saying modern life had added contaminants such as pharmaceutical products and pathogens to our human waste stream. “Our lifestyles have changed. This technology we’re developing needs to address this,” he said. He said the liquid fertiliser produced by the technology – which can be as small as a 20cm cube depending on the volume needed – has a smell of ammonia “which isn’t so hard on our noses” as human urine.

2/2/2022,"Scientists are developing a “revolutionary” test to predict a woman’s risk of four cancers using a single sample collected during cervical screening. Using cervical cells from a routine smear test, experts may be able to spot ovarian and breast cancer or predict their likelihood of developing, according to two papers published in the journal Nature Communications. Further results are due on the ability of the WID-test – women’s cancer risk identification – to predict womb and cervical cancer, researchers said.  The test could eventually enable earlier detection of all four cancers in younger women, and even “stop cancer before it starts”, experts said, which would be a “game changer” for women’s health. “This could create a step change in screening for key cancers – not detecting them early but preventing them from developing,” said Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal, which is funding the research with the European Research Council. “Creating a new screening tool for the four most prevalent cancers that affect women and people with gynae organs – particularly the ones which are currently most difficult to detect at an early stage – from a single test could be revolutionary.” Ovarian cancer is responsible for the largest proportion of deaths associated with gynaecological cancers. Currently, 75% of ovarian cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, when the tumours have spread. Being able to detect the disease earlier may improve treatment outcomes. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is usually detected using mammography followed by a biopsy. “This research is incredibly exciting,” said Liz O’Riordan, a breast cancer surgeon who has herself been diagnosed with the disease. “At the moment there is no screening test for breast cancer in women under the age of 50. If this test can help pick up women with a high risk of developing breast, ovarian, cervical and uterine cancer at younger age, it could be a game changer.” Researchers used cervical cell samples from 242 women with ovarian cancer and 869 without. They then measured 14,000 epigenetic changes and identified a unique DNA signature that could be used to spot or predict the presence of ovarian cancer. This enabled them to identify 71.4% of women under 50 and 54.5% of women over 50 with ovarian cancers with 75% specificity. The findings were further validated in an additional cohort of women, where 47 had ovarian cancer and 227 did not. In the second study, researchers analysed epigenetic changes in cervical cell samples from 329 women with breast cancer with a poor prognosis and 869 women without the disease. They were able to identify women with breast cancer based on a unique epigenetic signature. The finding was confirmed in a smaller set of samples from 113 breast cancer patients and 225 women without breast cancer. “Our studies have taken a completely novel approach and evaluate an individual’s risk for more than one cancer by assessing several different epigenetic footprints in a single cervical screening sample,” said Prof Martin Widschwendter, of the University of Innsbruck and UCL, who is leading the research. “The WID-test will look for the footprints on a woman’s DNA as she goes through life, recording the track she is taking and whether she is heading towards cancer. The WID-test will revolutionise screening and enable a more personalised approach to cancer prevention and detection, where women will be screened, monitored or treated based on their individual, and changing, risk.” In the future, the Eve Appeal said, women could get separate risk scores for each of the four cancers. Those with high scores could be offered more active monitoring, regular mammograms, risk-reducing surgery, or therapeutics, the charity said. Widschwendter cautioned that further research and large-scale prospective clinical trials would be needed to confirm the tests could effectively predict the likelihood of women developing cancer. Health minister Maria Caulfield said it was “great to see how this new research could help alert women who are at higher risk to help prevent breast, ovarian, womb and cervical cancer before it starts”. In the meantime, cervical screening remained vital, she added and urged all women aged 25 and above to attend their appointments when invited.",News/Society,Scientists developing single test to detect risk of four cancers in women,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/scientists-developing-single-test-to-detect-risk-of-four-cancers-in-women
2/2/2022,"Ministers spent almost £9bn on personal protective equipment which was either substandard, defective, past its use-by date or dramatically overpriced, according to figures released on Monday. The Department of Health and Social Care paid £12bn while emergency-buying PPE for the UK in the year to 31 March 2021, its annual accounts show. Tonnes of items bought for £2.6bn were never usable by the NHS – this figure is now £2.7bn – and a further £670m worth of PPE was not usable at all in any healthcare setting.  This was mostly because it was defective, the annual report stated, and items costing £750m passed their safe date before they could be used. However, by far the biggest figure is the £4.7bn amounting to the difference between the dramatically inflated prices the DHSC paid for PPE to fill the UK’s tiny stockpile, and the value of that equipment now. The accounts, compiled by the National Audit Office, do not identify to where that extra £4.7bn was paid, whether in increased prices charged by PPE factories, mainly in China, or in significant profits made by UK companies and their intermediaries. Gareth Davies, the NAO’s comptroller and auditor general, also noted that PPE procurement had been vulnerable to fraud, as normal competitive tender processes were suspended and multimillion-pound contracts awarded to many companies with no previous experience. As much of the equipment supplied remains in sealed containers, Davies said he had been unable to carry out sufficient checks to be satisfied that substantial fraud had not taken place. “The level of fraud risk has increased as a result of Covid-19-related procurement,” he stated. “A significant increase in new suppliers, a lack of timely checks on the quality of goods received and poor inventory management all contributed to this heightened risk. In these circumstances … I have not been able to obtain assurance that there has not been a material level of losses due to fraud.” Davies’s cautionary note on possible PPE fraud follows the resignation last week of the former Cabinet Office minister Theodore Agnew, who complained of “arrogance, indolence and ignorance” in the government’s attitude to tackling fraud, after £4.3bn fraudulently claimed in Covid loans was written off. The DHSC accepted in the annual report that its PPE procurement was susceptible to “heightened risk” of fraud, as “goods subject to detailed technical requirements were purchased from new suppliers … some of whom did not have experience in supplying these types of product”. The department justified its processes, however, saying it had to act quickly to buy “scarce resource amidst a global pandemic”, and was confident in its anti-fraud precautions including financial checks on suppliers and payment on delivery. “In the department’s view, these factors give assurance that the possibility of significant levels of fraud existing in respect of PPE inventory purchasing is remote,” the DHSC said. The government’s frantic process to replenish an empty stockpile of PPE has since become one of the most severely criticised elements of its pandemic response. Last month the high court ruled in favour of a legal challenge by the Good Law Project that the “VIP lane,” which gave high priority to companies with political connections, was unlawful. Companies with many years experience supplying the NHS complained they were ignored by the procurement process, while some people with no previous PPE experience but with Conservative party connections were awarded multimillion-pound contracts. The NAO has previously reported that companies referred to the VIP lane by Conservative ministers, MPs and peers or government officials had a success rate for contracts 10 times greater than companies dealt with in the other procurement route. Labour’s Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said of the DHSC accounts: “These levels of waste destroy any claim the Conservatives have to be careful stewards of the public finances. “Along with the government’s laissez-faire attitude to fraud, this will be particularly galling to hard-working households wondering how they will pay the higher taxes the chancellor is imposing this April.” The government has consistently justified its procurement during the pandemic by pointing to the quantities of PPE it did succeed in supplying to the NHS and other healthcare settings.",News/Politics,Department of Health writes off £9bn spent in UK Covid PPE drive,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/department-of-health-writes-off-9bn-spent-in-uk-covid-ppe-drive
2/2/2022,"A British Airways jet had a near-miss when the pilot was forced to abort a landing attempt at Heathrow airport as it was buffeted by high winds during Storm Corrie. Footage captured by plane spotters on Monday showed the jet, which had departed from Aberdeen, sway heavily on to its left side as it approached the runway.  The video, shown on Big Jet TV, showed the plane almost toppling on to its side as its tail appeared to make contact with the ground, creating a cloud of what aviation enthusiasts call plane dust. The pilot managed to steady the jet and pull it up before flying off for another - successful – landing attempt. In the video, witnesses can be heard gasping in horror as the tail looked to make contact in a “tail strike”. The plane appeared to rock from side to side before leaning heavily on to its left side before pulling clear. A British Airways spokesperson said of the incident on Monday: “Our pilots are highly trained to manage a range of scenarios, including extreme weather conditions, and our flight crew landed the aircraft safely. Our customers and crew all disembarked as normal.” Back-to-back storms at the weekend left more than 45,000 homes without electricity across the country. A nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire and a 60-year-old woman in Aberdeen died after trees were torn down on Saturday as Storm Malik took hold. Storm Corrie brought winds of 92mph to Stornoway in the Western Isles of Scotland late on Sunday before pushing into the North Sea in the early hours of Monday, leaving behind cold and blustery conditions.",News/UK news,BA jet in near-miss at Heathrow after landing aborted in high winds,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/ba-jet-in-near-miss-at-heathrow-after-landing-aborted-in-high-winds
2/2/2022,"Tom Brady was always going to leave on his own terms. “When I suck, I’ll retire,” Brady said in 2014. But of all his achievements, the timing of Brady’s announcement that he will step away from the game after 22 seasons may be the most remarkable of all. He is not walking away because injuries sapped his greatness or because his play has declined as he approaches the age of 45. Brady is coming off two seasons in Tampa in which he was still one of the best players in the NFL and clinched his seventh Super Bowl in his 10th appearance. He still moves as well as he ever. Remarkably, there is more zip on his fastball now than there was six years ago.  No, he is walking away because, in middle age, there is a life for him beyond football. “I said this a few years ago, it’s what relationships are all about,” Brady said last week on his Let’s Go! podcast. “It’s not always what I want. It’s what we want as a family.” He is walking away because his three children aged quicker than his game; because he wants to build a clothing brand before he starts creaking. The NFL will not be the same without Brady. He has presided over the top of the sport – a droning, nagging, staple of excellence – for 20 years. He retires as the most successful player to ever grace the league. The early portion of his career cemented his legacy: the overlooked, disrespected kid, drafted 199th overall, who grew to become the biggest sports star in America. He spent the second third of his career chasing – and surpassing – the legends of the game. And the final third chasing himself – seeing how much distance he could put between himself, the legends of the past and the legends to come. It was a self-dubbed battle of Tom v Time, one man against the concept of aging. By the end, he was lapping the field. Before he turned 37 in 2014, Brady was already one of the greatest quarterbacks in history. Whether he was the greatest at that point was debatable. There was Brady’s ruthless efficiency; Joe Montana’s perfection; Peyton Manning’s dominance; Dan Marino’s genius. Pick your flavor. Since then, Brady has added a further six MVP-caliber seasons and four more Super Bowl titles to his resume. He built stacked one Hall of Fame career on top of the other. He threw more touchdown passes in his 40s than he did in his 20s. No athlete, in any sport, has ever aged this way. The records speak for themselves. Brady will retire top of the NFL in: Wins: 243 Super Bowl titles: 7 Passing touchdowns: 624 Passing yards: 84,520 Starts: 316 Playoff wins: 35 Playoff passing yards: 13,049 Playoff touchdowns: 86 Game-winning drives in the playoffs: 14 Most passing yards in a playoff game: 505 Touchdown passes in the Super Bowl: 21 Passing yards in Super Bowls: 3,039 Super Bowl MVPs: 5 The volume of fans who enjoyed the early story, grew tired of his success, were happy when he failed, accused him of cheating, and grew to grudgingly respect his persistence and excellence: Infinite On and on the records roll. In all, Brady has appeared in 18% of Super Bowls ever played. There is no longer scope for debate. There is Brady, a stretch of highway, then everyone else. His perception of success has warped the very meaning of ‘winning’ in the NFL: a couple of Super Bowl runs is no longer enough. Legends are built on stories, and it’s the story that pushes Brady beyond all challengers. He went from an overlooked college quarterback selected as the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft to a pillar of arguably the most successful sports dynasty in modern sport. Along with head coach Bill Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft, Brady’s New England Patriots ruled the NFL for 20 years, defying a league in which the salary cap and draft are designed to ensure no team dominates for too long. And then came the divorce. Brady, Belichick, and Kraft separated. Like so many New Englanders before him, Brady entered middle age eying retirement in Florida. Two seasons in Tampa yielded 24 wins and 88 touchdowns. Another Lombardi Trophy on the mantle – maybe the most personally gratifying, a title all of his own away from Belichick and the Patriots infrastructure. Brady built his legend despite never being the greatest athlete on the field. A photo of his unimpressive physique (by the standards of a professional athlete, at least) coming out of college became famous, and he didn’t lost speed as he got older because he didn’t have much to lose in the first place. His game was based on uncommon accuracy and decision-making. His own standards were exacting; completing passes wasn’t enough, they had to be completed in the right spot. “The word ‘accurate’ means that if the ball is supposed to be thrown to the receiver’s right number, that is where the ball is thrown,” Belichick told author Michael Holley. “It does not get thrown to his left number.” Belichick demanded perfection, and Brady delivered. While other quarterbacks could create magic on the fly, relying on their physical gifts to extend plays or launch balls downfield, Brady prided himself on unceasing efficiency. He was monotonous. Hit the back foot, get the ball out. Again and again – 111,137 times all told. By the end, neither lineman nor lawyer could stop him. He knew every defense, and could uncrack any opposing defensive scheme with ease. Brady played for a decade longer than even his most durable contemporaries, and yet it still feels like he is stepping away a year or two early, that he could comfortably return next year and pilot another team towards a championship. With a year left on his contract with the Bucs, there was the thought that Brady could return for a farewell tour. But to what end? His legacy was set in New England, and confirmed in Tampa. He is the greatest there has ever been – perhaps the greatest there ever will be. He played in four distinctive generations, and conquered them all.

2/2/2022,"Euphoria, the slick, explicit, high-budget teen drama halfway through its second season on HBO, has from the start been a soap layered in heady seriousness. The show, adapted by Sam Levinson from an Israeli series of the same name and co-produced by Drake, took on a near encyclopedia of Today’s Teen Issues – sex shaming, drug addiction, body insecurity, web personas, revenge porn, pregnancy and abortion, emotional abuse, toxic masculinity, self-harm and depression, and more – with a bracing, revelatory frankness and thick lacquer of gloss (and full-frontal nudity).  By its first season finale in 2019, in which main character Rue (Zendaya, who won an Emmy for the role) nearly dies in a graphic drug overdose, Euphoria had drawn a legion of fans (the finale drew 1.2 million night-of viewers and became HBO’s most second-most tweeted-about series ever, behind Game of Thrones) and managed to balance shock with sensitivity. It established beloved characters – in particular the fragile, alchemical bond between Rue and Jules (Hunter Schafer), a trans character – as well as a distinctive visual palette: saturated color, shimmery beats, high-voltage fantasy, meta narration, a zeitgeist-aiming show with a small hint of irony and a large dollop of excess. The long-anticipated second season, which premiered in January and opened with a brash, 10-minute, Scorsese-style sequence on drug dealer Fezco’s (Angus Cloud) gun-toting criminal grandmother (played by The Sopranos’ Kathrine Narducci), has leaned even more to that excess, to a divisive degree. The ratings are up – 10.3 million people have watched the season premiere, and this week’s episode was up 41% from the week before – but reception is mixed. Online reactions toggle chaotically between sincere enjoyment and hate-watching or, for many, something inarticulably in between. The chasm between real high school (boring) and Euphoria high school (increasingly unhinged) has become distractingly vast, a joke turned into its own TikTok meme on its peacocking fashion. Whereas the first season felt like submerging, high, in a warm bath of high-school memories shot through with glitter, dialed up to 11, and distorted in a funhouse mirror, the second season – self-indulgent, luridly violent, still lush, expensively soundtracked – has taken on the feeling of a chore. Euphoria feels stuck – a stressful, self-conscious drag. Take, for instance, one of its signature fantasy sequences early in this season’s third episode, in which Rue delivers a monologue on her character’s wearying relapse with drug addiction, a downward spiral that has tested fans’ morale and provided one half of the season’s loose amalgamation of plot. “As a beloved character that a lot of people are rooting for, I feel a certain responsibility to make good decisions,” she says to the camera, pointer in hand, miming a schoolteacher instructing on the ABCs of hiding a relapse from friends and family. “Now, in all fairness, I did say from the beginning that I had no intention of staying clean. But I get it. Our country’s dark and fucked up and people just want to find hope. Somewhere. Anywhere. If not in reality, then in television. “Unfortunately,” she adds, without apology, “I’m not it.” It’s a fascinating meta moment – Levinson explaining, via Rue, why he’s testing the limits of her likability; the show itself acknowledging that it’s not really successful escapism, nor trying to be. It also feels like an admission of viewers’ fatigue with Rue’s addiction, which has drawn the season into near gang movie territory. Euphoria, like its floundering main character, has shirked the teen plot. This is not to complain that Euphoria is ridiculous, because ridiculousness is part and parcel of the teen soap genre, of which this show, despite its HBO pedigree, is a part. It’s probably best summarized, as the writer Molly Lambert put it, as “just A24 Degrassi”. (A24, the independent entertainment company behind such stylized, visually saturated features as Spring Breakers, Moonlight, Midsommar and Uncut Gems, also produces Euphoria.) It shares many tried and true staples of shows like Dawson’s Creek, One Tree Hill, The OC, Gossip Girl, Degrassi, Skins, Australian staples like Home and Away and Neighbours, including: an outsider who is still strikingly beautiful (in Euphoria, the second season character of Lexi, played by Maude Apatow); a love triangle involving a blonde and a brunette (Cassie, Maddy and Nate – the second season’s other contorted plot); at least one lost parent; uncontrolled house parties, obviously. All of these beloved teen shows were powered by consistent, cyclical melodrama and sustained by an implicit suspension of disbelief (that older actors at all resembled pimply teens, that teens were either having no sex at all or incredibly good sex, etc.) Ridiculousness can be extremely entertaining, as in any of the aforementioned shows or even in unintentionally chaotic series such as Apple TV’s The Morning Show. But when not harnessed to character development, plot momentum, or narrative pay-off, it feels self-indulgent, grating, even flat. Teen show violence isn’t unique to Euphoria – think a school shooting plot on Degrassi, that and more on One Tree Hill, even an ill-conceived murder-as-self-defense-from-rape plot-line on Friday Night Lights. But whereas those shows incorporated genuinely farfetched (and traumatic!) events for the sake of plot, suspense and drama, Euphoria increasingly appears to do so for the sake of aesthetics. The show has always toed the line between style and substance, and this season crossed into the former. An addict side character shooting up outside an LA suburbs motel, Rue strip-searched by a menacing dealer in a shower, Fezco pummeling Nate’s (Jacob Elordi) face, the camera lingering on the blood and crunch of his nose – all of it feels, in Euphoria’s lurid, hyper-real style, queasy and too much, explicitness spoilt to exploitation. The show is, by genre definition, ridiculous, but not in on the joke of its own excess. There are parts of Euphoria that felt genuinely refreshing – a nuanced portrayal of one teenage girl’s (Kat, played by Barbie Ferreira) foray into the mazy morass of internet sex; the introduction of Jules (Schafer), a trans girl whose transness is neither the point of her character nor the source of her demons; the too often manic pixied Jules’s gravitational, consuming connection with Rue. The show’s at times unsparing and deglamorized handling of Rue’s addiction was refreshing if gutting; same, too, for its depiction of sex as a curious, high-stakes battleground between the girls and boys. Euphoria, at its best, approaches the concerns of today’s teens (and parents) with revelatory candor, even at its most laughably and delightfully outlandish. But this season has catered to its worst, bloodiest impulses – ones it could use some good old teenage soap to wash out.",Arts/Television & radio,Coming down: why has shock teen show Euphoria become such a drag?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/01/euphoria-season-two-hbo-flat-drag
2/2/2022,"Jim White’s yellow tie was nowhere to be seen. WhatsApp long ago killed the artifice of having two mobile phones on the desk. Fans hanging around a training ground to cheer a new signing in bovine fashion is just another casualty of Covid-19. Things ain’t what they used to be. But, as it SLAMMED SHUT, The Fiver had to admit that January 2022’s transfer window had actually been almost interesting. Of the big boys, Manchester City signed the new Sergio Agüero/Vicente Matías Vuoso in Julián Álvarez. Liverpool landed Luis Díaz and will probably go back in this summer for Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho, despite paperwork not being complete in time. Chelsea signed nobody. Manchester United shed Anthony Martial but Jesse Lingard was kept on.  The battle at the bottom rests on whether Newcastle got their pants pulled down in spending £85m of Saudi loot on Kieran Tripper, Chris Wood, Bruno Guimarães and Dan Burn, with Matt Targett loaned in from Villa. At Watford, Mr Roy must make do with the regen talents the Pozzo family expected Claudio Ranieri to do better with. Norwich bought nobody, their sole deadline-day business the loaning of heavy Pantene user Todd Cantwell to Bournemouth. And with Wood cashed in, Burnley can now get it launched to Dutch man-mountain Wout Weghorst. There’s Frank Lampard’s The Ev, of course, keeping up proud club traditions by acting as a repository for fallen talent in borrowing Donny van de Beek and signing Dele Alli. Will that be enough to reach the heights of 13th? A club needs ambitions, after all, something unhappy Hammers are wailing after David Moyes added precisely zilch to his squad. The cries of “spend some effing money” are yet louder at Arsenal, louder even than at Tottenham, two Juventus players to the good and with Antonio Conte placated for this week at least. A thin squad unable to fulfil its fixtures a couple of weeks ago shed even more players, with Calum Chambers joining Villa. Then there’s Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang, who while taking what his people called a “family holiday” in the Catalan capital, somehow ended up becoming a Barcelona player. What are the chances? For a while, a 2022 reboot of the Peter Odemwingie caper, using private jet rather than Range Rover, looked on the cards. Aubameyang has joined Barcelona, less than a club, now more a Catalan recreation of ‘Arry Redknapp’s Portsmouth of the late-2000s, where top, top players turn up for no particular reason despite finances being tighter than The Fiver’s dungarees after another lockdown Christmas. Chambers and Aubameyang joined a list of Sokratis, Shkodran Mustafi, Sead Kolašinac, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Mesut Özil in being given Mikel Arteta’s ice-cold shoulder. That lot cost £194m, Arsenal receiving nowt from a transfer strategy that resembles a market stall handing out freebies at closing time. “My gang & I have hit a path and we won’t stop until we’re in every stomach and baked in every oven at some point!

Tyler Rattray, the captain of Raith Rovers’ women’s team, has resigned and crime writer Val McDermid has ended her sponsorship in protest at the signing of David Goodwillie, who was found to have raped a woman by a civil court in 2017. “This shatters any claim to be a community or family club,” said McDermid. “Goodwillie has never expressed a shred of remorse for the rape he committed. His presence at Starks Park is a stain on the club. I’ll be tearing up my season ticket too. This is a heartbreaker for me and many other fans, I know.” The PFA has warned there is still much to be done to achieve parity between male and female players, despite “significant” changes to new contracts for the women’s game. Meanwhile, the NWSL has agreed a collective bargaining agreement with the players’ association that includes a minimum salary of €35,000. Aaron Ramsey says that he chose to join the Pope’s Newc O’Rangers because they’re dead big. “I had a number of offers on the table, but none matched the magnitude of this club,” cooed the on-loan Juve midfielder. Barça chief suit Joan Laporta has directed another lazer beam of blame at his predecessor Josep Bartomeu for the club’s sorry financial state. “Our audit found payments that we understand were improper management of club funds,” he blabbed, handing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang €1 and an official Barcelona pen as payment for his first day’s work. Cork City defender Cathal Heffernan, 16, has only gone and signed for Milan. “Words can’t describe how happy I am,” cheered the defender who was born one month before this. Takumi Minamino and Junya Ito fired home the goals as Japan beat Saudi Arabia 2-0 to boost their own – and flamin’ Australia’s – hopes of qualifying for the Human Rights World Cup. Dele Alli can’t wait to take his flask and lunchbox to Finch Farm to start work at Frank Lampard’s Everton. “I’m eager to get started and can’t wait for my first game in a [Frank Lampard’s] Everton shirt,” cheered the midfielder, who will cost between £10m and £40m depending on how useful he is in said shirt.

2/2/2022,"Towards the end of her life, Christian broadcaster and recording star Tammy Faye Bakker, wife of disgraced televangelist and fraudster Jim Bakker, achieved a kind of camp redemption in an archly celebratory documentary released in 2000 called The Eyes of Tammy Faye, narrated by RuPaul. She was praised for her courage in supporting the LGBT community and people with Aids in the 80s, defying the homophobia of the Christian right in Ronald Reagan’s America. The film suggested a kind of martyrdom for Tammy Faye, drawn into her husband’s mess. The title was about her permanent eyeliner and liquid mascara but with a cheeky hint that like Laura Mars in the famous horror movie, she saw things that involved her – sure – but for which she couldn’t be held responsible.  The documentary has now been turned into a feature film starring Jessica Chastain who gives a hilarious turn as Tammy Faye: like Tammy Wynette with a bit of Nancy Reagan and Eva Perón. She is a devoutly Christian young woman who falls in love at bible college with the charming but slippery Jim, excellently played by Andrew Garfield. Creepy Jimmy has a free-and-easy way with other believers’ money and he ruthlessly gouges his TV flock for donations with which he builds up a Christian entertainment empire and lavish personal lifestyle. He fathers two children with Tammy Faye, but is reluctant to “snuggle” with her, preferring to blow off steam by rough-housing with his male assistant. The film also persuasively suggests that the famous TV preacher Rev Jerry Falwell (Vincent D’Onofrio) deliberately fanned the flames of the media scandal which brought the Bakkers down, so that he could step in and take over their media empire. This very enjoyable biopic skates over the matter of Jim’s #MeToo scandal: he was accused of rape by a female assistant and church money was used in an attempt to buy her off. Jim denied the allegation; the film doesn’t use the R-word and implies that it was just a matter of infidelity, perhaps to prevent Tammy Faye’s LGBT-ally status from being contaminated. Despite this issue, Chastain’s performance remains outrageously entertaining.  The Eyes of Tammy Faye is released on 4 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Eyes of Tammy Faye review – Jessica Chastain is outrageously entertaining in Christian biopic,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/the-eyes-of-tammy-faye-review-jessica-chastain-is-outrageously-entertaining-in-christian-biopic
2/2/2022,"Nicola Sturgeon has called on the prime minister to tackle the corrupting influence of Russian oligarchs in London’s financial industry and the Conservative party, suggesting that his inaction has directly contributed to Vladimir Putin’s sense of impunity over Ukraine. As Boris Johnson flew to Kyiv on Tuesday – in a show of solidarity and with hopes of distracting from the continuing domestic crisis around Downing Street’s lockdown parties – Sturgeon urged him to “rebuild his government’s tattered reputation” by taking overdue action on Russian funding in the Conservative party and “Londongrad”-style influence operations in the UK.  Writing for the Guardian, Scotland’s first minister said: “We cannot be blind to the circumstances which have led to the current crisis, and that includes the situation where wealth with direct links to the Putin regime has been allowed to proliferate here in the UK with often the scantest of regard paid to its provenance or to the influence it seeks to bring to bear on our society. “[Johnson] must recognise that both his government and his party have enabled this situation, and he must acknowledge that the most resolute action he can take is at home, to rebuild his government’s tattered reputation.” Describing the current political and military threat to Ukraine as “unspeakable”, Sturgeon said: “Like any European country, Ukraine must be free to organise its governance and security alliances as it sees fit.” She added: “As someone who has spent my life campaigning for the sovereign right of the people of Scotland to determine our own futures, this is a principle fundamental to my own worldview. To see such pressures being exerted on a state which has resolutely set itself on a path to integration with the liberal democratic order is unspeakable.” Sturgeon went on to repeat her call for Westminster to legislate on the improper use of Scottish limited partnerships, a type of investment fund heavily criticised for facilitating the laundering of international criminal proceeds. “Corruption and lack of transparency is a drag on liberal democracy, and authoritarians have become adept at using these scandals as a way of saying to people ground down by them that somehow all forms of government are the same, and all politicians are as bad as each other.” On Monday, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, unveiled legislation to allow Britain to hit banks, energy companies and “oligarchs close to the Kremlin” with economic sanctions in the event of Russian invasion of Ukraine, but anti-corruption campaigners urged the UK government to act now.",News/Politics,Nicola Sturgeon urges Johnson to tackle Russian oligarchs’ influence in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/nicola-sturgeon-johnson-tackle-russian-oligarchs-influence-uk
2/2/2022,"The family behind Blackwell’s, the UK’s largest independent bookseller, has put the business up for sale after ditching a plan to hand it to employees. A deal would take Blackwell’s, which operates 18 shops and a website, out of family control for the first time in its 143-year history.  The retailer said it was looking for an external investor after a plan to put the business into employee ownership fell through. It said that goal “ultimately proved to be difficult, due in large part to the ongoing uncertainty on the high street caused by Covid-19”. Blackwell’s, which was founded in Oxford and operates Heffers in Cambridge as well as flagship stores in London and Edinburgh, said underlying sales for the year to December 2021 rose 1.9%, a figure that suggests falling store sales and rising online trade. Julian Blackwell, the group’s owner and president, said: “I would have loved to have handed over the company to its staff, but I also accept that in order to grow and remain competitive in the future, it is time for new ownership, ideas and investment. “I have always stood for innovation and transformation in the constantly changing world of bookselling. I am delighted to have supported, and now see, Blackwell’s become a significant player in online bookselling.” Potential buyers are likely to include Waterstones, which is owned by the aggressive New York hedge fund Elliott Advisors. It snapped up rival independent Foyles in 2018 and previously took over smaller booksellers Dillons, Hatchards and Ottakar’s. While such a deal might attract attention from the competition watchdog, the scale of competition from Amazon and WH Smith means it could gain approval. David Prescott, the chief executive of Blackwell’s, said: “The sale of Blackwell’s represents a genuinely unique and exciting opportunity for any potential buyer to own a much loved and trusted bookselling brand. The business has been quietly and successfully transitioning itself in recent years to establish a substantial global online presence alongside a core portfolio of iconic shops. We hope that a new owner and investment will help us to secure a long-term future for Blackwell’s and its booksellers for many years to come.” The potential sale was first reported by Sky News.",News/Business,Family owners put Blackwell’s bookshops up for sale,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/family-blackwells-bookshops-for-sale-sign-waterstones
2/2/2022,"The governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, has pushed back against calls to condemn a series of neo-Nazi protests that took place over the weekend, saying people are attempting to “smear” him. On Saturday and Sunday, a group of 15 to 20 protesters donned Nazi symbols and chanted antisemitic slurs along the North Alafaya Trail in Orlando. According to videos that quickly circulated across social media, the protesters gave Nazi salutes, yelled “White power!”, waved an anti-Biden banner and at one point got into a brawl with a driver.  The protests have been met with disgust from Democrats and Republicans alike. However, DeSantis did not publicly condemn the marchers until Monday during a press conference, and then largely to deflect blame on to his political opponents. “So what I’m going to say is these people, these Democrats who are trying to use this as some type of political issue to try to smear me as if I had something to do with that, we’re not playing their game,” he said. DeSantis also accused the Democrats of fostering antisemitism on Capitol Hill: “I’m not going to have people try to smear me that belong to a party that elevated antisemites to the halls of Congress.” He called the protesters “some jackasses doing this on the street” and suggested the matter was a police issue. “First of all, state law enforcement is going to hold them accountable because they were doing stuff on the overpass, so they are absolutely going to be doing that and they should do that.” DeSantis’s comments came a day after his press secretary, Christina Pushaw, drew widespread criticism over a tweet that she posted, then deleted, on Sunday. She wrote: “Do we even know they’re Nazis? Or is this a stunt like the ‘white nationalists’ who crashed the Youngkin rally in Charlottesville and turned out to be Dem staffers? I trust Florida law enforcement to investigate and am awaiting their conclusions.” The “stunt” Pushaw referred to was an incident last October in which the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump Republican political action committee, sent a group of people pretending to be white supremacists to an event for the Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin in Charlottesville, Virginia. In response to Pushaw’s comments, the Anti Defamation League wrote that it was “alarmed that @ChristinaPushaw would first give cover to antisemites rather than immediately and forcefully condemning their revolting, hate-filled rally and assault”. The Orange county sheriff, John Mina, announced that his office is launching an investigation into the protests, saying: “This hatred has no place in our society. Any reports of criminal activities will be thoroughly investigated.”",News/US news,Ron DeSantis pushes back against calls to condemn neo-Nazi protests,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/01/ron-desantis-neo-nazi-protests
2/2/2022,"When hundreds of thousands of workers across the country walked out of their jobs in protest at the military’s seizure of power in Myanmar on 1 February 2021, Grace* was among the first to join. Although she was seven months pregnant, the middle-school teacher from Chin state was determined to resist the military by refusing to work under its administration. Joining her was her husband, also a government employee.  What they didn’t then know was that nearly a year later, their hands, once accustomed to holding chalk and pens, would instead be holding hoes and shovels, calloused and blistered from farming under the scorching sun. Nor did they ever imagine that they would be living in hiding, on the run from soldiers and police. “My husband and I decided to strike soon after the coup was staged. For fear of being arrested by the police, we haven’t been able to return home for nine months,” says Grace, talking to the Guardian from an undisclosed location. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. “Two of my family members were arrested because of me. Our houses were raided. We have no regular source of income and have to struggle every day to make a living. But never have I ever regretted joining the civil disobedience movement, not even once. We are part of the revolution against the military dictatorship.” In the year since the coup, Myanmar has been plunged into chaos and a spiralling economic crisis as the military responds to the widespread civilian defiance to its rule with deadly violence and mass arrests. Some of its main targets are the hundreds of thousands of public sector workers, including teachers, nurses and doctors participating in a campaign of civil disobedience and refusing the serve the regime. Public hospitals are barely functioning, and when state schools opened in June, more than half the teachers were absent. Private and public bank workers have also been striking en masse, and even withdrawing cash is now near-impossible. In an effort to crush the movement and make people return to their jobs, military forces have started hunting down striking public sector workers across the country and raiding their homes. Since the strikes began in February, at least 140 people have been arrested for their participation, of whom 107 remain in detention, the Guardian was told by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a Myanmar-focused rights monitoring group. The AAPP says at least eight of those taking part in the civil disobedience movement have died in military interrogation centres, and seven of the bodies showed signs of torture. Families have also been targeted. Since the coup, 46 people have been taken as hostages in an attempt to force their family members participating in civil disobedience to turn themselves in; 39 of these hostages are still in custody, according to the AAPP. Grace went into labour shortly after she left her home. With family members being targeted by police raids, she was so scared of being arrested she registered at the hospital under a fake name. Her husband did not dare accompany her. The military has also attempted to force those who are taking part in the strikes to return to work by making it harder for them to survive. It has evicted thousands from worker housing, and stopped paying salaries. Last May, more than 125,000 striking teachers had their contracts suspended in an attempt to try and force them back into the classroom. The Guardian spoke with seven teachers in Chin state who are still on strike. They all said their only financial support was community donations, which were irregular and amounted to less than half of their former income. For Grace and her family this is not enough to survive. In June, the couple began farming corn. On weekends, they sell fried snacks to make ends meet. They still face the constant risk of arrest. As violence and military attacks escalate across the country, many teachers and other public sector workers who have gone on strike are now also living under the shadow of war. Since May, fighting has dramatically increased. The military has sought to quell armed resistance by attacking entire civilian populations, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that more than 400,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Intensifying military attacks caused Ling Kee*, a high school headteacher who joined the civil disobedience movement and went on strike last year, to leave the town of Thantlang in August with his three adult daughters, also strikers, and his wife. They took shelter with relatives in Hakha township, but a month later had to flee again upon hearing that soldiers were going door to door hunting down strikers. With nothing but the nightclothes they were wearing, they drove motorbikes through the night along mountain roads until they crossed the border into India. . Unable to work there, they are relying on their savings to survive. Students have also joined taken action against military-run services. After weeks of protests over a military “slave education system” in May, only 10% of the country’s nearly 10 million people of school age registered this year, according to the Myanmar Teachers’ Federation. When state schools opened across the country in June, many of them guarded by armed soldiers, classrooms were empty. To ensure that youth do not miss out on their education, churches, civil society organisations and striking teachers have established multiple grassroots education channels, supported by community donations. But funds are limited, and teachers also worry that their classes could get caught in the crossfire of the ongoing fighting, a teacher from Kanpetlet township told the Guardian. Biak* had just one year of high school left when the coup happened. Now living in a refugee camp in Mizoram, India, after her home was destroyed in a military attack, she is unable to study because there are no education facilities. “Currently, my family doesn’t have a house to live in, and I have no chance to study. All of my dreams were reduced to ashes, just like the homes in Thantlang, including mine,” she says. * Pseudonyms have been used for security reasons Sui Meng Par is an independent researcher from Chin State, Myanmar and writes about current issues in Chin State.

2/2/2022,"The captain of Raith Rovers women’s team has resigned and the club’s shirt sponsor has withdrawn her support in protest at the signing of David Goodwillie, who was found to have raped a woman by a civil court in 2017. Fans and employees of Raith Rovers and sexual violence campaigners have reacted angrily after the Fife club confirmed on Monday night it was signing the striker from Clyde following weeks of speculation and growing concern from supporters.  The women’s captain, Tyler Rattray, announced on Tuesday: “After 10 long years playing for Raith, it’s gutting I have given up now because they have signed someone like this and I want nothing to do with it!” Val McDermid, the best-selling crime author, who is a devoted fan of the club and their shirt sponsor, denounced the signing as “disgusting and despicable”. The Raith Rovers manager, John McGlynn, said Goodwillie had “a proven track record as a goalscorer” and that signing him was “crucial to the club’s promotion push in our quest to reach the SPFL Premiership – it is a great signing for Raith Rovers as a club, as David is the top goalscorer in Scotland”. Goodwillie, along with another footballer David Robertson, was sued for damages for rape by Denise Clair, who waived her right to anonymity, in a landmark case in 2017. The pair had not been prosecuted, but the civil court ruled they had raped Clair after meeting her on a night out in West Lothian in 2011, and she was awarded £100,000 in damages. They denied the allegation and appealed against the judgment but lost. McDermid, a prominent feminist who grew up supporting the club, added that the thought of Goodwillie wearing a Raith Rovers shirt made her feel “physically sick”. “I have this morning ended my lifelong support of Raith Rovers over their signing of the rapist David Goodwillie. I have cancelled next season’s shirt sponsorship over this disgusting and despicable move. This shatters any claim to be a community or family club. Goodwillie has never expressed a shred of remorse for the rape he committed. His presence at Starks Park is a stain on the club. I’ll be tearing up my season ticket too. This is a heartbreaker for me and many other fans, I know.” Marie Penman told the Guardian that she has handed in her resignation from her “dream job” as employability officer for the club’s community foundation after learning of Goodwillie’s signing. “I’ve supported Raith Rovers since I was a teenager, and followed them all over Scotland, but I’m disappointed and dismayed, especially with so much prominence given to violence against women right now. What message is this sending to the hundreds of girls who come through the doors of the community club? They will never get that support back.” Other supporters expressed similar sentiments, with a number raising concerns about the message the decision sends to the women’s team – the oldest affiliated women’s team in Scotland – which also runs teams for under-16s and girls. Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, called on the club to change its mind. “We are surprised and deeply disappointed that Raith Rovers FC are happy to send such a clear message of disregard to survivors of rape and sexual violence in signing David Goodwillie. “Fundamentally – though it seems Raith FC do not agree – women’s lives are more important than men’s talent or careers. Footballers are role models – particularly for young people – and it’s not OK to have someone in this position who has been found by a senior judge to be a rapist. We wonder whether those who took this decision thought for a second about how it may look or feel to survivors to have to watch someone judged to have committed rape be celebrated and applauded.” Goodwillie, now 32, was fined £250 for punching a man in a Stirling nightclub in 2008, and four years later pleaded guilty to assaulting a man in Glasgow city centre.",Sport/Football,Raith Rovers women’s captain resigns amid fury over David Goodwillie signing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/raith-rovers-womens-captain-resigns-amid-fury-over-david-goodwillie-signing
2/2/2022,"One of the star attractions in the collection of the Courtauld Gallery in London is Vincent van Gogh’s Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear, which was painted in January 1889. The artist had mutilated his left ear two days before Christmas, following a quarrel with Paul Gauguin, with whom he had been sharing a house in Arles. Van Gogh looks pale and introspective, clean-shaven, dressed for the winter chill in his yellow room, an easel behind him and a Japanese print on the wall (the Courtauld owns this print, too, but it was stolen in the 1980s and never recovered). The Dutch artist has the hunted look of a man not yet ready to re-enter the world, except through his painting. The open blue door on the right is the same blue door that appears in the picture of his straw-bottomed yellow chair, which now hangs in the same room at the Courtauld. You can take the chair as a kind of self-portrait, too. It is as if he has stepped out for a second, leaving his pipe and tobacco pouch on the seat. Van Gogh: Self-Portraits, the new exhibition at the recently reopened Courtauld gallery in London, is filled with presences, absences, substitutions, and echoes of different kinds. It is a magical and at times mysterious show. An exhibition of electrifying intimacy, it shows the artist at his most self-aware and at his most vulnerable. Every painting is both a kind of analysis and a rescue attempt. During the three and a half years before his death in 1890, Van Gogh painted around 35 self-portraits: some may have disappeared or been painted over. Fifteen are here (not counting that chair), as well as a sheet of three graphite, pen and ink drawings. Some are too fragile to travel, others from private collections could not be borrowed. The curators also wished to avoid unnecessary repetition. Some others were considered too clunky or otherwise unsuccessful. As it is, all the above are illustrated in the catalogue.  Van Gogh was described variously by people who knew him as “well built” and “a rather weedy little man, with pinched features”. His appearance in these portraits – bearded or not, hair clipped short, shaved, unkempt, ill, better fed, on the mend, confident, nervous, withdrawn, sunken-cheeked (he had 10 teeth removed in Antwerp, making him look older than a man in his 30s) or wearing his vulcanised rubber dentures – provides an index of his physical well-being, self-image and psychological state. The multiple ways he paints himself are also complicated by his artistic intentions and development, not to mention his material circumstances. The paints and canvases he could afford, as well as his diet, whether he was on or off the drink, his thoughts about colour and touch, the ways he wanted to present himself to others and the state of his mind, all leave their trace. Most works were completed in a single session. He’d paint then move on. Head turned a little to the left, turned slightly to the right, then full frontal – many of his self-portraits, especially the 22 he completed in Paris, might be seen as studies, experiments in artistic and personal style, all played out on a small scale, all derived from looking at his reflection in a small mirror. No chance to step back for a bigger view, or to see himself in profile, which would have needed a second mirror. The earliest here, painted in the winter of 1886-87, has him done up in a heavy coat and dark felt hat: red beard, blue and white cravat, looming out of the gloom, one side of his face in shadow. A couple of months later and he’s already turned up the colour, loosened up the brushwork and let the white of the canvas show through. Then the brushwork gets more rhythmic and he’s playing with the patterning and contours of his jacket, the interplay between drawing with the brush and tonal modelling. In one, his head is surrounded by a swarm of little blue flecks and dabs. He used these notes of colour to affect a transition between the shorthand modelling of his jacket and the dark purplish background, which has since entirely disappeared – the cheap crimson pigment he used contained cochineal, and has faded to nothing. Colour and tonality have gone out of whack in other works too, over time. His beard is well-trimmed and then it isn’t. His eyes go in and out of alignment and he paints himself head-on in a wonky grey felt hat (a bit more sporty and louche than the black number he had on in winter). He’s both serious and natty, but something has gone seriously awry with one side of his face in this one: an eye and a cheekbone warp out at you in a disconcerting way. Once you see it, you can’t stop staring. He must have had to keep turning his head in the mirror to see himself and lost track of the relationship between self and canvas. Next he’s in a painter’s blouse and looking at us over his shoulder. Then he’s in a peasant’s straw hat. The brushwork is speeding up and then hits a gallop, pitter-pattering all over the place. By September, he seems to have reined it in, before beginning to cover everything – jacket, face, hat, background – with bristling arrays of parallel marks, a sort of rhythmic painted tattoo. He looks as prickly as a hedgehog or a werewolf. The painting ran away with him, as if it were mapping unseen energies flowing through everything, and he is trying to weave a self-portrait out of it all. All the while, Van Gogh is trying to do something other than capture brute likeness or appearance, something more like vivid living presence. “I would like to do portraits which would look like apparitions to people a century later,” he wrote. He first turned to portraiture as a possible means of earning a living, and to counter the boom in portrait photography, which he saw as mechanical. But these paintings weren’t made with any eye for the market. Painting himself gave Van Gogh much more trouble than portraits of other people. He’s checking in on himself, in more ways than one. At the beginning of 1888, Van Gogh completed a larger painting in which we see the artist before his canvas, holding his palette and a fistful of brushes. The lumps of pigment on the palette feed into the cross-hatchings he uses to describe the weave of his jacket, the wooden support of the canvas in front of him, his head and his hair. They even fill the background, though the colour is almost flat. Light catches on the textured vertical and horizontal strokes. He may only be pushing the paint about, but this is very beautiful. By the time he leaves for the south, Van Gogh has assimilated all the experimentation of the previous year and this painting has a peculiar dignity and sense of solitary concentration, almost a kind of monumentality. He isn’t looking at us. He isn’t discernibly looking at anything. Next we leap a year to the artist with his mutilated ear and then two final portraits, which have not hung together since he painted them in the asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. The first is overworked, the impasto strokes delineating his face scraped down and giving his appearance a haggard, ruined look. The shadows are muddy and flat. The doctors had only reluctantly let him paint at this time, fearing he’d eat the paint and try to poison himself. He’d done this before. The second self-portrait, painted a week or so later, sees him holding his palette, his beard and hair trimmed, his expression alert, the brushwork lively, confident and assured, the colour singing and luminous. It might almost be a different man.
