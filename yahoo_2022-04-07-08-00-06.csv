4/7/2022,"PRATTVILLE — It started with dominoes games between friends that ended with three men dead; shot and bludgeoned to death. Prattville's deadliest crime ended Wednesday, five years later, with two men sentenced to prison for the rest of their natural lives without the possibility of parole. But is it over, can it ever be over, for the families of Tony D. Smith, Eddie Dean Scott and Al Seal Benson? About 50 family members of the victims of the July 3, 2017 massacre in Smith's barber shop gathered in a Prattville courtroom Wednesday afternoon. They witnessed Circuit Judge Bill Lewis Jr. sentence Marty Morgan, 38, and Keon Cain, 23, both of Prattville, to life in prison without the possibility of parole on capital murder charges. Both men pleaded guilty, Morgan in 2019 and Cain about a week ago before his trial was set to begin, after the death penalty was taken off the table. The victims' families approved the plea agreements. 'Barbershop massacre': Prattvlle's deadliest crime wraps with guilty plea About a dozen family members addressed the court before the sentences were meted out. Cain and Morgan stood to the side, under Lewis' orders, to listen to the comments. The process took almost two hours. The most asked question was why? Why did this happen? Everyone in this case knew one another — the victims, their families, Morgan and Cain. Smith, Scott and Benson were well-known and well-respected men in the community. They were youth sports coaches, they coached Cain when he was younger. They drove him to games and practices and made sure he had cleats and equipment. Cain was a neighbor of Eddie Scott, growing up across the street from him, Scott's son, Jason, told the court. Another of Smith's relatives recalled changing Cain's diapers. Morgan too grew up in the same tight-knit group, going to school and playing sports with the relatives of the victims. They had spent time together on porches, helped care for sick relatives and comforted each other during funerals. ""What you did was stupid and senseless, it will never make sense,"" Mallory Anderson, Smith's niece told Morgan and Cain. ""For a while I carried hatred in my heart for you. ""Not anymore. You don't deserve my anger."" Anderson gave an emotional statement to the court, voice strong, often looking over to Morgan and Cain. ""This is last thing I will say, the last thing I will ever say to you,"" she said. ""I pray you can make peace with yourself and your creator."" Many of the victims' relatives that addressed the court offered their forgiveness of Morgan and Cain. Others actually thanked Cain and Morgan for taking the pleas and sparing the families from going through two trials. ""At the end of the day, I knew I had to forgive you,"" Jason Scott said. The experience of losing his father led Jason to become a minister. ""Yeah, they made mistakes and shook the city up. Thank you for stepping up and taking responsibility for what you did. ""God can change your hearts."" Other family members expressed anger. ""I had a good brother, he would help anyone,"" Barbara Jean Benson said. ""He would give you the shirt off his back, Marty you know this. I never will forgive them. I hate them."" More: With guilty pleas in, what happens next in the Prattville barbershop killings case? Lewis gave Morgan and Cain the opportunity to speak during the proceeding. ""This is for the families, and my family too, I'm sorry,"" Morgan said. ""It wasn't supposed to happen, but it happened. I'm sorry."" Cain said he understood some of the victims' relatives would not believe him. ""I know my actions were wrong and I know I hurt a lot of y'all,"" he said. ""I regret what I did, I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry we had to go through this. ""I accept my punishment and take responsibility for what I did."" Before handing down the sentences, Lewis asked the families in the courtroom to stand. He told Cain and Morgan to turn and face them. ""They chose to do what you wouldn't do on July 3, they spared your lives,"" he said. ""Without them I don't think any plea agreements would have been reached."" Lewis then paused for several seconds, looking at the packed gallery. ""I hear you,"" he said. ""I heard forgiveness. I heard we don't want revenge, we want justice. I heard several of you ask why. We may never know why. And if in the coming years we do find out why, it won't make sense anyway. ""I know we can't bring your loved ones back. But from here on I hope you can begin to heal.""

4/7/2022,"Electronic Gaming Development Company (EGDC), a subsidiary of a foundation run by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, now owns 96.18% of Japanese developer SNK following a massive investment. According to an announcement sent to SNK investors in February, EGDC recently acquired a majority of SNK’s shares on the South Korea stock exchange, where the King of Fighters and Samurai Shodown studio has been publicly traded since 2019.

The nitty gritty of SNK’s report notes that EGDC purchased 14,048,218 shares at ₩37,197 KRW (around $30 USD) per share for a total price tag of over ₩522 billion KRW (around $430 million USD). This more than triples EGDC’s previous investment, which saw the company secure a 28.8% stake in SNK from Hong Kong-based shareholder Zuikaku Co., Limited in late 2020. Saudi Arabia spent the last year throwing money around the video game industry, with strategic investments in companies like Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, Capcom, and Nexon. Like many of Mohammed bin Salman’s dealings, these purchases fall within the Saudi Vision 2030 strategy established during his mid-decade rise to power, which on paper is meant to diversify the kingdom’s oil-centric economy. In reality, however, Saudi Vision 2030 is largely a propaganda campaign focused on whitewashing Saudi Arabia’s atrocious human rights record. The regressive monarchy seemingly hopes that aligning itself with entertainment industries around the world might loosen the purse strings of businesses wary of investing in the oil-rich country’s economy, especially with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the ongoing, U.S.-backed Yemeni genocide still looming overhead. But not everyone in the games industry has taken the money and run. When the League of Legends European Championship brokered a sponsorship promoting NEOM, the idiotic techno-city envisioned by Mohammed bin Salman as a $500 billion oasis in the Saudi desert, public backlash forced tournament organizer Riot Games to apologize to its fans and back out of the deal. “In an effort to expand our esports ecosystem, we moved too quickly to cement this partnership and caused rifts in the very community we seek to grow,” Riot said at the time. “While we missed our own expectations in this instance, we’re committed to reexamining our internal structures to ensure this doesn’t happen again.” I’m no expert in geopolitical maneuvering. I don’t know what lies ahead for SNK now that it’s owned by one of the closest people the modern world has to a supervillain. It could be that bin Salman is looking to soften his regime’s image via in-game propaganda, or perhaps he’s hoping the investment itself is enough to make it look like his is a government in renaissance rather than one known for oppressing women, executing homosexuals, and promoting religious zealotry. Either way, buying SNK games just got a whole lot harder to justify. While it sure felt bad when SNK was purchased by a pachinko manufacturer back in the day, seeing it get scooped up by Saudi Arabian war criminals is a whole new level of disappointment. King of Fighters XV is good, but not good enough to ignore this.

4/7/2022,"One of the Army's top logistics officers was fired and demoted after an inspector general investigation found he conducted ""counterproductive leadership behaviors,"" the service announced. Maj. Gen. Duane Gamble, formerly a three-star general, was investigated over allegations of racist behavior during his time as deputy chief of staff for logistics, a position commonly referred to as the G-4. That investigation found that Gamble did not discriminate on the basis of race, but he still received a general officer memorandum of reprimand, or GOMOR, over leadership issues, according to Cynthia Smith, an Army spokesperson. GOMORs are largely seen as automatic career killers for officers and are rarely handed out to top leadership. It's unclear whether Gamble will be able to retire at his previous three-star rank, which he earned in September 2019. Read Next: With Hour-Long Drives and Weeks Until Appointments, Pregnant Military Women Feel Pain of Medical Reforms Smith noted that Gamble's subordinates were ""satisfied with his leadership,"" despite it being ""counterproductive."" The investigation found that ""Gamble did not discriminate based on race, and that most of his actions had a positive impact on the organization,"" Smith said in a statement Wednesday. ""Additionally, command climate surveys identified a majority of Lt. Gen. Gamble's subordinates were satisfied with his leadership. The investigation did, however, substantiate that he displayed counterproductive leadership behaviors at times, for which he received a general officer memorandum of reprimand."" Smith declined to detail what led to Gamble losing his position and a star. Because positions for generals directly correlate with a specific rank, Gamble's reassignment as special assistant to the director of the Army staff reverts him back to a two-star general. Gamble was reported to the Army's inspector general in September 2020 over allegations he made racist remarks about Black subordinates, along with other inappropriate comments, according to an article published by Task & Purpose, which was first to report on the investigation. Maj. Gen. Charles Hamilton was promoted to lieutenant general Wednesday and assumed the duties of the G-4. He previously served as the G-4's director of operations. -- Steve Beynon can be reached at Steve.Beynon@military.com. Follow him on Twitter @StevenBeynon.

4/7/2022,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed legislation to provide the U.S. Postal Service with about $50 billion in financial relief over a decade, paving the way for future reforms as the service aims to overturn years in the red. Struggling with diminishing mail volumes despite having to deliver to a growing number of addresses, USPS has reported net losses of more than $90 billion since 2007. In February, it booked a quarterly net loss of $1.5 billion. ""The Postal Service is central to our economy and central to rural America,"" Biden said at a White House ceremony. The new bill enacts some measures proposed by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in a March 2021 reform plan that aims to eliminate $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade. In particular, it eliminates a requirement that USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for current and retired employees for 75 years, a condition faced by no other business or federal entity, saving $27 billion over a decade. Future postal retirees must now enroll in government health insurance, a move that will save it $22.6 billion over 10 years. On the day of the signing, USPS filed notice with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) to raise prices of first-class mail stamps from 58 cents to 60 cents and raise First-Class Mail prices approximately 6.5%. Asked in an interview why USPS was seeking the price hike, DeJoy was blunt: ""Because we need money."" Even after the legislative changes and PRC pricing changes approved in 2021, USPS still needs to cut more red ink, he said, speaking after the White House event. ""I've still got about $80, $90 billion to do and we have a lot of plans to keep moving that forward,"" DeJoy said. ""Now it's really about improving our service, reducing our cost from waste, investing in our facilities and employees and growing our business."" Biden last month also proposed $5 billion for USPS to handle election mail over the next decade. His predecessor Donald Trump criticized voting by mail that was used by a record 46% of 2020 voters. ""The Postal Service delivers democracy,"" Biden said on Wednesday. Still, the postal service has faced criticism from the White House and Democrats in Congress over a decision to buy mostly fossil fuel powered vehicles for its next-generation delivery fleet from Oshkosh Defense. USPS ""needs to do more to modernize and electrify its fleet of vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to save money,"" Biden said.

4/7/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan plans to ease COVID 19-related border restrictions by lifting its entry ban for foreign nationals from 106 countries including the United States, Britain and France on Friday, the government said. Tokyo has been gradually relaxing pandemic-induced curbs but the loosened border regime does not mean a full reopening to tourists. The foreign ministry said in an update on Wednesday that foreigners from the 106 countries would not be subject to denial of permission to enter Japan from Friday, but foreigners with tourist purposes were still not allowed into the country. Japan closed its borders to most foreign travellers from the early days of the pandemic in 2020 and only recently accepted a trickle of students and business people into the country. Many other developed countries have reopened to tourists. After the planned lifting, Japan will still keep its doors closed to 56 countries, another government statement said. The government has said it will raise the daily quota on overseas visitors to Japan to 10,000 this month, from 7,000.
