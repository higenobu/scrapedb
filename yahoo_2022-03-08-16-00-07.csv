3/8/2022,"South Korean YouTuber Ken Rhee says he is in Ukraine to fight, despite Korea's travel ban there. Koreans who enter Ukraine without authorization may be subject to a jail sentence or a fine. ""If I return alive, then I will take responsibility for everything,"" Rhee said on Instagram. Popular South Korean YouTuber and former Korean Navy Seal Ken Rhee said he has landed in Ukraine to fight as a volunteer soldier — despite his government's travel ban to the country. On Instagram, the 37-year-old said in a post early Monday morning that he and his travel mates had initially considered departing for the country ""through official procedures."" ""But we felt strong opposition from the Korean government, and there was some friction,"" noting that he was ""threatened"" with ""being treated as a criminal"" if he ignored Korea's travel ban to Ukraine. ""But punishment cannot stand still in this situation without helping Ukraine with the skills, knowledge, and expertise we have,"" he continued in the post, which was shared alongside a picture of the backs of three men. ""If I return alive, then I will take responsibility for everything and receive the punishment I'm given."" It is unclear who Rhee has left the country with. He did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that it was aware that ""Koreans including Ken Rhee"" have departed the country to join the Ukrainian volunteer army. ""To protect the lives and safety of citizens, as of Feb. 13, the government has issued a Level 4 travel warning throughout Ukraine and has banned Korean citizens from traveling to Ukraine,"" it said. It added that anyone who enters Ukraine without authorization may be subject to a year in prison or a fine of up to 10 million won ($8,150). They would also be required to return their Korean passports and could face challenges applying for a replacement, it said. But Rhee did not seem too concerned by the prospect. In another Instagram post addressed to the Foreign Ministry, he wrote: ""My team has arrived safely in Ukraine. Rather than waste time seeking to invalidate our passports, think about how you can support."" Later, Rhee shared several more posts on the platform, including a picture of a military tent, and one of himself in army gear sitting next to a dog. ""During the Korean War, the world helped Korea,"" he said. ""Now, we will help Ukraine. We cannot just stand by and watch innocent people get hurt and die."" To date, Rhee's YouTube channel has amassed more than 774,000 subscribers, and his videos have gained more than 100 million views. Rhee shot to fame in 2020 after appearing in the YouTube series ""Fake Men,"" where he trained celebrity contestants to complete a brutal regimen designed for the navy's elite forces, per the Korea Herald. As a former Navy Seal himself, he has also shared his expertise as a guest on variety shows in South Korea, the outlet said. In 2020, he was embroiled in controversy when it came to light that he was convicted of sexual assault in 2019. Rhee claims he was wrongfully convicted, per the Korea Herald.

3/8/2022,"Russian aircraft on Thursday destroyed the Ukranian patrol boat Sloviansk, a former U.S. Coast Guard Island Class patrol boat that was transferred to the country’s navy in 2019. Volodymyr Novatsky, mayor of the port city of Yuzhny, announced March 6 in a video posted to YouTube that the vessel had sunk and an unknown number of crew members were missing, including a resident of his town. ""On March 3, an airstrike was carried out by an enemy aircraft on the Sloviansk patrol boat, as a result of which it sank. People also went missing,"" Novatsky said.

The two were joined last November by the former Island Class patrol boats Ocracoke and Washington, renamed as the Sumy and Fastiv. The vessels were donated to Ukraine under the Coast Guard’s Office of International Acquisition Excess Defense Articles Program. As part of the agreement, the vessels’ crews were trained in the U.S. at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore by members of the Coast Guard Cutter Transition Division Training Team. The ships were to be augmented by the former Island Class patrol boat Kiska, scheduled for delivery to Ukraine in January 2022. The Ukrainian crew of the former Kiska – now called the Kubrak – completed their training in Baltimore on Oct. 22, but it’s unclear if the patrol boat has left the Coast Guard Yard. The Coast Guard declined to comment on the loss of the former Cushing. And Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Brittany Panetta said it would not be appropriate for active-duty service members who served on the ship to discuss the sinking. The Coast Guard's 49 Island Class vessels were built between 1985 and 1992 to conduct offshore surveillance, law enforcement and search and rescue operations, among other duties. They are armed with a single Mk 38 Mod 0 Bushmaster machine gun system and two Browning M2HB heavy machine guns. Fifteen remain in U.S. service. Four are serving in the country of Georgia’s Coast Guard while several others are serving in Costa Rica and Pakistan. The class is being replaced with 64 Sentinel class fast response cutters, 45 of which are now operational. Ten days after Russia attacked Ukraine, the situation in the Black Sea continues to degrade. According to reports and social media, Ukraine scuttled its flagship frigate Hetman Sahaidachny on March 3 in Mykolaiv, while there were reports March 7 of a ship fire off Odessa, with pictures of billowing smoke from the Russian corvette Vasily Bykov, one of the vessels that took part in the assault on the Ukrainian outpost of Snake Island on Feb. 24. – Reporter Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report.

3/8/2022,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Back in August, New Zealand's government put the entire nation on lockdown after a single community case of the coronavirus was detected. On Tuesday, when new daily cases hit a record of nearly 24,000, officials told hospital workers they could help out on understaffed COVID-19 wards even if they were mildly sick themselves. It was the latest sign of just how radically New Zealand's approach to the virus has shifted, moving from elimination to suppression and now to something approaching acceptance as the omicron variant has taken hold. Experts say New Zealand's sometimes counterintuitive actions have likely saved thousands of lives by allowing the nation to mostly avoid earlier, more deadly variants and buying time to get people vaccinated. The nation of 5 million has reported just 65 virus deaths since the pandemic began. But virus hospitalizations have been rapidly rising, hitting a record of more than 750 on Tuesday and putting strain on the system. Across the country, the explosion in cases has left people stunned. Just a month ago, case numbers were around 200 per day. Now, the outbreak is affecting everyone from frontline workers to lawmakers. Opposition Leader Christopher Luxon became the highest profile politician yet to announce he was infected on Monday, saying he felt fine and would continue working from home. One factor that hastened the outbreak was the return of thousands of university students to campuses around the country last month. Ralph Zambrano, the student president at Victoria University of Wellington, said the virus had spread rapidly through hundreds of students in residence halls, taking a toll on their mental health and well-being. “The campus would usually be buzzing at this time of year but it has a very eerie feeling to it,” he said, adding that most students were opting to learn remotely. “There's lots of anxiety and tension.” He said the outbreak had strained the food supply system in the halls, with some students being offered only a protein drink for breakfast or a piece of cold meat and some peas for dinner. The university said case numbers in the halls were now reducing as students recovered. Professor Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago, said the variant had proved as ferociously infectious in New Zealand as it had in other countries. He said cases appeared to be plateauing or even starting to dip in the largest city of Auckland, while still rising elsewhere. While much of the world was breathing a sigh of relief  after two years of terrible problems, Baker said, New Zealand was at its worst point yet in the pandemic and was coming to terms with the fact the virus would remain in the country permanently. He said he was concerned health authorities had lost the ability to properly track the outbreak, as they struggled to shift from a system where they carefully monitored a few cases to dealing with thousands of self-reported results from rapid antigen tests. Dr. Caroline McElnay, the director of public health at the Ministry of Health, told reporters the number of hospitalizations would grow, but that patients with omicron generally had less severe illnesses than previous patients had experienced with the delta variant. She said the rising number of both patients and infected health workers had prompted the relaxation in the rules around when health workers could return to hospitals. She said infected workers would only be allowed to work with patients who already had the virus, and if there were no other options. “It's an extra tool that enables our health system to keep running,” she said.",Health/Associated Press,"As virus cases go from 1 to 24,000, New Zealand changes tack",https://news.yahoo.com/virus-cases-1-24-000-054150801.html
3/8/2022,"Ukrainian President Zelensky said Russian forces are expected to bomb Odesa, a key port city. Zelensky said that such an assault on the country's third-largest city ""will be a war crime."" More than 1.5 million residents have fled Ukraine, per the UN refugee agency commissioner. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video released on Sunday said that Russian forces are expected to bomb Odesa, the country's third-largest city and a key shipping port on the Black Sea, calling such an assault ""a war crime,"" according to The Washington Post. Zelensky, who has rallied Ukraine against the invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin, lamented that the coastal city has been a welcoming place for citizens from Russia but could soon face a military onslaught. ""Russians always traveled to Odesa, always felt only warmth in Odesa,"" Zelensky said. ""And now what? Bombs against Odesa? Artillery against Odesa? Rockets against Odesa? This will be a war crime."" Odesa, known for its beaches, now has sand from its shoreline being used for roadblocks. According to The Post, Russian warships have been present off the city's shore for several days. The warning for Odesa — with a population of over 1 million residents – comes as Russia has continued their advance into Ukraine despite setbacks in their incursion into the country, including the stiff-armed resistance from Ukrainian forces and Zelensky's refusal to leave his government. The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense in a Sunday intelligence report stated that Russia has responded to the ""scale and strength of Ukrainian resistance"" by ""targeting populated areas in multiple locations, including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol."" ""This is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,"" the report stated. ""Russia has previously used similar tactics in Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016, employing both air and ground-based munitions."" Many parts of the county that were flourishing less than two weeks ago now lack heating, water, and electricity, with more than 1.5 million residents have fled the country, according to UN refugee agency commissioner Filippo Grandi. Grandi on Sunday called the displacement ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.""

3/8/2022,"A Russian oligarch told the captain of his yacht to sail from France to Turkey ASAP, per the WSJ. Igor Sechin's yacht was docked in France when he was sanctioned after Russia invaded Ukraine. French authorities tied the yacht down so it couldn't leave, a customs officer told The Journal. Igor Sechin, a Russian billionaire and oligarch, told the captain of his now-seized superyacht to leave a French port and sail to Turkey as fast as possible after he was hit with sanctions, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. The US and the European Union put Sechin, who is said to be a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on their sanctions lists shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Sechin is also known as Russia's ""Darth Vader."" The report on Sechin's orders offers a glimpse into how the wealthiest Russians who were targeted by sanctions sought to move their yachts and private jets across the world after the invasion of Ukraine in order to protect their assets. Eric Salles, a lead officer on the seizure operation, said in an interview with The Journal that French customs officers found out last week that the yacht was preparing to leave the French town of La Ciotat despite having repair work scheduled. Customs officers also heard the yacht was owned by Sechin, CEO of Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft, Salles added. The customs officers went to the yacht and questioned the captain, Salles said in the interview. The captain told officers that he had orders to leave the French port and ""sail to Turkey as quickly as possible,"" Salles told The Journal. After hearing this information, French authorities tied the yacht to the quay with steel-rope slings so it couldn't leave, Salles told The Journal. Officers proceeded to check documents, further question the captain and crew, and surveil the vessel 24/7, Salles added. Sechin's yacht was officially seized by the authorities on Wednesday night, according to a press release tweeted by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire. The yacht's captain — still on board the vessel with other crew members — wasn't arrested, Salles told The Journal. Sechin is among several high-profile Russian business executives who have been sanctioned by the EU, US, UK, and others because of their ties to Putin. Gennady Timchenko, a Putin confidant, and Alexei Mordashov, reportedly the wealthiest man in Russia, had their superyachts seized by officials in Italy, The Associated Press reported on Friday.
