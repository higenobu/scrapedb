3/30/2022,"A star fund manager who invested £1.5bn of his clients’ money in the scandal-hit Greensill Capital failed to report a dinner at Buckingham Palace, a £15,000 private jet trip to Sardinia, or secret fees and share options offered to his company by the since-collapsed lender, an investigation by the UK City regulator has revealed. The details emerged in final notices given to Swiss asset manager GAM and its former top fund manager, Tim Haywood, who will pay fines of £9.1m and £230,000 respectively for their failures. Both qualified for a 30% discount by agreeing to resolve the cases at an early stage, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) revealed on Wednesday. GAM, which has significant operations in London, sacked Haywood in July 2018 with little explanation, causing shocked investors to withdraw their money from the absolute return bond funds he managed. His fund had invested in some of the debt issued by Greensill, although it returned all money to investors before Greensill collapsed in 2021. Greensill, which employed former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser, collapsed early last year after investors lost confidence, in part because of its deep exposures to Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG metals empire, including Liberty Steel and major aluminium and mining assets. Haywood first invested GAM money in assets created by Greensill in 2014, and by 2018 GAM’s investments had reached £1.5bn. The FCA found that Haywood had breached GAM’s gifts and entertainment policy, by failing to declare the personal benefits he was receiving from Greensill, including “attendance at a charity dinner at Buckingham Palace on the invitation of an employee at Greensill” and using “a Greensill employee’s aircraft for a personal trip” to Sardinia. Cameron has also come under scrutiny for his use of Greensill’s private jet for personal trips to Cornwall. The FCA said: “Although the FCA did not find evidence that Mr Haywood made investment decisions because of these gifts and entertainment, the fact that conflicts were not properly managed heightened the risk that he may have been incentivised to invest for personal interest.” Greensill offered GAM a “fee ramp” worth $1.25m (£950,000) per year for investing in its funds, and also offered an equity warrant giving GAM the option to buy Greensill shares if it paid $15m. GAM’s conflict of interest committee failed to meet for almost three years, and the company failed to properly consider conflict of interest issues, including around Greensill’s offer of share options to GAM, the FCA said. Mark Steward, the executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: “A robust framework, properly implemented and followed by all staff, is required to manage any conflicts of interest. GAM failed to do this. In an asset manager, this is vital in ensuring decisions are taken for the benefit of the investors. Mr Haywood’s disclosure failings are equally serious ones.” GAM said the FCA had taken into account “the enhancements to the conflicts of interest framework, which had been made since the shortcomings occurred between 2014 and 2018”. “These steps also included refreshing the senior management team and significantly strengthening governance, control frameworks, policies, and training. All the lessons learned from that period are fully embedded in the firm and its culture.” Haywood was approached for comment. He told the Financial Times that he had always acted “in the best interests of clients”. He said: “I am very sorry for the things that I got wrong, with my failings described in the FCA summary. I have taken on board key lessons, and will strive to be a better investment manager in the future.”",News/Business,Fund manager failed to declare benefits from Greensill to UK regulator,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/fund-manager-failed-to-declare-benefits-from-greensill-to-uk-regulator
3/30/2022,"The stepfather of five-year-old Logan Mwangi has told a jury that he and the boy’s mother both struck him the day before he died and described carrying his body to the riverbank where he was found – but insisted they did not kill the child. John Cole, who is on trial alongside Logan’s mother, Angharad Williamson, and a 14-year-old boy, told Cardiff crown court he was woken on the night of the death by his partner screaming that her son was dead. The defendant said he gave Logan CPR but then, rather than phoning for the emergency services, he and Williamson crammed the boy’s body into a bag and he took it to the riverbank. Cole, 40, Williamson, 30, and the teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, deny murdering Logan, whose body was found in the river near his home in the village of Sarn in south Wales on 31 July last year, having suffered more than 50 injuries. The prosecution alleges all three were involved in murdering Logan before concocting a coverup that included dumping his body in the river and phoning the police to falsely report him missing. At the start of the defence case, Cole said that on the night of his death Williamson had been sitting with Logan in his room trying to calm him down because the boy had been “kicking off”. The defendant said he woke up at 2am on 31 July to the sound of Williamson screaming that Logan was dead. He said he went into the room and she told him she had just heard Logan take his last breath. “I tried to do CPR,” he said. “There was no response. Angharad said: ‘Please stop. He’s dead’.” Cole said he did not know how Logan had died. “It just didn’t make sense at all.” He said he and Williamson put a Spider-Man top on Logan, who was bare-chested, and then placed his body in a Nike bag. Asked why they had not called for help, Cole replied: “Shock, panic … I wasn’t thinking completely clearly. We put the top on him, put him in the Nike bag and I took him out the property. I believe Angharad said: ‘Just get him out of here.’ “I just ended up walking. I ended up putting Logan down by the riverbank. I didn’t put him in the river.” He said he then heard a noise and turned and saw the 14-year-old boy there. The defendant said he returned to Williamson with the 14-year-old and she asked him to get rid of a dinosaur-patterned pyjama top of Logan’s. He claimed he and the teenager went to some bushes and he threw it away. He told the jury that he used to get Logan to do press-ups to “burn off energy” and admitted that he and Williamson lied to social services about how the boy came by a burn on his neck. Cole said Logan had been running around boisterously and Williamson placed a hot coffee spoon on his neck. They told the authorities Logan had burned himself accidentally. In the days before he died, Logan had been isolating because he had Covid, Cole said, which put pressure on the couple. “Me and Angharad were both struggling.” The defendant said on the day before Logan’s body was found he smacked him on the hand and clipped him round the back of the head. He claimed Williamson had caught him on the cheek as she tried to clip him. Cole insisted he had not caused the child’s death.

3/30/2022,"Ukrainian refugees in Poland are frustrated and confused by British asylum rules, which they say appear designed more to keep people out than offer shelter to those fleeing war. Refugees arriving at Warsaw central station told the Guardian that they were baffled by the UK government’s rules requiring them to find a sponsor in Britain before they could apply for a visa, which could take weeks to be processed. None said they knew anyone in the UK who could sponsor them. “I think it’s very complicated,” said Katerina Ilasova, who fled her home city of Poltava after the invasion started. “I’ve heard lots of positive things about Britain. But for me it is too complex. So people are signing up to go to other countries that are easier to get to.” Ivan Yakovlev, who left Dnipro before the war started to work in Georgia, wanted to get to Britain because of the language. “I speak English, my wife speaks English; it will be good for us, simpler to find a job there. But I don’t know what we should do; I don’t have any connections.” A small team of British people has set up a stall inside Warsaw station to explain the rules to refugees and advise them on how to apply. They have had a handful of successes matching Ukrainians with British sponsors, but their efforts have been dwarfed by those of a Spanish group at a neighbouring stall, who have helped more than 1,000 Ukrainians start their journey to Spain, arranging free transport and hosts at the other end. “The bottleneck is in the visa system and the matching of refugees with hosts,” said Ed Pinkney, a British Hong Kong-based researcher who has been volunteering at the station for two weeks. “I’m getting frustrated because it’s wasting time that could have been given to the immediate needs of Ukrainians,” he said. “The logical thing to do would be to get them to the UK and do any checks there.” Some hopefuls do get lucky. Alyona Vinohradova was fortunate to bump into Terri Shanks, a woman from Berkshire who was in Poland for business. Shanks has offered to host Vinohradova, her husband and their 11-year-old daughter, Kamila, once the family’s application has been processed and their visa approved. “I don’t know why we can’t bring them in on a tourist visa,” says Shanks. “The Spanish are scooping them up and worrying about the paperwork later. We don’t seem to be doing that. It’s ridiculous when there’s a home waiting.” “I think it’s very complex,” said Vinohradova. “I think the UK is ensuring that all the Ukrainians don’t come.” Even those like Vinohradova who have been lucky enough to have found a British sponsor will probably have to wait weeks while their visa is processed. The British government stands apart from its European neighbours, which are all offering Ukrainian refugees visa-free travel. “Since my childhood, I was dreaming of going to England,” said Anna Lazareva, from Sumy in eastern Ukraine, who says she managed to find a sponsor on a Facebook group. Now she is waiting in Warsaw. “It’s already been four days. Hopefully I won’t have to wait much longer.”",News/Global development,"UK visa rules are ‘to ensure Ukrainians don’t come to Britain’, say refugees",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/30/uk-visa-rules-are-to-ensure-ukrainians-dont-come-to-britain-say-refugees
3/30/2022,"Harry Wootliff is the film-maker who in 2018 gave us the wonderfully tender and well-observed grownup love story Only You with Josh O’Connor and Laia Costa. Now she is back with another complex relationship, a humidly intense tale of amour fou, submission and emotional self-harm, adapted from Deborah Kay Davies’s novel True Things About Me. This is a well-acted movie with accomplished set-piece scenes of eroticism and residual, unfulfilled yearning. But sometimes it feels like the ambient atmosphere and performances are going nowhere. The characterisation isn’t as complex or as searching as it was in Only You, and in its third act the plot signs off with a lame and implausible resolution. The scene is a benefits office in a seaside town, where Kate (Ruth Wilson) has the boring task of interviewing all the variously upset and abusive claimants. Her mate Alison (Hayley Squires) has stuck her neck out to get her this job, and is already slightly worried and exasperated by Kate’s persistent lateness and not-very-well-concealed sarky attitude. Kate’s life changes when a moody, insolent and very sexy young guy with dyed blond hair swaggers in for an appointment, insouciantly revealing that he has just done four months’ jail time for something or other; he is played with obvious relish by Tom Burke. He quietly asks if he can take Kate out for lunch; Wilson conveys Kate’s frisson of excitement as she agrees and sneaks out to meet him against office rules. Instead of lunch, they have rough sex just by his Mercedes in the multi-storey car park (how does he afford a Mercedes?), and later he persuades her to bunk off work to come with him for a swim and more delicious al-fresco lovemaking. Soon she is, in the words of the song, mad about the boy. But with a terrible inevitability, this man starts treating her casually, not calling her for ages and then demanding she drop everything at a moment’s notice; she tells him everything about her but knows nothing about him. Kate becomes clingingly and pathetically obsessed, stalking his address on Google Street View. Then he airily announces that this Mercedes of his is mysteriously out of action and demands to borrow her car for a “business venture” and disappears for ages without giving it back. Could this man simply be using her? Could this be part of a repeated pattern of predatory abuse? Maybe Kate doesn’t care, because this toxic and destructive relationship is more passionate and real than anything else in her life. The crunch comes when the gorgeously cruel lover has one of his swings towards affection and invites Kate to Spain where his sister is supposedly getting married – although he is not travelling with her, having merely promised to meet her at the airport when she arrives. And it is at this point that the audience is entitled to wonder when we are going to meet this sister, or at least when Kate is going to demand to be introduced to members of his family, and if and when the mystery of his background is going to be illuminated. Well, the Spanish section of the film does not convince, either in what is supposed to be happening or in how it allegedly brings about a change in Kate. Yet Wilson and Burke give formidably good performances: a woman who desperately wants to give and receive love, and a man who hasn’t the smallest idea what any of that means.  True Things is released on 1 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,True Things review – eroticism and unfulfilled yearning in a seaside town,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/30/true-things-review-ruth-wilson-tom-burke
3/30/2022,"YouTube is refusing to delete the account of a serial offender who regularly posts videos from his prison cell and uses his channel to abuse judges, complain about his sentence and give details of drug-taking inside the UK jails. Sam Walker, who is serving a sentence for possession of 3kg of cannabis and driving while disqualified, has been filming videos of himself inside various forms of custody since 2018. His latest videos include a question-and-answer session this month from a Hull prison with some of the 23,700 subscribers to his YouTube channel. In it, he claims many of his fellow prisoners are “spiced up like zombies” and that security staff are “spineless”. Another purports to be filmed by a friend as Walker is escorted by prison guard for a trial last week in Chester crown court when he was found not guilty of possessing counterfeit money. In one video, when his guard asks him to move, Walker replies: “Hold on a sec, I’m talking”, and then goes on to accuse judges of being paedophiles who give drug dealers longer sentences than rapists. This year the Ministry of Justice’s (MoJ) digital media investigations unit has twice urged YouTube to take down Walker’s channel but both times it refused. A Prison Service spokesperson pointed out it was illegal to film from a prison. He said: “We will continue to press YouTube to remove this content. Anyone found in possession of a phone will face extra time behind bars.” In a video posted in January, Walker, who is from Liverpool, claimed he had raised £1,700 in a month from his video channel, which he said he was donating to a humanitarian campaign to improve conditions in the slums of Sierra Leone. YouTube has suggested that Walker’s prison videos remain available to view because he has not broken its rules, but it has now prevented him making any money from the account. Asked why it had refused the MoJ’s request to take down the video, YouTube did not directly answer. It said: “YouTube creators have a responsibility both on and off the platform. If we see that a creator’s on- and/or off-platform behaviour harms our community, we may take action such as suspending the channel from the YouTube partner programme, which would disable their ability to earn money.” It refused to elaborate but confirmed Walker’s account had been “demonetised”. Walker, who is thought to be 38, boasts that he first went to prison aged 14. His criminal record includes firearms offences, assault, and possession of drugs with intent to supply. He has recorded videos from numerous prison and police cells including Woodhill high-security prison, as he urged a fellow prisoner to guard the door to “make sure no screws come”. Walker has used his channel to discuss the tedium of prison life; the quality of prison food; his routine of working out and writing; and the effect on his mental health of being moved from various jails. After being transferred from Hull prison, he is currently in Forest Bank prison in Salford. In private, the Prison Service conceded that Walker’s videos highlighedt a continuing problem of the widespread availability of contraband mobile phones in prisons. “We know Walker doesn’t have a phone at the moment but we don’t know he hasn’t recorded more videos,” an MoJ source said. They added: “We’ve put in two requests to YouTube to remove the videos on the grounds that from our perspective this is illegal content that has been recorded inside prison. But if you can’t demonstrate beyond doubt that it’s been uploaded from within the prison, then YouTube says they will not automatically remove the content.” The source who has discussed the issue with YouTube said: “They said uploading the videos to YouTube isn’t a criminal offence. It would make our lives a lot easier if it was illegal for that footage to be broadcast from anywhere.” The source added: “YouTube are a free speech international platform which is not governed by any jurisdiction.” Walker has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,YouTube refuses to remove account of prisoner who films videos in his cell,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/youtube-refuses-to-remove-account-of-prisoner-who-films-videos-in-his-cell
3/30/2022,"Northern Ireland has been something of a hotspot for TV drama and comedy over the last few years. Crime shows such as The Fall and The Secret have drawn huge audiences, Derry Girls has been a worldwide hit, and even Game of Thrones made use of the landscape. Cinema has also given us compelling stories about this tiny country, with Good Vibrations and ’71 shedding new light on the Troubles. With the arrival of Belfast, Kenneth Branagh’s Oscar-winning ode to his childhood home, is Northern Ireland finally finding its storytelling voice? Well, no. Northern Ireland has always had a voice, and we’ve never been short of storytellers. The challenge has been finding someone to listen. What follows should not be taken as a best-of list, but as a chronological overview of our contribution to the literary world. The Troubles loom large over many of these stories, of course, but recent years have seen a divergence of our literature and the conflict that has defined us for so long. Each book here says something about where we’ve been and where we’re going, and each one deserves your attention. 1. Odd Man Out by FL GreenThe basis for Carol Reed’s classic film noir of the same name, Odd Man Out (1945) follows an IRA man’s last hours after he is mortally wounded during a bungled robbery. It is a nightmarish tour of post-second world war Belfast as Johnny McQueen searches desperately for help in a city of betrayal. Everyone wants something from him, but no one is willing or able to give him what he really needs: a safe place to die. 2. Across the Barricades by Joan LingardLingard’s bestselling teen romance from 1972 seemed ubiquitous when I was growing up in Northern Ireland, largely because of its many years of inclusion on school syllabuses. Published in the early years of the Troubles, it remained for some time as one of the only novels for young people in Northern Ireland to reflect their own daily lives. 3. Cal by Bernard MacLavertyMacLaverty’s 1983 novel is one of the touchstones of Troubles fiction. The titular protagonist’s obsession with the widow of the police officer he helped murder plays out as a kind of twisted love story. Riven with guilt and trapped by circumstance, Cal is buffeted from all sides by forces he can’t control, meaning his eventual fate comes as a perverse salvation. 4. Divorcing Jack by Colin BatemanBateman’s 1995 debut is a darkly comic thriller that skewers the ridiculous confluence of politics, sectarianism, and gangsterism that sustained conflict for so many years. No one is safe from the author’s cynical eye, and he manages to capture the morbid humour that kept Northern Ireland going through its darkest times. 5. Dead I Well May Be by Adrian McKintyMcKinty may be better know these days for his award-winning Sean Duffy series, and his international bestseller The Chain, but his 2003 debut paved the way for the wave of Northern Irish noir that followed. While it’s largely set in New York, it qualifies for this list by dint of its lethal protagonist, Michael Forsythe, and his distinctly Northern Irish view of the world. 6. Country by Michael HughesA retelling of the Iliad set in the Irish borderlands in the dying days of the Troubles might sound like hard work, but Michael Hughes’ 2018 novel somehow manages to be relentlessly entertaining. It also pulls off the feat of being told entirely in local vernacular while remaining smoothly readable. Country is an outstanding achievement on many levels. 7. Milkman by Anna BurnsTo view the Troubles as only being about Northern Ireland’s constitutional status is reductive. Class strife played an enormous role in igniting sectarian violence here, but gender – specifically toxic masculinity – supplied a good amount of the kindling. Burns’ 2018 Booker prize winner cuts to the bone of the fragile male ego’s need for domination and its use of violence to achieve it. 8. The Fire Starters by Jan CarsonCarson, like many other Northern Irish writers, delves into the shadow of past on present, but also uniquely explores the border between fantasy and reality in her 2019 novel. Like Milkman a year before, The Fire Starters mercilessly pierces the thin skin of toxic masculinity and its compulsion to violence, its drive to solve problems with flame or blade. The novel is also notable for honestly portraying the loyalist experience, a community often ignored in fiction, or worse, caricatured as a knuckle-dragging monolith. 9. The Last Crossing by Brian McGillowayAlthough McGilloway has been a mainstay of the Northern Irish crime fiction scene for more than a decade, 2020’s The Last Crossing may be his masterpiece. While it does work as a slow-burn thriller, where it really shines is as a study of guilt, memory and friendship. As the three protagonists journey across the Irish Sea to the Scottish burial ground of a murder victim, past and present blur and overlap until all that remains is the truth. 10. Who Took Eden Mulligan? by Sharon DempseyThere has been much discussion in recent years about how to address the legacy of the Troubles. There will never be a South Africa-style truth and reconciliation commission because no one will ever tell the truth about what they did. The job therefore falls to writers like Sharon Dempsey whose 2021 novel, like The Last Crossing, layers timelines to build an honest picture of our past and present.

3/30/2022,"How to Survive a Pandemic, investigative journalist and director David France’s documentary on the multi-pronged road to developing, producing, and inequitably distributing several Covid-19 vaccines, begins on the day vaccines went from murky future to clear horizon. The film opens in December 2020, in the remarkably bespoke basement of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Dr Peter Marks. The room is decked in Mardi Gras beads and a teddy bear; Marks’s clunky work laptop is surrounded by cans of oats. On camera and on the phone with Gen Gustave Perna, the chief operating officer of the federal Covid-19 response for vaccine and therapeutics, Marks celebrates the FDA’s emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. “Sorry you had to deal with all that political crap,” says Perna. “Vaccines will be moving tomorrow.” The moment is an undeniable achievement of modern science despite significant political headwinds in the US and, as France’s film deftly argues, an opportunity to empower public health largely squandered by national self-interest. By 2022, there are now several documentaries tackling some slice of the pandemic: Alex Gibney’s Totally Under Control, on the Trump administration’s costly botching of the early pandemic response in the US; Nanfu Wang’s similarly damning In the Same Breath, on the US and China’s mishandling of the virus; Matthew Heineman’s grueling The First Wave, on the devastating initial pandemic in New York. France’s film has its fair share of devastation and tragic Covid iconography – ambulances, ventilators, footage of mass burials. But is trained in particular on the sprint, from the moment the virus was sequenced, to develop a public health bulwark of vaccines: when they would be available, who would make them, how they would be distributed, how much the political chaos of the Trump administration would corrode the scientific process. “This totally opaque, massive scientific undertaking was invisible to everybody,” France told the Guardian. “Given how much money was being thrown into it through taxpayers’ money, and given how essential their work was, and how much we needed them to succeed, we eventually started thinking we should turn our obsession into a documentation project to make sure that this got recorded for posterity.” France and a team of contributors, which eventually spread to five continents, started shooting in April 2020, just weeks into the pandemic in the US. The nearly two-hour film embeds first and foremost with Jon Cohen, a senior correspondent for Science magazine who has also published widely elsewhere and, like France, was an early chronicler of the Aids crisis. Both Cohen and France, whose 2012 film How To Survive a Plague offers what many consider to be the definitive account of activism in response to the HIV/Aids crisis, were familiar with numerous public health experts from their prior work. “I knew that they would understand my proposal to them, which is that given the historic nature of this – a scientific undertaking unlike any in our lifetime, the entire globe waiting for them and putting our hopes on their shoulders – [to] let me in, let me behind the curtain,” France said. “And luckily, they agreed.” This includes White House adviser Anthony Fauci, who appears in the film over a glass of beer with Cohen on a back patio, after work hours. The project required a “magisterial amount of producing” crew on five continents, sometimes shooting on multiple continents at the same time. “We had this motto: do no harm,” France explained. “We were really careful about our requests for people’s time.” For those they did request, including developers of the Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, “people really understood the need to document,” France said. The crew worked out exclusive arrangements “where we said, ‘Look, I know you’re getting hit by a bunch of proposals, we want to do the definitive story as faithful to the science as possible.’” Overshadowing the whole process were the expectations of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump White House effort to turbocharge development of a vaccine, and the specter of the 2020 presidential election. Or, as Cohen put it in May 2020, as the global death toll surged past 250,000 lives: “We’re just scared that science will be steamrolled” by the political agenda. That anxiety permeates the film, particularly by public health officials toggling between candor and contrition around the political atmosphere that threatened to derail or alter the process. “I told everybody that we weren’t doing the politics story; we were doing the science story, but that the politics would of course be in the background,” France explained of striking a balance between acknowledgment of the political reality – a childish White House hellbent on staying in office – and a dispassionate view of the science. The film captures the weight of that noise, “to know whether science would be able to hold to its own rails given these hurricane winds.” The team found that the answer was yes, which was “an important revelation because there’s so much skepticism about the speed with which these vaccines were developed and rolled out,” France explained. Still, as France said, “a vaccine is only good if it becomes a vaccination” – and the second half of the film is concerned with the gnarled, incomplete rollout on a national and global scale, and resistance borne from genuine, grounded skepticism or cynical identity politics. The coordinated anti-vax movement enters the frame more as oblique side show – footage of anti-vax protests from around the world, or of Brazil’s blatantly anti-science president Jair Bolsonaro, or of Cohen stumbling upon a Trump rally (one man wears a “Fuck Fauci” hat) in his California neighborhood. Though France’s team considered speaking to several anti-vax leaders, the film ultimately skirts what France called “such a Gordian knot as a philosophy that it makes your brain hurt to listen to it”. “The only way to take that on is to really take that on,” he explained. “Otherwise there’s no way to understand it.” Instead, the film-makers embedded with the Rev Paul Abernathy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a black man whose organization, the Neighborhood Resilience Project, went door to door to check in on black residents and encourage vaccinations among a community skeptical from years of medical racism and institutional neglect. Abernathy embodied the energy of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, which France saw as “being the first sign of hope that literally something might come out of the ashes of Covid that would be not only acceptable but better”. If the film’s first half is a shocking success story – multiple vaccines with efficacy rates over 90% – its final section is a tragedy: the deeply inequitable distribution of vaccines, in which rich, powerful nations maintain a surplus while low-income nations struggle to reach double digit vaccination rates and protect the most vulnerable. To date, only 14.5% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose; How to Survive a Pandemic closes with the shocking statistic that if existing vaccines had been distributed equitably – as in, if every at risk person (elderly, healthcare workers) in the globe been vaccinated up to 20% of each country’s population – one million more lives would’ve been saved globally. (The global Covid death toll as of this writing is 6.13m.) “We had the vaccine quantity to do that,” said France. “The stock existed to do that.” “There were so many advances that came out of HIV/Aids,” said France, from the vaccine platforms to the global infrastructure of clinical trials. “But where we haven’t reformed is in this global sense of how you approach a viral pathogen that comes from nowhere and prowls the globe.” “No nation has relinquished that control, and it’s in their self-interest to do it,” he said, as countries from the US to India have not met pledged contributions to Covax, the World Health Organization initiative for global vaccine access. “Will we learn from it? Will we be in a better place when the next one comes? And the next one is around the corner, it’s not another 100 years – what are we going to do then?” How to Survive a Pandemic is now available on HBO in the US with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘Will we learn from it?’: David France tackles the Covid vaccine rollout in new film,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/30/david-france-covid-how-to-survive-a-pandemic-film-hbo
3/30/2022,"A standoff over biopiracy is threatening to derail a global agreement to halt the loss of nature, with developing countries demanding they are paid for drug discoveries and other commercial products based on their biodiversity. During negotiations in Geneva for a Paris-style agreement on nature, which ended this week, the use of genetic data in a digital form – known as digital sequence information (DSI) – arose as a clear point of division, with African countries insisting any deal must include a financial mechanism to compensate them for discoveries using digital forms of their biodiversity. With echoes of tensions in climate talks over the failure of developed countries to meet the $100bn-a-year climate finance target at Cop26 in Glasgow, a large group of developing countries, including Brazil, India and Gabon, also called on rich nations to pledge more than $100bn (£75bn) a year of biodiversity finance from public and private sources at the Cop15 summit in Kunming this year, reaching $700bn by 2030. At Cop15 – the 15th conference of the parties to the UN convention on biological diversity – governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity for this decade. The accord, “a Paris agreement for nature”, aims to slow rampant biodiversity loss around the world and is part of the UN’s overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The summit was originally due to take place in October 2020 but after several delays it is hoped that a face-to-face meeting will happen in 2022. Why is it a big deal?Time is running out to take action. An international group of scientists, including Prof Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, warned in January 2021 that the planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinction, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival. The world has failed to meet a single target agreed a decade ago to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems. Are only governments worried?No. At the 2021 World Economic Forum, business leaders said biodiversity loss was the third biggest existential, or long-term threat, to the world and was among the top five risks in terms of impact, alongside infectious diseases, climate action failure, weapons of mass destruction and natural resource crises. What might the Kunming agreement look like?In January 2021, the UN convention on biological diversity published a 21-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, control invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. Governments are yet to negotiate properly on the draft targets.  The disagreement came after a slow fortnight of negotiations in Switzerland, which, despite progress in some areas, left the ambition of the overall agreement in the balance. Leading conservation organisations said talks had moved at a “snail’s pace” and further negotiations have been scheduled for the end of June in Nairobi to prepare for Cop15 in China. From creating Covid vaccines to manufacturing drink sweeteners, the genetic sequences of plants, animals and other organisms in digital form have revolutionised biotechnology and life sciences research, leading to new HIV therapies, genetically modified crops and innovations in conservation. Sharing Sars-CoV-2’s genetic code in early 2020 led to the rapid creation of Covid-19 tests and vaccines. It is hoped that similar techniques will lead to new cancer drugs and other innovations in a variety of sectors. But during this week’s talks, countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean warned that DSI has become a loophole for pharmaceutical companies and others to avoid sharing profits deriving from their flora, fauna and other forms of life – what has become known as biopiracy. Sharing the benefits from genetic resources is one of the three objectives of the UN convention on biological diversity (CBD), through which governments are negotiating a Paris-style agreement for nature known as the global biodiversity framework, with draft targets to protect 30% of land and sea, reduce agricultural pollution and environmentally harmful subsidies. Pierre du Plessis, a Namibian negotiator speaking for Africa, said that without a deal on DSI he would not allow the adoption of the entire agreement, warning that Cop15 in Kunming could become a “Copenhagen moment” for biodiversity, in a reference to when 2009 climate talks in the Danish capital collapsed. “From an African point of view, we will not accept the adoption of the global biodiversity framework [without agreement on DSI]. It’s just an outcome too horrible to contemplate but if that’s what we need to do then that’s what we will do,” Du Plessis said. Africa has proposed a 1% biodiversity levy on the retail price of all products based on genetic resources and DSI, with proceeds going to biodiversity conservation around the world. The idea is likely to face significant opposition from the EU, Canada and other rich countries. An agreement on the procedures to follow when asking to use genetic information, known as the Nagoya protocol, is already in place after concerns that companies were commercialising indigenous knowledge and genetic resources for nothing. But not all countries have ratified the agreement and they are allowed to make their own rules, which has meant DSI has become a grey area. At the closing plenary session on Tuesday, countries signed off an agreement including further negotiations on DSI, which Du Plessis welcomed, but said there was a long way to go, amid fears that scientific and commercial research could get entangled in red tape if the issue is not resolved. Leonardo de Athayde, head of Brazil’s negotiating team, said DSI was an important issue for his country that should be included in the final text. “We’re open to considering different options as long as it generates money and provides an incentive also for sustainable use of biodiversity,” he said. Other states warned that without an agreement in Kunming, access to biodiversity in their country for scientific and commercial research would face increased bureaucracy. Dr Amber Hartman Scholz, a researcher from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ and a leading expert on DSI, said whatever was agreed in China must be simple while also maintaining free and open access for scientific research around the world. Currently, DSI is held on three main databases in Japan, Europe and the US. “The changes that molecular biological data is going to make to our lives in the coming decades – cancer drugs, personalised medicine, everything where nature interacts with man – that’s all based upon sequence data. It’s going to blow our minds in the next 100 years,” she said. “Sharing benefits from DSI is just, but paralysing science with red tape is not,” said Hartman Scholz. “We have to get this right.” Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China, said DSI highlighted “some of the deepest ideological differences between CBD parties”. “It is a scientifically and legally complex issue and is tightly connected to finance. With limited progress in Geneva, there are already too many bombs for Kunming to remove. DSI is certainly one of the thorniest that will detonate a chain of explosions if not managed carefully,” he said.

3/30/2022,"In 2019, Annie Ashton’s husband, Luke, closed all his online betting accounts. He confessed to her that he’d lost more money than they could afford and swore his gambling days were over. “Luke said he wouldn’t gamble any more and I fully thought that was what was going to happen – I think Luke did too,” says Ashton. “We thought it was like a switch that could be turned off. We were very naive.” The couple cleared Luke’s debts with some money they had earmarked for renovating their home in Leicester, and life with their two children, returned to normal. But, the year after, Luke was furloughed from his job as a warehouse manager at a printing firm because of the pandemic, and he began gambling again – this time in secret. Ashton remained unaware, until April last year, when her husband – usually careful with money and “careful with everything, really” – took his own life. It wasn’t until Luke’s phone was returned to her by the police that she saw any evidence that his gambling addiction had returned. “There was nothing to show in his bank account, but I was able to log in to his other accounts, including his PayPal. You could only see the last six months of transactions, but the first one I could see was a free bet.” So-called “free bets” are offered by bookmakers to entice customers, allowing them to place a bet without depositing any cash. But, even if a customer wins on a free bet, there’s usually a catch. “You often have to play free bets many times before you’re actually able to withdraw money,” says Nick Harvey​, head of external affairs at the charity Gambling With Lives. “So, if you’re given a £50 free bet or bonus, you might have to bet 30, 50, even 100 times its value before you are able to withdraw any winnings. That’s one reason why they’re so closely linked with addiction.” Ashton believes it was a free bet that caused Luke’s addiction to spiral for the first time in 2019. “Gambling was never an issue initially: we went to bingo a couple of times and he would place bets on the football at the weekend, but he never won anything. When he’d bet on Leicester [the football team he supported], they would lose – so he wouldn’t bet when they played.” When Luke’s co-workers started betting on horse racing, Luke opened online accounts using free bet incentives – and ended up taking out loans to cover his losses. Since his death, Ashton has been campaigning for the implementation of Luke’s law, which would place a ban on free bets and email incentives; last year, her petition received more than 31,000 signatures. “The idea that he was being encouraged and rewarded for doing something that would potentially kill him is hard to swallow,” she says. “If there had been interventions on the gambling sites, rather than incentives, then perhaps he would still be here.” In 2021, a Public Health England report estimated that there are more than 409 gambling-related suicides in England every year – more than one death a day. Last week, a study by the UK gambling charity GambleAware found that gambling addiction rates may be nine times higher than the betting industry claims – which the Betting & Gaming Council (BGC) have denied – with 1.4 million people harmed by their own gambling, and a further 1.5 million at risk. (It should be noted that GambleAware is often criticised because most of its funding comes from the gambling industry, although it describes itself as “accountable to the Charity Commission” and “guided by an entirely independent board of trustees, the majority of whom work within the public health sector”, as well as having “robust governance processes in place to ensure the gambling industry has absolutely no influence over any of our work”.) The BGC disputes these figures, pointing to recent research from the Gambling Commission, which found that “the rate of problem gambling is 0.3% – down from 0.6% 18 months ago”. Part of the problem is that legislation governing the gambling industry is woefully outdated: the Gambling Act of 2005 actually liberalised gambling laws, with a view to driving economic benefits. The act came into force in 2007, which, as Harvey says, was the year the first iPhone was released. Lawmakers “didn’t anticipate how big online gambling would get, and the fact that everyone could have a supercasino in their pocket,” he says. “It’s since those laws changed that suicides have rocketed.” In 2020, a House of Lords select committee found that the gambling industry spends £1.5bn a year on advertising, and that 60% of its profits come from the 5% who are already “problem gamblers”, or are at risk of becoming so. The BGC disputes this claim, saying it is a “a deliberate distortion of the findings of two separate unconnected studies”. A spokesperson also stated that: “The BGC’s largest members committed to spend an additional £100m for the treatment of problem gambling, including treatment for a minority of those who are suffering from serious addiction, between 2019 and 2023.” The Gambling Commission, which works to “raise standards in the gambling industry, protect children and the vulnerable and keep crime out of gambling”, also released a report in February, which found that “problem gamblers” were offered considerably more incentives, such as free bets, than other gamblers, with 35% reporting that they received incentives (via text message, app notification, email or targeted advertising online) every day. “The gambling industry puts the responsibility on the people who are most vulnerable, when the way they advertise is actually quite predatory,” says Ashton. “They expect people to be able to withdraw [from gambling] while they’re using every trick in the book to draw them in.” The government pledged to review gambling laws in its 2019 general election manifesto and a white paper was initially expected before the end of 2020, but, due, in part, to a ministerial reshuffle, it has been repeatedly delayed and is now expected in May. “I don’t want what happened to Luke to happen to anyone else,” says Ashton. “The delays to the white paper mean there will be plenty more people suffering.” Ashton joins a growing number of voices demanding an urgent overhaul of the gambling laws, alongside Gambling With Lives co-founders Charles and Liz Ritchie, whose 24-year-old son Jack took his own life, after developing a gambling addiction as a teenager. Last November, Ashton met the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, Nadine Dorries, as well as gambling minister Chris Philp and Iain Duncan Smith, and in February this year her petition calling for the immediate publication of the white paper, received more than 5,000 signatures in less than two weeks. She has also been in touch with Leicester City football club, to ask it to reconsider its in-stadium advertising. “Luke used to take our son Ollie to the football on the home games, and I wanted to keep the tradition going – but, when we went, Ollie picked up on the gambling ads that were flashing around the pitch straight away,” she says. “He literally sank into his seat. We’ve stopped going because it was just a constant reminder. The ads do have an impact on people – you hear it in the conversations. ‘I’ve put this on, I’ve put that on, I’m cashing out.’ It’s so embedded and normalised in sports – you can’t get away from it.” In 2019, further research commissioned by GambleAware found that problem gamblers were six times more likely to have suicidal thoughts or try to take their own life. Ashton is acutely aware that gambling addiction equates to much more than just financial losses, since “some of the bets which Luke was placing were for less than £1, but it was the frequency with which he was placing them. There were days when he was betting more than 100 times a day on his phone.” Much of Ashton’s campaigning focuses on the impact gambling can have on mental health. “You wouldn’t blame someone for getting an illness,” she says, “so why are we blaming people who have a gambling disorder, which is an illness?” Harvey agrees that there is a lot of shame associated with gambling, something that he says is “exacerbated by the ‘gamble responsibly’ narrative pushed by the industry and GambleAware. It’s advertised as just a normal, fun thing to do – and if you’ve got a problem with it, they imply, that means there’s a problem with you.” An inquest may eventually explore the role of gambling in Luke’s death but, to date, Ashton has not received any apology or acknowledgement from the gambling industry or the sites he used. A BGC spokesperson said: “Any suicide is a terrible tragedy and we are not in any position, nor would it be right, for us to comment on any individual case. As the mental health charity Mind and others acknowledge, the reasons behind any suicide are ‘complex and can have lots of different causes’.” “The industry makes its profits from the vulnerable and we know they target those people with free bets,” Ashton says. “It needs to be held accountable It’s profits over people. Luke would be proud of the campaigning I’ve done so far – but he wouldn’t be surprised.” Anyone concerned about their gambling, or that of a loved one, can visit BeGambleAware.org for free, confidential advice and support.

3/30/2022,"An installation of 13 children’s dresses made from the fabric of discarded refugee lifejackets is part of a new programme of 450 concerts announced by Wigmore Hall today. It is the first time that Wigmore Hall in London, home to the UK’s largest classical music concert programme, is showcasing an art installation alongside a specially written piece of music. The music is a new string quartet by the British composer Charlotte Bray entitled Ungrievable Lives. The 13-movement quartet, a musical response to the migration crisis, will be presented in conjunction with the art installation by British artist Caroline Burraway. It consists of 13 children’s dresses, handmade from refugee lifejackets gathered by the artist at the “lifejacket graveyard” in Lesbos, Greece. The dresses hang from old iron and brass weighing hooks, above piles of sand. Each dress represents one million of the 13 million child refugees worldwide. The orange fabric represents the absent children and is Burraway’s way to evoke memory, absence and loss. As part of the new programme, which runs from 1 September 2022-31 July 2023, 2,500 musicians from around the globe will perform 450 concerts. Among them are more than 40 premieres, including Ungrievable Lives. Leading artists who feature in the new programme include Nitin Sawhney and cellists Steven Isserlis and Sheku Kanneh-Mason. Composers in focus include Cassandra Miller, Lera Auerbach, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ferruccio Busoni. The 2022-23 concert year will see the African Concert Series make Wigmore Hall its London home. Wigmore Hall is keen to make the programme accessible to the widest possible audience including young people and those on low incomes. There will be 25,000 tickets for £5 made available to people under 35, as well as thousands of free tickets for anyone under the age of 26 through Wigmore Hall’s partnership with the Cavatina Chamber Music Trust. John Gilhooly, chief executive and artistic director of Wigmore Hall, welcomed the new programme. He said: “In times of great tumult, art and music provide precious moments of reflection, comfort and consolation. I hope Wigmore Hall continues to be a haven where audiences can experience the beauty and wisdom of great music from the most diverse possible origins. I am heartened that our £5 tickets for under 35s scheme has seen the highest ever take-up since the initiative was launched four years ago, bringing many thousands of new, young concertgoers to live performances this season. It is by a long distance the UK’s largest classical music programme.” Bray said of the inspiration behind her new string quartet: “I attempt to imagine and find some way of illustrating what millions of migrants are enduring, in search of safety or a better life. Caroline Burraway has responded to the crisis through her art since 2015 and witnessed first-hand the camps and the situation in the Mediterranean up close. Her installation forms a large part of the stimulus behind my string quartet.” Burraway described what inspired her to create the art installation fashioned from discarded refugee lifejackets: “As I stood at the edge of the chasm, it felt like a physical blow – below me mountains of discarded lifejackets, many metres deep, lay quietly abandoned, decaying, buried in the stillness of the surrounding valley. My feet sank into the depths below as I made my way through thousands of loudly shouting colours, each shape evoking the suffocating presence of an abandoned body. Straight away, I knew I needed somehow to bring a sense of this to those who neither would, nor could ever see it, never have the chance to feel it themselves.”",Arts/Music,Wigmore Hall: music and art combine to highlight child refugee crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/30/wigmore-hall-music-and-art-combine-to-highlight-child-refugee-crisis
3/30/2022,"Tributes have poured in for the cycling journalist and award-winning author Richard Moore who died on Monday, aged 49. The highly respected writer was a former racing cyclist himself, who represented Great Britain during his career and Scotland at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, where he competed in the road race and the time trial. In a moving Twitter post, the Eurosport presenter Orla Chennaoui said of the shock news: “On Monday, our hearts were crushed and the air sucked from our lungs. Words can never do justice. Richard, you were the best of us. You charged from the front. You made shit happen. You were one of the few friends who never, ever let me down. You never let anyone down.” Moore was a regular fixture in the Guardian and Sunday Times, Scottish publications such as The Herald and The Scotsman and also wrote for Cycling Weekly for a number of years. His book In Search of Robert Miller won the best biography award at the 2008 British Sports Book Awards, while he penned volumes on Chris Hoy, Team Sky, and the Tour de France. He will perhaps most be remembered in the cycling community for founding the Cycling Podcast in 2013 with journalist colleagues Lionel Birnie and Daniel Friebe. On Wednesday morning, the Podcast broke the news of Moore’s passing, stating: “Monday was an unfathomably difficult day. In the morning we received the news that our leader, lynchpin, friend and brother Richard Moore had passed away. We are all shattered. “Before the podcast’s genesis in 2013, Richard had already built one flourishing career as a brilliant, versatile and prolific author and journalist. His books won awards, his warmth and humour drew friends – an enormous circle of the most diverse personality types spanning sports and continents. “To us, he was a force of nature, unerring but above all unifying. There can be no consolation today, but the closest thing is knowing that the network of affection and love he knitted will now become an edifice of support for those most deeply affected by this loss.”",Sport/Sport,"Tributes paid to cycling journalist Richard Moore, who has died aged 49",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/30/tributes-paid-to-cycling-journalist-richard-moore-who-has-died-aged-49
3/30/2022,"Relatives of the Sandy Hook school shooting victims have rejected an offer from Alex Jones, host of the conspiracy theory and rightwing disinformation website Infowars, to pay $120,000 per plaintiff to resolve their lawsuit. The families said he defamed them by asserting the massacre never happened. A Connecticut judge found Jones liable for damages in November, and a trial is planned to determine how much he should pay the families. The plaintiffs said they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers because of the hoax conspiracy promoted on his show. The court filings posted online said: “Mr Jones extends his heartfelt apology for any distress his remarks caused.” Last week Jones defied a court order to attend a deposition near his home in Austin, Texas, to provide testimony ahead of the trial. Jones said he was ill. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday on a request by the plaintiffs to sanction Jones for not cooperating. Lawyers for the families rejected the settlement offer within a few hours, saying in court filings that it was a “transparent and desperate attempt by Alex Jones to escape a public reckoning under oath with his deceitful, profit-driven campaign against the plaintiffs and the memory of their loved ones lost at Sandy Hook”. Twenty first graders and six educators were killed in the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The families of eight of the victims and an FBI agent who responded to the school sued Jones, Infowars and others in Connecticut over the hoax conspiracy. Jones has since said he accepted the shooting did occur. Jones also was found liable for damages in similar lawsuits filed in Texas by relatives of Sandy Hook victims, and faces trial later this year.",News/US news,Sandy Hook families reject settlement offer from Infowars host Alex Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/sandy-hook-newtown-alex-jones-infowars
3/30/2022,"A Nasa astronaut caught a Russian ride back to Earth on Wednesday after a US record 355 days at the International Space Station, returning with two cosmonauts to a world torn apart by war. Mark Vande Hei landed in a Soyuz capsule in Kazakhstan alongside the Russian Space Agency’s Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov, who also spent the past year in space. Despite escalating tensions between the US and Russia over Vladimir Putin’s war with Ukraine, Vande Hei’s return followed customary procedures. A small Nasa team of doctors and other staff was on hand for the touchdown and planned to return immediately to Houston with the 55-year-old astronaut. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Vande Hei said he was avoiding the subject with his two Russian crewmates. Despite getting along “fantastically … I’m not sure we really want to go there,“ he said. It was the first taste of gravity for Vande Hei and Dubrov since their Soyuz launch on 9 April last year. Shkaplerov joined them at the orbiting lab in October, escorting a Russian film crew up for a brief stay. To accommodate that visit, Vande Hei and Dubrov doubled the length of their stay. Before departing the space station, Shkaplerov embraced his fellow astronauts as “my space brothers and space sister.” “People have problem on Earth. On orbit … we are one crew,” Shkaplerov said in a live Nasa TV broadcast Tuesday. The space station is a symbol of “friendship and cooperation and … future of exploration of space.” The war tensions bubbled over in other areas of space with the suspension of European satellite launches on Russian rockets and the Europe-Russia Mars rover stuck on Earth for another two years. Just one day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Dmitry Rogozin, the director-general of Russia’s space agency, accused the US of trying to “destroy” cooperation at the ISS. “If you block cooperation with us, then who is going to save the ISS from an uncontrolled descent from orbit and then falling onto the territory of the United States or Europe?” he said. Nasa, however, played down the provocative comments. The agency said that it would continue to work with all its international partners – including Russia – and that export sanctions continue to allow it to work with Russia. “That’s just Dmitry Rogozin,” Nelson told the Associated Press. “He spouts off every now and then. But at the end of the day, he’s worked with us. “The other people that work in the Russian civilian space program, they’re professional. They don’t miss a beat with us, American astronauts and American mission control.” The Russian invasion has resulted in canceled launches and broken contracts. Besides threatening to pull out of the space station and drop it on the US, Europe or elsewhere, Rogozin had the flags of other countries covered on a Soyuz rocket awaiting liftoff with internet satellites. The launch was called off after the customer, London-based OneWeb, refused Rogozin’s demand that the satellites not be used for military purposes and the British government halt financial backing. Meanwhile, the European Space Agency confirmed that it was indefinitely suspending its ExoMars rover mission with Roscosmos because of the war in Ukraine. “Despite all of that, up in space, we can have a cooperation with our Russian friends, our colleagues,” Nelson said. “The professional relationship between astronauts and cosmonauts, it hasn’t missed a beat. This is the cooperation we have going on in the civilian space program.” By touching down in the landing zone – roughly 400km (250 miles) to the northeast of Russia’s space launch facility at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan – Vande Hei surpasses Nasa’s previous record for the longest single spaceflight by 15 days. Dubrov moved into Russia’s top five. Both are well short of the 437-day, 17-hour marathon by a cosmonaut-physician aboard the 1990s Mir space station, which remains the world record. “Broken records mean we’re making progress,” said Nasa’s previous space endurance champ, retired astronaut Scott Kelly, whose 340-day mission ended in 2016. Like Kelly, Vande Hei underwent medical testing during his long stay to further Nasa’s quest to get astronauts back to the moon and on to Mars. He said daily meditation helped him cope during the mission, twice as long as his first station stint four years earlier. “I’ve had an indoor job 24-7 for almost a year so I am looking forward to being outside no matter what kind of weather,” Vande Hei said in a recent series of Nasa videos. As for food, he’s looking forward to making a cup of coffee for himself and wife Julie, and digging into guacamole and chips. Three Russians – who arrived two weeks ago – and three Americans and one German, who arrived in November, remain on board. Their replacements are due in three weeks via SpaceX. Next week, SpaceX will fly three rich businessmen and their ex-astronaut escort to the station for a weeklong visit arranged by the private Axiom Space. Elon Musk’s SpaceX began transporting Nasa astronauts to the station in 2020, nine years after the shuttle program ended. For most of that decade, Russia offered the lone taxi service, with Nasa shelling out tens of millions of dollars per Soyuz seat. Vande Hei’s ride was part of a barter exchange with Houston-based Axiom. The US and Russian space agencies are still working on a system in which a Russian would launch on a SpaceX capsule beginning this fall and an American would fly on the Soyuz, helping ensure a US and Russian station presence at all times.",News/Science,US astronaut returns to Earth with Russian cosmonauts after record-breaking mission,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/30/us-astronaut-nasa-russian-cosmonauts-international-space-station
3/30/2022,"About one in four pregnancies worldwide end in an abortion every year. In England, Scotland and Wales, women have had a right to this crucial form of healthcare since 1967 – but such a right is meaningless if it cannot be exercised. This fact is well understood by anti-abortion groups and legislators in the US, who, while awaiting permission from the supreme court to bring in an outright ban, are seeking to make it as difficult as possible for women to use abortion services. Now, here in the UK, women’s access to abortion is also being undermined. At the start of the first lockdown, the government approved the use of both pills in England for early medical abortions (EMA) at home. This meant that care could be delivered entirely remotely, through a virtual consultation with a qualified nurse or midwife, while the patient took the two pills involved in the procedure. The government recently announced their intention to reverse this approval. Prior to the introduction of this pathway, anyone seeking a medical abortion in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy would be required to attend an in-person appointment to receive an ultrasound scan and take the first of the two pills (mifepristone) within a clinic, with the second (misoprostol) being taken at home. The decision not to make these measures permanent goes against a wealth of robust and widely accepted, peer-reviewed evidence from medical professionals – including World Health Organization guidelines published this month – showing telemedicine to be both safe and effective. In fact, since telemedicine was introduced, the risk of complications related to abortion has reduced as women have been able to access abortion services much earlier in their pregnancy. Telemedicine has the support of organisations such as Rape Crisis and Women’s Aid. It is a disappointing change of heart from a government that said time and time again during the Covid-19 pandemic that it was committed to “following the science”. But there is now an opportunity to set this right through an amendment to the health and care bill – put forward by Liz Sugg – which would put this telemedicine pathway into legislation. Concerns have been raised as to the ability of doctors to ensure the safeguarding of patients, particularly of young people and women in abusive relationships, during remote consultations. Yet MSI Reproductive Choices UK reported a 20% increase in the number of safeguarding disclosures, including of domestic abuse and sexual violence, following the introduction of telemedicine services. As organisations such as Brook and the NSPCC have pointed out, providing remote support in a familiar environment may help service users feel more able to open up about their emotions, experiences and situations. Women have already expressed a preference for telemedicine for EMA to be available beyond the pandemic. In one study, 89% of respondents stated that they would choose this pathway again if they needed another abortion. The failure to listen to what women are asking for from abortion services greatly undermines the government’s commitment to putting women at the centre of their own healthcare as it develops a national Women’s Health Strategy. This decision is also out of step with the health secretary’s recent pledge to drive greater personalised care, set out in his speech on healthcare reform at the Royal College of Physicians. He spoke about the need to “empower patients and fulfil the promise of the technological leaps we’ve seen throughout the pandemic” – but ending access to EMA via telemedicine does anything but this. Furthermore, given that analysis has shown that the telemedicine pathway could result in savings of £3m a year for the NHS it is difficult to see how this is a decision that benefits our healthcare system. The Welsh government has decided to make telemedicine for EMA permanent in Wales. This sends a clear message that, while women in Wales can be trusted to use a healthcare service in a way that meets their needs, women in England cannot. The government has said it will review telemedicine for EMA measures in England but is unwilling to allow it to continue after August. If it is committed to enabling women to have greater control and choice over their health, we must see a detailed plan for this review – including the steps that will be taken, from whom input will be sought and anticipated timescales. Telemedicine for EMA presents an opportunity for the government to be seen as a shining light for women’s reproductive rights around the world, at a time when rights are being rolled back elsewhere. As we await the publication of the women’s health and the sexual and reproductive health strategies, I call on MPs to recognise the weight of the evidence and ensure that access to this essential form of healthcare is not restricted for women in England.
