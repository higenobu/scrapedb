2/25/2022,"Good morning. Ukrainians are being urged to resist as Russian tanks close in on Kyiv, in a day which could become the hardest day in the war, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister has said. Explosions and gunfire have been heard in the Obolonskyi area, a northern district of Kyiv, as invading Russian forces approached. Anton Herashchenko said the city’s defenders were waiting with anti-tank missiles as reports came in that tanks were advancing on the city of almost 3 million from all sides. The Ministry of Defence’s Facebook page urged civilians to resist, saying: “We urge citizens to inform us of troop movements, to make Molotov cocktails, and neutralise the enemy.” Preparation for the attack comes as Kyiv residents were woken by the sound of explosions as reports circulated that Russia had launched a series of missile strikes on the city. The UN refugee agency has predicted that 4 million people may flee Ukraine “if the situation escalates further”. The death toll in Ukraine has risen to 137 people while 316 had been wounded by Russia’s invasion and attacks, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an address late on Thursday. All men aged 18-60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine as the military mobilises, with Zelenskiy declaring martial law. Russian forces have taken the city of Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine. The city is about 200km west of the Russian border. Kyiv was shaken by explosions in the early hours of Friday, with Ukraine claiming it had shot down a Russian military aircraft over the city. The interior ministry said a residential tower block had been set alight by the falling debris. Cars queued for up to 15 hours as thousands attempted to flee Ukraine into Hungary and Poland. Fuel is in short supply, with a 20-litre fuel restriction imposed at six petrol stations and huge queues. Internal flights have been suspended. Thousands of Russians have protested against the war in dozens of cities including Moscow and Saint Petersburg, with police arresting at least 1,702 in 53 cities. Zelenskiy has pleaded with western countries to ramp up their sanctions on Russia and send more military support. In an address to the nation just after midnight, the president said: “We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of Nato membership? Everyone is afraid.” On Thursday evening, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, voiced his fury shortly before the EU decided against blocking Russia from Swift, an international payments system through which it receives foreign currency – potentially the most effective sanction the bloc could impose. “I will not be diplomatic on this,” he tweeted. “Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from Swift has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too. BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT.” Is Swift bound by sanctions? The network has resisted calls to impose bans on certain countries, but there is precedent. In 2012, the EU banned Swift from serving Iranian firms and individuals sanctioned in relation to Tehran’s nuclear programme. Russia’s ministry for the economy has responded to sanctions by saying it is developing measures to minimise their impact, with plans to expand trade with Asia. Three former Minneapolis police officers have been convicted for violating George Floyd’s civil rights. A juror in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial who might not have disclosed childhood sexual abuse during jury selection will now be questioned publicly as Maxwell’s team seeks a retrial. The Dominican Republic has begun construction on a controversial border wall with Haiti, with officials claiming it will limit the flow of migrants, drugs and weapons. Only 9% of plastic waste is recycled, meaning microplastics are everywhere. The material is difficult to recycle and slow to decay. A summit of world leaders is being held online and in Nairobi, Kenya, next week, with hopes that the first ever global legally binding treaty to combat plastic waste could be agreed upon. Musicians touring used to mean one thing: a hedonistic party life, fueled by booze and drugs. But the culture is starting to change, music journalist Hannah May Kilroy writes, with growing availability of support for those who want to stay sober. “There’s almost this unwritten rule that drugs and alcohol are a necessity if you’re a musician or in the music industry,” says Norman Beecher, who runs a workshop at Music Support, a charity specialising in mental health and addiction in the industry. “It’s a narrative that needs to change.” Major oil companies are largely all talk and no act when it comes to the clean energy initiatives they espouse, a comprehensive peer-reviewed study has found. Researchers compared rhetoric with action taken between from 2009 to 2020 from the world’s four largest oil companies, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP, finding that the firms are not transitioning their business models to clean energy. Twelve years since they first appeared on London’s streets, “Boris bikes” – named after Boris Johnson, who was mayor at the time of their introduction – have been hailed as an eco-friendly way of getting around the city. Or perhaps a bit further: a Freedom of Information request showed that the bicycles have turned up in places as far from the capital as Australia, Jamaica and Turkey.

2/25/2022,"The pictures this morning of Russian tanks rolling across the Ukrainian countryside seemed both surreal – a flashback to a Europe that we’ve seen only in newsreels – and inevitable. It’s been clear for years that Vladimir Putin was both evil and driven and that eventually we might come to a moment like this. One of the worst parts of facing today’s reality is our impotence in its face. Yes, America is imposing sanctions, and yes, that may eventually hamper Putin. But the Russian leader made his move knowing we could not actually fight him in the Ukraine – and indeed that his hinted willingness to use nuclear weapons will make it hard to fight him anywhere, though one supposes we will have no choice if he attacks a Nato member. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to dramatically reduce Putin’s power. One way, in particular: to get off oil and gas. This is not a “war for oil and gas” in the sense that too many of America’s Middle East misadventures might plausibly be described. But it is a war underwritten by oil and gas, a war whose most crucial weapon may be oil and gas, a war we can’t fully engage because we remain dependent on oil and gas. If you want to stand with the brave people of Ukraine, you need to find a way to stand against oil and gas. Russia has a pathetic economy – you can verify that for yourself by looking around your house and seeing how many of the things you use were made within its borders. Today, 60% of its exports are oil and gas; they supply the money that powers the country’s military machine. And, alongside that military machine, control of oil and gas supplies is Russia’s main weapon. They have, time and again, threatened to turn off the flow of hydrocarbons to western Europe. When the Germans finally this week stopped the planned Nordstream 2 pipeline, Putin’s president Dimtry Medvedyev said, “Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay 2,000 euros ($2,270) per thousand cubic meters!” His not very subtle notion: if the price of keeping houses warm doubles, Europe will have no choice but to fold. Finally, even the Biden administration – which has been playing its hand wisely in the lead up to the invasion – is constrained by oil and gas. As we impose sanctions, everyone’s looking for an out: the Italians want to exempt high-end luxury goods and the Belgians diamonds, but America has made it clear that it it doesn’t want to seriously interrupt the flow of Russian oil for fear of driving up gas prices and thus weakening American resolve. As one “senior state deparment official” told the Wall Street Journal this week, “doing anything that affects … or halts energy transactions would have a great impact on the United States, American citizens and our allies. So our intention here is to impose the hardest sanctions we can while trying to safeguard the American public and the rest of the world from those measures,” the official said. It’s obviously not an idle fear: as of this morning Tucker Carlson was attacking Russia hawk Lindsay Graham for supporting a conflict that will bring “higher gas prices” while he has a “generous Congressional pension”. If you’re an apologist for fascism, high gas prices are your first go-to move. So now is the moment to remind ourselves that, in the last decade, scientists and engineers have dropped the cost of solar and windpower by an order of magnitude, to the point where it is some of the cheapest power on earth. The best reason to deploy it immediately is to ward off the existential crisis that is climate change, and the second best is to stop the killing of nine million people annually who die from breathing in the particulates that fossil fuel combustion produces. But the third best reason – and perhaps the most plausible for rousing our leaders to action – is that it dramatically reduces the power of autocrats, dictators, and thugs. Imagine a Europe that ran on solar and wind power: whose cars ran on locally provided electricity, and whose homes were heated by electric air-source heat pumps. That Europe would not be funding Putin’s Russia, and it would be far less scared of Putin’s Russia – it could impose every kind of sanction, and keep them in place until the country buckled. Imagine an America where the cost of gas was not a political tripwire, because if people had to have a pickup to make them feel sufficiently manly, that pickup ran on electricity that came from the sun and wind. It would take an evil-er genius than Vladimir Putin to figure out how to embargo the sun. These are not novel technologies – they exist, are growing, and could be scaled up quickly. In the years after Hitler invaded the Sudetenland, America turned its industrial prowess to building tanks, bombers, and destroyers. In 1941, in Ypsilanti, the world’s largest industrial plant went up in six month’s time, and soon it was churning out a B-24 bomber every hour. A bomber is a complicated machine with more than a million parts; a wind turbine is, by contrast, relatively simple. In Michigan alone (“the arsenal of democracy”), a radiator company retooled to make 20m steel helmets and a rubber factory retooled to produce the liners for those helmets; the company that made the fabric for Ford’s seat cushions stopped doing that and started pushing out parachutes. Do we think that it’s beyond us to quickly produce the solar panels and the batteries required to end our dependence on fossil fuel? It’s not easy – among other things, Russia has a good deal of some of the minerals that help in renewable energy production. (Nickel, for example.) But, here again, the example of the second world war is helpful – with the Axis in control of commodities like rubber, we quickly figured out how to mass produce substitutes. It’s true that we could produce carbon free energy with nuclear power too, as long as we were willing to pay the heavy premium that technology requires – and right now Germany is probably regretting its decision to hastily shutting down its reactors in the wake of the Fukushima accident. But if you think about the scenario now unfolding across Europe, you’re reminded of another of the advantages of renewable power, which is that it’s widely distributed. There are far fewer central nodes to attack with cruise missiles and artillery shells – targeting reactors is pretty easy, but driving your tank across Europe from one solar panel to the next so you can get out to smash it with a hammer is comical. At the moment, big oil is using the fighting in Ukraine as an excuse to try to expand its footprint – reliable industry ally Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, went on Fox this week to argue that stopping the Keystone XL pipeline had empowered the Russian leader, for instance, and the American Petroleum Institute today called for more oil and gas development. But this is absurd – we may need, for the remaining weeks of this winter, to insure gas supplies for Europe, but by next winter we need to remove that lever. That means an all-out effort to decarbonize that continent, and then our own. It’s not impossible. We have to do it anyway, if we’re to have any hope of slowing climate change. And we can do it fast if we want: huge offshore windfarms in Europe have been built inside of 18 months without any wartime pressure. We should be in agony today – people are dying because they want to live in a democracy, want to determine their own affairs. But that agony should, and can, produce real change. (And not just in Europe. Imagine not having to worry about what the king of Saudia Arabia thought, or the Koch brothers – access to fossil fuel riches so often produces retrograde thuggery). Caring about the people of Ukraine means caring about an end to oil and gas.

2/25/2022,"Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group has bought Studio Retail out of administration for £26.8m, saving almost 1,500 jobs after its shareholding in the online specialist was wiped out. Frasers, which owns Sports Direct, House of Fraser department stores, Evans Cycles and the Flannels designer fashion chain, said the acquisition would provide the group with the “expertise and synergies” that would help its ambition to provide more flexible payment options. Studio Retail, which sells a mix of cut-price own-brand products from clothing and furnishings to gifts and cards, offers shoppers an account where they can choose to spread payments over many months. The group, formerly known as Findel, called in administrators to its publicly listed holding company last Thursday, wiping out shareholders led by Fraser Group, which had held near 30% stake. That came after shares in the group, which had a market value of about £100m, were suspended last week when the group said a request for a £25m loan had been turned down by its bank HSBC. The collapse of Studio Retail marks the latest in a sorry list of stock market investments for Ashley’s retail empire. The group took a hit of at least £150m on its near 30% stake in Debenhams when the then-listed department store called in administrators in 2019 while its 19% stake in Goals Soccer centre was wiped out when the five-a-side football pitch operator delisted after an accounting scandal. Ashley’s empire also bought out Game Digital, the games retailer, where it built a near 40% stake as sales fell because gamers were increasingly bypassing physical stores to buy online.",Global, Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group buys Studio Retail out of administration,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/feb/25/frasers-group-buys-studio-retail-out-of-administration-mike-ashley
2/25/2022,"When the pandemic started, most of us naively assumed it would have an end: if not a formal declaration of victory over Covid-19, with pubs running dry and strangers kissing in the street, then at the very least surely a sense of relief. We would know it was over, and could then make sense of how this collective near-death experience had changed us as a country. Unfortunately, life is never quite that neat. This week’s scrapping of England’s last remaining Covid restrictions is a choice that vaccines, antivirals and a milder Omicron variant have, arguably, allowed us to make, although it’s by no means clear that future variants will be so obliging. But the virus isn’t over, and we’re some way from making sense of anything. A much-loved face missing at dinner; an emptiness that cannot be filled. The changes wreaked by these extraordinary past two years are painfully obvious to the bereaved, those who lost livelihoods in lockdown and medical staff who saw things they won’t forget. Many parents also sense something different in their children, from the shyness of toddlers reared in lockdown to the social awkwardness of teens who spent too long interacting mainly through their phones. And too many formerly active older people are now visibly scared to go out, or hobbled by chronic illness that worsened during lockdown. But when the Pew Research thinktank asked ordinary Americans to explain in their own words how Covid had changed them last spring, what came back was a confusing mishmash. Some had positively enjoyed hunkering down at home, while others felt frustrated and lonely. Some had saved money but others piled up debt. Some loved home working and were gleefully never returning to the office, while others never left. Almost nine in 10 people described at least one change for the worse in their lives and three-quarters an unexpected upside, but most experienced both at once. The overall pattern was that there wasn’t really a pattern; the pandemic, researchers concluded, had “affected Americans’ lives in a variety of ways, of which there is no ‘typical’ experience”. But the one thing almost everyone felt was that society had gone downhill, with responses describing how Covid brought the best out in people so rare they couldn’t be reliably measured. While it’s natural to imagine that seismic social change must follow epoch-defining events, all the most dramatic predictions have so far been wrong. Employment did not collapse, triggering another Great Depression. People didn’t riot in the streets over being told to stay home. But nor did we “build back better”, constructing a greener and fairer future from the ashes. An analysis of the post-lockdown mood in Britain published this week by the authoritative social research body NatCen concludes bluntly that it “cannot be said that the pandemic has left a legacy of a public that is looking more intently to government to create a more equal society”. Support for raising taxes to spend more on health or education has fallen slightly, with no surge of enthusiasm for redistribution from rich to poor. In times of threat and hardship, people typically feel more inclined to hang on to every penny they’ve got. But if there has been no “great reset” moment, NatCen did identify a gentle acceleration of shifts that have quietly been under way for years. Back in 2010, the year they voted in the austerity government of David Cameron, 56% of Britons agreed that “if welfare benefits weren’t so generous, people would learn to stand on their own two feet”. By last summer, that was 36%. People aren’t blind to their neighbours’ struggles. Hostility to immigration has faded too, with 53% now agreeing it’s good for the economy and 49% that it’s enriched Britain culturally – up from a miserly 21% and 26% respectively a decade ago. Focus groups run by More in Common (which campaigns for social cohesion) found an enduring warmth towards NHS staff, supermarket workers, delivery drivers and people who got vaccinated to protect others. There is a better country in here somewhere trying to get out, but it needed moral leadership from a government that has repeatedly provided the reverse. (A separate study from King’s College London this week finds public trust collapsing over the past year; by the beginning of December, 62% weren’t sure they could believe what their government said.) And the angels of our better natures are struggling against the only other defining post-pandemic trend: a widespread sense of cynicism, even gloom. Even before police began investigating lockdown-busting parties at No 10, NatCen found two-thirds of Britons thought there was “one law for the rich and another for the poor”. More in Common found only 26% of Britons agreeing last November that “in this country we look after each other”, down from 46% in the summer of 2020; most now think the national mood is “everyone for themselves”. More Britons also now believe society is rigged in favour of the rich and powerful, the kind of pervasive hopelessness that fuels populism. If the past two years were sometimes frightening, it’s the next five that scare me. The lesson of the banking crash – when dramatic predictions of cashpoints running dry and society descending into anarchy also proved thankfully unfounded – is to beware the aftermath, not just the immediate crisis. It was the ensuing decade of spending cuts, stagnating wages and soaring assets that really hurt, breeding resentment, division and a politics of extremes. The looming post-pandemic cost of living crisis, which is only likely to be deepened by the fallout from Russian aggression in Europe, looks like following a worryingly familiar path. Britain is still a calmer and more pragmatic country than it sometimes looks. But while the rabble of anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists and far-right agitators brought on to the streets by Covid remains a tiny minority, it’s a warning sign of something bubbling under the surface, which will find new grievances to latch on to now that restrictions have been lifted. The earthquake may be over; the aftershock, unfortunately, has still to begin.

2/25/2022,"Pollution by toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” in America’s aquifer system has led to widespread contamination of private and public drinking water wells, data from a new study by the US Geological Survey finds. The study, published in Environmental Science and Technology, detected PFAS chemicals in 20% of private wells and 60% of public wells sampled in 16 eastern states, and offered new insights on how to predict which drinking water sources may be contaminated. Previous analyses have detailed the chemicals’ ubiquity in municipal water systems, but less is known about the scope of the problem in the nation’s private wells, from which about 43 million people get their water. “This should set off alarm bells for anyone relying on private well water,” said Scott Faber, vice-president of government affairs with the Environmental Working Group, which tracks PFAS issues. “One out of five people getting their water from wells could be drinking PFAS – that’s a big number.” PFAS, or per-and poly-fluorakyl substances, are a class of more than 9,000 compounds typically used across dozens of industries to make products water-, stain- or heat-resistant. They’re in thousands of everyday consumer products such as stain guards, cookware and waterproof clothing, and are common in industrial manufacturing. The chemicals are linked to cancer, birth defects, liver disease, thyroid disease, decreased immunity, hormone disruption and a range of other serious health problems. They’re dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they also easily move through the environment, often ending up in drinking water. Analyses of public utility records have found the chemicals to be contaminating water supplies for well over 100 million Americans, though estimates largely don’t cover private wells. No comprehensive private well monitoring system exists, many water quality standards don’t apply to them and filters installed in private wells often aren’t designed to capture PFAS. “Well owners are flying blind,” Faber said. The USGS undertook the analysis to provide data that could help regulators identify areas and wells that are at higher risk for PFAS contamination, though the data won’t automatically trigger new testing. Broadly, the research found higher concentrations in areas “affected by modern human activity” like urbanization, said Peter McMahon, one of the study’s co-authors. The chemicals were also found at a higher rate near facilities that commonly use PFAS products, like airports, military bases and chemical plants, or landfills that often leak the compounds into groundwater. Wells’ depth also plays a role, McMahon noted. Those drawing from deeper and “older” groundwater shielded from contaminated precipitation had less PFAS, while wells pulling from shallow, “modern” aquifers that cycle in contaminated surface water or rain have higher concentrations. Though wells near Memphis, Tennessee are in an urbanized area, the region’s deep, old water aquifer is largely clean, while nearly every well tested that relies on shallow aquifers in the Ohio Valley or New England regions had some PFAS in it. Aquifers with higher levels of pharmaceuticals and organic material also had elevated PFAS levels. The USGS took 254 samples from drinking water wells that draw from a network of five groundwater aquifers stretching from Maine to Illinois to Florida. The study looked for 24 kinds of PFAS and detected 14. Levels in a public West Virginia well reached about 1,500 parts per trillion (ppt), which is well above a level that public health advocates warn could cause health problems. The Environmental Protection Agency set a health advisory limit of 70ppt, though some states have limits as low as 1ppt. The study’s authors noted most samples found multiple types of PFAS, though little is known about how those toxic mixes impact health, and contamination levels could be much higher because thousands of PFAS compounds exist, but regulators typically only check for about 30. Though the PFAS crisis has come into sharper focus in recent years and the chemicals’ health risks have been clear for decades, the EPA has so far failed to act on setting enforceable water limits. The agency is proposing to set limits on two types of PFAS compounds in drinking water by 2023, but that still leaves thousands unaccounted for, and the agency has previously missed similar deadlines. In the absence of meaningful federal oversight, many states have begun setting drinking water limits. But most of the 16 states from which the USGS checked samples don’t have any standards in place, which leaves it up to well owners to protect themselves. That underscores how regulators have “failed us”, Faber said, and highlights the need to ban further PFAS production. “This is the kind of regulatory failure that should upset every American,” he added. “It should light a fire under legislators who represent rural states with contaminated military bases and industrial facilities.”",News/Environment,"PFAS pollution led to contamination of US drinking water wells, study finds ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/pfas-us-drinking-water-wells-study
2/25/2022,"For Black History Month, I conducted a panel discussion with Athletes For Hope and sponsored by Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Push Coalition. The panel consisted of family members of victims of police violence, whom I had spoken with for my recent book, Police Brutality And White Supremacy: The Fight Against American Tradition. They included Emerald Garner, whose father Eric was choked to death by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo; Michelle Monterrosa, whose brother Sean was killed in Vallejo, California by Detective Jarrett Tonn, who fired shots from an unmarked vehicle; and Ashley Carr, sister of Atatiana Jefferson who was shot dead by officer Aaron Dene in her home in Texas as she looked after her nephew. Also on the panel was hammer thrower Gwen Berry, who created a stir last year when she turned away from the flag during the anthem at the US Olympic trials. Berry listened to the painful stories of the panelists, their continued fight for justice for their loved ones and their gratitude to athletes like Berry, LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick, who use their platforms to bring awareness to police brutality in the US. Berry’s stand at the Olympic trials caused a predictable backlash from the right. Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw called for Berry to be “removed from the [US Olympic] team.” Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who was US ambassador to the UN in the Trump administration, said that the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee “should make sure that no one should go to the Olympics that does not want to represent America.” Fox News brought in Jack Brewer, a former NFL player, to condemn Berry. Brewer, who is Black, compared her unfavorably to Jesse Owens and said that there are Black people who experience “real racism” in the US but are thankful to be in this country. Berry told me that her critics’ attacks did not bother her. “I owe my critics nothing. A lot of people don’t know about these women’s stories, the families of people who died at the hands of police brutality and they are survivors, so what do I owe them [critics]? I owe them nothing, I owe these women something. I owe their families something. I owe their stories something. That’s where I stand,” she said. “Listening to these stories is heartbreaking. There are so many people who are either ignorant or blinded to what’s really happening in America. So many corporations claim they support Black Lives Matter but they do nothing to actually hold police or the justice system accountable.” Berry had experienced backlash even before her protest at the Olympic trials. At the 2019 Pan American Games, she raised a fist on the podium, and duly lost sponsors and a large part of her income. If anything, Berry’s sacrifice was more severe than those of LeBron and Kaepernick, who at least had millions in the bank from lucrative professional careers when they made their stands. “The Pan American Games are a much smaller Olympic Games, and since it was in an ‘underdeveloped country’ I didn’t know if it was going to be broadcast. But the world had an immediate reaction. I was immediately defunded by two of my biggest sponsors, Nike being one. I actually made another championship team and throughout that process they were trying to keep me from the team. They didn’t want me to participate and labeled me anti-American. But I was actually exercising my constitutional right,” Berry said. “Too often when athletes stand up for the communities they come from, they’re punished. So they shut up, and the other athletes see what happened to you and they say ‘Well, we aren’t going to say anything’ because when I lost 80% of my salary, it shut everybody up on the Olympic team. And that was done on purpose … but I have no regrets.” While there are those who still tell athletes to “shut up and dribble” or question the significance of an athlete using their platform for social justice, it’s important that we consider the opinion of people who have been directly impacted. And that doesn’t just apply to police killings. Muhammad Ali stood up for those affected by the Vietnam War and MLB player Carlos Delgado did the same for the US invasion of Iraq. Just this week Formula One driver Sebastian Vettel has boycotted the Russian Grand Prix over Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. As Emerald Garner told the panel about the comfort the likes of Berry, LeBron and Kaepernick gave her: “I want to thank all athletes like Ms Berry for standing with us. It really means a lot. Without these athletes using their platform, a lot of people wouldn’t know what happened to our loved ones. It took athletes like Ms Berry, LeBron, Colin Kaepernick to bring this to the stadiums, these arenas, these platforms where you get millions and millions of views and sometimes it leads to officers being held accountable for what they did because of the attention they brought to it. So yes it means everything.”",Sport/Sport,Athletes’ protests do matter: just ask the victims’ families they stand up for | Etan Thomas,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/athletes-protests-do-matter-just-ask-the-victims-they-stand-up-for
2/25/2022,"Would you like coffee?” Clio Barnard asks. “Is goat’s milk OK?” Ooh, that sounds exciting, I say. “There’s oat milk, too.” Barnard is scouring the fridge. “We’ve even got regular cow milk.” It’s early morning when I arrive at her house. Though, as she explains repeatedly, it’s not her house – she’s just renting it while working in London and Essex. It reminds me of Ali & Ava, her lovely new film. Every time Ali tells his friends that Ava is a teacher, she corrects him with “teaching assistant”. Details are important to Barnard. “Right, would you like some breakfast?” She couldn’t be a warmer host. Then we sit down to talk, and suddenly she’s a bag of nerves. She loses her words, apologises for going blank, and looks to her producer Tracy O’Riordan for support. She eyes my recorder enviously. “I’d much rather be the person with the tape machine on the table asking you questions.” She pauses. “I’m quite a shy person, Simon.” Barnard is also one of Britain’s most talented and original directors, largely responsible for putting Bradford on the movie map. All four of her films have been set in Yorkshire, three in Bradford. On the surface, the Bradford films are very different. The Arbor is an experimental docudrama about the life of playwright Andrea Dunbar (best known for Rita, Sue and Bob Too), who grew up on a tough estate, mothered three children with three fathers by her early 20s, was undone by addiction, and died of a brain haemorrhage at 29. The Selfish Giant, loosely based on the Oscar Wilde short story, focuses on two boys excluded from school who set themselves up as scrap dealers selling to a ruthless merchant. Ali & Ava is a feelgood love story about a couple (wonderfully played by Adeel Akhtar and Claire Rushbrook) who find each other in their 40s while emerging from the wreckage of failed relationships. Ali is Bradford-born and from a Pakistani Muslim family. Ava is Bradford-born, white, and from an Irish Catholic family. Ali works for his property-owning parents, and is something of a one-off – a landlord loved by his tenants. They meet when he delivers the daughter of his friends/tenants to the school where Ava is working as a teaching assistant. As their relationship flourishes, Barnard subtly explores themes around race, religion and older love without telling you she’s doing so. It seems such a simple film, but it is fantastically nuanced. Put The Arbor, The Selfish Giant and Ali & Ava together and they form a magnificent trilogy about life on the margins. Barnard’s Bradford is bleak and beautiful, antiquated (horses and carts abound) and modern (few communities are as mixed). Smart, feisty characters are undone by circumstance or fate, in ways that nod to Ken Loach and Thomas Hardy. Her films celebrate resilience and critique capitalism without making grand statements. They show rather than tell; images trump speech – in Ali & Ava a lengthy monologue is about 10 words long. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about her films is the way they echo each other. So the lead character in The Selfish Giant is called Arbor, after her first film. In Ali & Ava, Ava walks past the Arbor, the area of the Buttershaw estate where Dunbar lived, and in the distance we glimpse a blue plaque on the playwright’s old house. Listen closely and in the background you can hear the ghostly whisper “Andrea, Andrea”. Dunbar’s influence is still huge on her, Barnard says. Making The Arbor, meeting the people she did, changed her life. Barnard, 57, grew up in “the middle of nowhere”, about 10 miles from Bradford. Her father, John Barnard, is a Keats scholar, now married to the acclaimed biographer Hermione Lee. Her mother Kate, an artist and singer, left the family for the jazz musician Mike Westbrook when Barnard was eight years old. She and her two siblings were brought up by their father. The separation was “painful”, but now she says she considers herself lucky to have four great parents. Her love affair with film began at the age of 14 when she watched Mick Jagger in Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg’s acid trip of a movie, Performance. It was on TV late at night, and she viewed it on a black-and-white portable in her bedroom with the volume turned down. What amazed her was its ability to mess with her head. “Here’s this real rock star pretending to be one, whose sort-of girlfriend is also in the film in this crazy threesome. There was something about the real and the fictional that was really fascinating. It blew my tiny mind.” Her love affair with the city where most of her films are set began around the same time, when she had a birthday party at Bradford ice rink. “There’s a little corridor that leads off to the DJ booth and I was whisked off the ice by this boy, taken down the corridor and kissed. It was great. It was a very romantic kiss.” Bradford was another world – exciting, risky, unpredictable. After school, Barnard went on to art college in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne, where she initially drew and painted. Then she started to work with cameras, filming the images she created. Barnard moved to London, worked at MTV creating motion graphics, made experimental shorts films and taught film studies at Maidstone College of Art. In 2001, she and her then partner, the artist Adam Chodzko, had their first child (they have two boys aged 21 and 17, and co-parent) and moved to Kent because they couldn’t afford a place in London. Barnard then started teaching film at the University of Kent. She was as fascinated by theory as practice, and wondered how she could weave the two together. She was still obsessed with the same thing that had struck her when first watching Performance – representations of reality, particularly in documentaries that claim to tell the objective truth. As far as Barnard was concerned, that simply doesn’t exist; truth and reality are dictated by what film-makers allow us to see. Before filming The Arbor she spent 18 months with friends and family of Dunbar, forging relationships and building trust. “There were 80 hours of audio when I met Clio, so the first thing I said to her was: ‘Stop recording,’” O’Riordan remembers. Is that an obsessive thing? “Sometimes I think I do get a bit obsessive, yeah,” Barnard says. “Brokering these relationships takes time,” O’Riordan says. ‘The first time I went up to Buttershaw, people were just so welcoming. It was just the time you’d invested in those relationships.” Barnard’s approach to film-making was journalistic, but she also wanted viewers to question the veracity of what they were watching. In Barnard’s case, necessity was the mother of invention. Those close to Dunbar were happy to be taped, but would not be filmed. So Barnard got the cast to lip-sync to the tapes of Dunbar’s family. The end result was haunting – the voices were genuine, while the lip-syncing constantly reminded us that what we were watching wasn’t real. Dunbar’s Bradford became Barnard’s spiritual home. “The people I have met there are extraordinary. They are incredibly welcoming and generous, warm and open. Making The Arbor opened my eyes to a reality of some people’s lives that we don’t often see on the big screen.” “We could have probably made eight films out of the Arbor,” O’Riordan says. Barnard nods. “Scratch the surface of so-called ordinary lives and you find extraordinary lives.” She constructs her films by improvising scenes in workshops, then tightly scripting them and finally allowing the actors a degree of improvisational freedom in filming. The radical thing is that characters are based on specific individuals who then contribute to the making of the film via the workshops. Local people play small parts alongside professional actors. In The Selfish Giant, this was reversed – her two brilliant leads were local boys, Conner Chapman and Shaun Thomas. (Nine years on Thomas is a professional actor, playing Ava’s son in Ali & Ava.) It’s an unusually collaborative, community-minded way of working. One of the first people they met when making The Arbor was Matty Bailey, who became the inspiration for Arbor in The Selfish Giant. He was a hyperactive, streetwise 14-year-old chancer, always searching for scrap. Barnard went out scrapping with him, talked to his mother at length, and brought him on board for The Selfish Giant. When he failed to turn up to workshops, they simply moved the workshop to his family home. In one memorable scene, the police arrive at Arbor’s house to interview him under caution, and he insists they take their shoes off before entering the premises. That came direct from Matty – it’s what he always did when the police came knocking. While filming The Arbor, Barnard and O’Riordan also met Moey Hassan – a DJ, actor and landlord. Moey ended up with a small part in the film, but Barnard had already decided she wanted to base a character on Hassan. When making The Selfish Giant she met a teaching assistant called Rio who had walked out of an abusive relationship with the father of her son. Moey and Rio were the inspiration for Ali & Ava, though they have not fallen in love with each other in real life. Until recently, they hadn’t even met. In her new film, Barnard turns her camera on Holme Wood, another of Bradford’s vilified estates. Ali & Ava is a story told almost entirely through music. Ali is into bhangra, electro and Holme Wood hero MC Innes, while Ava adores country and folk. Ali gives her a lift home just after they meet, and is horrified to discover she likes country music. He thinks their friendship is over before it’s begun. “Oh that’s it,” he tells her. “I’ll pull up. That’s it for me.” They start to understand each other, fall in love and overcome obstacles, all through music. At one point they swap headphones, listen to each other’s songs, start singing and dancing to tunes they thought they hated, and find themselves connected in a moment of blissful chaos. Barnard says she was determined that Ali & Ava would be a hopeful film. “I wanted to make something that honoured the people on Holme Wood and the city they live in, and the relationship Tracy and I have got with the city because we’ve been making films there since 2008.” She says it was particularly important to make something positive in a time when we so rarely hear good news. “The way Adeel talks about it is joy is an act of resistance, and kindness is a courageous act. And we’ve seen a lot of divisiveness from politicians for their own gain, but what I’ve witnessed on the ground is people actually being extraordinarily kind and supportive to each other. And I wanted to celebrate that.” Despite the success of The Selfish Giant, Barnard has slightly fallen off the radar in recent years. When I mention it, she says she wasn’t really aware of ever having been on the radar. Again, she tells me how much she hates talking about herself. In a follow-up call a few days later, she’s the one who brings the subject up. “You know you mentioned there was a lull after The Selfish Giant. It was partly because I just wanted to be with my kids. My partner and I had recently split up, and it was so important for me to be a good mum as well as do good work.” Barnard’s last film, Dark River, was, for me, her least successful. The grim subject matter of her previous work had always been countered by the exuberance of her characters. But Dark River felt like miserablism by numbers. It had a bigger budget, a starrier cast (notably Ruth Wilson) and the Yorkshire it portrayed felt more generic than The Arbor and The Selfish Giant. Does she like Dark River as much as the Bradford trilogy? She pauses. “No,” she eventually answers. “But I stand by it.” Barnard says she was adversely affected by “a weight of expectation”. She struggles to find the right words, but suggests that the film did not grow organically like the others. “It was like trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.” Barnard believes she has learned from that experience. Now she is adapting Sarah Perry’s The Essex Serpent for TV, again with a starry cast including Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes. Is she worried that she’s moving away from what she knows best? “No, it’s just a totally different thing; a different beast.” She laughs. “It’s a different serpent I’m wrangling.” I get the feeling that she’s not yet done with her favourite city, though – that she may never be. As I leave she tells me how remarkable Rio is, and that Ali & Ava barely touches on the way she went to university, got a first-class degree and became a fully qualified teacher after leaving her abusive husband. Yes, there’s definitely unfinished business back in Bradford.

2/25/2022,"There’s nothing like parenting to open your eyes to how you were parented, and I’ve discovered that I have an avoidant attachment style. As a mother of two, I know I’m passing on the damaging legacy of being emotionally distant. I push my older child away, keeping them at arm’s length. With the youngest, who is still a baby, it’s completely different: I know they are securely attached to me … for now, at least. My mum had to retire at the age I am now (40s), as she was ill – she was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Despite having had counselling before lockdown – and having read about all possible attachment styles in books – I feel patterns repeating themselves. I want to be a warm, loving mother, and an affectionate, gregarious wife, but I don’t seem capable. My husband has said he is struggling with me “closing him down” when he tries to tell me his feelings. He is right. I do it with him and my child. If they come to me with a problem, I immediately downplay it. I am crying out for help with my fear of repeating the awful inheritance of avoidant attachment with my own children. And I want to be a better friend to myself. Your original letter was long and detailed, but at the heart of it was confusion, sadness and loneliness. I wonder if it is significant that you are the same age as your mother was when she had to give up work? But you are not your mother, and you are in control of your life, even if you don’t feel like you are. Your (self-?) diagnosis might be a barrier to allowing yourself to really feel. Analysis is useful, but it can be also be a great anaesthetic against pain; when we are constantly thinking about an issue, we don’t have to feel. Is this another defence against opening yourself up and making yourself vulnerable? I contacted psychoanalytic psychotherapist Susanna Abse. We both felt you may have some misunderstandings about attachment styles. “They’re not fixed; people’s style can vary in different situations,” Abse says. This is why some people can make us feel safe, and some don’t. “It’s in our most intimate relationships that we are most likely to be most fearful about being hurt, and this leads to us finding ways to defend ourselves,” she adds. Abse didn’t think you were avoidant: “The opposite – you seem preoccupied with how people find you, and what others will do and think. On top of that, you have a nasty internal critic which further undermines you.” She suggested: “Stop reading.” And while we noted you had tried counselling, she thought you might try a “particular kind of therapy, psychoanalytic or dynamic. One that isn’t necessarily about getting answers but where the therapist will help you work through, in real time, some of the anxious feelings that drive both the preoccupation and the remoteness.” Could you allow yourself to be a bit less guarded and more curious? This may sound simplistic, but how much exercise do you do? Doing something physical is a great antidote to thinking: it can take you out of your head. Next time your child or your husband comes to you with a problem, give yourself permission to say very little. Take a deep breath and just listen. You can even say, “I’m just going to think about that.” The “roles” of mother and wife that you hold up are ideals, but not realistic – we are human after all.

2/25/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed a schism in the Republican party between “hawks” who condemn Vladimir Putin and “America first” followers who express admiration for the strongman. But what has united the two wings so far is an opportunity to score political points by casting Joe Biden as weak and paying the price of failure in Afghanistan. The split was evident on Thursday as Republicans in Washington condemned Putin as a “war criminal” while many grassroots conservatives attending a conference in Florida agreed with former president Donald Trump that the Russian autocrat is “savvy”. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, described Putin as a “thug” and criticized Biden for being too slow to impose tough sanctions. “Sadly, deterrence after the fact is not deterrence at all,” he said. Senator Lindsey Graham, who is both a Trump ally and traditional hawk, added: “The Biden administration continues to misread the moment ... We should move ahead forcefully against Putin, a war criminal, and demand our allies join us.” Even Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader in the House of Representatives who is typically loyal to Trump, focused his statement on Putin’s invasion as “reckless and evil” and echoed Biden by saying the Russian president “must be held accountable for his actions”. But 850 miles away in Orlando, there was less sense of urgency at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual gathering dominated by Trump where party stalwarts such as McConnell and Senator Mitt Romney have long been persona non grata. The Ukraine crisis did feature in some speeches and panel discussions but played second fiddle to domestic issues such as “cancel culture”, mask and vaccine mandates in the coronavirus pandemic and the teaching of “critical race theory” in schools. Anyone listening to diatribes by Ted Cruz, senator for Texas, or Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, would never have guessed that Europe’s biggest military conflagration since 1945 was taking place. But Josh Hawley, a rightwing senator from Missouri who backed Trump’s false claim of a stolen election, did cut through the apathy to address the crisis, suggesting that it was down to “weakness on the part of Joe Biden”. He said: “He comes to office and what does he do? He shuts down American energy production and greenlights Russian energy production. He greenlights Putin’s pipeline and he shuts down American pipelines. Is it any wonder that Vladimir Putin feels emboldened to do whatever the heck it is he wants to do?” Hawley used this argument to call on Biden to “open up American energy” production with no mention of the climate crisis. He added: “We are the number one energy producing nation in the world – or we should be. Joe Biden gave that away. “It’s time to take it back. And if you want to send a message to Vladimir Putin, here’s a message to send him: ‘We are going to be the ones who supply the oil and gas to the world. We’re going to shut down your energy sector and we’re going to open ourselves like you’ve never seen it before.’” Earlier, the conference heard a similar message from K T McFarland, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser. Wearing yellow as an expression of solidarity with the Ukrainian people, she claimed that energy independence had been a key part of Trump’s strategy. “We could replace Russia, we could replace other countries in the world as the world’s dominant energy supplier, but it would also drive the price of oil down. That’s key for Russia. If oil is at $40 a barrel, which it was when president Trump left office, the Russians are broke. They can’t afford to go to war, war is expensive.” McFarland added: “Now, president Biden comes in, what does he do? Well, if president Trump liked it, Biden hated it, so he immediately shut down the American energy industry. Oil and natural gas, the energy that we were exporting to other countries, stopped as well. What happened? The price of oil went sky high. Vladimir Putin’s rich, he gets to choose when to invade.” Trump, who has frequently expressed admiration for authoritarians, this week praised Putin’s invasion of separatist areas of Ukraine as “genius”, “savvy” and “smart”. Mike Pompeo, his former secretary of state, has called Putin “talented”, “savvy” and a “capable statesman”. And Tucker Carlson, a leading host on the conservative Fox News channel, told viewers: “It may be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious, what is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?” Interviews with attendees at CPAC found sympathy for such views. Marnie Allen, 51, said of Putin: “Obviously he is much more savvy than Joe Biden or else he wouldn’t have walked into Ukraine and taken over an entire country with barely a shot fired so far. You can be a military genius and a jerk at the same time.” Allen, a higher education manager who lives in Orlando, was wearing a “Let’s Go Brandon” (rightwing code for insulting Biden) t-shirt and a “DeSantisLand” cap. She said he used to be a hawk but was “shown the right way” and now considers herself “America first”. She said of the invasion: “One tweet under President Trump, it wouldn’t have happened.” Tom Freeman, 66, vice-president of a retail company and a self-described “studier of history”, agreed: “I don’t think they would have done it had Trump been the president.” Asked about Trump’s descriptions of Putin as “genius,” “savvy” and “smart”, Freeman, from Jupiter, Florida, replied: “Well, I don’t think any of those are falsehoods. Putin’s always been full of shit but he’s very powerful and he’s certainly more savvy than our President Joe Biden.” Others at CPAC appeared ready to understand Putin’s point of view. Sam Leiter, 56, said: “I guess you could say he’s following his interest. The reason why Putin is popular in Russia is because he flexes Russian muscle: he acts like a tough guy. He’s kind of Russia’s Al Capone, I guess, but he’s doing what’s in their best interests.” Leiter, a speech therapist from Baltimore, Maryland, elaborated: “If you’re Vladimir Putin and you want a fresh water port and you want access to the land that Ukraine has and you see what Biden did in Afghanistan, you have to be an idiot – really stupid – not to take this opportunity to go and do whatever you think it is in your country’s interest.” Lauren Lamp, 22, from New York, said: “It’s a perfect storm for him. You have Biden who’s like, ‘You did this, let’s put sanctions.’ They’re not going to undo what’s already happened. Putin’s not going to be like, ‘Oh, you know what? We’re just going to pull back now.’ No, they’re going in for all of Ukraine and maybe farther and it’s very strategic on his part because there’s nobody to stop him, especially now that they’re friends with China.” Many here are convinced that, had Trump served a second term, the war would not have happened. Lamp, who works in corporate bankruptcy, asked: “Would Putin have ever done this when Trump was in office? Absolutely no, and that’s because Trump in himself was a big enough deterrent and Putin was like, ‘You know, we don’t want to mess with that bear’.” In reality Trump lavished praise on autocrats such as Putin and infamously exchanged “love letters” with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. But some analysts felt that Trump embodied “madman theory” of foreign policy and there were benefits to his volatile unpredictability. Nikki Murphy, 35, a healthcare worker in Winter Haven, Florida, said: “When your mother disciplines you and has rules and boundaries, you’re going to listen to her, you’re going to not cross those boundaries. That’s how Trump treated foreign countries with an iron fist. They knew that he was probably crazy enough to go through with his threats, so they did not try him.” In the CPAC corridors and exhibitor halls, there was little sense of a global tragedy unfolding. Asked if she fears escalation into a third world war, Rachel Sheley, 53, a chief information security officer from northern Kentucky, said with a laugh: “Well, if it does, it might be a good opportunity to get certain people out of power. You know what I mean?”",News/US news,‘War criminal’ or ‘savvy strongman’?

2/25/2022,"An estimated 450 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict in Ukraine so far and Vladimir Putin failed in his military objectives on the first day of fighting, the UK defence secretary has said. Wallace also rebuffed pleas on Friday morning from Ukrainian and some Conservative politicians for the UK to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, arguing that introducing one would amount to declaring war on Russia. “Our assessment as of this morning is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives, in fact it is behind its hoped-for timetable,” Wallace told Sky News. “They have lost over 450 personnel. One of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite Spetsnaz [special forces] has failed to be taken. In fact, the Ukrainians have taken it back. “So, I think contrary to great Russian claims, and indeed President Putin’s sort of vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause – he’s got that completely wrong. The Russian army has failed to deliver on day one its main objective.”In a later exchange on BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme, the Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko pleaded with Wallace for the UK and the US to close airspace above Ukraine “in order for these casualties not to escalate”. However Wallace said this would constitute a direct act of aggression towards Russia, which would prompt a response, and result in “war across Europe” as any attack on the UK would implicate all other Nato members.Wallace said: “To do a no-fly zone I would have to put British fighter jets against Russian; Nato would have to declare war on Russia.”He added: “I cannot and won’t trigger a European war but I will help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can support them.” Vasylenko warned that Europe is already at war, since “if Ukraine is allowed to fall others will follow”, and other democratic nations should seek to protect a fellow sovereign country. “What you are witnessing is a restructuring of the defence and security framework we are so used to,” she said. She said present sanctions were “not enough” and Ukrainians were disappointed by the lack of support. “We are going into over 24 hours of full on war with the biggest military power in Europe and still nothing.”Wallace said that although Britain wants the Swift global payment system turned off for Russia it is “not in our control” and is being blocked by other member countries. Britain has been pushed for Russia to be removed from Swift but has so far failed to win wide support among members of the G7. What is it? Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of deals. Who owns it? Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members. Why would a Swift ban be so serious? Boris Johnson told MPs it would harm the Russian economy if it was locked out of Swift. Run of the mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays. Why is the US reluctant to effect a ban? One reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries which have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage to the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies. He said the UK had supported accelerating Ukraine’s Nato membership, which would have triggered military intervention from fellow members, but that other countries had been concerned by the pace.He added that other democratic countries have a “moral duty” to continue to arm the Ukrainian forces since it is widely acknowledged that Putin “won’t stop at Ukraine” and will train his sights on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania after, since he “doesn’t believe the Baltic states are countries”.He told Sky News: “What you’re seeing on your cameras today is illogical. Putin didn’t need to do this, he didn’t need to occupy a sovereign country. None of the reasons why he would do that stack up. He’s not doing something that’s logical, he’s doing something about his ego and his legacy.” In that interview, he added that Putin and Russian military commanders of all rankings “will be held responsible” for their involvement. “Putin has to fail … because he’s fighting our values and all the human rights that we stand for. I don’t know if he’ll fail in Ukraine, we’ll do everything to make sure he does, but if he doesn’t we’ll make sure he fails after that.”",News/World news,"Russian army failed to deliver key military goals on day one, says Ben Wallace",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/putin-ukraine-russian-army-failed-to-deliver-key-military-goals-day-one-ben-wallace

2/25/2022,"John Lewis is ditching its “never knowingly undersold” price match pledge after almost a century, saying it had lost relevance at a time when it faces stiff competition from online retailers such as Amazon. The staff-owned department store chain said it had made the decision to retire the well-known slogan this summer because its price promise did not apply to online-only retailers, and shoppers were increasingly buying online. John Lewis said it would, however, invest £500m in lowering prices to offer customers “everyday quality and value” at a time when consumers are facing a squeeze on disposable incomes as bills rise and pay growth fails to keep pace with inflation. It will also expand its Anyday cut-price range. Under the never knowingly undersold slogan, which John Lewis introduced in 1925 , the chain commits to refund customers the difference if they find the same item on sale elsewhere for a lower price within 28 days. The retailer first revealed the pledge was under review in March 2020, a month after Sharon White joined as chair. Analysts said John Lewis was likely to introduce a new marketing slogan when the NKU pledge was phased out this summer. Department stores are facing heavy competition from Amazon and other online specialists and the never knowingly undersold scheme cost millions of pounds, as the retailer was forced to cut prices whenever a rival held a sale. The change in tactics comes amid increasing pressure from inflation, driven by increases in the prices of energy, raw materials and transport, which has made shoppers increasingly price conscious. Pippa Wicks, an executive director of John Lewis, said: “Customers are tightening their belts and we’re responding so John Lewis is more affordable for every customer, every day, whether shopping in-store or online. “Never knowingly undersold has been a cherished sign of trust for John Lewis for a century but it doesn’t fit with how customers shop today as more purchases are made online. Our new £500m investment means all our customers can trust they’re getting the quality, style and service they expect from John Lewis at great value prices.” John Lewis said it expected to invest more in its Anyday cut-price range, which it introduced in April last year and which has notched up £125m of sales since then. John Lewis said a quarter of the 2 million shoppers who had bought the brand over the past nine months were new to its stores. This year the brand will extend to swimwear, children’s clothing and an extended range of outdoor furniture. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said the change was “long overdue, as a policy devised back in 1925 was hardly likely to last long into the internet age and nobody quite understood what it meant anyway”. He expects John Lewis to protect its profit margins despite the increase in investment on price and quality promised by the business.",News/Business,John Lewis drops ‘never knowingly undersold’ pledge,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/john-lewis-drops-never-knowingly-undersold-pledge
2/25/2022,"Shortly after the coronavirus pandemic started, everyone in the Guardian’s product and engineering department, along with the majority of colleagues in our organisation, started to work entirely remotely. The product and engineering department had to adapt quickly and we seized the opportunity to review our interviewing process. Our goal was to simplify the process, making it appealing for candidates while keeping it fair and efficient. In this article we will highlight some of the changes we made and will outline what applying, interviewing, and starting work as a developer at the Guardian looks like today. The first step we took was to remove the requirement for a cover letter for most of our roles. We decided that relevant topics would be better talked about during a video call interview, rather than just being read. Applicants are still welcome to include a cover letter if they would like, but it is not strictly necessary to apply for a role with us. The second step we took was to remove the initial phone conversation, which cut down the process from three to two stages. After reviewing previous interviews, we didn’t see this as a helpful step to filter candidates before the next stage, and decided we could cover useful bits in the other two stages: a video interview and a remote pair programming exercise. These are scheduled separately and include different interviewers. Each stage offers a chance to ask questions about what it is like to work in our teams. Where can I find open positions? Apply for one of our open positions here. What can I expect from the interview process? We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible in our hiring process. Similar to other organisations, there is a CV screening, phone interview, coding exercise and a face to face interview. Read more about what to expect and apply now here. - This new stage is an initial conversation with two members of our engineering team that (for most roles) lasts an hour. Some questions focus on technical topics and your understanding and experience working with them. They are not trick questions, trivia, or algorithm based. Other questions revolve around your experience and thinking when working in teams – an important aspect of the work we do at the Guardian. We also want to understand your motivations to work with us and hear your passion. The second and final stage is an hour-long exercise in which you will work with a Guardian engineer to write code to solve a problem, defined by the interviewer at the beginning of this session. The exercise will be chosen from a list of existing problems publicly available on the Guardian GitHub repository. These are in a selection of common languages, or you can set up your own from scratch. The setting up is not part of the test and will not be assessed, and we expect you to set this up prior to the interview to allow you to spend time on the actual problem to solve. What the interviewer is interested in is how you approach the problem, what you prioritise, how you think about a solution, and how you communicate your thinking throughout the session. They will also focus on how you respond to suggestions and advice. It is an approximation of the experience you’ll have when pairing with a colleague. You will be the driver, sharing your screen, and the interviewer will be the navigator, making comments and asking questions. We pay close attention to the process, not just how far you get through the exercise. The focus is not on syntax, language, or IDE knowledge. You are encouraged to search online for whatever you may need to work on the problem. The session is not a competition, it’s a chance for you to work with a partner – so feel free to ask, challenge and learn from them. This is also a good opportunity for you to understand if this is type of environment suits you. About a week after your remote pairing exercise, you should receive a phone call from our HR colleagues to let you know how you did and whether or not you have an offer. The decision is based on discussions and voting by colleagues who participated in the different stages and got to know you. This is to have multiple interviewers with different views and opinions, with a particular emphasis on assessing candidates as fairly and consistently as possible. The team you are placed in is based on your experience and the requirements within the department. It is worth emphasising here that when you are hired, it is because you are seen as a great addition to the department as a whole, rather than to a specific team. Once you are here, you will have numerous opportunities to collaborate with other teams and for team rotation. The time between your offer and your start date can vary depending on the notice period of your current job but if you have the flexibility, you could start within a couple of weeks. During the pandemic, we had to adapt our process to make sure new starters were able to start without needing to go to the office. We now ship laptops to your home address before your start date and your manager will set up an initial one-to-one video call with you to get introduced and guide you through your first day. This whole experience has enabled us to evolve our model to be more remote-friendly. We see real value in face-to-face collaboration but we also understand the benefits of working remotely and the flexibility this offers. In particular, we want to build diverse and inclusive teams, where everyone can do their best work. Different roles carry different expectations, and as a software developer we’d typically expect you to join the office, on average, twice a month for specific activities. During your onboarding, you will now have the opportunity to meet your team colleagues in person and get to meet colleagues from other parts of the organisation. We have adapted well to this new remote modality. Our people are very connected and have great interactions. The culture is very welcoming and people are helpful and understanding. There is a strong collective focus on finding a good work-life balance and staying comfortable and healthy. Finally, while we are remote-friendly you are required to work from the UK for administrative and legal reasons, but when travelling for short periods of time in countries you have the right to work some exceptions can be made.",News/Info,How we have changed our application and hiring processes,https://www.theguardian.com/info/2022/feb/25/how-we-have-changed-our-application-and-hiring-processes
2/25/2022,"Afew months ago, Paul Van Haver, better known as the Belgian singer-songwriter/rapper Stromae, announced his comeback. In the French-speaking world, this was big news. As the 00s turned into the 2010s, Stromae had established himself as one of the biggest Francophone artists in the world. He sold 8.5m albums. His single Alors On Danse went to No 1 in 19 countries: in 2010, it was the most-played French-language song in the world. Its level of success was almost freakish, leading to the assumption that he was, as he puts it, “a one-hit wonder … when you have a hit people say it’s going to be the only hit in your life”. But he wasn’t. His second album, 2013’s Racine Carrée, spent five years in the French chart: it was the best-selling album of the year twice on the trot. He was critically acclaimed for a kaleidoscopic sound that takes in everything from Congolese soukous to knowingly cheesy Europop to the mordant chanson of his countryman Jacques Brel, an unpredictable mishmash that he thinks is rooted in his peripatetic childhood. His largely absent father was Rwandan – he was killed in the 1994 Rwandan genocide – and his Belgian mother was an inveterate traveller. “Sometimes we loved it and sometimes it was pretty close to a nightmare, because we didn’t have a lot of money, so they weren’t all-inclusive vacations,” he says. “Sometimes good memories, sometimes really bad, but memories you don’t forget.” He became so famous that he launched his own fashion label in conjunction with his wife, a stylist. English-speaking artists seemed to be queueing up to work with him: Kanye West jumped on a remix, Lorde invited him to appear on the soundtrack for The Hunger Games, on which he collaborated with Pusha T, Haim and Q-Tip. And then, in 2015, Stromae suddenly stopped. He pulled an African tour after suffering what he calls “a black hole” on stage. Speaking on Zoom from his French record company’s offices, it’s not something he wants to discuss in depth (“it’s really personal, so I prefer to keep that for me”), but it sounds like a panic attack. “It was kind of a burnout, and also because of a medicine called Lariam” – an anti-malaria medication that lists among its panoply of potential side-effects severe anxiety, paranoia, confusion, hallucinations, dizziness, shortness of breath and blurred vision – “but it was a really bad story.” As a result, he avoided public appearances for the best part of three years, questioned whether he would ever make music in the future and kept a low profile. He released a solitary track in 2018 to tie in with his latest fashion collection and briefly turned up on Coldplay’s 2019 album Arabesque, but that was pretty much it. “It was important for me just to heal and get better,” he says. Under the circumstances, you can see why Stromae’s first album in nine years, Multitude, is considered a very big deal. But it wasn’t just that he had decided to return. It was the way he chose to do it. In January, he turned up on a Sunday-night news broadcast on the French station TF1, ostensibly giving a straightforward interview, then, in answer to a question about mental health, suddenly started performing his new single L’Enfer. He insists that the first part of the interview was real enough – “I didn’t know any of the questions, except the question [that was the cue] before I was to start singing” – but the whole thing was, in fact, a setup. Cue much controversy and debate. How dare someone turn a news broadcast into an advert for their new single, ran one argument in the French press. Isn’t every interview on a current affairs show with an artist who has something to promote just a glorified advert, another countered. Stromae had considered the potential for a backlash. “I’m not a political figure, it’s just about music, but you’re right: it’s an ad,” he says. “So I think it’s pretty honest and modern from TF1, because TF1’s news on Sunday, it’s kind of a dinosaur, you know? But when an actor [is interviewed] on the news, it’s the same. He’s not revealing himself, he’s just acting, he’s just telling a story, so it’s between an act and a kind of a fiction.” Whatever viewers and commentators thought about it, it was a very Stromae thing to do. Aside from his music, one of the things Stromae is famous for is blurring the lines between fact and fiction. There was the controversial video for his single Formidable, which consisted of hidden camera footage of him stumbling around the streets of Brussels, apparently drunk, complete with bystanders filming him on their phones, passersby attempting to help and the police intervening. The idea, he explains, came from a video shot by an intrusive fan that went viral and made the national news. Stromae was eating in his car when a guy wielding a cameraphone knocked on his window and asked him: “‘Why are you in this shitty car, you have so much money?’” he recalls. “I was like, this viral video has more success than the video I just released? OK, so they want blood, I will give them blood.” And there was the video grandly titled Stromae Takes America, featuring him busking around New York and being roundly ignored by passersby. There was a grain of truth at its centre. For all the high-profile co-signs, the English-speaking world has yet to take to his work with the kind of enthusiasm shown elsewhere, beyond a brief flash of success for Alors On Danse and some love on the hipster blogs. While Spanish-language artists such as Bad Bunny are now among the most successful in the world, Francophone acts haven’t had the same kind of crossover. While you can appreciate the music on a song such as Multitude, which reaches back to Stromae’s childhood visits to Bolivia with his mother and features Chinese strings, it’s hard for non-French-speakers to grasp the blackly comic view of fatherhood on C’est Que du Bonheur without the aid of translation, meaning you miss out on his ironic juxtaposition of standard parenting platitudes with observations from its more visceral side. His son was born in 2018, a period that left its mark on the record. “Yeah, I talk a lot about poop and pooping in general on this album,” Stromae says, laughing. “I actually had my hand in the shit for two years. There are so many songs that say ‘I love you, you’re the best thing in my life’, and that’s the reason I wanted to give another point of view.” Still, he says, maybe there’s a positive to some audiences not understanding his lyrics. “There’s a lot of songs, even in French, that I couldn’t understand when I was young. I understood them when I was 20, and I was like, ‘Whoa, nice, another vision, another point of view of a song I’ve loved since I was seven.’ I think it’s the same with other languages – if you take the time to translate it, you go, ‘OK, I didn’t know it was about this.’ You don’t have to understand it if you feel it. It’s first a question of emotion, I think, and then, if you start to dig in, you discover meaning.”  Multitude is released on Island/Universal on 4 March",Arts/Music,"Pranks, panic attacks and baby poo: Belgian pop star Stromae on his first album in nine years ",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/25/pranks-panic-attacks-and-baby-poo-belgian-pop-star-stromae-on-his-first-album-in-nine-years
2/25/2022,"“They have only one objective: to prevent the development of Russia. They are going to do it in the same way as they did it before, without furnishing even a single pretext, doing it just because we exist.” These were Vladimir Putin’s words on 21 February, in his now notorious speech on Ukraine. They repeat the argument already formulated in his speech on Crimea in March 2014: “The politics of the containment of Russia, which continued throughout the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, continues today. There is a constant attempt to push us back into a corner because we have an independent position, because we stand up for ourselves.” Putin’s vision of Russian history is one of an emergence continually blocked by enemies. The contemporary “west”, in this vision, battles to contain Russia out of jealousy. Europe has collapsed into decadence, crushed by the weight of its humanism and political liberalism: tired, divided, at the mercy of every passing wind. The United States, mired in an instrumental, materialist culture and the contradictions of its own history, is in the process of losing its pre-eminence. Russia, by contrast, like its emerging ally, China, is on the rise in civilisational terms. Putin leans here on a strange theory advanced by the 20th-century historian and ethnographer Lev Gumilev. The son of two of Russia’s most famous poets, Nikolai Gumilev and Anna Akhmatova, Gumilev maintains that every people possesses a distinct life force: a “bio-cosmic” inner energy or passionate substance that he calls passionarnost. Putin may have known Gumilev in St Petersburg at the start of the 1990s. At any rate, he has embraced his ideas and never misses an opportunity to refer to them. In February last year, he said: “I believe in passionarnost. In nature as in society, there is development, climax and decline. Russia has not yet attained its highest point. We are on the way”. According to him, Russia carries the power and potential of a young people. “We possess an infinite genetic code”, he has said.In addition to Gumilev, Putin relies on another thinker – a minor figure in the history of Russian thought. Last October, he spoke of regularly consulting a collection of political essays titled Our Tasks, the major work of Ivan Ilyin, who died in 1954. In one of the president’s preferred essays, “What does the world seek from the dismemberment of Russia?”, Ilyin denounces the country’s “imperialist neighbours”, these “western peoples who neither understand nor accept Russian originality”. In the future, he suggests, these countries will inevitably attempt to seize territories such as the Baltic countries, the Caucasus, central Asia and, especially, Ukraine. The method, according to Ilyin, will be the hypocritical promotion of values such as “freedom” in order to transform Russia into “a gigantic Balkans”. The final object is to “dismember Russia, to subject her to western control, to dismantle her and in the end make her disappear”. It is necessary, then, to understand that what is actually happening in Ukraine is the result of a vision of Russia that is deeply embedded in the mind of Putin. In 2008, he punished Georgia for its desire to leave the orbit of the old imperial power. In 2014, he annexed Crimea and prevented Ukraine from joining Nato by starting the Donbas conflict. But that is not enough for him. He wants a confrontation with – and a victory over – a west that he holds responsible for the fall of the Soviet Union, for the weakness of Russia in the 1990s, and for the autonomous tendencies of the old Soviet republics. Why now? In the years following his re-election in 2018, the patriotic exaltation that followed the annexation of Crimea faded. Everyday problems for ordinary people – declining living standards, increased poverty, inflation, a healthcare crisis – have become worse year by year. Meanwhile the US has become more preoccupied with China than Russia. So in July 2021, Putin published the infamous article in which he proclaimed the unity of the Russian and Ukrainian people. The Ukrainians, he maintained, could not be left to suffer indefinitely under an illegitimate government, which came to power in what he described as a coup d’etat in 2014. Putin massed his troops on his neighbours’ borders from the spring. He intensified military preparations in the autumn and issued his ultimatum to Nato and Washington. He set a carefully laid trap for the west, knowing it was impossible to accept his demands. Everything was ready for what followed. As in 2008, Russian state media echoes Putin in evoking the risk of a genocide. In place of the Ossetians, supposedly menaced by the then Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, this time the victims to be defended are in Donetsk and Luhansk. The manufacture of this humanitarian crisis may, for Putin, carry a pleasing element of irony. He has never forgotten Nato’s bombing of Belgrade in the spring of1999, a few months before he became prime minister. By parodying the language of ethnic cleansing and genocide (the Russian-speakers of Donbas this time, rather than the Kosovars), Putin wishes to cancel out the affront caused by that episode in the darkest way imaginable. What should we think of this perpetual sense of victimhood that allows the Russian president to artificially create situations in which Russia appears humiliated and insulted. Are these the actions of a rational leader? The answer is both simple and worrying. Putin has developed, over decades, a vision of the world that is paranoid but coherent. According to this vision, Russia has for centuries been the victim of an attempt to contain and dismember it. These attempts must be resisted. The logic of this is based on a belief that Russia’s passionarnost must not be constrained. For Putin – in stark contrast to the tired westerner, lost in the search for profit and material comfort, “the Russian man thinks first of all … in relation to a superior moral principle”. And he is prepared to die for it. Putin often cites a well-known Russian saying: for Russians, “even death is beautiful”. There may, therefore, be no limits to the quest to avenge perceived humiliation. The president’s worldview paves the way to extremism.
