 Republican Sen. Roger Marshall (Kan.) plans to introduce the ""Fauci Act"" after he clashed with infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci at a Senate hearing this week. Marshall will be introducing the Financial Accountability for Uniquely Compensated Individuals (FAUCI) Act after he said Fauci's records were not readily accessible to the public, a spokesperson for the senator told The Hill. The Fauci Act would require the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) website to provide the financial records of administration officials like Fauci and a list of those in the government whose financial records are not public. The move comes after Fauci was caught on a hot mic calling Marshall a ""moron"" for not knowing the Chief White House medical adviser's financial records were public. ""I don't understand why you're asking me that question,"" Fauci said at the hearing after being questioned by Marshall about the records. ""My financial disclosure is public knowledge and has been so for the last 37 years or so."" ""All you have to do is ask for it,"" Fauci added. ""You're so misinformed, it's extraordinary."" The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit journalism center, found that Marshall was incorrect about Fauci's public finances being private, but said it is hard to obtain them. A reporter for the center wrote that to get the records she had submitted a completed OGE form 201 to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Freedom of Information office, and then ""politely badgered"" the NIH office after not hearing back about her request for a month. She said in total the process had taken more than two months. ""The NIH also chose to give the disclosure to me under the Freedom of Information Act, which they didn't need to do and caused the document to be partially redacted. (Though most of the information about Fauci's income, gifts and investments in 2019 is still there for all to see.),"" the reporter stated.",Politics/The Hill,GOP senator plans to introduce 'Fauci Act' after clash at hearing,https://news.yahoo.com/gop-senator-plans-introduce-fauci-002241393.html
1/14/2022,"For companies that were waiting to hear from the U.S. Supreme Court before deciding whether to require vaccinations or regular coronavirus testing for workers, the next move is up to them.  Many large corporations were silent on Thursday's ruling by the high court to block a requirement that workers at businesses with at least 100 employees be fully vaccinated or else test regularly for COVID-19 and wear a mask on the job.  Target's response was typical: The big retailer said it wanted to review the decision and “how it will impact our team and business.” The Biden administration argues that nothing in federal law prevents private businesses from imposing their own vaccine requirements. However, companies could run into state bans on vaccine mandates in Republican-controlled states. And relatively few businesses enacted their own rules ahead of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirement, raising doubt that there will be rush for them now. In legal terms, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority said the OSHA lacked authority to impose such a mandate on big companies. The court, however, let stand a vaccination requirement for most health care workers. The National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail trade organization and one of the groups that challenged the OSHA action, called the court’s decision “a significant victory for employers.” It complained that OSHA acted without first allowing public comments, although administration officials met with many business and labor groups before issuing the rule. Chris Spear, the president of the American Trucking Associations, another of the groups that fought the OSHA rule, said it “would interfere with individuals’ private health care decisions.” Karen Harned, an official with the National Federation of Independent Business, said that as small businesses try to recover from nearly two years of pandemic, “the last thing they need is a mandate that would cause more business challenges.” But mandate supporters called it a matter of safety for employees and customers. Dan Simons, co-owner of the Founding Farmers chain of restaurants in the Washington area, said vaccine mandates are “common sense.” He requires his 1,000 employees to be fully vaccinated; those who request an exemption must wear a mask and submit weekly COVID test results. “If your priority is the economy, or your own health, or the health of others, you would agree with my approach,” Simons said. Administration officials believe that even though the OSHA rule has been blocked, it drove millions of people to get vaccinated. But companies that used mandates to achieve relatively high vaccination rates may decide that they have accomplished enough. Ford Motor Co. said it was ""encouraged by the 88% of U.S. salaried employees who are already vaccinated."" The car maker said it would review the court decision to see if it needs to change a requirement that most U.S. salaried workers get the shots. Labor advocates were dismayed by the ruling. “This decision will have no impact on most professional and white collar workers, but it will endanger millions of frontline workers who risk their lives daily and who are least able to protect themselves,"" said David Michaels, who led OSHA during the Obama administration and now teaches at the George Washington University’s School of Public Health. For their part, labor unions had been divided all along  about Biden's attempt to create a vaccine mandate, with many nurses and teachers groups in favor, but many police and fire unions opposed. Some unions wanted the right to bargain over the issue with companies. The United Auto Workers, which encourages workers to get vaccinated, said the decision won't change safety protocols such as face masks, temperature checks and distancing when possible for more than 150,000 union members at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis factories.  The Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million service industry workers, said the Supreme Court’s decision is a relief for health care workers but leaves others without critical protections. “In blocking the vaccine-or-test rule for large employers, the court has placed millions of other essential workers further at risk, caving to corporations that are trying to rig the rules against workers permanently,” the union said. The union called on Congress and states to pass laws requiring vaccinations, masks and paid sick leave. Workers also need better access to testing and protective equipment, the union said. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, the largest union for grocery workers and meatpacking plants, said that the Supreme Court decision fails to recognize the “extreme health risks” America’s front-line food and retail workers face on the job. “Frontline workers need to be protected and this decision needlessly ignores that there was a better way to address this issue without negating this mandate,"" said Marc Perrone, president of the UFCW International in a statement. Meanwhile, employers have been split on what to do with their unvaccinated workers. Among 543 U.S. companies surveyed in November by insurance broker and consulting firm Willis Towers Watson, fewer than one in five required vaccination. Two-thirds had no plans to require the shots unless the courts upheld the OSHA requirement. Jeff Levin-Scherz, an executive in the firm's health practice, said most companies with mandates will keep them because they are working. He said nothing short of a mandate can get vaccination rates to 90%, and “you really need a very high level of vaccination to prevent community outbreaks.” United Airlines was one of the first major employers to announce a mandate, back in August. CEO Scott Kirby has said that 99% of United employees either got vaccinated or submitted a request for exemption on medical or religious grounds.  United declined to comment Thursday, but in earlier comments Kirby has sounded committed to the mandate for his employees because “it was the right thing to do for safety.” Airlines fall under a separate Biden order that required federal contractors to get their workers vaccinated. That requirement was not part of Thursday's Supreme Court ruling, but it has been tied up separately since early December, when a federal district judge in Georgia issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the mandate.  ___ AP Staff Writers Anne D'Innocenzio in New York, Paul Wiseman in Washington and Dee-Ann Durbin and Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to read that Marc Perrone is the president, not the CEO, of the UFCW.",Politics/Associated Press,Businesses react to ruling against Biden vaccine mandate,https://news.yahoo.com/businesses-react-ruling-against-biden-002546007.html
1/14/2022,"Two videos that show the daughter of WSPA news anchor Amy Wood using racist and homophobic language have surfaced across numerous social media and websites Thursday. Both videos were first posted by the Instagram account @saucecarolina. The account stated in a direct message that it would not reveal the initial source of the videos. The Herald-Journal will not post the videos on our site due to their racist and homophobic language. Wood's daughter, Gracie, has not released a statement. Amy Wood posted a statement to her Facebook page Thursday night apologizing on behalf of her daughter and family for the ""horrific, disgusting, and vile things my daughter said on the videos so many of you have seen."" Wood also said her family would be working together to learn and grow stronger in their beliefs of equality and inclusion. The Herald-Journal also attempted to call WSPA general manager Kenny Lawrence for comment on the video. The first video was posted on Wednesday, while the second video was posted Thursday night. Gracie is popular on Instagram and is a singer and songwriter. She debuted her own song, ""You Ain't My Boo"" on Spotify and had nearly 30,000 followers on Instagram before deleting her account. Her Twitter account has also been removed. Wood is a senior at Oakbrook Preparatory School in Spartanburg and performs with the school's theater department and is a member of the volleyball team. Oakbrook Prep released the following statement on its social media platforms as well as a letter to school families Wednesday evening: ""We have been made aware of recent statements made by an Oakbrook student. While these statements were made off campus in a non-school related event, we find these comments and the behavior of those involved offensive and extremely disappointing. The statements made are not reflective of Oakbrook's mission and core values, which are academic excellence, character, community, creativity, and diversity. As advocates for all God's people, we strive to create a community that is respectful and inclusive based on Biblical principle and appreciates the richness of different cultures and viewpoints. Our school leadership is prayerfully considering actions that we can take to reinforce our core values, enable our students and staff to learn from this experience, and promote a caring environment where everyone in our community feels respected and valued."" Upstate activist Bruce Wilson, of Black Lives Matter and Fighting Injustice Together, said that he spoke with Amy Wood and her husband, Mike Wood, a Spartanburg County magistrate judge, Wednesday evening. Wilson said the Woods were apologetic. ""They were absolutely mortified by this and I could generally feel how apologetic they were because they understood this hurt so many people,"" Wilson said. ""I believe there was some peer pressure involved in this, and this type of talk and behavior wasn't taught in their home."" Wilson expressed he has no desire to see Amy Wood held responsible for something her teenage daughter did or said. ""There needs to be consequences. I believe this incident will probably affect her (Gracie) a lot in the future and affect her now."" Wilson said. ""And it’s painful to hear that language, especially for Black people, Jewish people and gay people."" ""Words do have meaning, words do have power."" Wilson continued. ""Unfortunately, she (Gracie) wasn’t wise at the time and her 'so-called friends' used that."" This is not the first time a Spartanburg teen has gone viral in a controversial video. In May 2021, ""American Idol"" contestant and Dorman High School student Caleb Kennedy left the show after reaching the Top 5. His departure came after an old Snapchat video began circulating online. Many Spartanburg residents viewed this as a teachable moment for teens to understand why words and symbols matter.  This is a developing story. Check back for more information.

1/14/2022,"By Anna Ringstrom STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden's military said on Thursday it was ramping up its visible activities on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland amid increased tensions between NATO and Russia and a recent deployment of Russian landing craft in the Baltic. Moscow has spooked the West by massing troops near Ukraine, sparking fears that it is considering invading. Moscow denies any such plans, saying it can deploy forces on its territory however it chooses. Gotland, Sweden's biggest island, is strategically important and lies around 330 kilometres (205 miles) from Kaliningrad, the headquarters of Russia's Baltic Fleet. In 2019 Sweden deployed an updated ground-to-air missile defence system on the island. Lieutenant General Michael Claesson, Chief of Joint Operations at the Armed Forces, told Reuters that from Thursday troops were patrolling the harbour and airport of Visby, Gotland's main town. Sweden is not a NATO member but has close ties to the Atlantic alliance and has been beefing up its armed forces after decades of neglect amid increased anxiety over Russian sabre-rattling in the Baltic Sea region. Claesson said the Gotland move was triggered by Russian landing ships entering the Baltic Sea this week and followed years of deteriorating security conditions, including in Sweden's immediate geographic vicinity. ""Recent security developments and tensions at security policy level have not changed that picture but rather reinforce it,"" he said, adding that the armed forces had recently noted an expansion of foreign offensive capability near Sweden. ""... Russian landing ships are an example of such offensive capability,"" he said. ""They have passed through (Denmark's) Great Belt strait and continued into the Baltic Sea."" Claesson said the armed forces were also taking action in other parts of Sweden in response to recent Russian moves but declined further comment. Sweden's top military commander said last week that Sweden's security strategy would be entirely undermined if NATO agreed to refrain from expanding further and to curb some of its activity in Europe, as Russia has demanded.
