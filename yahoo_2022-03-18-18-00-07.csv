3/18/2022,"BRUSSELS (AP) — In an underground archive below NATO’s headquarters lies a key document that sets out the vision of both NATO and Russia about their future ties, as it was shaped almost a quarter of a century ago. The room is sealed. White gloves must be worn to handle the text. “NATO and Russia do not consider each other as adversaries. They share the goal of overcoming the vestiges of earlier confrontation and competition and of strengthening mutual trust and cooperation,” reads the preamble of the NATO-Russia Founding Act, signed in May 1997. Things looked brighter then, less than a decade after the Iron Curtain collapsed and relations between Moscow and the West had thawed. Today, with thousands of Ukrainians sheltering in bunkers across the country and with millions forced from their homes, the document appears to be a dead letter. When the act was signed, the post-Cold War period was ushering in a time of defense spending cuts as the threat from Moscow receded. NATO and Russia made important pledges on arms control and improved transparency about their military activities. Most importantly, they committed to limit the deployment of their forces in Europe. On Wednesday, lamenting Russia’s “brutal invasion” of Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Europe’s biggest land war in decades will “change our security environment"" and will have “long-lasting consequences for our security, and for all NATO allies.” In talks at NATO’s Brussels headquarters, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his counterparts are weighing what defenses to set up on the organization’s eastern flank, from Estonia in the north through Latvia, Lithuania and Poland down to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea. The aim is to deter President Vladimir Putin from ordering an invasion any of the 30 allies; not just for the duration of this war but for the next 5-10 years. Before launching it, Putin had demanded that NATO stop expanding and withdraw its forces from the east. The opposite is happening. “We are reinforcing our collective defense – hundreds of thousands of troops on heightened alert, 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe, and then 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the alliance, supported by naval and air forces,” Stoltenberg said. The ministers are expected to task NATO military commanders with drawing up options for stationing troops more permanently and in greater number in the east – unlike the rotating battle groups totaling around 5,000 troops that were deployed to the Baltic states and Poland in recent years. Those options will be studied by NATO leaders at their next major summit in Madrid in June. The opinion of U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts, who will also meet in Brussels next week, about the state of the NATO-Russia Founding Act could not be clearer. In a statement last month, the leaders said that Russia’s actions are “a flagrant rejection of the principles enshrined in the NATO-Russia Founding Act: it is Russia that has walked away from its commitments under the Act.” “President Putin’s decision to attack Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake, for which Russia will pay a severe price, both economically and politically, for years to come,” they said.",World/Associated Press,Russia's invasion drives NATO rethink of Europe force stance,https://news.yahoo.com/russias-invasion-drives-nato-rethink-103721226.html
3/18/2022,"By Yimou Lee TAIPEI (Reuters) - China sailed an aircraft carrier through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday, shadowed by a U.S. destroyer, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, just hours before the Chinese and U.S. presidents were due to talk. China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has over the past two years stepped up its military activity near the island to assert its sovereignty claims, alarming Taipei and Washington. The source, who was not authorised to speak to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the carrier Shandong sailed close to the Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen, which sits directly opposite the Chinese city of Xiamen. ""Around 10:30 a.m. the CV-17 appeared around 30 nautical miles to the southwest of Kinmen, and was photographed by a passenger on a civilian flight,"" the source said, referring to the Shandong's official service number. The USS Ralph Johnson, an Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyer, shadowed the carrier, which did not have aircraft on its deck and sailed north through the strait, the source added. Taiwan also sent warships to keep an eye on the situation, the source said. Taiwan's Defence Ministry declined to comment but said its forces always keep close tabs on Chinese activity in the Taiwan Strait and ""respond in accordance with standard procedures"". U.S. Navy spokesperson Lt. Mark Langford said the Ralph Johnson had ""conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit March 17 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law"". He did not elaborate. Chinese Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian referred questions to the Defence Ministry - which did not immediately responded to a request for comment - but said the Shandong has a ""routine training schedule"". ""We should not associate this with the communication between the heads of state of China and the United States. You may think it is too sensitive. What is sensitive is you, not the Taiwan Strait,"" Zhao told reporters in Beijing. The sailing happened about 12 hours before U.S. President Joe Biden is due to speak to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The source described the timing of the Shandong's movement so close to that call as ""provocative"", and that it was unusual it sailed during daylight hours, with previous missions happening at night. Last April, China's navy said a carrier group, lead by the Liaoning, the country's first aircraft carrier put into active service, was carrying out routine drills in the waters near Taiwan. Taiwan is already in a heightened state of alert due to the Ukraine war, wary of China taking advantage of the situation to make a move of its own, though there have been no signs Beijing is about to mount any kind of military strike. China says Taiwan is the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with the United States. Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, but is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier. Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claims and has repeatedly vows to defend its freedom and democracy. The Shandong is China's newest aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2019. In December 2019, shortly before presidential and parliamentary elections in Taiwan, the Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a move condemned by Taiwan as attempted intimidation. Taiwan's air force also scrambles aircraft almost daily to see off Chinese warplanes flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone, mostly to the southwestern part of the strait at the top end of the South China Sea. Taiwan calls this ""grey zone"" warfare activity, designed to both test its responses and wear out Taiwan's air force.

3/18/2022,"Most of Russia's military offensives in Ukraine continue to be stalled amid fierce Ukrainian resistance, but Russia's military continues to fire dozens of missiles and rockets at Ukrainian civilian and military targets every day, a senior U.S. defense official said at a briefing in Brussels on Wednesday. The U.S. estimates that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""around 75 percent of his total military committed to the fight in Ukraine,"" the official said, clarifying later that the 75 percent figure mostly refers to ""battalion tactical groups, which is the units that he has primarily relied upon."" ""At the height of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we were about 29 percent committed,"" former U.S. Army Europe commander Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges noted Tuesday at the Center for European Policy Analysis think tank. ""And it was difficult to sustain that."" Britain's Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that given Putin's significant ""personnel losses"" in Ukraine, ""Russia is redeploying forces from as far afield as its Eastern Military District, Pacific Fleet, and Armenia. It is also increasingly seeking to exploit irregular sources such as private military companies, Syrian and other mercenaries."" The U.S. official said the Pentagon has seen the Russians ""deliberate and discuss the possibility of resupply to include replacement troops,"" and given the deaths, injuries, and defections they are suffering every day, ""it certainly stands to reason that they would want to be exploring options to replenish those losses."" However, ""we haven't seen any indications that anything is moving right now outside of what they have already in Ukraine,"" the official said, cautioning that ""we still assess that they have the vast amount of their combat power available to them"" in Ukraine. ""It's pretty clear that Russian generals are running out of time, ammunition, and manpower,"" CEPA's Hodges wrote. ""There is no suggestion that the Russians have big units lurking in the woods somewhere,"" and ""it's apparent that the notional 900,000 strength of the Russian military is a hollow number. "" Russia will call up another 130,000 conscripts on April 1, he added, but while ""the Ukrainian diaspora is flocking home to help the fight; Russians are not coming back home — and indeed, many are leaving to avoid Putin's fight.""
